elements on Earth (average abundance < 1 ppb) and is of fundamental importance for our modern high-tech industry due to its high thermal stability (melting temperature beyond 3100 \u00b0C). Yet the enrichment process of Re in ore deposits is little understood mainly due to the difficulties to perform experiments at extremely high dilution levels and simultaneously at high P\/T conditions. The new ESRF-extremely brilliant source capabilities and several recent technical developments at the ESRF beamlines FAME and BM23 allow overcoming these limitations. We therefore propose to study systematically the solubility and speciation of Re in fluids as a function of P\/T and fluid composition using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) X-ray spectroscopy. The new data will improve our understanding of Re mobilization in magmatic systems and its enrichment process with implications for the exploration of Re.","77":"Magnetism of Ir4+ compounds hinges upon their proximity to a dimerization instability that binds unpaired electrons into Ir-Ir bonds and renders the system non-magnetic. We propose temperature-dependent high-pressure XRD measurements that will explore this dimerization instability in MgIrO3 and ZnIrO3, two novel compounds prepared from the previously known beta-Li2IrO3. This parent compound becomes dimerized under pressure of several GPa, but MgIrO3 shows partial dimerization already at ambient pressure, despite its larger unit cell volume that nominally corresponds to a negative pressure applied to beta-Li2IrO3. Experimental information on the temperature dependence of the dimerization transition, phase coexistence upon the transition, and the structure of the dimerized phase will be used to understand the origin of this transformation that controls magnetism of iridates.","78":" Mn3Sn is a magnetic Weyl semimetal exhibiting a large anomalous Hall effect without net magnetization at room temperature, opening the possibility for spintronic memory without stray fields. These fascinating properties emerge from the nonzero Berry curvature in the inverse triangular antiferromagnetic structure on the Kagome lattice of Mn atoms. The nonzero Berry curvature is attributed to the existence of local cluster multipole moments, a generalization of the uniform magnetization in ferromagnets. This notion has been supported by the disappearance of terahertz anomalous Hall effect upon entering the helical magnetic state. We aim to understand the evolution of collective spin excitations across the topological phase transition, by utilizing high-resolution soft-x-ray RIXS at the Mn L3 edge.","79":"micro-texture analysis","80":"This study aims at a better understanding of asphalt pavements ageing and recycling which are essential issues for environmental reason.The loss of elasticity of aged bitumen, and the increase of its fragile character favour cracking of roads and could be closely related to the evolution of the collo\u00efdal asphaltene aggregated structure with slow ageing of the bitumen binder in asphalt pavements. We propose to perform USAXS measurements on aged bitumen treated with rejuvenators in order to check  there influence on the bitumen collo\u00efdal structure, a major issue for the road construction industry whose goal is to increase significantly the proportion of recycled  old pavements for the construction or maintenance of roads. We therefore expect  to characterize the multiscaled aggregated structure of the colloidal asphaltene phase of bitumen samples at the 10-1000nm scale, and its evolution with:  a) ageing, b) rejuvenating treatments c) temperature at the fluid\u2013viscoelastic transition.","81":"We propose to explore the origin of an interesting stripe strain network we have recently discovered inside  ferroelectric barium titanate oxide (BTO) nanocrystals. These strain stripes support the existence of local rhombohedral polar nanoregions (PNRs), not reported in nanocrystals before. We plan to use Bragg coherent X-ray imaging (BCDI) to study the temperature dependence of these PNRs in our sample. The 250nm single crystals are an ideal size and have internal 50nm well-defined strain stripe domains networks which are resolvable by BCDI at ID01.  Crystals will be first selected at room temperature, then ramped up in temperature to cross the ferroelectric phase transition at 413K where the PNRs are expected to vanish.  The evolution of the PNRs and reversibility of the network formation will thus be tracked in a single nanoparticle.  The nanomaterial has potential in ferroelectric memory applications.","82":"The proposal aims atconducting operandoHERFD-XANES studies at Pd L edges for a Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2three-way catalyst for elucidating detailed mechanistic aspects of the concurrent CO and C3H6oxidation and NO reduction reactions by: (1) probing the interaction with the different reactant molecules under various gas atmospheres and temperature conditions, and (2) performing spatially resolved measurements along the cat-alyst bed.","84":"We aim at exploring the stability of ordered arrays of supported tiny Pt clusters under pre-catalytic conditions (i.e. exposed to low pressures of O2, CO, CO+O2 and increasing temperature). We already showed that Pt clusters organize on a template consisting of a thin alumina film on Ni3Al(111) with a density 3 or 9 times higher than palladium, depending on the growth conditions. These tailored ordered arrays open the way to explore the emerging topic of single-atom catalysis by using surface science techniques in order to understand the link between atomic-scale properties and catalytic performance. By combining GISAXS and GIXRD to in situ monitor the clusters' growth and (dis-)organization, we intend to i) follow the structural and morphological evolution of the clusters arrays and the substrate when exposed to gases and ii) determine the pressure and temperature limits up to which catalytic studies can be performed, while keeping a good spatial organization.","85":"Even after decades of research, the main bottleneck in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is the inefficient catalyst for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limiting both maximum current density and efficiency. Recent studies have shown that shape-controlled octahedra oh-PtNiIr nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit 3-fold increasement in activity when compared to commercial Pt catalyst and are almost 3 times more durable than undoped oh-PtNi catalyst in standard RDE experiments. However, when transferred into the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a fuel cell, these catalysts suffer severe degradation under high current density operation. The reason for such a loss in mass activity is unclear and crucial to understand, in order to use these materials in commercial cells. We would like to perform an operando SAXS\/WAXS measurement to track down the oh-PtNiIr NPs\u2019 degradation processes at high current densities available in the PEMFC device.","86":"Investigation of the compositional existence  field  of (Cu-Zn-Mg-Co-Ni) high  entropy oxides (HEO) by high resolution diffraction: line profile and lower symmetry distortion Temperature stability: distortion evolution and phase segregation.

This can be achieved using Cu catalyst in GDE (Gas Diffusion Electrode) flow electrolyzers, overcoming the mass transport limitations. While Cu catalyst behaviour in traditional cells is well described, it is not clear how this knowledge translates into the advanced GDEs configuration as this arrangement was proposed only very recently. In this proposal, we aim to fundamentally understand the relation between the catalytic efficiency and selectivity, local reaction environments, morphology and chemical state of Cu in GDEs at commercially-relevant current densities. This study will provide rational guidance for improving the performance of GDE based high-rate CO2 conversion devices for low-carbon economy.","94":null,"95":"The proposal aims at exploring liquid crystal (LC) ordering in a novel nanocomposite system obtained by mixing two LC solutions: the lyotropic nematic (N) phase formed by a rod-like aramid polymer and the colloidal N phase comprised of graphene oxide (GO) platelets. A recent work suggests that the formation of a hybrid (macromolecular + colloidal), possibly biaxial, N phase is crucial to get a stable casting solution and, upon drying, composite polymeric films with highly enhanced mechanical properties. Beyond its technological relevance, studying this system is also interesting from a fundamental perspective, as it could represents a rare example of the much sought-after biaxial N phase and, as such, an ideal system to test the predictions of theoretical models. This goal is made experimentally challenging by the hybrid nature of this system, with its constituents exhibiting LC order at very different length scales, nanometric for the polymer vs. micrometric for the GO platelets.","96":"The REBa2Cu3O6+x family (RE=rare earth atom) represents one of the most studied faimly of cuprates.

Those measurements done on as-grown and  post annealed nanowires under oxygen atmosphere will give us a deep insight into the physicochemical processes during the formation of ZnO NWs and the related gallium incorporation mechanisms which will offer a general strategy for their extrinsic doping and open the way for carefully controlling their physical properties as required for nanoscale device engineering.","98":"In this proposal we investigate the effect the effect the incorporation of amino acids into the lattice of magnetite crystals has on the structure, microstructure and correlate these effects to measured magnetic properties.

Sequential works at ID11 and ID22 at ESRF not only unveiled the nature of this transition and its dependency with doping, but also established the local persistence of the distortion up to the Curie temperature of the material (TC = 858 K). \r\nSingle crystal diffuse scattering measurements on high-purity Fe3O4 and Fe3-xZnxO4 will allow the three-dimensional nature of this local distortion and its sensitivity to doping to be seen. Moreover, by heating up the samples in air, the effect of local defects due to oxidation on the diffuse scattering will be unveiled. ","104":"The increased adoption of Li-ion batteries in large scale applications, such as electromobility, pushes the limits of the capabilities of the technology. In particular, the Li-ion needs to reach every increasing charging current to meet the ever increasing demands of the technology. Fast-charging is crucial in the adoption of electric vehicles and decreasing so-called \u2018range anxiety\u2019, however fast-charging can lead to critical failures of the Li-ion battery due to the formation of Li-dendrites, when Li plates on the anode instead of being intercalated. Here we propose an experiment operando x-ray tomography experiment, using the ID19 beamline, to directly monitor a graphite anode under fast-charging conditions in order to investigate when and where Li-plating starts and the evolution of the process in real time.

It has been shown that HTS are characterized by a charge density wave (CDW), whose role on the superconductivity is still debated. It is then natural to ask if a CDW is present also in infinite-layer nickelates. In a previous RIXS experiment [proposal HC-4166] we observed a pronounced maximum at Q\/\/ = (0.33, 0) [r.l.u.] for the quasi-elastic RIXS intensity in a NdNiO2 sample characterized by a short c-axis and insulating behaviour similar to bulk. Thus, we believe that a study of several Nd1-xSrxNiO2 samples prepared in different conditions, and characterized by different c-axis, doping x and transport properties is a necessary step to definitely access a link between the observed CDW and the superconducting state in infinite-layer nickelate thin films.

Advances in theory, spectroscopy and biomimetic synthesis have revealed much of its chemistry, but key details remain unresolved. Last year, we introduced calcium valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy (Ca VtC XES; 4030 eV) and detected subtle changes in Ca coordination environments in a series of synthetic models of the OEC. Here, we propose to use the new tender X-ray spectrometer at ID26 to perform Ca VtC XES on PSII. By correlating spectra for two catalytic states to extensively-validated computational models, we hope to further our understanding of OEC catalysis, while developing the practical knowledge required for future studies of the complete catalytic cycle in this little-studied energy regime. To our knowledge, ID26 offers the only apparatus presently capable of performing Ca VtC XES on dilute biological systems.","124":"The proposed experiment is focused on investigation of microstructure and thermal properties of an organic \u201cdouble discotic\u201d semiconductor with exceptional in-plane and out-of-plane charge mobility. We are planning to perform microfocus diffraction experiments combined with ultrafast heatings and coolings of thin films to determine thermal regimes for formation of columnar liquid-crystalline (LC) phase with conjugated junctions between neighbouring columns. These junctions provide formation of a continuous conjugated network in LC phase that is the reason for unusually high out-of-plane charge carrier mobility.","125":"Immobilisation of enzymatic cascades in porous materials is ideal to perform multi-enzymatic biotransformations in industrial settings. Yet, they suffer from exhaustion processes that hampers their use for long operational periods. The exact mechanism of inactivation is unknown until now, but spatial re-organisation of enzymes across the material or loss of metal ions from their active centers seems to be relevant. Unfortunately, optical microscopy is not ideal to study those events, as labelling enzymes with fluorescent tags can alter their catalytic properties. We intend to acquire X-Ray Fluorescence maps at ID16A on methacrylate beads carrying a cascade formed by Zn and Cu-dependent enzymes used to transform diols to relevant lactones, both before and after their operational run. This will provide valuable information on the importance of enzymatic re-organisation and metal leaching for the deactivation of immobilised multi-enzyme systems upon operation in chemical manufacturing.","126":"Solid-state electrolytes are not flammable and should allow the use of high capacity lithium (Li) metal negative electrode, thus being one of the viable solutions that could stimulate a breakthrough in battery safety and energy density. The interfacial contact between solid electrolytes and the electrodes causes several issues: increase of interfacial resistance at the positive and negative electrodes, volume changes, reactivity between the solid electrolyte and the electrode materials, lithium dendrites formation. In this proposal, we aim to investigate in situ samples and operando cells to characterize the structural and chemical interfacial degradation between the electrodes (Li metal anode and sulfur cathode) and the solid electrolyte using X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) and absorption\/phase contrast tomography.

Our analysis of the structural basis of CO2 fixation and the synthesis of the green-house gas methane will help to engineer these processes as tools in climate control. Furthermore, we are interested in plant-pathogen interactions and the function of nucleotide derived signalling molecules in cellular stress physiology and organization.

","129":"The main objective of this study is to investigate the incorporation mechanism of the fluid mobile element (FME) strontium in hydrous minerals (serpentine) from HERFD-XANES measurements on natural rock samples. This information is essential to better predict fluid-related geological processes in subduction zones that are not captured directly in natural obducted rocks, including the discharge depth of fluids, their pathways and sources of arc magmas. Data on FME incorporation in minerals of natural rocks are presently not available because the signal of highly diluted trace elements is often obscured by those of major coexisting elements. HERFD-XAS measurements permit to extract the signal of a single element contained in micrometric size mineral phases, but require a high photon flux.

We recently discovered that heating Fe3O4 above ~400 K results in a cation reordering and consequently a hole self-doping effect which alters short-range correlations at the octahedral sublattice. Strikingly, four regimes of self-doping can be identified that map the temperature depenendence electrical conductivity and magnetism up to the Curie temperature providing an elegant descriptor of correlations.

Despite greater volume fraction of non-metallic inclusions, they surprisingly play no significant role in fracture initiation for low triaxiality cases. The study proved that ductile fracture is initiated by the coalescence of small voids nucleated from second phase carbide particles in every case.

Our recent lab-based work has shown that the UO2 (001) surfaces oxidise to form U3O8 (130) in a topotactic transformation. This study aims to investigate this transformation using in-situ x-ray diffraction measurements of a UO2 (001) single crystal thin film as it is oxidised by heating in an oxygen atmosphere. The high flux, and nm beam size at ID11 uniquely enable us to measure single crystal diffraction from such a small sample.

Herein, we propose a combined XAS\/XRD investigation for targeting Fe(II) sites in three novel biomimetic MOFs, capable to form Fe(IV)=O species active towards MTM oxidation in mild conditions using O2 as oxidant and RT, making them a rare example for MTM by O2. Experimental evaluation of the catalytic path is critical to understand the reactivity, to this aim, we propose this in situ experiment targeting Fe(II) sites during MTM oxidation with the plus of performing the characterization of the elusive Fe(IV)=O intermediate, stable in these materials when kept at 150 K, making possible its detection with spectroscopic methods. The resulting electronic\/structural insights on Fe active sites and reactive intermediates are expected to unlock unprecedented spectroscopic details and structural information.","340":"Liquid mixtures of simple solvents can form nanosized clusters, even relatively far away from their critical point. We propose to revisit the monophasic region of these seemingly simple mixtures, as the mesoscale inhomogeneities they exhibit can explain unusual chemical (re)activity, solubilisation properties etc. We focus on the case of ternary mixtures where two largely immiscible fluids are homogenised with the addition of a solvotrope. We will determine the location of two important pseudo-phase boundaries that we identify as the Lifshitz line and the Widom line, in two similar ternary mixtures: water\/ethanol\/1-octanol and water\/ethanol\/2-ethyl-1-hexanol. The later is an isomer of 1-octanol, with a greater propensity for self-aggregation in the form of rings rather than chains, making it far more difficult to pack. We will map the phase diagrams by in situ auto-dilution, and will complete our study with temperature scans to characterize the critical exponents of these systems.","342":"We aim to combine 2D surface (SEM) and 3D bulk observations (synchrotron) in order to study the initial stages of damage in IN718 samples under Stress Assisted Grain Boundary Oxidation (SAGBO) conditions.

Currently, however, the models for the evaluation of the load-deflection curves suppose the application of infinitely stiff diamond indenter tip and neglect its elasto-plastic deformation. The aim of this proposal is to perform in-situ experiments using a custom micro-mechanical system developed for ID13, which will be equipped with a dedicated wedge tip. The in-situ scanning experiments on soft and hard samples thin films will be used to assess both (i) the stress-strain evolution across the samples under the indenter and, additionally, (ii) the stress-strain evolution across the wedge indenter tip.

Fusion properties are key for the prediction and theoretical description of the DES\u2019s liquid window. Tetraethyl ammonium halide salts (Et4NX) are common DES constituents, but their fusion properties are inaccessible under typical experimental conditions owing to thermal decomposition. Additionally, Et4NX salts show extensive polymorphism, making phase assignment from calorimetric data challenging.

This is a unique phenomenon among reported TE materials; however, its origin remains highly debated. Several scenarios have been proposed among the most likely one, but not completely accepted, relates the low \u03baT to a highly anisotropy in the phonon scattering. This may be related to the Sn\u2013Se bond anharmonicity and anisotropy. This kind of information with a local character and dependence on the solid's vibrational properties could be only accessed by spectroscopies at local-range, as the case of EXAFS or Raman.

In an applied field, the material undergoes a series of pronounced metamagnetic transitions, at 3.5 or 5.0 T (depending on the field direction), at around 20 T, and 50 T. The compound lends itself particularly well to ion-specific studies of magnetism, which we have already used in a resonant x-ray scattering study of the 3.5\/5.0 T transition. Here, we propose to use the unique microcoil XMCD setup at ID24 to efficiently characterize the evolution of the Nd and Ir magnetic states up to 30T.","418":"While the release of wear debris form orthopedic implants with metal-on-metal articulating surfaces is commonly described in literature, the effects of the slowly but steady metal release from the loadbearing but non-articulating implant components is disregarded or ignored.

It involves introducing a micro speckle pattern on the specimen mid-plane around a through-hole and imaging its evolution during shock loading. The strain field is extracted through digital image correlation (DIC) of the micro speckle pattern.

This changed rapidly in the last decade, as tremendous progress was achieved in the single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) field. Meanwhile, cryo-EM became the method of choice to determine the structure of such complexes, opening a new era of structural biology. In this BAG we will, using cryo-EM, determine the structures of complicated protein machineries including large multi-subunit complexes, protein-nucleic acid complexes and membrane protein complexes.

This evidence might suggest a possible role spin excitations have in the formation of these modulations. To this aim, we will investigate with RIXS YBCO at different doping levels with full polarization control of the incident and scattered beams at the CDF wavevector. The goal is to check in the CDF peak the presence, if any, of a spin-flip component due to magnetic excitations. We will therefore figure out if CDF are only made of charge, as commonly believed, or if they are characterized by a mixed spin-charge character. Ultimately, we can identify which is the driving force behind the unconventional phenomenology of the strange metal, a needed prerequisite to properly model this mysterious phase of the matter.","516":"IHR","517":"Hydroxyapatites (HA) are versatile materials that can substitute any of their basic units by ionic species possessing similar characteristics while maintaining their structural entity. Commonly, a cationic exchange at a superficial level is performed by substituting the Ca2+ by a similar metal cation (M2+). The substitution of the Ca2+ by Cu2+ ions is particularly interesting, due to the versatility of Cu in many different applicative fields, including heterogeneous catalysis. Yet, the knowledge of the nature of the Cu substituents at a molecular level is still scarce. Driven by encouraging findings about the red-ox activity of Cu-HA, we propose to study by in situ XAS a batch of Cu-HA with a Cu loading of 2-7 wt. % and high surface area.

Because the grains will be small (1\u221210 \u03bcm, slightly larger than is typically desirable for resolvability), we require scanning 3DXRD, which has a higher spatial resolution than conventional 3DXRD dictated by the beam cross-section (150\u2212200 nm^2).

This proposal encompasses the investigation of new classes of small molecules that target difficult proteins and non-typical binding sites. This includes the development of supramolecular compounds or cyclic peptides to address \u201cnon-druggable\" proteins. The main collaborative research fields are tackling Ras protein signaling with structure-guided ligand design, developing inhibitors of the Ras-binding protein PDEd, screening of a novel sp3-enriched fragment library or targeting genetic regulators. Cellular signaling will also be addressed through the structural analysis of deubiquitinating enzymes or regulators of the kinetochore. Finally, we plan to crystallize membrane proteins including GPCRs in order to understand their biological function, characterize their ligand specificity and develop novel regulators.","594":"This project aims to understand, within a logic of power-to-gas, the corrosion mechanism of metallic components used for the natural gas network in the perspective of hydrogen storage. The presence of hydrogenothrophic microorganisms (methanogens) in natural gas deposits, where electrochemically produced hydrogen is stored, can strongly affect both the fuel stability and the degradation rate of metallic pipelines, leading to strong economic losses. This corrosion mechanism is strongly related to the methanogenesis process, which is still not well documented. With the proposed experiment we intend to evaluate the oxidative states and degree of crystallinity of corrosion products formed on the surface of four alloys (carbon steel, duplex stainless steel, electrolytic copper and duplex brass), exposed to both a methanogens-rich solution (from a biogas plant) and a sterile condition to elucidate on the methanogenesis\/corrosion mechanism and to evaluate the severity of the corrosive attack.","595":"The in-situ determination of a material\u2019s elastic tensor at high pressure is of the highest importance for numerous fields of research, namely materials science, condensed matter physics, and geophysics where it is the cornerstone of seismology. As it stands, no method exists to obtain this information from highly heterogeneous and opaque samples. In this innovative proposal, we aim to combine two new, but well-established and highly synergistic approaches\u2014X-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction of polycrystals (SC-XRDp)\u2014that together enable the full elastic tensor determination of high-pressure high-temperature in-situ synthesized polycrystals, irrespectively of their transparency or chemical heterogeneity. This novel methodology will be demonstrated on: bridgmanite (MgSiO3) and two phases of Fe2O3, the perovskite and post-perovskite phases.

The bonding is performed\r\nusing thin silicon layer deposits on the surfaces of SiC. We have demonstrated by ex-situ experiments that a series of transitions occur,\r\nincluding melting and dewetting of the confined silicon film at temperatures around the silicon melting melting temperature (Tm=1410\u00b0C)\r\nThe evolution will be studied using interface reflectivity at medium\/high x-ray energy (30keV) and interface scattering. We shall measure the\r\nsealing of the gap and the broadening of the interfaces. Crystal scattering will be also followed to monitor the strain in the layers close to the\r\ninterface.","599":"Mo\/ZSM-5 has been widely studied in literature for methane dehydroaromatization. However, the Mo\/ZSM-5 catalyst deactivates quickly due to surface coke formation and the formation of MoCx particles during the reaction. Alternative transition metals such as W, V, Cr, and Fe that have been proven their ability to convert methane into aromatics are being studied to gain a better understanding of their function. In this study, we want to establish structure-performance relationships of  W\/ZSM-5 during the MDA process. This catalyst can achieve similar benzene yields as Mo\/ZSM-5, but there is a knowledge gap on the structural evolution of W\/ZSM-5 during both the activation of the catalyst and the reaction itself. This operando HERFD XANES\/XES study will yield essential information on the evolution of the W sites under reaction conditions. Combining these results with online catalytic performance measurements will gain new insights in the field of methane conversion into valuable compounds.","601":"For the first time, the Spanish Macromolecular Structural Groups in Granada, Almeria and Valencia present a joint proposal to form a strong core of scientists devoted to deciphering the structure and molecular mechanisms of proteins and protein complexes of biomedical and biotechnological interest. The objectives of this new proposal range from deciphering the molecular basis of human pathologies and developing targeted therapies to designing new protein catalysts. Following the advice of the ESRF evaluation committee, this proposal will merge two Teams with a long trajectory in protein crystallography and synchrotron usage, the Oriental Andalusian Team (Mx2454) led by JA Gavira and the Valencian Team with (Mx2452) led by S Ram\u00f3n-Maiques. This is an excellent opportunity to reinforce the crystallography teams and better use synchrotron resources.","602":"Sodium-ion batteries are the most promising alternative to lithium-ion battery technology, highly needed to meet the always growing demand for energy storage capability. The development of highly performing cathodes is the crucial step for their commercialization. Layered oxides with formula Nax(Mn\/TM)O2 (TM Transition metal ions; 0<x<1.5) are the most appealing due to their suitable potential and high theoretical capacity. Their phase diagram is highly complicated due to the presence of several phase transitions among layered structures driven by the sodium content, Mn\/TM ratio, and temperature. Despite the small changes in composition, the actual crystal structure is crucial in determining the electrochemical performance.\r\nHere we propose to investigate the structural evolution of the series NaxMn0.5Ni0.5O2 with 0.7<x<1.1 through in-situ high-temperature diffraction analysis (500\u00b0-1000\u00b0C range, where phase transitions have been reported for similar compositions) at ID22\r\n","604":"Understanding the processes leading to fossilization is crucial in palaeontology and laboratory-based experiments are an effective approach to constrain their timing, controls and mechanisms. Experiments of arthropods pyritization, one of the main pathways of replication of organisms in the fossil record, were conducted. The goal of this proposal is to visualize in 3D both the organism decay and its preservation by pyrite precipitation, which has not been possible with laboratory-based X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Data will (i) bring clues to the debate on whether tissues influence pyrite precipitation, (ii) establish a precise sequence of character decay in Crustacean, and (iii) precise the kinetics and influence of environmental factors onto ongoing destructive and preservation processes.","605":"Springback is defined as the behavior of the material when unloading the stress applied to it; if this behavior is linear, it is well understood and easily predictable because it is governed by classical elasticity. On the other hand, and this is the subject of our study, a non-linear unloading behavior is observed during the stamping of sheets for example and the mechanisms responsible for this behavior are poorly understood and controversial. Although many authors have observed nonlinear springback, paradoxically, few have observed it at fine scales and the hypotheses are numerous. Some authors attribute it to second-order elasticity, others to residual stress heterogeneities, fracture mechanisms, textural softening induced by deformation, detwinning,  but there is currently no direct evidence of this phenomenon.","606":"Magnetic moment determination of this multilayer structures","607":"Several peptides and proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyloid-beta in Alzheimer\u2019s or alpha-synuclein in Parkinson\u2019s disease are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) and can bind Cu to form Cu-IDP complexes. These Cu-IDP are able to catalyse the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of a reducing agent (ascorbate) and dioxygen. This ROS production needs the redox cycling between the two redox states (Cu(I), Cu(II)) and is thought to contribute to the neurodegeneration.\r\nIn the proposed project we propose to perform variable temperature XAS measurements in which we photoreduce Cu and then perform XAS experiments at different cryogenic temperatures in order to capture and characterize the intermediate redox states of Cu-Amyloid \u03b2 and Cu-alpha-synuclein.\r\n","608":"The Finnish BAG encompasses 24 groups active in crystallography in Finland.

Samples will be measured in an in-situ cell, available at ESRF from the sample environment laboratory (microtomo) upon reducing (He\/CO 5%) and oxidizing reaction (He\/O2 20%) at different temperature raging from RT to 973 K\r\nThis will allow gaining direct observation of the impact of the Gd dopant in the ceria and in its Oxygen Storage Capacity and on the bulk concentration of Ce3+.","612":"The idea is to show feasibility and built procedure to perform such experiments","613":"Pt catalysts are still the only practical cathode material in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) despite their limited long-term stability, which results from irreversible surface restructuring and Pt dissolution upon oxidation\/reduction. Understanding these processes is mandatory for increasing the lifetime. Our previous studies on Pt(111) and Pt(100) revealed the mechanism by which Pt atoms are extracted from the surface during the initial stages of oxidation. However, the relationship between the electrochemical charge transfer that is required for the formation of surface oxide species and restructuring of the Pt surface is still unknown. We here propose to disentangle these processes by systematic studies of the oxidation\/reduction kinetics on Pt(111) and Pt(100) on the millisecond time scale. In these studies, we will monitor the Pt extraction and charge transfer by operando high energy X-ray surface diffraction (HESXRD) and simultaneous electrochemical measurements.","614":"We aim at determining the 3D structure of IgM core by cryoEM and advanced image processing","615":"Fast access beamtime","616":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), i.e. high blood pressure in the lung, is a lethal condition. Novel therapies have shown promising pressure-lowering results, but their exact effects are unknown. In particular, one of the new drugs has been observed to induce symptoms similar to the ones of a genetic \r\ndisorder, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Patients with HHT can develop larger connections (shunts) between arteries and veins in the lung. If the same happens in PAH patients treated with the drugs, intrapulmonary shunts could explain the pressure-lowering effect; however, they might also dangerously lower the oxygen level if they become significant. Our goal is to map the microscopic 3D effects of two novel PAH therapies (in rat models), and to compare their effects with the vascular changes seen in human HHT and mouse models of HHT. Our results will lead to a better understanding of these novel PAH drugs, which is of great importance for the safety of patients.","617":"scanning X-ray microdiffraction on human iPS cell-derived neural spheres","618":"In-house high throughput measurement","622":"Thanks to the progress in 2D materials technology, van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibiting intriguing long-range magnetic order can be synthesized by epitaxial methods down to the monolayer. Substrate choice is crucial as it influences 2D magnetic order of the layer, making it difficult or helpful the achievement of desired properties. Our preliminary XAS\/XMCD studies on epitaxial chromium trichloride, CrCl3, monolayers (MLs) grown by MBE on Au(111) showed that these MLs are intrinsically ferromagnetic at low temperature, however no magnetic crystalline anisotropy was observed. We propose to perform in situ XMCD measurements of CrCl3 MLs grown on single-layer graphene, which in turn is grown on either magnetic or non-magnetic substrates. We aim to prove the ability of the substrate in tuning the magnetic properties of vdW magnetic materials through proximity-induced phenomena.","623":"Iridium is one of the most incompressible element within the family of 5d metals and it is the only refractory metal with a face-centred cubic structure. It has a number of exceptional properties, such as: high shear modulus, chemical inertness, high thermal and phase stability. For these reasons it is a very good candidate as gasket material or as pressure standard for high temperature and high pressure diamond-anvil cell experiments. However, the stability of its fcc structure under pressure has been debated for years and so far there is not experimental evidences of its melting curve. Therefore, we propose to perform a thorough investigation of the P-T phase diagram of iridium up to 180 GPa and 1300 K combining resistively-heated DAC (RH-DAC) and x-ray diffraction techniques. In this way we will be able to point out any possible solid-solid phase transition or anomalies linked to a predicted core-level crossing electronic transition and,extract its PVT equation of state.","625":"The transition towards sustainable, plant-based protein sources for food systems requires knowledge on how plant-based proteins interact with food-relevant microstructures. In particular, in the formulation of aerated food systems (e.g. foams), the mechanism by which plant-based proteins stabilise the interfaces is considerably different than that of traditional animal-based protein. This proposal aims to investigate the in situ structures and formation dynamics of plant-based proteins at the air-water interface, using grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The structural information provided by GISAXS forms the missing link between (in house) state of the art interfacial rheology and high resolution but ex situ and static atomic force microscopy (AFM). The experiment will provide a major step forward towards a general understanding of the interfacial stabilisation mechanisms of plant-based proteins.","626":"In the proposed experiment we will investigate the structural aspects of dynamic deformation of Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses under laser shock loading. To this\r\nend, a mid- power density laser with a nanoseconds pulse duration will be used to generate a shock wave and the local atomic arrangement of the glassy sample will be probed during its propagation by time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy for Cu K-edge. By quantitative analysis of the EXAFS spectra we\r\nwill evaluate the parameters of local atomic environment of Cu atoms during shock compression. These results will help us to elucidate the structural origin of the experimentally observed anomalies in the pressure dependence of the sound\/shock wave velocity in Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses and identify a possible underlying pressure-induced structural transition in the amorphous phase.","627":"The fabrication of performant rare-earth free permanent magnets (PM) using single crystalline Co nanorods (NRs) requires to control the formation of dense and parallel assemblies from a colloidal suspension. These assemblies results from a complex 3-steps dynamic process occurring with very different time-scales : i) the NR alignment under an external field (ms), ii) their migration toward zones of high field gradient (s) and iii) their densification during the drying step (min). In operando studies coupling USAXS, SAXS and WAXS will allow to follow in real time the migration and the densification of Co NRs under magnetic field at the characteristic length of the NR crystallites (\u00c5), interparticle distance (10\u2019s - 100\u2019s of nm) and of the pre-aligned fibers (\u00b5m). The impact of the experimental parameters (solvent, concentration, magnetic field) on the orientation distribution function will allow guiding the fabrication of rare-earth free PM with enhanced properties.","629":"Vineyard soils are contaminated with copper (Cu) due to the use of Cu-based fungicides, even in organic viticulture. Phytoremediation can represent an alternative to extract part of Cu from these soils. After a screening of local plants in a vineyard, two plant species with high level of Cu in their aerial parts have been identified. The objective of this proposal is to focus on plants collected on the site to identify the mechanisms involved in Cu accumulation. For that, Cu chemical imaging by micro X-ray fluorescence (\u00b5XRF), and Cu speciation by micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (\u00b5XANES) will be combined. This information will be essential to determine the strategy developed by the plant to cope with Cu toxicity.","630":"This study focuses on Histatins, a family of saliva proteins that act as a first line of defence of our innate immune system and possess antiviral\/antimicrobial\/antifungal properties.

This\r\nstudy aims to understand why Hst5 has a greater killing efficacy for fungi and microbes and less for Influenza Virus A, while the opposite relationship prevails for Hst1 and Hst3. We will learn about the distribution of oligomers\/complexes, their structure, size, and shape, and the intra-complex\/oligomers' distances. We aim to understand what differs in the interaction between Hst1\/Hst3\/Hst5 and how their structure relates to their function. Computer simulations will give us atomistic insight, which is impossible through experiments. ","632":"During crystallisation, a small proportion of diamonds (no more than 2%), captures tiny inclusions of other minerals. These mineral inclusions sometimes derive from great depths and are our only window into the Earth\u2019s transition zone (410-660 km) and the lower mantle (660-2900 km), regions of our planet, impossible to sample directly. \r\nHere we propose to implement the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (beamline ID14) in order to measure Fe3+\/Fe2+ in the mineral inclusions (ferropericlase, Ca-perovskite, majoritic garnet) within two large diamonds and also in separate 10 majoritic garnets, all from Juina, Brazil. The second aim of this proposal is to use these data for devising an oxygen barometer for the deep mantle, that currently does not exist.\r\nThis will have important implications to the mantle rheology and transport properties as well as to mantle convection and material circulation between the upper and lower mantle. \r\n","635":"The piezoelectric coefficient for semiconductor nanowires (NWs) was suggested to show a non-linear increase with decreasing NW diameter making them promising candidates for future mechanical energy transducers. However, very few experimental works on the piezoelectricity of NWs exist due to the tiny extensions induced in nanostructures by piezoelectricity which are difficult to be quantified by techniques like piezo force microscopy. On the contrary, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is highly sensible to lattice deformations, thus facilitating to measure the piezoelectrically-induced strain and, hence provide absolute values of the piezoelectric coefficients of nanomaterials. This proposal focuses on the piezoelectric properties of single suspended ZnO NWs studied by in situ XRD while applying external electric fields.","636":"Exploring infinite-layer nickelate properties is a topic of current interest. Our initial measurements unveiled strain-induced XAS dichroism, indicating significant electronic structure modification. We propose to perform Ni L3-edge RIXS on free-standing, strained nickelate membranes to investigate orbital, magnon, and phonon evolution. These findings will deepen our understanding of nickelate electronic structure and serve as a milestone for RIXS studies on strained quantum material membranes.","637":"Rock failure by dynamic unloading is a common mechanical process in the Earth\u2019s crust (earthquakes, underground rock mass excavation) but has been little studied experimentally due to technical challenges. We conceived new experiments deforming water-saturated rocks under virtually instantaneous decompression after being loaded at high pressures and temperatures. Preliminary lab-based X-ray CT suggest that the induced dynamic fracturing is positively correlated with the pressure drops but it is dramatically enhanced when the pore water vaporises\/degasses during decompression. Such phase transitions might play a big, so far neglected, role in sustaining the initial stages of dynamic fracturing in the crust. To assess the magnitude of these processes, it is vital to fully quantify the 3D fracture network of the experimental samples to submicrometric resolution through synchrotron-light X-ray microtomography. These unique data can help to close a current knowledge gap in rock mechanics.","638":" The Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) provides Macromolecular Crystallography support to our CAT members from eight Universities in the USA, including Northwestern University, University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Michigan State University, University Wisconsin, Vanderbilt University, and University of Illinois at Chicago, and also to General Users.

We will also study the stability of perovskite solar cells under differnet conditions. We will use a special environmental chamber to get information about the structure evolution and under different external conditions, including temperature, UV presence and atmosphere for in-situ measurements.

We are currently doing detailed first-principle calculations in oxychloride cuprates, including techniques that explicitly incorporate the electron-electron interactions and that are particularly well suited for our case. We will complete our study of paramagnons in oxychlorides, at the highest doping, in order to maximize the effect of the mobile charges on the magnetic excitation, as well as very low doping, in the pure pseudo-gap phase, in order to compare the results with our calculations.","645":"Insect wings are remarkably stable lightweight structures that endure the loads of millions of flapping cycles during flight. The insect wings are built of cuticle, a biological composite material of proteins and embedded reinforcing chitin fibers. A wing is structured as a thin cuticular membrane reinforced by tube-shaped longitudinal and cross veins, which subdivide the wing membrane into polygonal so-called cells. Previous experiments using scanning X-ray micro- and nanodiffraction focused on the distribution and orientation of chitin nanofibers in unloaded wing sections. In the membrane, the chitin fibers were oriented longitudinally far from the veins and, surprisingly, perpendicular to the veins in their vicinity. From these results we propose a specific reinforcement of the wing cells to the tensile loads acting on them during flapping flight. In the proposed experiments, this hypothesis will be tested by stretching different sections of a wing in situ under load control.","646":"We aim to generate a baseline fundamental description of high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants, with a particular emphasis on the intra- and inter-granular phase and amorphous distribution during sintering and recrystallization.

Heating is seen as the dominant modification process in all processing of regolith: 3D printed constructions, separation of oxygen and metal, and the extraction of volatiles are application areas to be developed.

These sediments constitute the habitats for several ecosystems (i.e. coral reef) and are endangered by ocean acidification; thus representing an urgent and relevant iissue. The Mg\/Ca ratio is an established temperature proxy for climate reconstructions. At the macro-scale, the growth reveals a banding pattern, with fluctuations in Mg\/Ca related to seasonal fluctuation; at the micro-scale, the skeletal parts show specific ultrastructures (i.e. in the different calcified layers in the cell walls). It is still not clear how biomineralization and Mg incorporation take place.

We expect some BAG members to resume using ESRF after utilizing other facilities.  As much as we appreciate the immense capacities of ESRF, the majority of BAG members are discontent (to say the least) regarding the post-shutdown\/Covid-19 travel regulations imposed by the management.  It seems that bureaucracy rather than common sense is prevailing and an accompanying letter will be submitted adjoined to the proposal\/report.

","659":"The high-Tc cuprate superconductors feature a complex phase diagram involving various ordering phenomena besides superconductivity, such as charge and spin density waves. It has been widely suggested that antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, surviving upon doping the AFM Mott insulator parent compounds, play a key role in the cooper pairing mechanism and the formation of charge density waves in these materials. Our group recently succeeded in growing high quality thin films of La2-xCaxCuO4 (LCCO) in the overdoped regime with dopings up to x = 0.5 and observed that superconductivity as well as charge ordering surprisingly persists up to at least x = 0.5. Here, we propose to carry out Cu-L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on LCCO thin films to systematically investigate the evolution of dispersive magnetic excitations in the overdoped regime. The aim is to understand the extent to which AFM fluctuations determine the superconducting and charge density wave phase boundaries.","660":"Previous work using diffraction has shown that the nanocrystal c-lattice parameter in mouse bones can vary due to stresses induced by shrinkage or expansion of collagen in the nanocomposite. Here we propose to use diffraction mapping to examine the effects of dehydration on nanocrystal deformation in different bone tissue types of healing bone, namely callus and cortical bone tissues. The c lattice parameter will be determined in relation to bone healing sites to assess the effects of changes to the levels of mineralization in murine bone samples. By measuring lattice constants before and after exposure to collagen-destroying radiation, residual strain distributions will be determined. Results will help us understand the role and emerence of residual strains in the natural tissue and to asses to what extent, tissue healing modulates these strains.","662":"This research proposes to employ advanced X-ray diffraction microtomography and x-ray microtomography to investigate the effects induced by combined ammonium oxalate (AmOx) and ammonium phosphate (DAP) treatments in the conservation of carbonate stones in Cultural Heritage.

This project aims to explore the dehydration in an in-situ experiment at the U M4-edge by measuring the HERFD-XAS at intermediate temperature points from room temperature to 800 oC where the transition goes [UO2(O2)(H2O)2] to U2O7 to UO3, but no in-situ experiments have been conducted to look for intermediate phases. In addition at structural changes we will measure the v2C XES spectra for a full description on the electronic structure. This work will give more detailed information on the decomposition and structural phases observed in this important material and add to safety cases for both short and long term storage of uranium in waste nuclear fuel cycles.","667":"The emerging class of metal-organic framework glasses (MOF glasses) holds promise for achieving high proton conductivity due to their disordered structure, which enhances proton mobility. However, designing the properties of MOF glasses remains challenging because they are mostly prepared using top-down approaches, and only a few selected MOFs show a stable liquid state while most of them decompose upon heating. Moreover, proton-conductive MOF glasses, to date, are not water-stable, which limits their applications. Here we propose an entirely novel bottom-up strategy to synthesize tailored Zr-MOF glasses for achieving proton conductivity and water stability. The MOF glasses were synthesized by crosslinking Zr-clusters, leveraging modular building blocks such as pre-designed functional linkers, precise control over local geometry, and post-synthesis modifications to achieve proton conductivity, thermal stability, processability, and water stability.","668":"The dosage of pharmaceuticals produced in non-crystalline phases, such as nanoparticles or glasses, has a great advantage due to their better bioavailability and solubility than crystalline counterparts. The modification of pharmaceutical by mechanical perturbation, e.g., milling or compaction, may lead to the desired amorphization of the structure that resembles the structure of glass produced by the standard vitrification. However, mechanically-stressed pharmaceuticals often exhibit distinct functional properties from ordinary glasses. The origin of these differences can be traced to the structure at the atomic and supramolecular levels. In this project, we are going to reveal the nature of the structural disorder introduced by milling and pressurization for selected active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The pair distribution function (PDF) is nowadays one of the most powerful tools to study the local structure and will be applied in this context for the amorphized APIs.","669":"This necessitates the localized probes to comprehensively investigate the structural and chemical evolution of electrodes during battery cycling, revealing how the complex interplay among void formation, interphase growth affects battery properties, such as cycle life and safety. Herein, we propose to combine hard x-ray phase contrast nano-tomography and advanced machine learning approaches to systematically investigate the morphological and chemical behaviours at doped High-Nickel and Low-Cobalt cathodes interphases that are subjected to different cycling protocols. By characterizing the electrode with high spatial resolution and associating with the chemomechanical reactivity and morphological deformation of hundreds to thousands of identified active doped High-Nickel and Low-Cobalt cathodes  particles, we aim to develop a theoretical inter- and intra- particle model that could predict the mechanical failure in the high-Ni and low-Co cathode.  \r\n","670":"Novel materials for metal\/semiconductor contacts such as Sc and Mo have shown great promise to achieve record low contact resistivity values. However, a detailed study of the structural properties of the corresponding metal silicides has not been conducted and is essential to enable further improvements in contact resistivity. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the silicidation of Sc and Mo, deposited on highly doped epitaxial source\/drain (S\/D) layers, when subjected to post-metal annealing (PMA) treatments.The resulting (poly)crystallinity, and in particular the texture, of the metal (silicide) will be investigated by conducting in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) pole figure measurements.","671":"Portland cement generates about 0.8 tons of CO2 per cement ton, which contributes to ~7% of total CO2 emissions. Cements with a low-CO2 footprint include Fe-rich (or Ca2FeAlO5-rich or in cement notation C4AF-rich) cement manufactured using industrial wastes such as iron slags, which reduce cement clinkering temperature and the amount of limestone (CaCO3) used. However, the synthesis procedure, including the sintering temperature, heating, and cooling rate affects the structure of C4AF. Furthermore, industrial wastes contain a range of minor elements that may affect the C4AF reactivity. In this work, we propose to investigate the formation and atomic structure evolution upon heating and cooling of C4AF as well as the effects of dopant elements (Zn and Mn) through in-situ X-ray diffraction and total scattering experiments. This study's results will help identify suitable iron slags and synthesis procedures for producing iron-rich low CO2 cement.","672":"We want to test a film of Ti3C2 as electrocatalyzer at potentials close to the hydrogen evolution reaction.

The aim of this proposal is to clarify the relationship between superconductivity and this structural transition by performing an XRD study of La\u00ac 327 powder under pressure and from 300K down to 5K to check the crystal structure of the superconducting phase. The use of a better hydrostatic PTM (neon or helium) than in the previous studies (oil or solid media) will allow an accurate determination of the full P,T phase diagram.","674":"High Throughput inhouse samples","675":"Foraminifers are ubiquitous marine microplankton with calcareous shells, which are important for the global carbon cycle and provide one of the most important archives for paleoclimate reconstruction. Interpretation of the shell\u2019s isotopic and trace elemental composition provides a window into environmental conditions in the geological past, although a mechanistic understanding of how these signals are recorded in the biomineral is lacking. To better constrain both biomineralisation and alteration processes during fossilisation, we will conduct high-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses to investigate the distribution of organic matter in the shell, and hence its relevance at the biomineralisation site and during taphonomic processes. By contributing to the understanding of foraminifer biomineralisation, these insights will provide crucial information to understand the reliability of the large number of geochemical tools that are based on the shells of these organisms.","676":"scanning XRF analysis of scorpion stingers","677":"A series of isostructural magnetic coordination polymers {[MII(pyrazole)4]2[NbIV(CN)8].4H2O}n (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively) show long-range magnetic ordering below 24, 8, 6 and 13 K due to the strong magnetic coupling between M and Nb. The exchange coupling changes from -6.8 for 1, through -3.1 for 2, +3.5 for 3 to +8.1 cm-1 for 4. This affects the nature of the long-range magnetic ordering in the 1-4 series: ferrimagnetic in 1 and 2 with antiparallael alignment of the Mn-Nb and Fe-Nb magnetic moments to ferromagnetic in 3 and 4 with parallel alignment. The proposed XAS\/XMCD experiments performed at the Nb L2,3 edges with the application of sum rules are the only reliable way to unequivocally determine the magnetic structure of the four compounds. Moreover, compound 3 demonstrates switching of the type of long-range magnetic ordering under pressure. This will also be investigated by collecting XAS\/XMCD spectra at the Nb L2,3 edge under high pressure.","678":"Catalytic hydrodechlorination is a useful technique to upgrade chloromethanes due to its mild operation conditions. Our previous kinetic experiments revealed that the introduction of Ag to the Al2O3-supported Pt catalyst resulted in a significant enhancement of both the catalytic activity and the selectivity towards CH2Cl2 during CHCl3 hydrodechlorination. This proposal aims to utilize in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the coordination environments and electronic properties of both Pt and Ag at different reaction temperatures and times in real reaction conditions. The objective is to identify the active sites of the PtAg\/Al2O3 catalyst and clarify the synergistic effect of Pt and Ag in enabling the improvement of catalytic activity and high selectivity towards CH2Cl2 in the CHCl3 hydrodechlorination reaction.","679":"The ESRF has been asked to help for the preparation of the restoration of the old violin called the \"Cannone\" that was played by Paganini in the late 18th century. This invaluable violin needs to be repaired, but due to the extent of degradations, and considering that it is still played regularly, a very detailed assessment of its present state is required. BM18 with its hierarchical propagation phase contrast microtomography capabilities with low dose setup is currently the best location in the world to conduct this study. Nevertheless, considering the importance of this violin, a dry run with another less valuable violin, as well as a modern copy of the Cannone is required to test all the protocols, including the control of the humidity and dosimetry. This proposal hence covers both the dry run on the two test violins and the real experiment. It is performed on directors contingency beamtime.","680":"In oncological head and neck surgery, microvascular free fibula flaps have become the gold standard in bony reconstruction, especially for the mandible. Still, contradictory data on the ossification in the gap region between the local bone (Alveolar bone = AB) and the transplanted bone (Fibula bone = FB) exists. Besides individual parameters like patient anatomy, mechanical integrity, and the postoperative load, the role of the bone 3D osteocyte network (OCN) topology at the AB-FB interface have not been examined yet. Since the OCN plays a fundamental role in cell\u2013cell contact, nutrition, signaling, and even in bone remodeling, we plan to examine the OCN topology in and adjacent to the gap region with nanoCT on ID16B. These results will help visualize the inter-connections of newly formed bone tissue, and help understand to what extent the integration of the transplanted bone occurs via the OCN as opposed to the blood vessel system through osteoblast\/osteoclast activity. ","681":"To make polycrystalline silicon solar cell technology cheaper, we need to solve two main challenges, A) Understand the movement dynamics of charge carriers through the grain boundaries and B) Reduce the effect of increasing temperature on efficiencies. Scanning 3DXRD with its developments in recent years has shown to be a reliable technique to study grain boundaries in 3D. In this experimental proposal, we want to map the p-n junction boundary of a polycrystalline silicon solar cell and understand how it changes as a function of misorientation between grains which lie along the p-n junction and temperature.","682":"Catalyzed autogenic pressure carbonization (APC) is a safe treatment for upcycling non-recyclable single-use plastic into anodes for alkali-ion batteries. The carbonization mechanism of plastic waste treated by catalyzed APC has been scarcely explored and no reports are available concerning the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) technique. It has been shown that the catalyzed APC of polyethylene bags and polystyrene cups leads to paramagnetic, conducting pure carbon microspheres with various morphologies and compositions. In this project, we aim to study in situ the real-time carbonization of common plastic waste (e.g., cigarette filters) to highlight differences in phase, composition, interlayer spacing, porosity, defectivity, and microscopic texture before, during, and after the thermal conversion, and to clarify the mechanism as a function of plastic type, carbonization temperature and residence time using the WAXS technique and coupling it with the pair distribution function.\r\n","683":"High Throughput samples","684":"XNH of user experiments","685":"This LTP is motivated by systematic studies on ammonia synthesis catalysts under the realistic conditions of the Haber-Bosch process, as employed for the production of sustainable renewable ammonia at offshore wind power plants.

","688":"The two primary goals of this proposal are: demonstrating X-ray tensor tomography (XTT) with speckle-based imaging for the first time and investigating the unknown sub-micron 3D structure of auditory ossicles within the human middle ear at the macro-scale. XTT allows for the 3D visualisation of X-ray scattering (dark field) from features smaller than the resolution of the imaging system and enables the quantitative detection of the orientation of anisotropic structures within the sample. While the method has successfully been demonstrated using gratings, speckle-based XTT has not been achieved to date. We will apply the novel speckle TT method to the investigation of the main orientation of microstructures within healthy and pathological human middle-ear ossicles. The inner structure of ossicles is largely unknown and further knowledge would be an important step towards a better understanding of hearing loss and the planning and assessment of reconstructive ossicle surgery.","689":"This proposal requests beam time for exploratory rheometry experiments on ultralow-viscosity, hydrous basanite magma.  This type of magma has only been rarely observed to erupt from volcanoes, however, the 2021-2022 eruption of basanite from Tajogaite on the island of La Palma (Castro and Feisel, 2022) marks the most recent and destructive event of its kind in Europe.  This project aims  to mesure the viscosity of hydrous basanite melts.

However, it remains unclear whether bipedalism occurred because it conveyed an adaptive advantage over quadrupedal locomotion or that it may have simply resulted as a biomechanical consequence of higher acceleration, or if it was the result of multiple factors. The oldest taxa hypothesized to have employed bipedalism date back to the early Permian, including Eudibamus cursoris and Cabarzia trostheidei. Nonetheless, interpretations regarding the bipedal aptitude of these species have primarily leaned on rather subjective evidence, and this hypothesis has never been tested directly using rigorous biomechanical analyses. The current project thus aims at better understanding the morphofunctional abilities of these species, and to test the degree of their proposed bipedalism using innovative biomechanical analyses combined with paleohistological and ichnological data.","693":"The HeidelBAG unifies structural efforts of EMBL Heidelberg and the Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center (BZH).

In the following, we therefore propose XMCD measurements at the Ir L edge at the beam line ID12 on a selection of high quality SIO\/LCO heterostructures to study the Ir magnetic moment as a function of the gate voltage Vg. Specifically, we aim to investigate the orbital and spin moment of Ir as well as possible changes in the density of unoccupied Ir 5d states as a function of Vg.","695":"The detection of crystal defect\/dislocation evolution is great significant to reveal the micromechanical properties of crystals.

These Ca, P-rich regions of interest correspond to the calcium phosphate minerals apatite and merrillite, which contain trace amounts (1-10 ppm) of REEs like Y and the lanthanide series (La-Lu). Quantified REE values normalised to early Solar System abundances reveal concentration trends which hint at which stage fluids started to mobilise on the water-rich parent bodies of these meteorites.","699":"This study aims to enhance our understanding of the formation of high-grade porphyry copper deposits, urged by the growing global demand of copper to support a sustainable transition to green energy.

In the case of technical applications of MICP, the durability of biocemented materials, such as sand, in aggressive environments must be evaluated. Exposure to weakly acidic waters, for example, triggers the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystals that bridge the sand grains and decreases the strength of the material. The mechanical properties of biocemented sand are linked to the contact properties due to the CaCO3 crystal bridges. Here, we aim to investigate the role of the different polymorphs and orientations of CaCO3 crystals on the evolution of the contact properties during dissolution. The possibility of coupling diffraction-tomography techniques will contribute to gaining complementary insights on the long-term assessment of the durability of biocemented sand in hostile environments.

While their existence is now firmly established, there is still much to discover about their spatial structure and their connection with breathing phonons. In particular, a recent paper has attributed the softening of these phonons to \u201cquasi-circular charge correlations\u201d instead of CDF. To address these questions, we will employ RIXS on YBCO films and analyze CDW, CDF and breathing phonons as a function of the azimuthal angle, spanning from the (H,0) to the (0,K) direction. This will enable us to track the spatial distribution of the CDF peak and determine which charge modulation is responsible for the softening of the breathing phonons. Ultimately, our findings will confirm whether CDF indeed drive the unconventional phenomenology of the strange metal phase.","712":"The experimental programme at beamline ID19 underwent tremendous changes in the more than 20 years of operation: starting from Bragg diffraction\r\ntopography (already with a substantial contribution of in situ experiments), the beamline pioneered hard X-ray phase contrast microtomography in routine user\r\napplication, later coupled with polychromatic illumination to exploit hard X-rays up to 250 keV as well as short exposure times.

We have recently discovered that DWs can be conductive also in narrow-gap materials with a strong charge-lattice coupling, such as the Mott insulator GaV4S8.

Our preliminary data indicates that these hydrophobic interactions are a key driver to NPs association with plant cuticle. In this project we propose to study how hydrophobicity and cuticle composition influence NPs transfers and transformations on and in tomato leaves. To do this, we aim at studying the interactions between (i) tomato mutants (cuticle composition and thickness variation) and (ii) Cu-based NPs of various hydrophobicities. Cu-based NP distribution and chemical speciation changes on the surface and inside leaves will be studied. Unravelling the role of cuticle composition and thickness on hydrophobic nanoparticle uptake will be an important step towards developing safe and sustainable agrochemicals.","737":"Calcium sulfate hemihydrate is one of the most consumed construction materials. In spite of its widespread use, its crystal structure remains a matter of debate. Two different types of hemihydrate, \u03b1 and \u03b2, are known. Their different reactivity has until now been related to their different microstructure, with the \u03b1- being more reactive (i.e., providing a faster setting). Recent research conducted at the ESRF has introduced the possibility that a single crystal may contain multiple structural domains. Here, we intend to analyze calcium sulfate hemihydrate samples from diverse sources, including industrial and commercial samples with known high reactivity. Our goal is to establish connections between crystal structure and reactivity, investigating whether variations are attributable to microstructural features like surface area or differences in atomic structure. The results from this experiment will be of high value for the development of materials with tunable reactivity.","738":"The overall objective is to develop a new method for 2D and 3D spectral computed tomography on synchrotron beamlines. Spectral or energy-resolved transmission imaging on beamlines is realized for example by collimating pencil synchrotron micro-beams. Generally, the energy resolution stems from crystal- or multi-layer mirrors positioned upstream of the object. Since every energy and pixel have to be scanned by consecutive motor steps these scans are extremely time consuming and their applicability to larger objects, i.e., higher energies like those on BM18 remains largely theoretical. With this project we propose to use pre-filtered high-energy polychromatic beams for single shot acquisition of spectral pixel lines. Our setup places refractive optics downstream of the object for mapping the polychromatic X-rays line wise onto spectral projections for the slice beam geometry of BM18 as well as algorithms and software for the visualization of the spectral data.","739":"NH3 is one of the most important chemical products but only made at 400-500 C and 150-300 bar conditions due to the stable N2 molecule. Here we have developed a Ru-CeO2 catalyst with high activity under 1-10 bar. Kinetic study reveals a H-assisted N2 dissociation mechanism, with a volcano-type activity dependence on the N2 activation barrier and the H2 adsorption strength. To validate such mechanism and volcano trends, we need to understand: 1) How the Ru d band centre determines the N2 activation behaviours; 2) Does the d band centre change along with reaction conditions; 3) How does N=NH* formed on Ru surface. Here we apply for an in situ Ru L3 edge vtc- RIXS study to follow the dynamics of Ru d band and identify Ru-N=NH under NH3 synthesis conditions. This study utilizes the uniqueness of the in situ tender RIXS capability at ID26. It is also a perfect synergy between in situ RIXS study and experimental kinetic models, which is the first of its kind for NH3 chemistry.","741":"In situ synchrotron diffraction study will be used to identify and track multiple phases in single crystals of the mixed perovskite PIN-PMN-PT as a function of electric field and external mechanical stress in dynamic mode. We we will exploit the unique capabilities of the BM28 beamline to perform X-ray dynamic diffraction in operando with a synchronized piezoelectric response and potential preparation for optical transmittance experiment which is critical to further the understanding of the ferroelectric phase transition and correlation to the dynamic domain re-configuration.

The data will be evaluated in conjunction with recent dynamic compression data to terapascal pressure. We will then investigate the effect of Si and C on the EOS of iron and possible formation of new compounds up to 365 GPa and 3500 K.

While developments are promising, SSBs still suffer from a range of problems limiting their utilisation. Problems largely originate from a chemo-mechanical degradation at buried interfaces upon cycling. Here, via the development of miniaturized SSBs (Li \u01c0 LiPON \u01c0 LiCoO2) and their examination using Operando Near-Field Ptychographic X-ray computed NanoTomography (NF-PXCT) we would like to further our understanding of these processes by imaging entire SSBs with nanometre resolution.","746":"This HOAHub will create a physical and virtual Hub which uses HiP-CT to scan whole human organs with local cellular resolution, producing a \u201cHuman Organ Atlas in Health and Disease\u201d.

The heartbeat depends critically on carefully regulated flows of calcium in the heart muscle cells. Heart failure is commonly associated with disturbances in the transport of calcium back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) storage after heart muscle contraction. This transport is carried out by ATP-dependent Ca2+-transporting proteins (SERCA) embedded in the SR membranes. A few SERCA-activating compounds have been developed, but suffer from lack of specificity. A major hurdle that prevents implementing activators in clinical usage, is that drug development currently is blind to the underlying molecular mechanism (including the transport kinetics) of SERCA activation. Therefore, we will use time-resolved X-ray solution scattering to determine which parts of the reaction cycle are affected by the drug and the associated time scales.","748":"The Rh-based catalysts have recently shown promising selectivity towards oxygenates like CH3OH and CH3CH2OH in COx (CO and CO2) hydrogenation.\r\n Via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), a powerful tool for the construction of well-defined model catalysts for an array of reactions, we have synthesized\r\n size-homogeneous Rh nanoparticles doped with different promoters on SiO2 (RhM@SiO2, M = Mn or Fe) to rationalize the effect of various metal promoters.\r\n By conducting ex-situ as well as in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments to identify the speciation of these bimetallic catalysts especially under\r\n working state, we hope to elucidate the nature of metal-promoter interaction for Rh-based catalyst and the active site for the formation of oxygenates (including\r\n methanol and ethanol). The outcomes of this proposal will enable to rational design the highly efficient catalysts for COx hydrogenation to oxygenates.","750":"Our lab. XRD indicates that rare earth Gd metal undergoes slightly Bragg peak broadening at low temperature, indicating a possible new phase at low temperature that has not been reported before. Our first-principles many-body calculations for the correlated 4f-shell of Gd predict that an orthorhombic phase could be stabilized by magneto-elastic forces due to ordering of Gd quadrupolar moments. Further high-resolution synchrotron XRD at ID22 is highly preferred to directly characterize the low-temperature structural distortion and reveal the low-symmetric structure. The determination of the true structure of pure Gd metal is important to further understand the nature of rare earth, such as electron structure, energy bands, phonons, and magnetism.","751":"Gas-phase CO adsorption over Pd catalysts","752":"The objective is to determine the (4x1) surface superstructure of an anatase-TiO2(001) film grown by PLD under UHV conditions. A similar experiment was already\r\nperformed on BM32 (2020013 experiment). The measured set of fractional rods, consisting of a set of seven reflections, was not sufficient to allow us to discriminate\r\nbetween the models found in the literature. We requested beam time to take a new data set in BM32 with new films presenting surface terraces 5 times (500 nm)\r\nlarger than those initially measured three years ago in 2020 in the same beamline (100 nm) [1]. The experiment will be used to compare these films with films\r\nprepared by MBE by enhancing the oxygen reactivity using an oxygen cracker during the growth process.","753":"This experiment proposal aims to address the challenges of residual stress analysis in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. The proposal suggests using the eigenstrain theory and strain tomography technique to achieve 3D reconstruction of residual stresses in complex-shaped, discontinuously processed LPBF parts. High-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements will be conducted on an AlSi7Mg spiral tower sample, enabling the quantification of elastic strains necessary for eigenstrain determination. By reconstructing eigenstrain distributions, this study intends to calculate residual stresses accurately, thus eliminating the need for expensive process simulations. This innovative approach promises valuable insights into residual stress distributions, deformations, and post-processing scenarios, opening new possibilities for LPBF optimization and design.","755":"Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, has a tightly packed crystalline structure stabilized by van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. This limits its solubility in most common solvents and its industrial applications. A better understanding of cellulose-solvent interactions is vital to improve the processability of cellulose. Inorganic molten salt hydrates such as ZnCl2 hydrates and LiSCN hydrates are a class of cellulose solvents that recently attracted increasing scientific attention due to their nontoxicity, low cost, and recyclability. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the crystal structure of cellulose\/ZnCl2 complex and the molecular interactions between cellulose and ZnCl2 hydrates using in-situ small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (S\/WAXS) technique. Such knowledge will lay a foundation for understanding and optimizing the swelling and dissolution of cellulose in molten salt hydrates for industrial applications.","757":"High Entropy Alloys are a promising new class of materials. Specifically, PtPdFeCoNi showed promising activites for ORR, making it a possible candidate for as a next-generation catalyst for PEMFCs. However, there is little known about the degradation of alloys, especially this HEA. Anomalous SAXS at the Pt K-edge and total scattering will be used to gain valuable insights in the dealloying process. From other operando measurments, we see a formation of an extra phase corresponding to a Pt-fcc. With ASAXS, we can confirm whether we have a core-shell nanoparticle forming and track its evolution over time. Total Scattering will allow us to track the dealloying on an atomic scale. These results will be essential to increase our understanding of alloys, especially HEAs","759":"Two-phase lithium alloy anodes are an emerging strategy to achieve industry performance targets in lithium solid-state batteries (SSBs) at minimal energy density penalty. However, the origins of how exactly they achieve this feat remain unclear, preventing their rational-driven development and practical implementation. First investigations, point to the spatial arrangement of the phases within the anode as well as local compositional and microstructural changes during cycling as performance determining. Using a combination of operando full-field X-ray phase-contrast tomography and scanning X-ray diffraction tomography, we will study the first cycle discharge process of two SSBs. One utilizing one of the most promising two-phase lithium alloy anodes, and another with pure lithium. Examination at this level of detail will allow us to identify fundamental relationships between microstructure and performance, accelerating the realization of high-performance room-temperature SSBs.","760":"Copper-based materials, known for CO hydrogenation, convert syngas (COx\/H2) to methanol. With \u03b3-Al2O3 as a dehydration catalyst, the methanol is further dehydrate into dimethyl ether. The introduction of cerium oxide as an electron promoter improves feed gas conversion efficiency. However, the electronic structure dynamics involving Ce species in the Cu-Zn\/\u03b3-Al2O3 system remain inadequately understood. This research aims to elucidate the effects of varied cerium loadings in xCe-10Cu5ZnO\/\u03b3-Al2O3 (x=0, 1, 3, 5, 7) on covalence changes and coordination numbers. Using Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), we will probe the electronic structure through XANES and EXAFS of the Ce-CuZnO\/\u03b3-Al2O3 system.

Energy and cost saving is much higher for turbine blisks, where the whole blisk needs to be replaced even if a single aerofoil is damaged.Thus, turbine blisk aerofoil repair is of great interest to aerospace industries from the perspective of reducing cost and increasing sustainability. Additive manufacturing (AM) has been used for repairing \u2018end of life\u2019 turbine blisk aerofoils. However, during repair, significant residual stresses arise due to large and repeated thermal gradients, which could lead to in-service failures.This precludes the use of the repaired parts in aircraft.

These lines of enquiry will address a major palaeontological question, namely, why theropod dinosaurs became the apex predators of the late Mesozoic, replacing other incumbent carnivorous lineages after the end-Triassic mass extinction. The material examined here represents the first theropod species from the Triassic of southern Africa. The uniqueness of these specimens, the difficulty in obtaining segmentable CT images, and the high resolutions required for digital osteohistology, require use of non-destructive synchrotron microtomography.

Iron, one of the three elements in the solid solution, is of particular interest as it is one of the abundant major elements in the mantle that may vary in oxidation and spin state with pressure and temperature. The high-pressure electronic properties, spin state, and phase stability of ferropericlase are critical to understanding the properties of and processes taking place in the mantle and have been subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies.

Here we propose a single cell SAXS study of targeting the sarcomeric contraction in different stages of the contractile cycle, taking advantage of our previous work on scanning diffraction, sample environments, and analysis [1-5]. To this end, we will combine high resolution in real space (2\u00b5m beam at ID13) with high resolution in reciprocal space (unfocused collimated beam, 30\u00b5m spot size at ID02). Isolated human and murine CMs will be probed at a single cell level, hydrated and chemically fixed, using single shot acquisition.

A key parameter is the superconducting properties of materials such as Ta, Sn with a critical temperature at 3.74K. One issue is that such materials undergo phase transition. For example, Sn undergoes a pase transition at 286K (13\u00b0C), from a body centred tetragonal phase Beta-Sn, to diamond cubic one inducing a huge volume increase of 27%, resulting in cracks of matter and in transformation into powder.\nIn the frame of this proposal, we will use the cryostat developped at BM02 to beamline to reach low temperature (6 K) to study the phase transition of such materials.","808":"The aim of this proposal is to provide user access to automated protein-to-structure and fragment screening pipelines based on the combination of EMBL HTX lab services and CrystalDirect technology and automated data collection at ESRF\u2019s MX beamlines.

In this study, we propose to investigate the iron oxidation state of silicate melts under metallic-iron saturated conditions, for the first time, reaching pressures and temperatures up to 135 GPa and 5500 K, respectively. The samples will be synthesized in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, simulating conditions corresponding to a deep magma ocean. Recovered samples, which exhibit micron-scale reacted areas, are then subjected to focused ion beam processing. The exposed quenched silicate melts will be analysed using nano-focused synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, allowing us to determine their Fe3+\/\u03a3Fe ratios.

The localized nature of the f-orbitals underpins the useful magnetic and electronic properties these applications rely on but also limits the electronic structural role of the lanthanide element. The application of pressure fundamentally changes this electronic structure signature of lanthanides as valence states become more delocalized. We propose to probe the orbital specific nature of these changes and transitions across a series of lanthanide molecules and materials using HERFD XAS. Elucidating the combined effect of mechanical and chemical factors will help deconvolute the interactions underpinning emergent behaviors such as magnetism. Developing such mechanochemical intuition promises improved design principles for synthesizing new magnetic materials.","811":"This BAG coordinates activities of groups from the South of the UK.

Since Cu is deemed to be the destabilizing element in this system, we focus on the reaction between CuO and the quaternary oxide (Mg,Co,Ni,Zn)O. A SEM analysis showed the formation of a product layer (Cu2MgO3-like) and a defective, less crystalline, diffusion layer. A high resolution XRD test proved to be effective in monitoring the structure (phases, distortion, cell parameter) across the interface, while producing the same compositions in powder form led to inconclusive results. As we observed from SEM a different distribution of elements, and even phases, ranging from short (up to 30 minutes) to long reaction times, we propose to investigate insitu the reaction of the DC at 1000\u00b0C. In comparison, we plan to investigate the DCs obtained by interrupting the reaction after a selected duration.","813":"Projects are focussed primarily within the framework of local collaborations on \"Ca2+signals: Molecular\r\nMechanisms und Integrative Functions\" at Saarland University and on natural bioactive compounds including their interactions with their target proteins with the Food Chemistry Department at Leibniz University in Hannover.

A key technique for generating quantum states with x-ray radiation involves parametric down-conversion. However, a significant challenge arises from the concurrent generation of significantly stronger Compton-scattered radiation that directly impacts the object, hindering the realization of typical benefits such as dose reduction and enhanced sensitivity associated with quantum radiation. In response to this challenge, we propose employing a mosaic crystal to effectively manage the broad spectrum of quantum states and filter out undesired Compton radiation. \r\nWe anticipate that the approach we will demonstrate will become the standard procedure for observing x-ray photon pairs. The success of this demonstration holds the potential to revolutionize the application of x-ray quantum states.","816":"We propose to study the magnetism and valence states of europium in the Zintl-type compounds EuMn2P2 and EuCuAs at high pressures up to 30 GPa by temperature and field-dependent 151Eu nuclear forward scattering at beamline ID 14 and the pressure dependence of their room temperature crystal structures at beamline ID15B up to 40 GPa. EuMn2P2 is a magnetic insulator with two magnetic elements. Surprisingly, the Mn sublattice does not develop long-range magnetic order. High-pressure transport studies indicate a transition to a metallic state above 5 GPa. In EuCuAs, the topological electronic states and properties could be tuned via the Eu spin structure, which is sensitive to magnetic fields. The proposed high-pressure synchrotron experiments, together with transport studies and electronic structure calculations, will allow us to elucidate the interplay between the covalent M-X and the ionic Eu sublattices in magnetic and topological Zintl-type europium compounds of recent interest.","817":"Study of Pt- and Fe-based catalysts for selective ammonia oxidation","818":"In situ ball milling of mixed copper(I) salts","820":" single crystal diffraction scans of bio-induced calcite crystals","821":"   Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many critical cellular processes. We have used laser-induced release from a caged, inactive form of ATP (NPE-caged) followed by short X-ray pulses at the dedicated time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) beamline ID09 at ESRF-EBS to study protein conformational change in real time. Because the NPE-caged ATP releases on a millisecond timescale, our studies have so far been blind to sub-millisecond structural intermediates. We now propose to use a different chemistry of the caged ATP (pHP-caged) that releases ATP in nanoseconds. We will track sub-millisecond domain movements and kinetics in calcium transport (skeletal-muscle SERCA1a and bacterial LMCA1) and in enzymatic energy conversion by adenylate kinase. The results will enable characterization of the faster events not characterized in solution for these proteins, can potentially revise earlier observations, and set a novel standard for TR-XSS experiments with caged compounds.","822":"We want to test a film of Ti3C2 as electrocatalyzer at potentials close to the hydrogen evolution reaction.

","824":"Boron carbide (B4C) is a superhard ceramic with applications in various industrial fields, including engineering tools, the nuclear industry, safety armors, and more. However, it exhibits a gradual loss of strength beyond its Hugoniot elastic limit, attributed to the formation of boron vacancies within the C-B-C chains along the c-axis under mechanical stress. To extend its plastic regime to higher constraints, the proposed approach is to strengthen the C-B-C chains that link the icosahedra of B4C. The objective is to substitute Boron atoms in the chains with Silicon using high pressure and high temperature (HP-HT). Thus, our aim is to investigate the HP-HT synthesis of Si-doped B4C phase, ensuring the absence of parasitic Si-C or Si-B compounds, through the direct reaction between molten Silicon and solid Boron carbide. This synthesis will be performed under HP-HT conditions where Silicon is liquid, preventing the formation of unwanted compounds.\r\n","825":"Within this study we investigate structural changes of SrCu2\u2062(BO3)2 with pressure with single crystal x-ray diffraction and diffuse x-ray diffraction.

The fossil record chronicles the survival of this genus before, through, and after the extinction, offering a unique opportunity to unravel its survival strategies. Many aspects of Lystrosaurus paleobiology have been studied, except the evolution of its brain size. The brain is an energy expensive organ, which puts a high selective pressure on it when resources become scarce; yet, it is also the seat of cognition, and may help to behaviourally adapt to a rapidly changing environment. As such, brain size may decrease or increase depending on the evolutionary response to mass extinction events. Documenting variations of the brain size in Lystrosaurus through the end-Permian mass extinction will shed new light on the evolutionary response of the central nervous system to high stress conditions, and how these dramatic events have shaped the mammalian brain.\r\n","830":"Copper-based catalysts play a crucial role in many catalytic reactions ranging from biological electron-transfer process to electrosynthesis of chemicals. A prominent example is the utilization of Cu single atoms coordinated with nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-N-C) materials in electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3-RR). Investigating the potential-dependent dynamic evolution of electronic structure of Cu center is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of its adsorption behaviour and unveiling the fundamental multiple electron-transfer processes. Herein, we propose performing in-situ HERFD-XAS characterization of Cu-N-C model catalyst for eNO3-RR. Through interpreting the evolution of pre-edge and rising edge features in HERFD-XANES spectra, we aim to address two fundamental questions: 1. How does the geometric configuration and oxidation state of Cu center evolve under varying potentials? 2.

Many parameters can affect their lifetime and performance in a battery, including particle size and size of the pores in the electrode. With increasing particle size, diffusion limits the progress of chemical reactions. Larger pore size can improve ion diffusion at a cost of lower energy density. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a tool to investigate nanostructural changes occurring in a short range, which are complementary to the atomic scale, long range information obtained with wide-angle Xray scattering (WAXS). We will study the changes in porosity and particle size for Sn, Sb and Bi anode materials during cycling in Na-ion batteries. By measuring these parameters during battery operation, we aim to get a better understanding of morphological changes during cycling, and find the optimal balance between porosity and particle size.","838":"The goal of this study is to observe the structural evolution of single palladium nanocrystals during hydrogen absorption and desorption in rarely explored regions of the phase diagram.

A key topic is the fate and transport range for this hydrothermal iron, to better understand its impact on the ocean nutrient inventory. Evidence is emerging that silicon coprecipitation and complexation with organic matter extend the lifetime of Fe in the ocean. We collected iron-rich nanoparticles and aggregates from one of the most iron-rich hydrothermal plumes know so far in the mid-Atlantic Rainbow vent field. We characterized the particles in detail with micro(spectro)scopy (TEM) and chemical methods. Sub-samples were then used in an aging experiment, to monitor changes to the iron particles and their interaction with seawater. Marked changes in particle morphology and chemistry occurred and we propose to use Fe K-edge EXAFS to determine the structural evolution. Our results will further elucidate how hydrothermal iron behaves in the global ocean and to what extent it becomes bioavailable.","843":"This proposal will provide user access to automated protein-to-structure and fragment screening pipelines based on the combination of EMBL HTX lab services and CrystalDirect technology and automated data collection at ESRF\u2019s MX beamlines, within the framework of the EMBL-ESRF JSBG agreement.

The identification of MB in extinct species would provide an objective means to recognize gravid females. However, reports of fossil MB-like tissues are contentious because MB resembles avian bone pathologies (BP). Recently, our team made progress establishing criteria unique to MB, with the goal of discriminating it from BP. We studied MB and BP in over 60 bird species and found that i) MB skeletal distribution is linked to pneumaticity, differing from BP; ii) MB microstructure is uniform among neognaths and small paleognaths, but may differ in large ratites, the most ancestral bird species; iii) some avian BP have a similar molecular composition as MB.

Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) alloys, which can produce a non-textured fine-grained microstructure due to the multi-phase transformation during layer-wise AM process, provide a potential mitigation to LAM challenges. However, the phenomenon is poorly understood and therefore can only crudely be exploited because no one has been able to observe the microstructures layer by layer in 3D. Here, we propose to use Dark Field X-ray Microscopy and the capability of in situ observation to understand the mechanism of cyclic microstructure transformation of TRIP steel during LAM process.

Fe-based catalysts are highly selective for tandem reactions of ethane dehydrogenation (DH) and CO2 reduction (CO2-EDH), even more when they are supported on a NiO containing mixed oxide. As undesired side reactions can decrease selectivity towards the main product, i.e. ethylene, the research challenge in CO2-EDH is to develop catalysts which can selectively cleave the C-H bond and preserve the C-C bond, while in parallel activate CO2, producing CO and oxygen species (O*).

By highlighting the spatial correlation of switching grains through their characteristic superstructure reflections we will better understand both the relation between crystallographic orientation and field direction and the microstructural origin of the observed structural response.","1162":"Here, we propose to investigate the structural phase transition Pbnm -> R-3c in PrNiO3 taking place at 773 K.

Experiments at these conditions could have crucial geological implications: during the early stages of the diagenetic process (i.e., zeolite facies), both pressure (P) and temperature (T) increase, following different thermal gradient (e.g., about 25\u00b0C\/Km for the first few kilometers of the continental crust). In this proposal, the PT behavior of two natural zeolites, laumontite ([(Ca4-xNax)Kx][Al8Si16O48]\u22c5(H2O)n, with n < 16) and offretite (K, Ca, Mg) Si13Al5O36 \u038715H2O which occur in a wide range of natural environments, including sedimentary deposits or volcanoclastic sequences interested by burial diagenesis\/metamorphism, as well as in hydrothermal vugs of volcanic rocks.

The goal is to establish the relationship\r\nbetween antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) orders in these compounds probably related to the presence of helimagnet spin order as observed in\r\nfull-inorganic anhydrous cupric halides parent compounds. To verify this picture, we propose to measure magnetic circular and linear dichroism at the Cu L2,3\r\nedges on hybrid single crystals.","1168":"Exsolution is a trendy way to improve the catalytic activity of oxide materials which can be used in SOFCs. It leads to a formation of metallic nanoparticles well\r\nsocketed to the oxide support and therefore resistive to agglomeration. In contradiction to the simultaneous exsolution of at least two types of ions from the oxide structure, the topotactic ion-exchange exsolution produces the layered perovskite without B-site vacancies, thereby preserving the atomic connectivity of the B\u2013O\u2013B network for efficient oxygen transport and electron conduction. The aim of this proposal is to investigate nanometric alloys or intermetallic compounds consisting of Ni\/Fe\/Co\/Cu which were formed on the surface of (La,Sr,Ce)TiO3-based host material. The measurements of X-ray absorption will reveal the local structure and valence state of the transition metals in formed nanometric alloys of intermetallic compounds on the surface, as well as the valence of the elements in the perovskite host oxide.","1169":"The environment is contaminated with numerous pollutants, such as heavy metals, microplastics (MPs), perfluorinated organic compounds, and pesticides, which toxicity and harmful impacts on human health, also related with gestational life, presents a critical emerging area for research.

Despite decades of investigation at the cellular level, the molecular basis of this so-called \u201clength-dependent activation\u201d (LDA) in cardiac muscle is still unclear. Here we will use a combination of mechanical protocols and small-angle X-ray diffraction at ID02 on electrically paced muscle tissue isolated from the rat heart to determine the dynamic structural changes in the constituent myosin and actin filaments induced by an increase in muscle length during the relaxed phase of the cardiac cycle. Disruption of LDA is a common pathogenic mechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction: the results of this research will provide new targets and assays for the development of new pharmacological approaches to treat heart failure in cardiac diseases. ","1174":"Super-dry reforming (SDR) is an enhanced process for bio(methane) and CO2 conversion, capable of intrinsic product separation and enhanced CO production. SDR couples catalytic reforming, redox activity and CO2 sorption into one chemical looping process, using three different materials: Ni catalyst, Fe3O4 metal oxide and CaO sorbent. For next-level SDR, we aim at combining these different functionalities into one material Ni\/MgCaFeAlOx to intensify the process. The interaction between the different elements and their functionalities will be explored by means of in situ characterization by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ni and Fe edges, while also testing at the Ca edge. The use of XAS is advantageous for catalysis research as it probes the electronic state (XANES) and local environment (EXAFS) of each element in the samples under realistic reaction conditions. ","1175":"Natural circular dichroism is the principal tool used to characterize chiral compounds. For this reason, the terms chirality and optical activity are often used interchangeably. However, these terms are distinct, which can be most clearly appreciated by comparing optical activity in the UV-visible range and in the X-ray range. Theoretically speaking, there are some enantiomorphic and UV-active crystal space groups where optical activity in the X-ray range is forbidden, while there also exists non-chiral space groups for which X-ray optical activity is allowed. As whatever is not forbidden must be observable, we here propose to record, for the first time, X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism (XNCD) for crystals belonging to the XNCD-active, but achiral and nonpolar, crystal class -42m.","1176":"Performing temperature scans of semicrystalline polymers with high charge-carrier mobility wit in-situ microfocused X-ray","1178":"Follow up on unraveling the peculiar internal structure of hematite microparticles after experiment # SC5258","1181":"The interaction between phospholipid liposomes and heat shock protein (Hsp70) will be studied by stopped-flow time-resolved SAXS.

Many of these are hydrophobic and are taken up by cancer cells through a process called endocytosis. However, such chemotherapeutics may be limited as they are retained in the lysosomes and fail to reach the DNA in the nucleus. Widely-used chemotherapeutics such as bleomycin and gemcitabine are well-known to suffer from this limitation. Other chemotherapeutics such as oxaliplatin are suspected to be similarly limited, yet concrete evidence is lacking. The aim of this proposal is to (1) confirm that oxaliplatin localizes within the endo-lysosomes in cancer cells, and (2) that oxaliplatin can be released by selective destruction of the lysosomes.","1188":"Dynamics at atomic length scales will be measured in hydrogenated metallic glasses and chalcogenide glasses around the structure factor peak  using Wide-Angle X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy as a function of temperature.

Up to now, superconductivity has not been found in any bulk sample with identical composition. In fact, the synthesis process involves a critical topochemical reduction which introduces defects (remaining oxygen atoms, Ni vacancies\u2026), maybe at a higher level in bulk materials, which could be at the origin of the absence of superconductivity. We want to quantify these defects at 300 K by XRD (and neutron diffraction, related proposal actually evaluated) at ID22 beamline of ESRF in our bulk (Nd1-xCax)NiO2 samples, insulating at low T, where doping is introduced by Ca2+ doping.

In contrast to other arthropods, e.g. crustaceans, who employ mineral for cuticle hardening, spiders and scorpions (class Arachnida) fabricate hard and sharp parts entirely without mineral. Alternatively, they often use locally elevated levels of metal ions such as Zn and Mn, as they are also found in scorpion stingers. A recent experiment at BM05, however, showed strong variations of metal ion type and distribution, both between species and in different locations of the stinger, suggesting substantial variation of strategies or even metal ion functionalites different from just mechanics. We wish to follow up by doing XRF and XRD on slices of stingers from different species to get insight into the structure, composition and functionality of scorpion stingers, a fascinating, but not fully explored type of biological tissue.

In response to the reviewer of previous round about why there is interest in pores at 650 degrees for Ti6Al4V as this is not an operating temperature: Additive manufacturing is maturing very well but porosity remains an issue - pores act as stress concentration locations, initiating cracks and failure under cyclic loading. Hot isostatic pressing is widely used now for critical applications to eliminate this threat, since it has been shown to close pores, improve microstructure and, consequently improve fatigue properties. However, a deeper understanding of this pore closure is needed. This project aims to image and provide insight into pores that have been closed but then re-open after subsequent heat treatment. Not because heat treatment is expected in practice but to better understand the \"squeezed pores state\".

For nanocrystalline NiTi wires, we have recently developed a multiscale approach combining grain-level reconstruction of martensitic\/austenitic microstructures deformed by TEM SAED-DF method with deformation analysis from in-situ texture evolution. The former studies deformation in individual grains, while the latter studies the same statistically in thousands of grains upon synchrotron diffraction. We have conducted isothermal tensile tests, in this work we will perform in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction texture evolution experiments on two NiTi wires upon heating\/cooling\/loading. We aim to reveal deformation modes acting upon thermomechanical loads frequently used in engineering applications of NiTi, as thermal actuator cycling, functional fatigue, low temperature shape setting and two way shape memory effect.","1199":"The recent discovery of direct and indirect glutamatergic communication between neurons and a subpopulation of brain tumour cells that drive brain tumour progression in high-grade pediatric and adult gliomas as well as breast cancer brain metastases shows the importance of neuronal activity on brain tumour progression.

Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offer high potential for the environmentally friendly passive capture of clean water from humid air. However, a detailed mechanistic, structural, and electronic understanding of the dynamic adsorption-desorption process is lacking. Here, we propose a combined in situ hard-X-ray XAS\/XRD study targeting metal sites to investigate the electronic and crystal structure modifications during water adsorption and desorption in prototypical water harvesting MOF systems with and without open metal centres.

The success and longevity of the implantation process depends on it. In that context, the requested time slot will be used to assess for the displacements induced during the implant insertion process, in order to estimate the strains developed in the peri-implant bone. It is assumed that the strains experienced by the bone around a self-tapping implant are different from those experienced around an implant whose shaft is pre-tapped. The aim of this study is hence to investigate the difference in peri-implant bone strains development around both types of implants.

At pH higher than 4.5, basaluminite exerts a strong solubility control on dissolved toxic Al and has been described as a highly efficient scavenger for toxic As. However, it has been shown that the SO4 content in basaluminite is variable due to a substitution with OH, highlighting a possible solid solution between basaluminite and nanoboehmite. The structural changes associated with this solid solution may affect the As adsorption behavior. We propose HEXD experiments with both natural and synthetic basaluminite samples to determinate how the pH and temperature during precipitation affect their nanomineral structure. This analysis will help to obtain a more predictive understanding of the mobility of toxic elements such as As and Al under changing alpine climatic conditions.","1207":"It is now evident that many materials feature superconducting phases when a CDW phase is suppressed by extrinsic parameters such as pressure or intercalation in layered materials. However, studies in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) found that the phase space of emergent superconductivity is not close to the CDW quantum critical point. Here, we propose to determine the CDW quantum critical point in 2H-TaSe2 under pressure via x-ray diffraction (XRD). Based on our ambient-pressure study of the soft phonon mode at the CDW transition in 2H-TaSe2 (unpublished) and published resistivity measurements, we argue that this compound likely has a CDW quantum critical point closely connected to the emergent superconducting phase and could be a textbook example where both phases are mediated by the same mechanism, electron-phonon coupling of the CDW soft phonon mode. Our study will determine the CDW phase diagram in its most crucial but still unexplored area.

Here, we aim to investigate the structural dynamics of the photoreaction of Fe3(CO)12 using time-resolved x-ray liquidography (TRXL), which is directly sensitive to the molecular structure. By doing so, we seek to verify whether the assignments of the reaction pathways reported from the previous literature are valid.","1212":"Carbonate minerals are  present not only in the Earth crust, but even in the deeper part of our planet, being involved in the carbon cycle.

Upon temperature increase, these two minerals show phases transitions, that for now, were studied only taking into account the average structure. Interestingly, no structural analysis on the local structure by Pair Distribution Function (PDF) has ever been considered .To determine a link between the local structure and their behaviours upon heating, we propose an investigation using total scattering data collection. BaCo3 and SrCO3 will be investigated as well as their calcium counterpart (calcite and aragonite).

Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy.

This picture is also accepted in HTS: a QCP is postulated at p*, where the pseudogap ends at T\u21920. This scenario is overturned by recent experiments, hinting at a subordinal role of pseudogap. This either implies the absence of a QCP, or the presence of a QCP having different origin. To unravel this puzzle, we propose to study with RIXS charge density fluctuations (CDF), which permeate the strange metal at p<p*, in overdoped YBCO and Bi2212. CDF have been associated to the strange metal, and at p* have highest intensity and minimum energy. This hints to their active role in forming a QCP at p*. To confirm this, we will check if CDF are present also at p>p* and, if so, their doping dependence. The results will tell us if the HTS physics is connected to a quantum critical scenario, and if CDF are the quantum fluctuations related to the QCP.","1254":"The aim of this proposal is to perform an EXAFS experiment at the Zr and Ti K-edges on the following pyrochlore systems: a) Gd2(Zr1-xTix)2O7 solid solutions,\r\nwhich are promising compositions as matrices for the immobilization of actinides, and b) single and double doped (Gd1-yNdy)2(Zr1-zCez)2O7 compounds,\r\nto simulate the actinides immobilization (Nd3+ and Ce4+ are used as surrogates for incorporated Am3+ and Pu4+, respectively).

Such\r\n mesocrystalline systems are characterized by both long-range packing arrangement and orientational order of nanoparticles. Therefore, the in-situ study of the\r\n self-assembly process should reveal the aggregation dynamic of nanoparticles and their crystallographic alignment during mesocrystal growth. Recently, we\r\n have demonstrated that simultaneous collection of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering with the same detector greatly improves the precision of scattering\r\n geometry optimization and increases the recoverable information content. Thus, simultaneously the average structure of nanoparticle units and their assembly\r\n can be studied.

We plan to achieve this by using the combination of in-situ simultaneous GISAXS and GIWAXS at the liquid interface under controlled solvent evaporation conditions. Controlling the removal of insulation long alkyl chain ligands is key to tune the QD array\u2019s stoichiometry and structure in the range necessary to manipulate the density of states and charge transport, allowing to fabricate materials with high optoelectronic performances. By performing this in-situ experiment, we will determine the optimum conditions to achieve maximum order in the ligand-capped QD SLs and understand how to minimize the loss of structural order during ligand removal.","1261":"The increased prevalence of multi antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been listed by the WHO as one of the biggest threats to modern day healthcare, food security and development. Short antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting attention as an alternative to conventional antibiotics, and can target a range of microbes including viruses, fungus, bacteria and parasites. Previously we have investigated the selective activity of peptide R4F4 which was shown to reorganise membranes and be selectively active against p.aeurginosa. Here we plan to examine the self-assembly of AMPs based on this peptide, and investigate peptide interactions with model bacterial and human membranes using SAXS, with the aim of using this information to determine how the membrane is restructured which may lead to the antimicrobial activitty.  The current aim is to improve the potency of this molecule, and understand the effects on the mechanism of action invoked from changes in primary sequences. ","1263":"Cu-exchanged chabazite zeolites (Cu-CHA) are excellent catalysts for NOx removal from the exhaust gas of diesel vehicles, via the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 to N2 and H2O (NH3-SCR). However, these catalysts deactivate upon exposure to SO2, that is formed from the sulfur-containing compounds in the diesel fuel. As we showed in our recent paper using XANES, EXAFS and XES data from BM23 and ID26, SO2 reacts predominantly with the [CuII2(NH3)4O2]2+ complex, and the other Cu-species in the NH3-SCR cycle remain virtually unaffected. To better understand the impact of SO2, it is important to look at the interaction between the catalyst and NO after exposure to SO2. In the proposed experiment we will reveal the influence of SO2 on the interaction between NO and Cu-CHA by monitoring the reaction of the [CuII2(NH3)4O2]2+ complex with NO in situ before and after exposure to SO2.","1265":"While performances in organic solar cells (OSCs) have soared in the last five years, the lack of stability is hindering the commercialization of flexible, wearables devices. Among the different sources of instability, the diffusion of small molecules out of the mixed domains has been identified as a very important and inherent issue that must be tackled. However, there is still a lack understanding about the structural interaction between rigid conjugated polymers and non-fullerene acceptor molecules, that are nowadays the keystone system for high efficiency OSCs. We have proved in recent experiments how the same system yield different mixing behavior with different thermal stability upon the experimental parameters during fabrication. We aim to study the synergies and structural interactions between a series of conjugated polymers and small molecules, approaching a correlation between the blend and their thermal stability, that will be critical for their performance stability.\r\n","1266":"This proposal is a collaborative effort of the Structural Biology Groups of Madrid with the objective to form a strong core of scientist devoted to this area of research in Spain.

We recently observed (exp.CH6110) the activity of MIL-100(Fe) metal organic framework (MOF) in the selective oxidation of methane to methanol (MTM) in mild conditions. A recent theoretical work as also shown that a similar MOF, named PCN250, built upon the same trimetallic Fe-based nodes, if isolated with mixed metals (Fe\/Cr), is predicted to possess lower barriers energy for the N2O and C\u2212H bond activation. Many questions remain open, such as the electronic\/structural properties of the active intermediate and the possible cooperation of Cr during the MTM oxidation. Indeed, we here propose a combined in situ XAS\/XES study, targeting the redox of Fe and Cr sites during the whole catalytic cycle to get a deep understanding of the active sites (Fe\/Cr or both?), of the reactive intermediates and of the possible cooperation of both metals during MTM oxidation reaction.","1268":"The goal of this proposal is to study the H2-induced reconstruction of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) in Pt\/Al2O3 catalysts by time-resolved XRD\/PDF experiments under gas- and liquid-phase conditions. Previous multi-technique gas-phase experiments pointed to morphology changes of the Pt NPs as a function of H-coverage. The behavior in liquid-phase conditions is less explored, although preliminary ATR-IR measurements indicate that the solvent plays a relevant role.\r\nHere, we want to extend the comparison between gas-phase and liquid-phase conditions to cover the structural dynamics of Pt NPs a) during Pt-hydride\r\nformation; b) as a function of the H-coverage, and c) during the hydrogenation of toluene as a model reaction.

Neuroprotection is demanded in eye disorders such as glaucoma, where death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) takes place through different mechanisms. Mitochondria are involved in cellular processes ranging from metabolic functions to calcium homeostasis and the regulation of cell death. Activation of mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptors has an important role in excitotoxic degeneration of RGCs. Targeting mitochondria and mGlu1 receptors could be a potential disease modifying treatment for optic neuropathies where no treatment is currently available. X-ray nano-holotomography will be used to image and quantify lesions at subcellular levels in the retina of mice with increased intra ocular pressure.","1272":"We propose full-field coherent diffraction measurements of polycrystal grains at a high beam energy, with the long-term goal of characterizing crystalline deformation across many length scales. We will exploit the enhanced beam coherence of the ESRF-EBS at high energies to make a combined DCT\/BCDI measurement at 33 keV. This will be a vital first step in developing a general capability to study crystalline materials simultaneously on multiple length scales varying from ~10 nm to ~10 um. A successful reconstruction will enable BCDI feasibility studies for large crystals, addressing issues like absorption and refraction. It will also bridge a critical gap in length scales currently separating coherence-based techniques like BCDI from conventional high-energy methods like DCT and HEDM.  Unifying these so-far separate characterization methods is crucial for future multi-scale synchrotron studies of polycrystals and grain boundary interactions.","1277":"Developing rare-earth-free permanent magnets with competitive magnetic performance is a necessary step forward to enable an ecological transition based on clean energy generation and green mobility (wind turbines, e-vehicles). Our research group has recently patented a novel cold sintering method for fabricating rare-earth-free hexaferrite-based magnets, which allows reducing sintering temperature, and in turn, lowering the energy consumption in >30% compared to the sintering methods used in industry. We intend to replicate this process in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) and follow it in situ based on time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, with the aim of: (i) gaining a deeper understanding of the process itself and of the various phase changes undergone, (ii) refining the preparation method to better control the produced material, ideally further reducing the sintering temperature.","1278":"The last decade has seen an intense scientific debate on Neanderthal lineage growth pattern. The pioneering use of synchrotron imaging on fossils teeth allowed for the first time to record neanderthal dental growth in a non-destructive way. However, relatively few samples have been analyzed and variability in the growth pattern and associated evolutionary mechanisms are still largely unknown. To answer these questions, we collected a large sample of unpublished and invaluable fossil teeth of the Neanderthal lineage in Europe. We have also selected modern human deciduous teeth with the specific focus of investigating their family relationships based on the heritability of dental growth biorhythms which are under strong genetic control. ID19 is the only hard X-ray beamline in Europe enabling to image dental hard tissues microstructure for paleoanthropology with high coherence, low dose, high energy photons, a large field-of-view, and using phase contrast \u00b5CT.","1280":"In metal additive manufacturing, the large thermal anisotropy, which takes place during the deposition and the melting of the metallic powder, leads to anisotropic grain microstructures and highly heterogeneous precipitagtion. The knowledge of thermal, physical and metallurgical phenomena developing from the nanometric to the mesoscopic scale is essential to understand and model the behavior of these new class of materials, to develop alloy composition adapted to the thermal and mechanical loadings of components during service.

Exposing the NPs to formic acid (HCOOH) allows for tracking of adsorption-induced structural changes inside the particles and at the interface between the organic molecules and the oxide NP surfaces. The interaction at the interface is argued to be the key element for the exceptional mechanical stability of a new class of nanocomposite materials, assembled from magnetite NPs linked by carboxylic acids. A detailed atomistic understanding of the magnetite surface\/ organic acid interface is vital to further tailor the mechanical properties of such novel nanocomposite materials.","1285":"Nannoconus are a group of calcareous nannofossils (um size) produced by marine planktonic organisms that were important calcifiers during the Cretaceous. They represent an important group due to their successful development and the high calcification rate, which contributed to buffer the acidification of the oceans in the Early Cretaceous. Despite their abundance for a long time, nothing is known about both the mode of calcification and the chemical composition of Nannoconus exoskeleton. These informations are needed to explain their success as marine calcifiers in changing lower Cretaceous climate and oceans, and to decipher the paleochemistry of the oceans. In particular, determining metal (Sr, Mg) contents in their calcite plates can help solving these questions. Here, we propose to reconstruct the chemical composition of three families of nannofossils abundant in the Early Cretaceous by using X-ray micro-fluorescence spectroscopy (\u00b5-XRF) with synchrotron radiation at ESRF (ID21).

In particular spinel ferrites (AFe2O4) and iron garnets (A3Fe5O12) due to their unique ferrimagnetic, ferroelectric, multiferroic, or photoconductive behaviour. These compounds are known for their complex magnetic behaviour and structural and magnetic phase transitions, which may change depending on film thickness and growth conditions. Here we want to access the element specific magnetic properties of epitaxial (Fe,Cr,Ni)3O4(111) and (Tm,Er)Fe5O12(111) layers to determine the impact of composition on the local magnetic properties (exchange couplings and anisotropy) of these iron oxides.

Using high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD), we will study HERFD-XAS of La(Mn,Ni)O3 thin films (thickness: 0.4-10 nm) and nanoparticles (size: 30-50 nm) under operando conditions. The HERFD-XAS pre-edges contain 1s3d quadrupole local and 1s4p pre-edge nonlocal transitions, in which the extracted information of spin state and covalency plays a vital role in describing the activity. Moreover, we will measure the 1s2p RIXS that probes the \u201cL2,3 XAS-like\u201d information.

It has yielded tens of thousands of fossils, representing a snapshot of an ancient wetland ecosystem composed of lizards, birds, amphibians, mammals, fishes, flying reptiles, turtles, crocodiles and dinosaurs. One of the most conspicuous species of dinosaur found at Angeac-Charente is a giant sauropod belonging to Turiasauria. This proposal aims to investigate the internal anatomy of two cranial elements using X-ray synchrotron micro computed tomography: the braincase in order to reconstruct its endocast, the neuroanatomy and the internal ear, and the maxilla to access the morphology and microanatomy of unerupted teeth. All these biological characters have important functional implications, particularly in terms of cognitive abilities and feeding strategy.

First, we want to quantify the state of alteration of smalt in historical and model samples in order to propose digital reconstructions of the original aspects of the paintings and second, we want to investigate the chemical interactions between the pigment and its environment to have a better understanding on the weathering causes. MicroXANES at the Co K-edge at ID21 has successfully been used to differentiate an altered smalt from a well-preserved one, but the penetration of X-rays at this energy prevents probing the state of weathering at the grain scale. We propose to combine submicronic XRF and high resolution microXANES mapping of smalt grains and their environment at the Co and K K-edges to relate its chemical state to the color of the grains and to follow the chemical transformations of K leached out of the grains","1301":"Operation stability of cathode active materials (CAMs) for Li-ion batteries at elevated temperatures is a major bottleneck to overcome for their broad market penetration. Ageing mechanisms, such as the dissolution of transition metals (TMs) and their subsequent deposition on the anode have been shown to significantly accelerate with increasing temperature, resulting in cell ageing and eventually failure. Within this proposal, we aim for a comparative evaluation of the impact of temperature, upper cut-off potential and TM composition on the dissolution of TMs from conventional (NCM111) and Ni-rich (NCM811 and NCA) CAMs. The dissolved TMs are quantified under operando conditions by probing XANES at Mn, Co, and Ni-K-edges within the electrolyte, as well as on the counter electrode, using a special cell setup which enables both heating and the spatial resolution of TMs within the cell volume.","1302":"The goal of this project is to evaluate redox conditions and trends in subducted oceanic crust by determining compositions of zoned, transition-metal-bearing minerals and evaluating the results as a function of P-T conditions.

A new family of bis-(oxal)amide nucleating agents to promote high crystallization rates in these biobased polyesters have been developed in our group. By means of the molecular design of the nucleating agents melt miscibility and nucleation are triggered although the exact mechanism of polymer nucleation is unknown to date.

In such cases, a winding pattern of in-plane magnetization surrounds a perpendicular core, whose extent is typically a few nanometers. If the film thickness increases, transmission measurements seem to indicate that the core diameter always remain below ca. 100 nm; on the other hand, simulations hint at a more complex, 3D structure reminiscent of a barrel.\r\nWe propose to image vortex cores (VCs) using magnetic coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) on micron-sized CoGd beads. In these systems, we have confirmed the presence of vortices with Magnetic Force Microscopy as well as XMCD-PEEM, with VCs over 200 nm in diameter from MFM. Thus, for the first time in 3D magnetic imaging, the resolution would be sufficient to reveal the full structure of such a 3D vortex configuration. Moreover, prior sample demagnetization should promote the presence of micromagnetic singularities (Bloch points) in the cores.","1308":"We would like to perform X-ray nano-Hollography Tomography to characterize the microstructure of the oxide precursors used to synthesize Li-rich layered oxide positive electrode materials.

Even though the formation of the I-CDW is related to a complete softening of an optical phonon branch it is seen to be of unconventional nature. Elastoresitance measurements reveal an electronic nematic phase suggesting this system to be candidate system for charge-driven electronic nematicity. Recent near edge x-ray absorption fine structure measurements show a connection of the CDWs with orbital ordering, suggesting that nematicity could rise from orbital fluctuations.

However, in the past decade, seminal work by Ananikov and co-workers has established that Pd- and Pt-based carbene-functionalized nanoparticles, clusters and complexes co-exist in a dynamic equilibrium. High-resolution X-ray absorption measurements (HERFD-XAS) have proven useful for the resolution of complex reaction mixtures. The interpretation of XAS is facilitated using cross-reading based on computational models. Since solvent effects are crucial for these systems, molecular dynamics simulations at the DFT level (DFT-MD) of fully solvated Ni nanoparticles in a solvent cell are expected to provide an appropriate model for these complex systems.

Among synchrotron beamlines that enabled this shift in paradigm, ID13 stands out for its unmatched brilliance and focusing. A limit was however reached with nanocrystals of the mosquitocidal toxin Cyt1Aa which, before the EBS upgrade, diffracted to 4.5 \u00c5 resolution at 100 K on ID13, compared to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution at RT at LCLS. As the flux at ID13 is now ~50 times higher, chances are high that higher resolution data can be collected from these crystals at 100 K \u2013 and possibly even at RT - using nano-SSX. The goal of our proposal is to verify this hypothesis and benchmark the nano-SSX capabilities of ID13 after the EBS upgrade, thereby assessing whether nano-SSX could lead the future of macromolecular crystallography.","1343":"This proposal aims to solve the structure of a series of new Mn(III)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a flexible structure, as well as investigating their guest sorption properties. The series of new MOFs is related to the well-known MIL-53, which possesses a breathing behaviour. The originality of our series of MOFs, apart from the fact that it is based on Mn(III) metal centres, is that it has alkoxy bridging linkers. It is known that both, the nature of the metal centres and of the bridging linkers have an important influence on the breathing behaviour of MIL-53. We aim at solving the structure of several of those MOFs with linkers of various sizes (EtO-, PrO-, etc.) with the help of variable-temperature X-ray synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments; collecting very good quality diffraction data is mandatory. Furthermore, adsorption of guests and possible flexibility of the structure of the new MOFs will be investigated with respect to various solvents and gasses.","1344":"Vanadia-based catalysts are the system of choice for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 (NH3-SCR) in stationary plant applications.. Despite being largely studied, a comprehensive picture of the structure-activity relation at atomistic level for these catalysts is still under way. Furthermore, the NH3-SCR catalytic activity enhancement, due to the presence of HCl in the stationary plant exhaust feed, so far has been largely neglected. To rationalize the active sites oxidation state and redox dynamics, the local structure, and the reaction pathway, with this proposal we aim at systematically investigating a model V\/TiO2 catalyst by operando XAS during NH3-SCR. We will focus on high-quality XANES and EXAFS data collection in reaction conditions, to determine the V5+\/V4+ redox dynamics, the role of HCl and the coordination of the adsorbed reaction intermediates.","1347":"We suppose that accurate temperature dependent X-ray powder diffraction measurements in order to study unusual effect of crystal structure transformation of mono- LaCoO3 and multi-valent metastable La0.5Ba0.5CoO2.87 modified by pulsed magnetic field 20 Tesla.

Obtained X-ray diffraction results will be combined with pressure-dependent XMCD and neutron diffraction data as well as temperature-dependent XRD results at ID-22 and neutron diffraction (HRPT, PSI) in order to give us the opportunity to establish the correlations between crystal and magnetic structure changes and clarify the origin of magneto-structural phase transition near the PM\u2192FM\u2192AFM transitions, as well as to provide an input for a novel modeling methods based on the density functional theory (DFT, DFT+U, DFT+U+SO) and the dynamic mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT).","1348":"New generations of nuclear reactors require the development of innovative methods to elaborate nuclear fuels. Within this framework, studies have been devoted to the hydrothermal conversion of An(IV) oxalates (An = Th, U, Np, Pu) which allows the direct and quantitative precipitation of hydrated oxides from solution. In this frame, our group is currently studying the hydrothermal conversion of uranium(IV)-cerium(III) mixed oxalates into oxides, cerium being used as a surrogate for plutonium. These two elements can exist in several oxidation state in solution, thereby inducing a complex redox behaviour during hydrothermal treatment. In situ HERFD-XANES experiments will be used to directly monitor the redox state and the speciation of both elements during hydrothermal conversion of oxalates under various conditions of temperature and pH. Understanding of these conversion mechanisms will then allow to deduce optimum experimental conditions for the synthesis of uranium-cerium oxides.","1349":"Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) in the manganite perovskites arises from intrinsic electronic phase separation (EPS) occurring because of the competition between ferromagnetic conducting and antiferromagnetic orbitally ordered insulating phases, at specific doping levels. However, the very nature of the EPS state has frustrated any attempts over the past 3 decades to accurately characterise the microscopic structures of its constituents. We propose a diffraction resolved tomography experiment with nano-focused beam on ID11 to tackle this long-standing problem. The results will allow for accurate microscopic structural models of the competing states to be ascertained for the first time and will also provide a 3-dimensional map of strain fields within the electronically separated phases on a 0.1-100 \u03bcm length scale. Our insights will lead to a broader understanding of how these functional properties are linked with EPS phenomena so that these can be systematically tuned and enhanced.","1351":"scan the spine of sagitta by micro X-ray diffraction","1352":"Cathode engineering the particle morphology has emerged as a promising route for increasing capacity retention in lithium batteries, with the recent million-mile single crystalline (SC) cathodes, where interparticle cracking and oxygen loss are suppressed compared to their polycrystalline (PC) counterparts.

These pieces are subjected to long-term (>1000h) in-service ageing at temperatures between 150-200\u00b0C, close to the initial precipitation ageing temperatures. The effect of this ageing on the nano-precipitates is both challenging to explore (given the duration and potential temperature range) and to model since multiple mechanisms are at play. The aim of this proposal which is part of the PhD project of Thomas Perrin (with SAFRAN Transmission Systems) is to use space-resolved SAXS-WAXS on multiple samples aged for long durations (up to 5000h) in a gradient furnace, so that we can acquire all kinetics at all temperatures. This would represent an unprecedented corpus of data which would enable to distinguish between the possible mechanisms (in particular, the potential phase transitions that would be detected by WAXS) and which would serve as a training set for the alloy design model.","1356":"Evaluating the impact of X-ray dose on samples for follow-up electron microscopy","1357":"High-temperature measurements on mineral olivine","1358":"The study of the prevailing factors impacting the dissolution kinetics of UO2-based compounds is of primary importance to forecast the behavior of the SNF during its reprocessing.

Our first results revealed a much lower chemical durability of U1-yNdyO2-x samples compared to UO2. A 100-fold increase in dissolution rate was found between samples prepared at 700 and 1200\u00b0C suggesting important differences in U valence states and O vacancies concentrations. In this aim, HEFRD-XANES measurements will provide us crucial information on the U speciation in the prepared solids (various temperatures and operating atmospheres), especially in terms of U(IV)\/U(V) ratio. In the meantime, the analysis of U and Nd environments by EXAFS will allow us to confirm the presence of O vacancies.","1359":"We will be measuring X-ray reflectivity of  various samples that have quantum applications.\r\nThese sample consist of stacked films with different thickness on Si substrate. \r\nWe will be using new lenses of ID31 to achieve submicron beamsize.

The tetramer is stable in dark conditions, while exposure to light induces tetramer dissolution and dissociation from DNA, thus allowing gene expression. The suppressed gene controls the biosynthesis of carotenoids that protects bacteria from excess of sunlight (Jost et al., 2015). CarH\u2019s dissociation mechanism has been studied by time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. Two photoreaction pathways have been proposed, providing insight into a number of intermediates formed during the dissociation process (Kutta et al., 2015 ; Miller et al., 2020). In both mechanisms the cobalt (Co) atom contained in the corrin of the B12 moiety plays the most important role by sensing light.

Both operando and post mortem BCDI studies are very well suited to study this phenomenon since they will allow to gather structural information on the strain gradients inside the particles. We expect BCDI to give us insight into the interfacial reactions between Jahn-Teller distorted surface lattices and the electrolyte that is responsible for the capacity fade in LMNO. Moreover, the operando BCDI data on strain transformation inside a single particle would give us valuable information about the change of lithium ionic order and phase evolution at the nanoscale.","1370":"We propose an experiment involving valence band RIXS at ID26 to search for discrete excitations out of the 7F0 singlet ground state of Am3+. Americium is known to have localised 5f electrons, and the M4 absorption peak is small, as the j = 5\/2 state is almost full, so that elastic transitions into this state are strongly suppressed. Calculations (below) show that the elastic signal is small, but there is a strong inelastic transition at 1.8 eV. This should be observable on ID26.

The XAS\/XMCD measurements seem to be the only technique that enables direct insight into the electronic\/magnetic structure of W, where the photo-induced changes take place. The unequivocal determination of the photoswitching mechanism was not possible using other general techniques such as single-crystal and powder XRD or IR spectroscopy.

Our interest in this structural family is due to its two perpendicular glide symmetries. On the one hand, this non-symmorphicity may give rise to topological crystalline insulating states including wallpaper fermions or the elusive axion-insulator. On the other hand, we recently discovered that these symmetries enforce complex noncollinear magnetic order that separates into compensated antiferromagnetic and weakly Ising-ferrimagnetic regimes. Neutron and muon studies and (conventional) resonant x-ray scattering have provided us with strong evidence that this mesoscale magnetism must occur on a length scale between 90nm and 15um. The real-space observation using nanofocus-SXDM will open up a range of follow-up studies, with the ultimate goal to magnetically manipulate arrangements of topologically distinct insulating domains.","1377":"Reconstructing ancient behaviour is crucial to better grasping the evolutionary origins of mammals; however, fossilised evidence of behavioural complexity is elusive.

Improved knowledge of the adaptations of the nervous system and cranial structure to withstand those fights will provide, for the first time, insight into the diversity of complex social behaviours in therapsids. This will be accompanied by a study of brain size to address whether sociality had an effect on encephalisation. This study has the potential to highlight the existence of complex social behaviours many millions of years before the origin of mammals.","1378":"Despite the paramount importance of carbon dioxide as a simple system and also as a geophysical relevant material, the experimental investigations are limited so far only up to 120 GPa.

Recently, different conformations of the S3 state (MnIV4 with S = 3 or S = 6)1\u20133 have been presented using EPR spectroscopy and proposed to be intermediates of the catalytic cycle. The heterogeneity is dependent on the treatment of Photosystem II and interestingly, is species-dependent i.e., different S3 configurations have been proposed for procaryotes (low spin S3 form) and eucaryotes (high spin S3 form). Based on DFT it was proposed that the two different configurations of S3 would lead to two different mechanisms of O2 formation in the next step (oxo-oxyl mechanism vs MnV nucleophilic attack). The two different S3 conformers present distinct pre-edge spectra.

PACs are light-activated enzymes that combine the capacity of a photoreceptor with that of an adenylyl cyclase; the latter being an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) to cAMP. We propose to use time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS) in combination with an established photocaging approach to track in real time the structural changes occurring in the photoactivated adenylyl cyclase from a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (OaPAC) during its catalytic reaction, upon light illumination.","1392":"In our proposed stopped-flow SAXS experiments we want to elucidate the structure of the initially formed complexes during the mixing of humic acid with oppositely charged cationic polyelectyolyte (cPE).

According to preliminary data, HGO immersed in long 1-alcohols (carbon numbers C14, C16, C18, C20) shows swelling transition at elevated temperatures with sharp change of inter-layer distance. HGO swelling in small alcohols (methanol and ethanol) is known from earlier studies to show completely different type of structural changes with absent of well defined swelling transitions. No studies were so far performed for HGO in other alcohols between ethanol (C2) and 1-pentadecanol C15. We suggest to study temperature dependence of swelling for HGO immersed in a set of liquid 1-alcohols with chain length C3 to C15.

It has been proposed that the reconstruction occurs in YBa2Cu3Oy for dopings less than the critical doping where the pseudogap appears, p<p* and that the pseudogap is responsible.  Recent id32 experiments on the overdoped clean superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+\u03b4 (Tl2201) suggest an alternate explanation. In Tl2201, the Fermi surface (FS) reconstruction is due to CDW order present below a certain doping p<p_CDW where there is no pseudogap. Here we propose to search for evidence of CDW order in overdoped Y1-yCayBa2Cu3O6+x at dopings the near the critical doping p* of the pseudogap. If such order were observed, it would suggest that the CDW is also the primary cause of the FS reconstruction in YBCO and have general implications for understanding the electron structure of the cuprates.

Motivated by our results it has been proposed that quantum paraelectrics are driven by a flexo-electric coupling that leads to longrange-ordered modulated phase. Here we apply for five days of experiment on Cristal to study the diffuse scattering associated with this TA softening and its evolution in the ferroelectric phase of SrTiO3 (through the substitution with Ca doping).

Very surprisingly, these 2DEGs show very weak superconductivity at the (001) interface (Tc<50 mK), but robust Tc of 2.2K and 1.1 K at the (111) and (110) interfaces, respectively.\r\n Here, we propose polarization dependent Ta-NIII (Ta 4p->5d) [4] and O-K (O 1s->2p) [5] edges x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to establish the Ta-5d crystal-field symmetry and t2g splitting, and their relationship with the ground states in the 2DEGs formed at the (001), (110) and (111) interfaces between KTO, non-magnetic (LaAlO3, AlOx) and ferromagnetic (EuO) overlayers.

PBGs are the products of the room-temperature reaction between metakaolin and a diluted phosphoric acid solution and are composed mainly by an amorphous aluminophosphate matrix. While many efforts are being made in the study of their structural units\u2019 identity and connectivity, much is still unknown about the dissolution\/depolymerization\/condensation reactions involved in the build-up of the structure. For this reason, we propose to investigate the dynamics of the system during the polymerization stage by employing SAXS-XPCS, to get an insight into the aggregation and gelation processes, which are intimately related to the PBG rheology and final microstructure. The results will provide fundamental data to gain control of PBG properties acting on synthesis parameters.","1414":"The aim of this proposal is to (1) determine the high-pressure stabilities of the crystal structures of three polymorphic forms of thiophosphoranyl anthracenes (alpha-AnPS, beta-AnPS, gamma-AnPS), (2) evaluate the pressure-induced changes in the molecular packing and intermolecular interactions, (3) determine the pressure evolution of the pi-stacking distance and anthracene overlap area in the pi-stacked dimers of beta-AnPS and gamma-AnPS, and (4) correlate the structural changes with the solid-state emission properties at high pressure. The proposed study will enable to deduce the effect of structural changes on the emission properties and to fine-tune their photoluminescent properties. Moreover, the proposed project will provide an answer whether by varying the distances between the anthracene molecules as well as their overlap, it is possible to modify the optical effect in a controlled manner.","1415":"Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a worldwide growing developmental dental condition in paediatric dentistry with a prevalence of up to 44 %. MIH-teeth are highly prone to fracture and caries as hardness, elasticity, and acidic resistance of the enamel barrier are deteriorated. It is unclear why the\r\nmechanical properties with respect to the mineral phases are so significantly compromised. Sound enamel exhibits high stiffness and hardness. The drastic difference indicates structural changes in MIH. In this experiment we aim to target the orientation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystallites in MIH-affected enamel in comparison to sound enamel with high-resolution scanning 3D-XRD. This experiment will reveal the hidden HAP crystallite orientation distribution in real 3D volume and provide information on the degree of mis-orientation in MIH-enamel on the nano-scale, eventually, shedding light on the disturbed amelogenesis process in MIH. \r\n","1416":"It is know well known that the structural evolution of a thermoplastic polymer upon stretching is closely linked with the stretching conditions (i.e. stretching\r\ntemperature and speed). Former studies carried out by our group have shown that the nature of the strain-induced phase (i.e. cristalline, mesomorphic...) is\r\nalso related to the macromolecular dynamics into the material and that relationships exist between these characteristic relaxation times, the nature of the strain-induced phase and the stretching conditions. However, up to now the determination of the macromolecular dynamics, in situ upon stretching, remains a challenge. The goal of this work is thus to measure the influence of orientation on the macromolecular dynamics of a polymer upon stretching, in situ, using the XPCS technique (which is one of the few allowing such measurements) in order to definitely confirm the relationships existing between the macromolecular dynamics and the nature of the strain induced-phase","1417":"We are interested in the study of structure\/function relationships of nickel enzymes, nickel proteins and nickel protein-based artificial metalloenzymes.

In contrast to other arthropods, e.g. crustaceans, who employ mineral for cuticle hardening, spiders and scorpions (class Arachnida) fabricate hard and sharp parts entirely without mineral. Alternatively, they often use locally elevated levels of metal ions such as Zn and Mn, as they are also found in scorpion stingers. A recent experiment at BM05, however, showed strong variations of metal ion type and distribution, both between species and in different locations of the stinger, suggesting substantial variation of strategies or even metal ion functionalites different from just mechanics.

Single crystals of the porous materials can be employed as molecular templates for crystallizing MHs within the cavities. In this way, geometry, functionality, electric charge and topology of the pores determines the structure of resulting MH nano-sized units, what might enable rational synthesis of desired solids and gives access to structures which are not known to form otherwise, and thus further tailoring optoelectronic properties.

These anomalies point to the possible existence of a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in Te, which is similar to the one purported in water.

","1447":"During a recent XPCS beamtime at DESY we probed the dynamical response of a metallic glass (MG) of Zr46.8Ti8.2Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 (vit4) and we obtained the first experimental evidence of a fast secondary beta-relaxation process in a glass, prior to the main structural relaxation which results in a double decay of the intermediate scattering functions (ISFs) in the ms time scale. Due to the low signal to noise ratio available at low Qs and short times scales, we could not characterize neither the wave-vector dependence of the beta-relaxation nor its evolution with temperature. For this purpose, we propose here to use the large coherent flux offered by XPCS at ESRF-EBS to probe for the first time the temporal evolution of the beta-relaxation in a MG across the glass-transition temperature. A successful experiment will deepen our understanding on the glassy dynamics from an extended scale and may unveil the physical origin for the recently reported string-like atomic motions in MGs.

Understanding the mechanisms behind mRNA-LNP formation is crucial for improving their design.

Previous multi-technique experiments, comprising Pt L3-edge XAS (CH-5204), revealed that Pt nanoparticles (NPs) restructure in the presence of H2 in the gas-phase; a similar behaviour is expected also for Ru, which is more reactive than Pt. Moreover, in a very recent high-energy XRPD\/PDF experiment (CH-6371), we found that both catalysts restructure in the presence of H2 also in liquid phase, at a short time-scale (1-2 min). Here we want to perform time-resolved Pt L3-edge and Ru K-edge XAS to collect complementary information on adsorbate-induced NPs restructuring, extending the interest from H2 to CO.

Currently, using speckle-based approaches, directional dark-field imaging is limited to projection, therefore providing only two-dimensional information. Current tensor-tomography techniques require tomographic data to be collected about multiple axes of rotation. Due to the two-dimensional sensitivity of speckle-based imaging, data is required about only two rotation axes, making it more dose efficient.

Our results provide information on the oxidation state of the cations upon cycling and on the structural mechanism of dopant incorporation and its effect on the de-\/lithiation mechanism. We aim to extend the reaction mechanism to Ru-doped CeO2. Remarkably, doping CeO2 with 15 at-% Ru provides the highest capacity among all metal-doped CeO2 anodes studied so far.

We found the laser-sample coupling to be critically dependent on the type of the diamonds, i.e IIas vs. Ia and, for one sample, we obtained temperatures of almost 2000 K with 60% of the maximum laser power. In this case, the T quenched material exhibited a small (about 5 micron) single crystal (SC) product, which we investigated via SC XRD and identified as a hexagonal phase, likely graphane, the DFT predicted thermodynamic extended phase for 1:1 CH stoichiometry.

We propose to study modified Fe(II)-polypyridine complexes, model systems for light-switchable molecular magnets, for which QC calculations suggest the feasibility of altering the excited state PES by ligand substitution. Transient optical absorption shows that the lifetime of the excited quintet state changes upon substitution, suggesting variation of the energy landscape.

Understanding the nano, micro and macrostructure is critical to understanding the tissue, however, imaging methods classically rely on isolating the tissue from its native environment to study its morphology. A different approach is using dark-field imaging and a multi-contrast strategy to study the contribution of the different components to the signal. We propose to use a high-energy small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography on a mouse limb. In this experiment, the direction of alignment and degree of orientation of the collagen fibrils and mineral platelets in the bone, collagen in tendons and ligaments, and keratin in nails and fur can be extracted in the 3D volume from their scattering\/diffraction signal. We believe the experiment will pave the way for understanding tissue organization in a more complete and multi length scale manner.","1584":"The prototypical perovskite SrTiO3, while being an incipient ferroelectric in bulk, is known to possess a\r\nstructural transition at 105 K, where subtle rotations of the oxygen octahedra double the cubic unit cell\r\nresulting in a tetragonal antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase. So far, relatively little attention has been paid to\r\nthe effect of biaxial strain on the AFD transition of strained SrTiO3 thin films, and if and how it interacts\r\nwith ferroelectricity. To understand these questions, we propose to perform cryogenic diffuse scattering\r\nexperiment at ID28 on SrTiO3 films grown under different amount of biaxial strain and on substrates of\r\ndifferent symmetry. This experiment requires the capability of the ID28 beamline at ESRF to capture a large\r\nvolume of the reciprocal space and detect the very weak scattering produced by the subtle oxygen rotations\r\nin the AFD phase.","1588":"Ex-situ high resolution tomography of pure Ni\/Ni-base superalloy weld","1589":"Imaging of part of the projectome in the visual-parietal-auditory cortex network ","1590":"Thermal annealing is widely known to improve the performance of organic semiconductor devices due to effects such as defect healing, side-chain reorientation\/ crystallization etc. However, its effect on thin film dissolution has not yet been investigated. In our study of several polymer semiconductors, we find that most materials exhibit a change in solvent after heating above a certain temperature. The location and width of the temperature window where this solvent resistance change occurs is different for different polymer semiconductors. With this experiment, we aim to investigate technologically relevant polymers in this material-specific temperature range and obtain important information on the changes in the crystalline phase. This data will complement other experimental data and help to draw a comprehensive picture of the changes in the semi-crystalline thin film morphology that leads to the drastic changes in the dissolution behavior upon thermal post-treatments.","1591":"scanning diffraction tests on palygorskite clay minerals","1592":"Layered Ni-rich lithiated metal oxides such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) are attractive candidates as next-generation Li-battery (LiB) positive electrode materials due to their high capacities and reasonable price. Unfortunately, the cycle life of these materials is relatively short due to structural instability. However, the loss in performance over time can be retarded by either bulk or surface Zr-doping. The goal of this experiment is to perform in-operando HE-XRD on different Zr-doped and undoped electrodes in aged assembled Swagelok cells to understand the exact role and behavior of the dopant in the host NMC structure after 100 cycles.","1596":"Na-based solid-state batteries (SSBs) offer high energy density and safety, which are among the main goals of current battery research. Unlike Li-SSBs, it is not possible to use Na-metal electrodes, so a novel carbon framework structure is used as the anode, which prevents direct contact with the highly Na+ conducting sulfur solid electrolytes (SE). However, Na-SSBs undergo large volume changes and this process is accompanied by cracking, especially at the interfaces. In this study, we will use in-situ synchrotron computed tomography (SCT) to study novel Na-SSBs as a function of pressure to get inside local volume changes and resulting cracks, displacements that are often associated with plating\/stripping of Na. Of particular interest is the question of the reversibility of these processes. These questions can only be answered by SCT, as other methods are either destructive and\/or don't allow such high pressures.","1597":"The Bragg coherent modulation imaging methodology (BCMI) for measuring highly strained nanocrystal has been successfully demonstrated but lack of applications.

These chaetae are specialized bristles that are involved in locomotion, defense, and other functions. These bristles are composed of a mineralized structure that is formed through the process of biomineralization. Not much research has been performed to date on the structure and mineralization of the chaetae. We have preliminary revealed that the mineral is organized in a beautiful 3D hexagonal packing along the fibers and that other than calcite various unknown mineral phases exist.      Herein we propose to study the 3D structural organization along the fiber via SAXS\/WAX on the microdiffrcation beamline ID13 as well as the mineral composition lattice strains in the mineral on ID22.

Three-dimensional coherent X-ray diffraction patterns will be used to image the hydrogen-induced strains and domains. We will quantify the time-dependent lattice parameter and strain-induced during hydrogen charging. This will be combined with thermal desorption spectroscopy spectra collected ex-situ to understand the diffusion mechanisms during hydrogen absorption. In addition, we will compare the effect of hydrogen charging time and Fe ion irradiation on the defects-assisted HE formation mechanism within Fe and Fe-Cr microcrystals. Such a systematic study using model systems such as Fe and Fe-Cr will unravel the role of alloying elements in slowing down HE in steels.

Upon inhibition, the enzyme is covalently modified and the\r\nnerve agent is completely destroyed. Recently, human BChE has been the target of the development of new molecules for the treatment of the late stage of\r\nAlzheimer's disease. We propose to determine the structures of human BChE in complexes with such ligands.

The main collaborative research fields are tackling Ras protein signaling with structure-guided ligand design, developing inhibitors of the Ras-binding protein PDEd, screening of a novel sp3-enriched fragment library or targeting genetic regulators. Cellular signaling will also be addressed through the structural analysis of deubiquitinating enzymes or regulators of the kinetochore. Finally, we plan to crystallize membrane proteins including GPCRs in order to understand their biological function, characterize their ligand specificity and develop novel regulators.","1603":"The methane-to-methanol conversion is seen as one of the \"holy grail\" reactions of catalysis. One extensively examined pathway is the chemical looping\r\napproach using copper-exchanged zeolites. Copper-exchanged zeolite omega has outperformed all other examined copper-zeolites in multiple metrics such as productivity. Further increases may be envisaged by increasing the copper-loading or modifiyng the zeolite framework to exhibit a hierarchical pore structure. However, besides potentially destabilizing the framework, a change in the nature of the reaction as well as the active site is possible. \r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to investigate the stability of the long-range structure of the system and pinpoint the changes in the local order of copper-active sites under different conditions.

The disease progression is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in the hepatic cells and hence by uncontrolled alterations of the hepatocytes. This proposal aims to morphologically characterize human liver tissues of bariatric patients by X-ray nano-holotomography. Thanks to its high spatial and contrast resolution capabilities, the nano-tomographic approach will enable to observe and evaluate hepatocytes inner structures and their 3D distribution with sub-cellular resolution.

These remarkable properties arise from a unique composition, including varying magnesium distribution and amorphous material. By subjecting the spines to mild heat treatments, previous research showed changes in flexibility, suggesting the role of compositional variations. Our proposed study employs nanotomography and in-situ annealing to track temperature-induced alterations in spine morphology and microstructure. Detecting density changes may reveal the crystallization of amorphous particles and shed light on non-uniform magnesium distribution.

Those steels are used to manufacture pressure vessels or piping, and is likely to occur in the development of promising technologies close to the carbon neutrality such as the power to gas and biomass retreatments. HTHA leads to the formation of cavities full of methane in depth of the material. As ageing in hydrogen atmosphere progresses the cavities grow and coalesce until cracking occurs. The mechanical strength of the steels is thus reduced (high risk of rupture). It is necessary to understand the origin of HTHA at the early stages, and to predict the evolution of the cavities in order to prevent accidents. High resolution X-ray tomography is the most suitable technique to characterize the small cavities (size and localization) at the early stages of the attack.

Zirconium based ceramics might be used as storage material, because their natural analogues zircon, ZrSiO4, and zirconia, ZrO2, are known to remain stable in geological cycles up to approximately 2\u00b710E9 years. We intend to investigate the structural substitution of thorium in Y-stabilized ZrO2 ceramics. Th(IV) is selected for this study because it represents the typical oxidation state IV which appear in Pu, U and Th containing nuclear waste. The aim of this study is to determine to what extend Th(IV) can be introduced into zirconium ceramics without Zr\/Th phase separation.","1612":"We are going to perform total scattering experiments with sp2-carbon-linked 2D c-COFs in order to reveal its structure.

Using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) on the superstructure diffraction peak that appears in the 475 K to 600 K temperature range we aim to spatially resolve the origin of the charge ordering in a Cobalt Oxyborate. Is this somehow related to defects on the crystal? Additionally, we want to investigate whether this superstructure appears homogeneously throughout the entire crystal or if there are islands of charge-ordered states. This experiment will be useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms of charge ordering and designing new quantum materials with desired properties.","1621":"We will investigate the coupling between strain and the metal-insulator phase transition (the Verwey transition) in the canonical compound, magnetite. We have shown (HC-4565) that strain caused by lattice imperfections affects the transition temperature, TV as the externally induced strain does. We have also proved before existence of the electronic phase separation below TV that certainly causes some intrinsic strain. Eventually, the low T phase does posssess natural crystallographic domains, i.e. also strain that may affect the transition. A picture of the extent and location of these strains, as well as their link with the transition temperature is clearly missing.

In this proposal, we aim to investigate the effect of the Pt surface structure on catalytic performance during cyclic voltammetry. Open questions remain regarding the mechanism and the kinetics of adsorption during the hydrogen oxidation reaction on the different Miller indexed surfaces of Pt. Using stroboscopic Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI), we intend to map in situ, the three-dimensional evolution of the deformation\/strain field of multi-faceted Pt nano-crystallites as a function of applied potential. This will yield the 3D strain map at millisecond timescales during the cyclic voltammetry process. Real time fast scans will inform on sample degradation at high potentials with a temporal resolution of <20 s. his experiment will complement previous studies carried out at ID01 beamline.","1623":"We observed in our capped Nd0.95Sr0.05NiO2 thin films a photo-induced resistance downturn. We plan to perform resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\r\nexperiments at the Ni-L3 edge under UV light, to discriminate interfacial effects from the \u2018pure\u2019 multiorbital nature of the electronic structure of infinite-layer\r\nnickelates. The idea is to use both -0.6 eV energy-loss spectral feature and magnons properties (energy and damping), as an indirect proxy to the possible\r\nsuperconducting state of the system under UV illumination. According to our experience on the system we can expect under UV an intensity decreases and\r\nsmearing out of those features. In this way, we will demonstrate that a superconducting state can be stabilized in infinite-layer nickelate thin films, as a result of\r\nphoto-induced modification of the charges in the two-orbital-channels describing the superconductivity in this system, hence, excluding a priori interfacial effects.","1624":"Pressure solution creep (PSC) is a major deformation mechanism in the Earth\u2019s upper crust that constrains geophysical processes and the performance of\r\nhydrogen and CO2 storage reservoirs. PSC occurs in fluid-saturated granular media (e.g., halite, calcite, or quartz grains) through dissolution of minerals at\r\nparticle contacts, transport of minerals through fluid-filled pores, and deposition of minerals onto grain surfaces. Despite extensive study, many uncertainties\r\npersist regarding the appropriate relationships between local stresses, local dissolution\/precipitation rates and global creep rates. The purpose of the proposed\r\nwork is to provide the first simultaneous measurements of contact-scale stresses driving dissolution, grain-scale shape changes resulting from precipitation, and\r\nsample-scale creep rates during the PSC process in small packings of halite grains by using x-ray tomography (XRT), 3D x-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and scanning\r\n3DXRD (s3DXRD).","1625":"Full-physical synthesis of metal nanoclusters below 3 nm in size holds the promise to deliver ligand-free clusters that are active for catalytic or (bio)photonic applications. Stabilization of the smallest clusters in laser-induced fragmentation remains a challenge, if ultrapure colloid from laser ablation without any surfactants is used. We introduced graphene oxide (GO) as non-passivating agent (report to SC5265). In the first experiment an influence on the fragmentation at high laser fluence was found. This change is explained as caging effect rather than inhibition of cluster ripening. Therefore, it is proposed to block agglomeration via direct adsorption of the initial colloid on GO by electrostatic screening prior to fragmentation.","1626":"Bioprinting is a promising process to provide hospitals with tissue substitutes mimicking any organ without having to resort to donors. During bioprinting, a cell-encapsulating hydrogel, also known as bioink, is deposited layer by layer to ultimately develop a tissue substitute. An alginate\/gelatine\/fibrinogen hydrogel will be used for its shear thinning properties, biocompatibility, bioresorbability and shape fidelity after printing. Due to printing, polymer macromolecules composing the hydrogel have a local orientation inducing anisotropic mechanical properties in the printed object. Printing parameters have an effect on this anisotropic microstructure but the phenomenon is not yet controlled in the bioprinting process. Thus, the novelty of this proposal is to study this phenomenon using the in situ Small-Angle (SAXS) and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) scanning approach to visualise the orientation of hydrogel macromolecules during extrusion.","1627":"Competition exists in the high temperature cuprate superconductors between the superconducting (SC), pseudogap and ordered charge density wave (CDW)\r\nstates. A key doping level for understanding these competitions has been the 1\/8 doping level, where an anomaly in the superconducting dome occurs (e.g., La2- xBaxCuO4), that is concomitant with a first order structural phase transition and is understood to supress 3D superconductivity. However, very recently we have shown that this structural phase transition does not run to completion, suggesting a natural explanation for the persistence of only 2D (in plane) SC at the 1\/8 anomaly. We propose to carry out a diffraction resolved tomography experiment on a surrogate system to map out how the structural domains associated with the suppression of the 3D superconducting state percolate.","1628":"Due to thermal decomposition, the liquid structures of salts and salt-rich DESs are inaccessible.

Nevertheless, no direct observation of the putative Co(IV), or the Co(II\/III)-OOH species has been made under operando conditions to date. Time-resolved Co K-edge XAS with the fast monochromator of ID24 will provide crucial oxidation and spin state information of the cobalt ions (XANES) as well as coordination environment information (EXAFS) in the few seconds range after an electrochemical potential bias is applied to a well-defined Co3O4 precatalyst.\r\n","1633":"Beamline ID-29 offers unique opportunities for time-resolved structural biology in the microsecond regime and - because of the small focus - for the use of\r\nsmall crystals for e.g. faster diffusion of ligands.

As the DMAC polymerise, the hydrophobic block solvency worsens and, at some monomer conversion, nucleation occurs to form latently degradable nanoparticles. Given the highly asymmetric copolymer composition at this point, we predict that (i) the initial nuclei should be vesicles (rather than the spheres observed for conventional PISA syntheses) and (ii) there should be an unprecedented evolution in particle morphology from vesicles to worms to spheres as the DMAC polymerise to full conversion.","1650":"Injectable hydrogels are desired in many biomedical applications due to their minimally invasive deployment to the body and their ability to release drugs. However, current injectables suffer from mechanical mismatch with tissue, fragility, water expulsion, and high viscosity. To address these issues, we designed novel brush-like macromolecules that concurrently provide softness, firmness, strength, fluidity, and swellability. The aim of the proposed experiment is to explore the correlations between the structure and thermal properties as well as changes in structure during swelling of injectable hydrogel platform based on hydrophilic thermosensitive linear-bottlebrush-linear (LBL) triblock copolymers that self-assemble at body temperature. The in-situ SAXS coupled with weighting and variable-temperature experiments will help us understanding the evolution of the microstructural organization and its correlation to the swellability properties and temperature.","1651":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the pressure-induced modification of crystal lattice and electronic structure of two-dimensional V2CTz MXenes (Tz are = O and -Cl surface groups) by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Depending on the chemical etching environment, the exfoliated 2D MXene layers possess different surface functional groups and interlayer spacing defining their band structure and electronic properties. The fundamental question is how the surface functional groups and chemical bonding affect the band structure of 2D MXenes. Since pressure allows to change the interlayer distance, the van der Waals interaction and the electronic states, we propose to perform pressure-induced XANES studies at the K edges of transition metal and surface groups of functionalized V2CTz MXene single crystal in the 1-20 GPa. In such ground-breaking experiments, we expect a significant impact on the MXenes\u2019 electronic structure under applying pressure.

Our discovery reveals HEs can serve as secondary redox-active centers along side primary redox material LiFePO4, boosting cell capacity by several tens of percent. Leveraging chloride redox chemistry, approximately 50% of electrons are extracted during charging, with 25% recoverable upon discharge which is therefore presumably due to bulk modifications like phase transformation. Oxidation sees a rise in cell impedance and irreversible pressure decrease, hinting at significant structural changes in positive electrodes influenced by nearby conductive surfaces. We ask for Operando XRD-CT to reveal local 3D crystallographic changes, aiding in understanding electrochemical mechanisms.","1654":"Despite having a rich structural complexity and an unusual electron band configuration, cerium (Ce) has only been studied up to 208 GPa, using energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction techniques. We propose to perform angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements on Ce metal, obtaining high-quality compression data to at least 300 GPa. Preliminary work conducted by our group has indicated that the c\/a ratio of the body-centred tetragonal (bct) phase stable above 12 GPa starts to decrease above 200 GPa. We have also seen abnormal compressive behaviour at pressures above 250 GPa, which may be a result of shear stress effects or pressure gradients. These data were acquired using a relatively large ~2\u00b5m FWHM beam, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. We therefore aim to repeat this experiment using the superior facilities at ID27.

Many of these\r\ncomponents reach their \u201cend of life\u201d stage prematurely due to our inability to repair them. This\r\nproblem is especially wasteful and uneconomic because such components, particularly turbine\r\nblisks, use high-strength and high-cost Ni-based superalloys. Such material requires special tooling\r\nand consumes a significant amount of energy during the original manufacturing process. Repairing\r\ndamaged aerofoils can save ~ 45% in terms of carbon footprint and ~ 36% of the total energy when\r\ncompared to replacement with a new aerofoil [1]. The energy and cost savings are much higher for\r\nturbine blisks, where the whole blisk needs to be replaced even if a single aerofoil is damaged.","1656":"This proposal aims to characterize a selected metal-organic framework (MOF), namely bipyridine modified UiO-67, containing exposed Cu cations by operando\r\n XAS during the liquid-phase oxidation of cyclohexane\/cyclohexene to oxygenated products.

They have attracted much attention for various practical applications in particular for post-combustion capture of flue gas emitted from power plants. We propose the in-situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study of CO2 uptake by the novel ultra-microporous heterometallic Cu-based MOF. The chains of the latter coordinate water, which upon the activation (above 230 C) create active open metal sites capable to attract CO2 at relatively low pressures with a total uptake comparable with some of the benchmark MOFs reported to date. The PXRD will allow to investigate the crystal structure response\/flexibility of MIP-212(Al-Cu) to the CO2 loading which will help us to model the sorption mechanism using the computational methods.","1661":"The goal of this experiment is to use X-ray imaging techniques to enhance the understanding of grown brain tissue cultures (\u201corganoids\u201d).

However, standard imaging methods are insufficient to understand their growing process and architecture.\r\nX-ray nano-holotomography (XNH) can reveal the 3d-anatomy of brain organoids, to access the spatial distribution of cells and further characteristics related to tissue-growing. The here-presented XNH-data have been collected at the ID16A-beamline. Being sensitive to the electron density using XNH, we do not only identify cells in general with distinct grayvalues, but have also access to the chromatin packing and through that, potentially, to the sequencing activity. In order to better understand this signal and to access the chromatin conformation in greater detail, we want to do correlative small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on 2d-sections.","1663":"Since the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of the mRNA vaccines, RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles have emerged as an efficient delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics. Recently we have developed new formulations of lipoplexes (i.e. complex multilamellar vesicles) which are a promising tool for NA-based therapeutic delivery systems. This proposal aims to study the internal structural organization of the lipoplexes by varying several parameters: : type of nucleic acid used (pDNA, mRNA, siRNA, ASO), process parameters, lipid composition (especially the influence of ionizable lipids), and environmental parameters (temperature and pH). Synchrotron-SAXS will allow us to accurately characterize the multilamellar organization of the lipoplexes, which is challenging with other methods. The results will provide insight into the complex structure of lipoplexes and contribute to the development of improved delivery systems for mRNA and other NA therapeutics.","1664":"Incomplete macromolecular mixing and (re-)entangling across weld interfaces cause inferior weld mechanics transverse to the print direction. As solution we have proposed interfacial stereocomplex (SC) crystallization, but the increased mechanical activation energy of SC-PLA entails mechanical embrittlement. We synthesized new copolymers that upon melt crystallization give enhanced control of ductility via phase separation and interfacial SC crystallization. By combining a nanofocused beam and fast scanning chip calorimeter giving submicron spatial and msec temporal resolution, we aim to answer the question how molecular and blend composition, phase separation in the melt, and cold crystallization during heating in pre-recorded printing profiles direct morphology evolution and later mechanical performance.","1665":"Inconel 718 is an alloy used in critical components in the aero-engine industry and energy sector that has high performances characteristics at high temperature\r\nand load.

This system draws attention because of its potential as sub-nanometer thin insulator layer for  metal\/silicon junctions. In the literature, although several chemical and the electronic properties have been investigated, there is no consensus on the atomic structure of this interface. The high computational requirements still prevent the simulation of whole structure because of the large number of atoms participating in the 8x8 supercell. The precise identification of the atomic positions constituting the interface can be relevant for the understanding of the electronic band structure, a first step towards the exploitation of this interface in future electronic devices.

While recent developments in \u00bfomics\u00bf opened a window of the complexity of this world, it is still problematic to attribute a function to a gene product or predict enzymatic reactions simply from its sequence. Then, how can enzymes be studied from uncultivated microbes? In this proposal, we are using an explorative approach to open a new field: the structural elucidation of catabolic enzymes from microbial mesocosms. We will study two models, an anaerobic bioreactor containing a methane-degrading consortium, and a microbial community from wastewater treatment. As a proof of concept, we recently isolated, crystallized, and structurally characterized the methane-generating enzyme from an archaeon living in this activated sludge. Now, we will go beyond and isolate more enzymes of catabolic pathways from these \"microbial dark matter\", playing a key role in the carbon cycle.","1670":"Near-equiatomic TiNi alloys with thermoelastic martensite transformations, shape memory effect and superelasticity are used in engineering and medicine. However, when applied, the alloys reveal hydrogen embrittlement, corrosion, influence of absorbed hydrogen on their martensite transformations and functional properties. Currently, it is not understood how the hydrogen diffusion into TiNi is influenced by material residual strain distribution and local microstructure. The aim of this DFXM experiment is to perform the first in-situ characterization of hydrogen loading into a coarse-grained TiNi and quantify changes in intragranular (compressive) strain distribution, mosaicity and (indirectly also) in the formation of B19 and hydrides phases during in-situ electrochemical loading.

The presence of unconventional superconductivity on the thin films makes these materials 2D analogs of the cuprates. However, important differences exist, one of them being the layer interface proximity properties, which can result, for example, in different substrate-induced strains. The understanding of these properties can lead to material design for applications, by manipulating layers and proximity effects.\nFor this inhouse, we will test the effect of using the Razorbill Ultraminiature UHV strain cell on the measurement of the spectroscopic signatures of Ni L3 edge for a PrNiO2 (PNO) thin film.

Indeed, Fe- and Ni-based alloys are corroded in contact with molten salts and often display intergranular corrosion. To solve this urgent concern, one needs to understand corrosion mechanisms and kinetics, especially the evolution of grain boundaries (GB). To do so, we want to monitor corrosion in situ by using 3D X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and tomography (PCT). These experiments will be coupled with ex situ 3D diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) and scanning XRD (SXRD) before and after corrosion to access higher spatial resolution and retrieve a multiscale overview of corrosion in molten salts.","1730":"Ex-situ samples for high throughput XRD","1732":"We will apply Bragg coherent diffraction imaging to characterise the structure of metallic particles.","1733":"The proposed work will apply x-ray scanning micro-diffraction (\u03bcXRD) and x-ray micro fluorescence imaging (\u03bcXRF) to histological sections of human brain tissue to map the distribution of fibrillar aggregates of these proteins and the correlated abnormal deposition of specific elements in or around plaques and tangles.

We have recently shown that tertiary and quaternary structural changes can be followed in T.  thermophilus (Tt) CarH after light absorption by time-resolved small and wide angle X-ray scattering (Exp. LS-2958). We propose to extend the results of LS-2958 to both a variant and a homolog of TtCarH, where major quaternary changes are prevented. The new results will be essential to disentangle tertiary and quaternary signals in TtCarH thus enabling us to describe the cascade of structural events occurring in native TtCarH in the micro- to millisecond time scale.","1966":"In this proposal we aim to investigate the 3D modulation of Mg in calcitic biomineralized tissues of the red algae. We have found\r\nvia aberration corrected HRTEM that varying concentrations of Mg exists within these biominerals in an alternating manner. However EDS in TEM is  not near as sensitive as XRF and cannot pick up small varientions. Moreover, TEM cannot reveal 3D modulations but mainly only 2D small slices. We would like for the first time to study these modulations in 3D. These modulations have implications in understanding the process of biomineralization (transformation of a Mg-rich amorphous precursor to a crystalline phase) as well as have strong affects on the mechanical properties. Such unprecedented 3D structural information due to nanotomography imaging coupled with Mg XRF will make it possible, for the first time, to localize the elemental distributions within the sample in 3D.","1967":"Long term interim storage until a deep geological dispocal facility becomes operational is currently the end of life solution for spent Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) fuel.

Under these wet conditions, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) has been observed on the cladding of some fuel pins, jeopardizing the containment of radioactive material inside the cladding.\r\nResidual stress in the cladding, caused by Pellet-Cladding Interaction (PCI) is suspected to be the driving force behind the SCC. The nature and magnitude of these stresses, and the quantity of affected fuel pins are currently unknown.\r\nFor this purpose, the Incremental Centre Hole Drilling (ICHD) technique is being adapted for application on AGR fuel.

Synthesis and study of specifically designed adsorbents for their efficient capture is mandatory. The MOF [Zr6O4(OH)6(H2O)2(TBAPy)2(PhTz)]Br obtained incorporating [PhTz]Br in [Zr6O4(OH)8(H2O)4(TBAPy)2] (NU-1000) [1] and having the same 3D framework shows temperature-dependent selectivity, adsorbing more N2O at 298 K, more CO2 at lower temperatures. GCMC simulations of its adsorption isotherms suggest that CO2 and N2O interact with PhTz+ in end-on and side-on mode, respectively. In situ PXRD on both MOFs at different temperatures a) dosing CO2 or N2O in static conditions will allow clarifying the role of PhTz+ suggested by the calculations and rationalizing the observed temperature-dependent selectivity; b) flowing a CO2\/N2O mixture with the atmosphere v\/v ratio and coupling MS on the exit flow will allow establishing if PhTz+ is involved and the selectivity is temperature-dependent also in dynamic conditions.","1969":"This proposal will continue the work on novel P coated with polysulfides","1970":"We are planning to perform an in-house experiment using near-field ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (NF-PXCT) on megasclere of a marine sponge species S. ponderosus.

Recently, transition metal oxide catalysts containing boron have gained attraction for their high catalytic activity in OER. We aim to investigate the structure-property relations of different Co\/Ni-B oxides for OER. We focus on the structure evolution of these highly active catalysts on the atomic scale, starting from amorphous precursors via intermediate structures to crystalline materials by in situ total scattering experiments and subsequent pair distribution function analysis.

We would like to see how they perform under real brazing: in particular the integrity of the interface with the substrate (presence of cracks or not) and when and how pores occur in the joint, because these are key points for their potential use for industrial applications. The number and the localization of pores are important since a certain level of pores can help for residual stress relief in the joint, but too many of them can lead to dramatic failure; the thermal expansion coefficient of the solder alloy has been chosen to be very close to that of the most used substrates, but the evolution of the microstructure at high temperature and the formation of intermetallics can be prohibitive for service life. It is thus crucial to carry out in situ X-ray microtomography during heating and cooling\/solidification to detect the presence of pores and cracks in the solder joints.","1981":"The blackening of red cinnabar pigment is a major problem of conservation for the artworks containing it.

A nuclear magnetic resonance study discovered a hidden order below TO ~ 155K without any evidence of apparent symmetry breaking. Furthermore, our preliminary resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) results revealed an incommensurate magnetic instability well correlated with the ordering temperature from magneto-transport, TN ~ 55K and coexisting with the superconductivity. We conjecture the stripe order gives a way to the formation of incommensurate order and ultimately the hidden order by frustration between V and Fe.

In this tetragonal system, a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) order sets in before a structural transition to a triclinic phase occurs. We have recently performed a combined diffuse scattering (DS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) study in BaNi2(As,P)2, in which we have identified the soft phonon responsible for the formation of the IC-CDW.

In a recent synchrotron-XRF study performed at the ESRF, we found that Co and Cr released from arthroplasty implants integrate into peri-implant bone. However, it remains elusive whether metal integration into bone directly alters bone tissue homeostasis. Osteocytes are located in the lacunar network of the bone and are major regulators of bone tissue homeostasis. Thus, the proposed project aims to perform nanoCT analyses of human ex vivo specimens to systematically investigate the influence of metal exposure on osteocyte lacunae and the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network. Nano-resolution and a high sample throughput are mandatory to better understand the role of the osteocyte-network in the disturbed mineral homeostasis.

When processed by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), an additive manufacturing (AM) technology, high-strength Al alloys show sharp hot-crack sensitivity. A common approach to overcome this problem relies on the use of Ti- and Zr-based inoculant phases to form fine equiaxed grains to better accommodate solidification strains. Ti and Zr modify severely the aging behaviour of the alloys, thus new heat treatment routes have to be designed. Here we plan to perform in-situ time-resolved XRD analyses on Al-Cu-Mg-Zr and Al-Cu-Mg-Ti-B alloys to investigate the microstructure and precipitate evolution following different heat treatment routes. Residual strain mapping will be also performed at RT on the same materials after different annealing schedules.

How their anatomy adapted to this extreme environment is a key evolutionary biology question. In particular, the structure of their bones is proposed to be peculiar to deal with water pressure and the scarcity of resources, but this has not been properly tested because no comparative framework exists on the matter. In this proposal, we aim at building such a framework of comparative fish bone microstructure across deep-sea teleost diversity. We will use established quantitative methods based on \u00b5CT data, to compare bone compactness in a broad range of species. This requires acquiring 3D microtomographic data with enhanced contrast and at a high-throughput, conditions that are ideally met at the ESRF BM18 or BM05 beamlines.","2088":"Local Ytrium speciation and local environment in Fluoro-apatite","2095":"Knowledge of Cr redox state in crop plants is fundamental to assess potential Chromium (Cr) toxicity to human beings. XAS is an ideal probe to determine the oxidation state of Cr in plant matrix. We propose to use High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) to characterize the speciation of Cr in plants samples with \u201cnatural Cr levels\u201d collected from laboratory experiments. The objective is to fill the gap in fundamental knowledge of the Cr speciation in plants at low but environmentally-relevant range of concentrations. Indeed, it is well known that plant can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), but our preliminary results achieved on a single sample tend to show that plant can also reduce Cr(III) to Cr(0). This result is new and need to be confirmed on a larger set of plant samples.

We aim to probe the degradation mechanism of Gr-Si anode cycled at different C-rates in long- and short-structure ranges.  The proposed experiments are under the umbrella of the Big-Map and BATTERY 2030+ projects.","2101":"Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is an important metastable phase involved in the biomineralization processes used by organisms to form their skeletal parts.  Although the pigmentation mechanisms are yet poorly known, color changes were observed from red, when the coloring polyhydroxylated naphthoquinone (PHNQ) molecules are synthesized in the cells to dark purple when they are occluded within the calcite phase. We propose that pH plays a crucial role in these color changes as the PHNQ\u2019s protonation state leads to color from red to blue.  Similarly, the analogue molecules (naphthazarin and juglone) we plan to use in this study, change color according to pH. Thus, we aim at measuring the local structural rearrangement occurring during the crystallization of ACCs synthesized at different pH (8-12.6) in the presence of the pigment molecules. This, will evidence the synergic role of pH and pigment\u2019s ionic form on ACC stability and crystallization pathways.","2104":"Ptychography tests on pearl nacre","2105":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","2106":"The major bottleneck for large-scale application of  methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) process is catalyst deactivation, which is caused by a.o. coke formation. Our previous results showed that adding H2O as co-reactant during the MDA reaction, results in a prolonged stability of the Mo\/ZSM-5 catalyst. However, there is still a knowledge gap on the effects of H2O on the structure and performance of the active Mo species and the zeolite framework during the reaction. The proposed operando XAS\/XRD characterization study will yield new information on both the evolution and stability of the Mo sites (with XAS), and structural changes within the zeolite framework (with XRD) upon co-feeding various H2O concentrations. ","2107":"The structural changes of graphene oxide as a function of relative humidity will be investigated by PDF technique. The powder sample will be confined in a capillary where the humidity will be controlled by an external device with a N2 flow.\r\nThis experiment is going to complete a set of data performed in May (SC-5225).","2109":"The high-pressure chemistry and physical properties of rare earth metal nitrides are almost unknown.\r\nWe demonstrated that even at moderate compression (~50 GPa) yttrium and nitrogen form a novel\r\ncompound, Y5N14, with a new structural type and with three differently charged [N2]x- dimers. Theoretical\r\nstudies predict the formation of exotic yttrium polynitrides near 100 GPa. Here, we propose a single-crystal\r\nX-ray diffraction (SCXRD) study of the Y-N system at pressures up to 175 GPa at ID27. The aims of the\r\nproposed experiments are a synthesis of new Y-N compounds at multimegabar pressure, characterization of\r\ntheir crystal chemistry and compressional behavior, tests of theoretical predictions, and search for\r\nregularities in polynitrogen chemistry.","2111":"Perovskites, with general structure ABO3, are a promising class of catalytic materials, as they can be easily synthesized from a variety of abundant and non-toxic materials. Among them, Pt - CaTi(1-x)Fe(x)O3 perovskites are found to be good materials for the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), showing relative good conversion even at RT. \r\nPreliminary results shows that the catalytic performances in this type of catalyst are strongly influenced by the presence of water vapor in the gas feed showing an overall higher conversion. \r\nThe experiment aims to get a better understanding of the reaction mechanism is such type of materials when the reaction is run in presence of water vapor.  We will acquire In situ HERFD XANES for Pt L3 edge and HERFD XANES and XES Fe, Ti, Ca K-edge for Pt-CaTi(1-x)Fe(x)O3 having different Fe loading (Fe form 0.1 to 0.4).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","2113":"Glasses are amorphous systems extremely common in our everyday life. Being in a metastable state, they have 'memory' of their history and can be produced in very different ways. With this proposal we want to explore the effect of x-ray irradiation on some prototypical glasses following their structural changes through x-ray diffuse scattering. We will study systems irradiated with different photon energies, investigating the effect of radiolysis and knock-on events.","2114":"The development of after-treatment catalysts for internal combustion engines remains of great importance. This is because, despite the shifting focus to more carbon-neutral technologies, there is a growing demand for diesel cars in developing countries as well as a high demand for heavy-duty trucks.\r\nOver the last 20 yeasr, Cu-CHA catalysts have dominated the aftertreatment technology market for diesel exhaust systems. With upcoming legislation putting restriction on levels of N2O - a greenhouse gas - for the first time, the low N2O formation on Fe-modified zeolites make them particularly desirable for new technologies. There is, however, some way to go before Fe-modified zeolites can measure up to Cu-CHA, particularly in the low temperature window.\r\nUnderstanding the active Fe species required for low temperature SCR reactivity is paramount to developing the new technologies. The speciation information obtained by HERFD-XANES measurements will provide this much needed insight.","2116":"The aim of this project is to study the evolutionary origin of metamorphosis in the amphibian lineage. Lissamphibians (i.e., salamander, frogs, and caecilians) are the only extant tetrapods that metamorphose, but it is still not clear whether metamorphosis is unique of this clade or if it evolved during the Palaeozoic in their putative ancestors, the dissorophoid temnospondyls. To date, metamorphosis cannot be inferred unequivocally for this fossil group because of the lack of complete ontogenetic series. In this project, we propose to infer metamorphosis in temnospondyls in a novel way: testing whether their palatal bones show histological signals of remodelling, a process that occurs in pterygoids and vomers during metamorphosis in salamanders. To do so, we propose to study using synchrotron x-ray imaging the ontogenetic changes in cranial bones at the histological level in a range of salamander taxa with different life cycles and compare them to key temnospondyl species. ","2117":"This experiment searches for indications of the metabolic pathways, displayed by the trace metal contents, of exceptionally well-preserved 2 Ga old filamentous microfossils from Gabon. Trace metals will be quantified from nano-XRF images of both longitudinal and transverse FIB sections of the filaments (ES-1167 6 shifts @ ID16B in April 2022). Our present request is a new XANES measurement of 6 shifts on ID21 at Sulphur K-edge (E\u22482.5 keV) to complete the important step of demonstrating that Ni is linked to organic compounds. This study will form the basis for comparison with the oldest microfossils that utilize methane metabolism and will evaluate novel metabolism emergence, associated with the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE).

The motivation of this work is to find the reason behind the ferromagnetism in the single-atom (e.g. Fe, Co,\r\nNi, and Cu) doped TiO2, an unexpected property with no bulk analogue. These XES\/RIXS measurements can uniquely\r\ndetermine whether the observed magnetization is due to a magnetic moment from one of the constituent elements, or\r\ntheir orbital hybridization.","2121":"Identifying the chemical and structural changes of catalysts under reaction conditions is crucial in terms of understanding the catalytic mechanism and improves the process efficiency, which facilitates the next-generation catalysts design. In alloyed Cu nanoparticle system, the distribution of CO2 reduction products is closely related to the surface and near-surface catalyst composition. By controlling the atomic ratio in Cu alloys, the bond structure as well as the electronic properties can be tuned to affect the binding energy of CO2 reduction intermediates. Additionally, alloying also changes the surface strain and binding modes of intermediates regardless of the scaling relations. With this proposed in situ electrochemical Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) experiment, we aim to resolve the local strains of Cu alloys (Cu-Ag or Cu-Pd) with a resolution as low as 10 nm to identify the active phase during electrochemical CO2 reduction.","2122":"This experiment aims to study static recrystallization in Mg-Zn-Ca alloys using in-situ 3D X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). Lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloys have enormous potential for reducing fuel consumption of transportation vehicles, but the poor formability of Mg sheet due to its strong basal texture has precluded its widespread use. Recent studies on Mg-Zn-Ca suggest that annealing can result in desirably weakened split-basal textures. Here, we plan to use a multiscale, multimodal approach to understand the role of recrystallized versus non-recrystallized (i.e., grains that existed from the as-deformed condition). Our two-part experiment plan consists of (1) collecting non-recrystallized vs. recrystallized grain evolution statistics using fast acquisition 3DXRD in the rolling, normal, and transverse directions, and then (2) \"zooming\" in to measure the evolution of non-recrystallized vs. recrystallized grains in high resolution using DFXM.","2124":"All-inorganic halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells or LEDs. These materials have a high thermal stability and excellent optoelectronic properties, with easily tuneable band gaps. We are interested in studying the stability and the behaviour with temperature of the different compositions of Cs2-xRbxSnI6 and Cs1-yRbySnI3. These materials will be obtained via mechanochemistry, a simple and eco-friendly synthetic method. We are interested in collecting data from room temperature (RT) to 350\u00baC and back to RT as well as studying the stability and decomposition of the Cs1-yRbySnI3. We will study the phase transformations that the material undergoes with temperature and the decomposition paths of the perovskite into the vacancy ordered perovskite. We will analyse the data performing Rietveld refinements and maximum entropy analysis (MEM).","2126":"2D polymers have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their interesting electronic properties. One way to realize 2D polymer crystals with large domain size and high crystallinity is by surfactant-monolayer-assisted interfacial synthesis. In this proposal, we want to understand the precise role that the surfactant monolayers at the air-water interface play for the reaction dynamics of the 2D polymers. The final goal is to investigate the relation between different surfactant monolayers, the supramolecular pre-organization of monomers, and eventually the crystallinity of the 2D polymers under different surface pressure conditions.","2128":"Muscle contraction is regulated by both Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation and mechanosensing-based thick filament activation that switches ON the motors in relation to the load. Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in its central one-third and bridges thin and thick filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments, conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in specific proteins.","2133":"This proposal aims to study cobalt nanoparticles on different supports exposed to the FT reaction conditions using synchrotron X-ray techniques such as wideangle X-ray scattering (WAXS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). The focus will be on investigating well-defined cobalt FT catalysts, with particular attention to the cobalt particles sintering, their crystallographic structure, chemical coordination environment, and the impact of supporting material.","2134":"Mapping inhomogoeneities on hybrid lead halide perovskite thin layers at the nanoscale using XRD and XRF in EH3.","2139":"Lead Halide Perovskites (LHP) colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) easily self-assemble into ordered Superlattices (SLs) exhibiting uncommon collective emission properties (superfluorescence). LHP SLs also show atomic interference between NCs due to alignment of atomic planes, manifesting as multiple fringes of\r\nthe 100 \/ 200 (cubic notation) X-ray peaks in 1D WAXS patterns. In our ongoing research on the topic, we investigate possible interplay between structural interference and collective emissive properties. Here, we intend to perform high-resolution in-situ and ex-situ combined 2D GIWAXS\/specular diffraction experiments on fully inorganic \/ hybrid LHP NC SLs, aiming at: i) monitoring self-assembly from the early-stages taking place inside the colloidal suspension upon slow-solvent evaporation, to the final dried film, possibly exploring in-plane and out-of-plane atomic interference; ii) studying atomic interference in binary SLs grown ex-situ as sub-micrometer thick films.","2140":"The objective of this study is consequently to measure in situ the evolution of the macromolecular dynamics as a function of both stretching conditions and strain. To achieve this goal X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements will be carried out as this technique is one of the few allowing such in situ measurements of relaxation times from milliseconds to tens of seconds, i.e. in the timescale of the polymer macromolecular dynamics. Another objective of this work is to develop the XCPS measurement technique on the D2AM beamline (now possible due to the enhancement of the beam coherence thanks to the EBS upgrade).","2142":"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers with a prognosis for most patients of six-month survival period. This has encouraged the exploration of some organometallic complexes in this area. Recent research show  that often they target the mitochondrial system or inhibit kinases or redox proteins overexpressed in cancer cells. We have discovered  a succinimido-ferrociphenol iron-based compound with an exceptional antitumoral effect on various type of cancers, particulalrly pancreatic ones. We could also confirm its potential in vivo in glioma or murine xenografted-melanoma when it is loaded  in lipid nanocapsules. It is thus essential considering the pharmacological potential of this organometallic compound to understand the intracellular targets and pathway of this ferrociphenol in aggressive pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 cells. We expect to unravel it through 3D correlative optical fluorescence microscopy and X-ray fluorescence nanoimaging at ID16A.","2143":"PEMFC is a conversion device that uses the chemical energy of the O2\/H2 pair to produce electricity, heat, with water as a by-product. The\r\nmain component of the individual cells composing the PEMFC is the Membrane Electrode Assembly which is composed of a proton\r\nconducting polymer electrolyte membrane sandwiched between two electrodes. The electrode is a key and critical component, in terms of\r\ncost, performance and durability, as it is the place of the electrochemical reactions. The electrode is made of platinum nanoparticles (2-5 nm)\r\nsupported on electrically conductive mesoporous carbon particles (~30-50 nm) which are bound in a proton conducting polymer, the ionomer.\r\nThe proposed experiment aims at investigating the effect of solvent, catalyst and ionomer types on the ionomer nanostructure. This study will\r\nhelp for a better understanding of the influence of the fabrication process on the structure and dispersion of the ionomer in the electrode.","2144":"In this experiment, we aim at using X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT (XPCI-CT) for post-mortem imaging of healthy and glioblastoma-bearing brains after in-vivo treatment with synchrotron generated X-ray standard broad beams or Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT). The goal is to continue a study started before the ESRF-EBS shutdown and achieve the necessary statistical significance for the validation of the results obtained in the first experiments on both healthy and glioblastoma-bearing rats.\r\nResults showed, with a high level of details, the effects of the MRT treatment on the nervous and vasculature tissues at the animals\u2019 end of life (i.e. late-term radiotherapy effects). Furthermore, the quantitative assessment of tumour growth or regression was also possible on XPCI-CT images, but results show unclear behaviours due to inter-individual variability within a group that can be cleared up only by increasing the study statistics.","2145":"The aim of this BAG is the development of new methods, hardware and software for different applications in SSX. The new EBS machine is in the privileged position of exploiting flux density previously unmatched at synchrotron beamlines. The increase in photon flux density at the sample position will interest most of the MX beamlines and it is going to be particularly effective for microfocus beamline such as ID23-2 and ID30A3. We plan to further develop different SSX data collection methods and sample delivery devices in the attempt to profit of the characteristic of the new beam and to extend the implementation of automated procedures to simplify the access to SSX methods for the MX community. The methods developed will be eventually applied to the new ID29 ESRF beamline and similar projects under development at other European sources.","2146":"The early Permian Bromacker locality is central for studying the origin and evolution of tetrapod fossoriality. This site not only holds body fossils of plants, invertebrates and diverse tetrapods, but also a wealth of associated trace fossils, offering unprecedented insights into the ecology and behaviors of animals that died about 290 Ma. Of particular interest are among the oldest tetrapod burrows and associated scratch marks yet discovered. However, the identity of the burrow-makers remains uncertain. Similarly, the life history traits of Bromacker tetrapods have yet to be documented. The current project thus aims at better understanding the physiology of these species by means of virtual bone palaeohistology. In order to pinpoint the architects of these burrow structures, we will also investigate, using Synchrotron X-ray radiation imaging data, the morphological, biomechanical and microanatomical features that could be associated to a degree of fossoriality in these animals.","2149":"In the soft matter field, hematite microparticles are becoming increasingly important while their growth mechanism and their internal structure remain largely unknown. In particular, what determines the cubic shape of particles made of nanocrystals with uniaxial symmetry is still a mystery. In a recent successful experiment SC-5258, we looked at the diffraction patterns of single hematite microparticles using the microbeam setup where the whole particle was illuminated giving us information on the average internal structure. We now apply for a follow-up experiment using the nanobeam setup to probe different local areas of the particles separately. ","2150":"mEmerald is a GFP-derived fluorescent protein that showed a tendency to reversibly photoswitch between an \"on\" fluorescent state and an \"off\" non-fluorescent state under cryogenic conditions. It has been used to this purpose in super-resolution PALM imaging. Usually, reversibly switchable fluorecent proteins (RSFPs) photoswitch via the ci-trans isomerization of their chromophore. Such major reorganizations are prevented by cryogenic conditions and the efficient roomtemperature photoswitching of most of the existing RSFPs is abolished at low temperatures. mEmerald seems to be one of the rare exceptions but its photophysical mechanism remains to be elucidated. After having solved the high resolution 3D structure of the initial green-emiting form of the protein, I would like to solve the structure of photoswitched form at cryogenic temperature (100K), and correlate this structure with the corresponding absorption and\/or emission spectra either measured offline or, if possible, online.","2152":"Besides transverse and vortex magnetic domain walls, a third type of domain wall has been predicted, and observed in 2D in permalloy nanostrips.

We will use x-ray resonant diffraction to study the substitutional Fe doping of monoclinic CuO islands in epitaxy on SrTiO3(001). RXD, measured at the Fe K edge, allows to quantify the occupancy rate of the two cations on a same crystallographic site. At the same time GIXRD will allow to exclude the presence of spurious phases.","2157":"Genetic inactivation of the type II deiodinase gene (dio2) involved in thyroid signaling results in hypothyroidism and is associated with developmental defects in zebrafish. Observation of the heart region in this mutant contrasts strongly with that of a wild-type animal, suggesting a cardiac hypertrophy, a hypothesis supported by gene expression and immunological data.\r\nTo better characterize the morphological differences induced in zebrafish organs, in particular the heart, our aim is to use X-ray phase contrast technology on whole zebrafish to image body with sufficient resolution to obtain a good view of the morphology of the heart in dio2 mutants compared to wild type sibling fishes. Our goal is 1) to observe the heart in an in situ context and measure the volume, shape and position of the heart in these animals, 2) to determine the precise topography (e.g. barycenter analysis) of the organs relative to each other to assess the effects of the mutation on the whole animal.","2158":"Recently, we have systematically observed the presence of so far undescribed extensive number of canals in bone tissue that had previously been exposed to radiation therapy in the course of cancer treatment. While the existence of these canals is indisputable, their function or underlying mechanisms are fully unknown. Since bone remodeling was considered to be performed by osteoblasts and osteoclasts activities, and only recently the osteocyte network was included to actively and directly contribute in this process, it is surprising to now observe a new and to date undescribed canal system. The aim of this proposal is to study the potential junctions between the different pore networks (osteocyte-lacunar canalicular network vs. the newly found canal system) to proof if the different pore networks are independent from each other and to study the time of formation of these newly found canal pores. ","2165":"The electronic configuration of Cu (3d9) ions in low-dimensional cuprates is such that the electron hole is generally found in the eg 3d(x2-y2)-orbital instead of the 3d(3z2-r2). Remarkably, the quasi-1D Mott-insulator CuSb2O6 shows fairly regular CuO6 octahedra that seem to promote a close competition between the 3z2-r2 and x2-y2 levels that leads to a unusual orbital ordering with mixed character. This mixed character orbital ordering still lacks experimental cerification. Therefore, we propose to establish this unusual orbital ordering in CuSb2O6 by a series of momentum dependent RIXS experiments. Additionally, this unusual orbital configuration may provide new pathways for electron-phonon interaction in cuprates. Indeed, our group reported evidence by Raman scattering of low-energy electronic excitations in CuSb2O6 single crystals that strongly interact with phonons of similar energy that also lacks experimental verification by RIXS","2166":"studying hierarchical structure of human iPS cell-derived neural spheres by scanning x-ray microdiffraction","2167":"To reduce conventional fertilizer environmental inputs, foliar-applied nanoparticulate (NP) fertilizers are being developed. In addition to being more efficient, they will help avoid the contamination of agricultural soils in toxic elements found in conventional fertilizers. However, it remains unclear how foliar-applied NP fertilizers are assimilated into the leaves, and how the nutrients they deliver are used by the crops. Here, we designed a Fe based NP fertilizer to deliver Fe, a crucial nutrient that is often depleted in agricultural soils, and for which plants have developed two acquisition strategies. We propose to follow the fate of foliar-applied Fe from FeNP in two edible plants (tomato, type I, Fe redox-based and wheat, type II, Fe3+ complexation-based) using a multi-technique approach. By combining Fe K-edge XANES and EXAFS measurements with Fe isotopic measurements, we will track the pathways and mechanisms that affect Fe from foliar-applied FeNP fertilizer in our plants.","2169":"The glass transition is an out of equilibrium transition from the fluid to a disordered solid obtained at very high volume fractions. The glass transition is a dynamical arrested transition where colloids are trapped within the cage formed by their neighbors. The absence of rearrangement on long time scales leads to the solid behavior of the suspension. This transition has been well studied for hard-sphere colloids. Here, we aim to study this transition for fractal colloids, namely fumed silica dispersed in a good solvent. Preliminary results show that this system presents two originalities compared to hard-sphere colloidal systems. As the volume fraction is increased, the system viscosity diverges at low volume fraction, 30% and the colloids interpenetrate each other. Using SAXS and XPCS, we will systematically explore the structure and dynamics of fumed silica dispersion as a function of their volume fraction. We aim to unravel the role of interpenetration in glass forming liquids.","2170":"Syngas synthesis via reverse gas shift reaction is a promising approach to integrate CO2 in industrial processes. Insight into catalyst design is therefore required to develop highly active and selective catalysts that minimize side reactions, such as CO2 methanation. Potassium is an effective promoter for Cu-based catalysts, however, its promotional effect has not been fully elucidated, i.e. the nature of the Cu-K interaction and the reducing effect of K over Cu. The addition of K has led to greatly enhanced activity, selectivity and stability of the Cu catalysts during RWGS reaction, favouring syngas production. The unique capabilities of BM28\/ID26 beamlines allow us to study the evolution of oxidation state and atomic coordination of K and Cu in-situ as a function of the gas feed composition (% of H2) and support material (SiO2 or C). We aim to obtain detailed information concerning the K-Cu interaction, correlating it to the observed performances during RWGS reaction.","2171":"The autonomous construction of shelters using in-situ resources, such as via additive manufacturing (3D printing) of regolith feedstock, is a necessary prerequisite and priority to sustain longer duration human presence on the Moon from both a cost and risk perspective. Regolith processing strategies, however, are only as convincing as the simulants used to validate them. We aim to use powder diffraction data to generate the baseline fundamental description of high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants incorporating synthesised glasses and agglutinates, with a particular emphasis on phase evolution during sintering and recrystallization. Liquid presence sintering of matched site-specific compositions is investigated up to 1100\u00b0C.","2173":"We propose to measure the viscosity of liquids by means of microrheology-based X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS). In contrast to techniques using visible light, XPCS is not limited by the particle size. This allows measuring particle dynamics down to molecular length scales where many studies found indications for a violation of the Stokes-Einstein law in water. Thanks to recent advances in beamline and detector technology, and most importantly the synthesis of tracer particles with very narrow size distribution and tunable radius, precise measurements of viscosity will become possible with the required spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore, we plan to measure the dynamics of nm-sized particles in (1) water, (2) polymer melts and (3) liquid porphyrins.","2175":"Occurrence of solid\/solid phase transitions often affects the melting line and the properties of the corresponding liquid. In the case of Fe, the fcc-hcp-liquid triple point, around 100 GPa and 3500 K, is related to a change in the slope of the melting curve. This argues for possible changes in the physical properties of liquid Fe. Data collected in a previous XRD experiment intriguingly suggest a change in the compressibility of liquid Fe around the triple point. In order to confirm these preliminary observations, and relate this macroscopic behaviour to possible changes in the local atomic arrangement from a fcc-like to an hcp-like structure, we would need further data, in particular at P-T conditions above 100 GPa. We propose to probe the X-ray diffuse scattering signal of liquid Fe as a function of pressure above the triple point, so to confirm changes in the compressibility and further investigate the possibility of this to be due to modification of the local structure.","2177":" The Radiation Damage BAG investigates the fundamental mechanisms of radiation damage. It develops best practice data collection protocols to minimise radiation damage derived artefacts. It develops metrics and methods to track and quantify both global and local radiation damage.","2178":"The experiment will show the differences of electrode swelling in commercial lithium-ion batteries. The swelling of the electrode material is connected to the solid electrolyte interphase growth, which is a result of side reactions, which occur during the cell operation. Therefore, measuring the swelling of the electrodes enables the indentification of areas with higher and lower side reaction density, which will help to further improve state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Measuring of two idientical cells in fresh and aged state will add further information how cell-to-cell variations influence this side reactions. In total, this experiment will be one of the first approaches creating a kind of \u201cside reaction density\u201d map in commercial lithium-ion batteries.","2179":"Tubulin nucleation and microtubule (MT) assembly are frequent events in cells. To understand the fundamental mechanisms of MT assembly it is critical to resolve the early stages of the reaction, dictating the assembly pathway. Despite years of research, tubulin nucleation is still one of the least understood steps of MT dynamics, owing to the size of tubulin and its highly dynamic character. To determine the fundamental molecular-level mechanisms directing tubulin nucleation and the early assembly states, we will reconstitute in vitro a minimal model system that mimics the key elements of cytoskeleton MT assembly. We will use time-resolved solution small angle-X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) and our advanced analysis tools to follow in real-time, the active self-organization, dynamic structures, and bioenergetics of tubulin proteins and their regulation by fluxes of chemical energy, associated with nucleotide hydrolysis reactions. \r\n","2180":"Thanks to the progress in 2D materials technology, van der Waals (vdW) materials with outstanding magnetic properties can be synthesised nowadays by epitaxial methods down to the mono\/few layers.  However, substrate choice might lead to unwanted issues compromising the achievement of the desired properties. On the other hand, substrate engineering represents an ideal playground for understanding low-dimensional magnetism. Our preliminary XAS\/XMCD studies on the epitaxial Chromium diiodide, CrI2, monolayers (ML) grown by MBE on a metallic (gold) and an insulating (mica) substrate suggest respectively paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states at 4K, sometimes in contrast with early theoretical results.

BaZrO3 is a key material for several applications in broad fields due to its unusual properties; however, its structural stability under pressure still raises great doubts. This topic is considered a challenge, especially when related to the possible phase transition also at low temperature. The lack of detailed structural data along with the small amount of previous studies on the phase transitions of BaZrO3 makes this topic an interesting to be explored. Therefore, we propose here to study the phase transition under pressure Pm-3m to I4\/mcm in BaZrO3 perovskite and to probe its pressure-temperature phase diagram, considering runs at low temperature (10-300K) and high-pressure (0-1.2 Mbar). This will provide information on crystal structure stability of BaZrO3 perovskite.","2188":"Scanning spherulites of PLA stereocomplex with microfocused beam was done about 1 year ago.

This transition has been studied with rheology yet its dynamics is not well characterized. Here, using rheo-echo-XPCS, we aim to perform series of oscillatory strain experiments at constant strain amplitude in stationary conditions and construct stroboscopically, every oscillatory period, the intermediate scattering function (ISF) using XPCS. The analysis of the echo-ISF yield the dynamics of the colloidal dispersion as a function of the strain amplitude and the wave vector q. We expect to better understand the mechanisms at play as we increase the strain amplitude and reach the yield strain \u03b3y. In particular, is there an \u03b1 and \u03b2 brelaxation that accelerate as we approach gy.

During the nanotomography scanning, very small particles can be seen that allow for image correlation at high resolution inside the material and to identify strain heterogeneity up to fracture in link with the underlying grain structure.

The proposed work will apply x-ray scanning micro- and nano-diffraction to histological sections of human brain tissue in order to map the distribution and arrangement of fibrillar aggregates of these proteins in plaques and tangles.  The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that the spatial distribution of structural polymorphs  in brain tissue will provide important clues as to how fibrils contribute to disease.  The results of these studies will provide a preliminary assessment of whether or not different fibrillar polymorphs spread by a prion-like process during disease progression and provide insights into the mechanisms by which different strains are associated with different disease subtypes.","2196":"Nuclease has important application in modern therapy biotechnologies which, however, requires salt tolerant and active at a broad range of temperature.

By adjusting the composition of such spinels, the reducibility at low temperatures is significantly increased. The methanation of CO2 using nickel spinels has not yet been studied under operando conditions to correlate the structural changes to the catalytic properties. Here, the influence of manganese on the reduction process and its role in the reaction will be investigated. First, investigate in EXAFS\/XANES information on the evolution of the oxidation states and the local coordination environment of the metals (Ni and Mn) during reduction and catalysis. We couple it with XRD, to correlate these changes with accompanying changes in the long-range order of the material. These information will increase the understanding of properties required for highly active spinel catalysts in CO2 methanation and thus contributes to better catalysts.","2199":"This work investigates the application of highly-curved HAPG analyzer crystals in wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for the simultaneous analysis of lanthanides in unique extraterrestrial materials and explore its 3D voxel scanning capabilities at low excitation energies.

Standard MX using cryo-crystallography, as well as standard SAXS studies, are still an important aspect of our work, but now requires less beamtime than the larger BAG used in the past. Moreover, some of this work is connected to methodology developments or used as a stepping stone towards time-resolved crystallography studies.

","2202":"Metal\u2013ligand interaction is one of the major factors determining the chemical properties of inorganic and organometallic complexes. It is natural to expect that a series of metal complexes having the same metal center but different ligands would show different reactivities and reaction pathways. Such a dependency of the reactivities on the identity of the ligand allows room for the design and control of the reaction. For this purpose, it is necessary to understand the detailed molecular mechanism of how the M\u2013L interaction affects the reactivities and reaction pathways. In this proposal, we propose to visualize the structural change of [AuX2\u2212]n (X = Br or I) in acetonitrile during the photoreaction pathways.

CsV3Sb5 has become a highly topical material due to its unconventional superconducting phase. Given its complex electronic structure, it is thought that this state may host exotic quasiparticles like Majorana bound states. Interestingly, it has now been discovered that superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 is intimately related to competing charge density wave (CDW) instabilities, and, crucially, these electronic  uperstructures appear to be highly tuneable by hydrostatic pressure. However, so far, a detailed pressure-dependent crystallographic study and a characterization of the CDW order, its symmetry and mechanism has not been achieved.

Dynamic compression of the sample will be performed using our improved dynamic diamond anvil cell that allows now compression and decompression ramps spanning 3 orders of magnitude in time between 200 \u03bcs to 100 ms.

Further, we have developed new synchrotron X-ray imaging (sCT) technologies to allow determination of nanoscale mechanical strains in intact joints under loading using a unique mechanical loading rig (P2R). Here we will build on this work and examine our hypothesis that: growth plate cartilage dynamics and joint biomechanical functionality are intimately linked. We will apply loads to  young, adult and aged osteoarthritis-prone (STR\/Ort mice) and healthy (CBA wild-type mice) intact joints using the P2R and examine the subsequent strain patterns using our unique digital volume correlation code.

Xenon isotopes in mantle fluids indeed show that atmospheric Xe is recycled at depth via subduction, with a larger contribution to the mantle Xe budget than in the case of Ar, and potentially essentially carried in phyllosilicates due to their cage and layered structures along with water and other major volatile elements. However, there are very few data available to document this hypothesis in the case of Xe, and no crystallographic data at all. We therefore plan to elucidate Xe retention mechanism(s) in antigorite, the high pressure (P) form of serpentine and main carrier of water back into the mantle. For this, we need to collect high quality powder diffraction data  in situ within antigorite stability field, and beyond in temperature (T) to probe Xe behavior upon antigorite breakdown and water release.","2222":"The present study is focused on the determination of the local site of Yb 3+ ions in silica-based transparent glass ceramics and to its correlation with the observed luminescence properties.","2223":"Colloid dynamics will be investigated as a function of volume fraction around the glass transition.

Consequently, before attempting to understand the effect of additives on CaCO3 nucleation, we need to ensure a sufficient understanding of the system by itself. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the nucleation pathway of CaCO3 by a new experimental approach that allows probing the nanostructural evolution of very diluted systems. In addition, we will investigate the influence of additives on the nucleation of CaCO3.

We will combine GPCR photoswitchable ligand and time-resolved X-ray crystallography to decipher light-induced 7TM conformational changes and side-chain motions that define the structural basis of GPCR activity. Finally, GPCRs are validated drug target and their dysfunction is associated to numerous pathologies and neurologic disorders.

","2278":"Test measurements on ancient papyrus","2280":"This proposal focuses on the synergistic use of serial crystallography and powder diffraction for extracting domain size and strain estimates and phase weight estimates from microcrystalline protein powders. Serial diffraction images only record partial reflections and downstream processing requires a large number of independent observations per reflection to reliably converge and estimate the full reflection intensity. Parameters such as mosaic domain size and strain or co-existence of multiple crystalline phases further complicate processing. Here, we propose to use high resolution powder diffraction data for extracting domain size and strain distributions and feed those parameters back to serial data processing algorithms for more reliable merging and scaling from fewer diffraction images. Improvements in protein serial data processing could yield better electron density maps that would enable resolving finer structural details, which is crucial especially in time-resolved studies.","2282":"Homogenous alloy of 5 or more elements, commonly referred to as high entropy alloy nanocatalysts (HEAs), have recently demonstrated novel catalytic properties for a wide range of emerging electrocatalytic reactions. However, the absence of advance structural characterization efforts, especially those afforded by atomic-scale structural resolution, hinders our understanding about the true origin of HEAs\u2019 catalytic enhancement.  On the back of our group\u2019s recent breakthrough in resolving the atomic structure of HEAs, aided by PDF coupled with reverse Monte Carlo simulations, we are proposing a new set of experiments to study the dynamic structural changes in HEAs under electrochemical conditions. Using in-situ PDF analysis, we aim to uncover the spatiotemporal structural evolution of HEAs during methanol oxidation reaction, allowing us to build accurate structure-property relationships, which in turn will assist in the developing rational design strategies for HEAs.

The formation of MTPs during colloidal synthesis can occur through at least two different pathways: A) growth from multiply twinned seeds or B) the stepwise formation of new twin boundaries on single-crystalline seeds (either by particle overgrowth or multiparticle attachment). Despite the abundance of these MTPs in colloidal synthesis, little to none is known about the dynamic transformation from nucleation to crystal growth. This proposal aims to complete a systematic in situ X-ray Scattering of the formation mechanism of MTPs, to understand how the geometry of a crystal shape correlates with the local and global atomic arrangement in presence of twin structures.

WDM\r\nconditions are also produced in any laboratory experiment in which a solid is transformed to a plasma. A theoretical description of WDM is far\r\nfrom being achieved since conventional approximations that apply to solids or plasmas fail for such\r\ncomplex state and experimental data are scarce.

Moreover, these productions were not managed by the central power such as more prestigious productions; their study is also a good an appropriate way to investigate the local traditions and specifically to study how craftsmen were able to take advantage of their local resource.

We will carry out a multi-edge (Ce L3, Fe, Ni, Zn) HERFD-XAS study to understand the modification of the electronic structure as a function of the sample composition, sample morphology and under in situ conditions.

Preliminary experiments carried out at the D2AM beamline (proposal A021-900, main proposer G. Coativy, report 20201186) showed the determining role of the loading history on SIC since it enables to obtain, for a same crystallinity and stretching level, a very different mechanical response. This is likely related to the different stretching states of the amorphous chains which connect the crystallites, at the time these ones are nucleated and grow. Our objective is therefore to perform original in situ SAXS\/WAXS experiments using PI elastomers, crosslinked so that their chains between crosslinks have initially different lengths and stretching levels ; these materials will be submitted to different loading paths combining relaxation and fast stretching steps.

These samples are highly heterogeneous, necessitating spatially resolved \u00b5-XRF and \u00b5-XANES to clarify the identity of pigments and understand the presence of chlorine, which may be due to intentional use of copper chloride pigments or degradation\/alteration processes. Mock paintouts aged under high Cl conditions are studied to contextualise the presence of chlorine. This work improves our understanding of early modern pigment use, production, and degradation.

However, there is no consensus on the atomistic-level understanding of the orbital ordered state at this doping level. Recently, using a prototype based on CaMn3Mn4O12, we have revealed a new kind of orbital order at this critical doping level consisting of stripes of orbital ordered and charge disorder, providing the missing intermediate state between CE-type insulating, and FM metallic, phases. On the other hand, a completely distinct multiferroic ground state arising from charge-transfer and G-type orbital order, is found in HgMn3Mn4O12. It is surprising that substitution of Ca cations with isovalent Hg gives rise to such dramatic changes in physical properties. Here we propose a high resolution PXRD investigation of the rich orbital and charge ordered structures that span the solid solution Hg1-xNaxMn3Mn4O12.","2301":"Aim of this proposal is to study the structure of magnetosomes, which are chains of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles that we are able to extract and purify from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense bacteria.

Structural information regarding core and layer dimensions as well as core crystallinity and number of magnetosome units per chain will be obtained with SAXS and WAXS experiments that we plan to perform on samples obtained by bacteria that have been grown under a wide range of controlled conditions.","2302":"Two-dimensional (2D) materials are one- or few- atom thick crystals with high thermal and mechanical stability and physical properties governed by extreme quantum confinement. With its unique crystalline structure, graphene exhibits a plethora of unconventional electronic phenomena, whose exploration was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. Graphene is part of a larger family of 2D materials: one of its cousins, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), shares the same crystal lattice but exhibits different properties.  The state-of-the-art method for its synthesis is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on solid substrates, yet it is still difficult to control its thickness and structural quality over large scales.

(Mg,Fe)SiO3 liquids will be investigated by XAS coupled to laser-driven dynamic compression on the HPLF platform on ID24-ED beamline. In addition, XAS investigation of statically compressed glasses of similar composition at room temperature in DAC will be performed on BM23 beamline in order to have a good benchmark and support for the shock experiment thanks to a large EXAFS range, higher energy resolution and better signal to noise ratio.","2304":"various ex situ samples will be measured for inhouse experiments and for users","2305":"The aim of this proposal is to assess bone quality of osteosarcoma resected human tissue by using \u03bcXANES at the Ca K-edges to obtain the chemical speciation of mineral bone at a spatial resolution down to the micrometric scale.

Like the octopus, today\u2019s soft robots have a large number of degrees of freedom.  A contact-based interaction is similarly used in soft-robotics to reduce the complexity of controlling a large number of degrees of freedom but challenges for robotics include the mechanics and sensing required to build such systems.

Interestingly we observe, that the CO conversion is favoured in presence of water vapor in the gas feed (CO+O2+H2O, \u201cwet conditions\u201d). We believe that this significant enhance in catalytic performance, is due to the formations of extremely water derived active species (e.g hydroxyl and\/or carboxyl) on top of the Pt nanoparticles and to strong metal-support interaction (creation of Pt-Fe bonds). Using operando photon-in\/photon-out spectroscopy we will study the electronic structure and local coordination of Fe and Pt.","2311":"Industrial pigments have renewed the way to make art, allowing painters to have new, more stable, reliable, and purer materials. One important family of these pigments is the cadmium sulfur selenide, which is a solid solution whose color ranges from light yellow to dark red, depending on the Cd\/Se ratio. These materials were industrialized at the end of the XIX cent, and one of the first painters to employ them was Pellizza da Volpedo. A series of analyses have shown the use of these pigments in some of his tests and his famous painting \"Il quarto stato\". For this reason, a study on the pigments employed by the artist is now going on.

Superionic ammonia is characterized by a fast diffusion of the protons through the persistent nitrogen lattice. Since ammonia is an important component of the interior of icy planets and exoplanets, the precise knowledge of the P-T range of stability of superionic ammonia and of its physical properties is needed to determine whether the isentropes of these planets cross this phase. Recently, the existence of two different phases of superionic ammonia has been claimed. Nevertheless, there is to date no confirmation of this phase by independent experiments nor recent theoretical calculations, and no information on its structure\/EOS are available. We propose here to explore the structural evolution of superionic ammonia to identify accurately the different regimes\/structures.","2315":"Hydrocracking is one of the most important catalytic technologies in oil industry to convert heavy fractions of petroleum and renewable hydrocarbon  feedstocks into valuable diesel and jet-fuel products. Bifunctional catalysts containing an acid and a hydrogenation functionality are crucial for this technology. Designing new catalyst formulations to outperform with different feed compositions needs the understanding of the relationship between preparation, microstructure and performance under different conditions. In proposed experiment we will investigate hydrocracking catalyst extrudates at the nanoscale using nearfield ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (PCXT), that were deactivated in real industrial catalytic reactors where the oil feed compositions have different chemical nature. The correlation of coke deposition with the microstructure can give insights to the different deactivation mechanisms for catalysts used with different feedstocks.

In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, for small enough assemblies there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favourable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In the proposed experiment, we will apply the BCDI method to follow the evolution of lattice distortions in a branched protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also allow us to establish an explicit toolkit for controlled branching of macromolecular crystals.","2321":"Our purpose is to measure Ti, V, Cr and Fe valences in chromites in a set of olivine-rich primitive achondrite meteorites, namely brachinites and ungrouped achondrites with brachinite affinity, to obtain fO2 estimations. Spinel is a common accessory phase in terrestrial, lunar, martian and asteroidal ultramafic rocks. Moreover, being one of the first phases to crystallize from basaltic magmas and allowing the incorporation of many multivalent cations, it can provide insights on the pristine source composition and fO2 degree. Both brachinites and brachinite-like ungrouped achondrites represent oxidized meteorite groups and their genetic relationship remains still unknown. Although both groups share many similarities, textural and compositional features allow to infer about a different origin for their parent body(ies). A large and complete fO2 dataset could shed a new light on their genetic relationships and improve our knowledge about pristine parent body (ies) composition(s).","2323":"Expanding on our previous efforts and interest towards developing multidimensional magnetic systems, our current project aims to construct 3D magnetic networks through reactions between 2D magnetic networks and the pre-synthesized radical-based precursor: Na+(tpn)\u25cf-(THF) (tpn = terephthalonitrile). This radical ligand is expected to intercalate between these layered structures and bridge metal nodes of these 2D metal-organic frameworks in three dimensions with porosity, and to introduce additional magnetic coupling between layers and paramagnetic tpn\u25cf- linkers.In this project, it is expected that the beamline experiments at ID12, including XANES and XMCD for a series of compounds, will be used to assign the oxidation states and local magnetic moment of the Cr site and determine its chemical environment.

Recently, we made a ground-breaking discovery: 3D architected solids can exhibit remarkable damage tolerance violating the classical Griffith ideas of brittle fracture due to the inherent discreteness of the microstructure. Preliminary observations from in-situ fracture experiments in lab-based X-ray CT have shed initial light on this finding but the resolution and scan time preclude detailed study. It is now necessary to use a synchrotron facility to monitor the progress of fully embedded cracks in 3D as a function of loading and crack growth. The results, combined with numerical calculations, will lead to a revision of classical fracture mechanics to include architected metamaterials, enabling us to learn how to optimize the design lattice mechanical metamaterials for crack resistance.","2326":"Hard X-rays can trigger reversible atomic rearrangements in network glasses. There is a growing amount of literature investigating this effect and it has been observed to depend on the dose-rate and the local structure of the glass.

We propose to implement Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT) to determine the shape, arrangement, orientation and average elastic strain tensor of a representative ensemble of individual grains within a polycrystal for increasing tensile loading. Based on this unique experimental dataset, simulations and analytical methods can be combined to validate the MEM, yielding a new computationally extremely efficient approach for hierarchical materials informatics.","2328":"Structural studies on zeolite and gypsum hydrates","2329":"Ray-finned fishes (actinopterygians) today account for over half of all living vertebrates, and their origins date back over 300 million years.

However, this business can have a negative environmental impact since 1kg of chocolate has a global warming potential of 2.91-4.15kg CO2 eq., primary energy demand of 30-41 MJ and water footprint of 31-63L. The main contribution for this carbon footprint comes from the raw materials (milk powder, cocoa derivatives and sugar). For this reason, chocolate manufacturers are exploring novel solutions to replace or reduce the amount of these ingredients in chocolate. Cocoa butter and milk fat equivalents (CBE, MFE) are mixtures of triglycerides extracted from different plant-based sources that resemble these two fats in their physical properties. In this project we will use SAXS and WAXS to investigate the crystallization behaviour of commercial CBEs and MFEs, both on their own and mixed with cocoa butter.

For polymer hydrogenolysis chain length has been shown to impact reactivity and selectivity toward desired liquid products.

However, our RIXS measurements at the ADRESS\/SLS employing a magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) analysis suggests that the \u201cnear-flat band\u201d is quite dispersive and its intensity reduces upon approaching Tc. Applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T to fully polarize the spin will allow extracting the dynamic magnetism with circular polarized X-ray. However, due to limited energy resolution, we were unable to clearly resolve the spin waves from the asymmetric elastic peak. We therefore propose here to study Co3Sn2S2 by high-resolution MCD RIXS at ID32 to resolve the spin wave excitations, including the acoustic and optical mode, in which the latter is more likely to form the \u201ctrue\u201d flat band due to the kagome lattice structure.","2340":"Observation of crack patterns in IN718 samples submitted to accelerated stress corrosion cracking tests","2341":"We aim to establish a new class of minimal living membrane model systems to elucidate the role of lipidome complexity in membrane property and function.

Past XRD studies report a phase separation in oxygen deficient U-Ce-O and U-Pu-O systems (e.g. U0.5Ce0.5O1.95 compounds), in which the high temperature disordered fluorite phase gives way to two fluorite phases, stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric, at some point below 400\u00b0C. Neutron diffraction experiments suggest however that the low temperature sub-stoichiometric phase is probably not a fluorite. The exact nature of the phase transition mechanism, has not, as yet, been clearly identified and it is thought the key to this, lies in understanding in situ, the interplay between mobile anion vacancies and polaronic disorder involving Ce3+, Ce4+, U4+, U5+ ions.","2344":"The general background is the development of ferroelectric force sensors for the medical field.

The objective of the proposal is to study the formation of the ferroelectric phase with respect to the paraelectric phase in the P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer as a function of elongation. The motivation of the proposal is the knowledge of the ferroelectric properties of such sensors under elongation in order to get an accurate force measurement.

We suggest to screen sections of Planarians for iron deposits in specific regions of interest (ROIs) using SR-XRF. In these regions magnetic signature has been measured using MRI-QSM. Elemental mapping will allow us to test if the magnetic signature (QSM) correlates with the presence of iron, which would be indicative of magnetite-based magnetoreception. This data will provide the basis for ultrastructural investigations, immunohistological characterization and magnetic measurements of the particles to test whether they are suitable candidates for the long sought after magnetoreceptors.","2353":"This proposal aims to make the first ever direct measurements of how deeply-embedded defects impede the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition in lead free antiferroelectric materials.

While the majority of SACs have relatively low loadings (~ <2 wt% metal), high-density (HD) SACs are far less explored. This proposal aims to advance the field of HD-SACs by using two different polymerisation-based approaches for the synthesis of these catalysts. Employing 1,10-Phenanthrolin-5,6-dione as a ligand we are able to produce a library of HD-SACs with different metals. Alternatively, upon synthesis of a porphyrin polymer support and a subsequent metal coordination we are able to produce conductive HD-SACs.

These hydrogels have a huge swelling capacity, which makes them powerful encapsulation matrices. However, due to high AXf\r\nviscosity, strong gels were until now difficult to product. Since AXf bind efficiently to cellulose surfaces, we investigated AXf \/cellulose\r\nnanocrystals (CNC) gels.

Brasilodontids are the sister group to mammaliaforms (basal mammals) and inform on the evolution of traits that define mammals: endothermy (warm bloodedness), determinate growth (growth ceases after sexual maturity) and diphyodonty (only two sets of teeth). We will image growth structures in the teeth and jaws of brasilodontids to estimate their lifespan and growth patterns, as well as tooth replacement rates and patterns. These values will allow us to (1), estimate basal metabolic rate (BMR), post-natal growth rate and growth pattern in brasilodontids for the first time, critical to the debate on the evolution of endothermy; and (2) quantify dental replacement rates, crucial to understanding the acquisition of diphyodonty in mammaliaforms.

An intriguing thermal expansion behaviour is displayed by both YbPdIn and YbAl2 compounds, i.e., their volume thermal expansion shows an anomalous deflection at around room temperature (Figure 1). This phenomenon is due to a charge transfer process driven by Yb atoms [1]. However, the effects of charge transfer phenomena on the local vibrational dynamics, in particular on the transverse atomic vibrations related to negative thermal expansion (NTE), are still unknown. Accordingly, we aim to shed light on this unclear relationship between charge transfer and local dynamics by means of temperature-dependent XAFS spectroscopy.","2396":"High-entropy oxides are materials characterized by the intricate magnetic ground state arising from the presence of multiple transition metals and magnetic atoms.

The remaining  phases are incredibly complex, arguably among the most complicated structural  configurations observed in the elements - tI50, aP90, oC120 and mP512.  The complexity of the phase behavior above 100 gigapascals suggests extraordinary liquid and solid states of sodium at extreme conditions and has implications for other seemingly simple metals.\r\nIn the past decade there were several technological advances which reshaped the modern high-pressure experimental single crystal spectroscopy.

In the latter context the potential for serpentinization to generate natural H2 and abiotic CH4 is not well understood. Since the release of reduced fluids is guided by the oxidation of ferrous iron into ferric iron hosted in secondary minerals (mainly serpentine and magnetite), the definition of the Fe3+\/FeTot ratio in high-pressure serpentinites is fundamental to provide new insights on the magnitude of redox transformation and the related deep H2-CH4 formation in subduction zones.

This OM would have interacted with large amounts of water only during the accretion and differentiation of these bodies (before\/during the formation of the refractory core). Inside larger water-rich exoplanets, these interactions could have happened at conditions above the critical point of water, leading to the efficient dissolution of the OM and to the formation of specific alteration minerals and volatiles (as was shown in our previous experiments). However, during the formation of the smaller icy moons of the solar system, water is not expected to have reached a supercritical state. The evolution of the OM in these conditions remains largely unknown.

Ketov et al. [2] examined the presence of such an effect in the context of structural and elastic heterogeneities in MGs. Hufnagel [3] suggested that the effect should be caused in the atomistic configurations. We expect to clarify that structural changes universally occur in MGs by the rejuvenation effect, although depending on the extent of structural\/elastic heterogeneities.","2436":"The proposed experiment will investigate the electronic structure of Uranium (U) in a wide range of environmentally relevant species as solid and adsorbed species using U M4, M5 edge high energy-resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). U(VI), (V) and (IV) samples will be synthesised with a range of environmentally relevant ligands e.g. oxide, silicate and phosphate. The HERFD-XANES and RIXS spectra will be collected and analysed to determine how these techniques and approaches can be applied to determine U speciation in complex environmental systems. The results from HERFD-XANES and RIXS measurements will be supported by ligand field theory calculations to deepen our understanding of variations in the electronic structure of U in environmentally relevant samples.

A current limitation of SX for high-throughput applications are the long data collection times and the large amounts of sample required for such projects. Within this proposal we aim at developing the new method of beam sweeping SX, where the X-ray is scanned over the semi-stationary sample with the use of rotating X-ray mirrors. The proposed beam-sweeping SX approach will allow MHz data collection with a complete dataset to be collected in seconds, enabling rapid structure determination.

Although some Ru complexes have already reached clinical trials, e.g., KP1019 (indH2[trans-RuCl4(indH)2]; ind = indazole), developed by one of the co-authors of this proposal (Arion), investigations of analogous Os complexes are still in development but have shown great promise as (pro)-drugs. In this context, we carried out 187Os nuclear resonance scattering in a series of nine Os coordination complexes to obtain detailed information on the local coordination (the so-called quadrupole splitting) and the vibrational properties (summarized in the density of vibrational states of Os). An important issue, which still needs to be addressed, is to obtain information on the Os oxidation state (obtained from the so-called isomer shift).","2440":"The aim of this proposal is to solve the structure of the high-pressure solid phases of ammonia hydrates through single-crystal synchrotron XRD in the 10-20 GPa, 300-700 K range. Ammonia hydrates are fascinating systems for fundamental sciences as archetype compounds forming hydrogen (H) bonds but also for planetary sciences as major components of the icy planets. Constraining the interior structure of celestial bodies requires information on H2O\/NH3 mixtures of various compositions and over a large range of pressure (P) and temperature (T). We have investigated the high P [50 GPa]-high T [800K] phase diagrams of the three ammonia hydrates and discovered a general behavior, in particular the occurrence in three hydrates of \u201cquasi-bcc\u201d phases. The structure, O\/N and H ordering of these phases are still unknown and will be studied in this proposal by single-crystal XRD experiments.

The samples are characterized for the composition and XRD was used to probe the film thickness. Muon spectroscopy was performed at PSI, Switzerland, while previous XMCD were measured at KIT Light Source, Germany. The incorporation of Ca is observed to enhance the magnetic response of Ni and Fe, with a concomitant reduction in the Co signal.

In Li-ion the liquid electrolytes are flammable by nature and moving to a safe solid-state one is of interest. In addition, solid electrolytes are foreseen as a solution to avoid the main drawback of such batteries, i.e. polysulfide shuttle. During cycling, the soluble products, Li polysulfide (Li2Sx, 2<x<8), produced at the cathode diffuse in the electrolyte until the anode, in a back-and-forth manner leading to strong capacity fading. This dynamic process is highly dependent on the electrolyte nature and new chemistry is needed to develop a reliable device. We propose XANES and XES investigation on solid-state organic\/inorganic electrolyte. To mimic battery failure, the electrolytes are pre-contaminated with Li2Sx of different chain lengths and concentration. The goal is to determine the interlink between the electrolyte nature and the polysulfides to move toward an optimized material.","2476":"The project wishes to develop catalysts based on Transition Metal Carbides (TMC) (mainly Mo or W) which are attractive alternatives to noble metals due to the coexistence of metallic and acidic\/oxophilic functionalities from abundant and cost-effective available metals. One of the main difficulties with carbide catalysts is to control their activation (carburization) in order to precisely control the carbide\/oxide balance needed for selective hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. We propose the thorough characterization of the Tungsten catalysts supported on TiO2 and carbon using High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence detected XAS (HERFDXAS) at the W L3 edge during the carburization process for probing the full carbide speciation in severe conditions (high temperature, 700-800\u00b0C, and in Methane\/hydrogen atmosphere).

Recently it has been reported that this system also exhibits ferroelectricity below 98K, concomitant to a structural distortion from Fd\\bar{3}m to the P4122 space group. While our attempt to confirm this structural distortion at low temperature failed so far, our recent X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements under pressure and at room temperature surprisingly revealed the presence of a wide transition occurring between 30 and 55 GPa, which nature remain puzzling. This proposal aims at characterizing, in detail, the crystallographic structure of the spinel NiFe2O4 at low and room temperature, ambient pressure and above 55 GPa to have a complete overview of the (Pressure - Temperature) structural phase diagram of this system.","2478":"The kinetics of Hydrogen and Deuterium Evolution Reactions (HER\/DER) are pivotal in advancing hydrogen-based energy conversion technologies like electrolyzers and fuel cells. This project aims to investigate both the thermodynamics and kinetics governing the ad-, ab-, and desorption processes of hydrogen and deuterium onto palladium nano-crystallites (NCs). Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), we intend to dynamically visualize, in situ, the three-dimensional evolution of the deformation and strain fields within Pd nano-crystallites in an electrochemical cell during H2O and D2O electrolysis.

Soot particles, which have known links to health issues and climate change, will be studied using a double-stage burner and advanced optical techniques. The addition of Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) at ESRF will allow for detailed analysis at smaller scales. The study aims to isolate and better understand the oxidation process, contributing to improved combustion and emission reduction in the aeronautic industry. The requested beamtime at the ID02 beamline is justified for its unique capabilities in examining particle sizes and morphology.

A solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed from reactions of the electrolyte with Li. The SEI is essential in regulating transport of reactants to the electrode to mitigate the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Previous synchrotron experiments yielded valuable insights into the SEI. However, due to the cell used low amounts of NH3 were produced, hindering the detection of intermediate species. We propose further experiments, under more scalable conditions using a cell that allows for higher NH3 production by flowing the electrolyte. The inclusion of new diglyme based electrolytes and a PtAu catalyst on a gas diffusion counter electrode with H2 limits electrolyte decomposition. Further advancements in the LiMeAS field such as pulsed deposition and different proton shuttles will also be included.","2482":"We propose to image antiferromagnetic domains in pyrochlore iridates (RE2Ir2O7, RE = Rare Earth) by scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy, using resonant X-ray scattering as magnetic contrast. At low temperature, both the Ir4+ and RE3+ sublattices host so-called \u201cAll-In-All-Out\u201d magnetic orders with antiphase domains. These antiphase domains have been evidenced by various techniques, but their coincidence on both sublattices remains to be studied. Only X-rays, using absorption edges of both sublattices, are able to provide distinct pictures of the domain structures in both sublattices. This missing information is crucial to understand how such domains can be manipulated. Indeed, it has been suggested that magnetic monopoles in the RE sublattice could be used to manipulate the domains of the Ir4+ sublattice. If this first experiment is successful, it could lead to further studies under magnetic field, possibly with the full-field diffraction microscope of the beamline.","2483":"We will exploit the unique capability of ID02 to measure \u00b5m- to nm- scale X-ray reflections with millisecond time resolution to determine both the molecular and supra-molecular mechanisms that control the dynamics of relaxation of intact skeletal muscles following single action potential stimulation in near-physiological conditions that mimic the performance of the muscle-tendon complex in vivo. On the molecular scale, we will measure structural changes in both the thick (myosin-containing) and thin (actin-containing) filaments. On the supra-molecular scale, we will characterize the inter-sarcomere dynamics that limit the rate of relaxation in vivo, and relate those changes in sarcomere length to simultaneous conformational changes in the thick and thin filaments. The results will underpin the development of new therapeutics for muscle weakness.","2484":"Despite progress in alternative battery technologies, such as using solid electrolytes, Lithium-ion Batteries (LiB) with Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and Lithium iron Phosphate (LFP) cathodes make up to 60% and 30% of worldwide battery production respectively. There are significant disagreements between manufacturers regarding the two technologies, with cobalt mining being linked to human exploitation, and LFP having lower energy density. Questions remain on how battery geometry, cathode metal crossover, and temperature affect the battery performance. By leveraging the speed and precision of new pixelated photon counting detectors (PCD), we have developed Full-Field Hyperspectral Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence Tomography, providing 3D fluorescence data without the need for raster scanning. We are currently at a stage where we can capitalize on its potential with operando and in-situ studies, and we will introduce coded apertures to study the performance of NMC811 and LFP LiBs in 3D.","2485":"Au-Pt alloys are widely used as spinnerets for producing textile fibres due to their excellent corrosion resistance. Component lifetime is limited by their susceptibility to mechanical damage due to their low strength. A widely used alloy, Au30Pt1Rh at.%, can be aged to a hardness of 255 HV. While higher Pt containing alloys can achieve higher hardness values, the narrow gap between solvus and solidus temperatures (heat treatment window) introduces a risk of incipient melting during homogenisation. We have developed an AuPtPd alloy with high hardness (338 HV) and a wide heat treatment window. STEM images reveal that the alloy has a modulated microstructure after cooling, while XRD patterns show evidence of an additional low symmetry phase. To optimise alloy composition and processing, the crystal structures of all phases, and their precipitation sequences, must be understood. It is thus proposed that synchrotron X-ray diffraction be used in situ to track the microstructural evolution.","2488":"In the context of the project \u2018HyperStock\u2019, within the PEPR strategy \u201cHydrog\u00e8ne D\u00e9carbon\u00e9\u201d, we study the damaging of materials (polyamide 11, PA11) used as liners in hyperbar hydrogen tanks. We investigate a specific type of damage\/evolution mechanism: nano-cavitation caused by explosive decompression under hydrogen gas. To potentially detect a nano-cavitation process, combined USAXS and in-situ tension are required. The studied samples are lab-scale PA11 samples preliminary submitted to compression-decompression cycles in H2 environment (in collaboration with P\u2019 Institut at ENSMA Poitiers).

MPT is a diffusionless, often reversible phase transformation between a high-symmetry and a low-symmetry phase. It is the enabling mechanism behind the novel properties of SMAs and TRIP steels, but functional fatigue continues to be a major barrier. Functional fatigue is caused by stress fields that form at the phase interface and lead to dislocation generation. We plan to use dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) to measure these interfacial stress fields during stress-induced MPT, using a mechanical load frame. A strong factor in the fatigue properties is the kinematic compatibility.  NiTiPd SMAs have tunable kinematic compatibility and several compositions will be mechanically cycled to observe how dislocations develop and influence the functional fatigue behavior.","2492":"\ufffcHeterogeneous Fenton-like reactions using airborne O2 as sole oxidant are gaining a fast-growing interest to eliminate organic contaminant in soils and groundwaters.

We will also determine the evolution of the local structure around iron after redox cycling steps, using Fe K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy. Redox and structural information gained on the reactive Fe mineral substrates will be directly compared with the amount of radical species measured by EPR-spin trapping (see Figure) and to degradation rates of priority pollutants (HAP, pesticides) measured by ECOSYS\/INRAE in similar redox cycling experiments.

We fundamentally study the effect of electric field on the membrane performance via relating membrane properties, such as OH- conductivity, to the morphological changes in the membrane upon application of the electric field. To evaluate the microstructural changes in the membrane, we aim to use small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), which can reveal essential information about (1) formation of microstructures within the amorphous polymer backbone, (2) conformational changes within polymer structure, and (3) possible micro-phase separation.","2499":"The project aims at studying the potential therapeutic effects of Dasatinib, Quercetin and RO0711401 in an experimental model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) by using a high-sensitivity microscopic approach based on X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT (X-PCI-CT) for multiscale, post-mortem 3D virtual-histology. Neuroprotection is demanded in neurodegenerative disorders such as SCA1, but to date no treatment is currently available. SCA1 is a dominantly inherited genetic disease due to an increase in the number of CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene leading to an expanded polyQ tract in the ataxin-1 protein, and degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC). The expanded ataxin-1 protein forms toxic aggregates, likely the major cause of neuronal cell death. Senescence and reduction of mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in neurodegeneration. Targeting senescent cells or mGlu1 receptors could be potential disease modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.","2502":"In this second part of the sample preparation, the e-beam evaporator for Ni metal will be calibrated with a quartz microbalance.

To date, studies that address the in situ crystallization of glasses are scarce, and the characterization of the structure formed in situ and its transformations during decompression are being studied. This work aims to address this gap by employing the Multi Anvil system in conjunction with in situ analysis of the formed structure and sample recovery to investigate the phases retained at atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, we will seek to further analyze the mechanical properties.

","2508":"All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with Li-metal anodes are a promising solution to enable safe, high-capacity Li-ion batteries. Challenges for ASSBs include loss of contact between the cathode \/ solid-state electrolyte (SSE) due to volume change of the cathode during lithiation leading to inactive cathode particles and capacity fade. We have developed two new SSEs based on the popular Li6PS5Cl SSE which aim to provide improved strain relief throughout cycling, thereby maintaining contact with the cathode and improving cycle life. By using X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) correlated with absorption contrast x-ray computed tomography (XCT), we propose to study how stress from volume change of the cathode during cycling is relieved via (a) strain fields within the SSE and (b) delamination between cathode particles and the surrounding SSE.

The recent discovery of SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content discovered so far, offers to put in practice that prediction. The insulator to metal transition by bandgap closure in Sr-doped molecular hydrogen compound is expected to occur around 220 GPa.\r\nThis proposal aims at reproducing the synthesis of the SrH22 compound, to obtain it in pure form to be able to refine its structure, and to determine its pressure stability range and the structural changes upon entering the metal state.

Damage and failure in\r\nductile metals is governed by the growth of internal voids under tension, ultimately leading to the\r\ncoalescence of individual voids to form a macroscopic crack. Resolving this complex mechanism in-situ,\r\ni.e., during a dynamic loading event, is a challenge since observing how microvoids grow and coalesce\r\nis inherently elusive, as it transpires beneath the surface of non-transparent materials. Nevertheless,\r\nunderstanding of this process holds paramount significance to accurately model metal behaviour\r\nunder extreme loading conditions.

One of the goals of these proposals is to solve a long-standing fundamental controversy, that goes back to the early days, on the means by which the CDW state is created: either weak or strong electron-phonon coupling. A key point in this controversy is how the CDW is pinned to the lattice, and therefore experiments under an applied electric field are mandatory. IXS experiments are in principle feasible but are time consuming and, in view of our past experience, it is very unlikely that they can be of much help in this task [HC-4045].

Employing operando XAS, we propose to study how Zn atom density on the support influences the Zn coordination environments and electronic properties at different reaction temperatures and pressures, and to verify the synergistic activation pathways of CO2 over neighbouring Zn single atoms, as anticipated from our previous kinetic studies.

The challenges associated to hydrated cells include not only reduced resolution and contrast, but also increased radiation damage and the need for more complex sample environments. In the proposed experiment, we suggest to examine hydrated cells in a dedicated sample chamber at the nanobranch of ID13, in order to collect data on local structural information in a highly spatially resolved manner.","2913":"scanning microdiffraction on soft matters","2915":"Crystallisation in porous media is an important process in many natural systems, including biomineralisation, frost heave and salt weathering.

Studies of the last decades evidence that polar molecules may nonetheless be enclathrated, producing stable solid phases in the presence of clathrate promoters, with the formation of guest-host hydrogen bonds. So far, this phenomenon has been studied only for the common sI, sII, and sH binary clathrates while host-guest hydrogen bonding in HP dense clathrates have not been addressed. Recently, we have synthesised at HP-LT conditions several dense acetone clathrates featuring hydrogen bonging between oxygen of the acetone molecule and a framework oxygen.

In this regard, both developing practical strategies to introduce controlled strain fields in nanomaterials to reversibly vary their crystalline structure (i.e., in-plane propagation direction of the polaritons in \u03b1-MoO3) and a precise quantification of the strain field in terms of magnitude and anisotropy are fundamental.

Both studies have been performed on recovered samples and give no clues on the timing and mechanisms of this transformation (e.g. peak shock or adiabatic release).

The aim of this proposal is to address this issue by assessing nickel speciation at a model site representative of the most fire-sensitive drinking water catchment sites of this French overseas Territory. Ni K-edge XAS information will be coupled with data on nickel leachability to understand how wildfires can impact drinking water quality through nickel dispersion from ultramafic soils\/sediments.

","2936":"Superconducting cuprates universally have a propensity towards charge ordering. Superconductivity and charge order (CO) show an intricate competition that can be tuned by external parameters such as magnetic field, hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure. Experiments under uniaxial compression have revealed that a dramatic nonlinear suppression of the superconducting Tc favors a long-ranged 3D CO. For now, large pressures have been applied to YBa2Cu3O6.67 (Tc=65 K), a doping at which CO is strongest in the absence of pressure. However, the doping dependence at high pressure remains to be investigated. During our recent x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment on YBCO6.67 under uniaxial compression, we have followed the evolution of 2D CO and the emergence of the 3D CO state while simultaneously monitoring the modifications of the lattice.

Regardless of the achieved high degree of control over the crystal phase of GaAs NWs during latter growth stages, it is challenging to control the polytypism at the beginning of the NW growth due to transients in the droplet contact angle. Here, we aim to correlate the crystal structure of as-grown GaAs NWs with the wetting angle of their catalyst liquid Ga droplets at the nucleation phase, by performing (1) grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering on the Ga droplets, and (2) asymmetric X-ray diffraction of polytype sensitive reflections on the NWs underneath.","2939":"XPCS measurements on colloidal suspensions submitted to hydrostatic pressure.

Knowledge of this distance dependency is critical for an accurate diagnosis.","2946":"The fascinating properties of high Tc superconducting cuprates are often attributed to the peculiar entwining of sev-eral degrees of freedom (charge density and anisotropy, spin, lattice modes). This implies that the corresponding excitations all have comparable energies, lying in the mid (<500 meV) and far infrared range (<100 meV), and are often of mixed character. Aside to the low energy region, RIXS spectra are dominated by the dd excitations, which are often dismissed as uninteresting. However, two recent experiments are now hinting to band-like effects occurring in the dd excitations of cuprates. We propose to measure the azimuthal (\u03c6) dependence of the dd excitations in the striped cuprate LSCO, at different doping levels, to confirm the existence of unexpected jumps in the dd intensi-ty. The doping, temperature and q dependence of these discontinuities will confirm if this effect is band-like, possi-bly telling us which low energy order is involved in this phenomenology.","2948":"The aim of this project is to investigate the evolution of the crystallographic phase and detailed coordination environment of non-stochiometric inorganic halide perovskite powders upon heating under high vacuum (<10-6 mbar), mimicking the conditions during deposition by thermal evaporation.

With the new EBS of ESRF and the setup available at ID15a, it can be now possible to study these materials with total scattering in situ as a function of the pressure. In this experiment, we will explore the local arrangement of two fluorite-type minerals (CaF2 and BaF2) tracing a link between disordered local structure and the average behavior upon compression.","2970":"Cobalt-based COx hydrogenation catalysts have become increasingly interesting to the scientific community as reports throughout the last decade have shown it acts as a versatile catalyst for the synthesis of a multitude of chemicals, ranging from hydrocarbons and olefins in Fischer-Tropsch, to aromatics and oxygenates.

The mechanisms through which these reaction inhibitions and cocrystal decompositions occur remain entirely unknown, despite our recent efforts to understand them using ex situ crystallographic analyses. We therefore trust that only in situ and time-resolved X-ray powder diffraction studies of the mechanochemical cocrystallisation reactions can elucidate the unknown decomposition pathways, which may involve the formation and breakdown of intermediate crystal forms.","2974":"By investigating the L3 edge of Pd the objectives of this study are: (1) to uncover the interaction of CH4 and H2O with Pd species under reaction conditions, and (2) reveal the structural particularities of Pd sites leading to the fast inhibition and long-term H2O-deactivation behaviour for Pd\/Al2O3 methane oxidation catalyst.

In doing so, improving our understanding of the multiscale structure\/transport interplay within solid-state organic electrolytes will become instrumental to address the associated scientific and technological challenges. Directing the hierarchical self-assembly of nanoscale ionic pathways appears as a promising strategy to allow the advent of such higher performance electrolytes1. Mastering defects in functional organic materials, which plays crucial roles in many nano-science\/technology applications, is here applied within the context of directional confined ionic transport2 (nanoionics3) in functional soft matter.

Given the CO2 concentration in the air is at its highest in human history, it poses a tremendous threat to the longevity of infrastructure. This study is the world\u2019s first time-resolved carbonation XRD-CT evaluation of novel low carbon cements, and provides new fundamental knowledge about factors controlling changes in mineralogy, reaction products, and microstructure upon CO2 exposure. Specifically this study will identify changes in porosity and microcracks formation occurring in specimens upon CO2 exposure; elucidate carbonation extent of low carbon cements, tracing changes in pore structure and formation of crystalline reaction products (e.g. carbonate polymorphs) when exposed to CO2; and will aid validating\/ refuting existing carbonation mechanisms proposed for low carbon cements. These unique outcomes will enable optimisation of cement formulations for increasing carbonation resistance.","3000":"Conditions on the early Earth were hostile with intense UV radiation, but cells still managed to adapt and thrive. The evolution of new metabolic pathways is the obvious route by which cells coped with environmental pressures, however, the social lives of cells were just as important (West et al. 2007). Cooperation and sociality are the well-known mechanisms for dealing with environmental stress and the evolution of complexity (Durand et al. 2016), but how this played out in the earliest prokaryote groups is unknown. A palaeontological angle to this issue is almost entirely unexplored and represents a huge gap in knowledge. We wish to address this gap, by examining the earliest fossilized evidence of sociality in robust lensoidal to spheroidal microbes.

Here, we will explore the LLT by suppressing crystallization with the use of cryoprotected aqueous solutions. We aim to go beyond LLT structural kinetics studied previously and explore the dynamic properties with X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). Varying the concentration and composition of the solutions allows us to explore different parts of the state diagram. Our experiment will provide a new insight into the critical fluctuations and unlock new pathways for accessing LLT dynamics hidden by crystallization for a broad range of liquids, including biological solutions.

Intra-crystalline organic molecules are known to induce lattice distortions in biogenic and synthetic CaCO3. However, our previous HR-XRD measurements (HC_4779) showed that naphthazarin, part of the PHNQ family do not induce such lattice distortion when occluded into calcite via ACC precipitation and crystallization in water (dissolution\/reprecipitation mechanisms). To complete our understanding of the mechanism of naphthazarin occlusion we here measure calcite-naphthazarin samples obtained after ACC crystallization induced by heating (solid-state transformation).","3013":"Due to its bandgap tunability over the infrared spectrum, HgCdTe\/CdZnTe is used to cover most IR detection applications, but performance depends on the density of\r\ndislocations so that lattice matching of epitaxial HgCdTe is targeted.

On the other hand, there are increasing demands to reduce the on-board weight in order to reach more effective launching by lowering the fuel consumption. Porous ceramics present a good candidate for light protective solutions thanks to the ability to dissipate impact energy through fragmentation and to tailor their microstructural porosity within a given need. Therefore, the mechanical behavior of porous ceramics under dynamic loadings needs to be assessed in order to gain better understanding of the local damage and fracture\r\nmechanisms under high strain rate loadings. The aim of this proposal is thus to identify the fracture mechanisms in porous ceramics and how they are modified by the microstructure type (size and morphology of porosities) and the strain-rate.","3024":"The Institut Pasteur\u2019s BAG gathers the projects of the research units and platforms of the Institut Pasteur in Paris which are active in the field of structural biology: Structural Microbiology (P.M.

X-ray fluorescence microscopy will enable to map and quantify Mn distribution in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes. Primary rat hippocampal neurons will be cultured alone, or with astrocytes and exposed to non-toxic or toxic Mn concentrations. We expect a reduced Mn content in neurons cultured with astrocytes.

The study will be performed on an IPN microgel at high PAAc content that, in a recent rheological study [1], has revealed liquid-glass and glass-jammed transitions at increasing concentration. Moreover, the system is characterized by a volume phase transition (VPT) from a swollen to a shrunken state around T=305 K, therefore it would be interesting to probe the dynamics and structure as a function of temperature across the VPT for a microgel with high PAAc content, at high concentration.

On the other hand, we discovered that it induces a phase separation between complex noncollinear magnetic regimes on a lengthscale of 90nm ~ 15um. One likely mechanism would be underlying structural inhomogeneities. Magnetoelastic coupling should allow us to distinguish the lattices of the two magnetic regimes. A multi-phase refinement could then reveal variations of the atomic positions and\/or occupancies.

Two possible mechanisms are proposed, i.e., solid-solid vs dissolution-reprecipitation. We demonstrated with an in vitro model, that a solid-solid transition produces crystalline properties similar to the ones observed in our biogenic model. We now hypothesize that a solid-solid transition is at play in most of calcareous biomineralization. With this proposal, we want to assess the generality of this result, by producing 3D crystalline property maps of a series of biominerals, chosen among different phyla. This proposal exploits the unique features of 3D Bragg ptychography to produce detailed maps of crystalline coherence domains, combined with the drastically improved brilliance of the ESRF-EBS, allowing us to investigate a significant number of large sample volumes.

Modulating its cellular concentration has emerged in the focus of modern optogenetic applications putting forward the photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) in the optogenetics toolbox. PACs are light-activated enzymes that combine the capacity of a photoreceptor with that of an adenylyl cyclase; the latter being an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP (adenosine 5' triphosphate) to cAMP. We propose to use high-pressure macromolecular crystallography to study the energy landscape, conformational fluctuations and breathing motions between sub-states of the photoactivated adenylate cyclase (PAC) from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) in order to explore the allosteric transitions between its conformational states.","3139":"We want to use high-resolution crystallography to continue or do new fundamental research on: 1) the oxygen-sensitivity of metalloenzymes and metalloproteins; 2) maturation proteins involved in the biosynthesis of metal sites in hydrogenases and nitrogenase; 3) SAM radical enzymes; 4) the biological assembly of iron-sulfur clusters; 5) the role of quinolinate synthase in NAD biosynthesis; 6) transduction of signals like oxygen and NO by Fe-S cluster-dependent transcriptional regulators.

In our search for such a transition, we wish to study the field dependence of a temperature-induced phase transition exhibited by CrCl2(pyrazine)2 and probe whether it is possible to induce the transition by field alone. The material can be directly synthesised either in the orthorhombic Immm phase or the tetragonal I4\/mmm phase. As the tetragonal phase exhibits a conductivity three times higher than that of the orthorhombic phase, manipulating the transition between the two phases via field will allow a fine-tuning of the material\u2019s conductive properties that has previously been unachievable.

We will construct thin-layer capacitors, assembled onto lithographic electrode arrays. The cubic phase of BTO above TC = 373K is paraelectric and would not respond to the applied electric field. Below TC, BTO becomes tetragonal and ferroelectric, so can be polarized and store energy. However, when synthesized under hydrothermal conditions, BTO nanoparticles are found to be cubic at room temperature. These particles are found to have a several-fold enhanced dielectric constant, exceeding 6000. Our model is that nano-BTO is cubic on average because of strain, while its 50nm-sized domains are locally tetragonal. We expect to see changes of the domain structure when the capacitor voltage is changed. This will be visible directly in the diffraction patterns, and later revealed by BCDI phase retrieval.","3153":"The tempera grassa painting technique, based on emulsions of egg yolk and oil, is a key marker of the evolution of artistic practice during the Renaissance. Yet despite its significance in art history, it remains barely studied from a physico-chemical point of view. Distinctive properties may arise from the organization of the different phases (egg yolk, oil, pigment particles) at a colloidal scale. Therefore, a method allowing three-dimensional mapping and chemical identification of these systems at the nanometric scale is essential. We propose to carry out phase contrast X-ray nano-holotomography on laboratory-prepared paint samples for this purpose.

We aim to track how domain movements and kinetics in a bacterial calcium-transporting P-type ATPase (LMCA1) are regulated by lipid chemistry and pH levels. Lipids modulate membrane protein function, but the connection between lipid chemistry and reaction cycle kinetics and dynamics is not well understood. Survival of pathogenic bacteria under basic conditions depends critically on Ca2+ transport. Therefore, structural and kinetic mapping of pH-dependent LMCA1 dynamics can potentially provide clues to better understand the structural basis of infection processes.

To enable smaller stacks that are more cost competitive with less IrOx use, operation at higher current densities (higher H2 production rates) is desirable. However, at these high current densities (>10 A\/cm2) proton exchange membrane (PEM) can suffer from local dehydration, especially at the stack outlets.

Herein, we aim to investigate the electronic configuration of the CoII-OPh intermediates (OPh is phenolate) at different oxidation states, which have been identified by electrochemical techniques as the real active species under catalytic conditions. The fully understanding of the highly reactive intermediate will shed light one the factors that governs the catalytic performance with qpy-based systems, helping for the future design of CO2 reduction catalysts.\r\n\r\n","3228":"The main purpose of this proposal, by means of the ID-15 beam line features, is to evaluate the performance in spectroscopy, 3D spatial resolution and polarimetry of new CZT spectrometer sensors developed in the framework of the project: 3DCaTM fo funded by the Italian Space Agency. This 3D CZT sensor technology is based on the so-called CZT Drift Strip detector [1] with a digital signal readout and processing. These 3D CZT sensors can acts as building element for instrumentation in next generation of high-energy telescopes, such as focal planes of new high energy focussing optics (e.g. broadband Laue lenses). A fine spectroscopy combined with sub-mm position resolution in 3D and a powerful digital readout will allow the precise reconstruction of the photon interaction, a feature that is essential to achieve, at the time, high efficiency and response uniformity, good background rejection capabilities, and high sensitivity in scattering polarimetry.

The system is a non-collinear antiferromagnet with TN~32K. But despite sizeable spin-orbit coupling due to the magnetic exchange via Se, the observed anomalous Hall conductivity should be symmetry forbidden in the published R3m crystal structure (no inversion symmetry). However, the physical properties, in particular the transport, are strongly dependent on the exact composition of the compound. We suggest an investigation of the crystal structure of samples with well characterised composition (stoichiometric vs. Ag-poor) down to temperatures below TN and above T~450K (transition to R-3m with restored inversion symmetry). A composition dependent additional symmetry breaking in analogy to the Ag(Cu)CrS2 sister compounds could explain the observed spectacular physical properties.","3232":"Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed by polyhedral water cages of different size filled with gas molecules in a non-stochiometric ratio. Under high pressure conditions most of gas hydrates transform gas-filled ices, constituted by a water-ice skeleton isostructural to one of the low pressure ice phases filled with gas molecules in its channels. The gas molecules prevent the empty ice structure to collapse exerting a strong hydrophobic repulsion on the water molecules, and are in such a way confined at remarkable high densities in the ice skeleton. In a recent HP powder diffraction experiment on the ID 15 beamline we have observed the formation of the DFT predicted C3 phase of the hydrogen-hydrate. This filled ice is based on ice Ic frame and has an exceptionally high H2O: 2H2 ratio. Here we propose a new experiment on the Id28 beamtime to fully determine C3 structure, including H2 positions, by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This study is part of a PhD thesis project.","3234":"The aim of this study is to build a link between spatial and temporal aspects of adaptation of microalgae to metal pollution. We want to draw a route of movement of Mn and Ni ions between extracellular barriers and organelles in Chlorella cells in the course of response to Mn and Ni excess. XRF is essential for intracellular metal mapping because it enables the localization of Mn and Ni through the identification of cellular compartments according to the known distribution of elements (P, Ca, Fe, Cl, S, Zn). The understanding of mechanisms of adaptation will help the development of microalgae-based biotechnologies for wastewater treatment and metal recovery.","3236":"SiOx is one of the most promising materials to increase the capacity of anodes for next-generation Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs), with theoretical storage\r\n capacities of up to 2400 mAhg-1. However, the stability and storage capacity of SiOx anodes depends on its oxygen content, and therefore the development\r\n of synthesis routes for the controlled synthesis of SiOx compounds with tailored oxygen content is imperative. MagnesioThermic reduction (MgTR) has been\r\n pinpointed as a scalable method to produce SiOx from Mg and SiO2 using much lower temperatures (500-950\u00baC) than conventional methods. However, synthesis\r\n temperature, reaction time and stoichiometry of the reactants strongly affect reaction pathways and prevents the controlled synthesis of SiOx compounds with\r\n adjusted oxygen content. Hence, in situ analysis of the MgTR via X-ray diffraction is critical to design an effective strategy for the synthesis of high-performance\r\n SiOx electrodes for LIBs.","3237":"We will apply ex situ Bragg coherent diffraction imaging to measure the morphology and lattice displacement fields of pristine and indented Platinum particles. The indentation will be performed prior the experiment at IM2NP (Marseilles).","3239":"The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical (steel, concrete, ceramics or energy materials) and biological materials (bone, teeth, wood, tendon). To determine the crystallographic texture of such materials in 3D we are developing Texture tomography (TexTom) based on the previously established technique of X-ray small-angle scattering tensor tomography (SASTT) and its transfer to diffraction. TexTom differs from SASTT as it uses a projection model, which uses all available reflections in the diffraction pattern and not just a single q-range, as SASTT does. We propose to deploy this technique at ID15A and study the attainable real and reciprocal space resolution on a custom-designed texture test pattern. In this way, we will obtain ground truth data before the technique finds wider application on biomaterials such as the bone-tendon enthesis or technical materials such as fibre reinforced polymers. ","3240":"While microbial activity might have a potentially dramatic impact towards silicate reactivity and CO2 sequestration in basalts, the magnitude of this impact remains unknown. Here we propose to investigate the impact of Pyrobaculum aerophilum, an Fe-reducing archeal strain recently identified from basaltic geothermal aquifers in Iceland, on the dissolution kinetics of basaltic glass, taken as a simplified model relevant for basaltic environments. This proposal will take advantage of the unique capability of the HP\/HT autoclave available on the FAME beamline to monitor the release and speciation of Fe in the aqueous phase in situ, which we previously successfully used to investigate the dissolution kinetics of Fe-bearing minerals. We expect to get unprecedented data that will pave the way for quantifying the impact of deep biota on silicate reactivity in basaltic settings.","3241":"Interdiffusion occurs when materials with different compositions are exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time. In a diffusion couple of pure Ni and Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 joined by diffusion welding, there's a flux of elements and vacancies. While CMSX-4's alloying elements diffuse into pure Ni, a reverse flux of Ni and vacancies occurs. This leads to Kirkendall-induced porosity near the joint interface, potentially causing joint failure. The porosity evolution depends on material composition, crystallography, temperature, and stress duration. The study aims to investigate similar conditions as a previous study (ME 1513) but with a Ni\/CMSX-4 joint with different crystallographic orientations and annealing times. Combining the experimental \u00b5-tomography data with the phase-field and continuum simulations should provide information into the complicated mechanisms of void  formation, evolution and kinetics of the kirkendall-porosity.\r\n\r\n","3242":"Measurement of some powder samples","3243":"The formation of semi-fluorinated alkanes (FnHm diblocks) stable Langmuir films has been known for decades, but their structure at the nanoscale has been only recently elucidated. FnHm diblocks self-assemble at the air-water interface into regular, monodisperse arrays of hexagonally-packed hemimicelles 25 nm to 40 nm in diameter, depending on the chain length, as probed by GISAXS and GIXD. We study mixed binary films of different F8Hm (m between 14 and 20). From thermodynamic measurements, the films might comprise either a segregation of pure hemimicelles, either a mixture of pure or mixed hemimicelles. We intend to perform GISAXS and GIXD experiments to elucidate the structure of the mixed films and determine the intra- and intermicellar structure of the mixed monolayer, towards a better understanding of, and thus ultimately controlling, the mechanism of formation and self-assembly of the hemimicelles.","3244":"CO2 methanation (CO2 + 4H2 \u2192 CH4 + 2H2O) is a promising strategy for chemically storing renewable H2. For this reason, we have developed a highly active inverse ceria-based catalyst, CeO2\/Co. In our previous studies, a clear oxidation and unit cell parameter expansion of ceria was seen in H2 atmosphere, indicative of Ce-hydride (Ce-H) formation. Our results suggest that this species might play an important role in the catalytic properties of this system. However, we have not yet been able to perform operando experiments on catalysts with and without Ce-H. Here, we propose to use XRD to determine the varying Ce-H content and transition metal (TM) oxidation state of catalysts and link it to the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst for CH4 formation.

While the genetics of many HMD are known, and novel medical treatments are in Phase III clinical trial, there is need to understand how this relates to changes in microstructure. In this proposal, we aim to perform multi-scale phase contrast tomography (X-PCI) on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies from HMD patients with known genetic mutations, and further assess whether myocyte and microvascular organisation relate to disease category and genomics, as suggested by our pilot studies. This information will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of HMD and provide crucial information for interpretation of future ultrafast imaging studies.","3247":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate the self-assembly process and lyotropic liquid crystalline nanostructural formation of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) upon mRNA complexation, on a millisecond time scale using the rapid mixing stopped-flow device combined with the time-resolved SAXS capabilities of the high brilliance ID02 beamline. Driven by the successful clinical use and the exceptional potential of LNPs for mRNA delivery, this proposal will investigate the millisecond kinetics and structural formation of mRNA binding with a range of clinically relevant ionizable LNPs, including the BioNTech\/Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (ALC-0315 and ALC-0159), and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (SM-102 and PEG-DMG).","3248":"High pressure superhydrides provide an exciting route to finding room temperature superconductivity. Currently, LaH10 holds the record for the highest experimentally confirmed critical temperature (Tc) at a pressure of 200 GPa. It is now important to find high Tc superconducting materials at lower pressure. We will synthesise and study the ternary hydride LaBeH8, which has recently been predicted to have a Tc of 192 K at 100 GPa, and to be dynamically stable down to 20 GPa. We will use laser-heating and X-ray diffraction to search for avenues to synthesise LaBeH8 and will probe the range of dynamical stability. Based on this information, we will prepare high quality samples for electrical measurements at the University of Bristol. This project offers the prospect to achieve a record Tc below 20 GPa. Furthermore it will help to understand the mechanism behind superconductivity in hydride compounds.

Unlike hole-doped (Ba1\u2013xKx)Fe2As2 (K-BFA), Ca and K do not occupy crystallographically equivalent sites because of the large differences in their ionic radii. CaKFe4As4 hosts a superconducting (SC) ground state with Tc = 35 K. By transition metal doping, it is possible to tune the phase diagram away from the ideal alkaline earth metal hole doping (K-BFA) and out of the SC dome. By hole-doping with Mn and Cr, the SC is suppressed more quickly than by electron doping with Ni and Co. This resembles the existence or not of SC ground state for these transition metal dopings on the BaFe2As2 parent compound. We wish to study the RIXS spectrum of the parent compound as a function of momentum and compare it to theoretical calculations to motivate the study of magnetism and its interplay with SC on the doped compounds.","3255":"Amorphous materials such as polymeric, colloidal or spin glasses are thermodynamically out of equilibrium materials. Such materials undergo aging, a microstructural evolution under quiescent conditions, wherein their free energy decreases with time [1]. Aging can be altered by training the material with a succession of small amplitude creeps and relaxations without breaking the material such that the material reaches deeper minimum in its free energy landscape than it would during quiescent aging.  Overaging has been extensively studied in colloidal glasses and leads to a higher material elasticity and a slowdown of the relaxation time scales. Yet, overaging in colloidal gels is not fully documented (no dynamics measurements). Here, we aim to show that the training of colloidal gels leads to overaging  using rheology coupled to SAXS and XPCS. We will vary the training protocol (to test for efficiency) and compare two gels: carbon black gels and ludox gels to go for universal trends.","3256":"The objective of the experiment is to determine the aging of Fe and Mn precipitates forming a coating on grains in rapid sand filters. Rapid sand filtration (RSF) is a widely used technology in drinking water purification to remove NH4+ , Fe2+ and Mn2+ via oxidative processes. It has been found that the removal performance of RSFs changes over the duration of implementation, in particular for Mn. Effective oxidation of Mn2+ in RSFs requires microbial and surface catalysis. More particularly, Mn-oxides formed by Mn2+ oxidation can be effective catalysts for Mn2+ oxidation. We hypothesize that aging and alteration of Mn precipitates, forming the reactive coating around sand grains, contribute to the subsequent decrease in Mn removal efficiency. To test the hypothesis, we will combine XRF and XAS analyses of coatings obtained from RSFs of different operation lifetime. ","3257":"The aim of the present proposal is to study the gradual uptake of hydrogen by manganese and to synthesize the predicted MnH7 [5]. This superhydride structure is remarkable by having a mixed H sublattice, with one hydrogen being under the molecular form and the other ones under an atomic form. By measuring the excess volume per H atom from the compression curve, we will question if MnH7 can be considered an additive-volume alloy of Mn and metal H, as for all other superhydrides [6]. Finally, we will investigate if nuclear quantum effects can change the sequence of the MnHx compounds stable under pressure: in particular, cal-culations predict that MnH4 is stable but probably not MnD4 [5].","3258":"Scanning experiments on 3D printed polymer structures of RM82 liquid crystal elastomers","3259":"Lithium-ion batteries continue to revolutionize the modern landscape; with ubiquitous applications in aerospace, consumer electronics, grid storage, and\r\n powertrains for electric vehicles.

HEAs consisting of PtPdFeCoNi have recently been synthesized in one phase using the incipient wetness synthesis approach. The main aim of this proposal is to investigate the process of leaching and degradation on two different synthesized HEA and compare them to the monometallic Pt counterpart. The results will be accompanied by ICP-MS, STEM-EDS, and IL-TEM to understand the leaching and degradation of these. These mechanisms will be compared to DFT calculations regarding the stability of HEAs.","3261":"The present proposal aims at getting access to the dynamic of TET amino peptidases by determinating the structure at various temperatures of one hyperthermophilic TET peptidase, called PhTET3, isolated from the archaeon P. horikoshii.","3262":"The aim of this in house research experiment is to evaluate the speciation and the local environment of Mo and Pd in petrolchemical spent catalysts based on alumina (Al2O3) with metal on surface, and W, Zn and Pb in pyrochlores treated with solutions containing heavy metals.

We want to collect high-resolution Mo, Pd, Zn K-edge and W, Pb L-edge XANES and EXAFS in order to characterize the local structural environment and the oxidation states of those cations. We also propose to collect XRF maps. We will use transmission mode for the samples with high metals concentrations and fluorescence detector system with a multielement high-purity Ge detector for diluted metals. Accurate information on the local structure and the oxidation state are essential to find suitable recovery procedures to recover metals from industrial wastes and avoid their dispersion in the natural environment.","3266":"In this experiment, the submicron mechanisms underpinning the stabilisation of a natural quick clay using a unique Supplementary Cementitious Material (SCM), a natural calcined clay, will be investigated. The critical processes in these materials are governed by the particle size (nm - \uf06dm) and therefore necessitate the high-resolution and fast phase contrast holotomography on saturated samples without detrimental sample preparation, possible only at ID16B. Scans on samples from ex-situ experiments will be compared with data on the intact material and the binders. This comparison will bring unique new insights into the evolving 3D morphology, starting from the natural state and ending with a fixed stable clay sample. Thereby, the experiment addresses fundamental mechanisms that make natural quick clays unstable, as well as engineering input in using calcined clays to stabilise natural quick clays: fixing clay with clay.

For this purpose, we would like to perform systematic operando XAS and XRD experiments during different reaction conditions simulating daily start-up and shut-down (DSS) operation (variation in temperature and gas atmosphere). We plan to monitor the structural evolution of the active species by XAS measurements at the Ni K and Pt L3 edges, while the overall phase changes due to de-alloying and re-incorporation in the support material will be tracked by X-ray diffraction measurements at selected stages of the experiments. After focusing on the support role in our previous proposal (CH-6791, to be performed in October 2023), we now aim to elucidate the effect of the Ni-Pt alloying degree on catalyst activity and stability.","3271":"The aim of this research project is to determine the influence of synchrotron radiation on the induction of radiation damage in selected model protein structures in the presence of copper, zinc and other divalent metal ions.

XRD will be used for characterization of electrode microstructure evolution under conditions of supercapacitor operation in several types of electrolytes (H2SO4 and alkali metal salts) with progressively large size of ions (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, KI). Evolution of Mxene structure will be studied by following effects of swelling, intercalation and de-intercalation of ions as a function of applied voltage, change of charging polarity and repeated cycling. Degradation of Mxene in a set of electrolytes will be studied using stepwise increase in applied voltage from 0.5V up to 1.1V to reveal limits and mechanism of Mxene electrode degradation. Detail characterization of Mxene electrode structure is extremely important for understanding the fundamental mechanism of supercapacitor operation and for improving energy storage parameters.","3273":"After nuclear accident, non-soluble radioactive particles serve as an additional source for human exposure to radioactivity, when transferred to agricultural\r\ncrops. The foliar transfer mechanisms of such source into plants are poorly assessed by risk assessment tools which includes retention, incorporation and\r\ntranslocation. The transfer is tuned as a function of plant and particles interaction. Thus, properties of particles like size and charge, and those of plants like\r\nstomatal size, leaf hairs and cuticle thickness will determine fluxes distributed on and within plant, that would be able to translocate later.\r\nTherefore, because of the lack of data regarding the transfer of non-soluble particle, CeO2 particle with relevant size range (10 nm- 50 nm and 460 nm) will be\r\nused as proxy to non-reactive particles for plants exposure. This approach will allow us to identify the location and speciation of particles using multi-X-ray techniques like \u03bcXRF and \u03bcXANES on the ID21 beamline.","3274":"Ceramic materials present an elastic-brittle behaviour at room temperature, leading to fracture before any sign of plasticity. This is linked to the low mobility of dislocations, compromising any ductility as is the case of metallic materials. Some zirconia-based ceramics can exhibit real plasticity at room temperature thanks to a martensitic phase transformation mechanism (tetragonal to monoclinic), similar to the transformation induced plasticity in shape-memory alloys. \r\nWith a stress and\/or temperature-controlled phase transformation as a source of toughening, zirconia doped with cerium oxide ceramics are particularly remarkable, with a plastic deformation on the order of one percent before rupture and lower sensitivity to the presence of defects. To fully describe this behavior, we conduct an in situ heating experiment with 3DXRD and DCT analyses, mapping out the strain tensors, as well as crystallographic orientations during the reverse phase transformation.\r\n","3275":"With the proposed experiment we aim to systematically monitor the amorphous structure of compacted glasses induced by X-ray irradiation (virtually in-situ) and by temperature (in-situ) via combined X-ray Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to reveal the glasses\u2019 short and long range order, respectively. From preliminary synchrotron experiments on shock compressed vitreous silica we observed structural changes depending on both the irradiation time and annealing. Interestingly, the structural relaxation by irradiation is not reaching the state of the incompacted reference glass. In comparison to a glass which was ex-situ relaxed by a temperature treatment, one can see that it follows a different relaxation kinetic. Hence the ultimate goal of this study is to understand the initial structure of the compacted glasses, their structural relaxation path and potential structural intermediates.

We plan to image the (106) magnetic Bragg peak to observe the evolution of 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains in real space, complemented by collecting normal charge (116) Bragg peaks below and above TN = 225K. The two peaks will provide information on how magnetic domains evolve as a function of temperature, and how they are pinned to any defects in the lattice or are confined by the crystal morphology.

Our recent studies on ZIF-8 revealed that the flexibility of the lattice is a crucial factor in determining other properties of the material like the intrusion pressure and the size of the hysteresis. Additionally, the quality of the sample turned out to be important in determining stability under applied water pressure.\r\nUnfortunately, the intrusion pressure of ZIF-71 at 70 MPa is above many sample environments, therefore out initial structural studies were carried out only in the pre-intrusion region.

In order to investigate the growth mechanism of CNNTs and the interaction between Zn and conjugated C-N networks, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments are of importance to explore the electronic structure and local coordination state of Zn species in CNNTs.

Using Drosophila as our model, we aim to understand how X-ray stimulation, which activates photoreceptors like visible light, adapts synaptic transmission. Employing high-speed X-ray imaging and electroretinograms, ERGs, we will analyse photoreceptor terminal activity with Drosophila's consistent eye layout aiding synapse identification.

Germination speed is dependent on the seed endosperm which allows the root to protrude through still largely unknown mechanisms. Using histochemical staining we observed that several species including Arabidopsis thaliana accumulated iron (Fe) close to the site of germination in the endosperm layer. Previously, we have shown that two metal transporters, VIT1 and MTP8, determine Fe accumulation in the Arabidopsis embryo. We now found that these proteins not only determine Fe accumulation in the embryo but also in the endosperm which impacted the germination speed of these seeds. We aim to use synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping to explore Fe in the endosperm of Arabidopsis wild type and the mutants in depth. This study will link Fe homeostasis to seed germination for the first time and explain the genetic mechanism behind it, potentially opening new avenues to improve seed quality for achieving higher yields in agriculture.","3298":"Among several materials proposed for safe and efficient solid-state hydrogen storage, alloys and intermetallics are the most promising candidates. We are currently studying the series of bcc (TiZrNbHf)80V20-xTax (x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20) high entropy alloys forming high-capacity hydrides. Despite the same initial bcc lattice and close chemical composition (80 %), the phase transition pathway during the reaction with H is different: H absorption in V-rich and Ta-rich alloys shows one and two-step reaction, respectively. However, it is not clear yet, which parameters influence this phase transformation: electronic properties, local structure, or lattice strain. Thus, we propose to study here the phase transformation at local level in this series of alloys during the first H absorption\/desorption by in situ X-ray total scattering and associated PDF analysis. This will help understanding the H absorption pathway at local level for further design of high-capacity materials.","3301":"We propose a propagation phase contrast synchrotron radiation X-ray micro computed tomography (PPC-SR\u00b5CT) study of an unreported Early Cretaceous mammaliaform fossil which is a new docodontan species. This fossil is superbly preserved with articulated cheek teeth and skeleton, and soft tissues including fur, whiskers, and claws. The best voxel size of mainslab\u2019s previous lab-based CT was 27 \u00b5m, which was not enough to identify the key morphological details. A recently acquired counterslab has yet to be CT scanned. With the requested PPC-SR\u00b5CT of 9 shifts on BM18, we will image the complete specimen from the two slabs separately, at a 10 \u00b5m voxel size, and acquire specific regions at a voxel size ca. 1 \u00b5m. The higher resolution scans will include teeth, middle ear, carpals and articulation, tibia tissues and possible gut content remains. The purpose is to restore the biology and lifestyle of this new docodontan, and further advance our understanding of the early evolution of mammals.","3303":"We propose to investigate the dynamics of ultrafast and non-reversible photo-induced phase transitions using the \u201cstreaming crystallography\u201d technique developed during our previous beamtimes (CH-6492 and CH-6162), that enables real time study of photo-induced phase transitions in molecular materials, within or outside thermal hysteresis. Previous experiments on Co-doped MnFe Prussian Blue Analogues revealed that conversion is completed within 200 ps, with global symmetry change driven by elastic cooperativity. Investigations at variable temperatures show only a very gentle effect in the transformation dynamics. To get better control of the phase transition, we propose here to modulate elastic properties of the crystals, by varying its composition (through doping) and by switching from bulk to surface excitation. Additionally, measurements will be performed on spin-crossover compounds, where the phase transition can occur with or without symmetry change, depending on composition.","3305":"The goal of this experiment is to obtain information regarding the stochastic behavior of VO2\u2019s insulating and metallic domain formation as a stimulus, current, is applied. By analyzing the 1D spatial maps collected in this experiment, we will be able to understand the metallic domain relaxation process as a function of current. This local nanoscale structure information will then be compared to the global resistive state of devices. We expect to see nanoscale filaments, formed by metallic puddles, connect the two metal leads as a result of the voltage pulses. Our collaborators intend to utilize these characteristics to fabricate neuromorphic and synapse-like devices for computational purposes. \r\n","3307":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials that are composed of metal ions connected with organic ligands leading to an ordered pore topology. Recently, we have developed a novel technique utilizing epitaxial substrates which promote in-plane nucleation and growth of 2D zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) and succeeded in solving the structure of our 2DZIF film, which is different from its known 3D analog. We have extended the crystallization strategy to other promising MOFs (UiO-66-NH2, ZIF-7, CALF-20, MIL-53, MIL-101). Owing to the fact that MOFs are not stable under electron beam, we could not get the comprehensive understanding of 2D MOF structure including the in-plane and out-plane information. In particular, we are very interested in solving their crystal structure to understand the similarities and differences of the structure of 2D films and their 3D analog, and the correlation between orientation of 2D films and their underlying substrates.","3308":"Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the mineralogy of aqueous systems remains vastly unexplored at high pressures and low temperatures, even for common solutes such as NaCl or MgSO4. Investigation of the crystallographic diversity of these systems is motivated by the upcoming exploration of icy ocean worlds of the outer solar system by ambitious space missions such as NASA Europa Clipper and ESA JUICE. Deeper understanding of aqueous systems at low-temperature high-pressure  can also provide fundamental thermodynamic knowledge applicable to cryobiology, organ and tissue preservation technologies [5].  Our group has identified several uncharacterized hydrate phases of common and relevant aqueous systems using a high throughput isochoric high pressure chamber. We intend to obtain in-situ single crystal X-Ray diffraction data on these new hydrate phases at high pressure and low temperatures  in order to refine their structures and determine their stability range.","3309":"The electronic nematic phase, which is believed to be a precursor to the superconducting state in high-Tc iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), remains strongly debated. When electronic nematic fluctuations emerge, they reflect on the local environment by imposing subtle lattice modifications not resolved through the average structure. Total scattering studies are sought for a high-Tc (38 K) molecule-intercalated FeSe, where the increased interlayer distance decouples the Fe-selenide sheets, making it an ideal candidate to bring local structural instabilities into light. The experiments will make a model-dependent assessment of the local structure through PDF analysis. The aim is to conclude if the emergence of electronic correlations is responsible for symmetry-lowering transitions at the local level, akin to those accompanying nematic order in FeSCs. The work will shed light on the nature of nematic state and its relationship to the origin of superconducting pairing mechanism.","3313":"Lipid-porphyrin conjugates (Lip-Por) are unique compounds that can self-assemble into liposome-like structures named \u201cPorphysomes\u201d. Herein we synthesized unprecedented smart Lip-Por conjugates that can form stable monolayer. Upon illumination, the Langmuir Isotherms of these conjugates is modified which can be related to their structural changes upon illumination. The aim of the proposed project is to assess the structural changes upon illumination of the monolayers made either of pure conjugates or their mixture with cholesterol, by analyzing the vertical fine structures of the monolayers but also the density profiles of the sulfur groups present in their structures and ions present in the buffer before and after illumination by the unique combination of X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXF) at the air\/buffer interface respectively.","3314":"PLGA-NPs represent a promising class of nanomaterials with versatile applications in the fields of drug delivery, biomedicine, and biotechnology. The biodegradability, biocompatibility, and tuneable drug release kinetics of PLGA-NPs make them attractive candidates for drug encapsulation and delivery systems. However, one of the main obstacles for using NPs as drug carriers in clinical settings is the uncertainty about how they interact with proteins in the blood. These interactions can indeed modify both the behaviour of NPs, in terms of their efficacy in drug delivery and safety, and the functionality of the interacting proteins. In this project, we propose to investigate, with synchrotron Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering, the structure of different types of PLGA-NPs in the presence of different amounts of BSA. As a result, we will obtain information on the protein corona as well as on the dissociation constant and the Hill cooperative index that rule the NP-BSA interaction.","3315":"Thermal expansion represents a problem when dimensional stability of structures or devices is desired in applications that undergo a temperature fluctuation. Therefore the control of thermal expansion represents a challenge for materials design and the negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials are essential to achieve this goal. Recently, we have found out a novel YbNiAl4 family which exhibits NTE in a wide temperature range. Moreover, the NTE can be suppressed or, more interestingly, enhanced, by replacing some chemical elements (Figure 1), thus allowing the control of thermal expansion. Because there is no idea about the origin of this intriguing thermal expansion behaviour, we aim to investigate the local structure, valance state and local dynamics of these YbNiAl4 compounds by means of temperature-dependent XAFS spectroscopy. This would help to shed light on this interesting phenomenon, providing an important step towards the design of controlled thermal expansion materials.","3321":"The aim is to follow the microstructure of novel thermoresponsive hydrogels made of magnetic nanoparticles (akaganeite or nontronite) and Pluronic PF127 copolymer in order to develop cost-effective, and biocompatible hydrogels with multiple stimuli-responsive characteristics. Preliminary rheological experiments reveal a non-monotonic behaviour for storage modulus and gel strength as a function of the temperature. Incorporation of NPs alters the gel network formed by PF127 micelles leading to a transition from a liquid to a strong gel mediated by a soft-gel state, whose microstructure remains unexplored. We propose to investigate the relationships between the structural organization changes and rheological properties, during in situ thermal treatment of hybrid hydrogels with and without the presence of a magnetic field. We expect to improve the understanding on the enhancement of strength and flexibility of PF127 gels with the presence of nanoparticles.","3325":"The goal of this proposal is to characterize the structural evolution as a function of pressure at room temperature of a prototype 2D chiral perovskite, namely\r\nClMBA2PbI4 (ClMBA= chloro-methylbenzylammonium) in the two enantiopure samples (R and S) and in the racemate. The structural study will be coupled\r\nto the spectroscopic measurements as a function of pressure, in particular circular photoluminescence (CPL), to fully characterize the behaviour of these low\r\ndimensional hybrid perovskites upon compression and unveil the evolution of non-linear optical properties and chirality transfer induced by the chiral cation.","3326":"The protein carH associates with the B12 vitamin to form a light-sensitive gene repressor in bacteria. The gene repressive state in the dark binds to the DNA as a tetramer. The light triggers the dissociation of the adenosyl group from the cobalamin, the coordination of the cobalt to the H132 of carH and the dissociation of the tetramer. We recently obtained time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS) results regarding the tetramer to monomer transition of a truncated form of carH (TtCBD) but we still lack information about the oligomerization change for the full-length carH and for two other variants, the TtH132A mutant and the HmCBD homologue. To this end, TR-WAXS will be used on ID09. Preliminary results on TtCBD show the presence of two structural intermediates relaxing within 3 ms and 300 ms before the tetramer dissociation occurs. We aim at collecting data on the other carH variants for long time delays ranging from 100 ms to 5 s as recently achieved on ID09 for TtCBD.","3327":"The project aims to elucidate the 3D organization of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) amyloids. These fibrils responsible for the onset of Isolated Atrial Amyloidosis (IAA), a localized form of cardiac amyloidosis primarily affecting the heart atria.\r\nIAA is characterized by the deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in the atrial tissue of ANP, a hormone synthesized by the atria. ANP fibrils lead to the disruption of tissue architecture and electrical conduction. Structural information on the architecture of ANP fibrils is lacking, hindering a deep understanding of their interaction with the environment and the mechanisms leading to the formation of the fibrillar structures.\r\nAdvancements in helical reconstruction procedures in cryo-EM and in extraction techniques of ex-vivo amyloid fibrils offer opportunities to explore the structural characteristics of amyloids. This research could pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions and improved diagnostic strategies for IAA.\r\n\r\n","3329":"Characterization of Al 2050 alloy, check Eiger vertical flip, s3DXRD experiments and XRD on aerofoils ","3330":"The aim of this proposal is to perform ultra-high-speed X-ray in-situ imaging of rapidly running cracks under impacts in (porcine and artificial) bone + scaffold systems.

We hypothesize that the organic phase in the pellet is: i) controlling P release; ii) preventing inner pellet P precipitation; ii) and bocking the P adsorption sites in the soil. We propose to employ the \u03bc-XRF and \u03bc-XANES techniques available at ID21 to investigate the P physical-chemical dynamics within and around the fertilizer pellet. The high sensititivity chemical maps recorded at a micrometer spatial resolution, combined with the P chemical speciation will  allow us to test the above raised hypotheses, provide insights on the working mechanisms, and help to stablish a rational roadmap to improve this green and sustainable technology. ","3336":"measurements to complete user experiment","3338":"Due to its long half-life and high activity, 79Se is an important radionuclide to monitor for a correct assessment of the safety of nuclear waste repositories. Selenate [Se(VI)], the most oxidized form of Se, is an anion with high mobility in the pore waters of the clayey formations that will host the French repository for high-activity and long-life nuclear waste. It is known that magnetite, a Fe(II)-bearing phase present as a result of the corrosion of the steel canisters, can reduce selenate to elemental Se, a non-mobile solid species. Here, we aim at studying how carbonate \u2013an ion present in the pore waters of the repository- and Fe(II) \u2013an ion present due to the corrosion of the steel canisters- can affect the reduction kinetics of selenate by interactions at the magnetite-water interface. The presence of these ions could pose kinetic barriers for the reduction. Assessing this risk is essential for reliable assessments of the safety of an underground repository.","3340":"Three novel sandwich structure configurations are investigated: i) metallic faces with metallic foam core; ii) metallic faces with aramid paper honeycomb; and iii) aramid fabric faces with aramid paper honeycomb core. Main objective is to define the core's behavior during high-rate compression. In previous tests two collapse modes were identified, but due to the inability of applied testing methods to visualize events in-situ, the sub-surface behaviour is not known, hindering the comprehensive understanding of the collapse mechanism. To address this, we will use  synchrotron MHz X-ray phase contrast imaging (MHz-XPCI) measurements coupled to the Split Hopkinson Compression bar (SHPB) to  track in-situ damage propagation of the core and compare energy absorption and pressure attenuation properties of specimens.The obtained results will be of great importance for refinement of sandwich typologies and for calibration and improvement of accompanying numerical models used for their design.","3341":"Gas hydrates, found in pressurized environments like Earth's seabed or icy bodies in our Solar System, are able to efficiently store fuel gases like methane or hydrogen. In the HC-5060 experiment, we discovered a new high-density C3 hydrogen hydrate (H2O\u00b72H2)  in temperature-quenched, laser-heated samples at P>40 GPa. This phase has the highest gravimetric hydrogen density (>0.25 kg\/L) reported up to date. This proposal aims to systematically investigate its pressure-temperature stability range through in situ laser heating X-ray diffraction experiments. We seek insights into its formation mechanism, whether it results from solid-solid phase transition or direct crystallization from the solution. Understanding this compound's stability, structures, and formation mechanisms is crucial for explaining its role in exoplanetary dynamics, icy body formation, and high-density hydrogen-bearing materials' agglomeration.","3342":"The versatility of Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) in disentangling the properties of elementary excitations is established to investigate the cuprate high-temperature superconductors (CuSC). In these materials, charge and spin degrees of freedom are intertwined and give rise to a complex phase diagram [1]. Here, we propose RIXS experiments of both Cu L3 and O K-edges for 3 compositions of hole-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 (Bi2212) to examine the evolution of spin and charge excitations across the charge-ordered and Fermi liquid regions of its phase diagram. We will probe paramagnon and charge excitations with a focus on the latter, specifically on the evolution of the recently discovered acoustic plasmon branch of the charge excitations in hole-doped cuprates [2].","3347":"The corrosion of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel in the presence of a radiation field is a reaction that is important during both burning of a fuel in a reactor and in the long-term storage of spent fuel. We will investigate this reaction by using synchrotron x-rays to both drive the radiolytic dissolution and measure x-ray diffraction and reflectivity. To effectively drive radiolysis, we use ~14 keV beam at grazing incidence to the sample surface, with water held on the sample surface by a Kapton water tension cell. This is the same methodology as used for A28-1-1358 on BM28 (17 - 24 May 2023). We will expand on this method by also investigating the possibility of doing in-situ spectroscopy measurements simultaneously. The samples used will be thin films of UO2 and U3O8, both of which will have activity below 1 Bq.","3348":"We propose to study the active state of 5 wt% Ru on different metal oxide supports at typical NH3 cracking conditions and compare its activity with bimetallic catalyst based on transition metals (Co-Fe, Co-Ni, Co-Mo) supported on MgO. XAS-XRD in combination with mass spectrometry is an excellent combination for studying the local environment of the metals in these catalysts at industrially relevant conditions. The state of Ru, Co, Fe, Ni and Mo, potential deactivation due to sintering, and the influence of metal-support interactions will be explored to find suitable catalysts for producing N3-H2 mixtures as carbon-free gas turbine fuel.","3349":"Crucial to the spectacular evolutionary success of modern birds is their uniquely efficient respiratory system. Dinosaur skeletons show that this system first appeared in fossil ancestors of birds. However, its earliest evolution is cryptic and poorly understood. We will break a current impasse by analysing the internal histology of bones of dinosaurs and their relatives, searching for a recently identified hard tissue that is correlated with the presence of this system. This tissue type is normally identified through destructively sampling fossils, limiting its use in rare and scientifically significant specimens. We aim to test whether synchrotron tomography is able to detect this bone tissue, which is composed of tiny asbestiform densely packed fibres of <60\u03bcm, providing a non-destructive way to study this tissue. Our work will reveal the early evolutionary history of bird respiration, answering key questions about the success of dinosaurs, birds and their kin.","3352":"Experimental studies on high-pressure dolomite breakdown to aragonite + magnesite carried out over the last 20 years have shown discrepancies. As part of the sediment pile, high-pressure marbles are often present in ultra-high-pressure (UHP) terranes that experienced burial to more than 100 km in continent hypercollisions. Since this discovery the potential of carbonate minerals as UHP indicators has been outlined. Therefore, it is fundamental to elucidate this reaction, which has a >2 GPa uncertainty along the fast subduction pressure \u2013 temperature path that corresponds to UHP terranes. Here, we propose to bracket the dolomite breakdown reaction using materials that have been previously used for the studies that showed discrepant results. By combining in-situ phase diagram study and structural (ordering) study of the various dolomites, we will elucidate this reaction and to propose a robust guide to interpret high-pressure marble occurrence in continent hypercollision zones.","3353":"The oxidative activation of Cu-exchanged zeolites with O2 is a crucial step in tailoring the performance of the material in the conversion of CH4 to CH3OH. However, most studies focus on the reaction with CH4, leaving key aspects of the O2 activation process unrevealed. Time-resolved in situ Cu K-edge XAS is a versatile technique to determine the oxidation state of Cu species as well as changes in the local environment upon exposure to O2. Therefore, the scope of this proposal is to study the processes taking place during the activation of three different Cu-containing zeolite topologies, namely MOR, CHA, and MFI, to assess the structural parameters of active sites and their precursors. The three frameworks are known to stabilize chemically different monomeric and dimeric Cu(II) active sites, making them suitable model systems to study the formation of Cu(II) species. The advance in understanding the active site evolution will enable an additional rationale for materials design.","3354":"The project focuses on the development of multilayer Laue lenses (MLLs) for ID13. Previous experiments have already shown focal spot sizes down to ~23 nm with diffraction efficiencies up to about 29 %. The main instrumental goal of this LTP is the development of two types of MLL optics, namely (i) \u201cvery long-distance\u201d with a focal length of up to ~150 mm, a working distance of >100 mm (@ 12 keV) and an optics aperture of up to ~ 200 \u00b5m \u00d7 200 \u00b5m and (ii) \u201ca new high resolution\u201d lens pair with a focal spot size down to half of the present value, reaching ~10 nm. The MLLs will be used to perform (i) in-situ micromechanical tests on thin films and fibers using a dedicated indenter and (ii) in-operando electro-chemo-mechanical tests on solid state batteries (SSBs). For this purpose, the indenter from MI-1355 will be further developed by implementing new sample mounts, wedge and flat-punch tips and tensile option. Additionally, an adaptable in-operando cell to test SSBs will be designed.","3357":"We will study topological defects in smectic liquid crystals on the scale of a single defect or of a very small number of defects, using nano-diffraction on a thin\r\nfilm (8CB smectic liquid crystal) made of topological defects oriented by a rubbed polymer substrate.

We will scan in 2D, the scanning perpendicular to the oriented defects, both in GISAXS (reflection) and in TSAXS (transmission), allowing for a full reconstruction of the smectic layer distortion, topological defects determination and nanoparticle assembly orientation. Data analysis will take advantage of the methodology previously established in previous average measurements, allowing for a future automatic analysis of the nanoscale scanning.\r\n","3358":"The aim of this project is to combine highly complementary imaging methods \u2013 i.e., scanning small angle x-ray scattering, fast bright field microscopy and visible light fluorescence microscopy - for the structure determination of components inside biological cells, in particular the cytoskeleton and the nucleus. Importantly, the planned setup will in the future be applicable to a multitude of different sample types, from biological to soft matter and hard condensed matter. Our focus for the upcoming three years will be on (i) model cell lines with a pronounced keratin network, and (ii) biologically relevant heart muscle cells with and without desmin mutants that cause cardiomyopathy.

To achieve this, region-of-interest X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) scans will be conducted on a pin-type Panasonic CG-320B battery, which has a small outer diameter of approximately 3.5 mm. Despite its diminutive size, this battery incorporates the same technology (jelly roll) as its larger counterparts. The objective is to achieve a high-resolution visualization of the secondary particles within the LiCoO2 positive electrode at two battery states (charged\/discharged) and gain a unique insight the Li-ion heterogeneities we have previously first reported at the electrode level.","3362":"A large body of work has been devoted this last decade to membraneless organelles, also called biomolecular condensates, which turn out to ensure a number of essential functions in cells. Notably, they enable biochemical reactions involved for instance in metabolism, homeostasis, stimulus response but also pathological processes such as fibrillation and virus production. Unlike membrane-bound compartments, the formation of these condensates can be viewed as phase separation of fluid mixtures occurring within the active environment of living cells. The chemical reactions hosted by the condensates consume fuel and release waste that are externally adjusted, thus driving the system in a nonequilibrium state. The objective of this project is to investigate the phase separation kinetics of bioinspired condensates under either passive or active conditions, that is, when phase separation is driven by free energy minimization or biochemical reactions, respectively.","3364":"The kagome lattice geometry can give rise to dispersionless spin or electron manifold states, which can develop emergent quantum phases such as the fractional quantum Hall state or unconventional superconductivity. In the metallic kagome ferromagnet Fe3Sn2, we observed a flat spin wave band showing unconventional amplitude in the long wavelength limit. While the energy of the flat band and the dispersion of the acoustic mode follows a simple nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, another dispersive optic mode, which is also predicted in the model, is not resolved due to the limitation of the resolution. This mode and its amplitude is very important for the comprehensive understanding of the unconventional behavior of the spin waves. Thus, we propose to study the momentum dependence of the spin waves in Fe3Sn2 with high-resolution RIXS. The results will determine the spin Hamiltonian of this material and develop our understanding of the exotic spin and electron states in kagome magnets.","3366":"Hydrated tectonic plates sink into the Earth\u2019s mantle at subduction zones, leading to the deep transportation of \"water\" in minerals like serpentine to depths exceeding 250 km [~8 GPa].

However, we currently lack any direct information on the influence of temperature as well as variable foliation on the elastic properties of natural serpentine. Our proposal aims to conduct in-situ acoustic measurements of compressional (Vp) and shear wave (Vs) velocities that precisely locate seismic anomalies in P and T space of powdered and variably foliated serpentinite by using state-of-the-art in situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with simultaneous ultrasonic interferometry and imaging at ID06-LVP, ESRF.

Inspired by these bacteria, we developed a synthetic route emulating the bacteria\u2019s proteins with charged polymers inducing a biomineralization-reminiscent crystal formation. Using in-situ SAXS and ex-situ cryo-XANES, we elucidated the gained control via a kinetic stabilization of a transient iron phase, also observed in the bacteria. While new evidence shows that this stabilization is based on an electrostatic polymer-precursor interaction, different polymers show deviations in the final nanoparticle morphology. We accordingly propose an in situ SAXS study to monitor the formation of magnetite nanoparticles, with a primary focus on characterizing the weakly scattering, pre-nucleation iron species.

Now, we've synthesized 2D films of MOFs such as UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, and Zn2(bim)4, alongside COFs, achieving superior molecular separation. However, their crystal structure remains undetermined. This proposal seeks beamtime to elucidate the structures of these newly synthesized 2D films using advanced techniques previously successful at the BM01 facility of ESRF. Additionally, we aim to explore the novel heterostructured 2D ZIF\/COF film, emphasizing the substrate's role in defining 2D film structures.","3371":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3372":"Botanical collections (herbaria) are unique archives for botanical research, which help preserve plant genetic resources and biodiversity. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) was widely employed to botanical specimens to prevent samples\u2019 degradation [1].

The closest fossil relatives of tetrapods are the elpistostegalian fishes, large predators from the Devonian period that were probably capable of moving over land. However, while their pectoral fins already begin to resemble tetrapod forelimbs, the smaller and more fish-like pelvic fins are very poorly known. This hampers our understanding of their locomotion. A recent paid-for experiment, IN-1148, scanned part of the best-preserved elpistostegalian fossil (a complete Elpistostege watsoni, MHNM 06-2067) and revealed a unique pelvic fin anatomy: adapted to movement on land, but not tetrapod-like. We now seek beamtime for a complete scan of the whole pelvic region. This will greatly improve our understanding of elpistostegalian locomotion and the beginning of terrestriality.   ","3375":"The proposal is focused on exploring the behaviour of carbonaceous material for fabrication of anodes for Li-ion batteries. The intended aim is to study the structure evolution of the porous, activated carbon when exposed to a binder or different binders, to explore how the pores change after exposure. The interaction with the binder can reduce the electrolyte-accessible pores, affecting the obtainable capacitance from ion adsorption\/desorption. We plan to do SAXS  experiment to reconstruct pore size and shape after exposure to different binders.

We aim to acquire high-resolution 3D X-ray fluorescence (3D-XRF) data from two types of coccoliths (holococcoliths and heterococcoliths) that represent two morphologies: expected calcite habit and asymmetrically grown crystals. We will use the acquired data to correlate Ca\/Sr distribution with our previously obtained 3D nanoscale strain maps. We expect that the results of this proposal will allow us to elucidate the role of elemental heterogeneities in the biological control of strain and crystal morphogenesis.","3378":"In this work we aim to study the electrode\/electrolyte interface of the Li metal batteries, where two types of the active materials \u2013 LiNiMnCoO2, LiMnFePO4 \u2013 will be analysed at different stages of the battery charging process. The electronic state as well as the local geometry of the elements of interest will be probed at the electrode (sub)surfaces by applying the following synchrotron radiation-based techniques ex situ: XAS and XES at ID26 beamline, XPS and XRD at SpLine beamline, where each of these techniques provide unique information on the state of the material and complement the other ones. The obtained results will shed light on the complex processes taking place at the interface during de-lithiation.    ","3380":"How far can we push the resolution of X-ray fluorescence tomography? Let's find out.","3381":"The zinc-ion battery (ZIB) is one of the promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices beyond lithium-ion technology owing to the earth\u2019s abundance of Zn materials, low cost, moderate toxicity, and high volumetric energy density (5855 mAh cm-3). However, to date, technical challenges remain to hinder the practical application of ZIBs. One of the most notorious issues is dendritic formation during the battery operations. The over-growth of Zn dendrites may pierce the separator, and cause battery short-circuiting and failure. Herein, we propose to use the specially designed Swagelok-type Zn cells with various electrolyte for X-ray imaging observations. We aim to dynamically characterise the Zn deposition and dissolution by fast synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (SXCT), thus providing crucial information for battery optimisation. The results will contribute to developing the next-generation ZIBs with longer life and higher performance.","3385":"In the framework of novel clinical approaches to preserve fertility of young women undergoing oncological therapies, our research focuses on the study of human ovarian tissues at the nanoscale. This proposal is the continuation of the beamtime LS-3190, successfully performed at ID16A beamline last semester. Relying on the valuable 3D information provided by X-ray nano-holotomography, this new project aims to study with sub-cellular detail human ovarian tissues subjected to transplantation in mice models following cryo-conservation procedures. ","3386":"A very recent breakthrough in superconductivity research has led to the discovery of high temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity with a maximum of Tc of 80 K in La3Ni2O7 single crystals under high pressure. This discovery marked the first experimental evidence of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates, making La3Ni2O7 the second system after cuprates to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above the boiling point of nitrogen (except hydrates that show high-Tc at ultra-high pressures). However, many basic properties of this compound need to be systematically studied under high pressure and low temperature to understand the origin of its conductivity. Here, we propose to perform Ni K-edge XAS investigations to understand the evolution of local atomic (e.g., Ni-O, Ni-Ni interactions) and electronic properties (e.g., valence, 3d orbital configurations) of La3Ni2O7, across its superconducting transition.","3387":"Photo-switchable magnets offer unique magnetic memory storage capabilities. However, their technological application is hampered by low operating temperatures, with the best system to date showing photomagnetic switching only below 93 K. Further improvement of such photomagnetic systems is limited by poor understanding of the photoswitching mechanism in cyanometallate assemblies. Previous photocrystallographic studies for octacyanomolybdate(IV) led to the identification of light-induced Mo-CN bond breakage as the main cause of photomagnetic activity, but such behavior was never observed for octacyanotungstate(IV) compounds in the solid. The main difficulty in such studies is the polycrystalline nature of octacyanotungstate(IV) photomagnets. The aim of this proposal is to investigate structural changes with synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, for a new photomagnetic coordination polymers, which exhibit light-induced magnetic ordering at record temperatures up to 110 K.","3390":"The mineralogy and phase transitions in the upper mantle have been determined from models that rely on seismic data and high-pressure experiments. However, these experiments have been run at temperatures ~500\u00b0C hotter than the ambient mantle. This significantly hinders our understanding of the minerals present and their phase transitions at temperatures along the oceanic geotherm. We propose to conduct high-pressure multi-anvil experiments combined with in-situ XRD at ID06-LVP using a fertile mantle starting material to recreate the subsolidus conditions of the mantle transition zone (16-21 GPa and 1400-1600\u02daC). The goal is to determine the minerals present across the P-T range of the mantle transition zone and constrain clinopyroxene to majorite transition and verify the occur of two majorites. This will allow us to refine the phase diagram for the upper mantle which has implications for the interpretation of seismological observations of the mantle and thermodynamic models.","3394":"In this experiment we will characterize the Cd-K edge shell of altered CdSeS pigments bound with different materials: lineseed oil, acrylic and vinylic. The pigments will be analyzed both in Fluorescence\/Trasmission and TEY. XANES and EXAFS spectra will be collected at the Cd-K edge to observe a change in the interatomic distance with the aging process. Cd-K edge is extremely important as this element is bound both with Se and S in the first shell, and will help to evaluate a change in their environment.","3395":"We propose in-situ time- dependent X-ray radiography and nanotomography experiments on hierarchically porous silicon and silica membranes. The tomography should reveal the structure of the hierarchally porous membranes and complement the in-situ radiography data. With the in-situ X-ray radiography we want to explore the capillarity-driven water infiltration and the advancement of the imbibition front as well as its drying. Both utilized in combination, tomograpphy and in-situ radiography, can give a full explanation of the material's inner structure and the resulting transport kinetics as well as a full image of the interconnectivity within in the hierachically porous network. ","3396":"We propose conducting in-situ XRPD experiment to investigate the P-T stability and structure of CaSiO3 polymorphs and their destabilization phases in the P\/T range of 0-15 GPa and 300-1500 K, corresponding to Earth's upper mantle and transition zone. Existing research point to the intricate nature of the phase diagram of CaSiO3. It reveals the presence of apx. five distinct polymorphs characterized by tetrahedral silicon units, with stability observed up to approximately 8 GPa. Beyond, there is a transition to a mixture of Ca2SiO4 and CaSi2O5 phases, the crystal structures of which may still be undetermined. These phases hold significant importance as accessory components within the Earth's mantle and are frequently encountered as inclusions in diamonds. Reconstructing the precise phase diagram, including the crystal structures and the pressure-temperature stability ranges of each phase, will contribute to a more accurate understanding of the depths at which diamonds originate.","3397":"The aim of the project is to investigate the local structural evolution of photoluminescent inorganic materials, i.e. Eu3+-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO4), during high temperature annealing. We are focused on unravelling to which extent different synthetic approaches, i.e. inverse miniemulsion (wet-chemistry) and ball milling (solid state-chemistry), affect the local structure of inorganic materials in particular during the annealing. We aim to evaluate the dopant-induced variations on the structure (electronic, short- and long-range) through a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (at Eu L3-edge and Mo K-edge) and X-ray diffraction in situ measurements while annealing at 900 \u00b0C, both in He and in air. With these findings we aim to thoroughly understand the reversible structural and electronic changes occurring during the annealing process, which are found to strongly affect the photoluminescent (Eu2+-Eu3+) properties, to a different extent depending on the synthetic route.","3399":"this experiment is preliminary experiment to study the sodiation on and hard carbon electrode ","3400":"Chiral Blue Phase liquid crystals, BPLCs, have unique 3D cubic crystal structures and ultrafast response times to electrical fields. Many efforts are underway to develop photonic or optoelectronic BPLC devices but are hindered by narrow BP temperature ranges, widened by adding polymers or nanoparticle, NPs. Inorganic NPs are also added to increase functionality and lower high driving voltages needed for display applications. We previously showed that 4 nm gold NPs in BPLCs reversibly form giant 3D cubic crystals but apart from our study, the NP spatial distributions, important for applications and understanding BPLC properties, have not been characterized. Small angle Xray scattering, SAXS, will be applied to study the effect of the NP size and shape on the NP spatial distribution and BPLC thermal stability. ","3401":"The pressurised intrusion of non-wetting liquid in nanoporous materials has emerged as a promising mechanism to yield high-performance energy absorption and impact protection. Herein we propose to use in-situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at beamline ID09 to study Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) under high-rate water intrusion driven by mechanical impact. The aim is to determine the precise structural evolution of ZIFs and liquid molecule distribution inside, and examine any dynamic effect or intrinsic timescale that determines the energy absorption performance in practical applications.","3402":"Radiation damage is a major limitation in protein crystallography, especially at room temperature (RT), which can lead to incorrect biological interpretation.. Cryo-cooled samples (~100K) have now been used for decades to slow down its progression (~100 fold compared to RT) but such cryo-protection reduces the functionally-relevant conformational heterogeneity of the crystalline sample. \r\nRT data collection recently rejuvenated, through the advent of serial crystallography, in which the X-ray dose deposited on the sample is spread over a large number of microcrystals (typically tens of thousands). In a seminal experiment on ID13, we were able to characterize the progression of radiation damage at RT. However, with the recent EBS upgrade, a 10-fold increase in photon flux density has been obtained on ID13; we therefore propose to reproduce the experiment in these new conditions, to fundamentally understand the mechanism of radiation damage progress at such extreme photon regimes,.","3403":"Our BAG was created in 2006 to federate well-established structural biology laboratories from south Paris. At present, several projects are investigated by different teams from 5 Institutes: (1) I2BC (Institut de Biologie Integrative de la Cellule), (2) IBPC (Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique), (3) INSERM (InstitutNational de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale), (4) LBPA (Laboratoire de Biologie et Pharmacologie Applique#e) and (5) CiTCoM (CiblesTherapeutiques et Conception de Medicaments, ex-name LCRB).\r\nOur research area focuses on many important biological systems involved in human pathology or infectious diseases, including molecular chaperones, DNA recombination, RNA maturation, ribosome biogenesis, telomerase assembly, bacterial toxins, malaria disease, neurodegenerative disease, drugs resistance and cell-signalling.\r\n","3404":"Almost all skeletal tissues record visible marks such as Lines of Arrested Growth (LAGs) that form annually during the unfavourable season. The identification of LAGs serves in palaeontology to calculate individual ages and to model the growth of organisms. However, sometimes bone growth slows down without ceasing, which implies LAGs are not systematically formed in bone tissue. Accordingly, this leads to the construction of inaccurate growth models. However, these seasonal modulations in bone growth are produced by internal physiological changes in the body, so that what is not recorded structurally could nevertheless be recorded chemically. Previous experiment (ESRF BM23 beamline ES1272) revealed for the first time in fossil dinosaur bones that these LAGs corresponded to marked enrichments in strontium (Sr). In order to validate these data and propose a biological model for Sr incorporation into bone tissue, it is crucial to perform the same analyses to bones of modern vertebrate.","3405":"We study 4-n-octyl-4\u2019-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) smectic (Sm) liquid crystal (LC) \/nanorods (NRs) composite thin films. The aim is to obtain NR assemblies of controlled order and orientation, capable of inducing highly anisotropic optical properties. For gold NRs, the desired features are the optical plasmonic absorption of light but also the local exaltation of electromagnetic field, which both become sensitive to the incident light polarization if the NR assembly has high order and well-defined orientation (fig1c) [1, 2]. For fluorescent NRs the emission polarization is parallel to the NR\u2019s long axis (fig1b), requiring a unique and well-defined NR orientation so as to reach macroscopic anisotropy [3,4]. We thus create oriented topological defects (TDs) in thin 8CB Sm films that confine NRs in their cores leading to original NR assemblies and related NR optical properties (fig1b-c).","3406":"Ni-based heterogeneous catalysts have attracted attention because of their relatively low cost and intriguing structure-sensitive effects. However, the study into size effect below 2 nm is still lacking since the preparation of sub-2 nm metallic Ni is extremely challenging. Via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method, we have successfully synthesized a series of evenly size-distributed Ni nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) on Al2O3 with the average size from 1.4 nm to 4.3 nm. By conducting ex situ as well as in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments, we can obtain insight into how the support can stabilize the small size Ni-NPs, and identify the speciation of these Ni catalysts especially under working state. With the combination of in situ XAS with other spectroscopic, microscopic and physico-chemical characterization techniques, as well as the evaluation results on these materials, we will have promising approach to the understanding of the Ni-NPs size effect in CO2 hydrogenation.","3407":"We have recently shown that the MAP6d1 protein is the first neuronal protein able to form microtubule doublet structures in vitro. In agreement with the in vitro data, we observed that in neurons, MAP6d1 colocalises with the basal body and the proximal segment of the primary cilia where microtubule doublets are specifically present (article in preparation). Another striking structural feature of microtubules polymerized in vitro by MAP6d1 are microtubules with luminal protofilaments which have never been described before. The aim of this proposal is to explore the whole microtubule architecture of murine neurons by collecting high resolution cryo-ET data from neurons grown on microscopy grids and investigate whether microtubule doublets are present in other compartments than cilia and where microtubules with inner protofilaments are observed in neurons.","3408":"Epitaxial SrIrO3 and CaIrO3 thin films on STO(001) substrates crystallize in the perovskite structure and both display paramagnetic and semimetallic behavior. We successfully synthesized epitaxially strained thin films of the substitution series CaxSr1-xIrO3. A non-monotonic evolution of the out-of-plane lattice parameter is found, which for low x increases with respect to that for pure SrIrO3. Interestingly, this strained state for x>0.1 is accompanied by the occurrence of an anomalous Hall effect contribution below 50 K, which suggests the emergence of ferromagnetism. However, the ferromagnetic signal could not yet be confirmed by bulk magnetization measurements probably due to the small magnetic moment of the Iridium atoms. We propose XMCD measurements to investigate the Ir ferromagnetism and characterize the strain-induced phase in CaxSr1-xIrO3 for few selected concentrations x.","3409":"We propose to investigate the gut of a murine model (SAMP8) of age-related human frailty syndrome to identify pathological alterations by means of nano\r\n X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT). The samples will be measured at different time-points from pre-symptomatic stages to detect and monitor the age-related impairment of intestinal barrier, which is indicated as a disease-relevant site by preliminary data obtained at the ID16 beamline. Since SAMP8 is a\r\n promising model for sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), we believe that the experiment could help to identify predictive signs of structural alterations as frailty indicators of progression to AD in the mouse, especially at the earliest phase of the disease.","3410":"The aim of the proposal is to carry out pair distribution function (PDF), XANES and EXAFS analyses on Mn-doped halide double perovskites (HDPs), in form of bulk and nanocrystals, characterised by persistent luminescent (PeL). Remarkably, PeL disappears at room temperature (RT) moving from bulk to nano-structured samples in Mn2+doped Cs2(Na1-xAgx)InCl6 compounds. The origin of this behaviour has not yet been explained and our proposal aims to shed light on this phenomenon. The PeL is due to traps, that could be local structure defects. So, an in-depth characterization of the local structural properties by EXAFS and PDF is required to reveal how the structural defects change from bulk to nano, impacting PeL. Moreover, given that PeL is influenced by temperature, XAS could give us meaningful information at low and high temperature. Adding this info to our existing knowledge will enable us to achieve PeL in nano halide perovskites, with greater applicability.","3411":"We propose to extend structural investigations of microcrystals localized on TEM grids towards measurements at ambient conditions and low temperatures using the nano-focus setup of beamline ID11. Rare-earth metal pnictide chalcogenides REPnCh (RE = La-Nd; PnCh = BiSe, BiTe, SbS) will be\r\ninvestigated at temperatures down to 90 K to examine the formation of charge-density waves. Microcrystalline compounds of the Ta\/Cu\/S system obtained by the\r\ndecomposition of the thermoelectric material TaCuS3 will be measured at low-temperature conditions to investigate the dynamical disorder of Cu atoms.","3412":"A key task in volcanology is correctly interpreting volcano monitoring signals in terms of magma migration to the Earth\u2019s surface. The microcrystals and pores in volcanic rocks record crucial information on magma ascent dynamics. X-ray microtomography enables their effective examination, providing direct 3D imaging of rock microstructures at high resolution. However, cutting-edge phase contrast X-ray imaging and phase retrieval methods, available at synchrotrons, are sometimes needed to properly investigate these rocks due to limited density and chemical contrasts between microcrystals and surrounding matrix glass. We intend to apply these approaches for a systematic analysis of rocks erupted during reference eruptions of the Campi Flegrei caldera, one of Europe's most dangerous volcanoes, in an unrest phase since 2005. Our aim is to obtain a comprehensive dataset on its magma ascent mechanisms and timescales, useful to reconstruct pre-eruptive scenarios and interpret monitoring data.","3413":"The proposed experiment is aimed at studying crystallization mechanisms of semi-crystalline multiblock polyurethanes using ultra-fast chip calorimetry. The studies will be focused on newly synthesized polyurethanes based on poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) as the soft block and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) as the hard block. We are going to perform time-resolved in-situ SAXS\/WAXS experiments to address details of competitive crystallization of soft and hard blocks as a function of chemical composition and thermal history. In addition, using ultrafast heating and cooling we are going to analyze phase composition of the samples containing both PBA and PCL blocks.

It is suggested that the nano-ECN not only provides excellent load bearing capacity but also constrains the dislocation motion for a profound Hall-\r\nPetch strengthening at elevated temperatures. For quantitative validation, we would like to perform XRPD experiments to evaluate stress partitioning between\r\ndifferent phases and evolution of dislocation structures via refinement and fitting of diffraction peaks in real-time during high-temperature loading in the AM alloy.\r\nThe results are expected to give a deep understanding of the microstructure-properties relationships in the thriving AM materials and promotes their engineering\r\napplications.","3415":"This project focuses on O3 type layered transition-metal oxide cathodes Na0.9Mn0.48Fe0.3(Cu\/Zn)0.22O2 for Na-ion batteries.

We expect to distinguish the role of these TMs in the overall charge-storage mechanism and identify their influence on cycling stability in terms of voltage polarization, TM migrations to sodium layers and anionic redox. Our findings will provide guidance in future materials design and optimization for higher-energy Na-ion batteries.","3416":"AES measurements will be carried out on FeS2 samples to double check old measurements carried out during CH6699. X ray beam is not necessary. H2S gas will be used.","3417":"Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising technology for the production of de-carbonized hydrogen 1. However, the development of PEMWE is hindered by the low efficiency of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), currently catalyzed by IrOx particles. The annealing of IrOx electrocatalysts has been shown to improve stability at the cost of decreased OER activity. This tradeoff is in response to the annealing's effects on the morphology and the nature of the surface oxides2,3. To determine which parameter (the material structure4, the initial Ir oxidation state5, or both) controls these two antagonist properties, we have synthesized a library of IrOx nanocatalysts with tailored crystallite size, Ir oxidation state, and degree of crystallinity. We propose to investigate their structural and morphological changes operando in the recent PEMWE cell developed at ID31 and to bridge this unique information with the changes in OER activity and stability.","3418":"Current industry standards rely on a multi-step energy intensive process to convert methane into methanol, while soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) enzymes are capable of converting methane to methanol under aerobic conditions and ambient pressures and temperatures. The structure of the methane activating intermediate sMMO-Q has been intensely debated as being an open or closed \u2018diamond\u2019 core for decades. Efforts to understand the catalytic cycle of sMMO have led to an abundance of molecular mimics, including work on a complex capable of performing temperature dependent reversible O-O bond scission by Kodera et. al, which features a high spin diiron(IV) state. In light of recent work by our research group, such temperature dependent behavior is uniquely poised to help understand the structure of sMMO-Q. We propose to apply Fe K-edge HERFD XANES and VtC XES for the study of these molecular model complexes.","3419":"The recent discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 with a Tc close to 80K at pressures above 14GPa has generated considerable attention and calls for further investigation of the underlying mechanism. While the structure of the high-pressure phase that accommodates superconductivity could only be guessed from powder diffraction and theoretical calculations, a detailed single crystal diffraction study would provide the necessary structural details to prove the hypothesis that superconductivity is enabled by a strong mixing of nickel and oxygen orbitals. To address this aspect, we propose a detailed quantitative analysis of scattering intensities that allows not only to resolve structural uncertainties but also enables a direct visualisation of the electron density redistribution across the superconducting phase transition using multipolar refinement and refinement of experimental wave functions. ","3421":"Being pristine samples from depths that we cannot reach, mineral inclusions in natural diamond have attracted much interest for their potential to shed light on the composition of the Earth interior and the process of diamond formation. Sulphide inclusions are very common and have been studied to understand the occurrence of sulphur and chalcophile elements in the mantle.  Sulphide inclusions are still studied mostly ex situ, employing destructive techniques that necessarily cause the loss of information regarding the relationship between the host and the inclusion, and often risk to provide only a partial sampling of the inclusions. Thus, we propose to couple diffraction and tomography to characterize the inclusions without breaking the diamond host. This approach will allow us to identify the phases entrapped in the inclusions, evaluate their morphology and orientation, to get  insight into the growth environment  and on the time of formation of host-inclusion pair.","3422":"Magnetic hyperthermia is a therapy that aims to kill cancer cells by delivering heat to them. The heating agents employed for this treatment are magnetic nanoparticles, which are internalised by the cells, and heat up when an alternating magnetic field is applied. One of the magnetic nanoparticles currently being studied for biomedical applications are magnetosomes. These are magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles synthesised by magnetotactic bacteria, which exhibit excellent heating efficiency. However very little is know about the fate of magnetosomes once they are inside cells, which is of high relevance if they are to be approved for clinical use.

Samples were subjected to a controlled thermal gradient ranging from ambient temperature to 200\u00b0C. At each 20\u00b0C increment, the samples underwent high-resolution nano-tomography scanning with a pixel size of 50 nm. The resulting data provided detailed three-dimensional images of the mudstone's internal structure, allowing for precise quantification of nano-structural changes.","3424":"We have recently shown [T.

These non-canonical DNA structures play vital roles in biology such as regulation of gene expression and telomere maintenance. While their thermodynamics are understood, their kinetics, especially in competition with WC dsDNA, are less explored. We plan to use a visible-light-sensitive photoacid to induce pH changes with a nanosecond laser and monitor dsDNA dissociation and i-motif and G-quad formation kinetics with TRXSS.

Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in the central one-third of either half filament and bridges thin and thick filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments, conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in specific proteins.","3429":"PDF measurements of zeolite and MOF powders","3430":"In the past seven years, the PI, in collaboration with ID06-HXM staff and the DTU, has led advancements in DFXM achieving 100 nm resolution in 3D imaging of crystalline materials.

This samples were sourced from the sample return mission \u201cLuna-24\u201d in 1976. Recently there has been much debate about the origin and formation mechanism of nano particular Fe0 and FeIII respectively. The overall concentration of both phases is too low in the powdered Luna-24 sample which makes the focussed study of them difficult. By studying single grains rich in Fe instead of the diluted powder it is expected to gain novel knowledge of the occurring phases and their formation. By using SMS it is possible to do spatially resolved measurements of the single grains.

It is also likely that cavitation will occur during high-velocity impacts, contributing to the formation and propagation of cracks and shock waves. However, at these concentrations, shear-thickening fluids become opaque, hindering the visualisation of crack formation with conventional imaging techniques. We therefore propose to perform high-speed in-situ X-ray imaging of shear-thickening fluids impacted by high-energy shocks to study the formation of cracks in such mixtures and the possible onset and dynamics of cavitation bubbles.","3457":"Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is a promising pathway to convert detrimental CO2 emissions into sustainable chemicals. The use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) fed by gaseous CO2 enables achieving high activity and selectivity, albeit with limited stability.

Strikingly, preliminary pulsed electrolysis experiments show that (bi)carbonate precipitation can take place without losses of GDE selectivity, leading to a 10-fold increase in GDE stability.

In that context, studying the stress distribution of the coating before and after irradiation is of prime interest. However, the prediction of the coating plasticity and mechanical behaviour in the system Cr coating\/Zr-alloy substrate is an open issue that requires numerical simulation. The objective of the experiment is to quantify the stress redistribution induced by the irradiation (of the coating) in order to validate numerical simulations. For that purpose, 2D and 3D elastic strain maps (within the Cr coating), built from Laue images, are acquired for different ion irradiation doses. For that experiment, a polychromatic beam (5-22 keV) and highly focused (500x500 nm2) beam, together with an efficient 2D detector, is required.","3728":"Many biological systems evolved unique ways to assemble multi-hierarchical structures with functions ranging from sensing to light manipulation. To harvest the full potential of the bio-inspired structures it is important to understand the underlying processes of their formation in biological systems. We will study topological textures in multi-hierarchical photonic structures of butterflies to understand their role and mechanism of their formation. We aim to acquire high-resolution tomograms of naturally grown gyroidal and ridge-like photonic networks (ca. 300-500 nm unit cells) and their domains (10-20 microns). We will use the acquired data to: (1) perform Landau phase-field modelling to understand whether the topologies are emergent or induced by the organisms; and (2) simulate the photonic properties of the topological textures to understand whether they are coherent with surrounding structures or carry their unique optical signatures.","3729":"An original method of compliant epitaxy, known as Nano-Pendeo Epitaxy, has been developed for achieving low dislocation density GaN and\r\nmanaging the strain into the nitride layers. Initial thin AlN and GaN layers are grown on silicon on insulator (SOI) layers, before being patterned into nanopillars. The degrees of freedom in rotation acquired by the nano-pillars allows the crystallites to align crystallographically at the time of coalescence, therefore without creating defects. This alignment is explained by a reduction of interface energy between adjacent crystallites slightly misorientated before coalescence. To go further quantitatively in the understanding of the crystallite alignment mechanisms at work and feed our numerical simulations, we would like to follow before and after coalescence of the nano-pyramids, the average evolution of the mosaicity and twist within a vignette of nano-pillars.","3735":"Cu-based electrolyzers allow high-rate CO2 electrolysis (CO2E) to value-added chemicals. However, they still suffer from a lack of stability and high selectivity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) instead of CO2E. Both issues are believed to be due to insufficient water management. Our theory is that too high a water content in the catalyst and gas diffusion layer is limiting CO2 mass transfer, leaving HER as the only feasible reaction. While our previous work (MA-4791) showed water transport with CO2 electrolysis, the dominant anions are carbonates, and thus the main ion transport through the membrane is carbonate ions. With this proposal, we wish to employ CO electrolysis, as that has similar catalysis as CO2E, but is expected to have vastly different water flux due to hydroxyl groups being the dominant anions. In this proposal, we aim to analyze water flux with COE and relate this to variations in catalytic selectivity as well as relate it to our previous work of CO2E.","3736":"This proposal aims to study the local structure of Pt particles dispersed on CaTi1-xFexO3-\u03b4, with x=0, 2, 3, 4, 7 during CO oxidation.

We believe that this high performance is due to the presence of both, Ti and Fe in the support and interaction with Pt and the support, via oxygen vacancies created through Fe-doping and\/or strong metal-support interaction (creation of Pt-Fe bonds). Using operando photon-in\/photon-out spectroscopy we will study the electronic structure and local coordination of Ti, Fe and Pt.

The membranes will be treated by a combination of detergents, developed in our laboratory, and the various complexes will be isolated. We will utilize membranes isolated from temperature-sensitive mutant developed in our laboratory. At permissive temperature the isolated complexes are indistinguishable from the wild-type organism. In the none-permissive temperature the mutated complexes are depleted affecting the structure of the rest complexes.

They display a wide range of exotic magnetic and electronic low temperature properties, dependent on the specific rare-earth ion, due to the inherent magnetic geometric frustration of the rare-earth and Ir4+ (J = \u00bd) corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices. Surprisingly however, initial magnetic ordering of the Ir4+ sublattice appears to be primarily dependent on the A ion size (and hence the interatomic distances\/compound\u2019s lattice parameter), rather than the rare-earth\u2019s specific electronic properties. To investigate this relationship, we propose to measure the lattice compressibility and the structural evolution with pressure of several A2Ir2O7 members, to allow proper interpretation of property measurements under pressure.

Magnetic materials allow to solve this challenge by employing exotic and stable chiral and topological magnetic states such as spin spirals, skyrmions and bubbles. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often responsible for such topological magnetic states. DMI manifests traditionally at metallic ferromagnet\/heavy-metal interfaces, owing to inversion symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling by a heavy metal. Our recent experimental observations suggest that Neel type skyrmions and bubbles can be induced even in rare-earth yttrium iron garnet (YIG) at room temperature through application of alternating magnetic fields. Here we propose to use resonant X-rays at forbidden reflections (where we are sensitive to the charge, magnetic and orbital ordering) to understand the underlying mechanism.","3744":"Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have recently been gaining scientific interest in many research areas as alternative, more sustainable, liquid media. DESs are prepared by mixing two or more components, the melting point of the resulting mixture being significantly lower than that of its pure constituents. Fusion properties are key for the prediction of the DES\u2019s liquid window. Choline chloride (ChCl) is a solid at ambient conditions and is the most common DES constituent. Its fusion properties are inaccessible owing to thermal decomposition. Here, we propose to use ultra-fast scanning calorimetry in combination micro-XRD to overcome this limitation and elucidate the melting point as well as the high-temperature crystal structure of ChCl and its mixtures. This allows for the correct description of the liquid window for many DESs.

Sp-BCDI is based on modulating the coherent beam wavefront with a phase plate to produce a strongly non-uniform, \u201cspeckled\u201d illumination, that efficiently samples the 3D diffracted intensity around a Bragg peak. This reduces the data acquisition time (down to a few seconds) and enables the imaging of dynamically evolving crystals. We expect to observe the crystal morphology at various stages of dissolution. Exploiting the sensitivity of spBCDI to crystalline distortions we will correlate strain fields and defects to the morphological evolution of the corners and edges during the dissolution.

The transition to more bulk-like systems in which this approximation is violated is poorly understood. In this proposal we aim to explore the interface between TXRF and XRF performed under grazing incidence. Our study will explore the experimental conditions and ranges of validity. The data will be an essential part of a recently launched VAMAS study to explore the feasibility of using XRF under grazing incidence to quantify airborne particulate matter as well as a new work proposal (on 23971.2.2) for an ISO standard \u201cAnalysis of air PM filters by XRF under grazing incidence\u201d launched within the ISO TC201 committee.","3911":"RNiO3 nickelates are referent materials to study the evolution of the physical properties at the crossover from localized to itinerant behavior in highly correlated electron systems. The subtle competition between bandwidth (related to Ni-O-Ni distortion), on-site electron-electron repulsion (U), and charge transfer energy between O and Ni sites produces multiple entangled order parameters in RNiO3. Both, the exact mechanism that drives their unusual MIT as well as the multiferroic properties of the insulating magnetic phase are still under debate. In RNiO3 (R=Yb, Y, Dy and Nd, varying the Ni-O-Ni distortion and the charge disproportionation degree) we aim to investigate their low-temperature structures.

Our previous XRS experiments using modest flux on an ESRF bending magnetic, suggest a tuning of the magnetic correlation length possibly from the modification of magnetic correlation time-scale. The aim of this proposal is to reveal the tuning of the magnetic fluctuations directly using XPCS methods at the EBS.

This is seen clearly in the case of the end-Devonian mass extinction, the first major extinction event after the origin of tetrapods: land plants and non-marine fishes were devastated, and tetrapods may also have been severely impacted - but nobody knows. The reason is that there has been, until now, only a single tetrapod fossil locality with a single tetrapod (Tulerpeton) from the time immediately before the extinction event. During July-August 2022 I led an ERC-funded expedition to Greenland which collected the first extensive tetrapod fauna from the latest Devonian: at least 4-5 taxa represented by well-preserved 3D fossils. I now seek beam time on BM18 to image the most important specimens.

The presence of Nb5+ in substitution of Ti4+ in the anatase TiO2 lattice was confirmed by XPS and XRD. But for the N doping atoms, while they seem to play a key role in the structure\/efficiency relationship, the nature of doping sites remains largely unknown. This is due to the lack of characterization methods allowing to distinguish N from O in this type of structure.

In fact, we have observed evidence of the synthesis of this material ex-situ at 62 GPa in a laser heated diamond anvil cell. However, we need XRD and Raman characterisation before and after compression, laser heating and decompression using the small beamspot and high intensity of the ESRF synchrotron to analyse this high pressure phase transformation of boron carbide completely.","4007":"Near field ptychography precharacterisation, followed by speckle based imaging.","4008":"Combining high resolution RIXS and IXS we have recently unveiled bulk charge modulation in the HTS cuprates oxychloride, close to the 1\/8 doping, where they are most intense, and their interaction with the Cu-O Bond stretching phonon via an intrinsic excitation of the charge modulations, which induce a shift of the phonon softening minimum away from the position of charge modulation propagation vector. To understand the nature of the charge modulation, and their interaction with the phonons, we need to explore how doping modify both the propagation vector and the phonon softening minima. Moreover, we observed that the phonon softening survive in temperature the charge modulation, suggesting its fluctuations are very robust, but we lack a detailed study of the temperature dependence for the phonon softening. We propose to answer these question, and reveal the nature of the charge modulation in cuprate oxychlorides, and their interaction with the Cu-O Bond stretching mode.","4009":"There is great potential for developing carbon-reactive cement using the massive magnesium resources, but we understand little about their hydration and carbonation kinetics to control their macro-level properties. The main objective of this project is to create high-resolution 3D models of early-stage microstructure development (including the sequence of MgO dissolution, precipitation, and nucleation, as well as the changes in pore structures) of MgO-hydromagnesite blend. We will perform a correlative study complementing the NanoCT data with rheology, XRD, and NMR characterization resulting in a descriptive model for the reaction kinetics.","4010":"When it comes to human tissues, the sub-\u00b5m length scale plays a fundamental role in understanding tissue changes, whether it is caused by tumours or other organ-specific pathologies. This proposal aims at performing X-ray speckle-based tomography on samples like ovarian, endometrial, and liver tissues for a deeper understanding of the local changes in the microstructures resulting from a specific pathology (endometriosis, steatosis), a neoplastic transformation, or a cryopreservation procedure (vitrification). To that end, X-ray speckle-based imaging (SBI) has recently shown high potential, thanks to its high sensitivity to small density differences in unstained soft tissues. Unlike other techniques, SBI also provides additional information about small-angle scattering, known as dark-field. With the dark-field signal, it is possible both to improve the visualisation of sub-resolution microstructure alterations and to quantitatively detect the orientation of anisotropic structures.\r\n","4011":"The microbial world is constantly shaping the planet by governing the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. While recent developments in \u201comics\u201d opened a window of the complexity of this world, it is still problematic to attribute a function to a gene product or predict enzymatic reactions simply from its sequence. Then, how can enzymes be studied from uncultivated microbes? In this proposal, we are using an explorative approach to open a new field: the structural elucidation of catabolic enzymes from microbial mesocosms. We will study two models, an anaerobic bioreactor containing a methane-degrading consortium, and a microbial community from wastewater treatment. As a proof of concept, we recently isolated, crystallized, and structurally characterized the methane-generating enzyme from an archaeon\r\nliving in this activated sludge. Now, we will go beyond and isolate more enzymes of catabolic pathways from these \"microbial dark matter\", playing a key role in thecarbon cycle.","4012":"In the experiment we will investigate temperature structural changes in thin films of the high mobility polymer poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT) and its modifications","4013":"Tomographic scans of chicken bones","4015":"Iron is the only geo- and cosmo-chemically abundant element with variable oxidation state that could affect interiors of Earth and super-Earth planets. Recent work of our group and collegues reveal complex crystal chemistry of Fe-O system at pressures up to ~100 GPa. Even at this pressure range information about oxidation state of iron in different geochemically relevant compounds is inconsistent due to severe experimental problems. Aim of this project is to perform parallel single crystal X-ray diffraction  and synchrotron Mossbauer study of three model compounds (ferropericalse (Mg0.8Fe0.2)O, ringwoodite (Mg0.5Fe0.5)2SiO4, and bridgmanite (Mg0.8Fe0.2)(Si0.95Al0.05)O3) at 150, 250, and 300 GPa heated up to ~4000 K. As outcome of this project we will establish if this materials are chemically stable, or what are products of their decomposition, what is oxidation and electronic state of iron in corresponding compounds and if it affected by relevant pressures and temperatures.","4016":"Teach new staff to align the beamline.

Vermiculite [1-3] is a 2:1 layered silicate, composed of 1 nm thin negatively charged sheets kept together by interlayer cations. We have acquired 15 vermiculite samples originating from different areas in the world, and we exfoliated the most of them into the single nanolayers using H2O2. From our previous XPS experiments and diffraction experiment at BM01 beamline in ESRF, we know that the exfoliation process does not work the same for all of these vermiculite samples, and depends on the type of interlayer cation and charge of the nanosheets. Study of kinetics of reaction promoted by heat, will optimize conditions for exfoliation of vermiculite nanosheets to achieve maximum performance of exfoliation process.\r\n","4021":"For decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. CO2, the use of hydrogen as C-free fuel for lean-burn internal combustion engines is regarded as a promising alternative. For such applications, NOx emissions are the only pollutant requiring catalytic aftertreatment. This study aims at understanding the impact of catalyst composition on the behaviour on Pt and Pd active species during selective catalytic reduction of NOx by H2. For this purpose, a series of noble metal (NM)\/CeO2 catalysts containing WO3 or BaO as dopants, will be investigated by spatially resolved operando XAS measurements along the catalyst bed at Pt L3 and Pd K edges.

However, given that fusion reactors operate at elevated temperatures under complex cyclic loading regimes, the fatigue behaviour of the structural steel, EUROFER97, and its relationship with the development and evolution of intragranular stress tensor fields must be evaluated. This is essential for the qualification of in-vessel components and will shed significant light on the microstructural aspects of the mechanisms permitting fatigue failure. Considering the above, we propose to measure both the intergranular (type II) and intragranular (type III) three-dimensional stress tensor fields before and after the fatigue testing of EUROFER97 using scanning 3DXRD and the ID11 beamline.

To our surprise, the domain wall consisted of several Bloch-wall-type segments of alternating polarities. As MI-1429 was a 3D imaging experiment, we did not apply magnetic field to avoid perturbating the texture. Now we would like to do so, in order to elucidate the origin of the non-uniform domain wall polarity. Is this the equilibrium configuration, or does it arise from pinning on extrinsic defects? How does it react to weak magnetic field? Can we eventually manipulate the number of segments, in the perspective to encode information? We will this time focus on a 2D imaging procedure under applied magnetic field. \r\n","4024":"Lipid membranes are highly interactive and the structure of the proteins is intimately connected with the lipid environment. The motion of lipids and proteins occur on time scales from ns to ms. We introduce a model system in which we use photo-switchable glycoconjugates to induce structural changes in a membrane consisting of DPPC to study the lipid-lipid interaction. The reversibly switching of the glycoconjugates results in a conformation change of the molecule. Existing static XRR and GID measurements on mixed monolayers revealed reversible structural changes in the ordering and orientation of the lipids. The observed structural changes suggest a mechanical coupling between the lipids. The dynamic of this coupling is not well understood yet and needs more investigation. This experiment will not only contribute to the fundamental understanding of membrane dynamics but also to potential applications for molecular switches such as drug delivery, cell recognition and optical storage.","4025":"The ability to electrooxidize biomass compounds efficiently and selectively can serve as source of both renewable hydrocarbons and H2 under electrolysis conditions.  Although a host of common anode electrocatalysts have been implemented in biomass oxidation reactions, our group has recently discovered that Cu-based materials, notoriously bad catalyst for water electrooxidation, exhibit enhanced reactivity and selectivity toward biomass.  With this beamtime proposal, we aim to resolve the Cu active site structure in layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalysts using in-situ XAS, providing insights into the design of future catalyst with improved biomass electrolysis properties.","4027":"We propose the study of silica covered Fe2+ triazole nanoparticles (with a diameter of 10-50 nm), which have potential applications as thermally responsive\r\nagents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), by means of temperature dependent XAFS measurements. In the samples under study, Fe forms polynuclear\r\ncoordination complexes with triazole ligands in a chain-like fashion. It is expected that the magnetic and structural properties of the Fe-triazole nanoparticles will\r\nbe affected by the synthesis route, the nanoparticle size, and doping with lanthanide elements. Spectra acquisition at temperatures ranging from 300 K to around\r\n470 K is requested, because various types of temperature-induced transitions take place. At intermediate temperatures order-disorder transition of the chain\r\narrangement may be detectable while in the temperature range 300-350 K, spin-crossover happens.","4034":"Bone toughness depends on the many interfaces joining the different structural units of bone. Among these, cement lines are thin layers separating osteons from the surrounding bone. Cement lines are still one of the least understood features of our bones; yet these structures are believed to play a key role in bone fracture resistance. The main aim of this research is to characterize the mineral properties of cement lines by small and wide angle x-ray scattering with (sub)micrometer resolution to test the hypothesis that cement lines exhibit different mineral particle size, orientation and crystallographic parameters w.r.t. surrounding bone. We assume that such difference, reflected into different biomechanical properties, provides cement lines with the ability to hamper crack propagation. Our findings shall clarify the contribution of cement lines to bone toughness and guide the design of bone-inspired composites, with a tunable fiber\/matrix interface to enhance toughness.","4038":"This experiment aims to utilise the new scout and zoom capabilities offered on BM18 to conduct tomography experiments on full-scale additively manufactured (AM) components. In particular, we aim to map the defect distribution in turbine blade components manufactured using laser powder bed fusion from Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 alloys to understand the efficacy of manufacturing process control algorithms in controlling defect structures in real components. Until now we have had to study defects introduced by AM on sub-scale test-pieces rather than industrial-scale components.  This will enable us to refine and validate control algorithms in manufacturing \u201con demand\u201d full scale components and thereby to engineer the defect distribution to facilitate the uptake of AM for safety critical parts in industry.","4039":"The nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) binds to the 5' cap of nascent Pol II transcripts and co-ordinates their co-transcriptional maturation, transport or degradation.

Two routes can be used to achieve nanosized phosphor particles namely bottom-up and top-down. As part of a PhD thesis, we applied the second one to produce cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce). However, the used grinding process is responsible of a drop of optical properties, which has been correlated with the formation of an amorphous layer at the nanocrystal surface. On the basis of the evolution of UV spectra profile, we postulated partial in-situ cerium (III) oxidation into cerium (IV), which could be concomitant with amorphization. To the best of our knowledge, this doping element valence modification during grinding has been reported for other phosphors, but not for cerium in YAG matrix. Consequently, the goal of the present proposal is to confirm this hypothesis through X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine Ce4+ \/Ce3+ ratio  on milled samples.","4043":"Modulating the conformational dynamics of RNA riboswitches is a promising route toward understanding gene expression and the development of antibiotic alternatives.

However, the unique Gleason grading system has been extensively revised but still constitutes the basis for the WHO-ISUP and serves as a predictive marker established worldwide. Depending on the degree of differentiation, different therapeutic strategies are applied. But the unique clinical and molecular heterogeneity of prostate cancer remains largely unconsidered. However, based on this scoring, no correlation to an overall survival rate can be established to date. This suggests that the two-dimensional examination based on thin slide sections used so far has hidden certain information about the specific carcinoma.

As a next step, we would like to apply this powerful approach to study a Pt\/Al2O3 catalyst. The reaction mechanism is not completely understood and even though Pt is very active, it also suffers from fast deactivation, especially at lower temperatures.

Here, we propose an access route for routine microtomography which is fast, i.e. can be made available on short terms, and requires minimal overheads for the beamline staff. The basic idea is to deploy the robotic sample changer of the beamline which has already proven to be a useful tool during the pandemic where users remotely scanned and changed samples. It can be easily installed, with samples pre-mounted from the users loaded and made available in non-used evening and night shifts in a remote manner exactly like it was done during the pandemic.

Besides, a third CDW propagation vector with QCDW=0 0 \u00bd is observed below 100 K and interpreted as dimerization driven CDW. In this proposal, we want to solve the low temperature CDW phase of FeGe and discern whether dimerization, nesting or a disorder scenario are responsible for the charge modulations reported. For this, hard x-ray diffraction will provide the complete set of data and will allow us to understand the origin of the CDW in FeGe and learn how magnetism intertwins with the charge order.

The latter is particularly important for SSX with respect to radiation damage. Thus, our BAG proposal has two aspects, a technical one, the implementation and comparison of various sample delivery approaches at ID29, using a highly radiation sensitive metalloprotein model system and a scientific one, the structure determination of a predicted but so far elusive flavin N5-oxide intermediate of the enzyme EncM.

Hydrogen sulfide is highly corrosive; therefore, the question becomes whether microbial activity resulting in sulfide production could negatively impact canister safety. Sulfide readily reacts with ferrous iron to produce iron-sulfide minerals.

We aim to further advance the understanding of the formation mechanism of Cu NCs to include icosahedra, 2D plates, rhombic dodecahedra, octahedra, etc. all of which can be synthesized from the same synthetic methods through variation of the nature of one reactant along with the heating conditions. We hypothesize that reaction kinetics regulate the growth of the different shapes. Thus, we propose the systematic investigation of different additives and heating conditions on the reaction kinetics, and how these determine the size and morphology of the Cu NCs.","4099":"PDF measurements of S ions in solution","4100":"Cobalt compounds offer many exciting possibilities in chemical synthesis and catalysis. In order to realize the potential of cobalt compounds, a profound understanding of their electronic structure is required. We use cobalt compunds to the development of new synthetic procedures for organophosphorus compounds. Complexes containing redox-active 1,2-diimine ligands give access to valuable synthetic building blocks for phosphorus chemistry. Unfortunately, the challenging structural characterisation and oxidation state assignment in these compounds hinders further development. This proposal therefore aims at the thorough and precise the structural elucidation of a series of cobalt complexes using XRD. Moreover, the spectroscopic oxidation states of the Co atoms will be determined using K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). These data will give valuable insight into the relationship between structure, reactivity and metal oxidation state in the investigated complexes.","4101":"Time-resolved serial synchrotron crystallography (TR-SSX) poses methodological challenges, yet offers novel opportunities to study structural changes of biological macromolecules at work in real time. Our proposal addresses the former and presents various examples to grasp the latter. We will implement microfluidic, jet-based and solid-support sample delivery methods and combine their use with different means of reaction triggering in the crystalline molecules including rapid mixing and light-illumination. Studies will be conducted to assess specific and global X-ray radiation damage at the unprecedented flux densities ID29 will deliver. TR-SSX will then be applied to several enzymes and light-sensitive proteins to study structural changes on the micro- to millisecond time-scale following reaction triggering. TR-SSX and XFEL based TR-SFX will be compared by conducting a study on the micro- to millisecond time-scale on the same protein crystals delivered to the beam by the same method.","4106":"Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are porous hybrid materials deriving from the combination of organic linkers and inorganic building blocks. Creation and engineering of defects in MOFs offers an additional dimension of opportunities for tailor-made materials, since local defects have direct implications in the resulting properties.

However, home and personal care products still require surfactants formulation, optimized to obtain high-performance products. A fundamental understanding in the self-assembly properties of blends of biosurfactants with industrial surfactants is then necessary. In this proposal, we use a high throughput SAXS beamline to study the phase diagram in water under diluted conditions (< 5 wt%) for mixtures of biosurfactants (sophoro-, rhamno-, cellobiose-, gluco-lipids) with industrial surfactants, negative\/positive\/neutral (SDS, LAS, CTAB, Pluronic P123, F127). This study will be essential for understanding BS\/surfactant blends and sketch their use in commercial formulations in the field of personal care.","4108":"This proposal is aimed at determining the speciation of Co, Ni and V in two petrolchemical spent catalysts based on alumina (Al2O3) with metal on surface. These samples, already well characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EDX analysis with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are currently under investigation to find a green process able to recover precious metals. We here propose to collect high resolution Co, Ni and V K-edge XANES and EXAFS to characterize their oxidation state and local structural environment. We propose the use of fluorescence detector system with a multielement high-purity Ge detector to guarantee successful data collection for the proposed experiment on diluted metals. Accurate information on the speciation is essential to optimize the recovery procedure or to find alternative ways to recover metals.","4110":"Energy storage devices are essential components for the incoming massive electrification of the car fleet.  \u201cAnode-free\u201d battery is the holy grail in battery research domain, where the only source of lithium is initially present in the positive electrode material (e.g. LiNMC). A simple copper current collector is used at the negative side to ensure the Li plating.\r\nIn this work, we propose to investigate the formation and properties of the SEI as function of the (negative) electrode potential (1 to 0 V vs Li+\/Li) in operando mode coupling grazing incidence X-ray scattering techniques with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Additionally, nucleation and growth of lithium (orientation, size, texture) will be analyzed by further decreasing the applied potential below 0 V vs Li+\/Li.

Our \u2018lab-on-chip\u2019 approach consists of a single wafer device in which thousands of identical films are present under different strain conditions, in contrast to state-of-the-art approaches where only single strain levels are achieved. Here, the aim is to apply spatially resolved XAS to chart the structural and electronic property evolution across a broad and quasi-continuous range of strain conditions applied by the lab-on-chip device. By applying this approach for metal and metal halide perovskite thin films, unparalleled laws will be established between (i) the applied strain and (ii) the structure and electronic material properties, ultimately enabling one-to-one links to their performance. ","4116":"X-ray nanoscopy is an imaging approach that is expected to provide numerous answers regarding the structure of matter at the molecular level. Full-field X-ray imaging can reach such resolution if the setup is combined with strongly focusing optics capable of generating the desired magnification. In this kind of imaging approach, the phase contrast modality is preferred due to the fact that, at this scale, samples present very low absorption and therefore low contrast. To the best of our knowledge Dark Field (DF) has never been measured at spatial resolution better than a micron. The ambition of this proposal is to perform speckle-based imaging to extend the DF range to the nanoscale.","4117":"Transparent polyurethane aerogels were synthesized for the very first time in our previous publications. These materials present the lowest thermal conductivity ever measured for this aerogel matrix, according to the literature. To understand and further improve this value it is essential to theoretically model their thermal conductivity. Their porous structure, composed by a pearl-necklace structure with 30 nm-particles and presenting a bimodal porosity (pores below 100 nm) is the main responsible for their great insulating capacity, therefore, providing an accurate model relies on characterizing this inner structure. Thus, the use of the ESRF facilities (synchrotron radiation-based phase-contrast hard X-ray nanoholotomography under cryogenic conditions) would be really useful for this investigation. It will allow to determine for the first time the porous structure of transparent PU aerogels, information of critical importance for the state of the art and predicting their properties.","4118":"The aim of this study is to identify the deformation and damage interactions of aluminium alloy sheets under plane strain tension conditions for different microstructures. Plane strain tension conditions are identified as critical in forming processes as early localization and the lowest deformation at fracture are found under these conditions. Using flat samples with local thickness reductions, the plane strain state can be achieved. In contrast to tomography, in situ laminography allows the evolution of the microstructure and damage as well as strain (via image correlation techniques) to be studied in the plane strain tension zone. In\r\naddition, the role of pre-strain on failure in plane strain tension will be investigated by performing a load path change on a newly designed sample. The role of crystallographic texture, obtained by complementary EBSD, on strain heterogeneity and localization followed by damage and failure will be further investigated by simulations.","4120":"oxidation state in Gd doped CeO2","4123":"Silicon has approximately 10 times the capacity of the state-of-the-art anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). To fully utilise the charge capacity of Si, it is crucial to understand why it loses capacity so quickly when the battery is put through cycles of charge and discharge, and why nanosizing of the Si is effective in extending its cycle life. The best way to gain information about the structural changes during cycling which cause deactivation is by an operando study in a working battery. We aim use total X-ray scattering to obtain the pair distribution functions (PDFs) of working nano-Si anodes. Previous studies of crystalline Si have given some insight in the structural mechanics of cycling, but do not give clean enough data. To mitigate this, we have developed a new operando battery cell. This will then give information about the structural changes of Si combined with electrochemical data.","4124":"Pannexins are large pore ion channels involved in the release of ATP. A congneital mutant of PANX1 is known to block this ion channel. We observed that this happens through a gating residue that shifts into the pore to block the channel. We demonstrated this for our manuscript with a low resolution structure 3.9 angstroms. We would like to obtain the structure of this mutant channel at a high resolution to mark the changes in the channel precisely. ","4127":"Our recently published article in Nature on the origins of endothermy sparked considerable new hope to settle one of the oldest mysteries of paleontology: the origins of mammalian warm-bloodedness (i.e., endothermy). Despite attempting to scan multiple specimens that are in the phylogenetic borderline of Mammaliamorpha, the first synapsid clade retrieved as endothermic, none of those scans did not retrieve usable results. Therefore, our previous analysis only made use of three non-mammaliamorph probainognathian species, which is admittedly unsatisfactory to resolve the debate. Hence, we propose to scan using propagation phase-contrast tomography various key specimens to extract their inner ear anatomy and internal cranial osteology. Thus, through the use of phylogenetic comparative methods, a broad extant baseline comparative sample, and biomechanical principles we can estimate the body temperature of these mammalian ancestors and accurately predict the origin of endothermy.","4128":"The purpose of this proposal is to use Powder X-ray Diffraction to investigate the addition of alloying elements and cryomilling on the formation of the tetrataenite phase in FeNi-based alloys produced by different processing routes.

By performing in-situ tensile tests on fibers exposed to different relative humidity in combination with high fast nanoXRD mapping, we will obtain detailed information on local deformations in the core and the shell layers. Additionally, fibers immersed in water prior to tensile testing will be examined. We will use egg sac SPSI, which has proven successful in cell culture and is very abundant in principle but rarely studied and poorly understood.","4137":"The overall aim of the project is deciphering structures and reaction mechanisms of different cofactor proteins.

Crack initiation and propagation, grain orientation evolution, and brittle-to-ductile (BDT) transition coupled with the H-modified mechanical behaviour will be monitored during the proposed experiment.","4143":"Physical properties of liquid silicates under extreme conditions are of first importance in geophysics, to constrain the early molten stage as well as to understand the seismic anomalies detected nowadays at the Earth's Core-Mantle Boundary.  It is however extremely challenging to measure accurate melt structure over 100 GPa, therefore the analogy with compressed glass is often used. \r\nThanks to the unique capabilities of ID27 High pressure beamline (Multichannel collimator and high brilliance pink beam), our group would like to measure precise structure factor of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 glass up to 250 GPa, to understand the effect of Fe on density and local structure of glass.

They are peculiar actin-binding proteins as they cause F-actin depolymerisation by oxidation of actin residues thanks to the H2O2-producing NADPH oxidase activity of the N-terminal flavoprotein domain, which is enhanced in the MICAL-F-actin complex. The catalytic domain is followed by several domains, responsible of the control of the activity upon interaction with regulating small molecules and proteins. MICALs participate in cell differentiation, migration, division, vesicle trafficking and even gene expression through their actin depolymerising activity or H2O2 production leading to oxidation of largely unknown target proteins. Elucidating the 3D structure of MICAL1 by cryoEM, will clarify the hypothesised peculiar mode of regulation of the activity, and will be key to devise ways to modulate the enzyme activity in the context of diseases like cancer and neurological disorders.","4153":"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a strong neurotoxin and is mainly produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the environment.

These mutants showed specific phenotypes in Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation. Our objective is to identify and quantify the various Hg species in the wildtype and mutants upon Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation. For that, we will use Hg L3-edge High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected -X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) from FAME-UHD beamline that proved powerful to determine Hg species at relevant environmental levels","4154":"We propose to study the H2- and CO-induced structural reconstruction of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) in Ru\/Al2O3 catalysts by time-resolved XRD\/PDF experiments under gas- and liquid-phase conditions.

Yet, a comprehensive description of adsorbate-induced structural change within Ru catalysts is lacking. Although important for industrial applications, restructuring processes are much less explored in the liquid phase. These results will further inform on the comparison of gas-phase and liquid-phase conditions and cover the structural dynamics and kinetics of Ru NPs during the key stages of Ru-hydride formation and CO-induced oxidative disruption.","4155":"Our project is based on the SAXS\/WAXS study of the structural evolution of polymers during a swelling kinetic by scCO2 in order to follow\r\nsimultaneously during the swelling, the relaxation and the crystallinity (when present) by WAXS and the large scale structure by SAXS with\r\npolymers of industrial interest.

We will compare the role of several inhibitors (such as organic molecules, dopant, and polymers) which act as the barrier of the ionic migration. The structural dynamics under different electric field will be captured with both time and diffraction resolution. The full characterization of these phases will provide a mechanistic insights into the pathways underpinning the unwanted phase transformation and degradation, and ultimately allowing us to propose new methods to stabilize halide perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.","4160":"We have built a gas system which can work under 60 bars.

We plan to investigate by means of X-ray absorption Spectroscopy the HEA together with its binary and ternary precursors thus investigating the role of each element and correlate it to the Senkov \u201cmother\u201d alloy. The Senkov alloy family was chosen because it is the most studied in literature from the mechanical properties point of view, but detailed structural information at the atomic scale are still missing.

Recent measurements suggest that the long-range charge ordered phase emerges out of a broader regime characterized by short-range, and possibly dynamical, correlations. However, it remains unresolved whether the emergence develops through a quantum critical point or through a smooth crossover.  As resonant soft x-ray scattering techniques have proved to be one of the most sensitive techniques to probe charge correlations in cuprates, here we propose to study charge order around optimal doping with the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) technique. We plan to add another dimension to the cuprate phase diagram by combining RIXS with application of magnetic field.

Here, we will explore the formation of supramolecular assemblies through the interactions of helical peptides functionalised with non-canonical side chains. Our preliminary results show that different oligomerisation states can be selectively achieved by altering the structure of those side chains. As such, these design motifs can modulate assembly formation, from small oligomers (e.g., dimer, trimer) to higher order structures (e.g., octamer, decamer), as well as the populations of those as discrete oligomers (e.g., 100% pentamer) to co-existing structures (e.g., varied populations of monomer, trimer and pentamer). The proposed experiment aims to provide a detailed picture of the assembly modes, which will aid to develop a general mechanism of peptide association.","4275":"Structured illumination with coded apertures is an efficient method for collecting high-quality X-ray data while reducing radiation dose. These apertures, fabricated using nano-lithography, exhibit minimal absorption at high energies and introduce significant phase shifts in the illumination for dose efficiency. Unlike traditional holotomography, coded apertures eliminate the need for sample motion along the X-ray beam, reducing acquisition time and alignment errors. They also facilitate rapid convergence of iterative algorithms and enable dynamic experiments previously limited by single-distance measurements. At ID16A, we aim to demonstrate the competitiveness of coded apertures compared to multi-distance acquisition, and explore the possibility of single-distance holotomography. For demonstration, we will focus on high-resolution imaging of fruit fly photoreceptor synapses, a challenging application with conventional methods due to low contrast and alignment issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n","4277":"We will use Bragg coherent diffraction imaging to image the mobility of dislocations inside Pt particles during annealing at up to 850\u00b0C.

For water trees to grow they need an initiation site, which is normally an impurity at the interface between the semiconductive screens and the insulation. In our latest work we found that water trees can grow from smooth and clean interfaces, where microstructural and chemical defects lie further away from the water tree inception site than ever seen before. Preliminary work on these samples at ID13 by SAXS and WAXS show that these techniques can provide essential information about the impurities and how they are distributed in the observed microstructural features compared to the bulk. The results from these combined studies will give a fundamental understanding of the mechanism for breakdown of the subsea cables and prove our hypothesis.

Such strain path changes lead to a dramatic change in the mechanical properties and failure, due to reorganization of the already established microstructure of dislocations. The fundamental mechanisms underlying this process have been elusive due to lack of representative data for the microstructure dynamics. \r\n In a recent experiment at ID06, the evolution of 40,000 dislocation cells were visualised. We propose to apply same methodology, but to a sample pre-deformed in an orthogonal direction. Being able to visualise the process provides unique information on how the microstructure breaks up and reassembles. Next, to understand the underlying mechanisms we will introduce a comprehensive DFXM analysis approach that simultaneously maps the elastic strain, the geometrically necessary dislocation density and the total dislocation density.

Its prognosis is very poor, with survival ranging from 12-15 months.  Due to the chemoresistance and highly infiltrative growth of GBM, current treatments can only slow the development of the disease. The main limit to the effectiveness of chemotherapies in the brain is their restricted access due to the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB), which limits the passage of most drugs. Recently, focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with microbubbles, has attracted attention as a non-invasive means of temporarily opening the blood-brain barrier (1). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging is a powerful imaging technique for quantification of trace elements in biological samples. In this study, we propose use XRF to quantify platinum concentrations in the brains of F98 glioma-bearing rats after FUS-enhanced chemotherapy of carboplatin, in comparison to simple carboplatin intravenous injections.","4354":"To explore the behavior of nitrogen under extreme pressures, we utilize non-resonant inelastic X-ray Raman scattering capabilities available at ID20 beamline (ESRF).

Under pressure, delta-N2 undergoes several structural transitions to epsilon-, zeta- and amorphous black eta-N2 at room temperature. Our approach involves two complementary techniques - X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRS allows us to study the changes in electronic structure associated with the pressure-induced transformations in nitrogen. At the same time, XRD measurements will be used to monitor the structural changes in conjunction with subsequent AIMD simulations.

The faradaic efficiencies of formate production never fall below FE(formate) = 95% within an\r\nextraordinarily wide potential window of about 1100 mV. We hypothesize that the broad potential widow of formate production is due to the coupling of two distinct\r\nCO2RR mechanisms taking place (i) on the oxidic Bi2O3 foam (low overpotentials) and (ii) on the metallic Bi foam which forms at higher overpotentials.

This is very surprising since this obviously violates the Tc dome that is deemed a universal trend for cuprates. However, there is still no consensus on why the Tc is so robust in the overdoped Bi2223. Here we propose to use the high resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to examine the T-dependence of charge excitations and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in optimally and overdoped Bi2223, which are reported to entangle with the superconducting phase of cuprates.

Indirect oxidation due to Fe(III)-bearing secondary phases is suspected to be responsible for the poor efficiency of usual reclamation strategies. However, experimental investigation lacking to confirm that such processes are determining the patterns of mine drainage composition after reclamation. We initiated a study of the anoxic leaching of weathered sulfidic tailings from the Doyon mine, Canada, and the Folldal mine, Norway. This proposal aims at using Fe K-edge EXAFS to characterize the secondary, poorly crystalline Fe-species occurring in the initial tailings, as well as Fe-species formed after leaching under anoxic conditions.

In run HC-3952 we extended the investigated pressure range to 166 GPa using YAG laser heating and observed the bcc-fcc transition at two pressures, 100 and 166 GPa. The aim of the present proposal is to map in more details the bcc-fcc transition line from 50 to 200 GPa and extend the melting line measurement of superionic ice up to 200 GPa.

MPT is a diffusionless, often reversible phase transformation between a high-symmetry and a low-symmetry phase. It is the enabling mechanism behind the novel properties of SMAs, switchable multiferroics, and TRIP steels, but functional fatigue continues to be a major barrier. Functional fatigue is caused by stress fields that form at the phase interface and lead to dislocation generation. We plan to use dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) to measure these interfacial stress fields during stress-induced MPT for the first time, using a mechanical load frame.

Indeed, in organisms that natively express them, FLV acts as\r\nan electron acceptor only for a limited time frame, but the molecular mechanism at the base of this regulation is unknown. Therefore, responding to how FLV\r\nis regulated is essential for understanding its biological role and introducing the protein in crops.

In these soils, \r\nphosphorus (P) is not only depleted, but the remaining P is often not bioavailable as most of the soil P is strongly adsorbed to mineral phases. Under such low accessibility, the productivity of tropical plants is strained, and they need to compete or cooperate with soil microorganisms at the microscale to acquire P from the soil. This acquisition is almost exclusively dependent on the exudation of organic compounds into the soil, that liberate P for the plants. To investigate the effect of different organic compounds on soil P microspatial patterns and speciation, we have conducted a 13C-enrichment microdialysis experiment, which simulates root exudation into the soil.

The nitrilases that convert nitriles to carboxylic acids and ammonia form spiral homo-oligomeric structures and, to date, none have crystallized in their complete, active form. The spiral structures are, however, amenable to structure determination by cryoEM and we have determined high-resolution structures of four of them of which one has been published.\r\n\r\nThe enzyme in our current study is an interesting fungal homologue, the cyanide hydratase, which converts cyanide (HCN) to formamide Further study and structural analysis is necessary to elucidate the details of the full reaction mechanism.\r\n","4716":"This study focuses on studying long-range correlations in surfactant multilayers supported in the soft polymer matrix and the process of reorganisation of these layers upon exposure to humidity","4717":"The antiferromagnetic square-lattice spin-orbital Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 has been intensely studied, primarily due to its numerous common features with the high Tc superconducting cuprates. Although the overall energy scale of the magnetic ground state of this system is well described by isotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions, in-plane magnetic anisotropy is known to exist, which leads to a magnon gap. Our recent Raman measurements of the magnon gap under uniaxial stress provided strong evidence that the in-plane magnetic anisotropy is associated with pseudospin-lattice interactions that break the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal lattice implying an intrinsic orthorhombicity of the system.

Most studies on laser peening have used nanosecond pulsed lasers, which require a sacrificial coating as well as a transparent overlay, while recent studies reported that femtosecond laser peening does not need any protective layer. The physical process is very complex and requires a multi-physics approach. To validate model predictions high spatial-resolution microstructure data are needed to compare the dislocation density in the depth of the material with the estimated density from the local pressure in the shockwave. Five different metals will be considered.

However, recently the presence of crystalline defects (called \u2018spherulite\u2019) has been observed in this alloy and it now appears essential to know the actual 3D distribution of spherulites in the manufactured parts. Indeed, we believe there is a critical spherulite diameter beyond which the parts break prematurely with a fully brittle behavior.. This synchrotron experiment should give us elements to rule on the influence of spherulites on mechanical strength and they should give us clues as to the cooling rates to be reached or the heat treatment to control their size\/distribution.

In addition, thermodynamics databases predict a dramatic increase in compression wave velocity, Vp in the \uf062 field with depth, which results in the attribution of high velocity zones in seismic tomography data to the \uf061-\uf062 transition. Therefore, an accurate characterization of the pressure and temperature (PT) position of the transition and the associated velocity changes will provide valuable data for the interpretation of seismic velocities. Here, we propose to investigate the cell parameters of \uf061-\uf062 quartz at ID06 to relate PT to phase change.

Using the ID28 side station beam line we propose to fully characterise the structural quality of this natural quasicrystal. In particular we will quantify the eventual amount of phason strain and phason fluctuations by precise measurement of Bragg peak position and width, and the presence of eventual diffuse scattering.

The operando spectroscopy performed at Ir LIII edge suggest that the oxidation state of Ir depends on Ir\/Pt ratio. Underlying reason for this behaviour is revealed when observing the Ir-O bond, i.e. IrOx-Pt-TiO2 is shorter than analogous bonds in commercial unsupported IrO2. This suggests a strong interaction between Ir and Pt, with the possibility of a bimetallic specie forming. However, due to the proximity in energy of Ir and Pt LIII edge, it is not possible to confirm the presence of a intermetallic specie using EXAFS. Performing experiment at Ir and Pt k edge would be essential to establish the interaction between Ir and Pt, and confirm, or exclude, the presence of bimetallic species at the interface.","4841":"Seasonal waterlogging and\/or drying of Arctic peat soils commonly results in leaching of reduced iron [Fe(II)] and organic carbon (OC).

However, there is a sharp microstructural transition region: the grain structure is distinguished at the interface due to the sudden change in the composition. Such discontinuity brings about the fracture weakness due to the interfacial residual strain. We seek to investigate the interfacial strain field during mechanical loading of this bimetallic structure by using in situ transmission X-ray powder diffraction.

Recent research suggested that the presence of oxidized Pd2+ species is crucial for catalyzing methane oxidation, at least at high temperature. For this reason, we synthesized redox supports consisting of pure and Pr-doped ceria, able to promote the presence of oxidized Pd species. In this project, we will use the LISA@ESRF XAS beamline to investigate the interactions between Pd and Pr-doped ceria. In this way, we will discover how Pr loading affects the chemical environment and oxidation state of Pd species, and how these properties evolve during the catalysis.

In this project, a photoactivated adenylate cyclase (PAC) containing a BLUF sensor domain coupled to an adenylyl cyclase (AC) effector domain is studied. For this, PAC protein was produced, purified and characterized. Structural changes around the FMN chromophore could be elucidated using time-resolved crystallography (TRX). However, structural changes happening in the AC domain could not be observed using crystallographic techniques as the crystal packing is preventing them. We suspect a bigger conformational change is required to activate the AC domain, which could be confirmed using SAXS.

The proposed experiment is the continuation of previous successful experiment that was performed using as-printed LPBF additively manufactured body at the beam-time of Proposal MA5208 awarded by ESRF. Full field eigenstrain reconstruction of residual stresses will be conducted after diffraction data collected from 5 planes and processed using the strain tomography technique. The data collection of this technique is similar to the conventional absorption tomography, but the set-up used for strain tomography quantifies lattice spacing rather than density.","4916":"Layered lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NMC811) is one of the most promising positive electrode material due to its high capacity, low cost, and low toxicity (Li T, 2020). However, the structural instability of NMC at the charge\/discharge process seriously restricts the battery performance and decreases its lifetime. To improve that, a thin protective coating by the ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) can be used on the electrode for stabilizing the NMC811 batteries at high voltage. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis will give further understanding of the local and environmental changes around the Ni, Mn, and Co of electrode materials (pristine and coated), the goal of this experiment is to perform in-situ XAS on organometallic (Ce3+) and CeO2 coated along with the pristine NMC811 electrodes in fresh and aged assembled coin cells to understand the exact role and behavior of the coating in the host NMC structure during cycling.","4917":"Layered Ni-rich lithiated metal oxides such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) are attractive candidates as next-generation Li-ion battery (LiB) positive electrode materials due to their high capacities, high working potential and reasonable price. Unfortunately, the cycle life of these materials is relatively short due to the structural instability at high delithiated states. However, the loss in performance over time can be retarded by either bulk or surface Zr-doping. The goal of this experiment is to perform operando XAS on different Zr-doped and undoped electrodes in fresh and aged assembled coin cells to understand the exact role and behaviour of the dopant in the host NMC structure during cycling.","4918":"The aim of this proposal is to synthesize, study the structures and high-pressure behavior of iron halides in diamond anvil cells at conditions close to the Earth's lower mantle and outer core by means of single crystal XRD and SMS.

However, the current technology suffer from low gold kinetics and capacities and industry searches for new kinds of adsorbents. To embrace this new challenge, metal organics frameworks (MOFs) have the potential to become great adsorbents for extracting gold from e-waste leachate, due to their porous nature and high surface areas. In an attempt to design a MOF for gold recovery from aqueous solution, a post-synthetic modification strategy was proposed to allow the introduction of different amine adsorption sites. The host material was chosen to be MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 due to the relatively high chemical stability of the MOF, high surface area and large pore windows which allow the diffusion of the amines but also gold to the bulk.","4920":"We will optimize all optics and acquisition schemes for the laser-heated DAC experiments.","4925":"Nano-imaging of biological samples","4929":"One approach to circumvent unfavorable thermodynamics of CO2-methanol synthesis compared to syngas feed is the in-situ condensation of methanol (and water) which shifts the equilibrium to the product side. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of in-situ methanol and water condensation on the catalyst structure of a Cu\/ZnO\/ZrO2 catalyst during CO2-methanol synthesis by using a novel high-pressure operando XAS reactor. Structure changes due to variation of pressure and temperature in the condensation zone will be monitored in a spatially-resolved manner in order to investigate possible deactivation mechanism like ZnO agglomeration, restructuring or loss of oxygen vacancies.

Chalcogenide glasses show numerous interesting, and often puzzling, effects when irradiated with a laser (i.e., refractive index and density variations). Although the phenomenology of these effects has been studied and discussed, their microscopic origin is still debated. The majority of the proposed models postulates that the impinging photons trigger atomic rearrangement, but there are not detailed structural studies. With the proposed experiment we aim at understanding the structural variations caused by the photons and their role on the photoinduced phenomena.","4931":"This experiment aims at elucidating the complex structure-activity-stability relationship driving the high performance of hollow iridium-copper (IrCu) aerogel catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at proton exchange water electrolyzer (PEMWE) anode.

This compound is a magnetic Weyl semimetal that combines topologically non-trivial band structures and flat-band ferromagnetism, both arising from the underlying kagome network of the Fe atoms. Our previous optical pump-probe transient reflectivity investigations suggested a unique interplay between phonons and the electronic structure in this compound. Here, we seek to understand the underlying structural changes that govern ultrafast dynamics of Fe3Sn2.","4942":"Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures capping chromosomes extremities which they prevent native chromosome ends from being recognized and processed as double-stranded break ends by DNA damage repair pathways. Paradoxically, Ku protein binds telomere DNA ends and contributes to their protection. But Ku is also an essential actor of the NHEJ double strand break repair pathway and it can facilitate NHEJ-dependent fusions between telomeres. Our aim is to unravel the molecular mechanisms played by telomere factors Rap1, Rif2 and Sir4 to protect telomeres against the action of the DNA repair factor Ku. We have obtained a first structure of scKu-DNA-scRap1 complex using a glacios of Institut Pasteur and Cryosparc reconstruction, but to improve the resolution we have prepared new grids after purification of complex on a gel filtration column and we would like use the Titan Krios of ERSF to collect a new serial images.

During sintering, the average NP size increases but strong debate exists on which mechanism causes sintering, being either (i) NP migration and coalescence or (ii) Ostwald ripening by atomic transport between immobile NPs. Herein, the aim is to extract first-of-its-kind insights on the role of NP migration during NP sintering. By applying GIXPCS-GISAXS under true working conditions of the catalyst, the NP migration rate will be monitored in conjunction to its size evolution under different reaction conditions, allowing to unravel which mechanism governs NP sintering. This approach has never been applied in NP catalysis, and will unambiguously answer long-standing, foundational questions on NP sintering.","4950":"Study of marine sponges (Demospongiae) having a mineralize skeletal elements using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging.","4952":"Uptake of Fe from metallic Fe particles composed of pure Fe 57 isotope will be determined by uXRF and uXANES.

In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, for small enough assemblies there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favourable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In the proposed experiment, we will follow the morphological evolution and branching of slender protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also demonstrate the role of spontaneous processes in biological tissue formation. We aim to provide a toolkit for controlled branching of macromolecular crystals.","4962":"In this proposal we present new hybrid crystalline materials based on a nitrogen-donor organic molecules and a biological active molecule, namely quercetin and morin. Materials were assembled with different transition metal cations depending on the final application, obtained by either microwave-assisted synthesis or under solvothermal conditions. Materials are obtained as microcrystalline powders or small-sized single crystals. For this reason, our in-house diffractometers have not been effective in the elucidation of the new crystal architectures. We believe that the high-resolution data collected at the BM01 and ID22 beamlines will allow us to unveil the crystalline structures of these materials. Because of their interesting application, the crystallographic data would help us to understand the biological activity of these bio-materials as well as the possible interactions that they create with different biological species (namely DNA and RNA).

The current consensus based on state-of-the-art synchrotron and electron microscopy data, is that the formation of crystalline phases in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical involving several steps, including an intermediate amorphous\r\nphase. The overarching issue that remains to be resolved is whether all three phases of CaSO4, and in particular gypsum and bassanite,\r\nfollow the same non-classical pathway entailing a common precursor amorphous phase? With this proposal we aim to use SAXS\/WAXS to\r\nfollow in situ and in a time-resolved manner the evolution of species forming from aqueous solutions containing calcium and sulfate ions.

Spin coherent shuttling over several microns is possible by applying time-dependent waveforms to the gates. Strain fluctuations on the 100 nm level deteriorate the uniformity of electron potential and may lead to decoherence. As shown by non-destructive nano-beam XRD measurements, a significant source of strain is the stress exerted by the gate electrodes themselves. Here, we propose to use coherent Bragg diffraction to further enhance the resolution and thus be able to investigate real shuttling devices (\u201cQuBus\u201d) with structure sizes smaller than the nano-beam. This will involve focused ion beam (FIB) preparation to provide samples of optimal size for coherent diffraction.","4970":"We aim at investigating the average and local structure of La2NiO4-xF2x intercalation cathodes for Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) as alternatives to Li batteries.   \r\nPXRD patterns will be collected in suitable x (0\u2264x\u22641.5) and T (100\u2264T\u2264600) ranges, so encompassing their operating range. \r\nThe data will be analyzed using Rietveld and PDF analysis, flanked by BVS and DFT calculations. \r\nAll expertizes (synthesis, data collecting and analysis, DFT calculations) are present in the proposing team.\r\nWe expect to map the structure of La2NiO4-xF2x samples as a function of x and T at different length scales spanning from the local order to the average structure.

For example, the position, integrated intensity and integral breadth of a diffraction peak cannot be related to the lattice spacing of the material or the number of unit cells along the diffraction vector. These predictions bear important consequences for the analysis of diffraction patterns from nanocrystals. They have not yet been confronted to experimental measurements performed on simple model systems. The aim of this proposed experiment is to investigate in detail the diffraction patterns from very clean ultrathin SOI films and confront these results to kinematic scattering calculations taking into account all nanodiffarction artefacts.","4975":"Understanding the control parameters influencing orbital order (cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions) in the solid state is crucial to optimising technologically relevant properties.

We have recently prepared ABF3 perovskites (where A = Na+, K+ and B = Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+) and propose to systematically study the low-temperature structural behaviour of key compositions to identify any orbital order (OO) driven phase transitions, bridging the gap in the literature.

Autografts are preferred but are often not possible meaning that synthetic and xenograft options must be considered. Development targets for synthetic and xenograft materials focus on increasing the speed the graft becomes incorporated with less attention to its long-term stability. Bone\u2019s stability and ability to repair itself is influenced by many variables, but a fluid filled network connecting osteocyte cells called the lacunar-canalicular network (LCN) has been shown to be critical. Here we aim to use the sub-micron tomographic imaging at ID16A to characterize the LCN network in bone regenerated by autologous vs xenografts vs synthetic approaches, correlating with histology and electron microscopy studies to test the hypothesis - LCN architecture varies between grafted bone depending on graft type and this impacts response to insult. ","4982":"Ceramic materials present an elastic-brittle behaviour at room temperature, leading to fracture before any sign of plasticity. This is linked to the low mobility of dislocations, compromising any ductility as is the case of metallic materials. Some zirconia-based ceramics can exhibit real plasticity at room temperature thanks to a martensitic phase transformation mechanism (tetragonal to monoclinic), which is similar to the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) in shape-memory alloys.\r\nWith a stress and\/or temperature-controlled phase transformation as a source of toughening, zirconia doped with cerium oxide ceramics are particularly remarkable, with a plastic deformation on the order of one percent before rupture and lower sensitivity to the presence of defects. Still, the transformation onset in not fully described. Thus, we conduct a multi-scale approach to that end, my means of Laue microdiffraction and in situ compression of ceria-doped zirconia micropillars.","4983":"Stony corals grow in seawater, where they successfully isolate Ca to precipitate CaCO3 mineral, mostly in the form of aragonite however Sr is often incorporated in small amounts in the skeleton, possibly alongside amorphous mineral. Previous low-resolution XRF mapping on mySpot with a 20 \u00b5m diameter beam did not provide sufficient information on the spatial distribution of Sr in relation to the mineral deposits. We propose to use the nm-sized beam of ID21 and to excite XRF L lines of Sr to image the distribution of Sr and within Ca in newly forming corals, grown under different Sr water concentrations. The low energy of Sr L edge excitation (ca. 1805 eV) will help us pinpoint where this element is found.

This experiment will reveal the role of various correlations in the electromechanical response, which remains unclear despite decades of studies.  We will use an electric field to bias polar displacements while cooling the samples from the disordered state while monitoring changes in macroscopic symmetry (Bragg peaks) and local correlations (diffuse scattering).

CarH is composed of a chromophore binding domain (CBD) and a DNA binding domain (DBD). In dark state, the protein forms a stable tetramer. Upon light exposure, the H132 residue of carH binds to the cobalt atom and the tetramer eventually dissociates. Little is known about the structural response of carH after light absorption and we aim at filling this gap. To this end, we already used time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS) at ID09 on the CBD of CarH from T. Thermophilus (TtCBD) (LS-2958). The TtCBD variant do not show teramer dissociation.\r\nHence, time-resolved WAXS data on the full-length TtcarH could clarify the role of the DBD and the tetramer dissociation in the protein functional dynamics. Moreover, structural model for the intermediates of the full-length carH are still missing as the protein crystal usually do not survive the teramer dissociation.","4990":"We propose to measure the acoustic velocity of Ti- and\/or Al-bearing calcium perovskite (capv), the 3rd most abundant mineral in the lower mantle. The two published studies of capv\u2019s elastic properties have a significantly different temperature dependence, and both diverge significantly from computational results. Our previous work was one of these, reporting vp and vs of capv to ~ 13 GPa & 1500 K on ID06-LVP (see ES-464 and ES-636 reports). We now propose to extend this study, to determine the thermo-elastic properties of capv at pressures extending to 30-35 GPa. Data will overlap conditions of previous work to remeasure temperature derivatives as well as clarifying the pressure dependance of capv\u2019s thermo-elastic properties for more reliable extrapolation to the deep lower mantle. This will contribute directly to the interpretation of lower mantle seismic heterogeneities, and provide a mechanism for fingerprinting recycled material throughout Earth\u2019s mantle.","4992":"Imbibition of wetting liquids into porous media is a topic of great scientific interest due to its geological, environmental, biological, and daily life importance. Recent developments in X-ray techniques enable in situ imaging imbibition in 4D (3D + time). During imbibition, many rapid events take place at the interfaces between fluids and the solid matrix. Pore filling events happen rapidly in milliseconds, posing a challenge for real-time 3D monitoring. Consequently, 3D imaging has been mostly restricted to equilibrium states before and after the process. We propose to study a) forced and b) spontaneous imbibition of wetting phase fluid into porous media using our recently proposed stroboscopic method for non-destructive real-time 3D imaging of fast pore-scale events.

Annealing will release strains induced by the protein shown to arise during sample drying. By nano XRD+XRF mapping matched with phase contrast enhanced nano-CT (holoCT) imaging, we will identify the relations between deformation fields and key structural elements: fiber bundles, interface, tubules and cementocyte canaliculi.

By monitoring the changes in the lattice spacing (XRD) and the Debye-Waller factor (XAS), thermally induced lattice expansion\/disorder will be linked to the temperature.

Although SSBs utilizing silicon anodes show broad and attractive application prospects, current results are still in an infant state in terms of electrochemical performance, characterization, and mechanistic understanding.  Hence, this study focuses on the role of Si particle size distribution in a composite anode on the electrochemical performance of SSBs, which is of high relevance for future applications in, e.g. EVs.

Recently, we developed innovative compounds that transport Cu(I) ions and we proved that they can kill cancer cells. To deepen our understanding of both Cu homeostasis in cancer cells and the mechanism of action of our compounds, we aim to study Cu subcellular distribution. To reach these objectives, we plan to perform X-ray fluorescence microscopy on healthy vs cancer cells in cryogenic conditions as well as on cancer cells exposed to a Cu-transporting compound with anticancer activity.

This family exhibits a hierarchical core\u2212shell support, wherein a carbon nitride shell stabilizes the catalyst sites in unique coordination nests. The catalyst is in form of Pt-Ni alloy clusters (size 1-5 nm), and the specific synthesis procedure ensures exceptional performances, since the strong catalyst-support interactions, likely mediated by N atoms, inhibit the leaching of metal species and particle agglomeration during operation.

The goal is to quantify the carbon integration in the crystal structure and the impact it has on local distortions of both the starting material and the hydride. In addition, we want to study the kinetics of the hydrogenation reaction. The modifications imposed by carbon significantly increase the hydrogen binding energy associated with the initial physisorption, pushing the material closer to applications.

By comparing wires with different diameters for different degrees of deformation (shear strain at the surface is equal for every wire diameter), it will be possible to quantify the  evolution of plastic deformation from the center to the surface in dependence of the wire diameter, and accordingly to quantify the impact of pure strain gradients on the observed size effects for strength and hardening behaviour for the first time.

We propose to use propagation phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography on beamline BM18 to visualise the type and only specimen of the important early species Megachirella wachtleri. Previous lab-based X-ray micro-CT yielded very incomplete and unclear visualization of its anatomy.

It is very likely that similar processes occur for many different battery materials where metastable phases relax into more stable phases as soon as the electrochemistry is paused. These relaxations could occur differently at different cycling rates, and at different state of charge.

Since the tip region exhibits the strongest dynamics and smallest length scales within a dendritic structure, its imaging is accompanied by significant noise, which prevents a straight-forward use of standard analysis methods.

At low temperatures, a dielectric dispersion resembling relaxor ferroelectrics is observed. However, second harmonic generation measurements did not show a breaking of center symmetry and synchrotron XRD did not reveal any structural change below Ts. Based on theoretical calculations on a similar system BaFe12O19 (Wang and Xiang, PRX 4, 011035 (2014)), we suggest that EuAl12O19 transfers into a frustrated antiferroelectric phase below Ts.

It goes through a NiAs-4C (hexagonal-monoclinic) structural phase transition at approximately 600 K that also corresponds to its ferrimagnetic phase transition. This structural phase transition causes the onset of ferroelastic domains or \u2018twins\u2019. In this study, we plan to confirm that ferroelastic domains are unchanged by applying a magnetic field at room temperature, that they disappear above the N\u00e9el temperature and study their dynamics as they reform, quantify the degree of magnetoelasticity and study the reorientation of the twin domains as a function of strain.","5535":"Oxygen is a unique element, with the only known molecular magnet and with very small compact valence orbitals allowing the short double chemical bond in the oxygen molecule. Remarkably, oxygen exhibits a richer phase diagram than other diatomic molecular systems. To date, the structural investigation of oxygen under pressure has been limited to 133 GPa and the structural characterization of the metallic transition about 100 GPa has been disclosed by single-crystal X-ray microdiffraction.  The structural evolution of metallic phase of solid oxygen and the possibility of inducing a molecular dissociation in the solid state remain totally unknown. With this proposal, we will explore to pressures exceeding 300 GPa, by single crystal X-ray microdiffraction, the phase stability of the metallic phase and uncover other possible phases and crystalline structures of very dense solid oxygen.

Abiotic and biotic stress, such as pathogen attacks, osmotic or oxidative stress, result in an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, which empowers an immediate signal transduction pathway. In this contest, in plants, changes in light regimes have been described to generate Ca2+ transients in the cytosol followed by a long lasting wave in the chloroplast. For phytoplanktonic cells, light play a pivotal role on their survival and for the chimeric diatoms (key component of the phytoplankton, originated by a secondary endosymbiosis, in contrast to plants) we suggest an alternative Ca2+ signaling pathways from those identified so far.

The employment of chalcogenide glasses can foster these studies since they allow one to easily tune the microscopic structure via a change either of composition or temperature. We propose to perform an x-ray photon correlation study of these glasses to evaluate the beam-induced relaxations. We aim at unveiling the influence of the amorphous structure on the dynamic modifications induced by x-rays.

On the other hand, the structure of potential benzene-derived extended materials above these P-T conditions is terra incognita. We propose to investigate by XRD the formation of C-nano-threads and possible related, partially ordered polymers at pressures up to 100 GPa.

We make the hypothesis that adsorption of Ni2+ on different Fe-oxides (or its adsorption on specific crystal faces of a given mineral) will lead to surface complexes with different structures. Because isotope fractionation is sensitive to the local chemical environment and bond distances in the formed complexes, this may affect the fractionation of Ni isotopes, which could be used as a tracer in environmental studies.

Ag2S is a non-toxic material, which makes these QD eligible for in vivo imaging and drug delivery. However, their stability in biological systems and their biocompatibility need to be assessed before any in vivo application. We are currently developing Ag2S QDs with different sizes and coatings, in order to optimize their optical properties. We propose to make use of XAFS to investigate the stability of these different formulations in cellular models, including in 3D cell cultures mimicking the liver.

The combination of X-ray Raman Scattering (XRS) and X-ray diffraction coupled with Pair Distribution Function analysis (XRD\/PDF) is particularly apt to resolve the composition of SEI samples as it gives complementary chemical and structural insight, and thus address key points such as formation mechanism, reactivity, and transport properties.","5559":"Using combined in situ XRD and XANES experiments, we aim to follow the formation of supported High Entropy Alloy (HEA) nanoparticles, which have immense potential as catalyst materials. Supported metal nanoparticles for industrial applications are largely prepared by incipient wetness impregnation.

There is - in general - very limited knowledge on alloy formation mechanisms via incipient wetness impregnation, aside from a single study on Cu-Ni alloys.

We developed transition metal loaded nanometre-sized polymeric nanoparticles loaded with Pd, Cu, or Rh-based catalysts, for specific reactions in water and bio-media. We are currently studying the structure-activity relationships both at ensemble and single molecule level, on amphiphilic polymers with variations in hydrophobic, hydrophilic and supramolecular grafts content.

This is a rather unexpected behavior for UTX (T- transition metal, X- p element) compounds. A vanishing U 5f is expected to\r\noccur at about 17 GPa. The vanishing U moment could be due either to a compensation of the orbital and spin contribution or to the occurence of a non- magnetic ground state.

The main adsorption sites for As(V) are defective sites in the Zr cluster of UiO-66. However, the more toxic and neutral As(III) cannot be effectively removed from water. Through our post-synthetic modification strategy, we have doped UiO-66 with iron, which in turn facilitates the polymerization of dopamine inside the pores. We have found that As(III) is oxidized in the iron-doped UiO-66\/polydopamine which leads to an increased selectivity for As(III). This makes this material a promising adsorbent for total As from water sources with mixed As(III) and As(V) contamination.

Furthermore, due to limited time resolution and other constraints, capturing pore formation and oil uptake has not been possible.

As shown in our previous studies of SPtSe [1], grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) is well suited to monitor in situ the formation of a Janus TMD, and to determine its atomic structure quantitatively. Here, GIXD will allow monitoring the substitution of the top Te layer of a Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) single layer by S and Se, thanks to exposure to atomic fluxes of the corresponding elements.","5579":"Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with oxidative stress.

The protein concentration will be kept low to remain below the threshold of aggregation. ","5583":"One way to enhance the characteristics of metallic alloys is to refine their microstructure. Promoting the nucleation in the undercooled zone in order to create an equiaxed growth and smaller grain can help achieving this. Some additions of hundreds of ppm of some elements in Al-based or Au-based alloys induce a huge diminution of the grainsize, but also an augmentation of twinned grain boundaries with five neighbouring grains in orientation relation. Those twinned grains could be the result of the creation of an ISRO in the liquid. The ISRO-mediated nucleation in aluminium is a theory that involves the nucleation of an ISRO phase in the liquid that promotes crystallization of alpha-aluminium phase on it. This could explain the high number of twinned grain boundaries. However, this phenomenon has never been directly observed experimentally. This experiment aims to achieve these observations by analysing the local atomic environment of selected elements in our alloys by means of EXAFS.","5588":"We are currently studying new high entropy alloys as promising solid-state stores for hydrogen. These alloys quickly absorb H at STP conditions forming hydrides and they can desorb H by heating. Despite many similarities, the H absorption capacity is fading during H absorption\/desorption cycling for some alloys whereas for others it stabilizes at the first cycle. The reason of such behaviour is not yet known. We hypothesis that this might be due to the developing of short-range ordering by sequential cycling. Moreover, laboratory X-ray diffraction before and after cycling did not allow us to conclude about a possible structural change nor phase segregation. Thus, we propose to study here the local crystal structure in various compositionally complex alloys (five HEAs) as well as its change induced during H absorption\/desorption cycling by in situ X-ray total scattering and associated PDF analysis.","5590":"We intend to study phase transitions and structural modifications taking place in single crystals of the luminescent 1-(pyren-1-yl)prop-2-yn-1-onyl)-\r\n(triethylphosphine)-gold(I) compound (chemical formula C25 H24 O P Au) at high-pressure using X-ray diffraction (HP XRD).

However they have been shown to magnetically order due to other interactions driving those systems away from the pure Kitaev case. These interactions are strongly believed to arise from the distortions of the Ir-O-Ir angles away from 90\u00b0.

Mixing cations reduces halide segregation but it remains unclear whether this is related to a relaxation of the strain. In this proposal, we will use time-resolved WAXS experiments to get insights on strain effects on phase segregation and recovery as function of cation composition. We will investigate the effect of pressure on the strain in mixed-cation perovskites, which was not reported before.

We propose to grow multilayers of the two organic molecules PTCDI-C8 (N,N\u2032-dioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide) and the N-alkane (TTC, C44H90) which are known for their high degree of structural order and layer-by-layer growth modes.","5627":"Dislocations and how they self-organize with increasing deformation into 3D structures of dislocation boundaries have, under current understanding, been labeled as a multi-scale process leading to work hardening.

Operando electrochemical QuickXAS studies enable us to identify dynamic behavior of the nature of Ir oxide species and its electronic and geometric interactions (oxidation state, local environment) on two different support materials (MSI) as a function of the applied potential (before, during and after OER). In a two-step synthetic route, Ir NPs will be prepared by a colloidal approach and then immobilized either on the carbon or TiO2 support material. From XAS data recorded at Ir LII\/LIII-edges, linear combination fit and EXAFS analysis will be carried out to understand the potential-resolved dynamic behavior of the chemical state of the Ir NPs (2-4 nm) and the nature of catalytically active oxide phase before, during and after the OER.","5630":"For predating and defence, scorpions largely rely on their sharp stingers to inject venom, subjecting these stingers to extreme mechanical loads. In contrast to other arthropods, e.g. crustaceans, who employ mineral for cuticle hardening, spiders and scorpions fabricate hard and sharp parts entirely without mineral. Alternatively, they often use locally elevated levels of metal ions such as Zn and Mn, as they are also found in scorpion stingers. A recent experiment at BM05, however, showed strong variations of metal ion type and distribution, both between species and in different locations of the stinger, suggesting substantial variation of strategies or even metal ion functionalites different from just mechanics. In this inhouse beamtime we would like to do XRF and XRD measurements on section of the chelicerae and chelae, which are other hard parts in the scorpions, to investigate if they use the same strategy in the aforementioned hard parts as they do in their stingers. ","5633":"Structural relaxation is one of the most fundamental issues in glasses yet to be fully understood. Recently, many interesting results regarding glass structural relaxation have been obtained by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements on metallic glasses (MGs). As an emerging novel class of MGs, high entropy metallic glasses (HEMGs) have been developed by compositional design with five or more elements of equimolar or near-equimolar ratios. They are named after their core feature of high configurational entropy. HEMGs provide a valuable opportunity to study the configurational entropy and associated local structural effect on structural relaxation in glasses. Here, we propose to study the correlation between high-entropy effect and structure relaxation in HEMGs in comparison with conventional MGs by XPCS (this proposal) at ID10 and high-energy diffraction (another proposal) to deepen our understanding of the high-entropy effect and its impact on glass relaxation.","5634":"This project aims to study the structure-dynamic relationship of one plant hemoglobin (phytoglobin) (BvPgb1.2) and one mutated version of the same denoted Cys86Ala. The goal is to expand the knowledge of important interactions for dimer formation in the wild-type (WT) protein, and compare it with the mutant, to obtain valuable information on the impact of this selected mutation. This will be studied by using different protein concentrations and buffer solution conditions, and the interactions between the subunits will be examined in detail. The results obtained in this project will be used to develop detailed models regarding the effect of this amino acid substitution on the dynamic properties within the protein to be solved by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

This proposal seeks to implement microscale 3D-XRDCT to map cracking and quantify strains fields in Li-ion and Na-ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs) with high capacity alloy anodes such as Sn. Through this work,  we will examine bulk and nanoporous-Sb particles in full capillary cells while being lithiated (and sodiated) in operando, to investigate the role that architecture plays in mechanically stabilizing high volume changes in alloy anodes to improve electrical conductivity and cycling performance. By comparing the bulk and nanoporous alloys, we aim to elucidate the role of structural stabilizers such as the NP-SbSn in preventing mechanical failure of the anode, and tie it to behaviour (capacity retention) at the cellular scale.","5637":"The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the structural evolution of Gd2(Ti1-xZrx)2O7 nanoparticles synthesized by a sol-gel approach upon increasing annealing temperature (T). The transition from initial amorphous precursors to nanocrystalline materials with a pyrochlore\/fluorite structure that occurs during the annealing procedure can be regarded as the inverse path of the irradiation-induced disordering\/amorphization of the crystalline compounds. The proposed experiment will help to elucidate the disordering process that might affect these potential nuclear waste storage materials without using radioactive elements or irradiation sources.\r\nThe study will be a multiscale investigation of both the local- and long-range structure and will be carried out by means of High-Resolution X-ray Powder Diffraction (HR-XRPD).

However, milling is also able to induce transformations towards metastable polymorphic forms, which has generally a strong repercussions on the bioavailability of drugs, i.e. on their efficiency. The aim of this project is to determine the mechanisms driving these transformations which are still unknown. This should greatly improve the control of the physical state of the drugs during pharmaceutical processes and thus their therapeutic performances. For this, we will take advantage of the high-time, high-angular and spatial resolution of synchrotron beam to study in situ, and thus in real time, the kinetics of the polymorphic transformation of Sulfamerazine, a widely used sulfonamide antibacterial drug, upon milling. ","5639":"Silk ribbons spun by recluse (or brown) spiders (Loxosceles), orb-weaving spiders  and silkworm fibers are all semicrystalline beta-sheet materials. Loxosceles silk differs, however,  from these silks in its proposed hierarchical structural organization, although mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength) are comparable. Indeed, spiders and silkworm fibers  crystallinet nanodomains  assemble with disordered protein spacers into cylindrical nanofibrils of 5-6 nm diameter, forming nanofibrillar bundles. Loxosceles ribbons show, however, anisotropic nanofibrils of 5-9 nm thickness and 20 nm width, forming a lauered structure. The ribbonsd tensile properties correspond to the average of tensile properties of the nanofibrils while  modelling of spider silk suggests mesoscale chain confinement for optimized mechanical properties. Here, we here propose a systematic study of the hierarchical structural organization for single Loxosceles ribbons by scanning nanobeam SAXS\/WAXS.","5649":"Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate thin films several questions have arisen about the role of the SrTiO3(STO)-capping-layer in the stabilization of the infinite-layer phase.

Here, we will use high energy x-ray scattering in transmission geometry to collect diffuse scattering volumes in-situ during AC electrical poling treatments and subsequent electric field cycling.  Such data will provide critical microstructural mechanism information to understand the underlying cause of these enhancements as well as guide future composition and post-growth processing treatments.","5659":"The direct conversion of CO2 with hydrogen to methanol under mild conditions is a much-coveted reaction to address the crisis of climate and energy crises.\r\n Copper is a selective catalyst it only operates at relatively high pressures and temperatures, it also has an optimum particle size, not easily maintained over repeated cycles. Zn-promoted Pd is regarded as a potential contender at milder conditions. In addition, smaller particles can be used yielding greater atom economy may be achieved. Metal-organic frameworks are ideal substrates for nanoconfining catalyst nanoclusters, which is the approach we have taken.\r\n However to understand where the catalyst activity arises from a deep understanding into the electronic characteristics of the catalyst, particularly in operando conditions must be developed.

We will take advantage of 3D printing technologies to overcome previous limitations in difference X-ray scattering studies when mixing samples. A recent proof-of-principle test at ID02 of the ESRF successfully observed structural changes in KcsA by using UV light to release caged protons, thereby jumping the sample from pH 7 (neutral) to 4 (acidic). We will extend this study using a mixing cell to induce a similar pH jump. Should both approaches yield similar structural changes, the same approach will probe ligand-binding-induced conformational changes in a ligand gated ion channel (LGC-39) isolated from the model-organism C. elegans, and ligand-binding-induced conformational changes in cytochrome P450, a drug metabolizing enzyme. This work increases our understanding of neuronal transmission selectivity and enzyme activity.","5663":"The molecular properties of water serves an important role in both chemistry and biology, as individual water molecules can take the role of active participants in solution-phase reactions. Though water solvation has been studied extensively, a good description of the micro-structure of the solvation shells surrounding water solvated complexes remains elusive. In this experiment, we aim to study water solvation by determining the structure of the photoaquated species which forms following light-induced ligand-dissociation of [Fe(CN)6]4- in aqueous solution. Further, we will further investigate the structural changes of the solvation cage following photo-abstraction of an electron by photo-exciting at a slightly shorter wavelength.

We hypothesize that the orientation of the nanostructure reflects the spiral macrostructure, defining its mechanical properties. Previous experiments have shown microstructure with a high anisotropy in the tusk direction with helical deviations from the tusk axis, however, the small sample size restricted the ability to connect the macrostructure to the local features investigated. How the organization of the nanostructure connects to these macroscopic features can only be done by probing the nanostructure through scattering in macroscopic samples. Therefore, we propose to use small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography with a high-energy beam to study the 3D arrangement of the mineralised collagen fibres in the tusk at the macroscopic scale. That will be of high importance for understanding the structure of the tusk and its connection to tusk mechanics.","5671":"In the panorama of H2 production strategies we are currently exploring the water gas shift (WGS) reaction over metal single sites supported on cerium-based UiO-66(Ce). We have recently prepared a Ce3+ rich UiO-66(Ce) catalyst with anchored Pt single sites. The catalyst presented similar catalytic activity than the conventional Pt\/CeO2 catalyst at lower temperature (150 vs 50\u00b0C). Operando FT-IR and ex-situ Ce L3-edge XAS spectra unveiled a relation between the higher activity and hydrides\/formate formation parallel to a higher Ce3+ content.

In particular, mining wastes from phosphate extraction have shown great potential for the extraction of metals including critical metals, such as Magnesium (Mg) and Rare Earth Elements (REEs) that are the heart of a number of strategic technologies for the environmental transition.

Reaction conditions, post-synthetic treatments and the nature of the starting material are some of the most important parameters guiding the selective formation of a given phase. We recently investigated by in situ XRD the crystallization of nanostructured amorphous boron. We observed the appearance of an unidentified boron compound at high pressure (5 GPa), which is unstable upon decompression. However, the former experiment was performed by using polychromatic light at PSICHE beamline at SOLEIL. With the present experiment, we aim at an in-depth characterization of the named compound from a structural point of view, by analysing the crystallization pathways.

An implant\u2019s success rate is determined by the bone quality around the implant. While dentists possess tools to quantify the amount of bone, they lack precise knowledge about how drilling and loading influence the bone ultrastructure in the peri-implant zone. This proposal will characterize interfacial bone of clinical-sized Ti implants subjected to real-life loading conditions with multimodal high-spatial resolution scanning S\/WAXS, XRF. By connecting ultrastructural findings with clinical parameters, we will bridge the gap between implant stability and underlying bone quality. Due to a statistically relevant set of sample conditions, we will be able to provide scientific-based guidelines on how drilling and loading protocols favour a rapid, strong, and long-lasting osseointegration.","5687":"Biomedical scaffolding has been around for decades, however, the main criticism from medical aspects in applied (soft) tissue engineering comes down to the fact that artificial structures cannot carry sufficient hierarchical complexity that is comparable to the real biological bony or soft cartilage material. These prooves to be limitting in currently available technologies. In this work, a novel material produced by electrospinning micro-fibrils at different extrusion rates has proven to provide a sufficiently superior hierarchical structure. Before proceeding towards the mineralisation studies, the main steps lie in the full field mechanical characterisation of these structures, in situ. Consequently, two beamlines (ID16b and ID19) join their capacities.

Combined in situ XAS\/XRD experiments under reactant atmospheres will help establishing the fundamental stability region and surface properties of Mo and W-based i-MXenes. This knowledge will guide the pretreatment conditions of these materials, and their rational application in catalytic reactions with oxygenated species.

Our \u03bc-XRD mapping on (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 thin films after an electric field-driven insulator to metal transition indeed revealed a compressive lattice response. As electric field and light pulses are both prone to generate hot carriers, we might expect that photoexcitation would also induce a compressive lattice response in (V1-xCrx)2O3. However our recent time-resolved XRD study of (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 films at ID09 revealed a tensile rather than compressive effect. To clarify the situation, we propose to work in parts of the temperature-x phase diagram more prone to reveal this sought photoinduced compressive effect. Overall this study might challenge the paradigm by which photoexcitation of matter always leads to a thermally-driven expansion, and suggest that Mott physics can lead to a reverse compressive behavior.

The drawback of this process is the creation of strain (compressive or tensile) in the perovskite structure due to the mismatch between the expansion coefficient of the perovskite and substrate. The strain impacts several properties which are related to performance and stability. Here, we propose to evaluate the strain nature (compressive or tensile) in perovskite solar cells under operando conditions (temperature, light, and bias) by full-field diffraction X-ray microscopy.

The main objectives of this proposal are a synthesis of new Ln-C compounds at multimegabar pressure, characterization of their crystal chemistry and compressional behaviour, tests of theoretical predictions, and search for regularities in lanthanides carbides chemistry.\r\n","5732":"The black coral antipatharians Stichopathes sp. live in a range of habitats of extreme depths in different seas worldwide. They form coiled wires, that are poorly mineralized yet they posses a hard and extremely damage resilient chitin-based skeleton that is largely unexplored. The coral exhibits extraordinary  toughness making it very difficult to break, presumably needed for life in the harsh habitat. We propose to study the relation between chitin fibers, cavities and internal architecture and forces needed to deform and fracture the coral, measured by in-situ 3 point bending on ID19, to be able to image the tension and compression sides of specimens exposed to increasing loads. With energies above 75 keV we will avoid radiation damage and directly visualize internal damage arresting structures at micrometer resolution. This will shed light on damage resistant mechanisms that evolved under environmental conditions that are very different than those found on land.","5735":"Previously, we performed XAS studies to try to confirm the oxidation of Co centers and Co-O\/-N\/-C coordination. Due to the low resolution of those XAS experiments to distinguish O\/N\/C species with similar Z-number, we were not able to resolve the real active local-structure driving OER in CoNCN\/CNTs. In this proposal, we aim to perform operando Vtc-XES and HERFD-XANES experiments to monitor the local-structure reconstruction processes in metal carbodiimides on carbon nanotubes (MNCN\/CNT, M=Co\/Fe\/Ni) and unravel the effective coordination of metal centers for improved electrocatalysis. The Vtc-XES sensitivity to identify light C\/N\/O atoms in complex metallic matrixes, will allow us to determine the energy shifts in the ligand 2s ionization energies of bound C\/N\/O species upon catalytic activation. This will offer in-depth understandings on the structure-function relationships between coordinating O\/N\/C atoms and metal centers for designing high-performance MNCN-based electrocatalysts.","5736":"Zirconium based metal-organic frameworks featuring the highly stable hexanuclear zirconium-oxo cluster have gained increasing interest for various applications in water decontamination. The Zr cluster offers strong binding sites for various pollutants including As(V) and organic contaminants such as organophosphate pesticides. Here, we propose an alternative approach to form amorphous metal-organic structures featuring high porosity and high density of Zr6 clusters. The formed Zr clusters and their spatial arrangement in the polymer matrix are studied using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and pair distribution function analysis.","5737":"High energy density and improved safety combined with long cycle life are crucial goals for the development of the more environmentally being next generation lithium batteries (LIBs).  Layered lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides  (NMC811) are one of the most promising positive electrode materials due to their high capacity and low cost. However, the structural instability of NMC811 seriously restricts the battery performance and decreases lifetime.  To improve NMC811 performance, a thin protective coating can be used on the electrode for stabilizing NMC811 at high voltages. We have synthesized a novel coating on the surface of a NMC811 electrode  which enhances the structural and chemical stability even at high working potentials, and consequently protect the cathode capacity. Synchrotron X-ray tomography will be in a key role to investigate the role of the coating against the parasitic reactions,  and crack formation, for developing NMC811 enhancement.","5739":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate the crystal structure of Eu2Pd3Sn at the long and local scale by means of X-ray powder diffraction and pair distribution function analyses, from room temperature down to 10 K.

In Roscoff the projects concern marine glycobiology and marine phage proteins, deciphering functions of 'unknown' proteins and PUL assemblages. The projects treated in Orl\u00e9ans are DNA structure and repair, transcription regulation, molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress; in Nancy the studies concern the regulation and mechanisms of prokaryotic polyketide syntheses.

Nanostructured Ir-Ru catalysts, containing less than 30 % of expensive Ir, are the possible industrially applicable solution to the problem. The effect of enhanced stability of inexpensive Ru by a small amount of Ir is known, yet still not comprehensively explained. The aim of this high-energy X-ray scattering experiment is to elucidate the complex concentration-dependent interplay between Ir and Ru, which affects the alloy\u00b4s structure, strain and chemical state and is most likely responsible for its high performance.

The systems under study are soft colloids that closely resemble resins used in real everyday applications and show different drying mechanisms. The latexes entail different chemistry and structural properties (defined by the particle composition, the glass transition temperature of the polymer, and the crystallinity of the phases) and hence exhibit different film formation mechanisms.","5745":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","5746":"We propose to study nano-scale density inhomogeneities in metallic glasses (MGs) and how they relate to the stability and mechanical properties of the glasses, using nano-tomography at ID16A. Recent studies have shown that density inhomogeneities on the length scale of 200nm and above, and up to 20% in magnitude, can exist in melt-quenched MGs. However, it is unknown how these density inhomogeneities relate to the preparation method and thermal history of the MGs. Phase-contrast X-ray tomography at ID16A is well suited to answer this question thanks to its capability to detect low-level electron density fluctuations. The results are relevant to both the physical nature of the glass transition and industrial applications based on the mechanical properties of MGs.","5747":"In this experiment we are planning to exploit high resolution ptychography and X-ray fluorescence to understand the origins of the symmetry breaking in biomineralized tissues","5748":"Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease affecting about 10% of women of reproductive age, which is still poorly understood.

(La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-d (LSCF) and (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-d (BSCF) systems are considered as state-of-the-art materials for solid oxide cells working at intermediate temperature (IT-SOCs); however, due to problems related to Co toxicity and its supplying, the search for alternative Co-free perovskites is crucial. Recently we undertook a study on the BSCuF system, both in the form of nanofibers and micrometric powders, respectively obtained through electrospinning and sol-gel processes. We propose to collect total scattering data on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\u2013\u03b4, as reference material, and on five different samples of the BSCuF system, both as powders and nanofibers, with the final aim to gain a deeper understanding of the structure at the local scale and correlate it with the electrochemical behaviour of the  corresponding cathodes.\r\n","5751":"The versatility of the well-known ABX3 perovskites to host almost all the elements of the periodic table leads to the formation of the so-called double perovskites or elpasolites, with A2B\u2019B\u2019\u2019O6 stoichiometry. The literature contains very few studies on this kind of compounds under high pressure (HP). Nevertheless, from them several trendlines depending on the oxidation state of A cation can be discerned. A high stability on these compounds are exhibited when the A cation is trivalent. When it comes to a divalent A cation, the AO12 polyhedral unit is more compressible than those octahedron of B\u2019 and B\u2019\u2019 cations, triggering the increase of the distortion of the latter units with compression. This feature would lead to the observation of a high-spin to low-spin (HS-LS) transition in the Fe cation in Sr2FeIrO6 and Ba2FeIrO6 in the Mbar regime, similar to what happens in many other Fe compounds like in Fe2O3 polymorphs or the B1 phase of (Mg1-xFex)O.","5752":"In the Orne River, industrial residues were dumped during decades, stored under river waters. With the dam opening, the contaminated banks suffer oxidation, sunlight. The modification of hydrology also enhanced the erosion of bottom parts of the river banks (increase of water velocity), and increased the amplitude of water table oscillations. Using XAS experiments at Fe and Zn edge, we aim at following the mineralogical evolution of these ancient industrial deposits in order to assess the mobility of contaminants such as Zn.","5753":"The origins of terrestrial sensory capabilities in vertebrates are a source of major unanswered questions in evolutionary biology. This gap in understanding can be addressed by investigating the neural anatomy of early members of Amniota, the group of four-legged vertebrates that conquered land. Here we propose to scan the skulls of four extinct early amniote species (comprising 9 specimens) from the Permian of South Africa. With these scans we will be able to reconstruct their brain endocasts, cranial nerves, and inner ear, enabling an evolutionary understanding of the sensory capabilities in these important fossil species.","5754":"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) crucially worse the prognosis of cancer patients, and no treatments are so far available. The treatment of several tumors becomes problematic or prohibitive in patients with severe CIPN, crucially worsening the prognosis. In murine models of CIPN, the Caudal and the Sciatic nerves (CN, SN) has been identified as two fundamental characters of the etiology.  Here, we postulated that early angiogenetic mechanisms start in the peripheral nervous compartments (the dorsal root ganglion, DRG, the sciatic and caudal nerves, SN, CN) mainly affected by the chemotherapy neurotoxicity. However, subcellular structures of DRG, SN and CN are inaccessible by micrometer resolution imaging techniques and, thus, require a more detailed\r\nsetups.

Interestingly, Bi doping increases the initial capacity even further. Previously, we have performed an ex situ study on Bi-doped and neat orthorhombic Nb2O5 at selected potentials of the 1st and 2nd cycle, and the results show that the storage mechanism is very complex. Since ex situ samples are single data points, the operando measurements are highly complementary. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: (i) Are the ex situ results confirmed by the operando results? (ii) How do the species change in-between the ex situ data points and (iii) what is the exact role of Bi? In addition to the 1st cycle, we will also perform an operando analysis of the 200th cycle. The results will (iv) shed light on the fading mechanisms and are, thus, essential for the further improvement of such materials.","5760":"The aim of this proposal is to obtain a ternary hydride by mixing two metals that are known to form binary superhydrides. In hydrogen at Mbar pressures, Y and Fe form binary superhydrides, respectively: YH6 with a cage-like H sublattice [5], and FeH5 with atomic H layers [6]. We will thus search for a ternary superhydride in the Y-Fe-H system. This is a continuation of the proposal HC-5070 in which a remarkable uptake of hydrogen under pressure by YFe2 up to YFe2H7 has been characterized. Hints for a transition to a YxFeyHz compound have been observed above 60 GPa. The beamtime will be devoted to solving the structure of YxFeyHz by single-crystal XRD and to measuring its equation of state and metastability range by decreasing pressure to ambient condition. Other compounds will be searched by exploring the 60-160 GPa range. Ab-initio calculations will then be performed to determine the structure of the H sublattice.","5761":"Rapid relaxation following active contraction is essential to the efficient performance of both skeletal and cardiac muscle, but its mechanistic basis is poorly understood. The well-known decrease in intracellular calcium concentration is necessary but not sufficient for rapid relaxation, and there is likely to be an additional mechanical trigger.

We have demonstrated a remediation whereby magnetic nanoparticles are functionalized to capture a contaminant, soaked into the wood, then pulled out using magnetic fields.  No information is known about where the nanoparticles penetrate into the wood, what features constitute barriers to their incursion, how effective they are at removing contaminants, and whether they are all removed during the harvesting process.

Lanthanide orthophosphate ceramics have been shown to be excellent candidates for the incorporation of trivalent dopants such as Cm3+, Am3+, and Pu3+. It is further known, that monazites can accommodate tetravalent actinides. Their incorporation requires coupled substitution reactions, which preserve charge neutrality within the phosphate ceramic structure, such as An4+ + M2+ = 2 Ln3+. This can be achieved via varius synthesis routes. For U4+ and Th4+, several records of successful substitution exist. In contrast, for Ce4+ acting as an analogue for Pu4+ it has been argued that incorporation is extremely limited due to a change in the oxidation state. In the present study we aim at understanding such redox phenomena in Ce-doped phosphate phases at elevated temperatures.

This proposal aims at studying, operando, a surface confined cobalt-based molecular catalyst for aqueous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. We will disclose the evolution of the molecular structure of the catalyst (geometry, nature of the ligands) as a function of the applied potential, in the presence or absence of the substrate. This will allow to precisely access to the real structure of the electroactive species and to apprehend potential degradation pathways.","5767":"We aim to generate a baseline fundamental description of high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants, with a particular emphasis on particle shape and porosity evolution during sintering and recrystallization.

Cerium displays mineral-melt partitionning into zircon even though the access of reduced Iron in magmetic systems should forbid the Cerium oxydation, at the core of its mineral-melt partitionning. One hypothesis developed in the litterature is the presence of a charge-transfer reaction between Cerium and Iron occuring during quench. Even though similar charge transfers have been observed between different elements, the charge transfer between Cerium and Iron is only suspected. We will investigate in situ the redox state of both Cerium and Iron at high temperature in silicate melts using Cerium L3-edge XANES spectroscopy and Iron K-edge XANES spectroscopy.

Ptychography can be extended to 3D imaging in two ways: multi-slice ptychography or ptychographic tomography. Ptychographic tomography relies on 2D ptychography to supply projections to conventional tomographic algorithms, whilst multi-slice ptychography uses the redundancy in ptychographic data to split the reconstruction into a series of axial slices. Whilst multi-slice ptychography can handle thick specimens and has a much smaller data requirement than ptychographic tomography, its depth resolution is relatively poor.

However, a full understanding and controlling of NTE mechanisms are still challenging since this behavior can be driven by different mechanisms, such as low-wavenumber phonons, spontaneous polarization, or charge transfer phenomena. Therefore, this study envisages the use of the XAS beamlines BM23\/ID24-DCM station to shed light on the NTE at local level of Zn2GeO4 nanocrystals, being complemented by high-resolution X-ray diffraction data from HR-XRD beamline ID22.

In contrast, ab initio calculations indicate that hydrostatic pressure (HP) improves the nesting conditions and therefore favours the CDW formation. HP electrical resistivity experiments showed that the CDW onset increases under HP, while parallely the FM transition temperature decreases, and suggested the presence of a hidden FM quantum critical point.

As evidenced by in-house X-ray diffraction and advanced synchrotron Laue microscopy, the samples feature high single crystallinity with a ~0.1\u00b0 misorientation among domains of a size ~30 um. Without post-synthesis treatment, high-rate growth at room temperature in genera is anticipated to introduce strain buildup in the grown crystals, e.g., among the domain walls. After consultation with the beamline science team, we determined that ex-situ annealing & measurements under an inert gas is possible.

The USAXS beamline at ESRF is uniquely poised to investigate this system due to the required q-range of 0.001 nm-1 to 1 nm-1 along with a time resolution of several milliseconds. Understanding the time-resolved structure is critical for chemical formulation strategies to control rheological properties of low-CO2 geopolymer cement binders.

Cu has been shown to be the only metal that can catalyse the transfer of more than two electrons during CO2RR, thus, generating more valuable C2+ molecules. Nanoporous Cu made by dealloying brass usually have high surface distortion, which manifests as microstrain. Our recent study shows that such microstrain acts to enhance the catalytic properties of Cu for CO2RR. However, due to the high surface mobility of Cu atoms, and the extremely harsh cathodic condition of CO2RR, preserving such high microstrain still remians challenging. The use of synchrotron-based diffraction method will enable the detailed observation of how dealloying-induced Cu lattice strain evolves during the CO2RR condition and other electrochemical dealloying condition, which can help us outline new strategies for CO2RR catalyst design, and also to uncover more aspects of dealloying of brass.\r\n","5998":"We propose a novel approach to the compositional optimization of complex two- and multi-component materials.

SAXS experiments will be conducted under different conditions for both the wild type and the pathogenic mutant, including temperature, ionic strength, and concentration of paroxetine, an  antidepressant drug. The collected SAXS data will be analyzed with the variational Bayesian method (VBWSAS) aimed to re-weight the ensemble of conformers derived from enhanced sampling atomistic simulations.

The existence and the nature of these phase transitions has not been reported in literature of LLZO so far (hardy to observe with powder data) and we propose to investigate it in detail using single-crystalline material in an in-situ high-temperature synchrotron-diffraction study. Pure LLZO is tetragonal and transforms to the Ia-3d structure at Tc ~ 645\u00b0C, in aged material a more complex transformation series is reported, which also needs a more detailed study to explain its nature.

Thick filament regulation is based on a still undefined mechanosensor that adapts to the load of the contraction the number of motors switched ON from the resting (OFF) state, in which they lie on the thick filament. In the heartbeat the internal [Ca2+] transient may not attain saturation and Ca2+-sensitivity of the filament is a relevant parameter under the control of several modulatory mechanisms, like the length dependent activation and the degree of phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins.  Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. Using X-ray diffraction on intact heart trabeculae we define the role of the sarcomeric proteins in the interfilament communication and in the mechanosensing that controls the switching ON of the myosin motors.","6165":"COVID-19 affects multiple vital organs and leads to drastic changes in tissue architecture not only in the lung but also in the heart.

On the other hand, a family of vapor-deposited MGs have been found to exhibit a greater stability and an enhanced mechanical uniformity, but it remains to be seen how their structure differs on the nanoscale. In particular, it is unknown whether density inhomogeneities exist in these ultra-stable MGs, and if so, what is the level and length scale.

We hypothesize that the site occupation of Nd is indicative of its geochemical enrichment processes. If enrichment occured via diffusion-substitution in the apatite nanopores, then the REE should occupy the Ca2 site. If the enrichment results from precipitation of authigenic apatite, then the REE is expected to occupy the Ca1 and Ca2 sites.

We plan to detect the oxidation states of Ni and Fe, and possible variations thereof during the course of the reaction. This mechanistic data will be a key information for the development of tailored materials for the industrial production of green hydrogen.","6371":"Laboratory measurement of the elastic wave velocities of major minerals relevant to planet\u2019s mantle are crucial to constrain the composition, mineralogy and temperature of the otherwise inaccessible deep interior of Earth. Ringwoodite is the most abundant phase in the lower half of the Earth\u2019s transition zone (TZ). However, almost all existing measurements of its elastic properties are restricted to pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions significantly below those of the mantle geotherm, with many made outside ringwoodite\u2019s stability field. We propose to experimentally measure the acoustic velocities of ringwoodite with compositions between (Mg0.9Fe0.1)2SiO4 and (Mg0.5Fe0.5)2SiO4 at relevant mantle PT conditions using ultrasonic interferometry in the multi-anvil press. When combined with synchrotron X-ray source, it\u2019s possible to accurately determine the pressure, density and length of the sample, therefore allow precise sound wave velocities to be obtained.","6373":"Set up nanofocus station and check bliss upgrades","6374":"Investigation of the effects of Xe implantation at different energies and depths on single crystal yttria-stabilised-zirconia.","6375":"Silk threads spun by bagworms (Psychidae) show superb mechanical properties, resulting from a highly ordered fibrillar organization. In order to clarify the structural localization in a single thread, we performed nanoscale SAXS\/WAXS at the ID13 beamline during SC5011. For an about 5um thick fiber we resolved its ca. 200 nm thick sericin layer and the nanofibrillar organization of its core. We showed that much weaker scattering from mesoscale nanofibrillar self-assembly is only revealed in cross-sections lacking sericin background scattering. In this continuation proposal, we aim clarifying further details of the mesoscale nanofibrillar organization, such as structural localization both along the radial and longitudinal directions, lattice-features of nanofibrillar packing and the effect of degumming treatment on it. For achieving these purposes, we will prepare thin sections of various thickness and analyse them by scanning SAXS\/WAXD with focus of at least 200 nm (hopefully 50 nm).","6376":"The main aim of this proposal is to study how the osteblasic differentiation stimuli affect the maturation process of mineral depositions released by\r\n osteosarcoma SaOS2 cells at 4 and 10 days after the osteoblastic induction. To this purpose we will use \u00b5XANES at the Ca K-edges to obtain the chemical\r\n speciation of mineral depositions since Ca is one the constitutive and pivotal element of hexagonal hydroxyapatite crystal present in bone. This study will\r\n contribute to unveil the genesis of bone mineralization process in osteosarcoma which is still far from to be elucidated. Moreover, this research is a part of a larger\r\n project aimed to validate a new anticancer strategy, based on the differentiation of osteosarcoma cells towards a less aggressive phenotype.

From a structural point of view, hollandites belong to the tunnel oxides and are characterized by channels partially occupied by large di- or mono-valent cations (Ba, Pb, K, Na) delimited by 2\u00d72 octahedral walls. \r\nA lowering of symmetry is often observed, possibly related to framework distortions or ordering of cations and vacancies within the tunnels.\r\nOur aim is to investigate the local environment of tunnel cations in hollandite and assess the relationship between the disorder in their position and the nature and oxidation state of octahedral cations. \r\n","6383":"The metal-insulator transition (MIT) of Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has attracted great attention due to its wide potential applications, e.g., smart windows, memory devices, and optical switching devices, based on a relatively low critical temperature and large changes in resistivity. One key parameter for the device performance is the strain-involved structural evolution during phase transition, which is still lacking. In our previous microbeam X-ray diffraction study, we confirmed the coexistence of the M1 and M2 phases caused by tensile strain. Here, we propose an in-situ temperature-dependent diffraction imaging of VO2 microcrystals to investigate the MIT and its intermediate phases to improve our knowledge of the MIT for development of high performance nano-devices with specific functionalities by controlling the morphology of twin VO2 nanocrystals.","6389":"Understanding structural changes in materials possessing a magneto-structural phase transition is crucial to perceive the energy landscape during this phase transition. On a macroscopic scale, using simultaneous measurements of the electronic, magnetic and structural subsystem, we found a decoupling of the magnetic and structural subsystem during the change from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase in FeRh. Besides the two-step transition, strain measurements indicate the presence of an intermediate tetragonal distortion of the sample. Thus, we intend to perform high-resolution XRD measurements along the temperature-induced phase transition to observe whether the Bragg peaks split (confirming the tetragonal distortion of the lattice) or not (changes in the microstructure caused by tetragonal distortions). These results will help identify the lattice transformation pathway during the first-order phase transition and identify the driving force of the phase transition.","6390":"Subduction zones tectonically link Earth\u2019s oxidized surface with its reduced deep interior. Recent studies propose that fluids driven from the subducting plate contain either reduced or oxidized S species. These fluids rise through the overlying mantle to generate arc magmas; however, it is unclear how these fluids influence arc magma redox. We propose to use S and Fe XANES analysis of apatite and Fe-silicate minerals, respectively, in exhumed subduction zone rocks. These rocks underwent intense fluid-rock interaction at depths of >80 km. The S and Fe speciation in the minerals record the redox characteristics of the fluids: If these fluids contain oxidized S, the S and Fe in the rock will be oxidized as the fluid:rock ratio increases. From these data we can identify the S species carried in the fluids. Our results will be of major interest to the Earth Science community and have profound implications for the cycling of volatiles and their impact on Earth\u2019s climate and atmosphere.","6392":"We propose XPCS measurements (transmission geometry) of the atomic diffusion and gas coalescence of H\/He implantation in Si to gain insights into the kinetics of the first step of the SmartCutTM process.

Two types of samples will be measured: single implanted wafers and implanted wafer bonded on SiO2\/Si to understand the role of a stressor on the bubble and crack formation.","6393":"The permeability of many rocks and ores is low but can increase dramatically during fluid-rock interaction via formation of connected porosity induced by mineral\r\nreplacement reactions. Such reaction-induced porosity contributes to metasomatism, metal transport and ore deposition, as well as in situ metal recovery from\r\norebodies. Our recent work has demonstrated that reaction-induced porosity is sensitive to reaction parameters such as pore pressure and temperature, but the\r\ndynamics of reaction-induced porosity remains poorly understood. We plan to perform in situ X-ray \u03bcCT experiment (up to 190 \u00b0C, 20 MPa) to investigate the\r\neffect of pore fluid pressure, confining pressure, and temperature on the dynamics of reaction-induced porosity during the replacement of calcite by magnesite,\r\nbrucite, gypsum, and anhydrite.

Plant breeding to produce low Cd-accumulating cocoa cultivars is one of them. However, this strategy requires a much better understanding and control of the physiological pathways of Cd uptake, translocation and accumulation in the beans. The various plant parts (root, branch, leaves and bean) of a cacao tree were sampled in the field and investigated in a combined approach (elemental analyses, Cd stable isotope analyses, bulk XANES spectroscopy and LA ICP MS imaging). We identified the branches and the leaves as the major storage compartments for Cd. To test their role as a sink, but also as a source of Cd for the bean, we wish to determine the Cd distribution and speciation in these tissues using \u00b5XRF and \u00b5XANES. ","6395":"The enthesis is the biological site where tendon attaches to bone. It is thus of great importance for biomechanical load transfer and achieves the task of interfacing bone and tendon through a highly optimized nanostructure and mineralization strategy. The nanostructure is actively formed in response to the prevailing load conditions. A chronic change of the enthesis\u2019 load conditionsleads to structural remodeling which alters the mechanical properties. Understanding these structural changes and coupling them to the mechanical properties is essential to optimize prophylactic and rehabilitative medical procedures.\r\nThis experiment aims at characterizing the nanostructure and mineralization of the enthesis by scanning SAXS\/WAXS and XRF. By studying the Achilles tendon enthesis (ATE) of freely-moving mice and hindlimb-unloaded mice, this experiment addresses the question how mechanical unloading impacts the enthesis nanostructure.\r\n","6397":"The aim of this proposal is to explore a potentially ubiquitous growth mechanism in colloidal nanoplatelets (NPL). Such nanoparticles are characterised by an atomically-defined thickness and display outstanding physical properties. Different growth mechanisms have been proposed to explain their controlled thickness, but they are still debated and no universal mechanism has been reported so far. Using time-resolved SAXS\/WAXS for In2S3 NPL, we have identified an unreported growth mechanism based on a nucleation-induced lamellar self-assembly process. Our preliminary experiments on CeF3 and CdSe wurtzite NPL suggest a similar mechanism, hinting for a universal mechanism and begging further investigation. We propose to confirm these findings by broadening the range of experimental conditions on the anisotropic growth of different material to explore in detail their growth mechanism. This will advance our understanding of nanoparticle synthesis in general by setting up design rules. ","6398":"Solid assemblies of organic compounds often include some inevitable misfit between constituents, giving rise to geometric frustration. In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, for small enough assemblies there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favourable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In the proposed experiment, we will follow the morphological evolution and branching of slender protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also demonstrate the role of spontaneous processes in biological tissue formation. We aim to provide a toolkit for controlled branching of macromolecular crystals.

This experiment aims to study ceramic fragments by acquiring X-ray tomographic and diffractometric data in synchronous to visualize the presence of phases associated with specific domains of the ceramic body. These data will be useful to reconstruct homogeneity and inhomogeneity formed during the firing process and to visualize the neoformation phases related to the circulation of fluids within the sample. Coupling the tomographic technique on the same fragments, we will be able to evaluate fractures, pores and voids to determine the state of preservation, isorientation of the crystalline phases and the mutual relationship between amorphous and crystalline components. The analyses will be carried out on ceramic fragments from archaeological sites in Italy, providing new analytical protocols for the study and conservation of the archaeological finds.","6400":"We will exploit the new High Power Laser Facility (HPLF) at ID-24 to determine the chemical reactivity of iron with hydrogen and\/or carbon at extreme pressure and temperature conditions on nanosecond timescale.

The element-specific XANES probe will then record how the iron nanoparticles react with either (presumably metallic) H and\/or insulating C. This experiment, which is currently only possible at ESRF, will be a door-opener to access element-specific chemistry in dynamic compression experiments.

The evolution of the IOM at the elevated temperatures (T \u2264 800 K) inside icy worlds could have a defining impact on their habitability and chemical evolution, including the formation of an atmosphere. However, the effect on these thermal reactions of the high pressures (P \u2264 10 GPa) found inside planetary environments remains largely unknown.

In fact, the Ce1-xRExO2-x\/2 systems (RE= trivalent rare earth ion) are characterized by high ionic conductivity at low dopant amount in the 773-973 K temperature range. This property is strictly related to the structural features and to the presence of defect aggregates.

It will shed light on the pressure-induced atomic rearrangement and why the Invar effect is universal in BMGs but rare in crystalline materials. Furthermore, it is possible via the Invar effect to determine the pressure-dependence of the Curie temperature and to quantify the magnetic contribution to thermal expansion.

Particularly Ln=La and Y, show reversible capacities of 130 and 160 mA h g-1, respectively. However, these materials have not yet been assessed in Na-ion batteries. Our work focuses on the study of these materials as negative electrodes (anodes) in sodium-ion batteries, where we have demonstrated reversible capacities of 120 and 100 mAhg-1 at C\/10, respectively. Nonetheless, the charge storage mechanism for sodium uptake and removal in these materials is unknown.

Practical realization of all solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with a Li metal anode and solid-state electrolyte (SSE) will be key to unlocking higher capacities. Currently, the primary challenge for ASSBs is their interfacial instability, which affects both safety and performance. Among SSEs, sulfide-based SSEs have the highest ionic conductivity, but a lower stability, in particular the propagation of instabilities from the anode\/SSE interface into the bulk. While their deleterious effects on cell performance and safety have been explored, their precise underlying mechanisms are yet to be understood. Here we propose to use microscale, operando XRD-CT to obtain structural and morphological information on the initiation and propagation of degradation in Li|SSE|Li cells.  Such an understanding of the nucleation and propagation of interfacial instability is critical in designing stabilization strategies to mitigate them.","6434":"Mississippi Valley type (MVT) Pb-Zn deposits are becoming the main supply of germanium resources worldwide.

Interestingly we observe, that the CO conversion is favoured in presence of water vapor in the gas feed (CO+O2+H2O, \u201cwet conditions\u201d). We believe that this significant enhance in catalytic performance, is due to the formations of extremely water derived active species (e.g hydroxyl and\/or carboxyl) on top of the Pt nanoparticles and to strong metal-support interaction (creation of Pt-Fe bonds).

However, due to often ill-defined Co\/C catalysts, the exact interactions between heteroatoms such as N, S or P incorporated into the carbon support on the active cobalt phase and thus on catalyst performance and deactivation remain opaque. By combining a specifically developed heteroatom doping approach with a literature-proven colloidal Co nanoparticle (NP) synthesis, we prepared a series of well-defined and highly comparable doped (N, S, P) and non-doped carbon supported Co model catalysts, that we aim to utilize to gain insights on metal-support interactions during FTS.

Due to the contrast in thermal expansion of the different phases and heterogeneities, heating will induce thermal overpressurisation of the fluid in undrained conditions. The damage modes at the microstructure scale (inclusions) are poorly understood.

These two phases can be tailored by controlling the temperature during post production annealing. Still, despite the potential importance of this class of catalysts, little has been done to directly correlate PdCu alloy compositional and structural var iations with its electrochemical activity and durability.

In contrast, the isostructural system Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 only shows the critical contribution. It is suspected that a reduction of lattice symmetry in Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 at low temperatures is responsible for the origin of the fundamentally distinct behavior.

Ferrian brucite, (Mg0.8FeIII0.2)(OH)1.8O0.2, has recently been synthesized at 200 \u00b0C by hydrothermal alteration of ferroan brucite, (Mg0.8FeII0.2)(OH)2, a mineral found in serpentinites. Ferrian brucite is isostructural to brucite with ferric iron replacing ferrous iron in octahedral position, charged balance by H vacancies. Indeed synthetic brucite (ferroan and ferrian) is prone to oxidation and carbonation in air what renders sample post-mortem characterization unreliable.

The process of As accumulation, distribution and metabolization in algae cells needs to be understood in order to assess the toxicity and the environmental effects. Preliminary results indicate heterogeneous distribution of the arsenic in the cell, with high arsenic accumulation on cell walls. However, the form in which arsenic binds to the wall is not inferred from only bulk speciation. Thus, we aim to characterize the As speciation in the cell compartments of Sargassum algae, focusing on the differences in species between the cell walls and the cell internal organelles, to elucidate the mechanisms of As binding and storage. Moreover, the As speciation during the seaweed degradation will be studied by comparing samples collected from the open sea and from the stockpiled in the beach, which will make possible to assess the As potential environmental effects.","6636":"Aqueous solutions of chitosan and phosphate salts are highly attractive biomaterials to deliver and encapsulate cell populations, as they are liquid at neutral pH and room temperature and form hydrogels at body temperature.

Using time-resolved SAXS and XPCS, we will systematically explore the formation of microscopic structures during gelation as a function of chitosan concentration. We aim to decipher the physical mechanism controlling the formation of these colloidal-like chitosan particles, as well as their attractive interactions.

Here, we want to observe the collapse of the phonon as the CDW is formed, at the CDW q vector (0.341, 0, 0)a*. 2H-TaS2 has also been shown to be superconducting below ~1 K, with a strong crystallographic anisotropy. As seen in other TMD materials, the superconducting state could be heavily affected by the CDW state, specifically, the anisotropy.

An example of such instability is a acidic water flow through porous rocks leading to formation of karst. In experimental setups such conditions are analyzed using rock cores injected with acid. A variety of flow and acid conditions lead to varying wormhole geometry, with well known links between them for single phase flows. When a second, non-wetting phase is added, new geometrical and time scales are introduced to the system changing its dynamical properties.\r\n\r\nHowever, studies reveal contradictory effects of the second phase on wormholes depending on the type of second phase and how it arises. These contradictory effects can be resolved by observation of the dynamics of the second phase in the rock\/wormhole.

The current global warming crisis have pushed the building industry to search for new and sustainable solutions. New breakthrough technologies for lowering the CO2 footprint include a circular utilization of demolished concrete. This technology, currently under development by the cement industry, consists in the reactions between the hydraulic cement components and their hydration products with carbonate ions (from the injected CO2) in an aqueous medium, which lead to the formation of carbonate minerals and therefore to the permanent storage of the CO2 in solid form. Here, we aim to understand the carbonate mineral formation pathways in the complex environment of a recycled cement paste using in situ PDF analyses of total scattering data.","6647":"The proposed work will apply x-ray scanning micro-diffraction (\u00b5XRD) and x-ray micro fluorescence imaging (\u00b5XRF) to histological sections of human brain tissue to map the distribution of fibrillar aggregates of these proteins and the correlated abnormal deposition of specific elements in or around plaques and tangles.

Secondly, to construct a model to predict optimal structures for low TDD layers. Measurements performed on the ID01 beamline proved that it is possible to measure the change in lattice tilt of the GaN and silicon (Si) layers before and after coalescence which proved that the growth occurs as expected. Simpler samples are needed to better understand the growth process. Using an alternative sample,  insight into pillar coalescence in lines was gained through dark field X-ray microscopy measurements on ID06, but the low intensity of thin Si layers prevented examination of Si behavior.

Ptychographic tomography relies on 2D ptychography to supply projections to conventional tomographic algorithms, whilst multi-slice ptychography uses the redundancy in ptychographic data to split the reconstruction into a series of axial slices. Whilst multi-slice ptychography can handle thick specimens and has a much smaller data requirement than ptychographic tomography, its depth resolution is relatively poor. Here we propose an imaging modality that combines the benefits of the two approaches, enabling isotropic 3D resolution imaging with a smaller number of angular measurements than theoretically required by 4-5 times.","6660":"To meet the rapid goals of electrification of the transport sector, it is imperative to build batteries that have a higher capacity, and are resilient and safe.

However, this higher capacity per cycle comes at the cost of cycling stability. Particularly when accessing high voltages, these materials are prone to cracking. Therefore, in order to improve the stability of low-Co\/high-Ni NMCs, we aim to systematically study the underlying mechanism for this high voltage morphological instability. Specifically, we aim to conduct experiments of polycrystal and single crystal NMCs with varying Ni content, to better understand the role of inter-granular anisotropy in causing high voltage instabilities in high Ni NMCs.

The main objective of this project is to detect the presence of iron in the lysosomes along the axons of primary rat hippocampal neurons. We will also investigate the effect of iron overload on iron re-distribution in axons and neurons. These objectives can only be demonstrated using a correlative approach combining high spatial resolution and high sensitivity SXRF (Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence) iron imaging with super-resolution microscopy of lysosomes in axons.

However, eventual cerium 4f1 valence instability, often accompanied by development of the Kondo screening effect, cannot be neglected. XAS is a unique tool enabling to discriminate the valence state of the magnetic Ce atoms because of the drastic differences of spectral features between Ce 4f1-4f0. High-pressure XAS measurements will therefore provide an important insight into the underlying physics at the microscale and thus will permit to complete the picture of the pressure-driven development of Ce2Pd2In magnetism.","6729":"We will characterize as a function of temperature (from RT to 10K)  the diffraction signatures of the magnetic ordering in V2O3 thin crystals shaped with Focused Ion Beam.\r\n\r\n  ","6730":"The controlled plastic deformation of ferroelectric crystals has been shown to be a promising route to enhance functional properties such as piezoelectricity.

Confirmation of a non-zero orbital moment in VBr3 is crucial for understanding the origin of strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The XMCD signal at the V K-edge (not directly involving d-bands) originates from a spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-zero OM in the final p-band and possible hybridization between p and d-bands. Therefore, one might expect a robust K-edge XMCD signal if OM in VBr3 is not quenched, making this technique well-suited for our study.

To this end, we are currently developing Texture tomography to study the crystallographic texture in 3D. With this technique, we will understand the crystalline texture of the mineral in mouse achilles tendon enthesis (ATE) and compare it to the organization of the collagen fibrils on the nanoscale measured by SAXS tensor tomography.

This patterning if altered results in malformations of cortical development (MCD) associated with ND clinical manifestations. Despite progress in MCD diagnosis, the cellular mechanisms regulating the sequential acquisition of PC identity and the orderly buildup of cortex remain poorly understood.

However, MEA-based CO2E often suffers from poor stability and selectivity variations. Flooding of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and the formation of salt precipitation in the GDE cause CO2 mass transport limitations at the catalyst layer, which in turn increases competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. These results indicate that the structure of catalyst layer (CL) and ion transport mechanism of anion exchange membrane (AEM) could largely influence both flooding and salt precipitation in the GDE. In this proposal, we expect proper hydrophobicity of CL and permeability of AEM could alleviate the flooding\/salt precipitation by regulating accessibility of water transport from the anode side.  We plan to employ different GDEs with varying hydrophobicity of CL and different AEMs with varying water uptake to optimize the water transport.","6749":"This experiment aims to map the local variations of Gd magnetization profile through the thickness of GdFeCo ferrimagnetic films with a deliberately designed Gd variation through the film thickness.

NaMgF3 is a ferroelastic perovskite isostructural to bridgmanite, both belong to the sub-space-group Pbnm of the cubic perovskite structure and exhibit extensive twinning. When the direction of the stress is reversed, the perovskites will de-twin or form new twin domains. Thus, a cycling stress field causes twin domain switching and produces stress-strain hysteresis loops whose enclosed area is a measure of dissipated elastic energy. With increasing temperature, the Pbnm lattice distortion decreases, making it easier for twin domains to switch. A similar process may influence intrinsic attenuation of seismic waves travelling through bridgmanite.

We hypothesized that a stronger isotopic fractionation occurred in oxygen-rich seawater, when Ce got oxidized from +III to +IV onto Fe-oxide precipitates. The use of XANES to probe the redox state of Ce into different mineral phases in the pre and syn-GOE sediment samples is crucial to test this hypothesis.

","6812":"The usage of Cu-based fungicides in agriculture is restricted in the EU (EU 2018\/1981) due to soil contamination. There is an urgent need to enhance the efficiency of the allowed Cu dosages. Cu-based nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) can be an efficient fungicide alternative. They present higher leaf affinity than ionic Cu, drastically reducing Cu wash-off and subsequent application dose and frequency. In a previous session at the ESRF, we assessed the Cu-NPs transformations and spatial distribution at the leaf surface and in the plant after uptake. However, fungal infections will likely modulate the leaf surface microenvironment (pH modification) due to pathogen metabolites released while colonizing the leaf, likely changing Cu speciation and distribution in the leaf. We aim to understand the pathogen's impact on the possible Cu-species transformation and subsequent changes in its spatial distribution along with the associated adhesion and translocation.","6815":"HERCULES","6817":"Tomography scans on bulk samples of MnAlC pieces and composite wires of steel-LaFeSiMn","6819":"This proposal aims to study the well-defined cobalt-based FT catalysts reduction process, with particular attention to the cobalt particle sintering, their crystallographic structure, chemical coordination environment under H2 atmosphere, including elevated temperatures, high pressures (60 bar), using synchrotron X-ray techniques: x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), by in situ\/operando characterisation.","6820":"Freezing can lead to irreversible damage on biotherapeutic macromolecules. This has been attributed to stresses like the ice interface, freeze-concentration and solute crystallisation.

The expansion of crystallizing water, combined with physical restrictions form neighbouring ice crystals and increased viscosity of the freeze-concentrated solution may explain this effect. The objective of the proposed study is to confirm the additional X-ray diffraction peaks in frozen aqueous solutions, which showed some thermal diffuse scattering.   Measurements will be performed at different temperatures, with pure water and solutions of proteins and low molecular weight solutes, aiming to clarify this critical variable that may have been overlooked.","6821":"Micrometeorites (MMs) are 4.5 billion years old dust size particles (<300 micrometers) derived from the comet-forming region. When they enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, MMs experience various degrees of heating that change their original texture and composition. Some remain intact while others are fully molten. Unmolten, pristine MMs provide a unique opportunity to directly study the most primitive material in the Solar System. However, distinguishing between pristine and molten MMs using standard petrological techniques partially consumes the material, which prevents further investigation to extract meaningful isotopic data. Thus, we propose to use X-ray nanotomography (nanoCT) on beamline ID16B to non-destructively obtain 3D petrological and textural characterization of a set of 15 MMs, enabling us, for the first time, to determine and compare their nucleosynthetic isotope composition with that of planets and asteroids to test Solar System formation models.","6822":"New high performances aluminum alloys used for additive manufacturing are designed in order to benefit from the very high cooling rate offered by the process.

By changing the Zr content in the alloy, the volume fraction of equiaxed zone is monitored. The evolution of stress distribution as a function of the thermal treatment applied will be quantified by 3D \u00b5Laue profiles before and after an ex situ thermal treatment.

Neuroprotection is demanded in eye disorders such as glaucoma, where death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and neurodegeneration along the nuclei of the visual pathway take place through different mechanisms. Mitochondria are involved in cellular processes ranging from metabolic functions to calcium homeostasis and the regulation of cell death.

However, the selectivity and the yield to methanol of this process are low. To maximize turnover per metal site, we desire structures where every or most metal sites are exposed on a surface. Metal-organic frameworks emerged as an attractive template to derive nanostructured metal oxide particles dispersed in a porous carbon matrix. In this work, we synthesized metal oxide-derived Cu-doped Ce\/Zr mixed cluster in UiO-66 with various Ce\/Zr metal ratios. The controlled pyrolysis helps to avoid sintering of the formed metal oxides, and we expect the Cu species to be well dispersed in the support structure. However, the structure of the materials has not yet elucidated.

On the other hand, the goal is to consolidate the previously carried out measurements and to go deeper in order to answer the remaining questions. In this way, one aim is to determine if the slowdown of the relaxation times observed with the increase of crystallinity arises from a constraining effect due to the formation of crystalline lamellae and\/or originates from an increase of nanoparticles concentration (i.e. tracers) into the amorphous domains involved by a segregation effect. Also, more precise and exhaustive measurements will be carried out on stretched samples in order to confirm the fact the dynamics heterogeneities and to determine the critical orientation degree above which they are observed.","6839":"Hemopexin (Hpx) is a plasma glycoprotein with very high affinity for heme. It can mitigate heme-mediated oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction and has promising therapeutic applications for hemolytic disorders. The uptake of heme-Hpx is accompanied by an increase in intracellular Cu levels, thus hinting at a dynamic interaction between Cu and Hpx. In vitro studies have indicated that Cu(II) can disrupt heme-Hpx complex formation. Consequently, it has been proposed that Cu(II) binds to Hpx under the acidic endosomal conditions, preventing heme re-binding. This project seeks to elucidate the interplay between Cu and heme binding to Hpx. To this end, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy will be used for the first time to characterize heme- and Cu-binding sites in Hpx in different pH conditions to understand (i) how Cu(II) is bound at both pH, (ii) whether it can be released upon reduction by physiological agents and (iii) what is the mutual impact of Cu- and heme-binding.","6840":"Conodonts, marine organisms from the Paleozoic to Triassic eras (495-199.6 Ma), are notable for their fossilized denticles central to their feeding.

Even though Ca-Pv have been intensively investigated over the last decades, our knowledge on fate of Ca-Pv in the presence of water is very limited, also due to the methodological limitations. In order to provide a comprehensive picture on Ca-Pv-H2O interactions at conditions of the lower mantle, we propose to perform in situ powder and single-crystal multi-grain X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) at pressures 30-120 GPa and temperatures 1500-2900 K.

These studies suggest a correlation between the H2O content and the pressure at which a hydrated borate undergoes a phase transition, but more studies are needed to confirm a real trend.  The main goals of this project are: i) to assess the high-pressure and the combined high-temperature\/high-pressure stability range of these minerals, ii) to unravel the P-deformation mechanisms of borax and probertite, at the atomic scale iii) to collect high-quality single-crystal data in order to solve the structure of their high-pressure polymorphs.

From these, and based on a variety of analytical techniques, we observed the structural\/kinetic features of PAn-OCn chemistry. Most importantly, our data suggested the presence of a reaction intermediate, which, due to low occupancy and short life-time, we could not structurally characterize.

Therefore, we propose an experiment to measure these smart magnetic systems' dynamics in dependence on temperature and magnetic field strength using XPCS and XCCA. We want to investigate the translational as well as the rotational dynamics of anisotropic active cobalt ferrite nanoparticles embedded in the smart polymer matrix.

Our two experiments at the FAME-UHD beamline investigated the temporal dynamics of Se speciation in the topsoil and different parts of the rice and wheat plants over a rice-wheat crop rotation season in a seleniferous agriculture plot, where rice crop residue had been incorporated for four years. Results showed that organic Se is the dominant Se reservoir in this soil, and plants primarily uptake Se from the soil as organic Se. However, the origin of this organic Se in soil could not be identified conclusively due to the limited number of sample analyses.

Specifically, Li2MnSeO and Li2FeSeO are of particular interest due to simplicity of preparation and abundancy of elements. Our preliminary experiments indicated that Li2MnSeO shows high working potential while Li2FeSeO provides high capacity. However, further improvements of these materials are impeded by the lack of understanding of their mechanism during electrochemical cycling in LIB. As the structure evolution upon cycling can be elucidated by the combination of ex situ and operando measurements, we expect to gain deeper insights into the de\/lithiation mechanism of AP cathodes. ","6890":"This study investigated the growth and development strategies of new, small bodied archosauromorphs from the Early Triassic fossil l\u00e4gerstatte (upper Olenekian) Driefontein 11  Driefontein preserves thousands of microvertebrates, and presents a unique opportunity for investigating the physiological mechanisms for the early radiation of the Archosaurosauromorpha.O steohistological synchrotron imaging of limb bones from a broad range of morphologies representing diverse groups across the basal archosauromorph radiation showed an incredible diversity in growth strategies and bone tissue types. These results challenge the existing hypothesis of fast growth rates and high metabolic rates as plesiomorphies of archosauromorphs, instead showing that their initial radiation featured disparate growth strategies.","6891":"Our research programme aims at designing and preparing innovative nanostructured systems of different shape, size and composition, mainly made of noble metals and ad hoc functionalized with appropriate organic or organometallic molecules, for a wide range of applications ranging from pollutants sensing to nanomedicine to optoelectronics and quantum optics. In this framework, we recently designed and synthesised chiral nanoparticles (NPs) made of Au and Ag and stabilized by L-cysteine, by following a bottom-up approach leading to chiral nanostructures (as proved by preliminary optical and morphological characterization); in this strategy, the chiral biomolecule L-cysteine is envisaged to act as template to drive the synthesis toward a chiral structure of the NPs. Here, we plan to perform XAS at the Ag K-edge and Au L(III)-edge to gather information about the local structure at the cysteine-silver and cysteine-gold interface and to characterize the metal local structure.","6892":"Plastic is present in our daily lives because it is a flexible material, resistant, light and insulating against electricity and heat, which makes it indispensable in almost all sectors: packaging, construction, automotive, medicine, agriculture, etc. Although these characteristics that make it a very practical and versatile material, it has the drawback that its widespread use generates a huge volume of waste worldwide. Due to their slow degradation they accumulate in the environment.  Nowadays, the presence of plastics and microplastics in the sea is a problem of concern  for sea organisms and is a potential source of plastic for humans through the diet. Metal labelled micro\/nanoparticles have potential to evaluate plastic fate in the environat ID21, plastic micro\/nanoparticles will be probed by means of XRF mapping and XANES to elucidate the metal speciation in the plastics. \n","6894":"Kirkendall porosity forms and develops in joints made of different materials exposed to high temperatures over a long period of time. This is due to the diffusion of elements accompanied by a vacancy flux. Hence, in a materials combination of pure Ni and Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 joined by diffusion welding, alloying elements move from CMSX-4 to pure Ni, while Ni atoms and vacancies move in the opposite direction. However, the detailed development of the Kirkendall porosity, such as the time of the start of the pore formation and then of further growth, also in relation to the distance to the diffusion-welded interface, is still unknown. Furthermore, the shape of the developing voids depends on time, temperature and crystallographic orientations. In-situ 3D \u00b5-tomography can answer the kinetics of the forming and developing Kirkendall porosity.

Several pieces, such as those from the Qionglai kilns, display opaque green areas which are suspected to be coloured by recycling ancient Chinese bronzes. This study focuses on one such piece, which display a green splash on a brownish background. No trace of Sn or Pb has been measured on this sample according to prior analysis, which invalidate the hypothesis of bronze recycling for this piece. The origin of the green opaque coloration is thus still unknown, and will be studied by Cu and Fe K-edge XAS.

Recent theoretical proposals have brought into play a third flavour called altermagnetism. This version of magnetic order expresses characteristics of FM and AFM simultaneously by lifting spin degeneracies whilst exhibiting net zero magnetization. Yet, a clear-cut experimental fingerprint reflected in the excited state spectrum awaits detection. Here, we propose to use circular-dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS) to probe the unique spectroscopic signatures of an altermagnetic candidate material. The interference of FM and AFM properties giving rise to this novel magnetic state should be well mirrored in the orbital and magnetic excitations. By momentum-mapping these excitations using CD-RIXS, we aim to provide unambiguous evidence for altermagnetism and pave the way to a systematic approach for the investigation of a wide range of candidate materials.","6911":"Gas hydrates have received considerable attention in the last decades due to their extensive natural occurrence on Earth and extraterrestrial bodies, and to their significant applications in sustainable technologies.  In particular, hydrogen hydrates offer carbon-free high energy content per unit mass (~14 MJ\u00b7kg-1). They are promising functional materials for clean energy storage and offer alternative to the current cryo-compressed hydrogen storage technology, insuring low production and operational costs, environmentally benign nature, and lower risk of flammability. In this proposal, we aim to explore the temperature and pressure stability range for a controlled hydrogen release from C2 (H2O\u00b7H2) and C3 (H2O\u00b72H2) hydrogen-filled ices.","6912":"The antiferromagnetic structure of the Au-Al-Tb 1\/1 periodic approximant has recently been determined by neutron powder diffraction. Our recent x-ray magnetic diffraction measurements on a single crystal have confirmed the magnetic space group, but suggest an orientation of the spins differing by ~20\u00b0 with respect to the published structure. We plan to collect additional data to confirm our results.","6914":"  In industry applications, parts are subjected to overloads leading to void, crack and eventually part replacement. A solution to increase the lifetime of components is to use self-healing materials. These materials have the ability to close their voids and damage with the application of a heat treatment. The healing capacity of AlMgZr alloys manufactured by LPBF will be analysed. The microstructure is composed of an Al3Mg2 eutectic network,  \u03b1-Al dendritic particles and Zr precipitates. To optimise the manufacturing process of new alloys and the healing heat treatment process a phase-field model will be develop to predict the microstructure evolution of the material during the healing heat treatment. To validate the model it is necessary to analyse different samples before and after the healing process. Nanoholotomography allows to analyse the same area before and after the process to track the damage and voids and to evaluate the healing potential of the material.","6915":"Quantum Devices are often manufactured using semiconductor heterestructures. It is important to study the variations of strain in these devices to get a better understanding of the strain effects on functionality.","6917":"The main objective is to investigate the phase, microstructure and elastic strain evolution in Si-anode based solid-state batteries (SSBs) as a function of the applied stack pressure as well as the charge-discharge rate by using operando XRD using our newly developed operando set-up at the BM31. Si is one of the most promising anode materials due to its high specific capacity. Although SSBs utilizing Si show attractive application prospects, current results are still in an infant state. In particular, the phase evolution, comprising amorphization and re-crystallization during charge and discharge, as well as the actually amount of Si utilization, which is expected to by significant influenced by stack pressure, are lacking in understanding. This study will shed light on the underlying processes taking place during operation and will therefore propel the battery field toward engineered silicon anodes that meet the requirements for large-scale adoption of SSBs.","2825":"Pathogenic mechanisms of absestos-related diseases are still not well understood. In chrysotile, the most commercialized asbestos, Fe and other toxic metals are worth considering in its pathogenicity. Their release is strictly connected to that of Mg when fibres are dissolved in the lung environment. In vitro THP1-cells studies with chrysotile fibres, reporting the contribution of Fe in cells mortality, demonstrated the formation of aggregated structures of both fibrous and non-fibrous species. In these clusters, we identified micrometric iron compounds by Raman spectroscopy as Fe oxides and sulphides. Dissolution products herein needs further investigation, especially in the spatial distribution of elemental Fe and toxic metals.
