    "summary":"We developed a crystallization strategy that promotes in-plane growth of ZIF-L on nanoporous single-layer graphene, forming a few unit-cell-thick film. This 2D morphology of the MOF film allows us to achieve extremely attractive gas separation performance marked by H2 permeance over 1000 GPU accompanied with H2\/N2 selectivities of over 40. While electron diffraction in TEM along the [001] zone axis seem to confirm the structure of ZIF-L, we could not obtain in-depth understanding of lattice parameter and crystallinity of the ZIF-L film, partly arising from the fact that ZIF-L is not stable under the electron beam. In particular, our interest is to understand the similarilty and differences of the novel 2d film with reference to the known 3D structure. Finally, the synthesis strategy, based on promotion of in-plane grain growth and etching of out-of-plane growth, is extremely attractive to replicate to wider range of two-dimensional MOFs and MOFs interesting for carbon capture.\r\n",

These disagreements are either due to a distortion of the lattice or to the presence of impurities. Either way, we need to clarify this to fully understand the structure and magnetism in our samples.

In this proposal we will examine the dynamic structural changes occurring in situ under pressure and temperature of 6 different materials: [(CH3CH2CH2CH2)4N][M(N(CN)2)3] (M = Mn2+ or Cd2+) [1, 2], (C10H21NH3)2MnCl4 [3], (C9H19NH3)2MnCl4 [3],  (NH4)2SO4 [4], and CH(NH2)2I [5], with some of the largest BC tunability and reversible entropy changes known.

Their complex cycling mechanism, undergoing through a series of transformations combining crystalline and amorphous phases, make CAMs challenging to understand on the basis of chemical structures even with the most informative operando techniques. We have recently observed that Sb-based CAMs have surprisingly high capacity at high charge rates, and preliminary operando XRD results suggest that this may be because of different cycling mechanisms compared to slower charge rates, suggesting that kinetics plays a crucial role in the formation of certain phases during cycling. Thus, this experiment will focus on elucidating the main structural differences in the reaction mechanism of a selection of Sb-based CAMs and their Bi- and Sn-analogues as a function of the applied cycling rates with operando XRD.

It is further known, that monazites can accommodate tetravalent actinides.

This can be achieved via varius synthesis routes. For U4+ and Th4+, several records of successful substitution exist.

The hydrothermal conditions during APR lead to changes in metal oxidation state,  re-dispersion and dealloying of the catalyst nanoparticles. Thus, operando XAS and XRD studies will be conducted to determine the local environment, dispersion and metal phase of Pt and Mn in samples prepared by different synthesis methods. The experiments are expected to give insight into the catalyst changes during the reaction, which may lead to deactivation.

This experiment will focus on two main groups of materials: Bi and Sb-based compounds for Na-ion batteries.  Both types of materials create amorphous phases during cycling that we want to characterize with operando PDF to get a more complete understanding of their cycling mechanism.

The formation of these gradients is the main reason commercial LIB architectures cannot consistently undergo fast (dis)charge. Currently, no analytical method can observe both solution-phase and solid-phase concentration gradients simultaneously in LIBs. In collaboration with the ESRF, we recently demonstrated the ability to visualize both the solution-phase Li+ gradient and solid-phase state of charge (SoC) simultaneously through tandem X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the ID-31 beamline.

    "summary":"Nickel coordinated within pyridinic nitrogen on a carbon backbone structure (Ni-N-C) has extraordinary electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ni-N-Cs can substitute platinum group metal (PGM) in order to reduce device costs. Synthesys for these electrocatalysts is based on pyrolytic processes with controlled temperature and atmosphere. The identification of the metal containing active sites and understanding of their formation during pyrolysis is crucial to enhance the M-N-C synthesis processes and active site reactivity. X-ray Adsorption Spectroscopy (XAS) will be used to reach our main goal, to define speciation of the Ni during pyrolysis, occurring at constant T (up to 800\u00b0C with 50\u00b0C step). This in-situ study, supported by ex-situ samples prepared at constant temperature, will: i) reveal the dynamics formation of Ni containing active sites during pyrolysis; ii) identify the temperature in which the desired active sites are formed.",

Although the mechanism of DMTM is debated, Cu(I)\/(II) redox speciation, and especially Cu reducibility, plays a key role in this reaction. Currently, the main technique used to quantitatively assess Cu oxidation state in these materials is XANES spectroscopy. We have been currently developing a new technique to titrate Cu(I) on such systems, based on the specific interaction of CO with this species, that exploits isothermal volumetric adsorption as a quantitative tool. This methodology, however, could be affected by the lack of accessibility of Cu(I) ions by CO within the zeolitic framework. A comparison with a well-affirmed technique for the same quantification, as Cu K-edge XAS, is thus desirable.",

Despite constituting isolated Ni sites, the rate of butene dimerization varies substantially depending upon the catalyst support and shows the following trend: Ni-FAU >> Ni-CHA > Ni-MFI >> Ni-UiO-66. We hypothesize that the local chemical environment and the electronic properties of Ni encapsulated in different supports impact the activation of butene thereby resulting in substantially different rates for butene consumption. We therefore propose to investigate the structural and electronic properties of Ni in a series of Ni-CHA, Ni-MFI, Ni-FAU, and Ni-UiO-66 catalysts, with varying Ni content, via HERFD-XANES, VtC-XES, and EXAFS measurements.",

However, the difficulty in obtaining a strong enough magnetic signal impedes its common use. For this MRI technique to work one needs to take advantage of the polarization of a metabolite which is unfortunately naturally only 1ppm. Here we propose to overcome this limitation by \"conjugating\" the desired metabolite with an inorganic mineral, in which the polarized state exhibits a relatively long relaxation time, and thus may serve as a spin reservoir and, via the process of spin diffusion, elongate the relaxation time of the metabolite. Hench, incorporating metabolites such as pyruvate into the lattice of a crystal should allow a much longer relaxation time and could potentially allow much longer and better imaging. Herein we will study the effect of incorporation of metabolites into the calcite on its lattice (ID22) and correlate it with polarization relaxations. ",

The choice of metal is strictly connected with the final use of the catalyst; therefore, we identified the nature of the dopant(s) in B-site a key role to elucidate in the nanoparticle formation.\r\nHereby, we propose to investigate the exsolution mechanism in a general system (La0.5Sr0.5)1-xTi1-xMxO3 where x = 0.10. We will investigate both single-metal M (= Ni, Cu) and bimetallic (M_(x\/2)^' M_(x\/2)^'') systems involving Ni, Cu and Fe. We believe, diffraction data analysed by Rietveld method combined with Paid Distribution Function will be precious to investigate the structure at atomic level of matrix and exsolved nanoparticles.\r\n",

The study of specifically designed adsorbents for their efficient\r\ncapture is mandatory.\r\nThis experiment is meant to get structural understanding of phosphate adsorption in three different Zr-based MOFs, which have been successfully used to remove phosphate from water solutions. UiO-66 [Zr6O4(OH)4(C8H4O4)6], NU-1000 [Zr6(\u03bc3-OH)8(\u2013OH)8(TBAPy)2] and MOF-808 [Zr6O4(OH)4(BTC)2(HCOO)6] show different connectivity: 12-\/8-\/6- connected ones recpectively. HR-PXRD data at 298 K on different phosphate loaded samples [activated and moisture saturated] will allow us to unveil for the first time the host-guest interactions and to clarify the MOF connectivity and defects role, while rebuilding the adsorption curve. This experiment will allow a deeper understanding on the (PO4)3- capture and recovery process, opening the way to the design and synthesis of improved, new generation adsorbents.",

Using an analogue of the Early Earth \u2018seawater\u2019, we followed the formation and transformation of GR and greenalite in the absence and presence of As and P. The combination of As and P is crucial because As(V) is a key competitor for phosphate, but highly toxic to all living cells.

This phenomenon termed \u2018fatigue\u2019 is crucial in studies focusing on the evaluation of extensive storage of CO2 relying on shales as an efficient sealing caprock. Shale rocks suffer cyclic loading during drilling, leading to possible near-well fracturing. In addition, thermal stresses may arise during these cycles due to the expansion cooling of the injected CO2. All these processes may affect the mechanical stability of such geological formations. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the response of the rock mass under cyclic loading conditions. The proposed experiment aims to investigate in detail the fatigue damage evolution in rocks due to the cyclic loading expected for the rock mass through the lifetime of a CO2 storage operation by using dynamic in-situ X-ray imaging using the Hades apparatus.\r\n",

    "summary":"Multiphase flow in porous media is a scientific topic of huge environmental importance, and recent advances in X-ray sources and detectors have made it feasible to study this field experimentally. Many liquid-liquid fluctuations take place on a time scale of seconds, with the pore-level Haines jumps occurring within milliseconds. It is consequently difficult to follow these processes with time-resolved 3D microscopy. Due to the short time scales, 3D imaging of these pore-scale phenomena has hitherto been limited to snapshots before and after the process has taken place. We thus propose original measurement strategies for i) real-time 3D imaging of steady-state multiphase flow fluctuations, and ii) reversible Haines jumps. We expect that these efforts will improve our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of multiphase flow, specifically testing recently published theoretical models for multiphase flow.",

The potential for postharvest Cd mitigation during fermentation was recently highlighted. Data suggest that cacao fermentation induces a mobilization of Cd in the cacao nibs (the inner part of the bean), followed by outward migration of Cd from the nib to the testa (the shell) and the mucilage. It is hypothesized that Cd mobilization during fermentation is related to breakdown of phytate in the nibs and consecutive release of phytate-bound Cd. Bulk XANES analysis can offer crucial knowledge to identify whether this correlation between phytate breakdown and nib Cd mobilization is causational or not. This knowledge can lead to the development of post-harvest techniques to reduce the Cd content in cacao beans.",

In the context of a circular economy, this project aims at extracting REEs from a secondary source: bauxite residue produced from alumina extraction.

We propose here to investigate bulk speciation of Yttrium (proxy for Heavy REEs) in bauxite residue samples formed from 2 bauxite sources (lateritic and karstic origins) as well as in the residue after partial leaching of Yttrium to better understand leaching mechanisms and how speciation affect leaching yield.

In the case of Cr, the hexavalent species, Cr(VI), is a highly mobile and toxic pollutant. Cr(VI) can often leach into groundwaters, making it crucial to understand the processes that control its mobility. Fe (oxyhydr)oxides are usually the main mineral phase in the most weathered zones of Ni laterites, and are critical hosts for Cr species. However, their role in the redox behavior and partitioning of Cr species, as well as the mechanisms involved in sequestration or release into (ground)waters is unknown. To address this, we will probe the speciation and local bonding environment of Cr in both natural Ni laterite samples and synthetic analogues using Cr K-edge XAS. Thus, we can quantify speciation changes along a vertical redox gradient in Ni laterite profiles, and evaluate Cr leaching potential into groundwaters.",

We recently synthesized the novel non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic compound Eu2Pd2Sn where the Eu2+ magnetic substructure forms 2D-puckered layers stacked along the b-axis. This proposal aims to perform a very accurate structural analysis at low temperatures of Eu2Pd2Sn in order to understand the origin of a soft-phonon-like excitation at around 25K observed in specific heat measurements. In particular this analysis could unveil if around that temperature a progressive change of structure between the high temperature orthorhombic and the suspected low temperature monoclinic polymorph occurs. This transformation between two structures of competing energy could be triggered by a charge density wave (CDW) along the linear Pd-Pd chain.",

This, however, represents only one of the two types of collective charge modes in the cuprates. As well as the three- dimensional plasmon, t-J model calculations also predict the presence of a spin polaron excitation, which is a lower energy mode that arises from the formation of a narrow polaronlike band of spin correlation dressed bosons. This proposal will use Cu L-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of La2-xCexCuO4 (LCCO) to discover the spin polaron excitation and characterize its momentum and doping dependence. The properties of this mode will provide critical information about the unconventional electron liquid that hosts high-temperature superconductivity, how it interacts with spin correlations and deepen our understanding of the t-J model and its validity.

The Mott insulating states of Sr2IrO4 and Ca2RuO4 are thought to be triggered by a combination of electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling. In Ca2RuO4, where spin-orbit coupling has a comparable energy scale to the crystal field splitting's, neutron scattering has successfully probed dispersive single magnon excitations. However, neutron scattering does not provide insight into the orbital character of these excitations. It is widely believed that interactions responsible for the Mott insulating state are encoded into this orbital texture. With the improvements provided by the ERIXS spectrometer, it is now possible to probe both orbital and spin excitations simultaneously in Ca2RuO4. We therefore propose to study the low-energy spin-orbital excitation spectrum of Ca2RuO4 via the oxygen K-edge at which ID32 delivers an energy resolution just below 30 meV.\r\n",

    "summary":"Warm dense matter describes plasma at very high densities in which long-range coupling between particles cannot be ignored. Due to the difficulties in both creating and diagnosing such matter, the theory of its behavior is underdeveloped, yet it is pervasive throughout the universe. This proposal uses a unique combination of pulsed power to produce warm dense matter conditions, and the radiographic capabilities of ID19 to provide quantitative measurements of dynamics in these plasmas. We will significantly improve upon our initial research from 2018, measuring how the electrothermal instability could affect measurements of resistivity in dense plasmas, hoping to explain fundamental questions in conductivity modelling; explore how the Richtmyer Meshkov instability is affected by plasma density, which is key to Inertial Confinement Fusion; and in new experiments study how the Kelvin Helmholtz instability forms in counterpropagating plasma flows, like those observed in stellar outflows.",

The results of the studies we propose on several samples with different growth conditions and degrees of stability can inform the relationship between the observed anisotropies and important properties of metallic glasses, pointing to the need to have structural information beyond the density-density pair distribution function.

Therefore,  it would be challenging to detect order-disorder transitions of such new dynamical materials at extremely low temperatures by synchrotron-source X-ray diffraction. Moreover, identifying rotor conformations, occupation of specific sites and symmetry changes as a function of temperature  will help explain unprecedented mobility and the mechanism of motion in the solid-state.",

However, charge density waves (CDW) demonstrated over years a clear competition with the superconductivity: they weaken below Tc and are enhanced by magnetic fields. The recently discovered charge density fluctuations (CDF) might instead represent the long-sought excitations, since their signal is not reduced below Tc. Here, we propose to study in YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 films the response of CDW and CDF to magnetic fields of the order of 1 T, which we will achieve using an optimized geometry with two permanent magnets and a concentrator, and that we already tested to induce a significant variation in the charge order signal.

Many candidate compounds have been suggested and carbon nitrides are among the most compelling.1,2 As it stands, none of the high-pressure experiments on the C-N system resulted in the full structural determination of a new carbon nitride. Here, we propose to employ the extremely powerful method of single-crystal X-ray diffraction of a polycrystalline sample (SC-XRDp) to characterize the reaction products of a laser-heated carbon-nitrogen precursor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE, C6N4), between 20 and 130 GPa.

We developed a novel class of MOFs endowed with ultra-fast rotors with energy barrier as low as 6 - 20 cal\/mol. We explored the modulation of rotational dynamics by guest species, that can be effectively applied to drive a dramatic response of the dynamic properties in the solid state. Moreover, gas adsorption could also trigger structural rearrangement of MOF structure that can affect the rotational behaviour of molecular rotors. In our endeavour to fabricate switchable ferroelectric materials and porous dynamic materials for ultra-low concentration gas detection, it would be of extreme importance the study of the interplay between gas adsorption, molecular rotors dynamic and structural phase transitions. Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction would provide fundamental information about the structure of MOFs both at variable temperatures and under gas pressure.",

They display a wide range of exotic magnetic and electronic low temperature properties, dependent on the specific rare-earth ion, due to the inherent magnetic geometric frustration of the rare-earth and Ir4+ (J = \u00bd) corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices. Surprisingly however, initial magnetic ordering of the Ir4+ sublattice appears to be primarily dependent on the A ion size, rather than the rare-earth\u2019s specific electronic properties. To investigate this relationship, we have measured the lattice compressibility and the structural evolution with pressure of several A2Ir2O7 members at room temperature and 20 K (ESRF, ID15b, HC-4856). To corroborate our very recent results, the temperature evolution of structural parameters is proposed to be investigated.

    "summary":"Recent resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies have revealed low-energy plasmon excitations in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, highlighting their relevance for the normal state and superconducting properties. Moreover, the plasmonic charge excitations in cuprates are well described by the t-J-V model with long-range Coulomb interaction, providing a new way to determine the charge dynamics and related electronic energy scales. Here, we propose to apply this sensitivity of RIXS to study the newly discovered infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. From the plasmon spectra we will determine the parameter set that describes the low-energy physics of the nickelates, which is so far missing. In this fashion, key questions including their similarities to the cuprates, especially the strength of electronic interactions can be addressed. Furthermore, by following the evolution of charge excitations as a function of Tc, their roles in superconductivity will be examined.",

The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the wholly uncharted W-C-N system between ambient pressure and 130 GPa using laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DAC) and synthesize novel ternary compounds. To realize this aim, the crystal structure of the newly synthesized compounds, along with their corresponding synthesis conditions, will be elucidated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of polycrystalline samples. This proposal serves as a logical continuation of the recent achievements in both the C-N and W-N systems conducted in our group.\r\n",

Despite numerous publications devoted to the investigation of TMOs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which occurs at the anode and largely dominates the energy losses, the nature of the active sites is not fully understood yet, hindering the development of materials for water electrolysis. TMOs with spinel structure constitute a promising class of materials due to a relatively low synthesis temperature, and to their composition-dependent and widely tunable properties.

Its implementation has been proven on laboratory sources [1], but it has been hard to implement on synchrotron sources so far. So far, all attempts have used a so-called Computational GI approach. This approach suffers from multiple limitations: flat-field and intensity discrepancies between XRF and mask measurements, drifts in the masks positions, and non-ideal response of the beam intensity monitors.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed experiment, we will develop a new XRF GI acquisition scheme that overcomes the above mentioned limitations. We will develop new acquisition setup and control scheme, in order to simultaneously acquire XRF and mask measurements. This will remove discrepancies between measurements, and reliable intensity monitoring.\r\n\r\n[1] 10.1364\/OPTICA.441682",

However, little has been reported about the fate that these nanoparticles follow once they have performed their function in the human body and this aspect is essential if they are to be used for clinical applications. In this experiment, we aim to study the long-term intracellular degradation process that magnetosomes undergo in 3D models (spheroids) of human lung carcinoma cells (A549) by tracking the structural and electronic changes that Fe atoms undergo by means of Fe K-edge XANES spectroscopy. In parallel, the degradation of iron oxide commercial nanoparticles designed for biomedical applications will be studied to compare with that of magnetosomes.",

    "summary":"In order to control their high redox activity, in living systems Cu ions are normally coordinated to proteins and short peptides. One of the main functions of Cu in biology is as a catalytic redox centre in enzymes where the role of Cu is often to activate dioxygen. The coordination chemistry of Cu(II) and Cu(I) bound to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are very different (e.g. in the case of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Similar differences in the coordination chemistry is also reported in the Cu-\u03b1-synuclein that is related to Parkinson disease. Such flexible Cu-IDP are quite competent in di-oxygen activation to form reactive oxygen species, which could contribute to the oxidative stress observed in the diseases.Hence a central question is how this redox process can occur. In fact, going from Cu(II) to Cu(I) and back needs a quite important rearrangement of the peptide around the Cu-ion. Answering this question is the main goal of the present proposal.",

Answering these questions is key for understanding the evolutionary history of living crocodilians and requires sampling broadly across fossil crocodilians using osteohistological methods. A challenge for this line of research is that classical osteohistology requires destructive sampling, and early crocodylomorphs are rare components of the fossil record. Synchrotron microtomography offers a non-destructive alternative to destructive approaches and has already shown great promise in imaging internal bone microstructures. In this study, we propose to use PPC-SR\u03bcCT at submicron voxel size to image osteohistological cross sections of the long bones of four key fossil species from South Africa. This study builds a framework for understanding growth strategies across Crocodylomoprha and other vertebrate clades.",

    "summary":"Copper is an essential trace element in humans and therapeutic approaches based on the interaction of synthetic ligands with Cu attracted considerable medicinal interest. For instance, Cu-ligand complexes (Cu-L) are intensively investigated as anticancer agents. An often-implicated mechanism of cytotoxicity in cancer cells is the increased production of reactive oxygen species catalysed by the Cu-L. This can occur in the presence of native reductants, such as ascorbate or glutathione (GSH), under aerobic conditions. Based on the literature and our recent results, the lysosome might be an important place of action for these Cu-L. Moreover, the GSH oxidation by Cu-phenanthroline complexes increased at lower pH, such as the typical lysosome value 5. Therefore, the present project aims to understand why the catalytic activity increases at lower pH. This is of fundamental interest as thiol reactivity normally drops with pH and this finding could be of importance in the anticancer mechanism.",

Interestingly, the fusion domain of the spike protein triggers the fusion between viral and host membranes, initializing the infection. However, the molecular mechanism regulating this process has not been deeply understood. Our approach to date has been to study the interaction of several putative fusion peptides at or near the N-terminus of S2 subunit with model membranes in the form of monolayers, composed of cholesterol and natural lipids extracted from yeast cells. A  combination of different X-ray surface scattering methods available at ID10 beamline (XRR, GISAXS, and GIXD) will help to answer questions still not answered such as how does the fusion region induces the reorganization of the lipid packing, as well as, how is the fusion process modulated by lipid composition and environmental factors such as the presence of divalent cations.",

We have recently shown that structural changes in CarH after light absorption can be followed by time-resolved X-ray scattering (LS-2958). To disentangle tertiary and quaternary signals, we performed a second experiment ( LS-3091) on a mutant (H132A-CarH) and a homolog of CarH in which quaternary changes are prevented or modified, respectively. The previous experiments enabled us to follow the cascade of structural events occurring in CarH on a time scale from \u00b5s to hundreds of ms. A comparison with static data showed that the relevant time scale of the photoreaction in native CarH extends longer than hundreds of ms, most likely because of the presence of large scale slow quaternary changes leading to the photoproduct. Here we propose to complete our study by collecting time-resolved scattering data in native CarH on the time scale from ms to several s.",

Slit proteins and their cognate binding partners, the cell surface Roundabout (Robo) receptors family, are one of four major neuronal developmental guidance cues pathways. The implication of Slit-Robo signalling in other fundamental biological processes also makes it an attractive therapeutic target. However, while Slit2 and Robo1 are well studied there are still open questions about how Slit binding triggers Robo signalling at the cell surface. More recently, we have recombinantly produced several Slit2 constructs, including an uncleavable version (Slit2-U), all incorporating a 6xHis tag. We propose to screen these to identify the minimal version of Slit2 necessary for Robo1 endocytosis, and the cellular effect of a Slit2-U. Next, we would like to determine if Slit2 is internalised with Robo1, and if so, its cellular location and correlate this with Robo1 light microscopy.  ",

However, reports of fossil MB-like tissues are contentious because MB resembles avian bone pathologies (BP). Recently, our team made progress establishing criteria unique to MB, with the goal of discriminating it from BP. We studied MB and BP in over 60 bird species and found that i) MB skeletal distribution is linked to pneumaticity, differing from BP; ii) MB microstructure is uniform among neognaths and small paleognaths, but may differ in large ratites, the most ancestral bird species; iii) some avian BP have a similar molecular composition as MB. In light of our discoveries, our project aims at reassessing the nature of purported MB-like tissues in pterosaurs and non-avian dinosaurs using Synchrotron X-ray imaging.",

    "summary":"This proposal aims at unveiling the chemical reactivity of nanoparticles in inorganic liquids, ie. molten salts, which are highly relevant to design new materials for electrocatalysis applied to energy conversion. Because these liquids operate between 300 and 700\u00b0C, they require special approaches in order to probe reactions in situ. Herein we want to understand structural transformations of metal nanoparticles when they react with boron and phosphorus in molten salts, and to evidence the formation of new solids with potentially high impact for energy conversion. In situ time resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering (PDF analysis) will enable evaluating the composition and temperature ranges where intermediates and new solids, including amorphous phases, form and then crystallize during the reaction. These data will unveil new solids and nanomaterials and provide the first understanding of reaction mechanisms into molten salts.",

    "summary":"Lead-free antiferroelectric (AFE) materials have shown promising energy storage properties that can surpass the currently used PbZrO3-based antiferroelectrics. But while the high energy density of AgNbO3 bulk ceramics is comparable to that of lead-based AFE, its full potential of energy storage performance and working-temperature range has not yet been realized, primarily due to the lack of understanding of phase stability under external perturbation. The effect of mechanical stress on the temperature-dependent AFE phase boundaries. Investigating this relationship is crucial to implement lead-free AFE materials into applications by improving the working temperature range of AgNbO3-based capacitors. Therefore, we propose an in situ mechanical stress and temperature-dependent investigation of AgNbO3 crystal structure to reveal the effect of bias stress on the AFE phase stability and thus allow the use of bias stress to modify the AFE phase stability of other material systems.

In contrast to the more common filamentary switching, manganite devices can switch homogeneously over the whole device and might be superior with respect to their cell-to-cell and cycle-to-cycle variability. However, it is still unclear which are the nanoscale interface mechanisms governing RS. Performing operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will enable us to gain insights into the chemical and structural changes taking place. The main objectives of this proposal are to: 1) experimentally measure the structural and chemical changes related to RS with time-resolved resolution (scale of seconds) by operando electrical measurements; and 2) obtain spatially resolved XAS maps below and between the electrodes with micrometric resolution before, during and after the change in resistance.",

    "summary":"Metal NPs are organised in metal core, surface coating, and protein corona. Optical microscopy suggests that degradation of these elements in cells occurs at different rates, but fluorescence probes can detach or get degraded. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using nanofocused X-ray is ideal to study the localisation of metal NPs with subcellular resolution. Recently, we developed a method to label surface coatings of NPs with brominated tags. This allowed performing XRF and XANES that confirmed differential cellular degradation of cores and coatings of Au NPs after long incubations. Yet, we do not know what happen at short incubations, or with the protein corona formed around those NPs. We want to use XRF maps in cells treated with colloidal NPs at ID16A to probe the relative localisation between Au cores, Br coatings and Gd-labelled proteins. This will provide new insight into the cellular degradation process of colloidal NPs, which is important to assess their potential as biomedical tools.",

    "summary":"Al parts might be subjected to overloads leading to voids, cracks and the replacement of the part. A promising solution is to use self-healing material. A self-healing Al alloy was produced by SLM based on Al-Si and Mg powder. The microstructure is composed of a Si network and Mg2Si precipitates in a \u03b1-Al matrix. During an overload, void nucleation occurs due to fracture of the Si network and of precipitates. The idea is to use a heat treatment to trigger the diffusion of the healing agents to the cavities. The healing potential of fractured Mg2Si was already proven but the SLM microstructure is different and its influence on the healing efficiency and kinetics needs to be investigated. Nanoholotomography allows observing the same area before and after healing in order to track the damage and to assess the healing potential of the material. As the SLM microstructure will not be noticeable, FIB-SEM will be used to evidence the influence of the microstructure on the healing efficiency.",

Initially, a spectral database of well-defined Pd and Ru compounds will be collected and used as a training set for machine learning. Then, we will step by step increase the complexity of experimental conditions from currently available cells to a reactor that can withstand up to 250\u00b0C and 50 bar, with the possibility to sample the gas phase and carefully dose liquid reactants. Finally, the ML-based system will be implemented and tested allowing for online evaluation of structural and catalytic data and automated refining of the reaction conditions.",

Currently, the macroscopic modulus and strength of concrete are predicted accurately by \u201cmean-field\u201d micromechanics theories and numerical models based on the postulate that each sand particle (aggregate) in the microstructure experiences the same stress state during macroscale loading and is perfectly bonded to the surrounding cement-paste matrix. Recent work by the proposers demonstrates that the aggregates instead experience significant stress variability. Our proposed experiments will exploit combined 3DXRD, scanning 3DXRD and x-ray computed tomography, with digital volume correlation, to quantify stress variability and aggregate-matrix debonding during elastic and inelastic stages of compression in-situ. Results will improve micromechanics theories and provide first-of-its-kind information on aggregate-matrix interface mechanisms previously inaccessible in-situ.",

On the other hand, remagnetization and recrystallization of magnetic phases can occur from the biosynthesis of degraded elements inside cells. We therefore propose a time-comprehensive study by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of the nanoparticles in the cellular environment at different stages of tissue maturation. The electronic structure of Fe and other elements that take part of the nanostructures (Co and Zn) will be probed to track the different phases formed during their degradation or re-biosynthesis inside cells.

    "summary":"Among hydrated borates, inderite and inderborite are two mineralogical species which display a different H2O content (40 wt% in inderborite and 48 wt% in inderite, respectively). In the last years, our team have studied several hydrated borates, each one displaying one (or more) phase transition at high-pressure in the P-range 1.6-14 GPa. The findings suggest a linear correlation between the H2O content and the pressure at which a hydrated borate undergoes a phase transition, but more studies are needed in order to confirm a real trend. \r\nFurthermore, hydrated borates are believed to be a potential aggregate in radiation-shielding concretes due to the large cross section for thermal neutron of the isotope 10B.  A comprehensive characterization of the crystal-chemistry, elastic properties, stability and structural behavior of natural borates at varying T and P conditions is advisable for modelling their behavior as aggregates in radiation-shielding concretes.",

We have previously succeeded in studying the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene on liquid copper at 1370 K (see the previous publications). Meanwhile, growing graphene on liquid catalysts at lower temperatures is of great technical and economic interest. One important candidate is tin, which has a relatively low melting point (505 K) and an exceptionally low vapor pressure. However, tin has very low catalytic activity for graphene growth. Hence, an alloy between tin and a more active metal can provide a compromise between a lower melting point and enough catalytic activity. This proposal aims to grow graphene on a liquid Cu-Sn alloy surface and study the interactions and the atomic structure of the Gr\/Cu-Sn interface using XRR, GIXD, and XRF.

Due to their heterogeneous composition, it is difficult to discriminate the contribution of the various iron sites to the activity and degradation.

It\u2019s relevance for degradation might decrease, when the catalyst is capable of the further reduction of hydrogen peroxide. In this beam time, we will explore the potential induced changes of iron sites at different conditions to identify which iron sites contribute to which step(s) of the ORR mechanism.

    "summary":"Bismuth (Bi)-based catalysts have the potential to produce formic acid  through electrochemical CO2 conversion. The inevitable reconstruction of catalysts under working conditions is unfortunately not well understood, resulting in inaccurate understanding of structure-property relationships. Here, we fabricated two-dimensional Bi oxyhalides electrocatalysts, i.e.BiOBr (BOB)  and BiOCl (BOC). A selectivity (97%) of CO2 to formic acid was obtained with current density up to 156 mA\/cm2 on BOB, whereas BOC displayed a lower selectivity (80%) with current density of 116 mA\/cm2.  In order to elucidate the real active sites, we propose to perform in situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy at the Bi L3 edge. Together with the in situ X-ray diffraction study we have conducted, a link will be built between the different catalytic behavior and the nature of catalytically active sites in the studied catalysts, which would pave the way for the rational design of next-generation electrocatalysts.

Depending on the incorporation type, the cationic\/anionic charge state and occupancy would be modified to neutralize the overall system, leading to distinct changes in the lattice and band structures creating measurable structural and optical signatures. For the doping case it is important to know where the dopant is sitting and how it is helping to reduce the spontaneous strain, which call for systematic local atomic structure and electronic state characterization of Cs and I atom in series of Bi3+ doped CsPbI3 to investigate the underlying operation and phase degradation mechanisms.

A self-healing Al alloy was produced by LPBF using liquid-asssisted healing strategy. The microstructure is composed of high melting point Al cells surrounded by a lower melting point eutectic network. During an overload, void nucleation occurs due to fracture of the eutectic network. The idea is to apply a heat treatment to trigger the melting of the low melting point eutectic phase which can thus flow and fill the voids due to damage. The healing potential of these LPBF Al-Mg alloys was already proven but the mechanical properties of the developed healable Al-Mg alloy are rather low compared to other high strength Al alloys. Alloying elements were thus introduced in the material and their effect on the healing efficiency should be analysed. ",

    "summary":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a versatile class of highly porous crystalline materials, are firmly established as promising performers for applications in catalysis, separations, sensing and more. One of the major challenges in the MOF field is development of scalable, reliable and green synthetic methods to produce high quality MOF materials. Recently reported green ambient temperature syntheses of MOFs in water from metal and ligand salts stand out in their simplicity, rapid nature and industrial attractiveness. However, these methods work only for some MOFs, questioning their broad applicability. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the underlying mechanisms of formation of MOF-74 family materials in aqueous phase in order to shed light on systems\u2019 speciation and processes of nucleation and growth, with larger goals of understanding fundamentals of MOF growth in such systems and developing reliable rapid and green synthetic procedures for numerous MOF families.",

    "summary":"Sodium-ion batteries are attracting much attention for electrochemical energy-storage applications due to the higher abundance and lower cost of sodium\r\ncompared with lithium. Layered transition-metal oxides, in particular NaNiO2 (NNO), hold promise as high-capacity cathode active materials. However, they\r\ntypically suffer from capacity degradation during battery operation. To address this issue, NaNi0.9Ti0.1O2 (NNTO) has been successfully synthesized and found to exhibit significantly improved cycling performance and stability over NNO. This is due in part to benefits of having two active redox couples, namely Ni2+\/Ni3+ and Ni3+\/Ni4+, in NNTO. To correlate the redox chemistry with the electrochemical behavior and to gain insights into the electronic and local structural environments of nickel and titanium, we plan to perform in-situ XAS measurements at the Ni and Ti K-edges.",

While the RDE effect results from an excess of energy deposited by photo- and Auger electrons that are created when X-rays interact with heavy-elements, PDT relies on photosensitizers (PS) that generate cytotoxic species upon light activation. As light penetrates weakly in tissues, PDT is usually limited to superficial tumors. To reach deep tumors, nanoscintillators can be used to locally convert X-rays into visible light and remotely induce PDT. In this project, we will investigate the ability of a nanoscintillator (Lu3Al5O12:Pr) conjugated to a clinically used PS (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) to induce a PDT and RDE effect in vitro in 2D and 3D cultures of pancreatic tumors.",

The OCM develops a gradient\r\nin oxygen potential along the length of the chemical reactor. These varying oxidation potentials have many advantages, such as overcoming the chemical\r\nequilibrium constraints encountered in conventional reactors. We have demonstrated the principle of operation using the water-gas shift reaction and published high-impact publications in Nature Chemistry with ESRF co-authors and in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., ACS Appl. Energy Mater. and ACS Nano. We now seek to extend this work to direct, one-step methane-to-hydrogen production. This could be a breakthrough technology for a future low-carbon fuel economy. This work will involve two strands, (i) controlling the oxygen capacity and chemical potential via doping strategies and materials selection, (ii) producing OCMs with novel properties by harnessing exsolution processes.",

    "summary":"Technological functionality and sensory properties fat-containing food products often depends on the crystallization of the lipids present. Such food products are often suspensions, meaning they contain a dispersed particle phase in a continuous fat matrix. Most often, the dispersed phase is stabilized by a dispersing agent. Both dispersed phase and dispersing agent can influence fat crystallization. In this proposal, the effect of shear on fat crystallization in model suspensions will be investigated. The effect of different shear rates is expected to take place at different length scales (nano- to meso-scale) and thus to be visual both in SAXS and USAXS. Model systems comprising fat, food-grade particles and a dispersing agent will be studied. SAXS will allow to study the fat\u2019s chain length arrangement and crystal nanoplatelet thickness (CNP), while USAXS provides an estimate of the CNP size and the aggregation thereof.",

    "summary":"Ghost imaging works by preparing two copies of a patterned illumination beam. One copy is sent through the specimen and only the total intensity transmitted is recorded, by a point (or bucket) detector. The second copy is measured directly by an array detector (without passing through the sample). The first experimental x-ray ghost imaging was achieved at ID19@ESRF and reported by our team, in a landmark paper in 2016. In subsequent experiments at ID19 we produced 2D, 3D and then phase-contrast x-ray ghost imaging. This proposal takes the topic in a completely new direction: ghost projection.  Rather than recording bucket-signal correlations to image an object, we establish such correlations to create a desired image. We create an arbitrary spatial distribution of intensity by illuminating a single spatially-random screen and transversely scanning it. This proposal aims at realising a 2D ghost projection proof of concept, can be considered as a spatial light modulator for x rays.   ",

    "summary":"Time-resolved X-ray tomography at light sources has experienced rapid development in the last 10 years, evolving from static or quasi-static 3D acquisitions to 3D movies at 200 Hz, as recently demonstrated. The rapid evolution of such techniques results from the improvement of sources, detectors, and reconstruction algorithms. However, the acquisition or rotation process has not been changed and has become a bottleneck to explore faster dynamics. For example, rotations induce shear forces that may alter the studied dynamics and difficult for the sample environment to probe such dynamics. We recently have demonstrated at\r\nESRF X-ray multi-projection imaging (XMPI) that avoids rotating the sample by illuminating it with several X-ray beams. Thus, we will demonstrate imaging of previously inaccessible dynamic processes evolving at timescales that cannot be accessed with currently existing techniques.",

The instrument is being developed by a Swiss, Polish, German and Chinese collaboration. It will perform polarization measurements of photons coming from a range of astrophysical sources. To perform such measurements it is of crucial importance to study the performance of the instrument prior to launch using a dedicated polarized beam. For this, X-rays at different energies from a well-controlled beam are required. The ESRF facility therefore forms the ideal location to verify the POLAR-2 detector concept. Measurements will be performed on the final prototype of POLAR-2 for a range of different energies and instrument configurations in order to gain a full understanding of the detector performance. The results of this study will form the basis of one scientific publication, whereas further lessons learned from this study can still be implemented in the final detector design.",

The presence of these so-called macrozones and associated variability of mechanical properties can lead to premature failure in critical engineering applications. So far, the characterization of 3D local texture can only be tested with destructive methods based on repeated EBSD characterization. \r\nHere we propose to map the local texture in 10 mm^3 sized volumes of two commonly used Ti alloys, known to contain macrozones spanning several hundreds of \u00b5m using the wide angle (WAXS) extension of the tensor tomography methodology, initially established for small angle scattering (SAXS) and bio-materials. Two different reconstruction approaches (hyperspherical harmonics) versus regular sampling of orientation space will be evaluated against each other, and the results will be cross-validated against serial sectionning and EBSD.

    "summary":"The BAG groups 8 teams from 4 Marseille laboratories. Research themes deal with infection, health and biotechnology. For 81 projects within this proposal we foresee 11 MX and 2 SAXS shifts for the next 6 months. This is less of what we had asked for in previous years, given that data collection speed has largely increased and several projects are now being tackled by Cryo-EM. To be added that during the ESRF shutdown all the activities of the BAG have moved to Soleil and the moving back of activities to ESRF is affected by natural inertia. 2 shifts for 6 month at the BIOSAXS beamline, split up in two sessions, suit our needs. Two teams of the BAG combine structural biology with medicinal chemistry and beam time at MASSIF for large ligand-screening campaigns will mostly suit their research purposes. We are grateful to all ESRF staff for always being forthcoming with regard to scheduling, logistics and experiments, allowing the BAG to produce good Science in a comfortable setting.",

In our work on biocatalytic splitting of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons, we analyse in particular the membrane bound [NiFe]hydrogenase, a protein of the remarkable small subgroup of hydrogenases which is active under aerobic conditions. We study the signaling mechanisms of phytochromes by focusing on the structures of photocycle intermediates and analysing domain movements.  We analyse the structures of various G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs; e.g. melanocortin-4 receptor, Ghrelin receptor), either alone or in complex with their cognate G-proteins or selected effector proteins (arrestins), to understand their signaling mechanisms. Other areas of our research include various microbial rhodopsins, cytomegalovirus proteins and their complexes, and DNA photolyases, in particular bacterial (6-4) photolyases.\r\n\r\n",

    "summary":"Structures of large macromolecular machineries were for long time not studied at atomic level as they were often too large for X-ray crystallography and as electron microscopy was not allowing good enough resolution. In the last decade, however, tremendous progress has been achieved in the field of single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which became the method of choice to structurally characterize such large protein complexes. The goal of this BAG is to determine structures of complex and often dynamic protein machineries including multi-subunit complexes, protein-nucleic acid complexes or membrane protein complexes using cryo-EM. The projects aim at determining structures of macromolecular machineries involved in energy conversion and cellular respiration, in nitrate and ammonium metabolism, in ribosome and ribosome-associated functions and in DNA damage repair and maintenance.

The EM demand is therefore extremely high and present in the 4 Institutes. \r\nIn a nutshell, there are 42 PIs that could benefit from Krios time on the EPN campus (more than 90 different samples). Around 20 % of the sample are ready for high resolution data collection with already prepared grids that have been pre-screened on Glacios microscopes. Whereas some work could be carried out on Glacios microscopes, for difficult samples the use of a krios is indispensable (heterogeneous sample or limited concentration requiring a large number of images; small protein etc). Only these samples will be selected for Krios time at the BAG level.\r\n",

This heterocomplex is a fundamental drug-target, however its three-dimensional (3D) structure is still unknown because of the challenges posed by the intrinsic dynamics of the system. To obtain structural information on the heterocomplex assembly in solution we aim to integrate our biophysical data on the complex (obtained by means of NMR, MST, AUC) with SAXS measurements. Molecular details on this heterocomplex will be fundamental for the development of drugs inhibiting this crucial pro-inflammatory complex. ",

The scientific topics are diverse and so different that depicting them in a short Abstract is extremely difficult. In this context BAG members are studying the parameters that govern protein assemblage, structural impacts of signaling processes in different cascades.  There are several projects that are directed towards molecular recognition with implementation towards drug design.   In addition, we still have the ribosome project and the design of unique antibiotics with specific functional interactions from the mycinamycins family and their resistance related mechanism compared with other macrolides and the photosystem and how it converts light into energy. Since Covid-19 is still a relevant topic as are other viral infections BAG members are and have been involved in the understanding of the infection process and the means to hinder it. \r\n",

Central to the research in the BAG associated groups is the employment of integrative methods in structural biology combining X-ray crystallography, SAXS, and cryo-electron microscopy. Many crystals in the various proposed projects are small in size and radiation sensitive, requiring the use of the high brilliance MX beam lines, preferably with micro-focused X-rays.

Fundamental insights obtained into biological processes are often closely coupled to target identification and development of tools, reagents, or inhibitors, which feed into a range of biomedical applications. Our research relies heavily on high quality, reliable and tunable synchrotron radiation, along with state-of-the-art optics, detectors, sample changers, and computation, to support determination of new structures, as well as collect high resolution diffraction data to provide the level of accuracy important in structure-guided drug design.",

This amount of beam time reflects what we had asked for in the previous proposal round. Two teams of the BAG combine structural biology with medicinal chemistry and beam time at MASSIF for large ligand-screening campaigns will mostly suit their research purposes. Access to beamlines with tuneable energy will be instrumental for projects requiring phasing by MAD or MIRAS. One team uses exclusively Bio-SAXS and allocation of one shift\/session would be welcomed. Remote access for MX sessions has become very popular whereas scientists prefer to be on-site for Bio-SAXS experiments.

Only these samples will be selected for Krios time at the BAG level",

We represent a diverse spectrum of research interests, from microbiology, cancer biology, blood disorders, immunology to fundamental biological processes such as membrane transport, DNA repair and mechanisms of enzyme catalysis. Our groups use X-ray crystallography in conjunction with other structural biology, biophysical and biochemical techniques to elucidate molecular mechanisms of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Our cooperation in this block allocation group is mirrored by the consortium of institutions that are stakeholders in the Midlands Regional CryoEM Facility at the University of Leicester.",

We investigate the signalling mechanisms of phytochromes by focusing on the structures of the intermediates of the photocycle and by analysing domain movements or by introducing unnatural amino acids. We analyse the structures of different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; e.g. melanocortin-4 receptor and rhodopsin), either alone or in complex with their cognate G-proteins, to understand their signalling mechanisms. In our work on the biocatalytic splitting of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons, we analyse the membrane-bound and soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases, proteins of the remarkably small subgroup of hydrogenases that are active under aerobic conditions. Other research areas include mechanosensitive channels, microbial rhodopsins, cytomegalovirus proteins  and DNA photolyases.\r\n",

This has allowed us to determine the sequence of events underlying the unique subjacent \u201cVenus flytrap\u201d mechanism. To this aim, we also employed data collected at ESRF C01 under proposal MX-2154. These results have just been accepted for publication.

    "summary":"Since this BAG is composed of seven different working groups from three different locations (university of Cologne, university of Bochum, university of D\u00fcsseldorf), the projects for this proposal are of rather heterogeneous nature. Nonetheless, we are focusing on 5 main topics:\r\n1.) proteins involved in transport processes, transporters or channels, either embedded in the membrane or acting in the cytosol (e.g. ABC transporters, fusion proteins, regulators)\r\n2.) proteins involved in the immune system, pathogen invasion or defense\/resistance processes (dehydratases, toxins, binding proteins)\r\n3.) proteins involved or associated with diseases like cancer or developmental disorders (e.g. protein kinase, toxins, antibodies)\r\n4.) enzymes of putative industrial use to encounter increasing environmental pollution (e.g. transaminases, estereases)\r\n5.) proteins involved in light harvesting, photosynthesis (C3\/C4 pathways) and chromophore binding proteins (e.g. synthases, photosensor domains)\r\n",

    "summary":"The BAG groups 11 teams from 6 Marseille laboratories. It has lately been reorganized, with 2 PIs changing affiliation, and 2 laboratories revisiting internal organisation, but mutual understanding amongst all PIs provides a solid base for efficient organization of the BAG. Research revolves around infection, health and biotechnology. For the next beam time allocation period we could make efficient use of 10 MX and 2 SAXS shifts. This amount of beam time reflects what we had asked for in previous rounds. 3 teams combine structural biology with medicinal chemistry and beam time at MASSIF for large ligand-screening campaigns will mostly suit their purpose. Access to beamlines with tuneable energy will be instrumental for projects requiring experimental phasing. One team uses exclusively Bio-SAXS and allocation of one shift\/session would be welcomed. Remote access for MX sessions has become very popular whereas scientists prefer to be on-site for Bio-SAXS experiments.",

This will be studied by using different protein concentrations and buffer solution conditions, and the interactions between the subunits will be examined in detail. The results obtained in this project will be used to develop detailed models regarding the effect of this amino acid substitution on the dynamic properties within the protein to be solved by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

BioSAXS will be used to probe the self-assembled structure in aqueous solution, via analysis of form factor in dilute solution. This builds on our earlier research on this system, but the new compounds contain novel lipid chains and PEG spacers desgined to both influence the molecular packing and the bioactivity. ",

The applicants are regular users of the MX beamlines at the Swiss Light Source at PSI. As SLS-PSI will close its door in summer 2023 for 2 years, It is now essential for our community to collect data at ESRF. Moreover, the access to the automated MASSIF-1 beamline, managed by Didier Nurizzo and colleagues,  will be an amazing value to our current pipeline. A non exhaustive list of projects by the applicants is presented below. The consortium will need around 14 shifts per 6 months, similar to what they currently are allocated at PSI-SLS. Important note; no application was sent to other synchrotron sources.",

Approval of this BAG will be essential for researchers in all our groups to carry out their structural studies on various health-related and basic research-oriented topics, which are targeted at characterizing large molecular assemblies or proteins currently under-represented in the PDB, including membrane proteins.

    "summary":"Structural biology research groups located in India constitute the INDIA-BAG and will utilize MX, SAXS and CryoEM to study different biological macromolecules.  The non-proprietary agreement signed between ESRF and the Regional Centre for Biotechnology (RCB), on behalf of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) enables studies that provide fundamental  insight regarding different biological processes . About 50 groups are part of this BAG  and the allocated beamtime will be available for over 500 young researchers. A brief description of all the research groups is provided in the global summary. The ESRF-India partnership is supported by a grant provided by the DBT. Please note that a comprehensive annual report has to be sent to the DBT to obtain release of funds to pay ESRF membership dues. Consequently, all the structural biologists from India are grouped in a single BAG to enable smooth allocation of beamtime and monitoring of progress to collect the required statistics. ",

Pannexins are in three isoforms and we seek to study isoform 3 through cryoEM. PANX 3 is the shortest of the three isoforms and displays both calcium and atp release properties. The three isoforms differ in their pore organization and PANX3 displays the widest pore among the three from our earlier structure.

By pioneering in situ X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering experiment for bulk liquids at ESRF it will be possible to explicitly answer whether the hp induces structural reorganization within the HB supramolecular clusters. Additionally, it will be addressed whether the hp-induced changes are gradual or there is any pressure-threshold, after which the structure experiences significant changes. Moreover, whether conformational transformations accompany these changes.

Since cocoa trees only grow in some tropical areas, this increased demand have pushed farmers to convert regions of intact forests into cocoa plantations. Between 2001 and 2014 Ghana lost 175,000 hectares of forest due to cocoa expansion. Such amount of deforestation can have a serious impact on biodiversity and climate change. For this reason, food manufacturers have started to develop strategies to replace or reduce the amount of cocoa used in chocolate. One of them is the use of cocoa butter equivalents, mixtures of triglycerides from multiple sources (e.g., sunflower oil, mango kernel, sal) that resemble cocoa butter in physical and chemical properties. In this project we will investigate the crystallization behaviour of selected CBEs from different origins, and compare it with that of cocoa butter.

We will investigate how model mRNAs and RNPs drive nanostructural changes of cationic LNPs, including the BioNTech\/Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (ALC-0315 and ALC-0159), and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (SM-102 and PEG-DMG).",

    "summary":"In this proposal we aim to understand how the composition of graphite nanoplatelet-based inks for printed flexible conductors affects the ink\u2019s structural response to shear forces during printing by performing rheo-SAXS experiments at ID02. We will investigate the effects of: graphite loading, aspect ratio, and additives on shear-induced structural rearrangements like platelet alignment, which will affect the conductivity of printed conductors. Moreover, we aim to understand the previously observed heat-induced gelation mechanism on a structural level, which is essential for ink spreading behavior on substrates. We have recently investigated the static colloidal properties of our graphite dispersions at ID02 (proposal SC5184) and now would like to focus on the dynamic properties by simulating printing conditions with rheo-SAXS.

    "summary":"Carrageenan and gelatin are biopolymers that may form hydrogels upon cooling. They are commonly used in the food industry as thickening or gelling agents, and more recently in cosmetics and pharmaceutics Here, we present an atypical carrageenan: Kappa\/iota hybrid carrageenan (KI): a linear biopolymers with a random sequence of kappa and iota segment. KI does not display synaereses (expulsion of the solvent) during gelation contrary to classical carrageenan and it is plant based contrary to gelatin. It is therefore well suited industrial application and it will make greener and healthier materials. We aim to study the structural and rheological behaviour of those polymers during the sol-gel transition and to understand the particularity of KI suspensions compared to classical carrageenan and gelatin suspensisons.",

    "summary":"Hybrid perovskite structures are promising materials for inexpensive and efficient solar cells. In particular formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite has shown to be a promising material for single-junction solar cells, reaching a certified power conversion efficiency of over 25%. However, FAPbI3 solar cells face one hurdle on the way to commercialization. The desired black alpha-phase FAPbI3 can spontaneously transform into a photoinactive delta-phase at room temperature. Therefore, the realization of stable and pure phase alpha-FAPbI3 perovskites is of utmost importance. The production method has a huge impact on the crystallization pathway and the quality of the final film. Here we propose a comparative real time study of the three most promising methods: annealing, gas quenching and anti-solvent method. This will give us insight into the different crystallization pathways and how they impact the quality of the resulting film.",
