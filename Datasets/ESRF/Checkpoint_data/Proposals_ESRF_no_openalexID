proposal falls within the general research area of multifunctional multiferroic materials, which has received great attention in both fundamental research\r\nand practical applications. One promising class of multiferroics materials can be realized in the KNi_1-xCo_xPO4 family. In this regard, the origin of the series\r\nof temperature-induced phase transitions high temperatures are also poorly understood. Uncovering the crystal structure is crucial for understanding the\r\nmechanisms behind the magnetoelectric effect in the candidate material. Hence, we propose to use powder x-ray diffraction to determine if the high temperature\r\nphase transitions of the compound at various doping levels (x = 0, 0.1 ,0.2 ,0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0) are accompanied by structural changes.","1":"Having achieved successful results with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), we explore metal-organic and covalent organic polyhedra (MOPs and COPs) for the formation of confined atomically defined solid-state structures within the cavities of the polyhedra by incorporation of main group metal halide (MH) compounds. MH materials are known to exhibit exceptional luminescence and other optoelectronic properties. Single crystals of the MOPs and COPs can be employed as molecular templates for crystallizing MHs within the cavities (by analogy with MOFs). This would enable rational synthesis of desired solids and give access to structures which are not known to form otherwise, and thus further tailoring required optoelectronic properties. We thus anticipate that such molecular templating of the MH crystallization (within MOPs and COPs, as well as metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks) will evolve into an attractive materials design strategy. ","2":"The overall aim of the project is deciphering reaction mechanisms of selected haem- and flavoproteins. These systems are very labile for radiation damage of the redox sites during diffraction data collection, which makes in situ studies using single-crystal UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy inevitable to both prove and trap different redox states and to monitor the potential radiation damage. The project will especially focus on obtaining the true structures of different redox states of the proteins myoglobin and flavodoxin, through a composite and multicrystal data collection approach monitored with spectroscopy.

","5":"Carboranes and their derivatives are extensively used in organic syntheses, medicine, nanoscale engineering, catalysis, metal recovery from radioactive waste, and a number of other areas [1]. The rotation of extremely stable icosahedral clusters of carborane molecule C2B10H12 in these plastic (rotatory) crystals has been intensively studied by various spectroscopic methods but the structural models have been only recently completed by our work at the SNBL. We propose to extend the study to its high pressure part with the aim to characterize the barocaloric effect in these potentially interesting coolers.","6":"Plastic crystals (PCs) are promising materials with piezo-, ferroelectric, magnetic- and barocaloric properties. Recent discoveries of colossal barocaloric effects suggest they could have important applications in solid state cooling. Recently we observed colossal barocaloric properties (\u2265100 J kg-1 K-1) under moderate pressures (<1 kbar) in [(CH3)3(CH2Cl)N]FeCl4 and [(CH3)3(CH2Cl)N]GaCl4. The properties of these materials, along with similar PCs, result from combinations of changes in the long-range structural symmetry and local molecular orientation. But the link between structure and properties is not clear. Thus, here we examine the dynamic structural changes occurring as a function of temperature and pressure to accompany calorimetric measurements and determine the precise chemical-structure mechanisms behind the functional properties. This study will provide vital information for developing effective property engineering strategies.","7":"The aim of the following proposal is to determine crystal structure of natural vermiculite clays of different types using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction, before and after exfoliation into single nanolayers. Vermiculite is a 2:1 layered silicate, composed of 1 nm thin sheets kept together by interlayer cations. The structure of the thin nanolayer is complex, it consists of octahedral sheet sandwiched between the two tetrahedral sheets. \r\nWe have acquired 12 types of vermiculite originating from different areas in the world, and we have managed to exfoliate most of them into the single nanolayers. However, the exfoliation process does not work the same for all of these vermiculite types. As we do not know the exact crystal structure of our vermiculites, we hence cannot estimate the charge of the nanolayers, that will explain the exfoliability of the material.\r\n\r\n\r\n","8":"The current proposal is a continuation of an ongoing project involving two PhD students, where we aim at investigating the crystal structures, and phase transformations in two different material classes: (1) MM\u2019X-type compounds showing a martensitic structural transformation (MST), and (2) FeNi phases showing an ordering transformation to form Tetrataenite. \r\nDuring the recent beamtime 01-02-1229 (June 2021) at SNBL-BM01, we studied several compounds in the (MnNiSi)1-x(Fe2Ge)x system, that were obtained by isostructural alloying and arc melting. Those results are currently still being analyzed. In the current proposal, we plan to expand the studies to (MnNiSi)1-x(Fe2Al)x and (MnNiSi)1-x(FeCuGe)x systems with the aim to reduce the content of Germanium and to establish a magneto-structural coupling around RT. ","9":"Strain in ferroelectric thin films is known to have a pronounced effect on the functional properties of materials. The lead-free ferroelectric SrxBa1-xNb2O6 (SBNx\u00d7100) has a flexible tetragonal tungsten bronze crystal structure which offers the tuning of its functional properties. From earlier beam times a fundamental understanding of the nucleation and growth of SBN thin films prepared by CSD has been reached. We will now conduct pseudo in situ X-ray diffraction studies on pre-made films to identify and quantify the strain in the thin films and the change in crystal structure when exposed to heating around the Curie temperature. For these studies, films with different texture orientations giving both in-plane and out-of-plane polarization, and different thermal histories to induce strain from the substrate will be used. The data will be coupled with ex situ ferroelectric measurements of the thin films to correlate the strain, structural changes, and ferroelectric\r\nproperties.","10":"Silicon-graphite (SiG) electrodes are promising anode candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, there a still technical challenges to overcome for a successful integration into the battery technology. One of them is the formation of electrochemically less reversible phases, which decreases the overall specific capacity. Another challenge is the optimization of Si\/graphite ratio so that the two components participate on the electrochemical (de)-lithiation reactions and that their structures are not affected upon cycling.\r\nThe proposed analyses will serve to develop improved durable SiG composite anodes and to define operating conditions that minimize the occurrence of undesired side reactions.  \r\n","11":"We explore various reticular porous materials, such as metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks and polyhedra as molecular templates for formation of confined atomically defined solid-state structures within the pores by incorporation of main group metal halide (MH) compounds.

The aim of the envisaged experiments is to understand the transformation of the powders when exposed to the conditions they are used in the fabrication of halide perovskite thin-films (i.e. heated under high-vacuum). ","14":"Solid-state batteries based on Li-garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) electrolyte have seen rapid advances in recent years. These systems are poised to address the urgent need for safe, non-flammable, and temperature-tolerant energy storage batteries that concomitantly possess improved energy densities and the cycle life. Moreover, LLZO provides the fundamental basis for the exploration of new cathodes, which have never been envisioned for employment in conventional Li-ion batteries due to solubility issues. In this context, this project proposes a set of experiments that will advance the development of Li-garnet solid-state batteries by focusing on the unexplored family of cathode materials based on Li halogen oxides, LiXOn (X=Cl, Br, I; 1 \u2264 n \u2264 4). The scientific impact of the project is seen as a comprehensive assessment of the chemical and electrochemical compatibility of LLZO with LiXOn using Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction.","15":"We aim to investigate the fundamental mechanism of the conservation of chiral memory during the cyclization reaction of linear dipeptides. Our preliminary\r\nresults showed that the chirality of the product (cyclic peptides) after thermal reaction depended on the absolute configuration (AC) of the residues of the reactant\r\n(linear dipeptides). After the cyclization reaction, the products spontaneously crystallized. This allows i) to refine the AC by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and to\r\nit compare with the configuration of reactants and ii) to investigate in situ the role of the AC of the residue in the morphological changes during the cyclization\r\nreaction using X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy.","16":"The overall aim of the project is deciphering structures and reaction mechanisms of different cofactor proteins.

By comparing the gas adsorption on isostructural MOFs with single metal, bimetallic and physical mixture from the structural point of view we are looking into the\r\n possibility to answer the true phasic nature of the as prepared mixed metal MOF-74 frameworks. Collected data will add to fundamental understanding of gas\r\n adsorption in MOFs and provide practical information on procedures of efficient hydrogen purification and post-combustion CO2 capture by MOF-74 family.","19":"Prussian Blue Analogues are of interest for both fundamental research and practical application; porosity, photo-magnetism, charge transfer phenomena, ionic conductivity, spin state transitions may serve as examples. At variance with other molecular magnets and spin-crossover molecular crystals, for PBAs there are very few cases when the magneto-structural phenomena can be characterized with accuracy and precision of single crystal structural analysis; most of the structural information available so far for PBAs are obtained with powder diffraction methods. We have grown single crystal of KxCoFe(CN)6  that show temperature-induced charge transfer \u2013 spin state transition. We propose here to do full structural study of temperature and light induced switching of the Fe(II)\/Co(III) \u2013 Fe(III)\/Co(II) spin states, aiming at the end to provide, for a first time from single crystal data, estimates of the enthalpy, entropy, and associated kinetic parameters of the spin conversion.

In addition to the molecular structure, the spin-state and temperature dependent spin-state changes shall be elucidated. In addition, intermolecular interactions, e. g. Fe-Fe dimer formation shall be revealed.   We propose to determine the incommensurately modulated structures of the two vanadate fresnoites\r\n\r\nRb2V3O8 and K2V3O8 in superspace. Both compounds have different modulation wave vectors and temperatures of the transition from the normal to the modulated phases. We aim to better understand the underlying mechanisms related to the formation of modulated structures in vanadate fresnoites by performing a full structure determination of both compounds in superspace as a function of temperature.\r\n","21":"Prussian Blue Analogues of the type M3[Co(CN)6]2 is a family of cyanide materials that are extensively studied for hydrogen storage applications. Our preliminary studies show that the last step of sample preparation, namely drying, has a profound effect on the structure. It not only removes the water, but also changes the arrangement of vacancies. For instance, samples dried at 100o C, 150o C and 200o C have drastically different local structure, but the same average structure. In this work we will collect single crystal diffuse scattering datasets to systematically study structural variations of Prussian Blue analogues under various drying conditions: in vacuum, under stream of dry nitrogen, by heating on air at different T, by solvent replacement.","22":"Strain in ferroelectric thin films has a pronounced effect on the functional properties of materials. The lead-free ferroelectric SrxBa1-xNb2O6 (SBN) has a flexible tetragonal tungsten bronze crystal structure which offers the tuning of its functional properties. From earlier beam times a fundamental understanding of the nucleation and growth of SBN thin films prepared by CSD has been reached. We will now conduct in situ X-ray diffraction studies on pre-made films, with different orientations and inherent strain, to identify and quantify the structural changes when exposed to an electrical field and possibly also coupled with heating above the Curie temperature. For these studies, films with both in-plane and out-of-plane polarization, and different induced strains from the substrate will be used. The data will be coupled with ex situ ferroelectric measurements of the thin films to correlate the strain, structural changes, and ferroelectric properties. ","23":"The main objective is to optimize the CO2 uptake capacity in a commercial natural clay, montmorillonite (Mt), to aim for the foundation for rapid technology validation and demonstration in an industrially relevant environment. Recently it was found by the experiment group, that the synthetic clay mineral Ni-Fluorohectorite (Ni-Hec) is competitive with alternative materials (MOFs, activated carbon etc.) regarding CO2 volumetric adsorption capacity. It was also demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption mechanism in Ni-Hec is due to an intercalated nickel hydroxide species, and that Ni-Hec with lower layer charge adsorbs more CO2 at lower pressure. The optimum layer charge of Ni-Hec is like the layer of natural montmorillonite clay (commercial brand name bentonite). The experiment will study prepared Ni-Mt powder samples to investigate if this identified hydroxide mechanism for CO2 capture also can be activated in abundant low-cost natural clays, here Mt.","24":"The aim of the following proposal is to determine kinetics of the process of swelling of natural clay vermiculite, in H2O2, by synchrotron wide-angle X-ray diffraction, upon complete delamination of vermiculite crystal into the single layers. Vermiculite [1-3] is a 2:1 layered silicate, composed of 1 nm thin negatively charged sheets kept together by interlayer cations. We have acquired 15 vermiculite samples originating from different areas in the world, and we exfoliated the most of them into the single nanolayers using H2O2. From our previous XPS experiments and diffraction experiment at BM01 beamline in ESRF, we know that the exfoliation process does not work the same for all of these vermiculite samples, and depends on the type of interlayer cation and charge of the nanosheets. Study of kinetics of reaction promoted by heat, will optimize conditions for exfoliation of vermiculite nanosheets to achieve maximum performance of exfoliation process.\r\n","25":"Layered hybrid perovskites have attracted considerable attention for various optoelectronic applications. However, they remain inferior in optoelectronic devices as compared to their 3D perovskite analogs due to the electronic inactivity of the organic components. The aim of this proposal is to obtain a detailed structural overview of the series of new layered hybrid perovskite materials with enhanced functionalities incorporating electro- and photoactive organic components. We will determine their structures, the contribution of different phases, as well as the corresponding orientation relative to the substrate. Furthermore, we will study their structural properties in response to light. The combined results from X-ray scattering and current-voltage measurements will enable unraveling the critical factors for their operation in functional devices for renewable energy conversion in photovoltaics.","27":"Lithium-ion batteries require components with higher energy density and longer cycle life. SiOx is a promising alternative for high capacity anode materials. However, it suffers from low conductivity and low initial Coulombic efficiency. Considering the high Coulombic of graphite material, some studies found that SiOx\/graphite can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the whole anode. However, SiOx would expand in lithium insertion process, leading to pulverization of the active material, resulting in rapid capacity fade. SiOx volume expansion in SiOx\/graphite anodes can be controlled by adjusting the oxygen content on SiOx, and the effect of SiOx expansion can be successfully followed by investigating induced changes on the graphite structure. This is crucial to quantify the effect of stoichiometry of SiOx oxides on the stability of the anode from early stages and to design functional anodes that can preserve the mechanical properties after prolonged cycling.\r\n","28":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly desired to develop a synthetic chemistry yielding two-dimensional (2D) film with thickness of just a few unit-cells of\r\nstructure. However, realization of 2D MOF films remains elusive to date. The progress in this direction has been limited to the synthesis of layered particles.\r\nWe have recently developed a crystallization strategy that promotes in-plane growth of MOFs (2DZIF, UiO-66-NH2 and UTSA-280) on an epitaxial substrate\r\nforming a unit-cell-thick film. The thickness of the 2DMOF film can be adjusted by simply tuning the growth time under the synthetic conditions.","29":"The loss of intermediate contact between the electrolyte and cathode in solid-state batteries, associated with the significant volume change of cathode materials during cycling, belongs to the key challenges in battery research. To overcome this challenge, we propose to combine two cathodes having opposite chemical expansion coefficients (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 with LiCoO2) in a core-shell like structure. To identify the design parameter (i.e., core diameter, shell thickness), we need to understand how the individual materials behave under electrochemical loads. The aim of this experiment is, therefore, to identify the changes in phases and lattice parameter as a function of the charge\/discharge rate by using operando XRD at BM01. The results will provide unique data on the charge-\/discharge kinetics in this new type of cathode materials by probing the phase evolutions of this different cathode architectures under different rates. ","30":"Both preventive and interventive conservation benefit from the insight gained into the deterioration products and mechanisms of their formations. Beyond conservation, the determination of corrosion products helps for the reconstruction of the original appearances of paintings, metallic and other objects in cultural heritage. This informs art historical, historical, and archaeological investigations among others. The main objective of the intended experiment is the\r\nidentification of the mineralogical phases of the deterioration products in gilded and metallic heritage materials using synchrotron-based high resolution XRD. Prior investigations based on XRF, optical microscopy and SEM-EDS have provided useful information. The elemental composition and imaging must be complemented by molecular and crystal structural techniques. The EBS of the European Synchrotron provides high photon flux and lateral resolution for sensitive mineralogical determinations on micro-samples using HRPD.\r\n","31":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials that are composed of metal ions connected with organic ligands leading to an ordered pore topology. Recently, we have developed a novel technique utilizing epitaxial substrates which promote in-plane nucleation and growth of 2D zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) and succeeded in solving the structure of our 2DZIF film, which is different from its known 3D analog. We have extended the crystallization strategy to other promising MOFs (UiO-66-NH2, ZIF-7, CALF-20, MIL-53, MIL-101). Owing to the fact that MOFs are not stable under electron beam, we could not get the comprehensive understanding of 2D MOF structure including the in-plane and out-plane information. In particular, we are very interested in solving their crystal structure to understand the similarities and differences of the structure of 2D films and their 3D analog, and the correlation between orientation of 2D films and their underlying substrates.","32":"The purpose of this proposal is to use Powder X-ray Diffraction to investigate the addition of alloying elements and cryomilling on the formation of the tetrataenite phase in FeNi-based alloys produced by different processing routes.

The aim of the experiment is to investigate the structural response of CALF-20 towards relevant adsorptives.","34":"Previously our group found, that the synthetic clay mineral Ni-Fluorohectorite (Ni-Hec, where Ni2+ is the charge-compensating cation in the clay interlayer) is competitive with alternative materials (MOFs, activated carbon etc.) with respect to CO2 volumetric adsorption capacity. It was also recently demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption mechanism in Ni-Hec is due to an intercalated nickel hydroxide species, and that Ni-Hec with lower charge layer adsorbs more CO2 and at lower pressure compared to higher layer charges.  Recently we in addition found that Fe3+ or Fe2+ (instead of Ni2+) demonstrate CO2 interaction similar to Ni-Hec. In this proposed experiment we want to do a detailed temperature-pressure study of Fe-Hec powders. Fe is particularly interesting here because it is much more abundant and available than Ni and has much less environmental concerns. The experiment will study prepared Fe-Mt powder samples.","35":"SiOx is one of the most promising materials to increase the capacity of anodes for next-generation Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs), with theoretical storage\r\n capacities of up to 2400 mAhg-1. However, the stability and storage capacity of SiOx anodes depends on its oxygen content, and therefore the development\r\n of synthesis routes for the controlled synthesis of SiOx compounds with tailored oxygen content is imperative. MagnesioThermic reduction (MgTR) has been\r\n pinpointed as a scalable method to produce SiOx from Mg and SiO2 using much lower temperatures (500-950\u00baC) than conventional methods. However, synthesis\r\n temperature, reaction time and stoichiometry of the reactants strongly affect reaction pathways and prevents the controlled synthesis of SiOx compounds with\r\n adjusted oxygen content. Hence, in situ analysis of the MgTR via X-ray diffraction is critical to design an effective strategy for the synthesis of high-performance\r\n SiOx electrodes for LIBs.","36":"We explore various reticular porous materials, such as metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks and polyhedra as molecular templates for formation of confined atomically defined nano-sized solid-state structures within the pores by incorporation of main group metal halide (MH) compounds. MH materials are known to exhibit exceptional luminescence and other optoelectronic properties. Single crystals of the porous materials can be employed as molecular templates for crystallizing MHs within the cavities. In this way, geometry, functionality, electric charge and topology of the pores determines the structure of resulting MH nano-sized units, what might enable rational synthesis of desired solids and gives access to structures which are not known to form otherwise, and thus further tailoring optoelectronic properties. Our current work focuses on explorations of various frameworks and polyhedra and MHs as hosts and guests, respectively, offering vast compositional and structural space.","37":"We plan to measure in-situ liquid-solid and solid-solid phase transitions in Fe-Si-C-alloys in the proposed experiment.  One objective is to determine the undercooling for \u03b3-Fe and graphite nucleation as a function of alloy composition and inoculation by ceramic microparticles, previously evaluated in SEM and TEM (see Figure 1). Also, the kinetics of the eutectic and eutectoid transitions will be recorded at fixed cooling rates as a function of crystallographic change: amorphous to \u03b3-Fe in the eutectic (~1150 \u00b0C), and \u03b3-Fe to \u03b1-Fe (~800 \u00b0C) in the eutectoid.\r\n\r\n","39":"Solid sorbets for CO2 capture applications are a technological pathway to prevent CO2 emissions from being released to the atmosphere and are therefore a key strategy to mitigate global warming.  In this work, we aim to explore the reaction dynamics of high-temperature CO2 capture of the recently proposed high-capacity CO2 sorbent Li3BO3, which displays remarkably fast kinetics together with high CO2 capacity and excellent regenerability, which are also significantly enhanced by the addition of alkali fluorides. By performing in situ X-ray diffraction studies under different CO2 partial pressures and temperatures we aim to unveil the reaction mechanisms of L3BiO3 and Na- and K- modified Li3BO3 solid sorbents under relevant operational conditions and provide solid grounds for the design of performance-optimized Li3BiO3-based sorbents.","40":"The goal of the present experiments is to use the high-resolution XRD at BM01 to study the smallest modifications ever created by ultrashort pulsed IR laser processing of monocrystalline silicon and ZnS crystals. The dependence of the size, exact position, defects' form, and structural properties on specific laser irradiation parameters will be investigated. The laser processing influence on sample properties such as crystal orientation, doping type, doping level, dislocations, and strain will be investigated. Aside from understanding the physical nature of these modifications, the immediate impact of this investigation will be to establish the optimal laser processing conditions for achieving the phase transition in the material, thus enabling the creation in a controllable way of sub-wavelength (nanometer scale) modifications in semiconductor structures based on Si, ZnS, Cr:ZnS and in various heterostructures based on Si and II-VI compounds.","42":"Substituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a highly prospective material for application as a solid electrolyte in solid-state batteries due its high Li-ion conductivity. With Al3+ a cubic Ia-3d garnet structure is stabilized, small amounts of Ga3+ or Fe3+ stabilize an I-43d structure. Ga-LLZO and Fe-LLZO show phase transitions between 280\u2013350\u00b0C in fresh and aged material. The existence and the nature of these phase transitions has not been reported in literature of LLZO so far (hardy to observe with powder data) and we propose to investigate it in detail using single-crystalline material in an in-situ high-temperature synchrotron-diffraction study. Pure LLZO is tetragonal and transforms to the Ia-3d structure at Tc ~ 645\u00b0C, in aged material a more complex transformation series is reported, which also needs a more detailed study to explain its nature. Also, for pure LLZO, no detailed structural information on phase transition behaviour is available for this technological relevant material.","43":"The proposal is focused on exploring the behaviour of carbonaceous material for fabrication of anodes for Li-ion batteries. The intended aim is to study the structure evolution of the porous, activated carbon when exposed to a binder or different binders, to explore how the pores change after exposure. The interaction with the binder can reduce the electrolyte-accessible pores, affecting the obtainable capacitance from ion adsorption\/desorption. We plan to do SAXS  experiment to reconstruct pore size and shape after exposure to different binders. This will bring us knowledge about which binder to use in order to the best performance of the anode.","44":"Some metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations during removal or exchange of the guest molecules in the pores. Crystal structure determination of such samples is a powerful technique to elucidate the host-guest properties of the MOF. Typically, adsorption sites or configurational changes in network arrangement are identified in this fashion. Cases where the constitution of the network changes are rarer. In this experiment, we will follow the desolvation and dehydration of a zinc-organic framework that completely changes the constitution of the inorganic secondary building unit (SBU).","45":"We explore various reticular porous materials, such as metal-organic and covalent organic frameworks and polyhedra as molecular templates for formation of confined atomically defined nano-sized solid-state structures within the pores by incorporation of main group metal halide (MH) and pseudohalides.

These solid-state systems are poised to address the urgent need for safe, non-flammable, and temperature-tolerant energy storage batteries that concomitantly possess improved energy density and cycle life as compared to conventional liquid-electrolyte-based counterparts. In this project, ASSLB based on Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP, x = 0.3 \u2013 0.5) solid-state electrolytes are fabricated in the shape of a thin membrane. LiCoO2 (LCO), as high voltage cathode materials, is co-sintered together with LATP as a composite cathode and forms one-body batteries with an extra LATP layer. The project is motivated by its all ceramics properties with a safe and high energy density structure. The sintering process and the electrochemical phase change during cell cycling will be carefully studied by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD).","47":"Ab-initio phonon calculations rely on the harmonic approximation to estimate atomic forces and phonon dispersion relations at low temperatures, but this approximation fails in the case of thermoelectric materials. These discrepancies are due to insufficient incorporation of temperature effects, such as lattice expansion, anharmonicity. These parameters are temperature-dependent and it is necessary to benchmark anharmonic ab-initio calculations that include lattice expansion to crystallographically simple systems, as we are currently pursuing with SrTiO3 (STO), Mg2Si and GeBi2Te4 (GBT). Our initial results from neutron scatterings show that the calculations using sTDEP method are not too far from the experimental results, but that fine tuning is necessary. This can be achieved by including in the calculations the experimental thermal lattice expansion parameters extracted from single crystal XRD for a large temperature range, namely 100 K to 600 K. ","48":"Alloying anode materials for metal-ion batteries provide higher capacity than traditional intercalation materials, at the cost of cycle stability. Many parameters can affect their lifetime and performance in a battery, including particle size and size of the pores in the electrode. With increasing particle size, diffusion limits the progress of chemical reactions. Larger pore size can improve ion diffusion at a cost of lower energy density. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a tool to investigate nanostructural changes occurring in a short range, which are complementary to the atomic scale, long range information obtained with wide-angle Xray scattering (WAXS). We will study the changes in porosity and particle size for Sn, Sb and Bi anode materials during cycling in Na-ion batteries. By measuring these parameters during battery operation, we aim to get a better understanding of morphological changes during cycling, and find the optimal balance between porosity and particle size.","49":"Thermomaterials are compounds with substantial thermal changes associated with solid-to-solid phase transitions. These materials could play an important role in environmentally friendly alternative refrigerants and thermal energy storage. Decoding the structural origins of the high entropy solid-solid phase transitions is an ongoing challenge of the field. Promising thermomaterials are those based on long chain alkylammonium halide salts, due to their large, reversible phase transition near ambient temperature. This proposal will examine key materials, (C10H21NH3)Cl, (C10H21NH3)(BF4) etc., by conducting single crystal and powder synchrotron-based diffraction measurements in situ with variable temperature and pressure. We will combine this data with thermodynamic parameters obtained from variable temperature and variable pressure differential scanning calorimetry. These studies will offer essential insights on the key structure mechanisms that underpin the solid-solid transitions.\r\n\r\n","50":"Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently considered as the most promising and advanced energy storage\r\ntechnology. However, a few scientific challenges in LIBs remain. That includes a fundamental understanding\r\nof degradation processes in active materials in LIBs and how these processes affect the performance of a\r\nbattery. It is clear that a large number of LIBs will be produced in the nearest future, making recycling an\r\nimportant process for sustainable and responsible production. However, recycling cannot be performed\r\nwithout a clear understanding of the degradation processes occurring in the cell during electrochemical\r\ncycling. We will study NCM and LFP-based cathodes at different stages of their lifetime.

We have recently discovered that under low-pressure operating conditions, this reaction can exhibit pronounced kinetic oscillations during the initiation period - a phenomenon never before seen in zeolite materials during half a century of their intense investigations in both academia and industry. Here, we propose an in situ X-Ray diffraction experiment to monitor the temporal evolution of the zeolite unit cell parameters and electron density within the micro pores during the oscillations. Such data will help us in elucidating the underlying mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, which are presently unknown. For example, we will be able to test whether coherent framework deformations control the observed periodic release of hydrocarbon products form the zeolite.","53":"Pt\/Si is a substrate of interest for the selective deposition of oxides from aqueous solution due to it's compatibility with thiol-based SAMs for patterning. BTO\r\nis a good example oxide because its deposition using aqueous CSD is well studied. Previous measurements performed at ESRF have indicated that the Pt\/Si\r\nsubstrate may stabilise unwanted oxycarbonate phases during the annealing of BTO. To optimise the deposition of BTO on Pt\/Si, we will study the annealing\r\nprocess in BTO films prepared by aqueous CSD, as well as the influence of the annealing process on the ferroelectric properties of the films. We will perform in\r\nsitu X-ray diffraction measurements during the pyrolysis and annealing process to investigate the nucleation, growth, and decomposition of crystal phases in the\r\nfilm.

We propose the in-situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study of CO2 uptake by the novel ultra-microporous heterometallic Cu-based MOF. The chains of the latter coordinate water, which upon the activation (above 230 C) create active open metal sites capable to attract CO2 at relatively low pressures with a total uptake comparable with some of the benchmark MOFs reported to date. The PXRD will allow to investigate the crystal structure response\/flexibility of MIP-212(Al-Cu) to the CO2 loading which will help us to model the sorption mechanism using the computational methods.","58":"In this experiment, we aim to study formation of sandwich of heteroatom doped graphene inside the confined space of layered silicate. In our previous experiments, we grew heterostructure of alternating layers of graphene and clay, now we aim to optimize preparation of sandwich structure of graphene and clay.

These materials have a complex structure resulting from the coexistence of graphene sheets restacked in graphite-like arrangement and graphene sheets spaced out using a molecular pillar controlling the inter-sheet distance and providing valuable electrolytic ions adsorption site. With the aim of identifying and understanding the adsorption mechanisms at play in the charge\/discharge stages it is essential to follow the evolution of both the structure and the porosity upon polarization and cycling. However, such operando investigations necessitate synchrotron beam. Indeed, compared to batteries, SCs have much faster cycling kinetics which are incompatible with the typical required counting times of lab diffractometers.

Since the variation in\r\nscattering will mainly come from either the Co or the Ta, we will be able to reconstruct with precision the in-depth stack of material and identify\r\nthe driving mechanism, such as element migration and so on, during the different stage of the material process.","67":"The water content in starchy substrates impacts their formulation, properties, processing and aging. In particular, the structural characteristics of native starch granules at different lengthscales (lamellar repeat and degree of crystallinity) are generally determined after a several-day equilibration of starch powders (a few hundred milligrams) at controlled relative humidity. Our experiments aim at shedding light on the hydration dynamics by monitoring the structural changes over the course of a few hours, as a function of the amylose\/amylopectin ratio and allomorphic type of the granules, to rationalize the equilibration process. Moreover, by simultaneously collecting time-resolved WAXS and SAXS data, we will assess the correlation between the long-range lamellar order and short-range crystal structure in the starch granules upon hydration.","69":"The objective of this proposal, as well as its originality, is to study strain induced crystallization (by WAXS) and cavitation damages (by SAXS)\r\nassociated of a specific elastomer having chemical modifications (especially chain scissions) due to an oxidative degradation process. A\r\nspecific sulphur-crosslinked polyisoprene has been chosen as a model elastomer with and without reinforcing fillers. As expected, the fillers\r\n(carbon black) promote damage mechanisms such as cavitation detected by SAXS. We plan to acquire WAXS and SAXS data during in situ\r\ntensile tests on two series (12 states of degradation) of the same elastomer with and without 60% vol. reinforcing fillers.","70":"Calcium sulfate minerals (i.e. gypsum, anhydrite and bassanite) are ubiquitous on Earth and they are highly relevant chemical compounds for a wide variety of industrial processes. The current consensus based on state-of-the-art synchrotron and electron microscopy data, is that the formation of crystalline phases in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical involving several steps, including an intermediate amorphous\r\nphase. The overarching issue that remains to be resolved is whether all three phases of CaSO4, and in particular gypsum and bassanite,\r\nfollow the same non-classical pathway entailing a common precursor amorphous phase? With this proposal we aim to use SAXS\/WAXS to\r\nfollow in situ and in a time-resolved manner the evolution of species forming from aqueous solutions containing calcium and sulfate ions. We propose an experiment in which bassanite or gypsum are formed selectively under directly comparable, thermodynamic conditionsdiffering only slightly in temperature. ","71":"It is know well known that the structural evolution of a thermoplastic polymer upon stretching is closely linked with the stretching conditions (i.e. stretching\r\ntemperature and speed). Former studies carried out by our group have shown that the nature of the strain-induced phase (i.e. cristalline, mesomorphic...) is\r\nalso related to the macromolecular dynamics into the material and that relationships exist between these characteristic relaxation times, the nature of the strain-induced phase and the stretching conditions. However, up to now the determination of the macromolecular dynamics, in situ upon stretching, remains a challenge. The goal of this work is thus to measure the influence of orientation on the macromolecular dynamics of a polymer upon stretching, in situ, using the XPCS technique (which is one of the few allowing such measurements) in order to definitely confirm the relationships existing between the macromolecular dynamics and the nature of the strain induced-phase","72":"Our project is based on the SAXS\/WAXS study of the structural evolution of polymers during a swelling kinetic by scCO2 in order to follow\r\nsimultaneously during the swelling, the relaxation and the crystallinity (when present) by WAXS and the large scale structure by SAXS with\r\npolymers of industrial interest. We will focus our study on polymer families with major industrial interest namely a polyethylene (PE), a polycarbonate (PC) and a polyamide (PA12) and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) known to swell rapidly and commonly used in industry (e.g.\r\nencapsulation of solar panels). The objectives are to characterize the swelling kinetics, to understand the origin of the structural reorganization\r\nat the origin of the CO2 desorption after a latency period and to determine if a general behavior can be observed comparing different types of\r\npolymers. The underlying question is: Is there a common mechanism or the different behaviors may have different physical origins?","73":"Seeds transformation for human nutrition results to the production of large amounts of co-products which contain various polymers with highly\r\ninteresting functionalities. Among them, feruloylated arabinoxylans (AXf), are able to form covalent hydrogels by oxidation of their ferulic acid\r\nunits. These hydrogels have a huge swelling capacity, which makes them powerful encapsulation matrices. However, due to high AXf\r\nviscosity, strong gels were until now difficult to product. Since AXf bind efficiently to cellulose surfaces, we investigated AXf \/cellulose\r\nnanocrystals (CNC) gels. Previous results showed these composites gels to have higher mechanical properties and even larger mechanical\r\nresistance after a lyophilisation\/ hydration cycle. Inversely, swelling capacity of regenerated gels decreased. Characterisation of the multiscale\r\nstructure of AXf\/CNC hydrogels during their swelling is necessary to determine which molecular interactions govern it.","74":"Blends of natural rubber (NR) and crosslinked poly(butadiene) (BR) are an important class of polymers widely used in automotive\/tire industry due to their specific mechanical performance. The aim of this project is to selectively study the crosslinking phenomenon for each component of these blends (NR & BR) and its influence on the mechanical behaviour. Particularly the goal of this project is to determine, for the first time, the influence of the crosslinking density of each phase of the blend on the mechanical response during uniaxial stretching of the material. To achieve this goal, the structural evolution of the materials will be followed by means of simultaneous SAXS-WAXS experiments upon uniaxial stretching in order to determine the influence of the crosslinking density of each phase on the resulting mechanical behaviour. Also, the influence of the BR phase, which remain amorphous when the blend is deformed, on the crystallization of NR under stress will be studied in detail.","75":"Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, has a tightly packed crystalline structure stabilized by van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. This limits its solubility in most common solvents and its industrial applications. A better understanding of cellulose-solvent interactions is vital to improve the processability of cellulose. Inorganic molten salt hydrates such as ZnCl2 hydrates and LiSCN hydrates are a class of cellulose solvents that recently attracted increasing scientific attention due to their nontoxicity, low cost, and recyclability. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the crystal structure of cellulose\/ZnCl2 complex and the molecular interactions between cellulose and ZnCl2 hydrates using in-situ small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (S\/WAXS) technique. Such knowledge will lay a foundation for understanding and optimizing the swelling and dissolution of cellulose in molten salt hydrates for industrial applications.","76":"We propose a new route to toughen epoxy thermosets from reactive block copolymer (BCP) dispersion masterbatches. Our approach relies on i) the controlled in situ formation and self-assembly of AB block copolymers (with an A core-forming rubbery block for mechanical energy dissipation and a B block ensuring stabilization of the self-assemblies) into a range of spherical, vesicular and most-desired worm-like morphologies by RAFT polymerization induced self-assembly (PISA) in epoxy monomers and ii) the subsequent polymerization of the epoxy monomers. In this context, we aim at i) establishing phase diagrams of the reactive dispersions as a function of solid content (10 to 40 wt %), molar mass of both blocks and their relative compositions to secure access to the most-desired higher-order morphologies in the epoxy monomer and ii) investigating the fate of these morphologies while curing the thermoset (dilution with the epoxy monomer and\/or the hardener, heating cycles triggering curing).","77":"While the mixture of lidocaine and decanoic acid is a deep eutectic solvent (DES), the ternary mixture of these two compounds with water presents a complex phase\ndiagram in which several regions can be exploited for liquid phase extraction. We here aim at characterizing the structural organization (micelle or cluster formation,\ncorrelation lengths, aggregation) over a large part of the phase diagram, including the DES, in order to understand the mechanisms leading to the phase separation.\nWe propose to use a home-built cell for in-situ dilution and efficient phase diagram characterization. We request for this purpose 9 shifts on D2AM.","78":"Aluminum titanate polycrystalline materials are commonly used at an industrial scale for various applications. The intrinsic properties of b-\r\nAl2TiO5 is strongly anisotropic and not easy to determine. Nevertheless, quite recent works, on single crystals or polycrystalline bulk or\r\npowdered materials, allow access more or less to the variation as a function of the temperature of some of these intrinsic properties. During\r\nthis experiment, we expect to get data allowing us to understand the role of the microstructure on the actual properties of aluminum titanate dense\r\npolycrystals.","79":"An original method of compliant epitaxy, known as Nano-Pendeo Epitaxy, has been developed for achieving low dislocation density GaN and\r\nmanaging the strain into the nitride layers. Initial thin AlN and GaN layers are grown on silicon on insulator (SOI) layers, before being patterned into nanopillars. The degrees of freedom in rotation acquired by the nano-pillars allows the crystallites to align crystallographically at the time of coalescence, therefore without creating defects. This alignment is explained by a reduction of interface energy between adjacent crystallites slightly misorientated before coalescence. To go further quantitatively in the understanding of the crystallite alignment mechanisms at work and feed our numerical simulations, we would like to follow before and after coalescence of the nano-pyramids, the average evolution of the mosaicity and twist within a vignette of nano-pillars.","80":"The aim is to perform coupled X-ray fluorescence\/diffraction computed tomography (XRF\/XRD-CT) to investigate medieval\r\nadornments called \"applied brocades\". Previous works have highlighted singular layer superimpositions and specific trends in the making of\r\nthese sophisticated decors, which could be characteristic of a know-how specific to the Duchy of Savoy. We now need to extend the corpus by\r\nstudying well selected micro-fragments taken on sculptures and mural painting. We want to investigate the overall sequence of the stratigraphy\r\nand specifically the nature of the gilding and the tin degradation products. For this, we will make the 3D mapping of the elements\/phases with a\r\nprobe size adapted to the quite large dimension of the fragments, sampled so as to preserve the entire stratigraphy. The D2AM beam line with\r\na 25 keV beam focused to about 20 x 20 \u03bcm2 and with a 2D detector to collect diffraction patterns in a short time is ideally suited for this\r\nexperiment.","81":"Recently, the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has generated a great excitement, as their properties are\r\nbelieved to be related to the NiO2 plane, which are considered to be equivalent to the CuO2 planes in cuprate high-Tc superconductors (HTS).\r\nRecently it has been shown that infinite layer nickelates exhibit peculiar magnetic excitations with a bandwidth of circa 200 meV in SrTiO3-\r\ncapped infinite-layer nickelate thin films. The magnetic mode is softening upon Sr-doping. During a previous high-resolution RIXS experiment\r\nat ID32 beam-line of ESRF [proposal HC-4628] we could reproduce such a result on our SrTiO3-capped samples. Here we would like to\r\nascertain if such spin excitations are giving rise to a long-range magnetic order and, understand, the possible connection with the\r\nsuperconducting state.","82":"In the proposed experiment, we aim to detect and characterise ferroelectric phase transitions in tensile strained NaNbO3 thin films at low\r\ntemperatures down to 20 K and to structurally investigate the corresponding phases in more detail. The influence of tensile stress on the\r\nphase transition will be investigated in more detail using two samples grown on two different substrates. For this purpose, in situ 3D X-ray\r\ndiffraction and grazing incidence in-plane diffraction will be used.","83":"Accumulative roll bonding (ARB) of metal-metal nanolaminates (NL) is a very promising approaches to fabricate metallic nanomaterials with\r\nexcellent strength and good ductility. Interface resistance to dislocation transmission is believed to be one of the important mechanisms\r\nresponsible for these unique properties, but many open questions remain. In recent micro-beam bending and nanoindentation experiments on\r\nFCC\/BCC Cu\/Nb NLs we have shown an anisotropic sliding behavior linked to the strong in-plane texture originating from the ARB process\r\nand consistent with MD simulation. The aim of the present experiment is to follow in situ the local stresses and plastic events in Cu\/Nb\r\nnanolaminates during tensile loading. While previous rare tensile testing experiments have been reported the in situ monitoring of local strain\r\nby X-ray Diffraction (XRD) has never been performed. This experiment is a continuation of HC-4460, which was dedicated to in situ shearing\r\nof interfaces in ARB NLs.","84":"For potential new applications in photovoltaic, it is crucial to maintain the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) on flexible substrates. The\r\nbehavior of organic materials and stackings under stress (evolution of structure, strain, cracks,...) needs therefore to be\r\ncarefully addressed. Our objective is to come to a better understanding of the relationship between the evolution of crystallinity and the\r\nmechanical behavior of semi-conducting polymer thin layers and stackings of OSC layers during mechanical loading. The structural properties\r\nof the individual photoactive materials as well as their properties when incorporated in a device stack i.e. surrounded by extraction layers, will\r\nbe investigated by in situ Grazing Incidence XRD under applied uniaxial tensile stretching. This will allow a detailed understanding of the\r\ninfluence of materials fabrication, use of different extraction layers and nature of substrate on the mechanical strength of these organic layers.","85":"We propose to measure phason modes in the i-AlCuRu quasicrystal using diffuse scattering on an absolute scale.

We recently performed at D2AM beam-line resonant X-ray diffraction experiments\r\nat the Ni K-edge in very grazing conditions, to get the first insight into the magnetic structure of infinite layer nickelate thin films. Our first series\r\nof experiments were devoted to find important signature of long-range magnetic order, and our results, although very promising, are not\r\nenough to obtain a solid conclusion. Therefore, we aim at continuing those experiments benchmarking the set-up also for perovskite NdNiO3\r\nthin films which show a very well know long-range AFM order below 180 K when properly grown on top of SrTiO3 single crystals.","87":"The description of structural and electronic properties at the electrochemical interface is of primary importance for the comprehension of the electro-catalytic mechanisms, a challenging topic for the understanding of the electrochemical reactivity. While surface scattering has become a standard X-Ray technique for the surface atomic structure description, up to now no experimental method allowed obtaining the charge distribution of the catalyst surface and in the electrolyte in the interfacial region.\r\nWe recently could demonstrate that, combining in situ Surface Resonant X-Ray Diffraction (SRXRD) experiments and ab initio DFT calculations, it is possible to access the interfacial charge distribution. In order to further develop the potential of our original approach, we now want to investigate the CO adsorption on Pt(111). CO\/Pt(111\u00b0) represents a challenging system for the use of Pt as a catalyst in fuel cells, due to the known poisoning problems.","88":"We plan to study the high temperature evolution of a direct bonding interface between Silicon Carbide materials.

We shall measure the\r\nsealing of the gap and the broadening of the interfaces. Crystal scattering will be also followed to monitor the strain in the layers close to the\r\ninterface.","89":"Nickel silicide, Ni(Pt)Si thin film plays an important role in reducing contact resistance and facilitating current flow in microelectronics devices. For advanced\r\nmicroelectronics technology, ultra-thin Ni(Pt)Si film (below 20 nm) is the primary choice of materials to be used as contacts on the active regions of the Si-based\r\ntransistors. However, Ni(Pt)Si thin film suffers from poor morphological stability due to the agglomeration phenomenon at a temperature as low as 500 \u00b0C. The\r\nbreakage of thin film by agglomeration leads to the formation of inverted small islands of Ni(Pt)Si. This results in a drastic increase of sheet resistance, Rs,\r\ndetrimental to the overall yield and performance of devices (fig. 1). Detavernier et al. has shown the importance of the texture of Ni(Pt)Si films in controlling the\r\nagglomeration phenomenon. In particular, the axiotaxy (off-normal fibre texture, fig. 2) was found to play an important role in agglomeration.","90":"We aim to investigate the structural properties of new blend active layers with polymer acceptors composing stretchable organic solar cells, as well as the impact of intermediate layers and electrodes on the mechanical behavior of the whole stacks.

The structural properties of the individual materials as well as their properties when incorporated in a device stack will be investigated by in situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction under applied uniaxial tensile stretching. The structural behavior will be linked to the electronic properties of the layers and the entire cell, in order to figure out more stretch-resilient flexible devices","91":"We propose to study in situ at the quantitative level the spinel and mullite crystallization processes inside bulk refractory ceramics and the\r\ninfluence of the kind of alumina particles used on their reactivity under solid state at high temperature.","92":"We are interested in the study of structure\/function relationships of nickel enzymes, nickel proteins and nickel protein-based artificial metalloenzymes.

However, despite the numerous associations of GSTs with stress responses, cell development and metabolism, the functions of these enzymes remain usually evasive mainly due to their high diversity and also to the lack of knowledge about their catalytic specificities. For about ten years, we have been interested in GST structurefunction relationships. This project is a continuation of these studies including a team from CSGA (UB, CNRS, INRAE, Dijon) and a team from CRM2 (UL, CNRS, Nancy). B) Bacteria evolve mainly through horizontal gene transfers, where conjugation plays a key role.

To address this question we analyze the properties of resurrected ancestral enzymes engaged in a thermal adaptation route we recapitulated. We will solve the crystal structure several billions-years old enzymes and we will explore their dynamical properties following X-rays data collection at various temperature.

One of our primary focus is on solving the 3D structures of enzymes within the MEP pathway, as they represent promising drug targets. Additionally, we are engaged in characterizing new fluorescent proteins derived for instance from bacteriophytochrome. Our research activities also include the development of instrumentation and methodologies, spanning from crystallization to room temperature data collection. We strive to enhance crystal quality for both X-ray and neutron diffraction. Furthermore, we conduct high-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries to identify active ligands targeting proteins with pharmaceutical relevance.","118":"mEmerald is a GFP-derived fluorescent protein that showed a tendency to reversibly photoswitch between an \"on\" fluorescent state and an \"off\" non-fluorescent state under cryogenic conditions. It has been used to this purpose in super-resolution PALM imaging. Usually, reversibly switchable fluorecent proteins (RSFPs) photoswitch via the ci-trans isomerization of their chromophore. Such major reorganizations are prevented by cryogenic conditions and the efficient roomtemperature photoswitching of most of the existing RSFPs is abolished at low temperatures. mEmerald seems to be one of the rare exceptions but its photophysical mechanism remains to be elucidated. After having solved the high resolution 3D structure of the initial green-emiting form of the protein, I would like to solve the structure of photoswitched form at cryogenic temperature (100K), and correlate this structure with the corresponding absorption and\/or emission spectra either measured offline or, if possible, online.","119":"Human Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a well known scavenger of organophosphorous nerve agents. It is also a recent target for development of the so-called reactivators, highly nucleophilic compounds, able to restore enzyme activy after nerve agents inhibition. In parallel, BChE is also a new target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Determination of crystal structure of BChE in complex with compounds designed to act as anti-AD drugs, will well to improve our structural database, in order to designed better and BChE-specific reactivators.","120":"Hollandites are quite common oxides widespread in several geological settings; they are among the most common Mn minerals in soils, where they play a key role in a variety of cation-exchange reactions, and in Mn dendrites observed on rock surfaces and fractures. From a structural point of view, hollandites belong to the tunnel oxides and are characterized by channels partially occupied by large di- or mono-valent cations (Ba, Pb, K, Na) delimited by 2\u00d72 octahedral walls. \r\nA lowering of symmetry is often observed, possibly related to framework distortions or ordering of cations and vacancies within the tunnels.\r\nOur aim is to investigate the local environment of tunnel cations in hollandite and assess the relationship between the disorder in their position and the nature and oxidation state of octahedral cations. \r\n","121":"This proposal aims to monitor the Fe and Hg complexes resulting from the use of ferrate in Hg contaminated water, working with a 500 ppb Hg lab solution and real samples collected from the Abbadia San Salvatore (ASS) former Hg-mining area (Italy). The main goal is the X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) investigation of the solid precipitates resulting from the direct application to the samples of Fe(III) and Fe(VI) based reagents, the latter being synthesized through an original procedure. Preliminary tests have already been performed during low beam current in-house shifts. The information acquired will provide an insight to how firmly Hg is \u201ccaptured\u201d and the potential for its remobilization.","123":"High entropy oxides are one the most interesting new groups of ceramics. Their complex properties are interesting both from basic research and application point of view. Our previous work focused on the properties of proton conductors with low entropy. The current project aims on understanding of the relation of high configurational entropy of rare-earth ortho-niobates and their crystalline and electronic structure. The measurement of x-ray absorption will possibly reveal the relation between the cation composition and unoccupied electron densities for studied materials, this can be then linked to the materials electrochemical performance, ionic conductivity, and proton uptake. This will lead both to a better understanding of phenomena occurring in these materials but also will allow tailoring materials with desired properties for applications in proton-conducting cells.","125":"We propose the study of silica covered Fe2+ triazole nanoparticles (with a diameter of 10-50 nm), which have potential applications in thermally responsive agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), by means of temperature dependent XAFS measurements. In the samples under study, Fe forms polynuclear coordination complexes with triazole ligands in a chain-like fashion. It is expected that the magnetic and structural properties of the Fe-triazole nanoparticles will be affected by the synthesis route, the nanoparticle size, and doping with lanthanide elements Spectra acquisition at temperatures ranging from 4 K to around 350 K is requested, because various types of temperature-induced transitions take place. More specifically, at low temperatures spin ordering is expected.At intermediate temperatures order-disorder transition of the chain arrangement may be detectable while in the temperature range 300-350 K, spin-crossover happens. ","126":"We plan to investigate the morphological (TEM), microstructural (XAFS) and electronic (XPS-XANES) properties of Pd based catalysts for direct synthesis of H2O2.

It leads to a formation of metallic nanoparticles well\r\nsocketed to the oxide support and therefore resistive to agglomeration. In contradiction to the simultaneous exsolution of at least two types of ions from the oxide structure, the topotactic ion-exchange exsolution produces the layered perovskite without B-site vacancies, thereby preserving the atomic connectivity of the B\u2013O\u2013B network for efficient oxygen transport and electron conduction. The aim of this proposal is to investigate nanometric alloys or intermetallic compounds consisting of Ni\/Fe\/Co\/Cu which were formed on the surface of (La,Sr,Ce)TiO3-based host material. The measurements of X-ray absorption will reveal the local structure and valence state of the transition metals in formed nanometric alloys of intermetallic compounds on the surface, as well as the valence of the elements in the perovskite host oxide.","129":"Chromium is a common contaminant in soil due to its frequent industrial application. For the past two decades, chromium is considered as one of the top 20 contaminants on the Superfund priority list of hazardous substances. Hexavalent Cr(VI) is carcinogenic and toxic for organisms. The quantification of Cr(VI) in the most Crpolluted soil samples is not accurate because high content in organic matter causes a considerable or complete reduction of Cr(VI) during phase extraction. Cr speciation by chemical analytical methods is rather complicated. XANES spectroscopy can probe all the irradiated chromium atoms in a sample to directly determine its chemical chromium composition. Different chromium species show unique spectral features that estimate different chromium oxidation states. A more complete characterization of chromium compounds in the soil will be derived from the quantitative EXAFS analysis and the comparison between XANES spectra of chromium in the soil and reference compounds.","130":"Solid Oxide Cells are promising candidates for the creation of smart grid systems that will maintain undisturbed energy flow, especially with a high share of\r\nrenewable sources. The present proposal is dedicated to the structural analysis of the cermet-supported catalysts containing active centres made of metallic\r\nnanoparticles introduced via the conventional wet impregnation route, focusing on the intermetallic synergistic behavior between Ni and secondary metal. The\r\ntransition metals were added into Ni\/YSZ scaffold as a cost-effective alternative to noble metals. The introduction of a secondary promoter metal resulted in\r\naltered electrochemical and catalytic efficiency of the electrochemical devices from the SOCs family, especially when water\/CO2 coelectrolysis mode is applied.The measurements of high-energy X-ray absorption K edges should reveal the relation between the Ni valence, type of secondary metal added, and the oxidation states within new intermetallic phases itself.","131":"Catalytic total oxidation of methane is a state of the art method to abate the CH4 traces in exhaust gases. To this aim, Pd-based catalysts are commonly employed. However, despite the great scientific interest in these materials, a sound identification of the main active site in Pd catalysts is still required. Recent research suggested that the presence of oxidized Pd2+ species is crucial for catalyzing methane oxidation, at least at high temperature. For this reason, we synthesized redox supports consisting of pure and Pr-doped ceria, able to promote the presence of oxidized Pd species. In this project, we will use the LISA@ESRF XAS beamline to investigate the interactions between Pd and Pr-doped ceria. In this way, we will discover how Pr loading affects the chemical environment and oxidation state of Pd species, and how these properties evolve during the catalysis. The results from this study will help in the rational design of more active and stable catalysts for methane oxidation.","132":"High-entropy oxides (HEOs) are multiprincipal-element compounds of exhibiting high configurational entropy, which governs their phase stabilization. The presence of many different cations in one crystal structure may lead to unique electrochemical properties. This project aims to determine the subtle structural and electronic features of a group of high-entropy perovskite materials that exhibit ionic conductivity and in particular \u2013 proton conductivity. The result will not only help in understanding the influence of high entropy on crystal and electronic structure but also set a direction in tailoring more efficient compositions for application in proton-conducting cells.","134":"Ceria-based compounds are known to play a significant role in electrochemical devices. They have been reported as capable of exsolving metallic nanoparticles to the surface of their grains. These nanoparticles can act as catalytic centres for electrochemical reactions, then we can expect even more efficient operation of SOFC cells modified in this way. However, the exsolution in fluorite structures has not been deeply investigated. Almost all of the papers related to this process refer to perovskite structures. Therefore, the aim of this project is to make a systematic analysis of ceria doped with different transition metals (e.g. Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni) and to determine the influence of temperature and time of reduction in hydrogen on the final exsolution process. The measurements of X-ray absorption will reveal the local structure and valence state of the elements, simultaneously providing a valuable set of data for DFT calculations of these structures. ","136":"Unravelling the lithium storage mechanism of alternative anode materials is critical for the ongoing development of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Previously, we have performed a comprehensive XAS characterization of various metal-doped CeO2 anode materials, in particular Fe-doped CeO2, revealing the atomic scale reduction of the dopant within the host structure. Our results provide information on the oxidation state of the cations upon cycling and on the structural mechanism of dopant incorporation and its effect on the de-\/lithiation mechanism. We aim to extend the reaction mechanism to Ru-doped CeO2. Remarkably, doping CeO2 with 15 at-% Ru provides the highest capacity among all metal-doped CeO2 anodes studied so far. Ex situ & operando XANES spectra are pivotal for elaborating the evolution of valence states and the bonding state of the electroactive species. Longer ex situ EXAFS will reveal the evolution of coordination environment and local structure around Ru and Ce. ","137":"The aim of the proposal is to analyse Fe local structure with XANES and EXAFS in plant tissues (roots leaf+stem and kernels) treated with both Fe nano-fertilisers and standard Fe salts. The new trend in agriculture biofortification is to use nano formulations to diminish an excessive diffusion of fertilizers in the soil and the quantity of fertilizer utilized. These new strategies may have effects on the Fe speciation within the plant cell that can change Fe homeostasis and its role in proteins as a key oxidative stress quencher enzymatic cofactor. This project will provide fundamental information for the comprehension of the fate of Fe nano-fertilisers in maize (Zea mays L.).","138":"Gold rod-shaped nanoparticles (AuNRs) thanks to their anisotropic shape display a peculiar optical behaviour, consisting in two plasmon bands: a transverse\r\n plasmon band corresponding to an electron oscillation along the short axis of the rod, at around 510\u2013550 nm, and a longitudinal plasmon band, in the range\r\n 600\u20131200 nm. Indeed, the nanorods\u2019 aspect ratio can be modified by the strict control of the experimental parameters during their chemical synthesis, allowing\r\n to opportunely tune the position of the plasmon bands. The possibility to modify ad hoc the AuNRs surface is a key point in the realization of very advantageous\r\n nanomaterials for applications in biomedicine. In this context, our strategy is to chemically synthesize AuNRs of controlled size and shape (mean sizes of about\r\n 20x80nm - 15x70nm) using L-cysteine as stabilizing agent and linker to Cu(I) coordination compounds. Here we propose to investigate by XAS the local structure\r\n around Cu and Au atoms.","139":"Nickel and its alloys have extraordinary electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), being suitable substitute of platinum group metal (PGM) to cut water electrolyzers cost. Still, the identification of the oxidation state of the metal active sites and its reversibility during operation is lacking for these materials; it is crucial to understand and improve the electrocatalyst reactivity and durability. The oxidation state of Ni and NiM alloys (M=Fe,Mo), when subject to polarization in an electrochemical (EC) cell will be evaluated through X-ray Adsorption Spectroscopy (XAS). The primary goal will be to probe variations in metal speciation, via XANES and EXAFS, both ex-situ and in-operando. This study will: i) reveal the dynamics of variation of Ni active sites oxidation state during constant voltage polarization; ii) identify the reversibility of the process; iii) identify the effect of the exposure of the electrocatalyst to the air (ex situ vs in operando).","140":"Thermal expansion is a problem in many technological applications and its control represents a challenge for the material design. An intriguing thermal expansion behaviour is displayed by both YbPdIn and YbAl2 compounds, i.e., their volume thermal expansion shows an anomalous deflection at around room temperature (Figure 1). This phenomenon is due to a charge transfer process driven by Yb atoms [1]. However, the effects of charge transfer phenomena on the local vibrational dynamics, in particular on the transverse atomic vibrations related to negative thermal expansion (NTE), are still unknown. Accordingly, we aim to shed light on this unclear relationship between charge transfer and local dynamics by means of temperature-dependent XAFS spectroscopy.","141":"Hollandites and pyrochlores are minerals featuring tunnel-like cavities within which a wide variety of mono- and divalent cations can be hosted. The aim of our project is to evaluate the ability of such structures to incorporate and remove heavy metals from contaminated waters. Preliminary experiments revealed that both pyrochlores and hollandites can incorporate Tl and Pb via ionic exchange.\r\nWe want to perform XAS measurements at the L3 edge of Tl and Pb on exchanged samples of pyrochlores and hollandites to obtain information on the coordination environment of Tl and Pb within the tunnels of the crystal lattice of hollandites and pyrochlores.

The presence of hydrogenothrophic microorganisms (methanogens) in natural gas deposits, where electrochemically produced hydrogen is stored, can strongly affect both the fuel stability and the degradation rate of metallic pipelines, leading to strong economic losses. This corrosion mechanism is strongly related to the methanogenesis process, which is still not well documented. With the proposed experiment we intend to evaluate the oxidative states and degree of crystallinity of corrosion products formed on the surface of four alloys (carbon steel, duplex stainless steel, electrolytic copper and duplex brass), exposed to both a methanogens-rich solution (from a biogas plant) and a sterile condition to elucidate on the methanogenesis\/corrosion mechanism and to evaluate the severity of the corrosive attack.","143":"A general lack of experimental data on the crystal structure and local distortions in High Entropy Alloys (HEAs), all factors considered crucial for the understanding of mechanical properties, emerges from the latest reviews. This project plans to directly tackle some of these aspects on a so-called Senkov alloy based on Ti-Zr-Nb-Hf-Ta. We plan to investigate by means of X-ray absorption Spectroscopy the HEA together with its binary and ternary precursors thus investigating the role of each element and correlate it to the Senkov \u201cmother\u201d alloy. The Senkov alloy family was chosen because it is the most studied in literature from the mechanical properties point of view, but detailed structural information at the atomic scale are still missing. The results will be then related to i) mechanical properties (to be measured on the same compounds and integrated with the literature), and ii) on-going crystal structure investigation on similar hcp-based and fcc-based high entropy alloys.\r\n","144":"Metal oxides photoanodes, such as WO3\/BiVO4 heterostructures, represent the state of the art towards photoelectrochemica (PEC) water splitting, although their efficiency is still hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited charge separation efficiency. Mixed Cobalt-Iron co-catalysts proved to be effective to temper such issues, however, a full comprehension of the catalytic cycle underlying such enhancement is yet to be achieved. \r\nTo this aim, steady-state operando XAS measurements proved to be a powerful tool to probe the catalyst structural and electronic features under working conditions, but fail in probing transient catalystic sites. Here, we propose a new kind of fixed energy X-ray fluorescence, where light intensity is modulated at a fixed frequency to \u201cblock\u201d transient states in a fixed oxidation state, which now can be easily probed by continuously measuring the fluorescence signal at the edge of the absorption of the specific element. ","145":"Recently, Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) can be considered a solution for the elimination of atmospheric CO2 and limiting its negative environmental impact. In this study a series of novel alterations were introduced into the structure of conventional SOEC based on standard Ni-YSZ steam electrode. Single cells were enriched with transition metals (Cu, Mn, Co, Fe, Zn) as well as non-toxic and affordable alkaline metal oxide promoters, namely K, Na, Rb, and Mg. A series of preliminary catalytic tests revealed great increase in the activity towards CO2 reduction while performing co-electrolysis of the CO2\/H2O mixture despite of relatively small amount of the additives. This proposal involves XAFS (ESRF), that was selected to find the causes of the sudden catalytic enhancement. The technique will involve in-situ or quasi in-situ measurements of chemical surroundings of the transition metals and alkaline promoters under reactants atmosphere and elevated temperature. ","146":"Our research programme aims at designing and preparing innovative nanostructured systems of different shape, size and composition, mainly made of noble metals and ad hoc functionalized with appropriate organic or organometallic molecules, for a wide range of applications ranging from pollutants sensing to nanomedicine to optoelectronics and quantum optics. In this framework, we recently designed and synthesised chiral nanoparticles (NPs) made of Au and Ag and stabilized by L-cysteine, by following a bottom-up approach leading to chiral nanostructures (as proved by preliminary optical and morphological characterization); in this strategy, the chiral biomolecule L-cysteine is envisaged to act as template to drive the synthesis toward a chiral structure of the NPs. Here, we plan to perform XAS at the Ag K-edge and Au L(III)-edge to gather information about the local structure at the cysteine-silver and cysteine-gold interface and to characterize the metal local structure.","147":"The aim of this proposal is to better understand the operation of Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FeRAM) based on HfxZr1 xO2 thin films (HZO) and the impact of electrical cycling on the material structure. This will be carried out by investigating the local environment via X ray Absorption Spectroscopy at the Hf L3 and Zr K edge, within the HZ O film constituting the FeRAM. Different material configurations (solid solution vs multilayer) and impact of cycling will help to better underst and the physical mechanisms behind.","148":"Fuel cells and electrolysers represent one of most promising alternatives for electrical energy production and storage. Today these technologies rely on nanoparticles (NPs) dispersions as electrocatalysts for the reactions of interest. A lot must be still done to acquire a full understanding of the phenomenon that occur at the surface of the NPs. Moreover, some concern is raising toward the possibility of the NPs to be dispersed in the environment during devices duty-life, promoting long-term health and environmental hazards. To overcome this issue, novel embedded catalysts should be developed, with a strong anchoring to a wide-area macroscopic substrate. Our proposal aims to characterize the evolution of a Ruthenium embedded electrocatalyst, used for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) in electrolysers, via operando XAS. Particularly, we intend to study the ruthenium\/ titanium oxide substrate interaction which strongly influences the electrocatalyst performances","149":"This proposal focuses on understanding molecular processes crucial for selecting bioengineered organisms and\ndevelopping biomolecular approaches for the purification of zinc, iron and REE.

This new material was tested in our labs and resulted a very good photocatalyst for the hydrogen production from water, thus the structural study of the samples under light irradiation will be also carried out.","151":"The main objective of the proposal is to investigate the structural role of Zn in human insulin (HI) polymorphs (hexamers adopting structures described as T6, R6, T3R3) using XAFS spectroscopy which provides the local bonding environment of this ion (tetrahedral \/ octahedral coordination, binding sites, distances to the neighbouring atoms)  complementing the crystallographic data obtained by the group that will prepare the samples. The samples under study will be solutions of HI polymorphs co-crystallized with Zn in the presence of different salts, small organic molecules (phenolic or benzoic acid derivatives), and at solutions with different pH values. Samples at different synthesis stages (supersaturated solution, precipitates, crystals) will be also studied. The synthesis conditions are expected to affect the HI polymorphs to be formed. RT Zn-K-edge XAFS spectra will be used for the identification of the polymorphs and their relative content in case of their coexistence.","152":"Metallic glasses (MGs) exceptionally combine the strength and elasticity of metals with an amorphous structure, producing amongst the strongest and toughest metals known. Despite their exceptional properties, MGs face a serious problem: they are inherently metastable and known to exhibit abrupt und currently unpredictable property losses such as ageing-induced embrittlement, an experimental observation that lacks a structural understanding. The element-specific X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique could be leveraged in this direction, allowing probing structural evolutions in MGs experimentally around individual alloy components. Preliminary XAS data show clear atomic rearrangements as a function of time and temperature around Zr in a Zr-Cu-Al alloy, leading us to the idea of further explore the time-temperature-transformation diagram in the proposed experiment.","153":"Novel materials for metal\/semiconductor contacts such as Sc and Mo have shown great promise to achieve record low contact resistivity values. However, a detailed study of the structural properties of the corresponding metal silicides has not been conducted and is essential to enable further improvements in contact resistivity.

An understanding of the speciation and solubility of Ta in hydrothermal solutions is key in helping both Ta exploration and mineral processing. High-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can reveal fine features of the XANES spectra, thus help identifying important Ta aqueous complexes (with O, F and Cl) that are hard to identify using conventional XAS detection techniques. This study plans to measure the coordination structure and solubility of Ta in hydrothermal fluoride and chloride solutions at up to 500 \u00b0C and 800 bar to better understand the transport and deposition properties of Ta and its fractionation from its geochemical twin niobium (Nb) in hydrothermal systems.","155":"Rare earth elements (REE) are essential to modern life, yet we know little about how they concentrate at Earth\u2019s surface, especially on phosphatized marine deposits, which hold vast reserves. We propose to study the crystal chemistry of neodymium in natural apatites from marine and terrestrial deposits. We hypothesize that the site occupation of Nd is indicative of its geochemical enrichment processes. If enrichment occured via diffusion-substitution in the apatite nanopores, then the REE should occupy the Ca2 site. If the enrichment results from precipitation of authigenic apatite, then the REE is expected to occupy the Ca1 and Ca2 sites. The results will inform atomistic calculations aimed at modeling the scavenging kinetics of Nd in ore deposits.","156":"Wildfires represent a growing environmental forcing on continental ecosystems. An underestimated impact is trace metals dispersion toward freshwater systems after soil heating. In New Caledonia where Ni-rich ultramafic soils are widespread, such a dispersion is suspected to be partly responsible for the significant nickel impregnation of the inhabitants through consumption of impacted freshwater. The aim of this proposal is to address this issue by assessing nickel speciation at a model site representative of the most fire-sensitive drinking water catchment sites of this French overseas Territory. Ni K-edge XAS information will be coupled with data on nickel leachability to understand how wildfires can impact drinking water quality through nickel dispersion from ultramafic soils\/sediments. Beyond the single case of New Caledonia, this work will serve as a model study for Ni-rich mafic and ultramafic tropical continental settings, which are increasingly exposed to wildfires. ","158":"We will study the interactions of Ni ions with iron oxides goethite and maghemite-magnetite solid solutions (Fe3-dO4) in aqueous solution, as well as the impact of natural organic matter on these interactions. We make the hypothesis that adsorption of Ni2+ on different Fe-oxides (or its adsorption on specific crystal faces of a given mineral) will lead to surface complexes with different structures. Because isotope fractionation is sensitive to the local chemical environment and bond distances in the formed complexes, this may affect the fractionation of Ni isotopes, which could be used as a tracer in environmental studies. Here, we propose a Ni K-edge HERFD-XAS on FAME-UHD to determine the local environment of Ni at Fe-oxide surfaces, which is otherwise very challenging to perform on lower resolution beamlines because of the close energies of Ni and Fe K-edges","160":"Today, nanophosphors are required for various applications, including association with micro-LED. Two routes can be used to achieve nanosized phosphor particles namely bottom-up and top-down. As part of a PhD thesis, we applied the second one to produce cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce). However, the used grinding process is responsible of a drop of optical properties, which has been correlated with the formation of an amorphous layer at the nanocrystal surface. On the basis of the evolution of UV spectra profile, we postulated partial in-situ cerium (III) oxidation into cerium (IV), which could be concomitant with amorphization. To the best of our knowledge, this doping element valence modification during grinding has been reported for other phosphors, but not for cerium in YAG matrix. Consequently, the goal of the present proposal is to confirm this hypothesis through X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine Ce4+ \/Ce3+ ratio  on milled samples.","161":"Hydrogen production is a major axis for the future energy transition. Sulfide catalysts and in particular MoS2 are widely studied for electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HER).  Our preliminary data show that atomically dispersed Mo, Re and Mo-Re sulfide clusters are highly active in the HER. However their catalytic action is far from being understood. For example, since ultradispersed sulfide clusters are very prone to oxidation, it is unclear whether the active species are sulfide or oxysulfide ones. In this proposal by combining high resolution XANES with catalysts ultradispersion we strive to unravel the catalytic mechanisms in the ultradispersed sulfides: to study the structure of ultradispersed Mo, Re and Mo-Re sulfide species and to compare them with the nanoparticle references; to clarify the electronic effects in the mixed Mo-Re sulfide species and to follow redox transformations of ultradispersed sulfide clusters in a wide range of electrochemical potentials.","162":"Traditionally, Ni-carbene catalysts are regarded as either heterogeneous (functionalized nanoparticles) or homogeneous (complexes). However, in the past decade, seminal work by Ananikov and co-workers has established that Pd- and Pt-based carbene-functionalized nanoparticles, clusters and complexes co-exist in a dynamic equilibrium. High-resolution X-ray absorption measurements (HERFD-XAS) have proven useful for the resolution of complex reaction mixtures. The interpretation of XAS is facilitated using cross-reading based on computational models. Since solvent effects are crucial for these systems, molecular dynamics simulations at the DFT level (DFT-MD) of fully solvated Ni nanoparticles in a solvent cell are expected to provide an appropriate model for these complex systems. We will use a combined HERFD-XAS and DFT-MD approach to probe ligand effects on the behavior of carbene-ligated Ni nanoparticles, focusing on the leaching to clusters and molecular complexes in solution.","163":"Redox reactions play a crucial role in magma geochemistry influencing several phenomena. Mineral-melt partitionning is such a phenomenom and serves as an oxybarometeter for magmatic systems. Cerium displays mineral-melt partitionning into zircon even though the access of reduced Iron in magmetic systems should forbid the Cerium oxydation, at the core of its mineral-melt partitionning. One hypothesis developed in the litterature is the presence of a charge-transfer reaction between Cerium and Iron occuring during quench. Even though similar charge transfers have been observed between different elements, the charge transfer between Cerium and Iron is only suspected. We will investigate in situ the redox state of both Cerium and Iron at high temperature in silicate melts using Cerium L3-edge XANES spectroscopy and Iron K-edge XANES spectroscopy. This will allow us to assess if the redox interaction is of charge transfer nature or a diffusive process.","164":"In the Orne River, industrial residues were dumped during decades, stored under river waters. With the dam opening, the contaminated banks suffer oxidation, sunlight. The modification of hydrology also enhanced the erosion of bottom parts of the river banks (increase of water velocity), and increased the amplitude of water table oscillations. Using XAS experiments at Fe and Zn edge, we aim at following the mineralogical evolution of these ancient industrial deposits in order to assess the mobility of contaminants such as Zn.","165":"Abstract\r\nImproving NH3 SCR catalytic performance of MnOx as well as suppress the N2O formation under wet condition are very crucial to better design Mn-based catalyst working in the real condition. Hence, we prepared atomic Mn speices supported on the TiO2 using impregnation method and tested in the NH3-SCR reaction both in dry and wet condition. We found that Mn species were highly dispersed on the TiO2 support from HAADF-STEM\/EDX mapping. Based on our previous experiment results at the ESRF (A30-2-1160), this Mn single atom structure has been well confirmed, no Mn-Mn bond was observed from EXAFS. Mn single atom showed higher NO conversion, better water tolerance and less N2O formation. Besides, the N2O formation dramatically decreased under wet condition compared to dry condition. We speculated these could be closely related to different Mn sites\u2019 local environment at wet SCR condition, which can be further confirmed with an operando XAS study.","166":"The objective of the measurements is to study the incorporation of manganese atoms in diluted magnetic perovskites (2D Ruddlesden-Popper PEAPI perovskites and 3D MAPI perovskites). XANES will attest the electronic state of Mn atoms with a particular focus on the pre-edge regions to reveal eventual peak features and thus enabling a precise comparison with electronic band structure.

In this context, bio-inspired technologies could bring neat alternative to traditional pyro-metallurgy. Extraction strategies using bacterial proteins specific to REEs have recently emerge. This project aims to study the Nd complexes formed by molecules identified in the bacteria model Pseudomonas putida, such as periplasmic protein and siderophore.The second objective is to characterize Nd speciation in P. putida whole cells and compare it with the speciation of soluble proteins, with P. putida cultures performed in different media.This project should help to understand the implication of different ligands in REE behavior in P. putida. ","168":"Cadmium in agricultural soils is a matter of increasing concern, for food safety reasons. While some Cd is anthropogenic \u2013 mostly added with fertilisers \u2013 soils also contain geogenic Cd.\r\nTo decipher the combined impact of Cd from fertilisers and soils, it is essential to better understand the fate of geogenic Cd from the bedrock to the soil profiles.\r\nThe aim of the proposal is to understand the speciation of Cd in soil horizons from different soil types, previously characterized. We selected 3 soil types of agricultural significance (Cambisol) and wide occurrence and\/or biogeochemically contrasted (Regosol, Podzol), developed on various bedrocks (granitic, versus calcareous), with various Cd content. The overarching goal is to explore the possible relation between the evolution of Cd speciation from bedrock to upper soil horizons with the Cd isotope signature and decipher the possibility to develop a new indirect tracer of Cd speciation in the critical zone.","169":"Due to its long half-life and high activity, 79Se is an important radionuclide to monitor for a correct assessment of the safety of nuclear waste repositories. Selenate [Se(VI)], the most oxidized form of Se, is an anion with high mobility in the pore waters of the clayey formations that will host the French repository for high-activity and long-life nuclear waste. It is known that magnetite, a Fe(II)-bearing phase present as a result of the corrosion of the steel canisters, can reduce selenate to elemental Se, a non-mobile solid species. Here, we aim at studying how carbonate \u2013an ion present in the pore waters of the repository- and Fe(II) \u2013an ion present due to the corrosion of the steel canisters- can affect the reduction kinetics of selenate by interactions at the magnetite-water interface. The presence of these ions could pose kinetic barriers for the reduction. Assessing this risk is essential for reliable assessments of the safety of an underground repository.","170":"Iron is the most abundant redox-active element in many rocks and geofluids. Yet, the redox chemistry of Fe in high temperature geofluids remains controversial. Comprehensive in-situ XAS results suggest that reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) occurs around 200 \u00b0C, yet thermodynamic modelling and the presence of minerals such as magnetite indicate that Fe(III) exists at higher temperatures. Redox-active materials in autoclaves from previous in-situ experiments may have affected the results; here we plan to use sealed silica capillaries to measure the speciation of iron in saline geofluids at temperatures over 200 \u00b0C. ","171":"The development of atomically dispersed Fe atoms with zeolite catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx has a broad scientific and technological interest.Thus,we synthesized highly dispersed Fe-zeolite through a novel approach,which showed high catalytic activity and stability compared to a series of zeolite catalysts having Fe clusters. Our lab-based characterization and ex situ XAS analysis showed that isolated tetrahedral and octahedral Fe atoms exist in the zeolite framework (doi.org\/10.1002\/anie.202311048). However, fundamental insight into the nature\/structure of the catalyst under reaction conditions is lacking. Therefore, using operando XAS for NH3-SCR of NOx leads to understanding the nature of catalytic sites probing the structural evolution of these sites under real conditions. Simulation of theoretical structures, followed by the linear combination fitting will provide an insight into the chemical\/structural transformation of isolated sites during the reaction.","172":"About 2.4 Ga ago, the Earth transitioned from an anoxic to an oxygen-rich world through the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). The origin and precise timing of this event remain still highly debated in the Earth Science community. The study of Cerium (Ce) may be key to solve major questions around the GOE as we recently demonstrated that Ce stable isotopes were not fractionated the same way in seawater precipitates formed before and during the GOE. We hypothesized that a stronger isotopic fractionation occurred in oxygen-rich seawater, when Ce got oxidized from +III to +IV onto Fe-oxide precipitates. The use of XANES to probe the redox state of Ce into different mineral phases in the pre and syn-GOE sediment samples is crucial to test this hypothesis. The preservation of a higher Ce4+\/ Ce3+ ratio in the syn-GOE samples will undoubtedly establish Ce stable isotopes a novel redox tracer to strengthen our knowledge of the oxygenation state of the past oceans in the early Earth.","173":"Chromium IV-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG) materials are widely used as saturable absorbers (SA) in YAG:Nd lasers. However, the low doping rate\r\n(about 1%at) reported in literature leads to poor SA properties whereas the complex doping mechanism of the matrix leads to a cohabitation between various\r\nions: Cr3+, octahedral Cr4+ and tetrahedral Cr4+. As only the latter is responsible for the SA properties, its concentration must be manageable to achieve better\r\nproperties. We successfully synthesized YAG:Cr powders with a Cr doping rate of up to 30%at via Pechini synthesis and coprecipitation. UV-Vis spectroscopy\r\nsuggests that the synthesis route has an influence on the Cr oxidation state and on its crystallographic environment. The goal of this proposal is 1\/to identify these\r\nfeatures depending on the synthesis route and thermal treatment to unravel the synthesis and doping mechanisms and 2\/to define the best conditions leading to\r\nthe most efficient SA.","174":"The formation and reaction mechanism of polynuclear copper hydrides remain unstudied since their first synthesis in the late 80s. This is due to the myriad of potential active species that can arise from aggregation and fragmentation of Cu. Carrying out mechanistic studies requires structural information on the intermediate complexes, clusters and particles. EXAFS is a suitable method to resolve complex reaction mixtures, and spectroscopic simulation on realistic models can assist the interpretation of the data.\r\nWe will identify the key reaction intermediates in the formation and reactivity of copper-hydride cluster-catalyzed reductions using multivariate-resolved HERFD-EXAFS assisted by spectroscopic simulation on a library of potential intermediates sampled computationally through DFT-MD.","175":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the oxidation state and local structure of active species in Ni_ZSM-5 catalysts during the dimethyl ether (DME) to gasoline process using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), density functional theory (DFT)-assisted EXAFS simulations, and other characterization techniques. The scientific basis of this proposal is to understand the changes of the local structure and chemical state change of Ni species under different conditions and their effect on catalytic performance, thereby unravelling the catalytic mechanism and specifying the contribution of Ni species with different oxidation states and the interaction between Ni species and carbonyls. The expected results include quantifying in-situ generated Ni species during the catalytic reaction and deciphering the local structure of Ni species, which would provide valuable insight into the catalytic mechanism and elucidate the dynamic evolution of Nickel species.","176":"Occurrences of seleniferous soil and associated selenium (Se) toxicities to plants, animals, and humans are environmental concerns in Punjab, India. These Se toxicities are attributed to the high Se uptake and accumulation in edible plants. Our two experiments at the FAME-UHD beamline investigated the temporal dynamics of Se speciation in the topsoil and different parts of the rice and wheat plants over a rice-wheat crop rotation season in a seleniferous agriculture plot, where rice crop residue had been incorporated for four years. Results showed that organic Se is the dominant Se reservoir in this soil, and plants primarily uptake Se from the soil as organic Se. However, the origin of this organic Se in soil could not be identified conclusively due to the limited number of sample analyses. Therefore, we propose further beamtime at the FAME-UHD beamline for the speciation of Se in additional soil samples.","177":"Methyl mercury is highly toxic and is mainly produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in anoxic aquatic ecosystems. Understanding this Hg biomethylation process is important. In this study, we examine the role of bHgS nanoparticles in Hg methylation by the model SRB strain Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri (BerOc1). Our objective is to identify and quantify the various Hg species in the cells and different fractions.  For that, we will use Hg L3-edge High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected -X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) from FAME-UHD beamline that proved powerful to determine Hg species.","178":"Lateritic profiles from Suriname and Austalia may be strongly enriched in V, with V contents up to 3750 mg\/kg in the most strongly weathered units. The elucidation of the evolution of V solid speciation is necessary to fully understand the processes governing exceptional enrichments in laterites , and more broadly the dynamics of V during weathering. Moreover, to predict V solubility, bioavailability, and therefore, toxicity, solid speciation determination is required, as well as redox state. The vanadium K-edge (5465 eV) is informative, and in this experiment, we propose to focus on bulk and spatially resolved XANES measurement. In that frame, we propose to accurately identify the evolution of V redox states and solid speciation in a selection of samples using X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

However, prior to any in-vivo or clinical applications,\ntheir stability in biological systems and biocompatibility must be fully investigated. We have developed a panel of Ag2S with differing sizes and optimised optical\nproperties. Via XAFS, we intend to study the local structure of silver in these QDs in both aqueous media and cellular models, including 3D cell cultures that mimic\nthe liver.

They are often coupled with thallium that might act as ore pathfinder. On the other hand, the presence of Tl, a harmful pollutant, strongly devaluates sulfide ore and poses environmental threat. To manage such metal resources, we need to know the speciation of trace elements in the mineral to understand their genetic relationships and mechanisms of coupled uptake and release. Here, we will use high-energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the structural and redox state of both Tl and Au in the same samples of pyrite from ore deposits and their synthetic analogues prepared at controlled laboratory conditions. This experiment will allow the factors controlling common Au and Tl enrichment in and release from pyrite to be identified. The data will help more efficient and safe prospection and treatment for gold and associated critical metals.","181":"The aim of the proposed experiments is to quantify the distribution of Cu and Zn between fluids and silicate melts to evaluate the efficiency of their extraction upon the degassing of arc magmas.

Indeed, the decorated Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticles exhibit enhanced and finely tuneable magnetic anisotropy, responsible for their efficiency in magnetic hyperthermia or data storage, for example. Nevertheless, different behaviours have been observed on previous magnetism analysis at the L-edges of heteroatoms that decorate the nanoparticles surface, namely Co(II), Zn(II) and MN(II). We hypothesised that the anchoring sites at the nanoparticles surface (either on octahedral or tetrahedral sites) are responsible for such anisotropy modifications. The expected results would help understanding the specificity of coordination sites of these different atoms on the iron oxide and would help explaining the origin of the magnetic anisotropy variations.","183":"CO2 hydrogenation has shown to be a promising technology for reducing CO2 emission. This process typically employs catalysts composed of copper (Cu), zinc oxide (ZnO), and alumina (Al2O3), with the Cu-ZnO interface playing a critical role in catalytic performance. Recent advances have introduced metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to stabilize these nanoparticles and prevent sintering. Recently, we developed a new catalyst embedding Cu in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) through ion exchange, showing enhanced activity and stability compared to traditional catalysts. However, understanding the catalyst's behavior under actual operational conditions remains a challenge. In this work, we aim to employ in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study the local environment, electronic structure and oxidation states of Cu under real reaction conditions. ","184":"Excessive phosphorus (P) in surface water ecosystems is a primary cause of eutrophication, and chemical immobilization using Fe-rich materials is a commonly used approach to mitigate eutrophication due to their high affinity toward P. However, the long-term effect of Fe addition on P dynamics at the sediment-water interface is currently poorly understood, especially in environmentally relevant conditions. The objective of the proposed experiment is to determine Fe speciation of Fe amended lake sediments under fluctuating redox and sulfidic conditions with Fe K-edge bulk XAS. These data will allow us to determine how Fe speciation influences the biogeochemical cycle of P in the long term. This understanding is essential for assessing the effectiveness of Fe amendments as a sustainable strategy for improving water quality in rivers and lakes.","185":"A comprehensive Ag K-edge XAS study of oligomeric and polymeric complexes formed by glutathione (GSH) and silver ions is proposed, to complement and provide structural edge to spectroscopic and spectrometric characterization of these complexes. The main issues to be solved are the mode of coordination of Ag (S only vs. S+O), the coordination number (2 vs. 2\/3) and the formation of ring oligomers vs. infinite chain polymers. All three issues are fundamental to the understanding of formation of Ag\/GSH complexes in cells upon the dissolution of toxic silver nanoparticles and their role in detoxication vs. toxicity of silver.","186":"Safe disposal of nuclear waste requires matrix materials with strong resistance against corrosion and dissolution over a period of more than 10E6 years. Zirconium based ceramics might be used as storage material, because their natural analogues zircon, ZrSiO4, and zirconia, ZrO2, are known to remain stable in geological cycles up to approximately 2\u00b710E9 years. We intend to investigate the structural substitution of thorium in Y-stabilized ZrO2 ceramics. Th(IV) is selected for this study because it represents the typical oxidation state IV which appear in Pu, U and Th containing nuclear waste. The aim of this study is to determine to what extend Th(IV) can be introduced into zirconium ceramics without Zr\/Th phase separation.","188":"Fluoride and chloride molten salts are currently the reference fuel for Molten Salt Reactor technologies. But the use of these highly corrosive mixtures exposes the structural materials to high risks of degradation and failure over the lifetime of the reactor. Ni-based alloys have shown the best resistance to molten salts at high temperatures. However, chromium present in these alloys at a relatively high content, is the most likely to dissolve in the fuel salt, leading to chromium depletion in the structural material, and concomitant formation of corrosion products within the salt. The objective of this work is to experimentally determine the chemical speciation of chromium, i.e., as divalent or trivalent species, in key fuel salt mixtures, using static corrosion experiments followed by post-characterization using XANES spectroscopy at the ROBL Beamline. Such study is essential to gain insights into the corrosion mechanisms and for the development of corrosion mitigation strategies.","189":"The dehydration of studtite [UO2(O2)(H2O)2].2H2O is complex but goes through an X-Ray amorphous phase, whose structure is unknown, but possibly U but Possibly U2O7. Importantly it has been the cause of accidents in waste storage facilities. This project aims to explore the dehydration in an in-situ experiment at the U M4-edge by measuring the HERFD-XAS at intermediate temperature points from room temperature to 800 oC where the transition goes [UO2(O2)(H2O)2] to U2O7 to UO3, but no in-situ experiments have been conducted to look for intermediate phases. In addition at structural changes we will measure the v2C XES spectra for a full description on the electronic structure. This work will give more detailed information on the decomposition and structural phases observed in this important material and add to safety cases for both short and long term storage of uranium in waste nuclear fuel cycles.","190":"The aim of the experiment is to clarify the influence of the environmental conditions on the oxidation states of uranium in single \u2018hot\u2019 particles. The particles differ in their structure, elemental and isotopic composition. It is known that there are different classes of particles, which differ in the oxidation state. Previous experiments have shown that the oxidation state of the particle must change from the outside to the inside. They have a significant influence on solubility and bioavailability in the environment. \r\nParticles from different sampling locations and particle classes will be compared with respect to the oxidation states of U. With our possibilities the oxidation states can not be measured but only estimated. Mappings of the oxidation states in the particle should verify the classes and provide additionally information about the dissolution behavior.\r\n","191":"The most debated question to resolve the pre-edge structure of the Actinide (An) L3 XANES is whether the pre-edge structure is due to the dipole allowed (2p-6d) or quadrupole allowed (2p-5f) transitions. If 5f states can be probed at the pre-edge, it will carry important information about the participation of 5f orbitals in bonding as well as the Coulomb and exchange interactions within the 5f shell. We propose to improve the fundamental understanding of the pre-edge transitions by investigating AnO2 systems (An = U, Np, Pu) by means of RIXS and XANES in the HERFD mode at the U L3 edge. The LB5 emission line will be recorded with the ROBL emission spectrometer and incident energy will be selected by Si(311) monochromator, which enables the acquisition of spectra with a substantial gain in resolution. In combination with the experimental results, we will use theoretical methods to provide valuable insights into the electronic structure of the f-electron systems. ","192":"Methods that offer the capacity to probe both occupied and unoccupied states during the same measurement and can monitor the electronic structure of actinide (An) materials on an extended energy scale are very valuable. Recent advances in X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) techniques reveal their potential to provide valuable information on the electronic structure with high energy resolution. Here, molecular systems of U(IV) doped with different ligands (Cl, O, S) will allow us to investigate the sensitivity of valence-band RIXS and XES towards ligands. The electronic structure of the U systems will be studied by valence-band RIXS at the L3 edge. The LB5 emission line will be recorded with the ROBL emission spectrometer, which enables the acquisition of spectra with a substantial gain in resolution. The results will be compared with theoretical calculations in order to get further insights into the description of the electronic structure of the U systems.

The Mo presence is expected to influence the spent\r\n fuel dissolution during reprocessing. This impact may be more or less significant, depending on the speciation of the Mo element in the uranium dioxide. The\r\n aim of this experiment will be to determine the nature of the molybdenum nanoprecipitates formed in several UO2 compounds prepared under oxygen pressure conditions sufficiently different to vary the nature of Mo phase. Given the size of the nanoprecipitates and the expected Mo content in the UO2 (less than or equal to 6 at%), the nature of the phases incorporating molybdenum cannot be determined by XRD in the laboratory. Additionnaly, XANES experiment performed on the same set of samples at Mo edge allow to evidence the valence ste of Mo in the different Mo precipitates.","194":"This proposal aims to investigate Zr1-xUxSiO4 and Zr1-xUxO2 solid solutions prepared by wet chemistry routes (hydroxide precipitation or hydrothermal conversion) then potentially purified by selective dissolution of secondary phases. Solid solutions of Zr1-xUxSiO4 with U contents higher than 70 mol.% have been selected to precise the maximum solubility of U in the zircon phase. HR-PXRD measurement would be necessary to determine the unit cell variation and the potential formation of secondary phases at the very low level.\r\nThe whole solid solutions of Zr1-xUxO2 will be examined to precise the relation between monoclinic and cubic forms for U low contents, to follow the incorporation of U4+ in ZrO2 through the establishment of a precise Vegard\u2019s rule between ZrO2 and UO2 and to evidence potential fluctuations in the chemical composition at the micro-domain\u2019s scale. By this way, it will be possible to validate the wet chemistry route developed for this king of solid solutions.\r\n\r\n","195":"The corrosion of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel in the presence of a radiation field is a reaction that is important during both burning of a fuel in a reactor and in the long-term storage of spent fuel. We will investigate this reaction by using synchrotron x-rays to both drive the radiolytic dissolution and measure x-ray diffraction and reflectivity. To effectively drive radiolysis, we use ~14 keV beam at grazing incidence to the sample surface, with water held on the sample surface by a Kapton water tension cell. This is the same methodology as used for A28-1-1358 on BM28 (17 - 24 May 2023). We will expand on this method by also investigating the possibility of doing in-situ spectroscopy measurements simultaneously. The samples used will be thin films of UO2 and U3O8, both of which will have activity below 1 Bq.","196":"In order to develop alternative pathway for the synthesis of uranium and plutonium oxide mixture for MOx fuel preparation and to evaluate the behavior of representative surrogate systems for spent nuclear fuel, several conversion processes are under study. Among them, the hydrothermal processes of uranium and plutonium peroxide conversion and the hydroxide pathway are considered as promising methods to achieve these objectives. The aim of this proposal will be to achieve the crystallographic characterization of some compounds of interests for these syntheses methods.\r\nOn the one hand, the structures of the actinide(IV) peroxide phases are still poorly identified and require advanced characterization. The actinide oxide obtained thanks to hydrothermal methods would also need characterization. On the other hand, the uranium\/plutonium phases obtained thanks to hydroxide route of coprecipitation require high resolution characterization to identify the potential formation of solid solution.","197":"High-entropy materials (HEMs) such as High-Entropy Oxides (HEOs) offer great structural diversity with astonishing potential to fine tune material properties depending on stoichiometry and composition. High-entropy chlorides (HECl\u2019s) offer similar structural diversity to HEOs and share potential applications in solid-state energy materials such as electrolytes or electrodes for all-solid-state-lithium-ion-batteries. We will perform a systematic XANES and EXAFS study of HECL containing Co2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ Zn2+ , and Sc3+. It will be supported by DFT+U calculations alongside with SC-XRD and other methods.  As a result, we will have a comprehensive structural models, electronic states and either verification or denial of the presence of transition metal clusters for these HECl systems to correlate structure and composition to numerous electrochemical properties such as ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability within batteries.","198":"The study investigates the U-Fe interaction, crucial for understanding uranium's incorporation into iron (hydr)oxide minerals, impacting long-term soil retention. Using U HERFD-XANES at the U M4 edge, the proposal aims for molecular-level insights into U valence and the local environment. Experiments involved U(VI)-sorbed schwertmannite and jarosite, reacted with varying Fe(II) levels over 1 hour to 2 weeks in an anaerobic chamber (O2<0.5 ppm). Recent Fe EXAFS data show schwertmannite transformation to goethite and jarosite to lepidocrocite\/goethite based on Fe(II) levels. U XANES spectra suggest U(V) predominance. U HERFD-XANES will clarify U incorporation in newly formed Fe(III) phases and assess U(IV) reduction in high Fe(II) samples. Insights into kinetics and mechanisms will enhance understanding of U(IV) reduction and repartitioning during schwertmannite and jarosite transformation.","199":"The fate of technetium (Tc) in the environment depends on its interaction with such minerals or microorganisms. In the last decades, research has been oriented towards the immobilization of inorganic Tc by reductants. However, much less is known about how metabolites (produced by microorganisms) could influence the interaction between Tc(VII) and Fe(II)-minerals and on the environmental behaviour of organometallic Tc.\nHence, the factors influencing the mobility of Tc need to be studied in order to ensure the best conditions to prevent (or remediate) the emission of inorganic or organometallic Tc in the environment. The aim of this beamline proposal is analyzing the immobilization of inorganic TcVII (as TcVIIO4\uf02d) by pyrite (FeS2) in presence of metabolites (acetate, succinate and siderophore).

Ex situ studies of reaction products does not allow to elaborate mechanism of oxidation, especially at early stages. Applicant group recently designed procedure allowing to study reactions of acids with microscopic amounts of powder. Time resolved synchrotron radiation XRD study is expected to aid in identification of reaction stages, intermediate phases formed in process of graphite structure expansion and oxidation, to detect microscopic amounts of impurities.

Recent studies have evidence the importance of minor chemical species of U(V), especially when interacting with minerals such as magnetite. There was little knowledge of the exact mechanism involved in U(V) sorption to magnetite. Indeed, magnetite stoichiometry (R = Fe(II)\/Fe(III)) is rarely controlled or monitored in U-magnetite interaction studies, although it was shown to affect not only redox transformation but also adsorption mechanisms of several contaminants. This study examined the interaction of U with 10 nm-sized magnetites, whose stoichiometries were carefully defined (0.1 \u2264 R \u2264 0.5) and preserved in anaerobic conditions. We will conduct HERFD-XANES analysis at the U M-edge to clarify the spectral differences between U(V) on stoichiometries of magnetites, which will help understand the U adsorption mechanism on magnetite and predict the fate and transport of U in environment.","206":"A composition-dependent polymorphism is observed in Y3Rh4Ge13. Y3Rh4Ge13-polymorphs are weakly-coupled BCS-like superconductors. Besides superconductivity, another state-of-the-art property arises from the temperature-dependent characteristics of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity \u2013 charge density wave state appearing below Tf = 177 K. The single crystal diffraction synchrotron studies at 100 K (well below Tf) and 300 K (room temperature, also well above Tf) are acquired to prove the structural transition \nas well as to determine the crystal structure of both low-temperature and high-temperature polymorphic modifications.

By utilizing ADR, we aim to resolve electron density distributions before and after a thermally induced spin-crossover,\nachieving unprecedented precision in the analysis of the electronic and structural changes involved. The experiment will focus on Ru and Ag-based metal organic complexes, and will combine X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) with diffraction data to provide new insights into the interplay between spin states and structural dynamics.","208":"The aim of the project is to investigate the uptake of Se(IV) and U(VI) in chuckanovite (Fe2(OH)2CO3), an Fe(II)-carbonate hydroxide mineral, which can be formed under redox reducing conditions at the interface between the steel container and the bentonite clay barrier in a high-level radioactive waste repository. The characterisation of synthesised chuckanovite confirmed a 100% of Fe(II) in the structure. Batch sorption experiments, demonstrated that chuckanovite exhibits a high retention capacity for Se(IV) and U(VI) at pH 8.2, even in the presence of carbonates. The high Fe(II) content (which enhances redox reduction) and the presence of structural CO32- (which facilitates anionic exchange) can both contribute to the effective retention of radionuclides (RN). However, the formation of other surface complexes cannot be ruled out. Access to ROBL-BM20 beam line is deemed essential for the surface analysis of Se and U-chuckanovite samples and the understanding of retention mechanisms.","209":"Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are high-aspect ratio colloids that self-organize into liquid crystalline phases in solution. Taking advantage of this self- organization behaviour, we strive to develop soft CNC-based artificial muscles capable of directional (anisotropic) actuation. To this end, we decorate the CNCs with temperature-responsive polymer chains and we subsequently align and cross-link these building blocks to form colloidal hydrogels. To achieve directional actuation, the polymer-grafted CNCs must align along a common direction throughout the entire material. This configuration is extremely challenging to obtain and typically requires the use of external orienting fields such as magnetic fields. Using a combination of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) we aim at unravelling the self-organization of these polymer-grafted CNCs and use the acquired knowledge to realize macroscopically aligned nano composite artificial muscles.","210":"Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are an emerging alternative technology to silicon-based solar cells. Our group uses the technique of inkjet-printing (IJP) to manufacture OPVs. This allows precise patterning on a small scale with minimal material waste. Given that the use of IJP has been limited when it comes to the manufacturing of OPVs, we have been trying to shed light on the inter-dependence of crystallinity and processing parameters in inkjet-printed OPVs. So far, we have explored parameters such as the choice of solvent(s), addition of ternary components and printing temperature. This time, we propose the study of microstructural changes brought about by drying behaviour and the use of different acceptors. Concretely, this implies uncovering the molecular arrangement and formation of crystalline domains when 1) processing with solvents of different boiling points and 2) the use of different acceptors in the active layer.","211":"Zeolites are molecular sieves that hold great importance in the field of catalysis, where they are used as (both) an active phase and\/or a catalyst support. Here, we aim to study the interzeolite crystallization process of a FAU mixture to AEI, utilizing SAXS\/WAXS techniques. As a result, engaging the studied mechanism, one can understand the evolution of AEI zeolite from crystalline Si and Al sources with the aim of optimizing the synthesis parameters to control the final Si\/Al ratio of the product.","212":"The aim of this proposal is to collect SAXS\/WAXD based information on the semicrystalline structure of double crystallizable poly(butylene terephthalate)\/poly(ethylene glycol) (PBT\/PEG) multiblock copolymer obtained by very rapid isothermal crystallization at high supercooling. Varying the isothermal crystallization temperature allows not only to crystallize each block (PBT or PEG) separately at selected temperatures, but also to govern the blocks\u2019 crystallization sequence in double crystallizable block copolymers. Furthermore, as the first block crystallizes a certain (intermediate) morphology is generated that strongly affects the crystallization kinetics of the second one as well as the final morphology. The intermediate and final structures remain unknown. To address this issue, SAXS\/WAXS combined with Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC) will be applied.","214":"The selection of biobased macromolecular building blocks and readily available re- and upcycling strategies are opportune to preserve high chemical functionality. However, mass adoption of biobased polyesters, including Polylactide, polyhydroxy alkanoates, and Polyethylene furanoate, is challenged by their intrinsically low crystallization rates. A new family of bis-(oxal)amide nucleating agents to promote high crystallization rates in these biobased polyesters have been developed in our group. By means of the molecular design of the nucleating agents melt miscibility and nucleation are triggered although the exact mechanism of polymer nucleation is unknown to date. By means of single crystal structure analysis at the BM01 high resolution diffraction beamline we aim to decipher the temperature dependent unit crystal structure and unit cell parameters of the nucleating agent self-assemblies that possess a pivotal role in the mechanism of nucleation. ","215":"Amine-grafted metal-organic frameworks such as diamine-Mg2(dobpdc) (dobpdc4- 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) exhibit high CO2 adsorption performance. This is attributed to the cooperative and reversible insertion of CO2 into the metal-amine bonds, forming chains of ammonium carbamate. This chemisorption process improves CO2 uptake at low partial pressures, suitable for post-combustion CO2 capture. However, multicomponent adsorption experiments, conducted in our research group, revealed marked differences in the CO2 adsorption behaviour of diamine-Mg2(dobpdc) under dry and humid conditions, as indicated by in situ IR analysis. This proposal aims to investigate the structural and chemical features that dictate the CO2 capture performance of diamine-Mg2(dobpdc) MOFs at different relative humidity. This requires access to BM01 beamline to conduct in situ XRD experiments coupled with Raman\r\nanalysis of the adsorbent upon exposed to multicomponent mixture (N2\/CO2\/H2O).","216":"","217":"Thermoplastic composites (TPCs) such as glass fibre reinforced polyamide laminates offer a unique material solution for low-carbon mobility applications, enabling high-volume manufacture of inherently sustainable (recyclable) light-weight components. High-performance TPC parts are produced via a rapid stamp-forming process, yielding a complex, transient (non-isothermal) crystallisation environment leading to a distinctly anisotropic crystalline structure. Such variations in structure inevitably lead to local variations in material properties; mapping this inhomogeneity is critical to predicting performance. Particularly, mapping these variations would reveal the local processing history of the material and is critical for the development of accurate process simulation tools. Here, we propose the use of microfocus WAXS to create a detailed map of the crystalline morphology of an industrially-processed polyamide (PA66) laminate material with 60% w.f. glass fibre (PA66-GF60).","218":"CO2(aq)-induced corrosion of energy infrastructure, including geothermal plant, is of huge concern, as it significantly increases the probability of failure.  On this basis, much effort is directed towards controlling this phenomenon, with a go-to option being the addition of organic species, corrosion inhibitors, that reduce corrosion through surface binding.  This technology is well established, although surface-active selection remains largely a trial-and-error procedure, due to a lack of mechanistic insight.  For example, concerning CO2(aq)-induced corrosion, detailed understanding of the interaction between solid corrosion scale (rust) and injected corrosion inhibitors is simply absent.  This proposal will address this issue through coupling quantification of scale growth with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction to electrochemical measurement of corrosion kinetics.  Operando data will be acquired as a function of immersion time, in the absence\/presence of a corrosion inhibitor.","219":"Total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) is a mature technique that is extremely sensitive to trace amounts of analyte, but quantification with a robust uncertainty budget remains elusive. Surprisingly there are and no certified reference materials specially designed for TXRF with which to test and benchmark new instruments. This gap is being explored through international collaborations including the SC10 subcommittee of the ISO TC201 \u201csurface chemical analysis\u201d, a revision of the German standard DIN51003 (Total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis \u2013 Terminology and general principles) as well as the ENFORCE COST Action.  We request beamtime to extend a successful round-robin activity using carefully engineered samples to provide data from a synchrotron beamline that is not dedicated to TXRF analysis. We will also provide input into the development of new reference samples as well as the wider impact of instrumental and experimental parameters on the uncertainty budget.","220":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of Ge in aqueous solution. Several aspects of the Germanium electrochemistry are still poorly understood, the most peculiar aspect maybe the Ge\r\nelectrodeposition process: even at potentials well below the Nernst potential the deposition of Ge seems to be limited to the equivalent of 2.5 Monolayers independently on material and substrate. In the literature\r\nthis is explained with the presence of a surface-limited electrodeposition phenomenon known as Under Potential Deposition (UPD). Although this explanation might support the observation of a self limiting growth process it seems to contradict the fact that the limited same behaviour is observed independently of the substrate composition. This experiment intends to provide a physical explanation for this behaviour.","221":"Pyrrhotite, Fe7S8, is a naturally occurring mineral of interest because of its large remnant magnetisation. It goes through a NiAs-4C (hexagonal-monoclinic) structural phase transition at approximately 600 K that also corresponds to its ferrimagnetic phase transition. This structural phase transition causes the onset of ferroelastic domains or \u2018twins\u2019. In this study, we plan to confirm that ferroelastic domains are unchanged by applying a magnetic field at room temperature, that they disappear above the N\u00e9el temperature and study their dynamics as they reform, quantify the degree of magnetoelasticity and study the reorientation of the twin domains as a function of strain.","222":"Total external reflection fluorescence and grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence are techniques that rely on standing waves created by the reflector to excite the fluorescent emission from small amounts of analytes. Formally, the sample under investigation only perturbs the wavefields slightly resulting in no matrix (absorption) effects and well-defined wavefields. The transition to more bulk-like systems in which this approximation is violated is poorly understood. In this proposal we aim to explore the interface between TXRF and XRF performed under grazing incidence. Our study will explore the experimental conditions and ranges of validity. The data will be an essential part of a recently launched VAMAS study to explore the feasibility of using XRF under grazing incidence to quantify airborne particulate matter as well as a new work proposal (on 23971.2.2) for an ISO standard \u201cAnalysis of air PM filters by XRF under grazing incidence\u201d launched within the ISO TC201 committee.","223":"We want to use scanning diffraction to map the distribution of crystalline phases (non-ferroelectric monoclinic and ferroelectric orthorhombic) in 10 nm Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films integrated in ferroelectric tunnel junctions and investigate how they change upon electrical cycling. The eventual variation of crystal structure in the films upon wake-up electrical cycling and after longer time operation will be investigated by comparing measurements of samples in the pristine state and after ex-situ electrical cycling. ","225":"We propose to study the nematic phase transition of FeSe by measuring Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering (REXS) at selected \u201cforbidden\u201d reflections at the Fe K edge. This nematic phase transition is not accompanied by magnetic ordering, unlike in most other Fe-based superconductors, which makes this crystal an excellent opportunity to study the former without the latter and to deepen our understanding of nematic phase transitions in the vast class of Fe-based superconductors. The hk0 forbidden reflections should be extremely sensitive to any change of the local environment of the Fe atoms, due to the high symmetry of the crystallographic sites of Fe. In addition, we will pay attention to other anomalies reported in the physical properties at other temperatures, and we will look for possible intra-unit-cell magnetism at low temperature.","226":"We seek to investigate, simultaneously: (a) the microstructural changes that occur when an organic semiconductor (OSC) thin film device is mechanically stretched; (b) the changes in the electrical performance of the device This experiment aims to understand how the structural changes correlate with changing device performance. We will install a tensile test stage, as seen in Fig. 1, at the BM28 beamline to enable in operando characterization in grazing incidence geometry. These investigations relate to the field of stretchable electronics and will be of high interest to the organic electronics community.","227":"This experiment aims to map the local variations of Gd magnetization profile through the thickness of GdFeCo ferrimagnetic films with a deliberately designed Gd variation through the film thickness. Hard X-ray resonant dichroism and magnetic reflectivity (XRMR) at the Gd L3 edge (7.24 keV) will be used to map the Gd magnetization profile through the film thickness. Temperature dependent XRMR measurements through compensation, combined with SIMS and SQUID magnetometry, will enable us to understand the evolution of the global and local compensation behaviour. This approach offers a comprehensive understanding of magnetization behaviour arising from compositional non-uniformities and their influence on the evolution of ferrimagnetic compensation in RE:TM alloys for spintronics","228":"Nano-ions such as polyoxometalates (POMs), boron clusters and hydrophobic ions, are nanometric ionic molecules with unique architecture and super-chaotropic properties. Despite nano-ions promising membrane-targeting ability, direct evidence of the proposed mechanism based on the formation and desorption of POM-lipid assemblies is lacking. Following our SANS study of interactions between nano-ions with mixed 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)\/ 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) at ISIS Larmor, and XRR study at Diamond I07 of the nano-ion interactions with the DOPC\/DOTAP Langmuir monolayer at the air-water interface, we propose a comprehensive XRR study to examine in detail the structural changes of supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) mediated by nano-ions, as a function of lipid composition, type of nano-ions, concentrations, and temperature. This will enable Dr Wlodek to successfully complete her H2020 Marie Curie Fellowship project.","229":"There is a great need for the development of sustainable structural materials which offer lightweighting potential addressing the environmental challenges of decreasing CO2 emissions in the automotive industry. Fibre-reinforced polymer composites (FRPs) are a light and cost-effective materials giving directional strength, stiffness, durability and corrosion resistance. FRP materials are semi-crystalline engineering polymers such as polyamides (PA) combined with long fibres of glass (PA-GF). Here, we will look at the structure and morphology development in FRP materials using combined in-situ thermal and Small and Wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS). These combined techniques will allow us to follow the crystalline structure development of the polymer in the material as it is cooled at temperatures mimicking the processing conditions, giving a unique insight into how the processing affects the polymer morphology and hence the mechanical and physical properties of the composite.","230":"Our initial BM28 studies utilised synchrotron X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) on silica and Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) on non-woven cotton to compare their pristine state with that coated with ZIF-8 and curcumin, individually and together. Our findings revealed that the surface coverage depended on the ZIF-8 and curcumin concentrations, confirmed by the SEM imaging of the cotton. Here, we propose a comprehensive XRR and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Scattering (GIXS) investigation to examine the surface structure of silica and cotton modified with ZIF-8 and curcumin, varying their concentrations and ratio ratios. The nanostructural information on the crystallinity of the ZIF-8-curcumin complex under different concentrations will help elucidating the mechanisms underlying the attachment of ZIF-8 to the surface and curcumin-ZIF-8 complexation, underpinning our overall effort to understand the influence of this novel complex on cotton fiber softness. ","231":"Generating p- or n- type semiconductors through the introduction of either phosphorus (P) or boron (B) has underpinned the semiconductor industry for decades. As device scaling moves towards 3D structures, it is necessary to increase doping levels by 2 -3 orders of magnitude to several at.%. This comes with new material challenges as the spatial distribution of the dopants is unknown and can form clusters which influences their functional properties. Here we will use X-ray absorption spectroscopy recorded at the P K edge to probe the local atomic arrangement, clustering, and bonding around the P atoms in samples with 4 at. % doping. Data will be correlated with density function theory (which suggests clusters may form around vacancies) as well as resistivity measurements. The X-ray data will be compared with real space images determined from 3D atom probe and be used to benchmark that new metrology and its analysis protocols.","232":"With this proposal we aim to understand whether Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films - sandwiched between W electrodes \u2013 undergo a structural phase transition (tetragonal to polar orthorhombic) or a structural phase transformation (weakly-developed to fully-developed polar orthorhombic) upon ac electric field cycling. Electric field cycling results indeed in an unconventional piezoelectric behaviour of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2: the dynamic change of its d33 piezoelectric coefficient, from positive to negative. Building on the success of previous investigations at XMaS, the structural evolution of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 will be measured by wide-angle small angle scattering (WAXS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on W\/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2\/W capacitors in the pristine state and after ex-situ electrical cycling. The role of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thickness in the structural change will also be explored.","233":"The development of sustainable structural materials offering lightweighting potential addressing the environmental challenges of reducing CO2 emissions in the automotive industry, is needed.

Nano-encapsulating chemotherapy drugs reduces the harm to healthy cells, increases the efficacy of anti-tumour activity and prolongs the half-life of the medicine whilst it circulates in the blood stream. This project aims to establish the design rules for scalably loading an emerging class of nanocarrier, hyperbranched polymers, with drugs. Maximising the drug loaded into each nanocarrier requires an understanding of the thermodynamic interactions between the drug, solvent and non-solvent as well as the ability to control the kinetics of processing. This study will track the evolution of the phases and structure of nanocarriers during encapsulation to quantify the processing kinetics. These data will be used to optimise the tradeoff between high drug loading and a scalable process. \n\n","235":"The wide bandgap semiconductor material Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an attractive proposition to replace Silicon (Si) for the development of efficient, robust power electronic devices, with commonplace devices only introduced into the market within the last 5 years. In development, is 20 years behind development when compared to Si, with defects which are sources of failure and inefficiency. One major issue in SiC power electronics devices is the long-term reliability. One fundamental, major contributor to variation of device performance over time is the presence of basal plane dislocations in the starting substrate and its expansion and conversion to Shockley type stacking faults. During a test session at the XMaS Beamline (IH-ME-34), a methodology was found to image SiC layers in diffraction mode with high resolution. We propose use this method to image defects that have undergone thermal stress ex-situ to replicate this mechanism so that it can be further understood.","236":"Wessex Chemical Factors Ltd, a UK SME, has developed a novel formulation that unexpectedly exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and positive bacteria and yeasts 48 hours after a single spray application of the product to the surface. Furthermore, the formulation has as its main component polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that creates a smooth and glossy surface which is highly desirable to EU consumers, superior to the USA-developed Microban technology www.microban.com which leaves behind streaky and patchy surface residues.  In collaboration with Wessex, here we propose to use XRR and GIXS to study the nanofilm structure when PDMS and other key formulation actives are deposited on silica substrates. The out-of-plane and in-plane structure will provide mechanistic insights into the effective nanostructure  underpinning their long-lasting antimicrobial efficacy, guiding Wessex formulation optimization.","237":"This experiment will continue our recent successful experiments on XMaS, aiming to clarify the novel current-driven magnetization switching which we have recently observed in CoFeTaB\/Pt ultra-thin film bilayers, where the magnetization in CoFeTaB appears to twist into a stable nanometer-scale 'exchange-spring' configuration close to the interface. We will detect the proximity induced magnetization in Pt, which arises close to the interface with ferromagnetic CoFeTaB, using the element-specificity of resonant x-ray magnetic scattering, and use this to track the interface magnetization in CoFeTaB during field- and current-driven magnetization reversal. This will enable us to unambiguously determine how the current drives energy-efficient interfacial magnetization reversal in this system. We will also begin to look at Ta within the CoFeTaB layer; the distribution of Ta modifies local exchange interaction, and may explain how the exchange-spring state is able to form in such a thin film.","238":"The aim of this proposal is to determine the density of model H2O-CO2 and H2O-CO2-NaCl fluids (10-20 wt% CO2, 10-20 wt% NaCl) at P-T conditions relevant for the formation of ore deposits in the Earth\u2019s crust, up to 500 \u00b0C and 1.5 kbar. The measurements will be conducted in the FAME autoclave using the X-ray absorption technique. The new data will be implemented in accurate equations of state PVTx that will allow the development of quantitative models for the mobility, transport and precipitation of metals in the crust. ","239":"Recycling of organic waste (OW) as fertilizer in agricultural soil is a widely used practice as it ensures sustainable development. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are major inorganic contaminants in organic wastes that accumulate at the surface and pose several risks (e.g. phytotoxicity). The environmental fate and risks posed by these metals depend on their chemical speciation. If we demonstrated that metal speciation is altered by OW type (raw OWs, digestates or composts), we still need to establish the role of soil properties (pH, mineralogy, organic matter, etc.) on the fate of Cu and Zn in OWs amended soils.\r\nWe propose to investigate the impact of Cu and Zn borne OWs on amended soils from two long-term field experiments selected for their contrasted soil characteristics.\r\nDue to the trace level of metals, FAME Beamline in required and best suited for our XAS measurements.","240":"The most supported hypothesis for the orf7a function is the interference with virion budding operated by cellular antigens, while the orf8 function is still unknown. We aim at studying the interaction of orf7a and orf8 with the bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2). BST2 dimerization and oligomerization involve intermolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues and are strongly influenced by the presence of divalent cations, such as Zn2+. We want to test the hypothesis [7] that the orf7a and orf8 proteins have been selected to counteract BST2 antiviral activity by bringing in situ Zn2+ cations owing to the presence of multiple Zn-finger domains. The formation of orf7a\/BST2 and orf8\/BST2 complexes assisted by the presence of Zn2+ may enable the virus to evade the antiviral activity of BST2. In this proposal we aim at determining the Zn2+coordination mode in orf7a, orf8 and BST2 to check the possible formation of orf7a\/BST2 and orf8\/BST2 complexes.","241":"Observing catalysis behavior at atomic level for Mn sites can bring better understanding of its role towards NH3-SCR of NO. Herein, we prepared a series of\r\nhighly dispersed MnOx\/TiO2 via strong electrostatic adsorption with different loadings. Only very small concentration of Mn can achieve attractive NO conversion at elevated temperature. Notably, as Mn loading increased, NO conversion showed different behaviors, indicating Mn sites possibly exhibited different local environment. Based on our laboratory characterizations (XRD, HRTEM, HAADF-STM and Easy-XAFS), no nanoparticle was observed, however we cannot further confirm cluster or single atom which contributed to the performance. To resolve this puzzle, tracking molecularity and oxidation state of Mn at real time by operando XAS is the best option. We expect that this study will provide new insight towards relationship between structure and performance at atomic level for designing superior NH3-SCR catalysts.","242":"One therapeutic approach explored in Alzheimer's disease consists to remove the redox active copper ions bound into the amyloidogenic peptide involved in the disease (amyloid-\u03b2 peptide, A\u03b2). Despite several years of development, this strategy did not yield expected results in terms of therapeutic effects. While most of the ligands studied were thought to target the Cu(II), Cu(I) ligands have been overlooked and might be the missing piece of the puzzle for the strategy to be effective. In this context we have developed N-based thioether and thiolate ligands dedicated to the removal of Cu(I) from A\u03b2 to fill this gap.\r\nThe project aim to gain insights into the binding site of Cu(I) (and Zn(II)) with the designed ligands and to monitor the metal removal from the Cu(A\u03b2) species in presence and in absence of Zn(II). Zn(II) is also present in high amount in the synaptic cleft; its impacts on Cu detoxification by the designed ligands must thus be evaluated.","243":"While the molecule Cyclotriazane (c-N3H3) has been estimated to be stable at room temperature, it has not been isolated yet. The synthesis and stabilization of cyclotriazane has been reported to occur in a zeolite. In 1977, Karl Seff and his colleagues claimed the identification of c-N3H3 by reacting ammonia (NH3) over a silver-exchanged LTA zeolite. The authors proposed c-N3H3to be stabilized by Ag+ in alpha cage of the zeolite. Yet, this result has not be reproduced since and as a matter of fact the synthesis of cyclotriazane by oxidative cyclisation of NH3 is in question. We studied the reactivity of NH3 on a silver-doped LTA zeolite by operando Diffuse Reflectance Infrared FT (DRIFT) spectroscopy. We observed a signal that that cannot be assigned to a known compound yet. The knowledge of the oxidation state of framework silver shall provide indirect evidence whether or not the oxidation of ammonia may occur and thus the possible formation of N-N bonds.","244":"One way to enhance the characteristics of metallic alloys is to refine their microstructure. Promoting the nucleation in the undercooled zone in order to create an equiaxed growth and smaller grain can help achieving this. Some additions of hundreds of ppm of some elements in Al-based or Au-based alloys induce a huge diminution of the grainsize, but also an augmentation of twinned grain boundaries with five neighbouring grains in orientation relation. Those twinned grains could be the result of the creation of an ISRO in the liquid. The ISRO-mediated nucleation in aluminium is a theory that involves the nucleation of an ISRO phase in the liquid that promotes crystallization of alpha-aluminium phase on it. This could explain the high number of twinned grain boundaries. However, this phenomenon has never been directly observed experimentally. This experiment aims to achieve these observations by analysing the local atomic environment of selected elements in our alloys by means of EXAFS.","245":"To meet our needs, humanity today consumes 1.8 times the resources that the planet can renew in one year. Face with this observation, phosphate industry in Morocco, the world leader in the production of this essential resource for the production of fertilizers, has engaged a circular economy plan to guarantee food security while using a minimum of resources and minimizing wastes. In particular, mining wastes from phosphate extraction have shown great potential for the extraction of metals including critical metals, such as Magnesium (Mg) and Rare Earth Elements (REEs) that are the heart of a number of strategic technologies for the environmental transition. In the context of a circular economy, this project aims at studying the potential of wastes from phosphate extraction for the recovery of critical metals.

It is a \u2018critical metal\u2019 due to its strongly limited natural occurrence while it is essential and at present non-replaceable for several industrial applications. The main host phase for Re is molybdenite (100 - 3000 ppm Re) which is mined mainly from porphyry copper deposits (PCDs). Formation of PCDs is based on magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that transport and enrich metals during ascent to shallower levels within the Earth\u2019s crust. While enrichment processes of main metals of PCDs and other magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits (e.g., Fe, Cu) have been studied in detail, only few works so far focus on secondary metals probably due to challenging experimental setups (detection of extremely high dilution levels of Re at high PT conditions). However, this knowledge is essential particular for \u2018critical\u2019 metals to facilitate and support efficient and sustainable exploration of ore deposits. ","247":"The aim of the proposed experiments is to provide new insights into cassiterite solubility and tin speciation in various hydrous supercritical fluids at pressures and temperatures relevant for formation of hydrothermal tin ore deposits using a hydrothermal autoclave and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

So many mechanistic questions remain unanswered.\r\nThe In-situ XRD and XAS measurements proposed here will pioneer the examination of the CVT growth process at the atomic level.","250":"We propose to study the active state of 5wt% Ru loaded catalyst on different catalyst supports at typical NO oxidation conditions for industrial-scale nitric acid synthesis. Hardly any literature reports exist on catalytic oxidation of NO at high concentration, but Ru on zirconia, ceria, titania, and alumina proves to be a satisfactory catalyst for NO oxidation with water, NO2 and a higher NO concentration in our in-house research. We, therefore, want to perform an in-situ investigation on different catalyst supports with 5wt% Ru loaded to it in the presence & absence of NO2. XAS-XRD in combination with mass spectrometry is an excellent combination for studying the local Ru environment in these catalysts at industrially relevant conditions. ","252":"Monitoring changes of catalysts composition and structure during operation is of the uttermost importance to build unambiguous structure\/properties relations and to guide the design of more active, selective and stable catalysts. The aim of this project is to follow and to elucidate the changes in the oxidation states, structure and coordination environments of Cu-Ga electrocatalysts during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) by operando XAS. These materials were recently synthesized in our group, and we have discovered enhanced selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Cu and Ga catalysts. In-house methods are not able to track catalyst changes during operation, and synchrotron-based XAS studies are needed to understand synergistic nature of the performance improvement. The catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability are strongly desired to make CO2RR technology viable, and discovery of new catalytic material is helpful to target rational design of better catalysts.","253":"In heterogeneous catalysis, the exact chemical nature of the catalyst\u2019s active sites can control the reaction mechanism, which is essential to reach high activity. A recently developed liquid atomic layer deposition technique (L-ALD) leverages atom-by-atom growth regimes to create unique interfacial structures generated with unprecedented atomic precision. The proposed project aims to characterize molecular cluster catalysts prepared in this atom-by-atom manner using XASXRD measurement. Specifically, state-of-the-art operando characterization of a liquid ALD-synthetized Cu\/MgOZrO2 catalyst with exceptionally high activity toward CO2 hydrogenation will allow us to identify the nature of the unique active site we have created and better understand the required properties for selective methanol production from CO2.","254":"This proposal aims to characterize by Cu k-edge XAS, to disclose the finest details on the redox chemistry of Cu sites hosted within a selection of Cu-MOFs.

These MOFs, belonging to the UiO-6X family, have been post-synthetically treated to introduce various biomimetic anchoring site, as inspired by the histidine brace coordinating Cu in some enzymes capable of performing C-H bond oxidation. We will focus on the main reaction stages (desolvation, oxidation and reactivity with CH4). Special care will be put in characterizing the oxidized state, aiming at the identification of potentially active Cu-O species. These outcomes will provide unprecedented structural details on the local environment in such Cu-MOFs at the various reaction stages.","256":"ACrF3 and ACuF3 (A = Ag, Na, K, Rb, Cs and NH4) have Jahn-Teller active electron configurations and as a consequence, the crystal structures are distorted. The crystal structure is triclinic form small A-site cations (Ag and Na) and tetragonal for large A-site cations (K, Rb, Cs and NH4). Upon heating, the orbital ordering melts into a distordered state with higher symmetry. The proposed experiment aims to study the local structure in ACrF3 and ACuF3 over the order-disorder transition by pair distribution functions (PDFs) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The experiment will address the nature of the transition and give insight to electronic and magnetic isotropy present in the compounds.","257":"The stepwise oxidation of methane to methanol is of great interest to the scientific community due to being a promising method to upgrade methane to high-value chemicals as well as providing a possible solution to the environmental concerns that arise from methane flaring. The reaction typically proceeds through three steps: activation of the system by oxidation, methane reaction, and extraction of the produced methanol with steam, where typical systems include various copper-ion-exchanged microporous zeolites. Recently, some studies have ventured beyond the need for a zeolitic support and have experimented with copper supported on less acidic and mesoporous structures such as SBA-15 and amorphous silica as viable systems for methane activation.

The main adsorption sites for As(V) are defective sites in the Zr cluster of UiO-66. However, the more toxic and neutral As(III) cannot be effectively removed from water. Through our post-synthetic modification strategy, we have doped UiO-66 with iron, which in turn facilitates the polymerization of dopamine inside the pores. We have found that As(III) is oxidized in the iron-doped UiO-66\/polydopamine which leads to an increased selectivity for As(III). This makes this material a promising adsorbent for total As from water sources with mixed As(III) and As(V) contamination. We will use X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the Fe, Zr and As K-edge to fully characterize the as-synthesized materials, and to gain insight into the oxidation\/adsopriton mechanism. ","261":"The Pt-like behavior of Mo and W carbides has made them promising catalysts for various applications including valorization of CO2. Proposed here are XAS-XRD studies of model, well-defined, two-dimensional (2D) vacancy-ordered carbides (i-MXenes) that aim to unlock potential of these materials for CO2 conversion reactions. Combined in situ XAS\/XRD experiments under reactant atmospheres will help establishing the fundamental stability region and surface properties of Mo and W-based i-MXenes. This knowledge will guide the pretreatment conditions of these materials, and their rational application in catalytic reactions with oxygenated species. Finally, a route for obtaining defunctionalized surfaces of i-MXenes will pave the way for the development of effective protocols for the atomically-precise anchoring of transition metals onto the ordered vacancies in i-MXenes, to further engineer their properties for applications in heterogeneous catalysis.","262":"Cobalt supported on heteroatom-doped carbon has been found to be an attractive class of catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch-Synthesis (FTS). However, due to often ill-defined Co\/C catalysts, the exact interactions between heteroatoms such as N, S or P incorporated into the carbon support on the active cobalt phase and thus on catalyst performance and deactivation remain opaque. By combining a specifically developed heteroatom doping approach with a literature-proven colloidal Co nanoparticle (NP) synthesis, we prepared a series of well-defined and highly comparable doped (N, S, P) and non-doped carbon supported Co model catalysts, that we aim to utilize to gain insights on metal-support interactions during FTS. Thus, combined operando XRD and XAS studies will be conducted to determine the influence of N, S and P doping on the chemical state, phase (fcc\/hcp ratio) and dispersion of Co NP during reduction and longer periods on stream under industrial relevant FTS conditions.","264":"In supported-metal catalysts, the interface between metal and support acts as an active site where adsorbed gas molecules on metal and support can react.\r\nIn our recent research, we developed ZrO2 cluster on MgO support as a reservoir of monodentate formate which is essential for methanol production during\r\nCO2 hydrogenation via liquid-phase atomic layer deposition. However, the deposited metal species on ZrO2 cluster predominantly determined the activity and\r\nselectivity of the catalyst. The proposed project aims to understand which transition metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, or Fe) preferentially stabilize unstable monodentate formate in the identical metal-ZrO2 cluster structure and finally lead to the production of methanol. Specifically, operando characterization of catalysts with metals deposited on ZrO2 clusters prepared with atomic precision will allow us to identify the structure of catalysts and link the distinct selectivity to intrinsic properties of the deposited metal.","265":"Pd-Ga-based catalysts are promising for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, exhibiting superior activity and stability compared to Cu-based catalysts. Although\r\nPd performs poorly in this reaction, adding a second metal such as Ga leads to a drastic improvement in the catalytic activity and selectivity, possibly due to\r\nmodification of the electronic and\/or geometric local structure of Pd. However, there is still limited knowledge about the active sites in these bimetallic Pd systems. This proposal aims to gain insight into the structural dynamics of bimetallic Pd-GaOx\/SiO2 catalysts for the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol under an H2 pre-treatment and under reaction conditions. We propose operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), combined with differential pair distribution analysis (d-PDF) of X-ray total scattering data to shed light on the atomic-to-the-nanoscale structure of this complex system.","266":"Dypingite is a poorly investigated magnesium hydroxy-hydrated carbonate with a nominal composition of Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2\u00b7xH2O, where x = 5\u20138. It is a naturally occurring mineral that sequestrates effectively heavy metals from water. To understand phenomena behind the material physical & chemical behaviour, the detailed comprehension of its crystal structure is indispensable. The main goal of the proposed study is to follow temperature-induced structural changes occurring in samples of natural and synthetic dypingite, as well as of newly identified phase, with the similar structural and functional properties (hereafter referred to as UK). The samples will be investigated with temperature-dependent in situ (high-resolution) synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), coupled with total scattering analysis and mass spectrometry (MS). The obtained results are expected to provide the better understating of structural and functional properties of both studied compositions.","267":"recycling methods have become essential as a circular economy displaces linear economic pathways. However, the current technology suffer from low gold kinetics and capacities and industry searches for new kinds of adsorbents. To embrace this new challenge, metal organics frameworks (MOFs) have the potential to become great adsorbents for extracting gold from e-waste leachate, due to their porous nature and high surface areas. In an attempt to design a MOF for gold recovery from aqueous solution, a post-synthetic modification strategy was proposed to allow the introduction of different amine adsorption sites. The host material was chosen to be MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 due to the relatively high chemical stability of the MOF, high surface area and large pore windows which allow the diffusion of the amines but also gold to the bulk.","268":"We recently propose a new anode material, a Li-fluoride garnet (Na3Fe2Li3F12), with pseudocapacitive properties, and no irreversible capacity loss for lithium-ion capacitor. Despite evidence from electrochemical studies the pseudo-capacitive nature has not definitely been proven, due to the absence of information about redox chemistry, changes in structure and microstructure, which would allow to distinguish, e.g., between pseudocapacitive or conversion-type behaviour. The aim of this experiment is, therefore, to identify and track changes in structure, lattice parameter, and oxidation states, as well as potential strain causing amorphization during cycling by using operando XRD in combination with EXAFS and PDF. The results will provide unique quantitative data on the structural response of Cryolithionite under electrochemical load in a Li-ion capacitor, hence, open the door for the systematic further improvement of this novel class of material pushing the field of Li-ion capacitors.","269":"Zirconium based metal-organic frameworks featuring the highly stable hexanuclear zirconium-oxo cluster have gained increasing interest for various applications in water decontamination. The Zr cluster offers strong binding sites for various pollutants including As(V) and organic contaminants such as organophosphate pesticides. Here, we propose an alternative approach to form amorphous metal-organic structures featuring high porosity and high density of Zr6 clusters. The formed Zr clusters and their spatial arrangement in the polymer matrix are studied using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and pair distribution function analysis.","270":"The direct conversion of CO2 with hydrogen to methanol under mild conditions is a much-coveted reaction to address the crisis of climate and energy crises.\r\n Copper is a selective catalyst it only operates at relatively high pressures and temperatures, it also has an optimum particle size, not easily maintained over repeated cycles. Zn-promoted Pd is regarded as a potential contender at milder conditions. In addition, smaller particles can be used yielding greater atom economy may be achieved. Metal-organic frameworks are ideal substrates for nanoconfining catalyst nanoclusters, which is the approach we have taken.\r\n However to understand where the catalyst activity arises from a deep understanding into the electronic characteristics of the catalyst, particularly in operando conditions must be developed. We will probe the chemical state and coordination environment of Pd and Zn during reaction, using XAS, while collecting diffraction patterns to monitor support integrity.","273":"We propose to study the active state of 0.5 and 5 wt% Ru on \u03b3-Al2O3 at typical NO oxidation conditions for industrial fertilizer production. Hardly any literature reports exist on catalytic oxidation of NO at high concentrations and pressure, but our research proves that Ru on \u03b3-alumina is a promising catalyst for NO oxidation with water, 4 bar pressure and high NO concentration. Compared to ambient condition performance, the ruthenium catalyst shows promising NO conversions at higher pressure and lower temperature. We therefore want to perform an in-situ investigation on how ruthenium in ambient and 4 bar of pressure. XAS-XRD in combination with mass spectrometry is an excellent combination for studying the local Ru environment in these catalysts at industrially relevant conditions.","274":"The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted a lot of attention over the past 10 years. The coupling of Cu with metal oxides offers great\r\n opportunities for this goal. In our group, we established a synthetic methodology, called colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) which allows the tuning of the\r\n morphology and thickness of Cu|MOx nanoparticles with different shell thicknesses from monolayers to tens of nm. We have discovered that spherical Cu@AlOx\r\n are active for CO2RR but, more importantly, stable during the reaction, which is opposite to what is observed for spherical copper nanoparticles alone. ","275":"The direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol offers the potential to convert a major greenhouse gas into a useful energy carrier, yet its industrial implementation is hampered by the limited stability and selectivity of the traditionally employed Cu-based catalysts. Reducible metal oxides, for instance indium oxide, have shown promising catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. However, their active sites, the prevailing reaction pathways, and the deactivation mechanisms are understudied so far. Here, we will use systematically modified indium oxide nanoparticles (via structural doping) as well-defined materials to gain\r\natomic level understanding of the functioning catalyst at different stages (active and deactivated).","277":"In this project, by combining quick X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, we aim to probe dynamic changes to the\r\nspeciation and local environment of distinct Cu (isolated atoms or nanoparticles) supported on activated carbon (AC) in the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction.\r\nThe unique capabilities of SNBL-BM31 allow for monitoring of the metal active sites in the catalyst to complement our previous ex situ investigations towards\r\nderiving superior design guidelines.","278":"Recently, it was discovered that the presence of manganese (Mn) in cobalt (Co)-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts can shift the selectivity of products from\r\n traditional FT products to long chain alcohols in syngas mixtures (CO+H2). Using surface organometallic chemistry, which has proven effective for synthesizing\r\n model catalysts for various reactions, we created Mn-doped Co nanoparticles on TiO2 with tailored surfaces and interfaces to investigate the origin of this Mn\r\n effect. We wish to use ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to understand the interplay between Co and Mn. By combining in situ XAS with other\r\n spectroscopic, microscopic, and physico-chemical techniques, and by linking to catalytic data, we hope to better comprehend the Mn effect. As Mn has gained\r\n attention as a promoter in various catalytic systems, this study is of interest to a broader audience in heterogeneous catalysis.\r\n","279":"The proposed experiment aims to investigate the crystal structure and disorder in the local structure of a carbon-modified MgB2 hydrogen storage material with enhanced performance compared to traditional MgB2. The goal is to quantify the carbon integration in the crystal structure and the impact it has on local distortions of both the starting material and the hydride. In addition, we want to study the kinetics of the hydrogenation reaction. The modifications imposed by carbon significantly increase the hydrogen binding energy associated with the initial physisorption, pushing the material closer to applications. The aim is to understand the origin of the enhanced performance of carbon-modified MgB2, and create design principles to improve the performance further. Ultimately, the goal is to prepare competitive materials for commercial hydrogen storage applications.","280":" The goal of this proposal is to study metal uptake in metal-organic frameworks from waste-water and other industrial solution produce. The proposal is a part of the project financed by the Research Council of Norway on metal separation and recovery with MOFs, MOFsorbMET. Functionalized Zr-based MOF samples with adsorbed metal ions of interest will be pressed into pellets and investigated with EXAFS and XRD. From the local structure around the metals we can infer the adsorption sites in these compounds. Furthermore, the dependence of the local structure on the adsorption parameters will be investigated and optimal conditions for the critical metals recovery by functionalised Zr- based MOFs will be established. The knowledge of metal-binding site on MOFs is also highly relevant for fields such as catalysis, sensors, gas separation etc.","281":"The synthesis of single atom catalysts (SACs) has undergone a lot of development due to their unique characteristics, which merge features of both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. While the majority of SACs have relatively low loadings (~ <2 wt% metal), high-density (HD) SACs are far less explored. This proposal aims to advance the field of HD-SACs by using two different polymerisation-based approaches for the synthesis of these catalysts. Employing 1,10-Phenanthrolin-5,6-dione as a ligand we are able to produce a library of HD-SACs with different metals. Alternatively, upon synthesis of a porphyrin polymer support and a subsequent metal coordination we are able to produce conductive HD-SACs. Our proposed synchrotron work will investigate the electronic configurations of the HD-SACs libraries we generate, using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES)","282":"This proposal aims at studying the speciation, oxidation state and local environment of Pt and Ga in several \r\nPt-Ga-Si-Al2O3 catalysts active in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

The outcomes of this proposal will enable to rational design the highly efficient catalysts for COx hydrogenation to oxygenates.","284":"Liquid metal nanoparticles (LM NPs), combining metallic and liquid properties, hold promise in diverse fields such as biomedicine, electronics, and catalysis. Yet, their formation chemistry is poorly understood, hindering NP design. In recent years, our group contributed to fill this knowledge gap, showcasing Ga NPs as CO2 reduction catalyst. Still, selectivity could be enhanced with greater compositional and structural tunability. We have recently pioneered a method to synthesize a library of Ga-based multimetallic NPs enclosing a crystalline M-Ga core (M=Cu, Ag, Au, Fe, Co, Sn) within liquid Ga NPs. Yet, questions about solid nucleation within a liquid NP and their interfacial behavior persist. Ex-situ investigations face limitations due to Ga\u2019s propensity for oxidation.

As the chemistry of these compounds is yet to become mature, very little is known about\r\ntheir behavior in batteries. Their cycling mechanism presumably involving redox process at TM site is still relatively unexplored. Furthermore, the Na analogues of\r\nthese antiperovskites are not described in the literature. Thus, this experiment will focus on elucidating the main structural differences in the reaction mechanism\r\nfor a selection of Li- and Na-based antiperovskites as a function of the chalcogenide present in the structure, applied cycling rates and charge\/discharge capacity\r\nusing operando XRD, PDF and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.","287":"In this project, by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements, we aim to probe the dynamic electronic, structural, and morphological evolution of the active metal and promoter phases in CuFe@ZrO2 catalytic systems used for higher alcohol synthesis from CO2.

In contrast to liquid electrolyte \u2013 based battery, the understanding of reaction mechanism of FeS2 as cathode material in all solid-state Li\/Na battery is still in doubt. Therefore, we use a novel operando set-up, which we developed in cooperation with beamline scientists from BM31, to study the phase transformation, microstructure evolution of FeS2, and change of oxidation of Fe during different electrochemical driven condition in solid-state batteries under dynamic and static stack pressure via XRD, EXAFS, XANES, and PDF to provide a new understanding on phase and microstructural evolution as well as mechanical degradation as a function of capacity utilization and applied current.","289":"Rare earth halides are a chemical playground with materials applicable in multiple research areas.

In order to understand the difference between \"good\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d catalysts depending on the surface dopants and additives, we plan to carry out in-situ and operando XAS studies during PDH and subsequent regeneration tests using a series of Pt-Ga systems with tailored surface sites as model catalysts prepared via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). Repeating the cycles of PDH and regeneration will allow us to identify the roles of dopants and additives on catalyst productivity and stability by amplifying the spectra differences.","293":"This project aims to combine X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements to probe the electronic and structural evolution of active metal and promoter phases in CoFe@ZrO2 catalytic systems used for higher alcohol synthesis from CO2.

Our preliminary experiments indicated that Li2MnSeO shows high working potential while Li2FeSeO provides high capacity. However, further improvements of these materials are impeded by the lack of understanding of their mechanism during electrochemical cycling in LIB. As the structure evolution upon cycling can be elucidated by the combination of ex situ and operando measurements, we expect to gain deeper insights into the de\/lithiation mechanism of AP cathodes. ","295":"Ni-based heterogeneous catalysts have attracted attention because of their relatively low cost and intriguing structure-sensitive effects. However, the study into size effect below 2 nm is still lacking since the preparation of sub-2 nm metallic Ni is extremely challenging. Via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) method, we have successfully synthesized a series of evenly size-distributed Ni nanoparticles (Ni-NPs) on Al2O3 with the average size from 1.4 nm to 4.3 nm. By conducting ex situ as well as in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments, we can obtain insight into how the support can stabilize the small size Ni-NPs, and identify the speciation of these Ni catalysts especially under working state. With the combination of in situ XAS with other spectroscopic, microscopic and physico-chemical characterization techniques, as well as the evaluation results on these materials, we will have promising approach to the understanding of the Ni-NPs size effect in CO2 hydrogenation.","296":"The main objective is to investigate the phase, microstructure and elastic strain evolution in Si-anode based solid-state batteries (SSBs) as a function of the applied stack pressure as well as the charge-discharge rate by using operando XRD using our newly developed operando set-up at the BM31. Si is one of the most promising anode materials due to its high specific capacity. Although SSBs utilizing Si show attractive application prospects, current results are still in an infant state. In particular, the phase evolution, comprising amorphization and re-crystallization during charge and discharge, as well as the actually amount of Si utilization, which is expected to by significant influenced by stack pressure, are lacking in understanding. This study will shed light on the underlying processes taking place during operation and will therefore propel the battery field toward engineered silicon anodes that meet the requirements for large-scale adoption of SSBs.","297":"This proposal aims to investigate the effects of nitridation on the structural transformation of mixed metal oxides, and to determine how structural and electronics changes relate to catalytic activity during ammonia decomposition.

In-situ XAS-XRD studies, in combination with mass spectrometry, will allow us to gain insights into how the catalyst composition and structure influence the catalytic activity and stability during ammonia decomposition at relevant conditions, including the metal nitride formation when exposing the catalyst to ammonia at elevated temperatures.   ","298":"Oxygenases are known to be excellent catalysts in C-H oxidation reactions, and are therefore good inspiration when designing new catalysts. Hybrid materials, more specifically metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have shown potential to be used as catalysts, since they are highly tunable in terms of both chemistry and structure. Thus, we have synthesized new bioinspired Zr-based MOFs, and post-synthetically incorporated new enzyme-mimicking linkers, as well as copper cations. We have experimental evidence that suggest two copper sites inside of the MOFs, but their redox properties, as well as their chemical microenvironment are yet to be understood. This proposal therefore aims at combining in-situ XAS and XRD during redox cycles containing a purging\/reduction\/oxidation\/reaction steps, to investigate those questions. XANES and EXAFS will be used to better understand the local environment around Cu (including Cu-oxo species and\/or intermediates) at the various stages of the redox cycle.","299":"Developing stable, highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction is necessary to make water electrolysis economically viable. The current state-of-the-art catalyst, IrO2, is far too expensive and cheaper materials must be utilized. Through a novel synthesis route, we have developed a Y2Ru2O7 pyrochlore which outperforms IrO2 in terms of activity. However, it suffers from stability issues and poor conductivity. Doping the pyrochlore with Pb, Sr or Zn may result in increased Ru-O-Ru orbital overlap, which can both improve the conductivity and the stability of the material. Performing in-situ measurements of the bond lengths as well as the oxidation state during electrochemical operation will reveal how stable the doped electrocatalysts are under actual operation. The most suitable dopant can therefore be chosen to solve the stability issues preventing Y2Ru2O7 from replacing IrO2 as the state-of-the-art OER catalyst.","300":"Metal nanoparticle catalysts dispersed on the surface of a perovskite oxide support show great promise in solid-state electrochemical devices for energy\r\nconversion and electrification of chemical processes involving hydrogen.

However, the selectivity and the yield to methanol of this process are low. To maximize turnover per metal site, we desire structures where every or most metal sites are exposed on a surface. Metal-organic frameworks emerged as an attractive template to derive nanostructured metal oxide particles dispersed in a porous carbon matrix. In this work, we synthesized metal oxide-derived Cu-doped Ce\/Zr mixed cluster in UiO-66 with various Ce\/Zr metal ratios. The controlled pyrolysis helps to avoid sintering of the formed metal oxides, and we expect the Cu species to be well dispersed in the support structure. However, the structure of the materials has not yet elucidated. In order to draw a correlation between the catalytic performance and the structure, the characterization of Ce-Zr, Cu-Cu, Cu-Zr, and Cu-Ce interactions are crucially required.","302":"Noble metal catalysts are essential for heterogeneous catalysis.

Specifically, the state-of-the-art operando XAS at SNBL will allow us to identify how noble metal ions re-disperse during calcination and reduction processes and to better understand the essential role that surface carbonyl ligands have proven to play in our composites. This insight is of utmost importance to turn our carbonyl modification strategy into a general tool for the synthesis of supported noble metal catalysts with maximized metal utilization.","303":"Isomorphous incorporation of Cu(II) into a SAPO-34 framework allows for isolated active sites, which are active towards a range of catalytic reactions (such as deNOx and CO2-reduction). However, prolonged exposure to the gaseous precursors have shown that the catalytic activity decreases. Decreasing the diffusion distances of the gasses (by reducing the particle size) have demonstrated an improved catalytic activity and a slower decrease in catalytic activity. Shorter diffusion distances may prevent clogging of the porous structure and reduce the risk of poisoning the active site. Measuring the Cu K-edge in-situ for different diffusion conditions will reveal how the Cu(II) active sites changes during operation. Comparing the change in the active sites to the change in catalytic activity could therefore help decide how to design these catalyst to make them more active and more durable.

For that\npurpose, we want to use the micro Laue set-up available on BM32 beamline associated with a polychromatic beam (5-22 keV) of 500 x 500 nm2: first, in-plane\nmappings of 100 microns x 100 microns size with a step of 1 micron will be realize, and second depth-resolved maps will be acquired along 60 \u03bcm in-plane and 10\n\u03bcm out-of-plane using the DAXM technique developed on the beamline to extract information through the thickness of the coating.","309":"Ceramic materials are typically elastic and brittle at room temperature, lacking ductility due to limited dislocation mobility. However, zirconia-based ceramics,\nespecially those doped with ceria, can display plasticity via a martensitic phase transformation (tetragonal to monoclinic) similar to transformation induced plasticity\n(TRIP) in shape memory alloys. This offers significant strengthening potential, with some exhibiting around one percent plastic deformation prior to fracture and\nreduced defect sensitivity. Here, we employ Laue microdiffraction and in-situ compression of ceria-doped zirconia micropillars to study this phenomenon. By\ninducing through stress (tetragonal to monoclinic) and reversing the phase transformation (monoclinic to tetragonal), we aim to understand its mechanisms and assess\nphase recoverability by in-situ compression and heating cycles of ceria-doped zirconia micropillars.","310":"For the development of efficient \u03bcdisplays, CEA-Leti is developing a new \u201cInGaN\u201d substrate. This new substrate is made of a 200 nm InGaN layer which is patterned\ninto 5 \u03bcm mesas. The patterning allows strain relaxation of the InGaN layer, which is the main goal of this substrate. A previous macroscopic study, in our lab, of the\nIn-plane lattice parameter versus temperature has enabled us to highlight that a second relaxation occurs during the annealing.This relaxation of the InGaN layer\nneeds to be characterized at a sub-micron scale to better understand the mechanisms of this relaxation. In-situ strain relaxation of InGaN mesa measured by \u03bc-Laue\nwill help us to better understand the relaxation mechanisms just after the patterning and also what phenomena of relaxation locally happen during the annealing.\u03bc-\nLaue in-situ with a beam size around 0.5 \u03bcm would appear to be the appropriate experiment to characterise and understand the relaxation of this InGaN layer.","311":"We wish to study the properties of ferroelectric domains and domain walls in thin film of LiTaO3.

The combination with the rainbow-filter technique will provide a quantitative strain measurement at relevant locations, to be compared with the Raman measurements. This series of experiments will bring a solid and complementary proof of giant strain modulation in our samples. Indeed, up to now this effect is only evaluated in an indirect fashion via Raman spectroscopy (see in the following). This experiment can be expanded in a close future to the case of GeSn, a forefront group four alloy for optoelectronics, with the ambitious goal to realize the first ultra wide band, wavelength tuneable, group four laser.","313":"We propose a disruptive approach based on \u03bcLaue diffraction to study the nature and the distribution statistics of defects in semiconductor materials.

Hence mechanical deformation can lead to interesting modifications of magnetic ordering. Recently the group at University of California at Santa Barbara has observed a decrease in net magnetization after plastic deformation of compressed ingots or ground powders of the Heusler alloys MnAu2Al. These experiments have clearly evidenced the role of plastic deformation on magnetic properties in this intermetallic alloy; the converse could also be a potent effect wherein long-range magnetic order could influence the energy landscape for dislocations and their mobility. This raises the interesting question of the impact of long-range magnetic order on plastic properties and dislocation dynamics. This proposal aims at a thorough investigation of the initial stages of plastic deformation in Heusler micropillars using a combination of microcompression and microLaue diffraction.","317":"Whiskers (long single crystal filaments of micro\/submicrometer diameter) growth on Sn coating is a major technological threat for electronic\/electrical devices.

In that context, studying the stress distribution of the coating before and after irradiation is of prime interest. However, the prediction of the coating plasticity and mechanical behaviour in the system Cr coating\/Zr-alloy substrate is an open issue that requires numerical simulation. The objective of the experiment is to quantify the stress redistribution induced by the irradiation (of the coating) in order to validate numerical simulations. For that purpose, 2D and 3D elastic strain maps (within the Cr coating), built from Laue images, are acquired for different ion irradiation doses. For that experiment, a polychromatic beam (5-22 keV) and highly focused (500x500 nm2) beam, together with an efficient 2D detector, is required.","321":"Piezoelectric semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been researched as the building blocks for various energy transducing applications.

Theoretically possible with a proper choice of Zn fraction, it is practically impossible to achieve\r\nover large areas. Thus, mismatch induced strain must be carefully evaluated and its consequences for dislocation generation anticipated. Here we propose to use a\r\nmicroLaue diffraction to access in depth strain profiling of HgCdTe\/CdZnTe single layer samples with different strain ranging from compressive to tensile. The experiment will be coupled to a flexion setup for additional quantitative information upon the kinetics of plastification in this material system.

In this proposal, we aim to investigate in situ samples and operando cells to characterize the structural and chemical interfacial degradation between the electrodes (Li metal anode and sulfur cathode) and the solid electrolyte using X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) and absorption\/phase contrast tomography.

Over the last decade, attention has come to the ionic and molecular species present prior to nucleation and the role they play in the formation of the solid material. In the proposed experiment we want to systematically investigate how the atomic structure of precursor and prenucleation clusters influences the formation mechanism in hydrothermal synthesis of tungsten oxide nanoparticles. By using in situ Pair Distribution Function analysis, we will track the changes in the atomic structure before and after nucleation and map this relation. The atomic structure before nucleation can be controlled by adjusting the pH of the solution.","366":"We will use operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRDCT) to study the progress of deactivation in hollow catalyst spheres specially designed to allow their entire volume to be accessible to reactants.

At present, the capacity of NIBs is too low for practical applications and limited by the cathode. However, some Mn-based cathode materials have shown large capacities at voltages above the conventional Mn3+\/4+ redox couple, attributed to reversible redox reactions involving O2\u2212. Here, we propose to measure the O K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for two NIB cathodes, Na0.67[Mg0.28Mn0.72]O2 and Na4\/7Mn6\/7O2, at several states of charge and determine to what extent the oxidation state and coordination environment of O changes, particularly at high voltages.

This proposal aims to reveal the mechanisms of sulphur poisoning and regeneration of Cu-CHA zeolites at the molecular level, monitoring the electronic structure and local environment of active Cu centres by element-selective X-ray absorption and X-ray emission spectroscopies (XAS and XES) during the in situ adsorption and desorption of sulphur. Obtained results will be crucial to optimise regeneration procedures for the catalysts, increasing thus their efficiency. ","379":"Non-random disorder in functional materials is of particular interest as it involves a new dimension for tuning materials\u2019 properties. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), an emerging class of porous materials, demonstrate complicated non-random structural features and are proven to have rich applications. However, only very few studies have been done on the non-random patterns in mixed-metal MOFs, and even fewer succeeded to analyze the bulk of the material rather than several isolated crystallites. For bimetallic MOFs hosting long metal chains, such as MOF-74, no bulk information on the metal distribution is available to date. To address this problem, we propose to determine the sequence patterns in the metal-oxo chains of mixed-metal Co\/Cd- and Co\/Pb-MOF-74 using bulk-sensitive element-selective EXAFS spectroscopy. The result will enable the understanding of the sequence-property relationships for the MOFs with non-random disorders and tune their syntheses for practical applications.","380":"Chemical oscillators are systems in which the concentration of one or more chemical species undergoes a periodic time evolution. The periodic behaviour of the system is driven by an irreversible chemical reaction and is made possible by a series of competing chemical processes that may depend on an element that can exist in different oxidation states. Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) type oscillators exploit bromine chemistry and a metal redox switch such as the Fe(II)\/Fe(III) couple to achieve periodicity. The aim of our project is to follow an iron-dependant BZ-type oscillator by means of coupled XAS\/UV-Vis detection and to identify the nature and concentration time evolution of the key species through a multivariate analysis of the spectroscopic data.

Based on the differences observed between the cellular emissive behaviour of Pt2L2 and L we initially hypothesized that Pt2L2 reaches the nucleus of cells, and accumulates in the nucleoli where it binds to unconventional DNA structures called G-quadruplex. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Pt2L2 breaks partially inside cells, releasing the Pt(II) centre and ligand L, which could follow different cellular fates. To obtain a complete picture of the cellular trafficking of Pt2L2, we intend to use nanofocused XRF at ID16A to map Pt in cells treated with a range of concentrations of our metal complex for different times. Comparing these maps with the microscopy images previously obtained will be key to understand the mechanism of action of Pt2L2.","385":"Controlled-release fertilizers based on the dispersion of eco-friendly P sources \u2013 Bay\u00f3var rock and Struvite \u2013 on a polysulfide matrix were investigated for improving the delivery of both P and S. The studied polysulfides have a multifunctional role, helping P solubilization and providing S for plants after being oxidized in soil to sulfate. Previous results showed a superior sulfate formation from polysulfides than elemental sulfur (S8), and that P stimulates the oxidation of S. Yet, little is known from literature about the biodegradation of this polymer and the dynamics in soil when in the presence of P sources. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the S species formed in soil by the oxidation of the polysulfide and S8, to better understand differences in oxidation steps and transformations from both these sources.

In the case of a whole organism, CNPs have to be able to cross various biological barriers (i.e. blood brain barrier) in order to be effective on-site (i.e. endothelial cell or brain cells). Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most common animal models used to test potential therapeutic strategies: we here propose to assess whether the CNPs, ingested by the Drosophila fly, are distributed in different tissues\/organs of this live model organism, and how the Ce oxidation state changes based on its distribution, by means of  Ce-LIII-edge \u03bcXANES spectroscopy at ID21.\r\n","387":"Porous materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) capable of reducing both the cost and energy intensity of storing alternative fuels such as hydrogen and natural gas are critically needed in transitioning to a carbon-neutral energy cycle.

GCMC simulations of its adsorption isotherms suggest that CO2 and N2O interact with PhTz+ in end-on and side-on mode, respectively. In situ PXRD on both MOFs at different temperatures a) dosing CO2 or N2O in static conditions will allow clarifying the role of PhTz+ suggested by the calculations and rationalizing the observed temperature-dependent selectivity; b) flowing a CO2\/N2O mixture with the atmosphere v\/v ratio and coupling MS on the exit flow will allow establishing if PhTz+ is involved and the selectivity is temperature-dependent also in dynamic conditions.","434":"Based on previous knowledge on the effects of pre-reducing agents on the reducibility of PdO\/Al2O3 catalysts and on the properties of the supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs), this proposal aims to investigate by High-Q XRD\/PDF in situ measurements the isothermal reduction of PdO\/Al2O3 catalysts in water in the presence of different reducing agents. The results will contribute to establish the thermodynamics (activation energy) and kinetics (mechanism) of liquid phase PdO reduction as a function of the reducing agents.

Recently, transition metal oxide catalysts containing boron have gained attraction for their high catalytic activity in OER. We aim to investigate the structure-property relations of different Co\/Ni-B oxides for OER. We focus on the structure evolution of these highly active catalysts on the atomic scale, starting from amorphous precursors via intermediate structures to crystalline materials by in situ total scattering experiments and subsequent pair distribution function analysis. To achieve this, we aim to perform temperature- and time-dependent in situ heating experiments at the beamtime ID15A.

Due to the 0.6 K difference in their b.p. conventional distillation is unviable. Adsorption-based separation by porous materials is less costly but needs a selectivity vs. diffusion kinetics trade-off. In this context we studied the known covalent organic framework (COF) [(TAM)(BDA)] (COF-300, TAM = tetrakis(4- aminophenyl)methane, BDA = terephthaldehyde) [1]. BEN and CH static adsorption showed step-like isotherms, typical of flexible pores, with higher adsorption capacity for BEN; dynamic adsorption unveiled a higher BEN retention time, suggesting stronger host-BEN interactions. High-resolution PXRD in situ-dosing BEN or CH at given vapour pressures will allow disclosing\r\nthe purported flexibility and the BEN\/CH preferential adsorption sites. This will help rationalizing the role of flexibility and host-guest interactions in BEN and CH adsorption for COF-300 and new-generation adsorbents.","441":"The major objective of the proposal is to pinpoint the positions and geometry of both active and inactive copper species and elucidate whether differences in activity between systems scale only with the density of active species or are the result of structural (topological) differences between zeolite frameworks.

The operando measurements of the PdHx lattice parameters with wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) allow the quantification of H atoms inserted into the Pd lattice and thus, help to resolve contribution from hydrogen absorption. This experiment thus aims at (i) exploring the H\/Pd ratio dependency on the potential, (ii) distinguishing the two distinctive Pd hydride phases: the \u03b1-phase at low hydrogen content and the lattice-expanded \u03b2-phase at high hydrogen concentrations, (iii) showing that the Pd lattice can be saturated at low potentials, and (iv) investigating the stability of the \u03b2-phase.","446":"In the search for the next generation of high energy density Li-ion batteries, solid electrolytes (SE) are a valid alternative to the current liquid electrolytes.

For this, we have begun tuning the properties through the post-synthetic reductions of Cr(pyz)2I2 by replacing the chloride ligands with its larger congener iodide. Moreover, partial reduction of these systems opens a gateway to mixed-valence states. To overcome the challenges faced with these materials in correlating their properties with both the solid-state and electronic structure, this proposal aims to shed light on structure-property relationships of this system through a series of partially and fully reduced networks through the collective techniques of high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).\r\n","449":"X-ray can be used as a tool to induce modifications in molecular materials.1 Interestingly, some recent studies have shown that X-ray can also induce reversible switching, for instance low spin to high spin conversion on Fe(II) metal centers in spin crossover (SCO) complexes,2,3 or an electron transfer (ET) between Fe and Co ions through the CN bridge.4 In this proposal, we would like to study an other class of switchable compounds based on [W(CN)8]4- units using X-ray as the source of excitation.

Interestingly, all experimental evidence suggests that the Ru sites are identical with an oxidation state of +2.5 and not a mixture of oxidation states +3 and +2. Surprisingly, this compound has never been studied by XANES and XMCD. Therefore, in this study, we propose to (1) directly assess the established conclusion of two identical Ru sites in the Creutz-Taube ion, and (2) determine the Ru magnetization from L2,3-edge XAS and XMCD at the ID12 beamline.

This is possible for chiral magnetic materials displaying the magnetoelectric effect, where the absence of inversion symmetry leads to efficient coupling of local electric fields to the molecular magnetic moment. This magnetoelectric coupling leads to magnetochiral dichroism (MXD). To achieve a sizeable magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for efficient manipulation of molecular magnetic moments by electric fields, strong spin-orbit coupling in the targeted material is required.

It is mainly produced through an energy demanding process, named steam cracking. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, implementing a catalyst, is considered the most attractive alternative route to the conventional steam cracking. Fe-based catalysts are highly selective for tandem reactions of ethane dehydrogenation (DH) and CO2 reduction (CO2-EDH), even more when they are supported on a NiO containing mixed oxide. As undesired side reactions can decrease selectivity towards the main product, i.e. ethylene, the research challenge in CO2-EDH is to develop catalysts which can selectively cleave the C-H bond and preserve the C-C bond, while in parallel activate CO2, producing CO and oxygen species (O*). The aim of this proposal is to identify in situ the structure of active Fe and Ni sites, along with a potential developed interface, that defines the activity, selectivity and stability.

Employing operando XAS, we propose to study how Zn atom density on the support influences the Zn coordination environments and electronic properties at different reaction temperatures and pressures, and to verify the synergistic activation pathways of CO2 over neighbouring Zn single atoms, as anticipated from our previous kinetic studies.

Studies of the last decades evidence that polar molecules may nonetheless be enclathrated, producing stable solid phases in the presence of clathrate promoters, with the formation of guest-host hydrogen bonds. So far, this phenomenon has been studied only for the common sI, sII, and sH binary clathrates while host-guest hydrogen bonding in HP dense clathrates have not been addressed. Recently, we have synthesised at HP-LT conditions several dense acetone clathrates featuring hydrogen bonging between oxygen of the acetone molecule and a framework oxygen.

Therefore, we intend to investigate how different ligands could influence the growth of CeO2NPs and their subsequently self-assembly.

The mechanisms through which these reaction inhibitions and cocrystal decompositions occur remain entirely unknown, despite our recent efforts to understand them using ex situ crystallographic analyses.

From these measurements we expect to gain additional insight in the large differences in phase behaviour exhibited by Et4NX + glutaric acid mixtures upon changing the halide anions.","543":"Trimetallic carbonyl clusters (M3(CO)12) containing group 8 elements such as iron, ruthenium and osmium are historic molecules in the field of organometallic photochemistry and are known as efficient photocatalysts. While the excited-state behavior M3(CO)12 has been intensively studied with several spectroscopic tools, considering the lack of sensitivity of the spectroscopic methods to the global molecular structure, we believe that the assignments, especially the structural identities of reaction intermediates, reported from previous studies should be further supported by additional experimental evidence obtained with a direct structural probe. Here, we aim to investigate the structural dynamics of the photoreaction of Fe3(CO)12 using time-resolved x-ray liquidography (TRXL), which is directly sensitive to the molecular structure. By doing so, we seek to verify whether the assignments of the reaction pathways reported from the previous literature are valid.","544":"Mononitrosyl complexes of general composition [ML5NO]n\u00b1 (M=transition metal, L=ligand such as F,Cl,Br, CN, etc) can form linkage isomers upon irradiation with light in the visible spectral range. We aim to measure the structure of the MS2 state, corresponding to a nitrosyl linkage isomer, in sodium nitroprusside (Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]2H2O ) after pulsed laser excitation. Based on ultrafast UV\/Vis and infrared spectroscopy, the MS2 state is expected to be occupied within 10 ps. Thus a diffraction experiment with a time resolution of 10-100 ps at room temperature (at room temperature MS2 has a lifetime of 300ns) would prove that SNP has indeed equilibrated in the MS2 minimum after only 10 ps. This experiment would also demonstrate the possibility to capture full structures on single crystals at such a short time scale. ","545":"This proposal aims to study cobalt nanoparticles on different supports exposed to the FT reaction conditions using synchrotron X-ray techniques such as wideangle X-ray scattering (WAXS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). The focus will be on investigating well-defined cobalt FT catalysts, with particular attention to the cobalt particles sintering, their crystallographic structure, chemical coordination environment, and the impact of supporting material.","546":"Syngas synthesis via reverse gas shift reaction is a promising approach to integrate CO2 in industrial processes. Insight into catalyst design is therefore required to develop highly active and selective catalysts that minimize side reactions, such as CO2 methanation. Potassium is an effective promoter for Cu-based catalysts, however, its promotional effect has not been fully elucidated, i.e. the nature of the Cu-K interaction and the reducing effect of K over Cu. The addition of K has led to greatly enhanced activity, selectivity and stability of the Cu catalysts during RWGS reaction, favouring syngas production. The unique capabilities of BM28\/ID26 beamlines allow us to study the evolution of oxidation state and atomic coordination of K and Cu in-situ as a function of the gas feed composition (% of H2) and support material (SiO2 or C). We aim to obtain detailed information concerning the K-Cu interaction, correlating it to the observed performances during RWGS reaction.","547":"We aim to identify crystalline and amorphous phases in samples of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) collected from silicon battery anodes at different stages of lithiation and delithiation. The SEI is regarded as one of the most important but least understood components of Li-ion batteries in view of its complex dynamic behaviour and its effect on battery capacity and stability. The combination of X-ray Raman Scattering (XRS) and X-ray diffraction coupled with Pair Distribution Function analysis (XRD\/PDF) is particularly apt to resolve the composition of SEI samples as it gives complementary chemical and structural insight, and thus address key points such as formation mechanism, reactivity, and transport properties.","548":"Our goal is to provide deeper insights into the MSI of Ir NPs deposited on highly graphitized C and TiO2 during OER conditions and to correlate this information with the resulting catalytic activities. Operando electrochemical QuickXAS studies enable us to identify dynamic behavior of the nature of Ir oxide species and its electronic and geometric interactions (oxidation state, local environment) on two different support materials (MSI) as a function of the applied potential (before, during and after OER). In a two-step synthetic route, Ir NPs will be prepared by a colloidal approach and then immobilized either on the carbon or TiO2 support material. From XAS data recorded at Ir LII\/LIII-edges, linear combination fit and EXAFS analysis will be carried out to understand the potential-resolved dynamic behavior of the chemical state of the Ir NPs (2-4 nm) and the nature of catalytically active oxide phase before, during and after the OER.","549":"We recently reported the first example of thorium\u2013thorium bonding in a crystalline cluster. Crystallography analysis and DFT results show the cluster exhibits a diamagnetic, closed-shell singlet ground state with a valence-delocalized three-thorium-two-electron \u03c3-aromatic bond. The frontier molecular orbitals are predicted to be predominantly 6d in character, with a triplet excited state lying 0.95 eV above the ground state. We therefore propose valence-to-core RIXS studies to directly access these states with high energy resolution. To benchmark our results, measurements on a series of thorium organometallic compounds are also proposed, including classic metallocene molecules that astonishingly have yet to be studied by L3-edge RIXS.","550":"We plan to investigate by in situ XAS a photocatalyst for H2 evolution composed, in the as-formed state, of an amorphous sputtered NiCu thin co-catalyst film on a mesoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. 1a). We propose that the active catalytic sites for H2 evolution are formed in situ by (i) dissolution of the NiCu thin film in the dark in the aqueous reaction phase, followed by (ii) Ni and Cu ions re-deposition on TiO2 upon UV illumination. The self-assembled NiCu sites provide efficient and stable photocatalytic H2 evolution. In situ XAS will allow to understand the mechanism of self-assembly of this photocatalytic system and the nature of the active sites for H2 evolution.","552":"A renewable and clean energy economy is a societal challenge that has become one of the main concerns during last decades because of the implication of fossil fuels in global warming and climate change. Artificial photosynthesis is one of the most promising alternatives. In our group, we have prepared the recently reported [FeII(qpy)(H2O)2]2 with the objective of fully understanding the mechanism of the CO2 reduction to CO. Within this context, K\u03b2 XES, HERFD, VtC XES techniques, are powerful techniques that can provide unique mechanistic information of this system, helping for the future design of not only qpy-based, but also other CO2 reduction catalysts.","553":"Transition metal-nitrogen-doped carbons (TMNCs) are an attractive class of systems that shows promise application for the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, despite important advances in the field, some open questions remain about the nature, stability and evolution of the possible metal active sites during CO2RR under static and pulsed potential conditions. Herein, we propose, for the first time, an operando combined a HERFD XANES and XES study targeting the CO2RR active species for a series of TMNCs materials (Co, Cu, Fe and Ni TMNCs), relevant for CO2RR research. The unique structure\/electronic sensitivity of these spectroscopic techniques will be fundamental to have access the finest spectral features characterizing the CO2RR active centers, their reactive intermediates and possible C\/O ligands, allowing us to clarify the main reaction steps and explain the TMNCs catalytic properties.","555":"Electron transfer (ET) and oxygen transfer (OT) reactions often occurs in enzyme catalyzed biological reactions for C-H bond activation and C-C bond cleavage. To follow the track of these type of reaction is very challenging with the conventional spectroscopic techniques. Hence, in the proposed study we plan to investigate on the role of V containing polyoxometalate (also known as heteropolyacids) towards ET-OT reactions with the help of high energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption near edge spectra (HERFD-XANES) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Moreover, the role of ion-exchanged and supported polyoxometalate (POM) will also be investigated during this study. It is also unclear how the POM is re-oxidized in presence of oxidants such as molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, which we would like to find out throughout the proposed experiments.A successful outcome will certianly help other researchers to understand complex reactions.","557":"This proposal aims to solve the structure of a series of new Mn(III)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a flexible structure, as well as investigating their guest sorption properties. The series of new MOFs is related to the well-known MIL-53, which possesses a breathing behaviour. The originality of our series of MOFs, apart from the fact that it is based on Mn(III) metal centres, is that it has alkoxy bridging linkers. It is known that both, the nature of the metal centres and of the bridging linkers have an important influence on the breathing behaviour of MIL-53. We aim at solving the structure of several of those MOFs with linkers of various sizes (EtO-, PrO-, etc.) with the help of variable-temperature X-ray synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments; collecting very good quality diffraction data is mandatory. Furthermore, adsorption of guests and possible flexibility of the structure of the new MOFs will be investigated with respect to various solvents and gasses.","559":"Recently we demonstrated that yttrium forms YN6 and Y2N11 polynitrides at 100 GPa, that feature a unique organization of nitrogen atoms - an anionic N18 macrocycle and a polynitrogen double helix, respectively. However, the polynitride high-pressure chemistry of its III group neighbor, scandium, is still unknown, although being the lightest transition metal, scandium polynitrides are especially promising as high energy density materials (HEDM). Indeed, the theoretical studies predict the formation of high energy density scandium polynitrides at 50-110 GPa with exotic crystal structures. Here, we propose a single-crystal X-ray diffraction  study of the Sc-N system at pressures up to 175 GPa at ID11. The aims of the proposed experiments are a synthesis of new Sc-N compounds at megabar pressure, characterization of their crystal chemistry and behavior upon decompression, tests of theoretical predictions, search for regularities in polynitride chemistry, and discovery of novel HEDM.","560":"The family of octahedral cluster-based solid state compounds exhibits fascinating crystal structures and a wide range of physical properties. This proposal aims at determining the crystal structure of a new nanoribbon-shaped material of the ternary Mo-I-S compound family, using cutting-edge structural solution and refinements tools. The structural results will allow to determine the correlations between crystal and electronic structures, then helping to understand the superconducting and absorption behavior of this low dimensional cluster-based compound.","561":"The bonding concepts in polyhalogen anions is of great interest because of its central importance in chemistry. However, the database of polyhalogen anions is very limited to have a general concept of their chemical bonding, formation laws, and physical properties. At the same time, considering alkali halides is acting as excellent examples of how pressure enriches chemistry and provides ideas for novel optical and energy converting materials, a huge number of theoretical calculations suggest the existence of the exciting world featuring polyhalogen anions. However, very few of them have been experimentally confirmed. Investigation of the alkali halides with polyhalogen anions with unconventional stoichiometry allows not only to develop new high-pressure fundamental chemistry, but also to produce novel materials which often possess important mechanical, optical, electronic, and other physical properties, and could be of interest for potential technological applications.","562":"This experiment aims to apply a novel method to study the mechanism of silicon alloying anode materials for lithium ion batteries at the atomic level using total scattering. A multi-channel collimator will be used to zoom in on the active material inside the working anode and extract high quality pair distribution function data on the amorphous structures at high speed during battery cycling. This will reveal both the detailed mechanism of silicon (de)lithiation and the diffusion kinetics through the thickness of electrode. We will also establish whether these experiments can be done using a conventional coin cell rather than a custom-made cell.","563":"This proposal to establish the details of the crystal structure at low temperatures of the layered oxide chalcogenide Ca2Fe2.6S2O3. This will enable us to correlate the structural evolution with the the unusual change in magnetic ordering that occurs around 70K accompanied also by a change in the resistivity, and relate this to subtle changes in the details of the complex superstructure which results from Fe ion\/vacancy ordering.","564":"Solid-solid transitions occur from room temperature ordered phases to orientationally disordered high-temperature phases that lie at the boundary between liquids and solids. Solid-solid phase-change materials (SSPCMs) can be potentially used for next generation thermal energy storage devices, as they present several advantages over solid-liquid PCMs including safety (no spillage of hot liquid), lower thermal expansion, lower corrosiveness, and no need for encapsulation. Adoption of SSPCMs for practical applications require detailed understanding of both thermodynamic and kinetic disordering. The proposal will investigate two tetrafluoroborate salts with high latent heat of phase transitions. KBF4 and NaBF4 undergo order-disorder transitions at 285 \u2103 and 230 \u2103 with \u0394H =120 J\/g and 70 J\/g, respectively. Variable-temperature powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) will be conducted to elucidate long-range structural changes over many temperature cycling (heating\/cooling).","565":"Metal halide perovskites derivatives of general formula Cs3B2X9 with B= Bi, Sb and X=I, Br have been proposed as possible less toxic and more stable alternatives to lead-containing materials for a wide range of applications from photovoltaics. Despite the huge interest in their physical properties a comprehensive description of their structure, both at the average and local level, and their polymorphism is still lacking, hindering a better understanding of the correlation between structure and properties for these versatile materials.","568":"Intrinsic interstitial defects are thermodynamically favorable in high-temperature synthesized half-Heusler compounds and manipulate the thermoelectric properties (improving electrical conductivity & reducing lattice thermal conductivity). They provide a new pathway to boost thermoelectric performance. Here, NbCoSn & NbCoM0.05Sn (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were synthesized to study the effect of different excessive metals on crystal structure, thermoelectric properties, and to probe correlation between them. To bridge the correlation between interstitial defects and electrical properties of NbCoM0.05Sn, the temperature dependence of interstitial defect site occupation factors in conjunction with transport properties need to be investigated.","569":"Transition metal oxide\/hydroxide catalysts, based on Fe, Co, and Ni, are active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. However, the structure\/property relations are far from understood. In the proposed experiment we want to elucidate the structural changes of NiFe(oxy)hydroxides when used as electrocatalysts under OER. We will use wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) in combination with x-ray total scattering and Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis to obtain in-depth insight on structural changes and rearrangements taking place under applied potential. This information is crucial for further catalyst optimization. ","571":"The alkaline water splitting and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using Co-based electrocatalysts is a promising approach to produce green H2 using electricity from renewable energies. However, detailed operando mechanistic understanding of the catalytic role of Fe and the decisive properties leading to enhanced and stable OER activity are yet missing. In this experiment, we aim to clarify the influence of Fe addition to Co3O4 electrocatalysts on their structural adaptations to the OER conditions using operando high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD). In particular, we will reveal how the composition will determine the reversible (near-surface) restructuring, the microstrain as well as the potential-induced lattice strain. We will investigate promising Co3-xFexO4 electrocatalysts and will contribute to the understanding of decisive interfacial properties to design active, stable electrocatalysts for industrially-relevant alkaline electrolyzers. ","573":"Hydrogen-fuelled anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is a promising energy conversion technology, through which electricity is generated by the hydrogen oxidation. Because it allows for the use of platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts, AEMFC has attracted extensive research attention in recent years. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline medium, especially for PGM-free electrocatalysts, pose challenges for the further development of high-performance AEMFCs. Both hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxide binding energy (OHBE) have been proposed as descriptors of catalytic reactivity. Although several experimental findings can be explained by these two simple theories, there still exist some debate as to the detailed alkaline HOR mechanism. The aim of this proposal is to further advance the understanding of the alkaline HOR mechanism and to offer a new route for rational design of advanced HOR electrocatalysts and beyond.","574":"Improving water desalination required immediate attention. Desalination batteries (DB) provide a low-cost and energy-efficient method to (selectively) remove ions from water using faradaic electrodes. Because DBs are at their infancy, improved understanding is necessary towards their practical implementation. This proposal aims to further the understanding of ion intercalation and degradation phenomena observed in manganese oxide-based DB electrodes by utilizing  operando high-energy X-ray diffraction mapping of flow-by reactors. We will investigate Li and Na manganese oxide ((Li\/Na0.88)Mn2O4) as intercalation electrodes in both baseline ((Li\/Na2SO4) and realistic (synthetic seawater) salt water environments. The results will provide novel information regarding the intercalation mechanism of ions into DB electrodes and their degradation both at the atomic and the full electrode scale towards rational improvements of DBs.","575":"LiNiO2 (LNO) and other isostructural high-Ni compounds are promising cathode materials for Li-ion batteries. Many works have been reported to reduce particle cracking and improve surface chemistry for better electrochemical performance. However, the understanding of local structural change, such as the Ni migration, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experiment to observe the Ni migration during cycling by pair distribution function (PDF) with high-energy X-ray, which will guide us to develop methods to improve the reversibility of Ni migration to achieve better structural stability. It could provide essential knowledge of the mainstream cathode research for Li-lion batteries.","576":"Finding a sufficiently active, stable, and inexpensive catalyst for the anode side of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEM-WE) remains one of the most principal obstacles preventing wider implementation of the concept of Hydrogen economy. Nanostructured Ir-Ru catalysts, containing less than 30 % of expensive Ir, are the possible industrially applicable solution to the problem. The effect of enhanced stability of inexpensive Ru by a small amount of Ir is known, yet still not comprehensively explained. The aim of this high-energy X-ray scattering experiment is to elucidate the complex concentration-dependent interplay between Ir and Ru, which affects the alloy\u00b4s structure, strain and chemical state and is most likely responsible for its high performance. Low-loading catalytic layers, prepared by magnetron co-sputtering, will be probed in operando as part of a functional membrane electrode assembly (MEA) within the recently commissioned WAXS\/SAXS-compatible PEM-WE cell.","578":"Phase transitions induced by an applied magnetic field are rare compared to those caused by changes in temperature, pressure, or composition. In our search for such a transition, we wish to study the field dependence of a temperature-induced phase transition exhibited by CrCl2(pyrazine)2 and probe whether it is possible to induce the transition by field alone. The material can be directly synthesised either in the orthorhombic Immm phase or the tetragonal I4\/mmm phase. As the tetragonal phase exhibits a conductivity three times higher than that of the orthorhombic phase, manipulating the transition between the two phases via field will allow a fine-tuning of the material\u2019s conductive properties that has previously been unachievable. Furthermore, if observed, the presence of a phase transition induced by field alone would shed light on its potential mechanism and applications in molecule-based devices of the future. ","580":"Quantum information processing using molecular systems is of paramount importance within the second quantum revolution, because of efficient addressing of quantum error-corrections. Among these systems hetero lanthanide (Ln) complexes are proposed as quantum gates. Although of great interest these complexes remain very rare and thus very little studied. We have synthesised a new family of pure heterodinuclear Ln complexes. We propose to study the magnetic properties of the individual Ln centres within the heterometallic assembly by X-ray Magnetocircular Dichroism (XMCD). Furthermore, the possible coupling of the local magnetic moments to electric fields, via the magnetoelectric coupling effect, can be exploited to control the Ln gates by external electric fields. We will investigate the occurrence of strong magnetoelectric coupling in these compounds by probing them for a magnetochiral response (X-ray Magnetochiral Dichroism, XMChiD).","581":"Coordination polymers based on octacyanotungstate(IV) and magnetically non-innocent manganese(II) complex cations establish a new class of high-temperature photomagnets with photo-induced magnetic ordering temperatures exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. In this proposal we aim to fully determine the mechanism of the reversible photomagnetic switching in these unique compounds, which seem to be associated with the reversible ligand dissociation at the tungsten center. The XAS\/XMCD measurements seem to be the only technique that enables direct insight into the electronic\/magnetic structure of W, where the photo-induced changes take place. The unequivocal determination of the photoswitching mechanism was not possible using other general techniques such as single-crystal and powder XRD or IR spectroscopy. The new knowledge gained through the implementation of the proposal will enable a rational approach to the design of the 2nd generation of photomagnets working at RT.","582":"A novel family of molecular qubits based on Copper(II) molecules forming an extended 2D structure on graphene will be investigated here at the level of a monolayer deposit in order to evaluate if, in agreement with the reports on bulk, the intermolecular exchange coupling interaction is still mediated by strong VdW forces when a single layer is prepared by thermal sublimation. A temperature dependent XMCD experiment will be used to evaluate the presence of such interaction flanked by an XNLD test to confirm the formation of an ordered layer as locally observed by STM. The demonstration that an ensemble of molecular qubits can be assembled on surface will open additional perspectives for the development of multifunctional hybrid devices for spintronics and quantum computing.\r\n","583":"We have recently demonstrated that supporting IrOx on platinum coated titanium dioxide (IrOx-Pt-TiO2) with only a fraction of the PGM content (39 wt%) generates significantly higher activity (141%) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to commercial IrO2 catalysts. The operando spectroscopy performed at Ir LIII edge suggest that the oxidation state of Ir depends on Ir\/Pt ratio. Underlying reason for this behaviour is revealed when observing the Ir-O bond, i.e. IrOx-Pt-TiO2 is shorter than analogous bonds in commercial unsupported IrO2. This suggests a strong interaction between Ir and Pt, with the possibility of a bimetallic specie forming. However, due to the proximity in energy of Ir and Pt LIII edge, it is not possible to confirm the presence of a intermetallic specie using EXAFS. Performing experiment at Ir and Pt k edge would be essential to establish the interaction between Ir and Pt, and confirm, or exclude, the presence of bimetallic species at the interface.","584":"This proposal deals with the study of the Cr2O3-doped UO2 pellet microstructure evolution at high temperature and as a function of the oxygen partial pressure. We aim to couple XANES U L3 edge and XRD measurements in order to characterize the evolution of UO2 lattice parameter (linked to the Cr and O atoms insertion in the lattice) and to identify the crystalline phases formed in the pellets, especially under the effect of oxidative atmosphere. ","585":"Quantum crystallography (QCr) has become a mature field for advanced electron-density refinement of molecules. It has been shown that physical effects such as polarization and electron correlation can be extracted from an X-ray diffraction experiment separately from each other by using QCr techniques. The ultimate goal, however, is the extraction of relativistic effects, which is much more challenging from both a theoretical method development and experimental perspective as it involves heavy elements with many electrons in the core. In this proposal, we tackle such challenges with combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy and variable-wavelength X-ray diffraction experiments on molecular mercury- and bismuth-based crystals.","586":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the valence state and the local chemical environment of uranium and plutonium gels obtained with reaction of actinide(s) nitrates with citric acid and glycine by X-ray Absorption techniques (EXAFS and HERFD-XANES). More specifically, EXAFS will be conducted in order to probe the Pu and U local environments. Moreover, HERDF-XANES on simple and mixed actinides gels will be used to determine oxidation state of U and Pu. These gels are used as precursors for Solution Combustion Synthesis of mixed actinides oxides. Indeed, gels preparation (glycine\/uranium or citric acid\/uranium ratio...) strongly affect actinide oxides characteristics after combustion. Our objective is to correlate differences observed in powders (oxidation state, residual carbon content) and to initial gel properties.

For such applications, NOx emissions are the only pollutant requiring catalytic aftertreatment. This study aims at understanding the impact of catalyst composition on the behaviour on Pt and Pd active species during selective catalytic reduction of NOx by H2. For this purpose, a series of noble metal (NM)\/CeO2 catalysts containing WO3 or BaO as dopants, will be investigated by spatially resolved operando XAS measurements along the catalyst bed at Pt L3 and Pd K edges. ","588":"Hydroxyapatites (HA) are versatile materials that can substitute any of their basic units by ionic species possessing similar characteristics while maintaining their structural entity. Commonly, a cationic exchange at a superficial level is performed by substituting the Ca2+ by a similar metal cation (M2+). The substitution of the Ca2+ by Cu2+ ions is particularly interesting, due to the versatility of Cu in many different applicative fields, including heterogeneous catalysis. Yet, the knowledge of the nature of the Cu substituents at a molecular level is still scarce. Driven by encouraging findings about the red-ox activity of Cu-HA, we propose to study by in situ XAS a batch of Cu-HA with a Cu loading of 2-7 wt. % and high surface area. The proposed study will provide a full characterization of Cu-HA in terms of Cu oxidation state and coordination environment, under model conditions designed to explore the potential of these materials towards selective oxidation catalysis.","589":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate to which extent different synthetic routes, i.e. inverse miniemulsion (wet-chemistry) and ball milling (solid state-chemistry) affect the local structure of photoluminescent materials, e.g. calcium molybdate (CaMoO4) doped with Eu3+ ions, and correlate these findings with the observed optical and chemico-physical properties. We aim to evaluate the dopant-induced variations on the structure (electronic, short- and long-range) through a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements (at Eu L3-edge and Mo K-edge) and X-ray diffraction. In particular. experiments will be performed in situ while annealing at 900 \u00b0C, both in vacuum and in air. With these, we further focus on understanding the details of the annealing process, in either vacuum or air, since the atmosphere of the process was found to affect the final photoluminescent and conductivity properties of calcium molybdate to a different extent depending on the synthetic route.","591":"TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with supported metal co-catalysts are widely employed for hydrogen photocatalytic production. The optimization of these systems entails insight on the phenomena and reaction mechanisms involved at the molecular level, which is far from being complete. This proposal aims to reveal the evolution of metal species during the deposition of Pt\/Cu NPs on TiO2 and the subsequent H2 photoproduction by combining Cu K-edge, Pt L3-edge XAS, UV-Vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Systematic variation of the synthetic procedure will help to clarify the role of each component on the final structure and reveal structure-activity relationships in the resulting catalysts.

Combined XRD and Ce-K-edge XAS studies will allow to follow in situ the direct incorporation of the {CexZr6-xO4(OH)4} precursors into the 3D metal-organic frameworks through ligand exchange reactions. The overall goal is to demonstrate that Ce\/Zr-MOFs with well-defined stoichiometries can be synthesized with pre-made hexanuclear clusters, which would allow us to tune the electronic and catalytic properties for possible applications in (photo-) catalysis. ","593":"New generations of nuclear reactors require the development of innovative methods to elaborate nuclear fuels. Within this framework, studies have been devoted to the hydrothermal conversion of An(IV) oxalates (An = Th, U, Np, Pu) which allows the direct and quantitative precipitation of hydrated oxides from solution. In this frame, our group is currently studying the hydrothermal conversion of uranium(IV)-cerium(III) mixed oxalates into oxides, cerium being used as a surrogate for plutonium. These two elements can exist in several oxidation state in solution, thereby inducing a complex redox behaviour during hydrothermal treatment. In situ HERFD-XANES experiments will be used to directly monitor the redox state and the speciation of both elements during hydrothermal conversion of oxalates under various conditions of temperature and pH. Understanding of these conversion mechanisms will then allow to deduce optimum experimental conditions for the synthesis of uranium-cerium oxides.","594":"Noble metal-free molecular electrocatalysis for CO2 activation is a fast growing field. Thanks to their structural modularity, these molecular structures can lead to the fine understanding of the mechanisms involved in the catalytic process through the definition of structure-activity relationships. This understanding is the key toward the development of the earth-abundant based catalyst to be integrated to fuel cell and electrolysers for H2 production or CO2 valorisation. This proposal aims at studying, operando, a surface confined cobalt-based molecular catalyst for aqueous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. We will disclose the evolution of the molecular structure of the catalyst (geometry, nature of the ligands) as a function of the applied potential, in the presence or absence of the substrate. This will allow to precisely access to the real structure of the electroactive species and to apprehend potential degradation pathways.","595":"PdAu alloys are promising catalysts for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). This project aims to understand the formation of surface alloys from Au-Pd\/C nanocomposite catalysts.

Based on varying metal mass ratios (Pd:Au), different composites were prepared as formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) catalysts. Comparing different Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles prepared by a laser ablation method with the in situ formed alloy nanoparticles from nanocomposites, we will investigate if the latter approach is suitable for preparing stable surface alloys, limiting the use of the critical raw materials (CRM). The catalysts will be exposed to different FAOR protocols, during which operando XRD \/ XAS measurements are performed. ","596":"Pd\/In2O3 has been shown to be a promising catalyst used for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Characterisation of the\r\nPd\/In2O3 pre- and post-reaction combined with theoretical modelling, pointed to the proper anchoring of palladium clusters to In2O3,\r\npermitting particularly improved H2 dissociation. In contrast, in situ XAFS data has shown that In and Pd go onto form a bimetallic nanoparticulate species during reaction. Some of our recent work, has shown that it is possible to create supported Pd\/In (on Al2O3) with a similar level of CO2 hydrogenation performance to Pd\/In2O3. This work provides us with an opportunity to examine the nature of Pd\/In species for optimal methanol yields since the In data in particular will be less dominated by In2O3. We propose to perform XAFS measurements during activation (in H2) and under operando conditions (during CO2 hydrogenation) to follow the structure of Pd and In speciation and to correlate this with performance (activation vs. deactivation).","597":"Nickel-based spinel are stable, active and selective catalysts for the methanation of CO2, but their stability makes them difficult to activate. By adjusting the composition of such spinels, the reducibility at low temperatures is significantly increased. The methanation of CO2 using nickel spinels has not yet been studied under operando conditions to correlate the structural changes to the catalytic properties. Here, the influence of manganese on the reduction process and its role in the reaction will be investigated. First, investigate in EXAFS\/XANES information on the evolution of the oxidation states and the local coordination environment of the metals (Ni and Mn) during reduction and catalysis. We couple it with XRD, to correlate these changes with accompanying changes in the long-range order of the material. These information will increase the understanding of properties required for highly active spinel catalysts in CO2 methanation and thus contributes to better catalysts.","599":"The aim of this proposal is to synthesize, study the structures and high-pressure behavior of iron halides in diamond anvil cells at conditions close to the Earth's lower mantle and outer core by means of single crystal XRD and SMS.

We want to track structural changes\r\nleading to phase transition occurring around 0.6GPa in its highly luminescent triclinic beta polymorph, describe its mechanism and investigate structures of high-\r\npressure modulated phases coexisting as domains of an initially single crystal at pressures reaching up to 6 GPa. In the long term we aim to correlate distinct\r\nphotoluminescent properties of the compound in its various forms and at various pressures with the crystal structure and its evolution under mechanical stress.\r\nWe are particularly interested in the evolution of the Au...Au short contacts and the relative orientation of the pyrene moieties, which are the underlying cause of\r\nthe modulations in the structure.","602":"Despite the paramount importance of carbon dioxide as a simple system and also as a geophysical relevant material, the experimental investigations are limited so far only up to 120 GPa. Our research proposal is to study the phase diagram of carbon dioxide at extreme pressures. We would like to perform a detailed and extensive study of carbon dioxide between 100 and 300 GPa at room and at high temperatures by laser heating in order to investigate the stability field of carbon dioxide under geothermal conditions. In addition we propose to discover the transition from the 3D extended phase V (beta-cristobalite I-42d)  to a new layered 2D phase with carbon still in 4 fold coordination (layer-AB P42\/nmc or layer-AA P-4m2) which is expected to become stable above 200 GPa as obtained by several simulations studies.","604":"Nitrogen is the element can that store and release the largest quantity of chemical energy through the transformation from its single- to triple-bonded states. A single-bonded, nitrogen-only, solid would be the ideal high-energy density material because of its performance but also due to its eco-friendly nature. One pathway to achieving this is to produce a polynitrogen salt in which a polynitrogen anion is stabilized by a polynitrogen cation. While many energetic anionic nitrogen species have thus far been discovered, options are severely lacking for polynitrogen cations. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the fluorine-nitrogen system up to 130 GPa in laser-heated diamond anvil cells and observe the formation of the first pressure-formed polynitrogen cation. Based on successful preliminary experiments, CoF3 will be used as the fluorine reservoir. All samples will be characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD).","606":"We have developed a series of 7-9 nm Carbon nanodots (CNDs) doped with Gd (III) (Gd-CND). They present good stability, biocompatibility and r1 relaxivity values comparable with those of clinical contrast agents, making them interesting as multimodal nanomaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) and theragnostic applications. ICP-MS show high Gd accumulation in cells treated with Gd CNDs, suggesting that they might penetrate inside cells (desired for new contrast agents). Unfortunately, this could not be confirmed using confocal microscopy or TEM, as those techniques cannot detect intracellular Gd-CNDs. As such, we intend to acquire correlative organelle fluorescence probe Cryo-CLEM and XRF tomograms from cells treated with our Gd-CND at ID16A. This will allow us to obtain 3D information on the localisation of the material within cells with sub-cellular resolution, helping to assess their potential as viable MRI and theragnostic agents for bioimaging and biomedical applications.","607":"High energy density and improved safety combined with long cycle life are crucial goals for the development of the more environmentally being next generation lithium batteries (LIBs).  Layered lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides  (NMC811) are one of the most promising positive electrode materials due to their high capacity and low cost. However, the structural instability of NMC811 seriously restricts the battery performance and decreases lifetime.  To improve NMC811 performance, a thin protective coating can be used on the electrode for stabilizing NMC811 at high voltages. We have synthesized a novel coating on the surface of a NMC811 electrode  which enhances the structural and chemical stability even at high working potentials, and consequently protect the cathode capacity. Synchrotron X-ray tomography will be in a key role to investigate the role of the coating against the parasitic reactions,  and crack formation, for developing NMC811 enhancement.","608":"Understanding chemical trends down a full column of the periodic table is limited due to the paucity of complexes that can equivalently host both d-block and f-block metal sites. We have synthesised a series of phosphanide [M(Tren)(PH2)] (1) and phosphinidene [M(Tren)(PH)]-1 (2) organometallic compounds (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, U). The two variants of compound differ in the nature of metal-phosphorous bonding \u2013 (1) containing a single M-P bond, while (2) exhibits an M=P double-bond. We propose to quantify metal-phosphorous bond covalency using phosphorous K pre-edge XANES analysis at ID21.This is a unique opportunity to study a full triad of the d-block and link it to the actinides, probing the 3d\/4d\/5d\/6d\/5f contributions to bonding.  The results of this experiment will unlock differences in d-block versus f-block chemical properties, furthering the field of actinide covalency studies and providing a basis for improved nuclear waste management protocols.","610":"The molecular properties of water serves an important role in both chemistry and biology, as individual water molecules can take the role of active participants in solution-phase reactions. Though water solvation has been studied extensively, a good description of the micro-structure of the solvation shells surrounding water solvated complexes remains elusive. In this experiment, we aim to study water solvation by determining the structure of the photoaquated species which forms following light-induced ligand-dissociation of [Fe(CN)6]4- in aqueous solution. Further, we will further investigate the structural changes of the solvation cage following photo-abstraction of an electron by photo-exciting at a slightly shorter wavelength. We propose to study these phenomena with time resolved wide angle X-ray scattering. Leveraging the structural and temporal sensitivity of sub-nanosecond X-ray pulses to gain new insights into the dynamics of aqueous solvation.","611":"Metal\u2013ligand interaction is one of the major factors determining the chemical properties of inorganic and organometallic complexes. It is natural to expect that a series of metal complexes having the same metal center but different ligands would show different reactivities and reaction pathways. Such a dependency of the reactivities on the identity of the ligand allows room for the design and control of the reaction. For this purpose, it is necessary to understand the detailed molecular mechanism of how the M\u2013L interaction affects the reactivities and reaction pathways. In this proposal, we propose to visualize the structural change of [AuX2\u2212]n (X = Br or I) in acetonitrile during the photoreaction pathways.  We will investigate the photoreaction pathways of analogous systems having heavier ligands of which the position can be sensitively traced via TRXL. By doing so, we seek to obtain direct clues for understanding how the M\u2013L interaction affects the photoreaction pathways.","612":"This proposal aims to study the activation of bimetallic cobalt-based nanoparticles using in situ wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) to monitor the evolution of bimetallic cobalt-base NPs during the reduction in the H2\/water vapor atmosphere and investigate the impact of Re and Pt content on the process dynamics and crystallographic structure of the formed phases. Furthermore, the evolution of the FT catalysts during such a crucial process as activation will be monitored.","613":"The aim of this proposal is to study the electronic state of the three redox centres (Mn, Ni, and O) involved in the electrochemical mechanism of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 (LLMNO), a Li-rich layered oxide high-capacity positive electrode material for Li-ion batteries. Mn and O will be probed by ex situ X-ray Raman Scattering (XRS) at the O K-edge and the Mn L2,3-edges, whereas the state of Ni will be studied by Kbeta X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES). By combining all the results, we aim to directly follow the charge contribution of the different cationic and anionic redox centres (Mn, Ni, and O) at different stages of the electrochemical cycling. By coupling these results to ab initio calculations, we will be able to monitor the reorganization of TMs unoccupied electronic states close to the Fermi level, providing a clear description of the electronic structure of the TM-O bonding during battery cycling. ","614":"Layered Ni-rich lithiated metal oxides such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) are attractive candidates as next-generation Li-ion battery (LiB) positive electrode materials due to their high capacities, high working potential and reasonable price. Unfortunately, the cycle life of these materials is relatively short due to the structural instability at high delithiated states. However, the loss in performance over time can be retarded by either bulk or surface Zr-doping. The goal of this experiment is to perform operando XAS on different Zr-doped and undoped electrodes in fresh and aged assembled coin cells to understand the exact role and behaviour of the dopant in the host NMC structure during cycling.","616":"Vanadia-based catalysts are the system of choice for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 (NH3-SCR) in stationary plant applications.. Despite being largely studied, a comprehensive picture of the structure-activity relation at atomistic level for these catalysts is still under way. Furthermore, the NH3-SCR catalytic activity enhancement, due to the presence of HCl in the stationary plant exhaust feed, so far has been largely neglected. To rationalize the active sites oxidation state and redox dynamics, the local structure, and the reaction pathway, with this proposal we aim at systematically investigating a model V\/TiO2 catalyst by operando XAS during NH3-SCR. We will focus on high-quality XANES and EXAFS data collection in reaction conditions, to determine the V5+\/V4+ redox dynamics, the role of HCl and the coordination of the adsorbed reaction intermediates.","617":"In the panorama of H2 production strategies we are currently exploring the water gas shift (WGS) reaction over metal single sites supported on cerium-based UiO-66(Ce). We have recently prepared a Ce3+ rich UiO-66(Ce) catalyst with anchored Pt single sites. The catalyst presented similar catalytic activity than the conventional Pt\/CeO2 catalyst at lower temperature (150 vs 50\u00b0C). Operando FT-IR and ex-situ Ce L3-edge XAS spectra unveiled a relation between the higher activity and hydrides\/formate formation parallel to a higher Ce3+ content. We here propose to measure coupled DRIFT\/XAFS spectra under operando conditions to obtain a solid comprehension of the electronic\/structural\/chemical interaction leading to higher catalytic properties of Pt\/UiO-66(Ce) and disclosing the different reaction mechanisms over the two catalysts.","619":"Iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters are ubiquitous metallocofactors, which drive the crucial biological processes to enable life on earth, ranging from iron homeostasis and gene regulation to multielectron transfer and enzymatic catalysis. Among them, cuboidal Fe4S4 clusters bearing cysteine ligands are the most represented structures and are found in a large number of biological systems as mediators of long-range electron transfers or directly as catalytic active sites of enzymes. It has been reported that the redox processes in mono- and multinuclear iron thiolate and sulfide complexes involve extensive electronic relaxations that are greatly affected by the ligand, which can contribute significantly to the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electron transfer. Therefore, in the current study we aim to investigate the sulfur ligand spectra of our Fe4S4 complexes, which can be used to gauge the contributions of super- and double-exchange to the valence delocalization in these systems.","620":"Perovskite transition metal oxides (ABO3) are cost-efficient catalysts for CO oxidation reactions. Yet, the effect of thin films and nanoparticles variation on the catalytic mechanism is not understood well. We will investigate the differences between nanoparticles and thin films. In addition, we will study the B-site doping effect in LaMnxNi1-xO3. Using high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD), we will study HERFD-XAS of La(Mn,Ni)O3 thin films (thickness: 0.4-10 nm) and nanoparticles (size: 30-50 nm) under operando conditions. The HERFD-XAS pre-edges contain 1s3d quadrupole local and 1s4p pre-edge nonlocal transitions, in which the extracted information of spin state and covalency plays a vital role in describing the activity. Moreover, we will measure the 1s2p RIXS that probes the \u201cL2,3 XAS-like\u201d information. We will use DFT and charge transfer multiplet calculations[3-5] in order to simulate the HERFD-XAS and the 1s2p RIXS, respectively.","622":"Previously, we performed XAS studies to try to confirm the oxidation of Co centers and Co-O\/-N\/-C coordination. Due to the low resolution of those XAS experiments to distinguish O\/N\/C species with similar Z-number, we were not able to resolve the real active local-structure driving OER in CoNCN\/CNTs. In this proposal, we aim to perform operando Vtc-XES and HERFD-XANES experiments to monitor the local-structure reconstruction processes in metal carbodiimides on carbon nanotubes (MNCN\/CNT, M=Co\/Fe\/Ni) and unravel the effective coordination of metal centers for improved electrocatalysis. The Vtc-XES sensitivity to identify light C\/N\/O atoms in complex metallic matrixes, will allow us to determine the energy shifts in the ligand 2s ionization energies of bound C\/N\/O species upon catalytic activation. This will offer in-depth understandings on the structure-function relationships between coordinating O\/N\/C atoms and metal centers for designing high-performance MNCN-based electrocatalysts.","623":"With this experiment, we propose to employ operando HERFD XANES and XES measurements to track the chemical\/structural response of size-selected metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) exposed to oxidizing electrochemical conditions and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte. In particular, we plan to compare the structure, the composition and their evolution, under OER conditions for a series of CoFeOx and NiFeOx catalysts with well-defined particle sizes. The time-dependent evolution of the oxidation state and the local structure of the transition metal species under working conditions will be followed aiming to observe and rationalize the effect of the particle size and NP composition. In addition to the measurements performed under static conditions, we will explore the response of the catalyst to pulsed reaction conditions, which can provide more details about the charge accumulation in the catalyst and shed new light on the atomistic details of the OER mechanism.","624":"The primary efficiency-limiting factor in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is the inefficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. Advanced octahedra oh-PtNiIr nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit a 10-fold increase in activity compared to commercial Pt catalysts. However, when coated on the membrane, they suffer from Pt and Ni dissolution during PEMFC operation. Dissolved Ni might redeposit on NP's surface or migrate into the membrane, affecting protons' transport and reducing the fuel cell's performance. Knowing Ni migration dynamics is highly important, as it will help to understand why the 10-fold activity enhancement of advanced bimetallic catalysts measured in a laboratory does not translate to real PEMFC devices. For this reason, we designed a PEMFC capable of both high current densities and operando XAS depth profiling of Ni in the membrane, which allows following nickel in the membrane electrode assembly and correlating its movement with the operation parameters.","625":"While methane to methanol conversion in industry is a multistep, energy intensive reaction, soluble methane monooxygenases (sMMO) are capable of converting methane to methanol in a single step under ambient conditions. Understanding the catalytic cycle of sMMO would open doors towards biocatalytic liquid fuel production. The structure of MMO-Q, the key intermediate to which activates methane, has been the subject of debate for decades. VtC XES is a particularly effective method for ligand identification between similar scatterers, and can even be used in combination with density functional theory calculations to determine protonation states of ligands. Additionally, the use of model complexes with related di-iron structures will aid in creating a framework for comparison with QM\/MM DFT models. As such, we propose to apply VtC XES for the study of sMMO-Q and relevant model complexes.","626":"Ru(II) compounds are widely used in catalysis. Here we have designed an air-stable surface -[bipy-Ru(II)(CO)2Cl2] site that is obtained by reduction of -[bipy-Ru(III)Cl4]- with simultaneous ligand exchange from Cl- to CO. The -[bipy-Ru(II)(CO)2Cl2] site enables oxidation of CO while the Ru(III) site is completely inert. This raises interesting questions on 1) why Ru(III) is not active; 2) the role of Cl and CO ligand in catalysis; 3) how O-O bond is split. Luckily, Ru L3 edge and Cl K edge are only 15 eV away from each other, motivating us for an in situ Resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy (RIXS) study of the molecular orbital configuration that allows characterization of the bonding of the ligands to Ru(II)\/(III). This work contributes to the study of electronic structures of single-site catalysts at molecular level. With one excitation, both Ru and Cl emission can be observed. This principle can be utilized to study metals at interface for catalysis and energy systems.","627":"In this proposal we aim to understand the mechanisms by which toxic \u201cheavy metal\u201d ions (e.g., Pb2+, Zn2+) that are dissolved in aqueous solutions influence the dissolution at mineral surfaces. We will focus specifically on calcium carbonate (calcite, CaCO3) surfaces as they are pervasive in the natural environment and can act as sinks of heavy metals (e.g., by adsorption and incorporation). To achieve this goal, we plan to observe these processes by analyzing the changes in external morphology and internal strain distribution of small (~1 mm) calcite crystals in acidic solutions. This includes: 1. dissolution of pure calcite crystals in Pb-containing solutions; and 2. Dissolution of calcite with previously incorporation of Zn. These observations will be achieved using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI). ","628":"Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide are harmful pollutants commonly emitted by various industrial processes. Their efficient removal from air and exhaust gases is therefore crucial to meet environmental regulations and prevent environmental and health hazards. However, until now, experimental studies aiming at understanding the underlying adsorption mechanisms by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) are lacking, and current knowledge mostly relies on simulations and spectroscopic data. In this proposal, we aim at investigating the sorption mechanisms of H2S and SO2 in several MOF systems, inside the safe and confined environment of a sealed capillary, avoiding the use of potential hazardous setups containing large amount of those gases. These experiments should enable to localize the gas molecules inside the MOF frameworks, to determine the occurrence of potential framework degradation and to measure adsorption isobars by varying the temperature of the sample contained in the capillary.","629":"In this proposal we present new hybrid crystalline materials based on a nitrogen-donor organic molecules and a biological active molecule, namely quercetin and morin. Materials were assembled with different transition metal cations depending on the final application, obtained by either microwave-assisted synthesis or under solvothermal conditions. Materials are obtained as microcrystalline powders or small-sized single crystals. For this reason, our in-house diffractometers have not been effective in the elucidation of the new crystal architectures. We believe that the high-resolution data collected at the BM01 and ID22 beamlines will allow us to unveil the crystalline structures of these materials. Because of their interesting application, the crystallographic data would help us to understand the biological activity of these bio-materials as well as the possible interactions that they create with different biological species (namely DNA and RNA). ","630":"We propose to perform an in situ PXRD experiment during thermal cycling and gas adsorption on a perfluorinated AlIII-based metal-organic framework (MOF) with MIL-53 topology, dubbed F4_MIL-53(Al), at beamline BM01. The aim of the experiment is to gain detailed insight into the phase transitions occurring when the MOF is either thermally cycled or exposed to adsorptives such as N2, Ar and CO2. This is motivated by the interest in further understanding the flexible behaviour of this MOF, which features a temperature-induced phase transition and whose adsorption isotherms display several steps, suggestive of adsorption-induced phase changes. Of special interest is the fact that both the calorimetric profile and the adsorption isotherms display much smaller hysteresis than the fully hydrogenated version of the same MOF, which is the prototypical \u201cbreathing\u201d material.","631":"The scope of this proposal is to investigate a class of 2D materials based on Fe and Ni that neither exist in nature as free-standing atomically layers, nor as a thicker\r\nmineral compound. These transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) that cannot be obtained by equilibrium growth methods or be exfoliated from the bulk, but may\r\nonly be synthesized directly in their 2D form by combined PVD\/CBE growth on a suitable substrate like Au(111). The proposal will explore the synthesis strategies\r\nfor these new 2D materials and characterize their structure in situ using Grazing Incidence Surface X-ray Diffraction (GI-SXRD), scanning tunneling microscopy\r\n(STM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and electron diffraction techniques. We expect these newly synthesized 2D TMDCs to exhibit new physico-chemical\r\nproperties such as catalytic, magnetic, piezoelectric, optical and electronic conduction properties.\r\n","632":"Following the ambient conditions synthesis of the aromatic pentazolate [N5]-, its six-membered counterpart, the aromatic hexazine [N6]4- ring, is the next frontier in high-energy density nitrogen chemistry. Targeted for synthesis since 1980, [N6]4- has only recently been produced in the complex K9N56 compound at 46 GPa. However, being partly composed of weakly bonded neutral N2 dimers, K9N56 could not be recovered to ambient conditions. Through the investigation of the Rb-N and Cs-N systems up to 130 GPa, this proposal aims at forming compounds comprised of the same exotic [N6]4- anion\u2014also expected from theoretical calculations\u2014and at recovering them to ambient conditions. The solids\u2019 crystal structure will be determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, also employed to assess the novel materials\u2019 recoverability to ambient conditions. This study will complete the investigation of all binary alkali-nitrogen systems, enabling to evidence trends in their high-pressure behavior.","633":"We propose to study the H2- and CO-induced structural reconstruction of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) in Ru\/Al2O3 catalysts by time-resolved XRD\/PDF experiments under gas- and liquid-phase conditions. Preliminary gas-phase experiments (CH-6371) showed restructuring of Ru NPs during H2 activation, and literature reports ample evidence of CO-induced oxidative disruption of small Ru clusters, responsible for an increase in metal dispersion but potentially deactivating the catalyst. Yet, a comprehensive description of adsorbate-induced structural change within Ru catalysts is lacking. Although important for industrial applications, restructuring processes are much less explored in the liquid phase. These results will further inform on the comparison of gas-phase and liquid-phase conditions and cover the structural dynamics and kinetics of Ru NPs during the key stages of Ru-hydride formation and CO-induced oxidative disruption.","635":"Atomically dispersed Pd\/CeO2 and Pt\/CeO2 are promising three-way catalysts since they reach full conversion of harmful gases such as CO and NOx at much lower temperatures than the current generation of commercial catalysts. One of their main drawbacks is their low stability at the high temperatures that can be reached inside a catalytic converter. Our objective is the comprehensive investigation of structural changes occurring during treatment of such catalysts under realistic three-way catalysis conditions.This involves high temperatures (>900\u00b0C), an artificial exhaust gas mixture and switches between oxidizing and reducing gas atmospheres. Using operando XRD and PDF, we plan to investigate the formation of metal and metal oxide phases as a function of temperature and redox conditions, observe the sintering kinetics of ceria and track the formation of oxygen vacancies in ceria in different gas atmospheres.","636":"Hetero structured materials like Pb18AgSbTe20 exceeds a thermoelectric figure of merit of 2 due to scattering phonons at grain boundaries and associated effects. We decomposed homogeneous quenched PbAgSbTe3 to different amounts of PbTe and AgSbTe3 to understand the effects and influence of the nanoscaled spiondal decompositions on the thermoelectric material. In-situ 3D-XRDCT will show the various impacts on Seebeck coefficient, thermal and electrical conductivity of microstructures of different decomposed PbAgSbTe3. The scans will be done while the material is under working condition in a temperature gradient or under applied current to understand the effects of the segregation on properties. In addition, space resolved PXRD will give information about state of decomposition and the reflection shapes about the grain sizes.","637":"irconium vanadate is a well-known negative thermal expansion (NTE) material, which can be used for creating composites with controllable expansion coefficients.

Electrochemical oxidation of graphite during in certain concentrations of sulphuric acid is known method to produce graphite oxide (GO).However, the chemical mechanism and detailed understanding of structural changes which occur in process of  GO formation were examined by experimental studies. The main goal of the project is in-situ study of electrochemical GO formation in aqueous H2SO4 and HClO4 electrolytes. It is expected that the mechanism of graphite electrochemical overoxidation is more complex than one proposed in literature based on ex situ studies of reaction products. The new findings and conclusions will contribute to fundamental understanding of electrochemical oxidation of graphite and contribute to more wide use of electrochemical oxidation to produce high quality graphite\/graphene oxide.","640":"Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have drawn much attention over the last decade due to their high conversion efficiency. Their drawback is that they are not environmentally stable. We have shown that by a bio-inspired method of incorporating amino acids into the lattice of these semiconductors we not only tune the band gap but also increase their stability. As a next stage we want to study the effect the incorporated amino acids have on the known diffusion of Cl- and I- ions in the lattice of MAPbBr3 in which one obtains intermixing, i.e., MAPbBrnX3-n (X = Cl, I, n = 0-3). The diffusion is strongly affected by illumination: intermixed crystals tend to segregate under illumination to Br-rich and X-rich perovskite domains and re-mix when the illumination is turned off. In this propsoal we will study time-resolved diffusion of Lys-incoporated MAPbBrnX3-n when illumination is turned on  and then off at various temperatures.

Understanding these processes is mandatory for increasing the lifetime. Our previous studies on Pt(111) and Pt(100) revealed the mechanism by which Pt atoms are extracted from the surface during the initial stages of oxidation. However, the relationship between the electrochemical charge transfer that is required for the formation of surface oxide species and restructuring of the Pt surface is still unknown. We here propose to disentangle these processes by systematic studies of the oxidation\/reduction kinetics on Pt(111) and Pt(100) on the millisecond time scale. In these studies, we will monitor the Pt extraction and charge transfer by operando high energy X-ray surface diffraction (HESXRD) and simultaneous electrochemical measurements.","644":"We will use HWXRD to study further the structure of Pt\/Al2O3 catalysts during the dehydrogenation reaction of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) benzyltoluene.

High-pressure X-ray reflectivity studies of interfacial phases formed by solutions of chosen OFMs in dodecane (a model for the lubricant base oil) in the absence and presence of water on silica surfaces will be performed to evaluate the influence of pressure (1-30 bar) and temperature (20-180\u00b0C) on the adsorption of these friction modifiers and compared with benchtop tribological tests.","646":"We propose to investigate Compton scattering in the molecule CO.

Such molecular-frame electron angular distributions mirror the intricate process of multiple scattering of electrons in a molecular potential. They are thoroughly investigated for ionization by photoabsorption (MFPADs), which is restricted by dipole selection rules, but have never been measured for ionization by Compton scattering, where they are expected to be much richer, as no selection rules are present.","647":"Via operando SAXS\/WAXS\/total scattering, we plan to gain valuable insights into the degradation of High Entropy Alloys which offer promising properties for fuel cell applications.

The proposed systems consist of single crystals containing 3d metals, and will be measured at the metal K-edge. The molecules have been chosen to represent cases where 1) the position of the metal in the crystal is representative of the full point symmetry of the crystal, and 2) where the position is of lower symmetry than the point symmetry of the crystal. We hypothesize that the position of the metal atom representative of the full crystal symmetry should enhance the XNCD response.","650":"The aim is to use X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES), X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) to gain structural information on MOFs modified post-synthetically for catalytic purposes. The targeted compounds have been prepared by exposing MOF-808 to amino acid and carboxyl acid functions, to later on immobilize FeII or FeIII ions similarly than metalloenzyme and methane monooxygenase does. This synthetic strategy does not allow us to predict neither the oxidation state nor coordination environment of the metallic ions, which is essential to understand the catalytical activity of the final compounds in the oxidation of methane to methanol, specially after their activation with oxidant species as O2, H2O2 or NO2. In a long-term perspective, the knowledge gained from the proposed experiments will be used to establish a methodology to deliberately tune the catalytic sites installed into the pore space of MOFs, and hence, their functionality.","651":"We have developed a novel gas-phase approach to unique, low-valent metal-organic frameworks, exemplified by [Mo(CO)3(bipy)3\/2]n (bipy = 4,4\u2032-bipyridine) and [W(CO)3(bipy)3\/2]n. The metal nodes are stabilised by carbonyl ligands (CO), which can be liberated upon visible light irradiation. CO ligands can be replaced with paramagnetic NO, and the magnetic moment distribution of these M\u2013NO complexes will provide key insights into the electronic structures of the materials. We aim to use ID12 to directly probe the electronic structure of the  metal atoms in the bulk product and as nanocrystalline coatings, using XANES at the Mo and W L2,3 edges, w\/o in situ laser photolysis. Furthermore, analysis of the magnetic moment transfer from coordinated NO to the metal sites will be unravelled using XMCD will yield insights into the nature of the bonding that we expect to be fundamentally different to what is currently known for conventional, higher-valent MOFs.\r\n","652":"Coordination polymers based on octacyanotungstate(IV) and magnetically non-innocent manganese(II) complex cations establish a new class of high-temperature photomagnets with photo-induced magnetic ordering temperatures exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. In this proposal we aim to fully determine the mechanism of the reversible photomagnetic switching in these unique compounds, which seem to be associated with the reversible ligand dissociation at the tungsten center. The XAS\/XMCD measurements seem to be the only technique that enables direct insight into the electronic\/magnetic structure of W, where the photo-induced changes take place. The unequivocal determination of the photoswitching mechanism was not possible using other general techniques such as single-crystal and powder XRD or IR spectroscopy. The new knowledge gained through the implementation of the proposal will enable a rational approach to the design of the 2nd generation of photomagnets working at RT.","653":"A series of isostructural magnetic coordination polymers {[MII(pyrazole)4]2[NbIV(CN)8].4H2O}n (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively) show long-range magnetic ordering below 24, 8, 6 and 13 K due to the strong magnetic coupling between M and Nb. The exchange coupling changes from -6.8 for 1, through -3.1 for 2, +3.5 for 3 to +8.1 cm-1 for 4. This affects the nature of the long-range magnetic ordering in the 1-4 series: ferrimagnetic in 1 and 2 with antiparallael alignment of the Mn-Nb and Fe-Nb magnetic moments to ferromagnetic in 3 and 4 with parallel alignment. The proposed XAS\/XMCD experiments performed at the Nb L2,3 edges with the application of sum rules are the only reliable way to unequivocally determine the magnetic structure of the four compounds. Moreover, compound 3 demonstrates switching of the type of long-range magnetic ordering under pressure. This will also be investigated by collecting XAS\/XMCD spectra at the Nb L2,3 edge under high pressure.","654":"Expanding on our previous efforts and interest towards developing multidimensional magnetic systems, our current project aims to construct 3D magnetic networks through reactions between 2D magnetic networks and the pre-synthesized radical-based precursor: Na+(tpn)\u25cf-(THF) (tpn = terephthalonitrile). This radical ligand is expected to intercalate between these layered structures and bridge metal nodes of these 2D metal-organic frameworks in three dimensions with porosity, and to introduce additional magnetic coupling between layers and paramagnetic tpn\u25cf- linkers.In this project, it is expected that the beamline experiments at ID12, including XANES and XMCD for a series of compounds, will be used to assign the oxidation states and local magnetic moment of the Cr site and determine its chemical environment. At BM01, the HR-PXRD is critical to study the temperature dependence of the structure of these unprecedented materials.","655":"High entropy oxides with rock salt structure have been recently discovered and hold significant potential for applications in energy storage and catalysis. The high configurational entropy arising from the mixed occupation of the cation site is thought to compensate the unfavourable enthalpy of solution of CuO, due to the suppression, in the cubic structure, of the intrinsic Jahn-Teller effect of d9 Cu(II) ions. XRD and EXAFS measurements of Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O seem to evidence a departure from the cubic structure at 300 \u00b0C, and possibly already at room temperature, but are not conclusive. We, therefore, propose to determine the local symmetry at the Co, Ni and Cu sites by means of RIXS in order to better clarify the role of configurational entropy in Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O and possibly other high entropy oxides.","656":"The design of highly performing anodes for Na-Ion Batteries is a mandatory step for their commercialization. Here the study of new\r\ncompositions of High Entropy Nasicon (NA Super Ionic CONductors) with formula NaM2(PO4)3 with M = Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Nb, Cr, V, Ti is proposed by means\r\nof XAS techniques to identify the electrochemical role of each metal centre.  The materials will be investigated under working conditions of the cell vs Na. This will allow for the i) determination of the correlation between each potential step to the relative M(n+1)\/Mn+ couple, ii) follow the changes in the local structure during sodium insertion\/extraction iii) establishment of the electrode working mechanism.","657":"Metal oxides photoanodes, such as WO3\/BiVO4 heterostructures, represent the state of the art towards photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but their\r\nefficiency is still hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and limited charge separation efficiency. Mixed Cobalt-Iron co-catalysts proved to be effective to temper such issues, however, a full comprehension of the catalytic cycle underlying such enhancement is yet to be achieved. To address this issue, we request beamtime to perform operando PEC-XAFS measurements, as a follow-up study to a previous beamtime at ESRF beamtime LISA BM-08. This experiments highlighted a structure-dependent response of the Co \u2013 Kedge upon bias and light stimuli, requiring further investigation. The present proposal aims to strenghten the understanding of the physical properties of this photocatalyst in real operating conditions, focusing on the Fe \u2013 Kedge behaviour and the dependence on the illumination source power.","658":"Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising devices for green energy generation. AEMFCs can use catalysts with ultralow loadings of critical raw materials. PdCu is a promising anodic Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction (HOR) electrocatalyst. It has been found that HOR electrochemical activity of PdCu is strongly related to the ratio between two phases present in the material, the Body Centered Cubic (BCC) and Face Centered Cubic (FCC). These two phases can be tailored by controlling the temperature during post production annealing. Still, despite the potential importance of this class of catalysts, little has been done to directly correlate PdCu alloy compositional and structural var iations with its electrochemical activity and durability. The experiment we propose aim to uncover this correlation, by proposing an in situ electrochemical XAS study of three different Pd:Cu electrocatalytical alloys prior and after the annealing.","659":"Noble metal-based catalysts are widely applied throughout the chemical industry or for clean air purposes in emission control. Identifying the active species and understanding its formation and deactivation is key for designing active and long-term stable catalysts. In recent studies by our group transient Pt states of Pt\/CeO2 catalysts were identified during CO oxidation by operando HERFD-XANES measurements combined with MCR-ALS and DFT calculations. As a next step, we would like to apply this powerful approach to study a Pt\/Al2O3 catalyst. The reaction mechanism is not completely understood and even though Pt is very active, it also suffers from fast deactivation, especially at lower temperatures.  Based on well-defined catalysts containing Pt17 cluster, we aim for fundamental mechanistic details in the reaction and the deactivation behaviour. By a systematic variation of the gas atmospheres and temperatures we want to track the Pt species and understand the cause of deactivation.","660":"Non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is a promising candidate to probe efficiently the speciation of actinide elements because XES can overcome the limitation usually encountered in standard techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and High-energy Resolution Fluorescence detected X-ray Absorption spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS). However, XES sensitivity toward actinide\u2019s speciation or local order is still missing, essentially because of the lack of the corresponding data. Therefore, we are proposing to perform extensive and systematic experiments on uranium oxide samples, showing various uranium speciation and local order. The obtained spectra will be then compared to electronic structure calculations, and when available XPS data, to build a better understanding of the uranium electronic structure in general and of the XES capability in particular.","661":"Cobalt compounds offer many exciting possibilities in chemical synthesis and catalysis. In order to realize the potential of cobalt compounds, a profound understanding of their electronic structure is required. We use cobalt compunds to the development of new synthetic procedures for organophosphorus compounds. Complexes containing redox-active 1,2-diimine ligands give access to valuable synthetic building blocks for phosphorus chemistry. Unfortunately, the challenging structural characterisation and oxidation state assignment in these compounds hinders further development. This proposal therefore aims at the thorough and precise the structural elucidation of a series of cobalt complexes using XRD. Moreover, the spectroscopic oxidation states of the Co atoms will be determined using K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). These data will give valuable insight into the relationship between structure, reactivity and metal oxidation state in the investigated complexes.","662":"Defective sites in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have a great impact on the performance of CO2 capture, the mechanism of which changes depending on the type and nature of these defects found at the metal sites. However, a detailed mechanistic, structural, and electronic understanding of the adsorption-desorption process over defective sites in amine-functionalized MOFs, known in the literature as highly performing CO2 capture porous materials, is lacking. Here we propose a combined in situ hard-X-ray XAS and XRD study targeting metal sites and MOFs pores to gain a structural and electronic understanding of CO2 adsorption over defective sites on a series of amino-tagged Fe(III) pyrazolate-based MOFs. We expect our spectroscopic and structural results to unveil the stages of CO2 capture over defective sites and functionalized pores with unprecedented structural detail, thereby paving the way for the rational design of improved MOF materials for CO2 adsorption and separation.","663":"With a predicted world population of over 9 billion people in 2050 and rapid economic growth, the pressure on natural resources is exponentially increasing. It is the case for critical metals, including Rare Earth Elements (REEs), that are the heart of a number of strategic technologies for the environmental transition. In the context of a circular economy, this project aims at extracting REEs from a secondary source: bauxite residue produced from alumina extraction. In particular, this project proposes to develop environmentally sustainable extraction processes based on the use of alternative solvents: deep eutectic solvents (DES). We propose here to investigate leaching mechanisms of REE oxides, hydroxides and carbonates (phosphate REEs were not dissolved in DES), as a model system in deep eutectic solvents. Those mineral forms are suspected to be representative of the speciation of REEs in most primary and secondary sources including bauxite residue.","664":"Single-atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of isolated metal active site dispersed on suitable supports, hold great promise for maximized metal utilization, exceptional tunability of the catalytic site, and selectivity. One of their key issues is that, when the metal atom concentration exceeds a certain threshold or the catalyst is exposed to certain experimental conditions, the single atoms tend to aggregate in clusters and nanoparticles, compromising the system selectivity and activity. We propose to investigate by XAS a set of 4 Ni-SACs and 4 Cu-SACs samples, with increasing metal loadings from 0.3 to 3 wt%, supported on C3N4, in selected oxidizing\/reducing environments and during the hydrogenation reaction of C2H2 to C2H4. The proposed study will provide a molecular understanding of the mechanisms leading to the aggregation of the single atoms under reaction conditions, helping to design more stable and efficient SACs.","665":"One approach to circumvent unfavorable thermodynamics of CO2-methanol synthesis compared to syngas feed is the in-situ condensation of methanol (and water) which shifts the equilibrium to the product side. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of in-situ methanol and water condensation on the catalyst structure of a Cu\/ZnO\/ZrO2 catalyst during CO2-methanol synthesis by using a novel high-pressure operando XAS reactor. Structure changes due to variation of pressure and temperature in the condensation zone will be monitored in a spatially-resolved manner in order to investigate possible deactivation mechanism like ZnO agglomeration, restructuring or loss of oxygen vacancies. These results could give valuable insights in catalyst stability under realistic conditions and enable knowledge-based catalyst design.","666":"The proposed experiments will contribute to determine size, structure and oxidation-state information of Ni and Co catalysts in ammonia decomposition. It will allow an explanation of catalytic differences from the kinetic studies (i.e. activation energy and rate) and contribute to understanding the dynamic re-dispersion of Ni and Co particles at different conditions. The results will be complemented by a full characterization by complementary techniques (XRD, XPS, TEM, TPD) and finally give insights into future catalyst design for ammonia decomposition.","667":"The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted a lot of attention over the past 10 years. The coupling of Cu with metal oxides offers great opportunities for this goal. In our group, we established a synthetic methodology, called colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) which allows the tuning of the morphology and thickness of Cu|MOx nanoparticles with different shell thicknesses from monolayers to tens of nm. We have discovered that spherical Cu@AlOx are active for CO2RR but, more importantly, stable during the reaction, which is opposite to what is observed for spherical copper nanoparticles alone. \r\n","668":"Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising catalytic platforms to accomplish the efficient oxidation of methane to methanol (MTM). Current artificial catalysts such as MOFs and zeolites cannot however sustain multiple MTM reaction cycles because of active site (AS) deactivation, an issue recently suggested to be due to the escape of methyl radicals from the Fe ASs by diffusion through pore apertures larger than 4.2 \u00c5. Herein we propose a combined XAS\/XRD study to investigate the evolution of the structural\/electronic properties of Fe sites during the N2O-mediated MTM conversion in a series of triiron node-based MOFs exhibiting pore apertures in the 3.0\u20138.6 \u00c5 range. The in situ experiment targeting the Fe(II) MOF centers able to form Fe(IV)=O sites active for the MTM conversion will desirably allow us to quantify the amount of Fe(II) sites regenerated after each performed reaction cycle, rationalizing the effect played by the size of pore apertures in MOF deactivation.","669":"This study aims to understand the effect of the support composition (Mg: Al ratio) on the activity and stability of the next generation of bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts for steam reforming of methane. For this purpose, systematic operando XAS and XRD experiments under model reaction conditions will be conducted during temperature ramps and at steady-state conditions. The structural evolution of the active species will be monitored by XAS measurements at the Ni K and Pt L3 edges while the overall phase changes due to the interplay between active species and support will be identified by X-ray diffraction measurements at selected stages of the experiments. ","670":"Silicon has approximately 10 times the capacity of the state-of-the-art anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). To fully utilise the charge capacity of Si, it is crucial to understand why it loses capacity so quickly when the battery is put through cycles of charge and discharge, and why nanosizing of the Si is effective in extending its cycle life. The best way to gain information about the structural changes during cycling which cause deactivation is by an operando study in a working battery. We aim use total X-ray scattering to obtain the pair distribution functions (PDFs) of working nano-Si anodes. Previous studies of crystalline Si have given some insight in the structural mechanics of cycling, but do not give clean enough data. To mitigate this, we have developed a new operando battery cell. This will then give information about the structural changes of Si combined with electrochemical data.","671":"The methane-to-methanol conversion is seen as one of the \"holy grail\" reactions of catalysis. One extensively examined approach is the chemical looping approach using copper exchanged zeolites. In-house studies have determined that copper-exchanged zeolite offretite outperforms all other zeolites in multiple metrics, not least yield. \r\n\r\nUsing quick XAS scans, we will investigate the kinetics of the different copper-species, as well as using XRD to examine the location of the copper-sites during each stage of the chemical looping cycle. On-line mass spectrometry will be used to observe the kinetics of product desorption and to determine the yield. Using the timeframes and yield will allow us to dermine the productivity of the process, a metric paramount to any other for determining if a process merits industrial valorisation. \r\n\r\nAs quick XAS scans and XRD may both be performed at BM31, it is the most suited beamline for such an experiment. \r\n","672":"Cu nanocrystals (NCs) are promising catalysts for CO2 electroreduction, and there is currently a great interest to expand the library of Cu NCs to improve their catalytic performance. Unfortunately, clear guiding principles for their synthesis are lacking and this prevents the rational synthesis of Cu NCs. We aim to further advance the understanding of the formation mechanism of Cu NCs to include icosahedra, 2D plates, rhombic dodecahedra, octahedra, etc. all of which can be synthesized from the same synthetic methods through variation of the nature of one reactant along with the heating conditions. We hypothesize that reaction kinetics regulate the growth of the different shapes. Thus, we propose the systematic investigation of different additives and heating conditions on the reaction kinetics, and how these determine the size and morphology of the Cu NCs.","673":"The aim of this proposal is to (1) determine the high-pressure stabilities of the crystal structures of three polymorphic forms of thiophosphoranyl anthracenes (alpha-AnPS, beta-AnPS, gamma-AnPS), (2) evaluate the pressure-induced changes in the molecular packing and intermolecular interactions, (3) determine the pressure evolution of the pi-stacking distance and anthracene overlap area in the pi-stacked dimers of beta-AnPS and gamma-AnPS, and (4) correlate the structural changes with the solid-state emission properties at high pressure. The proposed study will enable to deduce the effect of structural changes on the emission properties and to fine-tune their photoluminescent properties. Moreover, the proposed project will provide an answer whether by varying the distances between the anthracene molecules as well as their overlap, it is possible to modify the optical effect in a controlled manner.","674":"Cs3Sb2X9 X=I, Br metal halide perovskites derivatives of general formula have been proposed as possible less toxic and more stable alternatives to lead-containing materials for a wide range of applications from photovoltaics to photocatalysis. High pressure studies on the iodide containing phases revealed huge improvement of emission as well as metallization at moderate pressures. On the other hand, bromide counterparts have not explored and, in addition, mixed Sb\/Bi phases have shown reduction of band gap which deserves further exploration by high pressure diffraction and optical spectroscopy (carried out in our labs). Such coupled exploration of HP behaviour can help in designing novel materials with optimized properties. ","675":"Pyrene (C16H10), a representative of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), provides an attractive molecular arrangement for examining high pressure structural and chemical stability in aromatic compounds. Previous studies were limited to a few GPa small pressure range. Here, we propose a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) study of pyrene up to 70 GPa at ID15b. Aims of proposed experiments are investigations of pressure induced phase transformations and possible polymerization of pyrene, accurate structures of polymorphs, and characterisation of their crystal chemistry and compressional behaviour.","676":"The aim of the project is to unravel a general approach to subvalent silver oxides.\r\nAs a result of this experiment, we will not only generate a variety of novel high-pressure ternary and binary oxides but also will be able to rationalize the general synthetic procedures of subvalent oxides. This discovery appears to be of far-reaching relevance, as it is indicating an option for a purposeful and generally applicable access to multinary subvalent silver oxides.","678":"This proposal is aimed at exploring the high pressure chemistry of As and Sb in the Mbar pressure range.","679":"Here we propose to study the synthesis of polynitrogens in Na and K bearing systems, by reacting the azides with molecular N2 at high pressures. We will use laser heated diamond anvil cells (DAC) with toroidal diamonds to explore the pressure range up to 400-500 GPa and temperatures of synthesis up to 3000 K. We will apply extremely brilliant and tightly focused X-ray synchrotron beam of ESR for the monochromatic single-crystal X-ray diffraction in DAC with a large angular opening to obtain the structure and composition (atomic positions and occupancies) of polynitrides as a function of pressure. We expect to synthesize a variety of polynitrogen species (e.g., pentazolate rings) and study their metastability on unloading to ambient pressure. This research will stimulate discoveries of novel polynitrogens recoverable to ambient pressure and refine the computer codes that predict the structure and stability of various polynitrogen species.","680":"While the compression of benzene, the archetypal aromatic, to about 20 GPa is assessed to lead to the synthesis of partially crystalline, hydrogenated sp3 carbon nano-threads, the fate of benzene at more extreme conditions was poorly experimentally known. Our beam-time CH-6478 was devoted to push this frontier further. We heated benzene in DACs at pressures of 40-75 GPa by direct CO2 laser heating, thus avoiding potentially reactive absorbers. We found the laser-sample coupling to be critically dependent on the type of the diamonds, i.e IIas vs. Ia and, for one sample, we obtained temperatures of almost 2000 K with 60% of the maximum laser power. In this case, the T quenched material exhibited a small (about 5 micron) single crystal (SC) product, which we investigated via SC XRD and identified as a hexagonal phase, likely graphane, the DFT predicted thermodynamic extended phase for 1:1 CH stoichiometry. We now need to reproduce this result under improved experimental conditions. ","681":"In the pursuit of novel nitrogen-based compounds with prospects as technological materials, whether as high energy density materials, superhard materials, or others, as well as for building empirical knowledge on chemical rules in simple binary systems, nitrogen\u2019s behaviour has been investigated at high pressures with most elements in the periodic table. There is a single exception to this: halides. In an effort to begin closing out the final chapter on high-pressure nitrogen-based binary compounds. This proposal will focus on investigating the I-N and Br-N systems in laser-heated diamond anvil cell up to pressures of 130 GPa. Novel compounds are expected to be found, potentially a high energy density IN6 compound with hypervalent iodine, and their structures solved and refined with single-crystal X-ray diffraction.","682":"Diamond is a remarkable material with many exceptional properties, but additional three-dimensional, extended sp3 carbon structures are surprisingly rare. Using high-pressure methods, we recently discovered a new 3D boron-stabilized carbon framework material with polyhedral cages that trap metal atoms. This new carbon-based framework, called Type-I clathrate, was previously predicted to exhibit exceptional strength\/hardness, as well unique properties such as high-temperature superconductivity. Based on this result, we propose extended studies on these materials to include new compositions and structure types. These results will reveal a new family of diamond-like supermaterials with tunable electronic structures, and will reveal the role of guest\u2013host interactions on stability and physical properties.","683":"The process of formation of hard materials by living organisms, termed biomineralization, is renowned\r\nfor its ability to form the most intricate complex structures at ambient conditions, unmatched by current\r\nsynthetic efforts. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), the most abundant biomineral, is produced by a variety of\r\norganisms for different functionalities, morphing the CaCO3 mineral for its specific application through\r\nthe use of an amorphous precursor (ACC).\r\nOur group, inspired by these processes, has studied the formation of ACC and its transformation to\r\ncalcite, with regard to the presence and incorporation of organic molecules, and impurity ions such as\r\nMg2+ and ACC particle size. We recently discovered that the addition of a defined amount of amino\r\nacids induces the formation of ACC nanoparticles with a very narrow size distribution. The influence of\r\nthese amino acids, however, is unknown. We will use in-situ SAXS to understand this mechanism.","684":"The bend contours of multiply twinned nanoparticles (MTPs) provide an example of how specific crystallographic features dictate the geometric shape of finite-sized crystals. The formation of MTPs during colloidal synthesis can occur through at least two different pathways: A) growth from multiply twinned seeds or B) the stepwise formation of new twin boundaries on single-crystalline seeds (either by particle overgrowth or multiparticle attachment). Despite the abundance of these MTPs in colloidal synthesis, little to none is known about the dynamic transformation from nucleation to crystal growth. This proposal aims to complete a systematic in situ X-ray Scattering of the formation mechanism of MTPs, to understand how the geometry of a crystal shape correlates with the local and global atomic arrangement in presence of twin structures. The influence of reaction temperature and annealing time, surface ligands t on the reaction kinetics will be studied on various nanocrystals.","685":"Arrested spinodal demixing (SD) provides nanoporous materials with high surface area, excellent pore accessibility, and structural isotropy. These traits are sought-after for  sensing, catalysis, or energy applications. However, SD is still deemed inapplicable for aqueous solutions of small inorganic solids. Tenets claim that the instability regime is inaccessible as burst nucleation intervenes. With our approach combining unprecedented fast-flow chemistry with spontaneous formation of pre-critical coordination entities (eg, prenucleation clusters), SD becomes accessible in a wide range of inorganic solutes, ranging from mineral-forming main group compounds to transition-metal MOF-type systems. In this experiment, in-situ small- to ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering will provide the missing piece of evidence for genuine spinodal demixing via the occurence and temporal evolution of a dominant spinodal length and its centrosymmetric scattering patterns.","686":"Biofilms are groups of microbial cells that aggregate on surfaces and Interfaces. The cells in a biofilm are encased in an Extracellular Matrix (ECM) that serves\r\nas a shield for the cells from antibiotic activity. The ECM is a network of biopolymers, mainly polysaccharides and proteins, which composes more than 90% of\r\nthe dry weight of biofilms. Our general aim is to study the structure of the biopolymers within the biofilm, their orientation and spatial distribution along the biofilm,\r\nand to correlate them with the structure of the purified biopolymers. In this proposal we extend our study from 2D biofilms into studying structural and metal ions gradients in biofilms cross sections","687":"Ternary and quaternary copper-based sulfides have attracted significant attention in the last few years as potential thermoelectric (TE) materials. Recent results showed the crucial role of order\/disorder phenomena and interfaces on the thermoelectric properties of copper-based sulfides. We propose to investigate the nano-microstructure of Cu26V2Sn6S32 and Cu2MnGeS4 series of compounds, aiming to correlate synthesis conditions (composition, sintering time and temperature), structure, nano-microstructure and TE properties. After synthesis and laboratory characterization, the samples showing the most interesting thermoelectric properties will be studied by scanning Wide Angle X-ray Scattering on ID13, taking advantage of the available nano-focused beam (70 nm). Combined to precession electron diffraction tomography performed in-lab, we aim to reveal the internal structure of these compounds and its impact on their properties, allowing for better material understanding and conception.","688":"Fireworms are a type of marine bristleworm that have long, slender bodies that can grow up to 35 centimeters in length, and they are covered in many small, hair-like structures called chaetae. These chaetae are specialized bristles that are involved in locomotion, defense, and other functions. These bristles are composed of a mineralized structure that is formed through the process of biomineralization. Not much research has been performed to date on the structure and mineralization of the chaetae. We have preliminary revealed that the mineral is organized in a beautiful 3D hexagonal packing along the fibers and that other than calcite various unknown mineral phases exist.      Herein we propose to study the 3D structural organization along the fiber via SAXS\/WAX on the microdiffrcation beamline ID13 as well as the mineral composition lattice strains in the mineral on ID22. In situ kinetics of the strain relaxation and crystallization of the amorphous phase will also be carried out. ","689":"We propose to investigate the dynamics of ultrafast and non-reversible photo-induced phase transitions using the \u201cstreaming crystallography\u201d technique developed during our previous beamtimes (CH-6492 and CH-6162), that enables real time study of photo-induced phase transitions in molecular materials, within or outside thermal hysteresis. Previous experiments on Co-doped MnFe Prussian Blue Analogues revealed that conversion is completed within 200 ps, with global symmetry change driven by elastic cooperativity. Investigations at variable temperatures show only a very gentle effect in the transformation dynamics. To get better control of the phase transition, we propose here to modulate elastic properties of the crystals, by varying its composition (through doping) and by switching from bulk to surface excitation. Additionally, measurements will be performed on spin-crossover compounds, where the phase transition can occur with or without symmetry change, depending on composition.","690":"The Shockley-Queisser limit sets an upper bound on the efficiency of single junction solar cells of ~30%. Singlet Fission (SF) offers the potential to overcome this limitation as SF materials can yield two charge carriers for each absorbed photon. TIPS-pentacene (TIPS=6,13-bis-(triisopropylsilylethynyl)) is an extensively studied SF chromophore as it has been reported to approach a 200% triplet yield. However, the microscopic mechanism of the formation and the atomic structure of the triplet states are still largely unknown. Measuring the photoinduced transient structures will provide a much-needed test of the atomistic mechanism of SF in organic chromophores, paving the way for a rational design of SF materials in solar cell application. We propose to directly probe the molecular structure and dynamics involved in SF of TIPS-pentacene in solution with Time-Resolved X-ray Solution Scattering (TR-XSS) using the Time-Resolved Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (TR-WAXS) setup at ID09.","691":"The rational design of efficient light-activated functional molecules requires the understanding of their potential energy surfaces (PES), but the ones obtained with quantum chemical (QC) tools are hard to verify with available spectroscopy tools. The combination of X-ray spectroscopy and scattering has been shown to reveal intricate details of the PES, and this is the approach we wish to exploit here. We propose to study modified Fe(II)-polypyridine complexes, model systems for light-switchable molecular magnets, for which QC calculations suggest the feasibility of altering the excited state PES by ligand substitution. Transient optical absorption shows that the lifetime of the excited quintet state changes upon substitution, suggesting variation of the energy landscape. The proposed experiment will test the quintet-singlet energy gap (beyond the molecular structures). Such confirmation of the systematically varied PES shall help us to design molecules with optimized functionality.","692":"Zeolites such as ZSM-5 are effective catalysts for the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignocellulosic biomass to high value monoaromatic hydrocarbons e.g., benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) that can act as drop-in substitutes for fossil-derived chemicals. Studies using model compounds have shown that a hydrocarbon pool is formed during CFP, and that Fe sites promote the formation of monoaromatic species.1 However, direct observation of the hydrocarbon pool is challenging since formed intermediates are dispersed in the microporous solid zeolite, and the electronic interaction between Fe sites and the formed hydrocarbon pool remains unstudied. We propose to perform operando C K-edge X-ray Raman and simultaneous Fe K\u03b2 and valence to core emission spectroscopy using the newly available Von-Hamos spectrometer, in order to probe ZSM-5 and Fe modified ZSM-5 catalysts for insight into CFP hydrocarbon pool chemistry.","693":"The aim of the experiment is to perform a of X-ray Raman Scattering (XRS) spectroscopy investigation at the Ce-N4-N5 edge on Ce1-xGdxO2-d solid solutions (x=0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75), to contribute to the comprehension of the oxygen vacancy concentration and of the valence state of cerium in pure and Gd doped Ceria functional materials under reducing conditions, i.e. in operating conditions when adopted as a solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.

In order to understand the mechanisms at stake, we will follow the time-resolved behaviour of Pt and Ir oxidation state within the NPs in few seconds to minutes, which corresponds to the time range of the H2 starvation. Due to the close energy range for Pt (LIII 11.564 eV) and for Ir (LIII 11.215 eV), we will only evaluate the Quick-XANES data as a function of the potential. From the Quick-XANES data, PCA and LCF analysis will be performed to monitor the potential and time dependent changes in oxidation state and ligand environment of the Ir and Pt atoms in the bimetallic NPs during HOR and OER.","695":"Existing studies of Haber-Bosch catalysts for synthesis of ammonia were so far not performed anywhere near operation conditions which makes the real structure of catalytically active species and promotors largely unknown. This proposal aims at studying the structure of Ru and Cs by X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the as-received, activated, and working promoted Ru\/Cs\/MgO and unpromoted Ru\/MgO catalysts during NH3 synthesis at high pressure. As a result, correlations between structure of Ru and Cs species and their performance in the NH3 synthesis, also in deactivating gas mixtures containing O2 impurities, will be obtained. This will allow knowledge-based design of the new generation catalysts with lower energy requirements and enabling decentralized ammonia synthesis.","696":"The soluble methane monooxygenase P intermediate formed after O2 uptake is proposed to convert into the active Q via a transient protonated P\u2019 species. Stable molecular models are valuable to establish spectroscopic and structural markers. A model for P comprising of a \u03bc-1,2-peroxo diferric complex 1 was isolated, its one-electron oxidized product 2 and its protonated diferric product 3. While the current evidences support the \u03bc-1,2-peroxo and \u03bc-1,2-hydroperoxo motifs respectively, structural verification is lacking. The stability of 3 enabled the unprecedented isolation of a model for P\u2019. Without stabilizing groups, a highly reactive model species 5 is formed, which is a model for Q. Fe K-edge K\u03b1-HERFD XAS will provide us with the required sensitivity and selectivity to the samples\u2019 signal to allow for establishing reference information on the electronic structure (from pre-edge features) and geometry (from EXAFS) of functional models of all sMMO intermediates.","697":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate H2 and CO-induced phenomena occurring at Pt- and Ru-based catalysts by time-resolved XAS experiments in the liquid-phase. Previous multi-technique experiments, comprising Pt L3-edge XAS (CH-5204), revealed that Pt nanoparticles (NPs) restructure in the presence of H2 in the gas-phase; a similar behaviour is expected also for Ru, which is more reactive than Pt. Moreover, in a very recent high-energy XRPD\/PDF experiment (CH-6371), we found that both catalysts restructure in the presence of H2 also in liquid phase, at a short time-scale (1-2 min). Here we want to perform time-resolved Pt L3-edge and Ru K-edge XAS to collect complementary information on adsorbate-induced NPs restructuring, extending the interest from H2 to CO. The experiment will help in bridging the gap of knowledge between phenomena occurring in gas and liquid phase, which are relevant both for fundamental research and for industrial catalysis.","698":"Pt and Pt alloy catalysts are used at the cathode of proton exchange membrane fuel cells to reduce O2 into H2O. Their activities are dependent on the O adsorption energy EOads, which is governed by its d-band centre according to the DFT calculations. Alloys raise the d-band centre and therefore reduce EOads, improving the activity in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, this understanding is mainly gained from steady state measurement and is lack of measurement on the surface dynamics. Here we will measure the transient catalyst response upon rapid switching of electrochemical potentials via Pt L3 and Co K edge quick XAFS measurement. This study will determine 1) the rate of Pt and Co oxidation and reduction upon different electrochemical potentials; 2) the dynamics of Pt and Co local coordination environment; 3) the dynamics of surface adsorbed O species via difference XANES. This study is of fundamental importance to determine and quantify the rate of surface reaction.","699":"Artificial photosynthesis is one of the most promising alternatives to the combustion fossil fuels.

Those cathode materials work extraordinarily well with monovalent ions and also show promising results in the multivalent case as demonstrated in our previous studies using a new a solid-state synthesis. Yet, their redox mechanisms are not fully understood, especially in extended cycles with capacity dropping. We apply to use synchrotron tender XES to investigate the redox behaviors of both transition metal cations and the S anions in response to Mg insertion and extraction, and compare their contributions to the change of capacity. The findings will help understand fundamental mechanisms beyond intercalation within the SCAR-based cathode materials, and aid the discovery of novel compositions with enhanced properties, enabling faster diffusion and extending the portfolio of Mg cathode materials.

XANES and EXAFS results of the Ce and Pd will enable further rational design of the catalyst.","702":"Mo\/ZSM-5 has been widely studied in literature for methane dehydroaromatization. However, the Mo\/ZSM-5 catalyst deactivates quickly due to surface coke formation and the formation of MoCx particles during the reaction. Alternative transition metals such as W, V, Cr, and Fe that have been proven their ability to convert methane into aromatics are being studied to gain a better understanding of their function. In this study, we want to establish structure-performance relationships of  W\/ZSM-5 during the MDA process. This catalyst can achieve similar benzene yields as Mo\/ZSM-5, but there is a knowledge gap on the structural evolution of W\/ZSM-5 during both the activation of the catalyst and the reaction itself. This operando HERFD XANES\/XES study will yield essential information on the evolution of the W sites under reaction conditions. Combining these results with online catalytic performance measurements will gain new insights in the field of methane conversion into valuable compounds.","703":"Dual Atom catalysts (DACs) have the potential to to achieve exceptional activity in many reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction, which is essential for the efficient production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. DACs based on environmental friendly materials can be produced starting from single metal catalysts through anodic electrolysis in presence of impurities of a second metal. DACs have demonstrated improved performances compared to single metal materials, suggesting the existence of localized synergistic effects. Such mechanisms are not yet understood and the DACs atomic structure ex-situ and in working conditions are still highly debated. A XAS experiment in operando conditions will allow to investigate the process of in situ DACs formation and the structural and chemical changes trigged by the electrochemical potential. The results will allow to obtain structure-activity information and unravel the details of the catalytic mechanism.","704":"We like to study how the defect sites in ceria and active metal sites activate CO2 and dissociate H2. Why is bimetallic performing better than monometallic? This information is critical to understand the mechanism and why such dramatic improvement in activity was observed, and XAS studies will help us answer these questions. We will carry out a multi-edge (Ce L3, Fe, Ni, Zn) HERFD-XAS study to understand the modification of the electronic structure as a function of the sample composition, sample morphology and under in situ conditions. Particularly interesting are the 2p-4f transitions into the Ce L3 pre-edge that reveal the number of 4f electrons.","705":"Nitrogenase, the only natural enzyme to reduce nitrogen to ammonia. In the nitrogenase catalytic cycle, H+\/e- are sequentially delivered to its active site, however open questions exist as to the specific sites of these protonation steps. The probable sites are thought to be the bridging sulfides and the iron centres. Recently researchers were successful in selectively replacing the sulfide bridges within the FeMoco active site by Se, which provides a selective spectroscopic handle, allowing the bridging Se to serve as a unique spectator for the two irons it interacts with and thus enabling protonation at the Se and\/or Fe in different intermediates to be experimentally probed.  Herein, we intend to pursue selenium Kalpha HERFD XAS, together with EXAFS and Se valence to core X-ray emission spectroscopy (VtC XES) in order to obtain electronic and geometric structural insights into the changes that occur at the FeMo-co active site of molybdenum nitrogenase.","706":"The purpose of this proposal is to use high-resolution X-ray diffuse scattering to study the disordered structure of organic quantum materials and to build an understanding of their true local structure.

Now, we've synthesized 2D films of MOFs such as UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, and Zn2(bim)4, alongside COFs, achieving superior molecular separation. However, their crystal structure remains undetermined. This proposal seeks beamtime to elucidate the structures of these newly synthesized 2D films using advanced techniques previously successful at the BM01 facility of ESRF. Additionally, we aim to explore the novel heterostructured 2D ZIF\/COF film, emphasizing the substrate's role in defining 2D film structures.","708":"Li-ion batteries are the leading technology for electrochemical energy storage, but there are still processes occurring inside the battery, that are not understood, both during cycling and when the battery is resting. One of these processes is the relaxation of the active materials when the cycling is stopped and the battery is resting, which we recently have shown for graphite (Figure 1). It is very likely that similar processes occur for many different battery materials where metastable phases relax into more stable phases as soon as the electrochemistry is paused. These relaxations could occur differently at different cycling rates, and at different state of charge. Studying these processes is crucial for increasing our understanding of data from so called \u201cpost mortem\u201d studies in which material is extracted from batteries after stopping cycling. We plan to study the relaxation processes in well-known battery materials like NMC811, NMC611 and NCA at different cycling rates.","709":"The present proposal aims at investigating gas sorption in a novel type of porous hydride, namely tetramethyldodecaborate, (Me4N)2B12H12.

Ammonium fluoride NH4F is a promising candidate to be used as a precursor for the synthesis of N-F, H-F, and H-N-F compounds. However, its stability and chemical reactivity under high-pressure high-temperature conditions has not been studied yet. \r\nHere, we propose a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of the H-N-F system at pressures up to 120 GPa at ID11.

However, designing the properties of MOF glasses remains challenging because they are mostly prepared using top-down approaches, and only a few selected MOFs show a stable liquid state while most of them decompose upon heating. Moreover, proton-conductive MOF glasses, to date, are not water-stable, which limits their applications. Here we propose an entirely novel bottom-up strategy to synthesize tailored Zr-MOF glasses for achieving proton conductivity and water stability. The MOF glasses were synthesized by crosslinking Zr-clusters, leveraging modular building blocks such as pre-designed functional linkers, precise control over local geometry, and post-synthesis modifications to achieve proton conductivity, thermal stability, processability, and water stability.","715":"The aim of the experiment is to perform a of X-ray Diffraction investigation on Ce1-xGdxO2-d solid solutions (x=0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00), to contribute to the comprehension of the oxygen vacancy concentration and distribution in pure and Gd doped Ceria functional materials under reducing conditions, i.e. in operating conditions when adopted as a solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.

Ideally, multiple full diffraction patterns are collected as a function of incident X-ray energy across the absorption edge of one of the elements in the sample. However, the widespread use of this technique has been limited in part by time-consuming data collection, and in part by challenging data analysis. Here we want to collect DAFS data on the known mixed valence state materials, GaCl2 and Sb2O4 to test our novel way of analysing DAFS data, taking advantage of the new capabilities at ID22 and improvements in software and computing power.","718":"Solid-solid phase-change materials (SSPCMs) are promising for next generation thermal energy storage applications, as they present several advantages over solid-liquid PCMs including safety (no spillage of hot liquid), lower thermal expansion, lower corrosiveness, and no need for encapsulation. Solid-solid transitions occur from RT ordered phases to orientationally disordered high-temperature phases that lie at the boundary between liquids and solids. Adoption of SSPCMs for practical applications require understanding of their structural stabilities. The proposal will investigate two molybdate salts with high latent heat of phase transitions. Both Na2MoO4 and K2MoO4 have rich phase diagrams, and both undergo 3 reversible phase transitions before melting. Variable-temperature powder x-ray diffraction will be conducted to establish relations between all the phases. Moreover, thermal expansion coefficients of phases, and thermal displacement parameter of individual atoms will be derived.","719":"Our lab. XRD indicates that rare earth Gd metal undergoes slightly Bragg peak broadening at low temperature, indicating a possible new phase at low temperature that has not been reported before. Our first-principles many-body calculations for the correlated 4f-shell of Gd predict that an orthorhombic phase could be stabilized by magneto-elastic forces due to ordering of Gd quadrupolar moments. Further high-resolution synchrotron XRD at ID22 is highly preferred to directly characterize the low-temperature structural distortion and reveal the low-symmetric structure. The determination of the true structure of pure Gd metal is important to further understand the nature of rare earth, such as electron structure, energy bands, phonons, and magnetism.","720":"This proposal aims to elucidate the structure of zinc sites incorporated into several Al-rich zeolitic topologies: MFI, FER, and MOR.

Zinc sites can exist as extra-framework positions or replace silicon within the zeolite framework as T-atoms. However, the precise details regarding the nature of these sites and their behavior during the proposed reaction remain unknown, primarily due to the low zinc concentration (3 wt.%) and only partial substitution for silicon.

Of the most successfully applied metals for this reaction, Fe-based catalysts are considered the most robust, environmentally friendly and earth abundant. Fe has though a tendency to form a wide range of poorly crystalline carbides (FexCy where x > y and 1<x<5) under non-oxidative reaction conditions and therefore offers more scope for tuning the catalyst composition for optimal performance. The work aims to employ operando XRD to investigate the nature and type of Fe species that form during pre-activation and under reaction conditions, and their relationship with both methane activation and the selectivity to solid carbonaceous products.

However, the development of PEMWE is hindered by the low efficiency of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), currently catalyzed by IrOx particles. The annealing of IrOx electrocatalysts has been shown to improve stability at the cost of decreased OER activity. This tradeoff is in response to the annealing's effects on the morphology and the nature of the surface oxides2,3. To determine which parameter (the material structure4, the initial Ir oxidation state5, or both) controls these two antagonist properties, we have synthesized a library of IrOx nanocatalysts with tailored crystallite size, Ir oxidation state, and degree of crystallinity.

In this proposal we aim to investigate magneto-chiral dichroism in the hard X-ray range (XMChD) in the lantanide complexes with helicenes - strongly chiral organic ligands with axial chirality.\r\nThese measurements will show if Ln-helicene compounds are good candidates for XMChD and will help us to understand the factors relevant to get strong effect for new compounds, that will be designed in the future.","736":"In the last years, n-butanol has gained increasing attention due to its potential to act as biofuel and to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with transportation. Despite its advantages, there are still challenges that need to be addressed and research and development efforts continue to focus on improving the production efficiency and economic viability of butanol as a biofuel. In this project, we have benefited from reticular chemistry and we have inserted catalytic Pd sites in the pores of the well-known UiO-66 MOF. While our compounds are able to catalyse the ethanol to n-butanol reaction, the available techniques do not allow to determine the precise role of the catalytic sites and the reaction mechanisms. Thus, we propose to use X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) and Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) to gain structural information (quantification of PdII and Pd0 atoms, determination of their environments, etc) on our MOFs.","737":"A novel family of chiral SMM molecules will be investigated here at the level of a monolayer deposit assembled on Au (111) via thermal sublimation in order to\r\nevaluate if, in agreement with the reports on bulk, the magnetization dynamics is strongly influenced by the specific arrangement of the molecules in the lattice.\r\nThe demonstration that a chiral SMM can be assembled on surface will open additional perspectives for the development of multifunctional hybrid devices for\r\nspintronics and quantum computing.","738":"The design of highly performing anodes for Na-Ion Batteries is a mandatory step for their commercialization. Here the study of new compositions of High Entropy Nasicon (NA Super Ionic CONductors) with formula NaM2(PO4)3 with M = Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Nb, Cr, V, Ti is proposed by means of XAS techniques to identify the electrochemical role of each metal centre. The materials will be investigated under working conditions of the cell vs Na. This will allow for the i) determination of the correlation between each potential step to the relative M(n+1)\/Mn+ couple, ii) follow the changes in the local structure during sodium insertion\/extraction iii) establishment of the electrode working mechanism.","739":"We recently proposed a new synthesis route to prepare a variety of carbon-nitride-based nanotubes films (CNNTs), possessing one-dimensional hollow nanostructure, high surface-to-volume ratio and abundant active sites, on Cu-Zn alloy substrate. These materials can have importan applications in photocatalysis, photonics and energy storage because of their semiconductive nature, and abundant nitrogen-metal (Zn) coordination sites. In order to investigate the growth mechanism of CNNTs and the interaction between Zn and conjugated C-N networks, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments are of importance to explore the electronic structure and local coordination state of Zn species in CNNTs. The experiment is complicated by the fact that the film thikness is lower than the probing depth of X-rays at the Zn K-edge. Here, we propose to solve this problem by detecting XAS in the total electron yield mode.","740":"A XAS experiment is proposed on a new family of Pt-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in low-T fuel cell. This family exhibits a hierarchical core\u2212shell support, wherein a carbon nitride shell stabilizes the catalyst sites in unique coordination nests. The catalyst is in form of Pt-Ni alloy clusters (size 1-5 nm), and the specific synthesis procedure ensures exceptional performances, since the strong catalyst-support interactions, likely mediated by N atoms, inhibit the leaching of metal species and particle agglomeration during operation. The aim is to measure the local order around the metal catalyst, characterizing both the nanoalloy and the cluster-matrix interaction, as a function of the Pt fraction and of the synthesis conditions (easily scalable for industrial fabrication), to understand how it is related to the ORRs performance.","741":"Silver-based nanoparticle catalysts supported on alpha alumina are widely used for ethylene oxide production. Caesium alkali promoters, such as Cs oxide and Cs rhenate, are essential for improving selectivity. However, the molecular and electronic details of Cs species remain unknown. X-ray absorption spectroscopy with high-energy resolution fluorescence detection offers a powerful means to characterize highly diluted Cs species. By studying Cs oxide and Cs rhenate formulations under reaction conditions relevant to EO synthesis, we can determine for the first time the atomic structure of Cs species and possibly their interactions with silver surfaces. Gaining fundamental insights into the states of Cs promoters will enable the design of more effective EO catalysts.","742":"Lanthanides are ubiquitous in modern technologies from energy conversion devices to optoelectronics. The localized nature of the f-orbitals underpins the useful magnetic and electronic properties these applications rely on but also limits the electronic structural role of the lanthanide element. The application of pressure fundamentally changes this electronic structure signature of lanthanides as valence states become more delocalized. We propose to probe the orbital specific nature of these changes and transitions across a series of lanthanide molecules and materials using HERFD XAS. Elucidating the combined effect of mechanical and chemical factors will help deconvolute the interactions underpinning emergent behaviors such as magnetism. Developing such mechanochemical intuition promises improved design principles for synthesizing new magnetic materials.","743":"The electronic structure of lanthanide materials inherits on-site correlations and unquenched orbital degrees of freedom from atomic f-electron states. In the most stable trivalent oxidation state (Ln3+), the core-like 4f orbitals are usually only weakly perturbed by the crystal field (CF) yielding anisotropic magnetic moments. Although covalent metal-ligand interactions involving the 4f shell are generally weak in Ln3+ systems, this paradigm breaks down for Ln4+ ions as 4f orbitals hybridize with the valence orbitals of the ligands analogous to transition metals. The unusual nature of Ln4+ ions have significant effects on the electronic structure of bulk materials as evidenced in PrBa2Cu3O7 where in superconductivity is suppressed and has been attributed to 4f-2p hybridization in the Pr-O bond. Therefore, to understand the electronic structure of tetravalent lanthanides, we propose to use soft x-ray RIXS and HERFD at L3 edges to probe covalency in Pr-O bond.

For this purpose, we would like to perform systematic operando XAS and XRD experiments during different reaction conditions simulating daily start-up and shut-down (DSS) operation (variation in temperature and gas atmosphere). We plan to monitor the structural evolution of the active species by XAS measurements at the Ni K and Pt L3 edges, while the overall phase changes due to de-alloying and re-incorporation in the support material will be tracked by X-ray diffraction measurements at selected stages of the experiments. After focusing on the support role in our previous proposal (CH-6791, to be performed in October 2023), we now aim to elucidate the effect of the Ni-Pt alloying degree on catalyst activity and stability.","746":"The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol allows converting one of the major greenhouse gases (CO2) combined with CO2 capture provides a carbon-neutral source of fuels and platform chemicals. This project aims to understand the structure of active sites and structural dynamics in Pd-In-based catalysts for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Specifically, the questions we want to address are: What is the role and the stability of a PdIn alloy and InOx species under CO2 hydrogenation? And what are the structural dynamics that drive the high performance of Pd-In-based catalysts?  To answer these questions, we design a series of operando + transient experiments using XAS and XRD on a model catalyst system. In and Pd K-edges XAS + XRD studies will provide information about the Pd and In electronic and local-to-average geometrical structure under reaction which will be linked to the online monitored catalytic activity. ","747":"The aim of this work is to investigate using combined XAFS\/XRD under operando conditions the nature and type of Ni species (oxidation state of Ni and its location on the perovskite A or B sites) that are present in the mixed-metal perovskite catalysts LaTi1-xNixO3 and LaFe1-xNixO3, the nature of the Ni species that form during initial reduction (fully or partially reduced Ni metal), under reaction conditions and after regeneration. The results obtained will aid in the design of new catalysts for dry methane reforming, which is of major industrial interest.","748":"The aim of this proposal is to use synchrotron radiation to solve by temperature-dependent powder XRD (TD-PXRD), total scattering analysis (PDF) and EXAFS the structure of hybrid organic-inorganic materials formulated (CnH2n+1-NH3)2MIICl4 (n = 6, 12, 13; M = Mn, Cu, Zn). The thermally-induced phase transitions are associated with strong reorganizations of the aliphatic chains, dynamic disorder and present high enthalpies of transformation. For this reason, this family of materials is promising for thermal energy storage applications.","749":"The oxidative activation of Cu-exchanged zeolites with O2 is a crucial step in tailoring the performance of the material in the conversion of CH4 to CH3OH. However, most studies focus on the reaction with CH4, leaving key aspects of the O2 activation process unrevealed. Time-resolved in situ Cu K-edge XAS is a versatile technique to determine the oxidation state of Cu species as well as changes in the local environment upon exposure to O2. Therefore, the scope of this proposal is to study the processes taking place during the activation of three different Cu-containing zeolite topologies, namely MOR, CHA, and MFI, to assess the structural parameters of active sites and their precursors. The three frameworks are known to stabilize chemically different monomeric and dimeric Cu(II) active sites, making them suitable model systems to study the formation of Cu(II) species. The advance in understanding the active site evolution will enable an additional rationale for materials design.","750":"Using combined X-ray diffraction (XRD), total scattering (TS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) experiments, we want to study the formation of high entropy oxides (HEO) in a sol-gel synthesis. HEOs are a new type of material containing five or more metal cations in a single-phase crystal structure. We have synthesized a series of HEOs in a spinel structure based on 1st-row transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), which have immense potential as e.g., catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We aim to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the oxide formation pathways in these multi-metallic systems. The combined in situ XRD, TS, and XANES studies will allow us to simultaneously follow changes in the average and local structures as well as oxidation states during the transformation of the amorphous precursors into crystalline products. Such studies have previously shown to give unique insight into the materials formation pathways of novel high entropy materials.","751":"Two major greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2, can be converted to syngas, an important building block in chemical industry, through an integrated carbonate looping-methane dry reforming process (CaL-DRM). Pivotal role to the proposed scheme has the development of bifunctional materials (BFMs) that combine high and stable CO2 capture capacity and catalytic activity in a single pellet. The aim of this proposal is to investigate with in situ techniques the structure and the local environment of active Ni that defines the enhanced catalytic performance.","752":"Recently it has been shown that high pressure (gigapascal) hydrogenations can afford novel semiconducting hydridosilicate compounds \u2013 such as K2SiH6, Na3SiH7, and BaSiH6 \u2013 featuring octahedral [SiH6]2- species in which Si attains a hypervalent bonding situation. The emerging family of hydridosilicates suggests that also the isoelectronic hydridophosphates (featuring hypervalent [PH6]-) with potentially interesting properties may exist and become accessible from gigapascal hydrogenations. Here we propose to perform in situ synchrotron diffraction studies of reaction mixtures AH + P + H2 (A = K, Cs) and KP + H2 at pressures up to 12 GPa using ID06-LVP at the ESRF. The aim is to exploit the well-controlled p, T environment in large volume press experiments \u2013 in combination with angle-dispersive diffraction \u2013 to unfold formation conditions and phase relations of ternary phosphorous hydrides A\u2013P\u2013H as well as to elucidate their structures.","753":"The aim of this proposal is to synthesize and study the crystal chemistry and high-pressure behaviour of transition metal's halides Me-Hal (Me = Fe or Y, Hal = F, Cl, Br, I) in diamond anvil cells at pressures up to 160 GPa by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) at ID15b beamline, that will allow to produce new compounds and to understand how high pressure can alter their structures and tune physico-chemical properties. Moreover, the analysis of the phase diagrams of iron halides at high pressures may provide an opportunity to take an important step forward in understanding the missing halogen paradox in the Earth.","754":"The goal of this proposal is to characterize the structural evolution as a function of pressure at room temperature of a prototype 2D chiral perovskite, namely\r\nClMBA2PbI4 (ClMBA= chloro-methylbenzylammonium) in the two enantiopure samples (R and S) and in the racemate. The structural study will be coupled\r\nto the spectroscopic measurements as a function of pressure, in particular circular photoluminescence (CPL), to fully characterize the behaviour of these low\r\ndimensional hybrid perovskites upon compression and unveil the evolution of non-linear optical properties and chirality transfer induced by the chiral cation.","756":"The proposal is aimed at investigating the high pressure and high temperature chemistry of P and H2, exploring the new perspectives and questions opened by the direct synthesis of PH3 from the elements and by the discovery of the crystalline vdW compound (PH3)2H2.

The study addresses fundamental issues about carbonic acid and is relevant to astrochemical purposes and to fundamental chemistry regarding binary ice mixtures. ","758":"Na-based solid-state batteries (SSBs) offer high energy density and safety, which are among the main goals of current battery research. Unlike Li-SSBs, it is not possible to use Na-metal electrodes, so a novel carbon framework structure is used as the anode, which prevents direct contact with the highly Na+ conducting sulfur solid electrolytes (SE). However, Na-SSBs undergo large volume changes and this process is accompanied by cracking, especially at the interfaces. In this study, we will use in-situ synchrotron computed tomography (SCT) to study novel Na-SSBs as a function of pressure to get inside local volume changes and resulting cracks, displacements that are often associated with plating\/stripping of Na. Of particular interest is the question of the reversibility of these processes. These questions can only be answered by SCT, as other methods are either destructive and\/or don't allow such high pressures.","759":"Assessing intracellular O2 resolved spatially and temporally in the fundamentally and biotechnologically important microalgae Chlamydomonas reinharditii is crucial for understanding their physiology. We developed a luminescent sensor for O2 made of a platinum complex-labelled polymeric nanoparticle which is successfully internalized in C. reinhardtii cells and whose signal can be read out without significantly interfering with the light-driven photosynthesis. This sensor is prone to provide unprecedented dynamic measurements of O2 concentrations within photosynthetic cells and bring new insights about the complex balance between consumption and production of O2 at the subcellular level. Yet, reaching this goal requires to precisely localize the sensor within the complex 3D ultrastructure of the microalgae. The proposed correlative acquisition of epifluorescence images and XRF tomograms at ID16A on cryogenized C. reinhardtii cells will enable us to perform such a sensor localization.","760":"Lithium solid-state batteries (SSBs), via the implementation of Li-metal anodes, offer, in theory, a substantial increase in gravimetric energy density compared to Li-ion batteries. While developments are promising, SSBs still suffer from a range of problems limiting their utilisation. Problems largely originate from a chemo-mechanical degradation at buried interfaces upon cycling. Here, via the development of miniaturized SSBs (Li \u01c0 LiPON \u01c0 LiCoO2) and their examination using Operando Near-Field Ptychographic X-ray computed NanoTomography (NF-PXCT) we would like to further our understanding of these processes by imaging entire SSBs with nanometre resolution.","761":"Ordered mesoporous silica, such as SBA-15, are versatile materials for e.g. drug delivery. The materials are synthesized in a sol-gel process, where micelles evolve from spheres to cylinders, and arranges in a hexagonal structure while a silica network is arranging cooperatively around them. We will investigate how the addition of 1) NH4-salts, and 2) an organosilane (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)) affects the material formation, both during the micelle evolution and the particles growth. We hereby propose to couple in situ time-resolved USAXS\/SAXS to identify the self-assembly mechanisms taking place by probing both mesoscopic and the colloidal size region. The data will be correlated with in situ IR-spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) using the same experimental setup, where details of the formation of the silica framework are revealed. Unlocking the material formation mechanism will enable a more rational design of drug carriers and medical implants with tailored drug release.","762":"Magnetotactic bacteria sustainably produce chains of magnetite nanoparticles with exceptional properties. Inspired by these bacteria, we developed a synthetic route emulating the bacteria\u2019s proteins with charged polymers inducing a biomineralization-reminiscent crystal formation. Using in-situ SAXS and ex-situ cryo-XANES, we elucidated the gained control via a kinetic stabilization of a transient iron phase, also observed in the bacteria. While new evidence shows that this stabilization is based on an electrostatic polymer-precursor interaction, different polymers show deviations in the final nanoparticle morphology. We accordingly propose an in situ SAXS study to monitor the formation of magnetite nanoparticles, with a primary focus on characterizing the weakly scattering, pre-nucleation iron species. This study aims to understand the effect of different polycations on the kinetic stabilization of low-density iron, particularly considering variations in polymer molecular weight.","763":"In this project, we successfully established and optimized an unprecedented protocol for forming multivariate TbxEuyMOFs inside liposomes to achieve colour-tuneable luminescent nanomaterials (TbxEuyMOF@Liposome). Our approach allows finely controlling the mole ratio for each lanthanide and monitoring the formation kinetics of the multivariate nanoparticles. This proposal aims to evaluate the growth and structural arrangement evolution of TbxEuyMOF nanoparticles inside the liposome using in situ experiments on the SAXS\/WAXS beamline.","764":"The fabrication of micro and mesoscale 3D shaped crystalline materials remains an exquisite challenge for materials science. A prominent bottom-up approach is the self-assembly of silica biomorphs. They are composed of crystalline carbonate nano-rods embedded into an amorphous silica matrix. A striking feature are their different, curved morphologies. Understanding the emergence, respective driving forces and resulting material properties are still open questions, which hinder a more wide-spread application of these structures.\r\nHere, we propose to address these questions with multi-modal x-ray texture tomography at ID13 to understand the crystalline make-up via texture tomography, and the associated microstructure (particle size, strain, dislocation) patterns via 3D Rietveld refinement. \r\nFrom these results, we aim at deriving more general insights into how strain, crystallographic texture and dislocations shape these curved structures. ","765":"Due to thermal decomposition, the liquid structures of salts and salt-rich DESs are inaccessible. By combining ultra-fast scanning calorimetry with micro-XRD we can overcome this limitation and experimentally follow the evolution of the liquid structure with temperature and the addition of a molecular compound. Together with state-of-the-art MD simulations, the dependency of the DES\u2019s liquid structure (long-range polar\/apolar domains, ion charge alternation, and short-range intramolecular structural features) on the chemical nature of its constituents is unveiled. Such insights are critical towards understanding the extraordinary melting point depressions and solvent performance observed for DESs.","766":"The fundamental scientific question, addressed in the current proposal is the interplay between structural and electronic degrees of freedom, their constraints and their role in improving electron transfer (ET) properties in Cu complexes. We aim at disentangling structural and electronic effects by studying model complexes with dominating influence of one or the other type of modification. Even though the changes of different nature are applied, they lead to a similar improvement in ET abilities compared to the unmodified complex. Unique capability of ID09 beamline to combine structurally sensitive Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and electronically sensitive X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) will allow separating and resolving the effects of structural and electronic constraints.","767":"We propose to investigate the formation of aurophilic bonds in solvated dinuclear Au(I) complexes upon electronic transition to the emissive excited state. Optical studies suggest the dependency on the solvent environment and counter ions [1-3] while the exact electronic and structural origins of enhanced aurophilicity remain unclear. By combining pump-probe wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in solution we aim to visualize drastic changes in molecular structure and local redistribution of electron density upon charge transfer when the weak aurophilic bond is formed in the triplet excited state. Moreover, with the X-ray scattering method it will be possible to monitor rearrangements of solvent molecules around the excited solute and reveal the critical role of the environment affecting the aurophilicity.","768":"In view of on-purpose propylene production, novel catalysts for CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) were developed in the form of hydrotalcite-derived mixed oxides, containing Fe, Mg and Al. In addition, incorporation of Ca was found to improve the materials\u2019 redox properties, which positively affects the CO2-PDH activity. To further design these non-noble and earth-abundant catalysts, structure-activity-selectivity relations need to be developed. A detailed understanding is required of how the different elements in the catalyst interact under mixed oxidizing and reducing conditions - representative for CO2-PDH - and how this affects the sites selective to CO2-PDH. To this end, a combined study of X-ray Raman Spectroscopy (XRS), Emission Spectroscopy (XES) and Diffraction (XRD) for in-situ characterization of the MgFe(Ca)AlO catalysts is proposed.","769":"Post transition metal-based electrocatalysts are known for the selective electroreduction of CO2 (CO2ER) to formate. The In-Bi catalyst, composed by alloys of Indium and Bismuth, shows great selectivity and stability (\u2248100% faradaic efficiency over 24 hours at \u2248100mA\/cm2) before deactivation. Understanding the activation mechanism is crucial for preventing deactivation. Literature suggests Indium to catalyse CO2ER via a metastable oxide layer, while the oxides role in Bismuth catalysts is unclear. Our preliminary X-ray diffraction (XRD) data on In-Bi samples suggest a de-alloying mechanism. We propose a combination of in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and XRD to reveal the role of oxides in the activation of the In-Bi electrocatalyst and to trace local environment and crystalline structure changes during catalysis. These insights will contribute to the scientific discussion on the mechanism of Indium and Bismuth in CO2ER, and to the industrial application of the In-Bi catalyst.","770":"CO2 hydrogenation is an important reaction to convert green H2 to chemicals. We have recently developed at Pt loaded MoOx\/Mo2N catalysts that achieved a catalytic activity of 2.43 \u00d7 10\u20124 mol gcat\u20121 s\u20121 at 350 C, which is much higher than other reported catalysts. In situ XAFS at Pt L3 edge suggests a mixed Pt metallic and PtOx species under steady state, with the Pt-Pt coordination numbers (C.N.) around 2.0 and Pt-O around 2.5. In situ Raman spectroscopy shows abundant surface oxygen vacancies (VO), suggesting a M-K mechanism that involves in the oxidation of Pt by CO2 and reduction of Pt with H2. Here we apply for the Pt L3 edge QXAFS study with modulation excitation of CO2 and H2 pulses. This study will measure the rate of Pt oxidation and reduction at different temperatures, achieving kinetic data of the half reaction. Comparing the data with full reaction will determine the rate limiting step, providing methods to further improving the rate of the reaction at low temperatures.","771":"Cost efficient  catalysts are in great demand for the CO2 hydrogenation into useful chemicals and fuels. Recently we prepared a high surface area LaNiO3 perovskite catalysts with up to 4 times higher activity than conventional Ni-supported on La2O3. Using in-situ NAP-XPS and XRD we demonstrated the transformation of LaNiO3 perovskite structure under reducing pre-treatment. However, XRD is not sensitive to the local electronic structure while NAP-XPS measurements are restricted to few mbar therefore limited by the so-called pressure gap. Therefore, we propose here an operando hard X-rays XAFS\/DRIFTS experiment of LaNiO3 perovskite catalysts to unlock the dynamic transformation of the LaNiO3 electronic and geometric structure upon reduction and CO2 hydrogenation reaction conditions. This knowledge will be combined with the valuable IR information on the produced chemical intermediates, with the ultimate goal of describing the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism.","772":"Actinides exhibit unique behaviour and unpredictable bonding trends thanks to a complex valence region which facilitates both 5f and 6d orbital participation in bonding, as well as, in certain cases, the \"pseudo-core\" 6p orbitals. Experimental access to the 6p orbitals is limited, and there have been no direct experimental observations of 6p metal-ligand bonding. We have identified that U M4,5-edge valence-to-core (V2C) resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at ID26 gives direct access to the 6p orbitals, showing sensitivity to their participation in bonding as well as probing the extent of 5f hybridisation with ligand valence orbitals. We propose a comprehensive V2C RIXS investigation into both 6p and 5f bonding across a series of molecular complexes including the highly covalent linear dioxo uranyl ion [O=U=O]2+, which is predicted by theory to exhibit significant 6p contributions to bonding.

By application of in-situ X-Ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy we hope to elucidate the electronic state and structure (XANES) of the catalyst materials. EXAFS will be used to compare interatomic distances (M-M, M-O) in the host structure (NiFe-LDH) with those in the NiFeX-LDHs, thus giving insight into the local structure of the catalyst and the influence of the guest species on the host.","774":"Metal oxides photoanodes, such as WO3\/BiVO4 heterostructures, represent the state of the art towards photoelectrochemical water splitting, but their efficiency is still hampered by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and limited charge separation efficiency. Mixed Cobalt-Iron co-catalysts proved to be effective to temper such issues, and operando XAFS analysis, mimicking the PEC illumination and bias conditions, demonstrated a powerful tool to probe the catalyst structural and electronic features in steady-state. However, as the catalytic site has limited lifetime before relaxation through charge transfer or recombination, sub-ms time resolution is required to probe it. Thus, time- and frequency- resolved operando PEC-XAFS measurements will provide a local structural basis for an understanding of the physical properties of this photocatalyst in real operating conditions, focusing on the structural dynamics of the catalyst upon modulation of the illumination source. ","775":"NH3 is one of the most important chemical products but only made at 400-500 C and 150-300 bar conditions due to the stable N2 molecule. Here we have developed a Ru-CeO2 catalyst with high activity under 1-10 bar. Kinetic study reveals a H-assisted N2 dissociation mechanism, with a volcano-type activity dependence on the N2 activation barrier and the H2 adsorption strength. To validate such mechanism and volcano trends, we need to understand: 1) How the Ru d band centre determines the N2 activation behaviours; 2) Does the d band centre change along with reaction conditions; 3) How does N=NH* formed on Ru surface. Here we apply for an in situ Ru L3 edge vtc- RIXS study to follow the dynamics of Ru d band and identify Ru-N=NH under NH3 synthesis conditions. This study utilizes the uniqueness of the in situ tender RIXS capability at ID26. It is also a perfect synergy between in situ RIXS study and experimental kinetic models, which is the first of its kind for NH3 chemistry.","776":"We have synthesized a series of Fe(III)- and Fe(IV)-bisamide complexes to systematically study ligand effects on electronic structures and bonding of the Fe-N4 cores. Herein, we propose to probe the valence electronic structures of these complexes using Fe KBeta x-ray emission (XES) and 1s3p resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Results from these experiments will yield insights that can facilitate our study of reactive intermediates in complex biocatalytic systems, and potentially provide guidance for the development of novel molecular catalysts in the future.

This study has three main aims: (i) to understand the nature of static correlated disorder as a function of temperature, field and molecular stereochemistry, (ii) to elucidate the effect of the correlated disorder on the dielectric properties of these materials and thus, (iii) to understand the role of composition and stacking geometry on the dielectric properties which make these materials so exciting.

We aim to study Pd NPs as we change the external applied potential causing the adsorption\/desorption of hydrogen, hydroxyl and the concomitant glycerol oxidation. However, before doing it, we need to tackle problems related to radiation damage, which are revealed by the formation of Pd hydrides at electrochemical potentials where the phenomena should not occur in HClO4 solutions. Pd hydride formation can be detected via X-ray diffraction. We can track the Pd hydride formation using different concentrations of glycerol. By doing that, we will check if the glycerol\u2019s ability as a radical trapping agent is able to mitigate the radiation damage. Glycerol is a special molecule in our case because it can act not only as a trapping agent, but also as the biomass being electrocatalytically oxidized in our system.\r\n","780":"Photo-switchable magnets offer unique magnetic memory storage capabilities. However, their technological application is hampered by low operating temperatures, with the best system to date showing photomagnetic switching only below 93 K. Further improvement of such photomagnetic systems is limited by poor understanding of the photoswitching mechanism in cyanometallate assemblies. Previous photocrystallographic studies for octacyanomolybdate(IV) led to the identification of light-induced Mo-CN bond breakage as the main cause of photomagnetic activity, but such behavior was never observed for octacyanotungstate(IV) compounds in the solid. The main difficulty in such studies is the polycrystalline nature of octacyanotungstate(IV) photomagnets. The aim of this proposal is to investigate structural changes with synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, for a new photomagnetic coordination polymers, which exhibit light-induced magnetic ordering at record temperatures up to 110 K.","781":"The present proposal aims at understanding gas sorption in interstitial voids within cristalline (Me4N)2SnX6 (X = halogen) derivatives. Despite the non-interconnected nature of these voids, our preliminary studies by lab in situ X-ray diffraction have shown that they are able to interact with gas molecules, leading to structural changes. Here we aim at studying the interaction of (Me4N)2SnX6 with Ar, Xe, Kr, CO2 and CH4 gas, to provide a clear view on the implicated mechanisms by means of in situ X-ray powder diffraction, enabling precise localisation of adsorption sites and sorbent-adsorbate interactions in these materials. This will ultimately enhance our understanding of the gas sorption in ionic materials possessing interstitial voids.","782":"Ternary compounds containing carbon and nitrogen such as cyanides [CN]- and carbodiimides [CN2]2-have been known for a long time and have plenty of applications. Recently, at mild pressures (25-54 GPa) we discovered the recoverable to ambient conditions [CN3]5- anion in the series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates. The next member of this C-N anion series\u2014ortho-nitridocarbonate [CN4]8- anion\u2014is hitherto unknown, although its stabilization is predicted in theoretical studies and expected at higher pressures. Here, we propose a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of La-C-N and Tb-C-N systems up to 150 GPa at ID11. The aims of the proposed experiments are a synthesis of new La-C-N and Tb-C-N solids at megabar pressure regime, characterization of their crystal chemistry and behavior upon decompression, tests of theoretical predictions, search for regularities in ternary carbonitride chemistry, and see the effect of lanthanide ion.","783":"In our recent investigations, we discovered a plethora of new rubidium\u2013nitrogen and cesium\u2013nitrogen compounds\u2014i.e. a staggering 11 new solids\u2014at pressures up to 50 GPa. However, no investigation on alkali metals\u2013N systems beyond 60 GPa has been reported in the literature, and there is no doubt that many more new alkali metals polynitrides remain to be discovered at these higher pressures. Through the investigation of the Rb\u2013N and Cs\u2013N systems up to 180 GPa, this proposal aims at forming compounds comprised of new exotic nitrogen species and assessing their recovery to ambient conditions. The solids\u2019 crystal structure will be determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, also employed to determine the novel materials\u2019 stability domain and recoverability to ambient conditions.","784":"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundant material in Universe, but their origin remain enigmatic. Recent studies indicate that PAHs may be product of the processes inside the planetary bodies. However, behaviour of PAHs under ultra-high pressure and high temperature conditions and in different chemical environment poorly understood. Previous studies were constrained within a relatively narrow pressure range. Therefore, we propose conducting a Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SCXRD) investigation of pyrene up to 100 GPa at ID11, employing laser heating techniques. Our aim is to explore novel C-H compounds as well as possible formation of C-N-H compounds at conditions of planetary interiors. The objectives of these proposed experiments include determining precise crystal structures and characterizing their crystal chemistry and compressional behaviour.","785":"The recently developed slow room-temperature synthesis of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) has provided an opportunity to study their growth mechanism in situ. However, the reaction pathway from molecular precursors to nuclei remains unclear. This project aims to: (i) determine whether LHPs precursors (PbBr2-TOPO) are free molecular species in solution or whether TOPO is organized in small micelles embedding PbBr2 clusters, and (ii) to study the reaction mechanism of CsPbBr3 NCs nucleation and growth in situ thanks to a combination of wide-angle X-ray Total Scattering (TS) or Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques and UV-visible spectroscopy. These methods will allow the different stages of the reactions to be monitored from the atomic to the nanometer length scales. With this fundamental study, the interaction between the ligand TOPO and the PbBr2 clusters forming at the early stages of the reaction will be unveiled","786":"Fe-carbides have been identified as the active phase in Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts. The presence of other phases than Fe-carbide, such as metallic Fe or Fe-oxide, lowers the FT activity and, especially Fe-oxides are problematic as they also catalyze the formation of CO2 from CO, implying loss of valuable C atoms. Moreover, the presence of other phases complicates the study of fundamental structure-performance relationships. Therefore, it is highly desirable to synthesize phase-pure Fe-carbide catalysts [2,3]. Here,we prepared phase-pure \u03c7-Fe5C2 by a dedicated carburization procedure of a high-purity Fe-oxide precursor obtained by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). The resulting phase-pure \u03c7-Fe5C2 catalyst outperforms reference catalysts with a high CTY and a very low selectivity to undesired CO2 and CH4  [2\u201311]. our goal is to determine in detail the evolution of the catalyst during carburization and the FT reaction employing operando WAXS combined with MS.","787":"This proposal focuses on the methanation of CO2 using H2 generated from water electrolysis, crucial for long-term energy storage from renewables. This highlights the importance of highly stable catalyst capable of resisting H2 dropouts. The aim is to investigate Ni@Al2O3 catalysts' activity and stability, emphasizing the influence of nanoparticle morphology and metal-support interaction. Preliminary In-situ PDF experiments at PETRA III reveal variations in Ni nanoparticle formation across different y-Al2O3 supports.  Additionally, the corresponding catalytic activity differs. Combined in-situ PDF and DRIFTS experiments, along with mass spectrometry, will help to analyze how different properties of  y-Al2O3 surfaces and disordered support structure influence catalyst activation and catalytic cycling, focusing on the support-metal interaction, surface chemistry and how different support materials impact  the behaviour and stability during industrially relevant dropout scenarios.","788":"This project will assess the adsorption capacity of CO2 and the selectivity of zeolites possessing OFF topology, focusing on the influence of framework flexibility and guest-molecules interactions with extra-framework cations (EFCs). Various OFF-type zeolites of differing dimensions will undergo testing to determine their CO2 adsorption capabilities when exposed to competing molecules such as N2 and CH4 across varying temperatures. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the relationship between CO2 adsorption and structural flexibility by elucidating the significance of host-guest interactions at the atomistic level.","789":"The development of colloidal nanocrystals as next-generation semiconductors relies heavily on understanding their structure with atomic-level precision, which is critical for interpreting and predicting the interaction between charge carriers and their lattice. In particular, halide perovskites are characterized by highly deformable octahedra frameworks, which makes conventional pictures based on phase diagrams inadequate to account for their structural subtleties; halide double perovskites with alternating octahedral units add one further layer of complexity. With the present proposal, we plan a combined XAS\/TS approach to characterize the structural response of halide perovskite nanocrystals in a wide temperature range relevant to optoelectronic applications and provide a comprehensive description of their local structure and dynamics across different length scales.","790":"We will use high resolution X-ray powder diffraction to structural subtleties in mixed-valent iron oxide chalcogenides and to correlate the structures with electronic and magnetic properties. We will use ID22 in a standard setup with 38 keV X-rays with powders of Sr3Fe4S2O6, Sr2CaFe4S2O6, Sr1.5Ca1.5Fe4S2O6 and Sr4Fe4S2O7. We will examine the structural subtleties (small distortions and incommensurability) and sample variation in Sr3Fe4S2O6 and the temperature evolution of all samples through low temperature magnetic ordering transitions. ID22 at the ESRF offers the optimal combination of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio to answer these questions.","791":"To reach the EU's carbon neutral goal by 2050, there is particular interest in developing porous solid adsorbents capable of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) at industry relevant conditions. Porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with hydrophobic pore environment are potential candidates to selective adsorb CO2 out of humid gas stream. However, the insights into the competitive adsorption process at molecular scale are rarely experimentally studied. We seek to request for 4 days at ID22 to carry out in situ adsorption experiment accompanied by high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) to study the CO2 capture in two hydrophobic zirconium-MOFs (MIL-140B and MIL-140C). The structure refinement on high-resolution PXRD enables the visualisation of the competitive binding process of CO2 and H2O within the porous framework. This proposal will provide insights into the mechanism of CO2 capture at realistic conditions and form proof of concept for future MOF design.","792":"We propose to study reactivity and stabilization of the high entropy oxide Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, by applying high instrumental and spatial resolution XRD to diffusion couples (DCs). Since Cu is deemed to be the destabilizing element in this system, we focus on the reaction between CuO and the quaternary oxide (Mg,Co,Ni,Zn)O. A SEM analysis showed the formation of a product layer (Cu2MgO3-like) and a defective, less crystalline, diffusion layer. A high resolution XRD test proved to be effective in monitoring the structure (phases, distortion, cell parameter) across the interface, while producing the same compositions in powder form led to inconclusive results. As we observed from SEM a different distribution of elements, and even phases, ranging from short (up to 30 minutes) to long reaction times, we propose to investigate insitu the reaction of the DC at 1000\u00b0C. In comparison, we plan to investigate the DCs obtained by interrupting the reaction after a selected duration.","793":"Our research draws inspiration from biogenic calcite's ability to incorporate biomacromolecules. Through ESRF experiments, we demonstrated the incorporation of amino acids (AAs) into various materials, including methylammonium lead bromide perovskites (MAPbBr3), widening their band gap and improving humidity stability critical for solar cells. Herein, we propose investigating for the first time water-free AA incorporation into MAPbBr3. Our focus is understanding how growth kinetics influence AA incorporation and their impact on crystal structure and optical properties. We'll grow MAPbBr3 crystals in non-water environments with 10 AAs, characterizing their structure via HR-PXRD on ID22. Additionally, we'll analyze the correlation between AA concentration and induced lattice distortions, linking them to changes in optical band gap. We believe this research will pave the way for bio-inspired enhancements in optoelectronic materials.","794":"We are looking to perform an extensive structural study on a new class of Fe(II) mononuclear complexes showing a first-order spin transition with unconventional large thermal hysteresis expanding around room temperature. We have previously demonstrated the possibility of a hysteresis loop modulation upon thermal-induced phase transition in this family of compounds, where a rearrangement of a flexible methoxy functional group occurs. In this work, much more rigid chemical functions R are appended in the ligand, so we expected that the origin of cooperativity its due to important structural distortions upon reversible conversion between both spin states, where the appearance of symmetry breaking can play a fundamental role. These new molecular platforms can be chemically modified in a simple way, and thereby subtly modulate their SCO behaviour and thus their barocaloric properties, which is essential for future applications in eco-friendly technologies.","795":"Layered oxides (LiMeO2, Me = Co, Ni, Mn) with the space group R-3m are state-of-the-art cathode materials in Li ion batteries. In these materials, Ni2+ is the redox-active centre, and the amount of Ni2+ limits the capacity. The amount, in turn, is a maximum of 1\/3 of the Me 3a sites in the Me-O host structures. LiNiO2 is, with 33%, the material with the highest Ni2+ content. This work aims to unravel the origin of the Ni2+ content- and, thus the capacity-limitation of layered oxides. ","796":"Pt electrocatalysts are widely used as cathode material in polymer-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) as they combine high ORR activity with sufficient stability. However, their long-term stability is still limited because of irreversible changes in the Pt surface morphology caused by electrochemical oxidation\/reduction cycles (ORC). To increase their longevity it is mandatory to understand the involved degradation processes on an atomic scale. First experiments on the (1x2) missing row reconstructed Pt(110) surface hint towards an intermittent formation of an ordered 2D surface oxide, which would be substantially different to the suface oxide phases on Pt(111) and Pt(100). With the here proposed experiments we aim to eludicate the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the Pt(110)-(1x2) interface structure during ORCs using operando high energy X-ray surface diffraction. The aquired data will help to interpret the differences found in the Pt dissolution and restructuring behaviour.","797":"This proposal aims to study the local structural rearrangements that occur in O2-type lithium-rich layered manganese oxide during the first cycle of lithium electrochemical (de)intercalation. The O2-LiMn0.75O2 phase will be used as the positive electrode material in lithium-metal batteries. Total X-ray scattering intensities will be collected at the ID31 beamline from the O2-LiMn0.75O2 materials operando during the first charge and the discharge of the batteries. Pair distribution functions (PDFs) will then be calculated, which will allow the changes in the first oxygen-oxygen distances during cycling to be precisely monitored. This would help us to identify the nature of the oxidized species of oxygen (oxidized oxide ions O-, peroxo-like ions O22- or trapped O2 gas molecules) during the first charge. ","798":"Copper electrocatalysts are unique in catalysing the formation of carbon-carbon bonds, an essential first step for producing C2+ products during electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Intermittent oxidation of Cu nanocatalysts further enhances the selectivity towards C2+ products, especially ethanol, but the mechanistic understanding is limited. We developed a method for producing Cu epitaxial thin films, which provide a versatile alternative for bulk single crystals, especially under strongly restructuring conditions such as the pulsed CO2RR. Here, we will use HE-SXRD to study the structural dynamics of both the surface as well as the bulk of such films under CO2RR conditions. From these experiments, we expect to track the transition from changes in the surface structure to the formation of bulk Cu2O. The results of these experiments enable us to optimize the design\/operating conditions of Cu CO2RR electrocatalysts based on a mechanistic understanding rather than empirical evidence.","799":"The efficiency of green hydrogen production is hindered by the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and efficient catalysts like NiF-layered double hydroxide (LDH) are needed. This study aims to elucidate the structure of NiF-LDH during OER in operando, in electrolytes containing various alkali cations using X-ray scattering techniques. Initially, the active structure of the catalyst in single alkali cation electrolytes (LiOH, NaOH, CsOH) will be investigated, followed by electrolytes containing mixed cations (e.g., NaOH with LiOH). Through operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pair distribution function analysis (PDF), the study aims to determine whether increased intercalation of cations and water leads to an expansion of the interlayer distance or other structural changes within the catalyst layers. This dynamic characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms guiding electrolyte-electrode optimization.","800":"The interface structure of Pt electrodes in aqueous solution \u2013 a key model system in electrochemistry \u2013 has attracted great current interest. Recent electrochemical measurements and theoretical studies suggest a crucial role of adsorbed water layers within the electrochemical double layer, but propose different models. The true interface structure is currently not resolved due to lack of experimental data on the microscopic arrangement of the interfacial water. We here propose to obtain such data by in situ high energy surface X-ray diffraction (HESXRD) studies, which allow to reliably determine the small scattering contribution of water adlayers. We will employ this method for systematic clarification of the influence of electrode potential and chemisorbed H and OH layers on the water structure near Pt(111) and Pt(100) electrodes.","801":"Valence tautomerism is a stimulated intramolecular electron transfer which allows for switching between two distinct redox isomers. Such compounds,\r\nincorporating a redox-active ligand and a redox-active metal, allow for the realisation of switchable optical and magnetic materials. The first lanthanide containing\r\ncoordination polymer to exhibit this behaviour, SmI2(pyz)3, exhibits an abrupt, hysteretic transition between {Sm(II)-pyz} and {Sm(III)-pyz.-} tautomers. Alloying with other halides allows for tuning of the valence tautomeric \"switching\" temperature. Herein, we will utilise XANES and XMCD at the L2,3 edges of Sm alongside Sm-149 M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy to probe the Sm valency and electronic configuration of the various tautomers formed after temperature change and light irradiation. ","802":"Over the past decade, interest in circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) has grown rapidly. CPL-active materials have huge potential for applications in biological science, optoelectronics and information storage. In the vast majority of published research, luminescence (achiral or circularly polarised) is excited using light in the same energy range as the emission (UV-Vis-NIR). Synchrotron X-ray radiation can homogeneously excite the sample and lead to optical luminescence (X-ray excited optical luminescence - XEOL). This technique increases the quantum yield of optical luminescence and therefore allows the analysis of very weak transitions in molecules. However, CP-XEOL is not yet a widely used technique and remains vastly unexplored. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the CP-XEOL phenomenon in molecular materials based on lanthanide ions and helicenes in order to expand the database of CP-XEOL measurements and to study in depth the CPL spectra of these particular compounds.","803":"Hydrogen bond interactions are pivotal in the pharmaceutical industry, influencing drug-target binding, solubility, and formulation. Crystal engineering optimizes drugs using these bonds, with sulfonamides historically crucial in antimicrobial applications. High-pressure studies on sulfamide have revealed structural phase transitions due to modifications in the hydrogen-bond interactions. The transition affects the electronic density of sulfur atoms, making sulfamide the ideal compound to study changes in hydrogen bond interactions by an element-specific technique (i.e., XAS). Among all the beamlines, ID12 emerges as the best choice for studying this compound, as it is the only beamline where measurements of XAS at high pressures are routinely performed in the required X-ray energy range. If successful, these experiments could be potentially extended to other drugs and atoms beyond sulfonamides and sulfur, allowing the design and development of improved therapeutic agents. ","804":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the pressure-induced modification of crystal lattice and electronic structure of two-dimensional V2CTz MXenes (Tz are = O and -Cl surface groups) by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Depending on the chemical etching environment, the exfoliated 2D MXene layers possess different surface functional groups and interlayer spacing defining their band structure and electronic properties. The fundamental question is how the surface functional groups and chemical bonding affect the band structure of 2D MXenes. Since pressure allows to change the interlayer distance, the van der Waals interaction and the electronic states, we propose to perform pressure-induced XANES studies at the K edges of transition metal and surface groups of functionalized V2CTz MXene single crystal in the 1-20 GPa. In such ground-breaking experiments, we expect a significant impact on the MXenes\u2019 electronic structure under applying pressure. ","805":"This proposal aims at studying the effect of single-ion magnetic anisotropy on X-ray magnetochiral dichroism (XM\u03c7D). The effect is closely related to the linear magneto-electric effect and described by orbital and spin toroidal current (anapole moments) in the absorbing atom that has no inversion symmetry. XM\u03c7D was successfully detected and studied not only at the K-edges of transition metal complexes[1] but also at the L3-edge of Holmium in chiral paramagnetic crystals of Na5[Ho(ODA)3](BF4)2\u00b76H2O.[2] Its isostructural Dysprosium analogue, hereafter referred to as Dy(ODA)3, exhibits a very unusual magnetic property, namely a switching of the magnetic anisotropy from easy-axis to easy-plane, induced by temperature or applied magnetic field. This is why this chiral paramagnetic crystal was selected to investigate the effect of magnetic anisotropy on XM\u03c7D response at the L2,3-edges of Dysprosium. ","806":"NH3 is one of the most important chemical products and is responsible for fertilizer production. NH3 synthesis from N2 is the current commercial process but suffers from the high activation barrier of N2, requiring 400-500 C and 150-300 bar operation conditions. Towards low temperature and pressure NH3 synthesis, we have developed LaN-based catalysts, in which the N vacancy (VN) activates N2 whereas metal particles split H2. Our previous energy dispersive RIXS at the N K edge discovered the surface N2 species via its vibrational modes. Here we will monitor the activation of the N2 among different LaN-supported catalysts by determining precise energy spacing between those vibrational modes. So far there is no method to directly probe the N2 activation process and we are the first. The success of this proposal will 1) provide insight into how N2 is activated at VN; and 2) establish a general method to probe surface N2 in NH3 synthesis.","807":"Ni is a promising co-catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting but it suffers from activity decay. We will use time-resolved operando XAS  to investigate the deactivation mechanism of a model system based on dewetted Ni nanoparticles on SrTiO 3 single crystals. Results will enable rational design of photocatalysts based, e.g., on faceted metal oxide particles where HER and OER co-catalysts are site-selectively decorated on electron- and hole-collecting facets, respectively.","808":"The objective of this proposal is to use in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate Cu-Pd tandem electrocatalysts designed for the selective conversion of CO2 into C2+ products. These electrocatalysts consist of mesoporous oxygen-rich copper inverse opals (mCu) synthesized via a colloid templating method whose surface is uniformly decorated with Pd nanoclusters via Cluster Beam Deposition (CBD). We will conduct in situ measurements of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at both Cu and Pd K-edges using a specially designed grazing incidence electrochemical flow cell. This will allow us to explore the dynamic electronic and structural properties of the electrocatalysts during electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) conditions as a function of Pd loading to enhance our understanding of the structure-activity relationship governing highly active Pd-Cu tandem CO2 electrocatalysts, in their selectivity of C2+ products.","809":"The goal of this proposal is to use X-ray excited Optical Luminescence (XEOL)-detected X-ray absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) to investigate the electronic and structural properties of a series of novel selenium-based hackmanite materials displaying remarkable photoluminescent (including long-persistent luminescence) and photochromic properties, as a function of the selenium content and halogen (Cl-, Br-, I-) coordination.  XEOL-XAFS recorded simultaneously with conventional transmission XAFS will provide enhanced selectivity facilitating and discriminating the structure determination between the luminescent and photochromic species. This investigation will provide a better understanding of the selenium species structure-to-luminescence\/photochromism relationship focusing on Se interaction with the different halogen anions present in their environment and with the template framework and contribute to rationalize the design of new phosphors for LED and photodetector applications. \r\n","810":"In previous experiments, the method to refine the anomalous dispersion correctional terms used in small-molecule single-crystal XRD has been established. In this experiment we want to test the ability of the anomalous dispersion refinements (ADR) to quantify the occupancies of mixed positions. This approach would generate an entirely different method to obtain precise stoichiometry in difficult cases by using the anomalous signal of an element residing at a mixed position. ","811":"Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) contain active metal species as isolated single atoms stabilized by suitable supports, and they have become popular due to their excellent activity, selectivity and applicability in many processes, including selective coupling reactions. Despite recent developments, SACs action mechanism is poorly understood, but investigating the interplay between electronic properties and local structure of SACs active sites during catalysis is essential to enhance their performance. The proposed operando XAS measurements will exploit the liquid-phase C-C coupling of iodobenzene to biphenyl as a model reaction to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to changes in oxidation state and coordinative environment in SACs. These results will provide insights into the reaction conditions favoring the aggregation of carbon nitride-supported Pd single atoms and contribute to the development of mechanistic models predicting SACs behavior in C-C coupling conditions.","812":"Cu-CHA zeolite is the state-of-the-art commercial catalysts for NH3-SCR, showing excellent low temperature activity and selectivity coupled to good hydrothermal stability, but it suffers from SO2 poisoning. Starting from the knowledge acquired on this catalyst, we aim to study Cu\/LTA zeolites, which have been shown to have even better hydrothermal stability. High Si\/Al ratio Cu\/LTA, fresh and aged at high temperature (750 and 900 \u00b0C), will be characterized by operando XAS during thermal activation (including wet conditions for the fresh ones), followed by exposure to NH3-SCR reactants, to get information on Cu speciation in different temperature and reactants conditions, NH3-SCR reaction mechanism and effect of SO2 poisoning","813":"We aim to identify the relevant species correlated to high methane-to-methyl-ester conversion activity in Mn\/TiO2 catalysts and monitor the behavior and changes in Mn speciation\/structure of these materials during reaction using time-resolved XAS. In particular, the influence of the protectant co-feed (used to prevent product overoxidation) on the speciation and structure of active Mn species will be measured in order to understand how this protectant may also modify the catalyst to produce enhanced methane conversion activity than what is achieved in the absence of the protectant co-feed. Using a highly improved reaction concept developed in the group combined with the advanced Quick XAS capabilities, we aim to complete the first in situ spectroscopy experiments for methane-to-ester chemistry, providing previously unattainable insights into one of the most selective methane partial oxidation pathways. ","814":"This project aims to understand how Fe2O3-CoPi photoelectrodes work for photoelectrochemical water splitting. There are three different models about how cobalt in these electrodes contributes to the reaction, in particular, hole accumulation, participation forming Co(IV) intermediates at the cobalt oxyhydroxide surface and\/or additional absorption of light with subsequent shifting of the electronic density from Co to oxygen radical. By measuring small differences in Co and Fe K-edge XAS spectra induced by light modulation in situ at photoelectrochemical conditions we would like to disentangle these mechanisms and find the dominant one. This will help improve the design of these photoelectrodes and find directions for more efficient hydrogen fuel production.","815":"The aim of the project is to investigate the local structural evolution of photoluminescent inorganic materials, i.e. Eu3+-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO4), during high temperature annealing. We are focused on unravelling to which extent different synthetic approaches, i.e. inverse miniemulsion (wet-chemistry) and ball milling (solid state-chemistry), affect the local structure of inorganic materials in particular during the annealing. We aim to evaluate the dopant-induced variations on the structure (electronic, short- and long-range) through a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (at Eu L3-edge and Mo K-edge) and X-ray diffraction in situ measurements while annealing at 900 \u00b0C, both in He and in air. With these findings we aim to thoroughly understand the reversible structural and electronic changes occurring during the annealing process, which are found to strongly affect the photoluminescent (Eu2+-Eu3+) properties, to a different extent depending on the synthetic route.","816":"In order to optimize the content of the expensive noble metal (NM) and retain high stability and low-temperature activity of catalysts, this study aims at studying structure-activity relationships in Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts for CH4 oxidation. This will be achieved by exploiting the strong metal-support interaction in this system and the ability to tune the noble metal speciation (particle size, oxidation state) by systematically applying various oxidative (O2) and reductive (CO, CH4) treatments. By means of in situ XAS and XRD measurements, the goal of the present study is to reveal structural changes of Pd, i.e. oxidation state and particle size (XAS), and CeO2-ZrO2 support, i.e. reduction of the mixed oxide (XRD, supported by XAS), that are caused during various reducing treatments. Next, the activity and stability of the samples will be monitored during successive light-off\/light-out cycles and correlated with simultaneous operando XAS and XRD data on Pd and CeO2-ZrO2 supports.","817":"Non-ionic hydrophobic eutectic solvents (DES) emerged as promising substitutes for the conventional apolar phase in solvent extraction (SX) due to their enhance extractant solubility, elimination of volatile diluents, suppression of third phase formation, and incorporation of bio-compatible compound as phase formers. However, the non-ideality of the DES liquid phase makes it difficult to accurately model and predict metal partition whilst metal speciation post-SX is poorly characterized. The lack of structural characterisation hinders the wider applicability of these promising solvents and precludes their rational design for a given separation. The aim of this proposal is to get structural information on the structure of three different extracted lanthanide complexes (La, Eu, Yb) as a function of the DES nature, metal concentration and DES composition by XAS. This study will be complementary to ongoing SAXS, calorimetry, and Molecular Dynamics simulations studies.","818":"The combination in one catalytic system of the aqueous phase reforming (APR) reaction of small alcohols to generate in-situ the H2 necessary to the hydrogenolysis (APH) of glycerol is a promising process to produce 1,2- and 1,3-propanediols, which are fundamental for the sustainable manufacture of plastics, drugs, etc. We investigated this process using a series Ni-Cu bimetallic catalysts supported on Mg-Al oxides. The results indicate that the combination of the two metals is vitalto achieve high propanediol selectivity but do not ensure stability. While some insights on this latter issue are available, to date, the precise role of the two metals as well as that of the Mg support in performing APR and APH in a single catalytic system are not clear. Scope of this proposal is to unravel the evolution of the catalytic system under operando conditions, in order to provide a rational on the exceptionally high selectivity of Cu-Ni catalysts while understanding the deactivation mechanism.

Such bimetallic catalysts are typically used for emission reduction in the exhaust of heat and power plants but the fundamental understanding of their evolution under reaction conditions is still lacking. This is caused partially by the rather heterogeneous catalyst structure obtained by conventional preparation methods. Starting with well-defined and alloyed Pt-Pd NPs of different sizes, the evolution of each noble metal will be monitored by in situ\/operando XAS at Pt L3 and Pd K edges and XRD measurements while exposing the catalysts to progressively higher temperatures. This will help to identify segregation and de-alloying processes as well as the formation of highly dispersed Pt and Pd species, which lead to catalyst deactivation. In a next step, the re-alloying process will be investigated as a function of catalyst reactivation conditions.

By means of this strategy, we expect to answer whether and if the support is a spectator and, if not, how Sr and Ti are involved in catalysis. The combined XAS and XRD shall allow us to precisely follow the evolution of the oxidation state and any change in the local coordination and electron density of the element(s) as well as the formation, if any, of lattice defects (which and where).

By varying manganese concentrations, the study aims to understand the catalyst's active structure under realistic electrolysis conditions. Operando X-ray diffraction and total scattering will determine how manganese affects the interlayer distance and structural changes within the catalyst layers. Simultaneous X-ray absorption spectroscopy will track the oxidation states of Mn and Ni. This research contributes to developing new OER catalysts, crucial for green hydrogen production, with Ni-based hydroxides. The study employs a newly developed operando gas diffusion electrode (GDE) cell for realistic electrolysis condition, which allows measuring combines XAS and XRD\/PDF.","822":"Structural dynamic in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has a dramatic impact on their CO2 adsorption properties. An understudied approach to induce this dynamic behavior is represented by the modulation of the metal composition of the metallic nodes. We recently discovered that the structural flexibility of a known MOF strictly depends on its metal composition, affecting and improving its CO2 uptake performances. We indeed propose to perform a combined in situ XAS\/HR-PXRD+PDF experiment to deeply elucidate the short- and long-range structural rearrangement mechanisms and the host-guest interactions of such systems during CO2 adsorption. The results will highlight the direct influence of the nature and relative composition of the metal nodes on the structural dynamics of the framework and on its adsorption capability. We believe that the instrumental setup of BM31 is extremely suitable for performing such a study, and the results will be unprecedented in the field of CO2 adsorbents.","823":"Magnesium carbides Mg2C3 and Mg2C are high pressure compounds that can be obtained from the mixtures of elements at HPHT conditions using large-volume multianvil apparatuses.

The goal of this project is to perform such in situ HPHT decomposition controlled by heating velocity that allows obtaining nanoparticles of carbon at the initial stages of carbide decomposition, per se or in presence of disordered BN forms. Proposed Mg-C(-BN) nanocomposites are of interest for improving mechanical properties of the Magnesium with C, as well as the binding of C nanoparticles with Mg. The extremes of hardness and fracture toughness for both types of light strong alloys, as well as improved chemical stability (e.g. melting of C-rich Mg instead of burning) are expected.","824":"Double-core carbon nanothreads are a new one-dimensional nanomaterial with promising properties consisting of fully saturated carbons.

Here we propose to study the synthesis of double core nanothreads following the high-pressure crystal structures up to reaction threshold using selected pseudo-stilbene precursors: 4-aminoazobenzene and a mixed crystal of bibenzyl-stilbene. The first one is designed to promote the topochemical pathway, exploiting its electronic properties, thus lowering the pressure reaction threshold and optimizing the product\u2019s yield. The mixed crystal will permit the modulation of the chromophore concentration within the threads, opening the way to the arbitrary tuning of the chemical and physical properties of the resulting nanothread.","825":"The aim of the proposed experiment is to synthesize binary nitrides and polynitrides of U, Th and Tc. This research will contribute to our fundamental\r\n understanding of actinide chemistry and their fission products, expanding our knowledge of element behavior under extreme conditions.

Furthermore, the synthesis of new binary actinide nitrides will give insights into the stability and properties of these compounds, leading to the discovery of novel materials with enhanced characteristics","826":"The development of high-energy and low-cost cathode materials is one of the most pressing issues in solid-state and Li\u2013ion battery research. Transition metal fluoride conversion-type cathodes, such as CuF2, are an attractive alternative to state-of-the-art intercalation cathodes in this context, offering a three- to five-fold higher theoretical capacity at lower cost and in the absence of scarce metals. Lithium diffusivity and electrolyte instability concerns, as well as a limited knowledge of the growing cathode solid electrolyte interphase (CEI), have so far prevented their more practical pursuit. Here, using ex-situ Ptychographic and XRF Nanotomography, we would like to investigate a nanostructured CuF2 composite cathode, utilized in a solid-state battery (SSB). Tomograms provide a 3D model of the cathode layer spatial arrangement, component connectivity, their evolution, alongside a first insight into the local CEI composition and how it determines battery performance.","827":"Anodic porous transport layer (PTL) is a critical component for water\/gas transportation to\/from the anode catalyst layer and an important interface for electron\/proton transfer in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer cell. The common material used for PTL structure is Ti, which is highly prone to passivation in long-term application and can be degraded faster if it is not protected with a Pt coating. In order to deposit PTL with Pt, an etching procedure is required to remove formed TiO2 layer, resulting in huge morphological changes in this layer. The proposed study aims to investigate the morphological changes (porosity and PTL\/catalyst interface) due to various etching conditions using X-ray tomography and correlates its influences with the electrolyzer performance. ","828":"The goal of the present project is to get the atomic\/electronic description of the electrochemical interface for the archetypal system Pt(111) as a function of the pH and the concentration of the perchlorate solution. Indeed, an unexplained capacitive behaviour has been observed by several authors, but never explained, due to the lack of experimental probes of the interfacial charges.  \r\nBeyond this system, the expected results will allow to improve the ab initio theoretical description of the SRXRD spectra and make more and more realiable our new approach coupling SRXRD and ab initio simulation. This will be a major contribution to the up to now lacking experimental evidence of the electrochemical interface charge distribution.\r\n","829":"Photoinduced phase transitions have open a wide field of investigation for functional materials, where a single laser shot can drive a macroscopic phase transition, which may persist at room temperature. Usually, thermal phase transition on warming or photoinduced phase transition processes occur from a low symmetry towards a higher symmetry phase, due to entropy consideration. We have recently shown that coupled changes of electronic state and symmetry at thermal equilibrium allows for the appearance of high temperature low symmetry phases, which we observed in a spin-crossover material. We propose to study by time-resolved x-ray diffraction the dynamics beyond photoinduced change of spin state and symmetry breaking, for understanding how the photoinduced change of spin state drives symmetry-breaking. Photoinduced symmetry breaking represents a fascinating perspective, as many functions are related to ordering phenomena, such as ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity of ferroelasticity.","830":"We propose an ESRF beamtime to study pH-driven DNA structural transitions using time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TRXSS). Our focus is on the structural pathways from Watson-Crick (WC) double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to non-canonical i-motif and G-quadruplex (G-quad) structures. These non-canonical DNA structures play vital roles in biology such as regulation of gene expression and telomere maintenance. While their thermodynamics are understood, their kinetics, especially in competition with WC dsDNA, are less explored. We plan to use a visible-light-sensitive photoacid to induce pH changes with a nanosecond laser and monitor dsDNA dissociation and i-motif and G-quad formation kinetics with TRXSS. Complementary Molecular Dynamics simulations will use the TRXSS results to examine the structural trajectory along the kinetic pathways. Our study aims to unveil potential intermediates involved in dsDNA dissociation and provide insights into nucleic acid structural transitions.","831":"In a previous ID10 experiment, a novel setup, coupling GISAXS with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was successfully tested. The simultaneous use of these two in situ techniques provides an unprecedented view on the early stages of surface induced nucleation, with the ability to probe nuclei size, shape and spatial organization (GISAXS), as well as their elastic properties and mass (QCM), and the evolution of all these parameters over time. Here, we aim to use this technique to study the universality of the amorphous precursor nucleation pathway when nucleation takes place at an interface. The aim of this new experiment is (1) to acquire QCM and GISAXS data for systems for which we know (from ex situ external characterization) that nucleation at interfaces proceeds via amorphous intermediates (CaCO3 on quartz and mica), and (2) to evaluate the universality of this pathway for other substrates.","832":"The nature and catalytic role of zinc in Cu\/ZnO-based CO2-to-methanol catalysts have long been subject of debate. Specifically, it is speculated whether tetrahedral [ZnO4] or octahedral [ZnO6] constitutes the active sites, and how the degree of reduction of Zn at the ZnOx-Cu interface affects the activity. In both cases, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used for in situ and operando catalyst characterization, but differentiation of the Zn species is limited. \r\nOur aim is to perform 1s2p-RIXS, measured at the off-diagonal of the Zn K\u03b11,2 emission lines, which contains well-distinguishable spectral fingerprints of metallic phases, as well as tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Zn. The proposed beamtime is expected to give qualitative and quantitative analysis of the Zn species in a model catalyst under reaction conditions.\r\n","833":"This proposal aims to unravel the structure-activity relationships of catalytic Ru species during the selective hydrogenation and upcycling of end-of-life poly(butadiene) (PBD), an environmentally crucial recycling process. Intuitive optimization allowed us to obtain a homogeneous system yielding promising hydrogenation selectivities with adequate catalyst stability. The overall selectivity is mainly influenced by the applied hydrogen pressure and local environment of the Ru catalyst. However, no clear proof has been found yet of the exact nature of the active catalyst and as to why certain catalytic precursors clearly outperform others. To date, very little is known on the exact speciation and coordination environment of these in situ formed Ru catalysts. The main scientific questions that should thus be answered are: (i) what is the nature of the Ru catalyst?; (ii) which Ru species are active?; and (iii) what is the overall reaction mechanism to explain the selective hydrogenation?","834":"Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts are widely used materials for key reactions in industry like selective hydrogenations. Because of their complexity, synchrotron techniques are often used to study the active metal phase. Recent development in computational chemistry allowed for the calculation of XAS and XES spectra that can describe and possibly predict key structural and functional properties. In this context, the present study aims at acquiring top-level HERFD-XAS and resonant XES data on several Pt-based materials and create a solid experimental\/simulated benchmark for spectroscopic properties involving them. A particular emphasis will be put on the size-dependency of these properties by studying a range of materials from bulk Pt to single-atom catalysts.","835":"This proposal aims to shed light on the Pd-catalyzed reaction of novel conjugated dienes with CO2. Recently, several new dienes were synthesized in our group, widening the potential scope of this reaction. The synthesis of cyclic monoesters with these dienes would provide a wide variety of building blocks for polyesters with high CO2 fixation capacity. To achieve high product yields for different types of dienes, more insights in (i) the catalytic cycle, (ii) structure-activity relationships and (iii) the main deactivation routes are required. These aspects have not yet been properly investigated using relevant characterization techniques (e.g. XAS, NMR, IR) due to the challenging reactions conditions, such as high CO2 pressure. The proposed experiment aims to fill this gap, focusing on the characterization of the Pd catalysts under industrially relevant temperature and CO2 pressure, employing an ad hoc designed high-pressure catalytic cell.  ","836":"The structural integrity of {CexZr6-xO4(OH)4} clusters (x = 6, 1) deposited inside the pores or being integral part of the metal-organic framework (MOF) upon interaction with nonthermal plasma (NTP) will be determined. Ce K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) will be employed to study the impact of Ar, H2\/N2 and H2\/CO2 plasma in situ. The overall goal is to correlate plasma conditions with MOF and cluster stability, cerium oxide formation and the redox chemistry of cerium. ","837":"Among many Earth-abundant catalysts, Co3O4 spinels have shown great OER activity. However, the precise mechanism through which water is oxidized, and crucially, its connection to the evolution of the active site, has remained unclear. Recent results from time-resolved ATR-FTIR photolysis experiments, have suggested the presence of two mechanistic cycles that achieve O-O bond formation: a fast one occurring on electronically coupled Co(IV)=O sites, and a slow one where the Co(IV) center is isolated. Nevertheless, no direct observation of the putative Co(IV), or the Co(II\/III)-OOH species has been made under operando conditions to date. Time-resolved Co K-edge XAS with the fast monochromator of ID24 will provide crucial oxidation and spin state information of the cobalt ions (XANES) as well as coordination environment information (EXAFS) in the few seconds range after an electrochemical potential bias is applied to a well-defined Co3O4 precatalyst.\r\n","838":"It is planned to investigate NiFe - layered double hydroxide during electrochemical OER conditions. By application of in-situ X-Ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy we hope to elucidate the electronic state and structure (XANES) of the catalyst material. EXAFS will be used to compare inter-atomic distances thus giving insight into the local structure of the catalyst. Fe K-edges will be of special interest to investigate the appearance of Fe(IV) species that have been calculated to be present during OER related potentials but have been difficult to detect in previous XAS experiments. A fact that we attribute to the inability to combine high potential and current density experiments with in-situ XAS measurements. We designed a novel in-situ XAS cell for this study, which we will use to obtain industrially relevant current densities and investigate the catalyst under high anodic potentials thus bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrially relevant electrolysis technologies.","839":"Water scarcity is one of the key contemporary environmental issues. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as unique materials for atmospheric water harvesting even at very low relative humidity levels, with facile uptake and release kinetics. In order to rationally design improved water harvesting MOFs it is however critical to reach a detailed mechanistic, structural, and electronic understanding of the dynamic adsorption-desorption process. Here, we propose a combined in situ hard XAS\/XES study to investigate the local structural and electronic modifications that occur during water adsorption and desorption in MOF systems appended with azopyridine molecules that undergo photochemically induced cis\/trans transitions, which regulate the water uptake and release. We expect our results to unveil the stages of water capture by selected MOFs with unprecedented detail, thereby paving the way for the rational design of improved MOF water harvesting systems.","840":"The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) holds promise for converting carbon emissions and renewable energy into valuable chemicals. Cu-based catalysts offer an alternative to Fischer-Tropsch processes, but research to date has mainly focused on nanostructured Cu particles, neglecting active sites at smaller scales like single-atom and dimers. We recently developed a new molecular binuclear Cu phenanthroline complex catalyst for eCO2RR, and its performance outperforms typical metallic Cu surfaces. Although our post-mortem characterization did not trace the phase evolution, suggesting considerable stability, the active sites may undergo reversible alterations (to particles) under potentials. To address this, we propose in situ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy to track the oxidation and coordination state evolution of the binuclear Cu site under eCO2RR condition, correlating with the product spectrum to map the in-reaction dynamic structure-reactivity relation.","841":"Copper-based catalysts play a crucial role in many catalytic reactions ranging from biological electron-transfer process to electrosynthesis of chemicals. A prominent example is the utilization of Cu single atoms coordinated with nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu-N-C) materials in electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3-RR). Investigating the potential-dependent dynamic evolution of electronic structure of Cu center is paramount for a comprehensive understanding of its adsorption behaviour and unveiling the fundamental multiple electron-transfer processes. Herein, we propose performing in-situ HERFD-XAS characterization of Cu-N-C model catalyst for eNO3-RR. Through interpreting the evolution of pre-edge and rising edge features in HERFD-XANES spectra, we aim to address two fundamental questions: 1. How does the geometric configuration and oxidation state of Cu center evolve under varying potentials? 2. What is the impact of adsorbates at different stages, with and without NO3-?","842":"Current industry standards rely on a multi-step energy intensive process to convert methane into methanol, while soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) enzymes are capable of converting methane to methanol under aerobic conditions and ambient pressures and temperatures. The structure of the methane activating intermediate sMMO-Q has been intensely debated as being an open or closed \u2018diamond\u2019 core for decades. Efforts to understand the catalytic cycle of sMMO have led to an abundance of molecular mimics, including work on a complex capable of performing temperature dependent reversible O-O bond scission by Kodera et. al, which features a high spin diiron(IV) state. In light of recent work by our research group, such temperature dependent behavior is uniquely poised to help understand the structure of sMMO-Q.

Our findings will provide guidance in future materials design and optimization for higher-energy Na-ion batteries.","844":"With the increase in CO2 emission, the conversion and utilization of CO2 have emerged as a research frontier. Herein, we prepared a series of Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts by exploiting the activation ability of Pd for hydrogen, which significantly improved the CO2 conversion with H2 at low temperatures. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the interfacial structures formed between Pd-Cu species and oxygen vacancies (VO) on the CeO2 surface, which can determine the activation of CO2, H2 and the formation of intermediate species. Here, we apply for an in situ Pd L3 edge, Ce L3 edge and Cu K edge valence-to-core (Vtc)- RIXS study to follow the dynamics of the Pd-Cu d band with the evolution of the Ce4f-O2p bond structure of CeO2 and identify surface reactant adsorption under RWGS reaction conditions.

In the industrial catalyst, FMO is typically prepared with an excess of molybdenum to enable good stability. The same kind of materials can be employed for ODH of ethanol with high selectivity and conversion to acetaldehyde, which is rarely studied yet. However, the exact role of Fe in the redox chemistry of the reactions is not clear. By in situ synchrotron based M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy (SMS) we would like to probe how Fe is involved in the above-mentioned ODH reactions, using a capillary quartz tube oven reactor that has been used at SMS of ESRF previously.

Understanding structure-property relations of H2CO3 is of significant interest not only to astrophysics, as H2CO3 is likely to be present on the surface and in the interiors of icy moons (e.g. Ganymede) or ice giants (e.g. Uranus), but also to solid state chemistry, as it is a molecular compound which has led to a number of mutually contradictory studies, e.g. regarding an assumed polymorphism. Up to now no single crystal diffraction data of H2CO3 has been reported and its structure even at low pressures (< 10 GPa) is in dispute. In preliminary experiments, we synthesized H2CO3 crystals from a H2O + CO2 mixture and characterised the product by Raman spectroscopy.

However, metal chalcogenides have been largely overlooked as KIB cathodes due to the prevalence of side reactions during the intercalation process. Our recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of reversible K+ ion intercalation into CrSe2, achieving near-theoretical capacity in the resulting battery. This marks a significant advancement in the application of chalcogenides in KIB research. While the results are promising, challenges remain, including enhancing cycling stability and understanding structural changes during potassium intercalation.

Spectra collected at the Ni and Fe edges will allow for identification of structural transformation and the actual active structure and species under HER, OER and UOR conditions, shedding light on the structure-activity relationship of NiFeSP and the promotion mechanism of P and S incorporation.","868":"This proposal focuses on studying transition metal-supported catalysts for methane pyrolysis into high-purity hydrogen and carbon nanotubes. Methane conversion and carbon product types depend heavily on the catalyst properties, but their precise relationship remains unclear. Fe-based catalysts are seen as robust, eco-friendly, and abundant, while the addition of Mo as a promoter boosts catalyst stability and provides extra carbon nucleation sites. The work aims to use in situ\/operando XAFS\/XRD to examine the Fe and Mo species formed during methane pyrolysis and subsequent regeneration, and their link to methane activation and selectivity toward carbon nanotubes. The findings will support the design of improved catalysts for continuous hydrogen and carbon nanotube production, which holds significant industrial potential.","869":"The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach for the conversion of nitrate contaminants into ammonia (NH3), a desirable chemical nowadays produced with the energy-intensive Haber Bosch process. Cu remains one of the most effective catalysts for NO3RR, however, its NH3 selectivity and production rate are still limited. The fundamental reactivity\/structure\/composition relationships need further elucidation to move the field forward. Herein, we study the impact of size, shape and composition of Cu catalysts in NO3RR using a library of well-defined and shaped tunable Cu and Cu oxide nanocrystals. These catalysts exhibit different performance, which needs to be explained considering their status during operation. This proposal aims at using operando X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to follow dynamic changes in coordination environment and oxidation state of Cu under NO3RR","870":"Thermoelectric (TE) materials, which allow the conversion of heat into electricity, are promising candidates for sustainable energy conversion technologies. Layered compounds such as non-stoichiometric ZrSey (y\u22482) appear as a potential TE material. This proposal aims (i) to better characterize the controversial real structure at different length scales of as grown ZrSey (y\u22482) synthesized with different nominal selenium content and (ii) to study the impact of the densification process (Spark Plasma Sintering) prior to measuring the TE properties on those multi-scale structural properties. High energy powder X-ray diffraction data coupled to PDF analysis and XAS data will allow to clarify the multi-scale structure, true stoichiometry and zirconium oxidation state of three representative ZrSe2-d as grown (dnominal\u22450.14, 0.10, 0.06) and SPS-processed samples. Our ultimate goal is to improve the understanding of the structure-TE properties relationship in ZrSe2-d.","871":"Fe-based catalysts are active catalysts for the catalytic decomposition of methane, key-reaction for the energy transition, which leads to pure H2 and solid C. Despite the interest, a full comprehension of the structure-activity relationship for Fe-based catalysts is still under way. In our group we focused on experimental and modelling activity on CH4 pyrolysis over Fe\/Al2O3 catalysts. To rationalize the results in terms of Fe active site\/phase, with this proposal we aim at systematically investigate catalyst modifications during activation and pyrolysis reaction by operando powder X-ray diffraction combined with operando XAS on a series of samples, varying the Fe loading (12 - 100 wt% Fe, with Al2O3 as textural promoter). We will focus on high-quality PXRD and XAS data collection in reaction conditions, to determine the metal active phase structure and the role played by metastable and intermediate phases, as well as the changes in Fe oxidation state and average coordination numbers.","872":"The aim of this proposal is the investigation as a function of pressure of the 2D chiral perovskites (R-\/S-ClMBA)2SnI4 and (R-\/S-ClMBA)2GeI4 (ClMBA= chloromethylbenzylammonium), with the same structural motif of the already HP-PXRD investigated (R-\/S-\/Rac-ClMBA)2PbI4. Interesting structural and optical features as a function of the central metal have been discovered at ambient pressure, suggesting that evaluating the behaviour at variable pressure would permit further comprehension of the metal role. Moreover, moving away from toxic lead is a current challenge within the field, although only few lead-free chiral perovskites have been reported so far. Our structural experiment will be coupled to the Raman and photoluminescence characterization as a function of pressure, to fully investigate the behaviour of these 2D chiral perovskites upon compression and unveil the evolution of non-linear optical properties with different metal centers.","873":"The Quest for Exotic Oxidation States in Main-Group Cations and Transition-Metal Fluorides aims to synthesize and determine crystal structures of a novel oxygen cation and a novel nitrogen oxide cation, as well as the unprecedented high-oxidation-state transition metal fluorides stabilized by high pressure in a DAC. Transition-metal fluorides with new and unusual oxidation states would be synthesized by an innovative approach \u2013 laser-heating-induced decomposition of the respective fluoridometallate salts of pentafluoridoxenon(1+) cation. This proposal is composed of two parts: i) a selection of low risk targets with strong preliminary data and ii) an exploratory high-risk\u2013high-gain proof-of-concept research, that would, even if partially successful, open a new direction and provide strong case for further investigation and beamtime proposals.","874":"In this proposal, we use the case study of magnetite to assess how the initial burst of supersaturation experienced in automated syntheses affects the effectiveness of bioinspired polycations in controlling the final particle size and morphology. Concretely, we hypothesize that final magnetite nanoparticle size is directly correlated to the rate of formation of the initial amorphous organic\/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles. In order to test this assertion, we will correlate the length and linear charge density of charged amino acids, to their ability to maintain size control in syntheses carried out either with a robot or a conventional dosing unit. \n","875":"An unbroken cold chain is crucial for health, impacting vaccines, medical products, and daily food. Effective management and cost-efficient monitoring are challenging. Polymer micelles, such as the pentablock copolymer (qPDMAEMA85-PEO130-PPO44-PEO130-qPDMAEMA85), can serve as inexpensive indicators of refrigeration breakdown. By deeply understanding the micellization of this non-equilibrium system, we aim to develop a system for temperature-dependent and irreversible colloidal aggregation, indicating temporary heating above a threshold temperature. We use a micellar system with iron species at the centre of a flower-like micelle, previously shown to undergo irreversible aggregation upon heating. However, the process is not fully understood. Introducing Prussian blue nanoparticles can influence this aggregation, inhibiting its irreversibility. We plan to perform ASAXS measurements to investigate the location and role of the iron species during these processes in detail.","876":"Plastic waste pollution has become a major environmental issue in modern society, increasing the demand for recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Glycolysis process seems the better compromise to recycle PET in an economical and environmental way.In the frame of a PhD project, we study the activity of inherited species, and more specifically Antimony since it is by far the most used polycondensation catalyst for PET.Indeed, Sb is added as an oxide during polycondensation and converted into an organic species that act as a homogeneous catalyst. Therefore, Sb is present in every PET waste streams, and will affect PET chemical recycling.Studies have found that both oxidation states III and V can be found in waste streams, but the link with both species\u2019 activities has not been thoroughly covered.  We aim at establishing a clear link between oxidation state of antimony  and the catalytically active forms in a glycolysis reaction.EXAFS and XANES are the most fitting analyses for that.","877":"Here we propose to measure Ni K-beta X-ray emission spectroscopy and XAS to unambiguously assign the electronic structure to a recently reported oxygen-protected state of the hyperthermophile hydrogenase from Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus (HtSH). Although the crystal structure of this state indicates an unusual coordination of the Ni with three bridging cysteine residues and a terminal bidentate glutamate, two possible electronic structures have been proposed, a closed-shell singlet with a Ni(IV) and a Fe(II) at the active site, and an antiferromagnetically coupled open-shell singlet with a Ni(III) and an oxidized Fe(III). The proposed spin selective XES measurements should provide definitive evidence to assign the correct electronic structure.  ","878":"Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to produce propylene. Pt is a commercially used metal for PDH and Sn is the most commonly used promoter for Pt catalysts. The PDH reaction requires the activation of the C-H bond, meaning its kinetics depend on the electronic structure of the Pt. However, the energy levels of the d-states in Pt and Pt-containing alloys, which play a crucial role in directing bond formation, have rarely been directly measured experimentally. We have developed PtSn loaded Al2O3 catalysts with various Pt:Sn ratio, which showed very different propylene formation rate and deactivation rate. Here we apply for the Pt L3 edge RIXS study to measure the d-band of Pt and Pt-C bond strength after H2 activation, propane dehydrogenation and regeneration. Compared with different Pt:Sn ratio will determine the optimal electronic structure of Pt, providing fundamental descriptor in C-H activation.","879":"The development of membrane-electrode assembly flow cells has led to rapid progress in CO2 electrolysis and efforts are currently focused on enhancing catalysts to achieve superior selectivity and activity levels. Bimetallic catalysts have been proposed to enhance the selectivity of the reaction towards the production of C2+ products. The role of the nature of the catalyst and its electronic and atomic structural evolution during the reaction remains however ambiguous. To deepen our understanding of the correlation between the coordination environment of Cu-based bimetallic catalysts and the CO2RR properties, we propose to perform operando X-ray spectroscopy. This project is part of an MSCA-DN (ECOMATES - grant agreement No 101072830) with the development of a tender X-ray operando cell as deliverable. Our project aims at elucidating the local coordination environment and the dynamic behavior of bimetallic catalysts during operation by using ex-situ and operando X-ray spectroscopy.","880":"The high overpotential of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in water splitting hampers hydrogen production efficiency. While most OER catalysts follow the sluggish Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism (AEM), the newly discovered Lattice Oxygen Mediated (LOM) mechanism offers a more efficient pathway by involving redox-active lattice oxygen, drastically reducing overpotentials. However, the LOM reaction mechanism is poorly understood. Our research focuses on different phases of Co-based perovskite oxides to understand how a shift from AEM to LOM is fundamentally influenced by changes in Co-O bonding environment in different crystal phases rather than dopants. We will use Operando High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection-X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (HERFD-XAFS) to study the Co K Edge, monitoring evolution in coordination environment and electronic structure in the catalyst bulk under different voltages. This study aims to elucidate how crystal phase affects LOM activity","881":"In 2021, we reported the first instance of thorium\u2013thorium bonding in a crystalline cluster. This compound has sparked significant interest due to its hotly debated electronic structure, which is predicted by density functional theory to exhibit valence-delocalisation of two 6d electrons over three Th metal centres, leading to an antiferromagnetic 6d2 ground state. Ab initio RIXS calculations predict low energy transfer (<5 eV) 6d-6d and spin excitations, which will serve as direct experimental evidence of the electronic structure. We propose high energy resolution 2p6d RIXS at ID20 to test density functional theory predictions and settle the ongoing contention concerning the electronic structure of this molecule. By examining molecular Th analogues, we aim to demonstrate 2p6d RIXS as a reliable probe of valence d electron count in lanthanides and actinides.","882":"Lithium-ion batteries already play a crucial role in energy storage, but there is still plenty of room for improvement in performance. There is a lack of knowledge about the structure of the solvent\/anions around the Li+ in solution, mainly due to a lack of available techniques to study Li+ speciation. We propose to overcome this challenge by using X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) at the Li K edge at ID20 to validate our calculations, from which we will then be able to identify the coordination number around Li+ in solution. We will study a wide variety of electrolytes, allowing us to demonstrate that our approach is viable for both already commonly used electrolytes (e.g. Li[PF6] in carbonate solvents) and novel electrolytes that have the potential to overcome some traditional problems with commonly used electrolytes (e.g. ionic liquids).","883":"","884":"","885":"The nature of sulfur in magmatic systems, particularly silicate melts, is an important control its ultimate behaviour and role in volcanic processes, being related to ore formation or volcanic outgassing. Recent spectroscopic developments using XANES allow the study of the variations in S-species present in natural and synthetic glasses. We will determine S oxidation states in key samples to elucidate the variations of S-speciation in volcanic melt compositions with different fO2 and temperatures to constrain the fO2 conditions for the transition from sulfide (S2-) to sulfate (S6+) in silicate melts. In addition, selected natural samples representative of arc magmas from Southeast Asia will be studied to quantify the abundances of key sulfur species. Our XANES data will enable us to constrain volatiles dissolved in magma, both during magma storage and during magma evolution when traveling through the magma conduit pre-eruption, linking sulfur to eruptive behaviour and magma dynamics. ","886":"Chondrules (mm-size igneous spherules made of silicates) are the major components of primitive meteorites. Their origin is still debated: did they derive from planets or did they directly form in a mysterious nebular environment? Hence, deciphering their condition of formation is crucial for understanding the Solar system\u2019s evolution. Recently, some clues based on chemical and isotopic measurements have promoted nebular models. Although we lack data on their formation\u2019s environments, a promising approach would be to measure the oxygen fugacity (fO2) recorded during their formation (fO2 is dependent on the chemical environment). Reducing conditions are typical of nebular environments (log fO2~IW-7, IW being the Fe-FeO redox buffer) while planetary impacts generate oxidizing conditions (log fO2>IW). Here we propose to determine the valences of Ti, V and Cr in olivine grains contained in CV3 chondrites to estimate fO2 values and determine the environment of chondrules\u2019 formation.","887":"The goal of this proposal is to systematically study high pressure high temperature behavior of FeOOH along normal mantle and slabs geotherms by means of single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Spectroscopy (SMS). This study will have implications for modelling oxygen and water deep cycles, interpretation of seismic tomography data, and understanding of crystal chemistry of Fe-O-H system.","888":"The materials to be analyzed in this experiment are return samples from the Hayabusa 2 mission of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which were successfully collected from asteroid Ryugu and returned to Earth on the 5th of December, 2020. We will focus on the detection of high-Z rare earth elements (REE), as the most important geochemical signature of the returned unique (pristine) asteroid sample materials is represented by their trace element fingerprint and rare Earth element (REE) pattern. The systematic study of the absolute and relative concentrations of REE and their distribution between coexisting phases are important indicators for early processes of the formation of the first solids, their exchange with the surrounding Solar Nebula as well as hydrothermal processes on the fluid rich parent body. ","890":"A new, unique nano-focus instrumentation for rapid parallel XRF and XRD as well as X-ray imaging measurements at extreme pT conditions will be constructed on ID27. Funding for this project was partially obtained from German authorities in the framework of a BMBF project by M. Wilke (Potsdam), S. Jahn (Cologne) and D. Andrault (Clermont-Ferrand). The planned work is outlined in a collaboration contract between ESRF, University Potsdam and Cologne University (CL 0309). \r\nThe instrument benefits from the very small beam size and the ultimate brilliance provided by the new diffraction-limited synchrotron radiation source at ESRF. During the LTP the new instrument will be benchmarked and employed to perform cutting-edge experiments for understanding materials relevant to processes of the deep Earth. Additionally, this unique setup offers the possibility for applications ranging from materials sciences in the field of superhard or superdense materials to high-pressure solid-state physics.\r\n","891":"Understanding the fluxes of matter in the early Solar System is important to understand the processes of formation of planets. In particular, Earth formed in a water-poor area of the disk, and probably got hydrated by the input of external sources. Using nanofocus X-ray diffraction computed tomography, we aim at 1) characterizing hydrated minerals in hydrated micrometeorites (MM), still poorly characterized, and 2) characterizing the mineralogy of ultra-carbonaceous MMs which are exceptional samples from cometary regions. Detecting and characterizing minute amounts of hydrous phases require high spatial resolution and sensitivity, because of the size and the structural complexity of the grains. A previous experiment performed  has shown the feasibility of a structural study of sub-\u00b5m hydrated phases by nano-XRD-CT, despite limitations. Taking advantage of the upgrade of ID11 at ESRF, we aim at better understanding the formation processes of these  early Solar System materials.","892":"Self-organized, iron-silica(te) membranes might have served as redox catalysts in the early Earth hydrothermal systems proposed as niches for the emergence of metabolism. Moreover, they have similar morphologies and composition to biologic iron filaments found in silica-rich rocks, including those considered the oldest on Earth. Yet, available information on the mineralogy of these nanocomposite membranes comes from experiments-analyses performed in presence of oxygen. To investigate their formation and composition in anoxic conditions that were prevailing in early Earth, we will perform the their growth in capillaries inside a glovebox chamber and characterize them at the nanoscale using high-energy X-ray scattering experiments, combined with PDF analysis, while maintaining them in inert atmosphere. These results will advance our knowledge on early Earth mineralogy, the catalytic role of such membranes in prebiotic chemistry and the recognition of traces of life in the rock record.","893":"Non-Newtonian fluids change viscosity under the application of stress, and understanding the properties and phase transitions of these fluids are important to create models of their flow behaviour in porous media. Certain non-Newtonian fluids crystallize in the absence of stress, and behave like an approximate Bingham fluid. When sufficient stress is applied, the viscosity drops significantly so that the material flows like a fluid with minimal shear forces. The spatial dynamic behaviour of these complex fluids in complicated geometries is surprisingly unknown. Here, we propose time-resolved X-ray diffraction computed tomography to spatially and chemically map the interplay between flow regimes, crystallization, and the local geometrical constraints on complex fluids in several distinct sample environments, to better understand the physical behaviour of complex fluids flowing in complex porous media.","894":"In this experiment we would like to explore the link between the local\/medium atomic arrangement and the average structure in crystals showing modulations. In particular, the aim is to test the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) technique in the investigation of these complex structures. Three minerals were chosen taking into account their well-known modulated structures: quartz, natrite (sodium carbonate) and calaverite (AuTe2) will be measured using X-ray powder diffraction, collecting total scattering data.","895":"Throughout geological history, organic-rich shales show systematic enrichment in uranium compared to other crustal rocks. Uranium concentrations vary significantly (< 5 to > 500ppm) among these shales in both time and space, as a result of global changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere and oceans through geological time, as well as local physical and chemical conditions of sedimentation and diagenetic processes. This experiment will be the first to use high resolution XANES spectroscopy to characterize U speciation in marine sediments. The aim of the study is to check the hypothesis that sorption rather than simple reduction might control the primary correlation between organic carbon content and U in shales.","897":"Understanding the factors that control nucleation and growth of solid phases in porous media, and how they differ from the bulk, is of fundamental importance given the large reactive surface areas of nanopores in subsurface and soil environments. Previous studies have shown that fluids in nanopores can hold higher supersaturations than bulk fluids, due to the existence of a so-called \u2018crystallization pressure\u2019 which is inversely proportional to the size of the nanopore. Moreover, coordination chemistry of confined complexes differs from that of bulk solutions, with some ions adopting different symmetries, which has an impact on nucleation and growth processes. Here, we aim to further explore these effects by (i) determining the symmetry of Sr(II) ions and neutral SrSO40 ion-pair species adsorbed in silica gel nanopores, and (ii) by performing SrSO4 precipitation experiments in mesoporous silica gels and following the changes in short-range order using Sr K-edge EXAFS experiments. ","898":"Seismic data from the Earth\u2019s core and different accretion scenarios implicate the presence of elements lighter than Fe or Ni to explain the observed seismic density deficit. Here we propose to study in detail the compression behaviour of iron-compounds relevant for the Earth\u2019s core (FeO, Fe3C, Fe7C3, FeS, Fe3S, FeSi) using high energy-resolved X-ray Absorption Near Edges Spectroscopy (XANES) up to 150 GPa.\r\nSuch data are presently not available due to experimental difficulties, but are fundamental for constraining the Earth\u2019s core composition. We plan to use the new compression data on endmembers to develop machine learning programming based on artificial intelligence in collaboration with the University of Toronto. ","900":"The main objective of this study is to investigate the incorporation mechanism of the fluid mobile element (FME) strontium in hydrous minerals (serpentine) from HERFD-XANES measurements on natural rock samples. This information is essential to better predict fluid-related geological processes in subduction zones that are not captured directly in natural obducted rocks, including the discharge depth of fluids, their pathways and sources of arc magmas. Data on FME incorporation in minerals of natural rocks are presently not available because the signal of highly diluted trace elements is often obscured by those of major coexisting elements. HERFD-XAS measurements permit to extract the signal of a single element contained in micrometric size mineral phases, but require a high photon flux. This limitations can now be circumvented at the ESRF-EBS that provides the necessary high flux for performing such challenging measurements.","901":"The aim of the proposed experiments is to provide new insights into cassiterite solubility and tin speciation in various hydrous supercritical fluids at pressures and temperatures relevant for formation of hydrothermal tin ore deposits using a hydrothermal autoclave and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. For a more comprehensive understanding of tin complexation and speciation in supercritical fluids and conclusions on cassiterite-precipitating reactions two different hypotheses will be tested. On the one hand, the experimental approach enables to determine cassiterite solubility in H2O-HCl solutions and simultaneously establish the Sn(II)\/Sn(IV) ratio in the fluid as function of oxygen fugacity at high temperatures and high pressures. And on the other hand, we will study cassiterite solubility in in alkali carbonate fluids.","902":"This project aims to improve our knowledge about molybdenum speciation in hydrothermal fluids that are responsible for ore deposit formation. The obtained results will contribute to a quantitative description of the role of S3\u2022- ion in molybdenum transport and ore deposition. In situ data on the molybdenum speciation in alkaline fluids depending on the silica content at various conditions will allow to better assess the thermodynamic models of molybdenum transport at high TP in natural systems.","903":"In previous high-pressure experiments, the emergence of sp3-hybridized tetrahedral carbonate anions was shown for CaCO3 above 100 GPa by Raman spectroscopy. Recent ab initio calculations, however, have shown that much lower pressures of ~20 GPa could be required for the synthesis of sp3-orthocarbonates Ca3CO5 and Ca2CO4. The latter phase was recently successfully synthesized, though the structure and stability limits of the former one have not been assessed experimentally yet. The main objective of the proposal is to investigate the formation and crystal structure of novel sp3-orthocarbonate Ca3CO5 and the reaction of its decomposition into CaCO3 and another sp3-orthocarbonate Ca2CO4 by means of angle-dispersive in situ x-ray diffraction in multianvil press.","904":"Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and its phase transitions have been extensively studied mainly due to its geological importance. The current proposal is aimed to explore the CaCO3 phase diagram at pressures above 10 GPa and 1400 \u00b0C by means of angle-dispersive in situ x-ray diffraction in multianvil press. We propose identifying and characterizing the latest observed unknown phases of CaCO3 (Litasov et al. 2020). Preliminary in-situ x-ray diffraction experiments at HP-HT indicated a potential aragonite\u2019s amorphisation, that needed to be confirmed. We believe that a proper understanding of the CaCO3 phase diagram is fundamental for Earth sciences and, in particular, for the global C cycle.","905":"Major processes such as plate tectonics and seismic activity are driven by the physical state and physical properties of mantle rocks. Nonetheless, the elastic behaviour of mantle rocks at P\u2013T conditions relevant to the Earth's mantle has never been investigated. It is the Equations of State (EoS) of minerals that allow the physical properties of rocks to be inferred. However, performing such conversion \u2013 from single- to multi-phase EoS \u2013 requires upscaling from minerals to rocks. This beamtime is intended to bridge this gap. To this aim, we propose to investigate, for the first time, the elastic behaviour of multi-phase, natural bulk rock samples at P\u2013T conditions relevant to the Earth's mantle. Results will have a major impact on our understanding of how single-phase EoS are related to each other in multi-phase systems and will contribute to building more accurate models for the variations of bulk rock physical properties in the uppermost layer of the Earth\u2019s mantle.","906":"Feldspars are rock-forming minerals that are abundant in various geological environments. Recently we have discovered new high-pressure polymorphs of anorthite (An), albite, microcline at pressures above 10 GPa that feature Al and Si in increased five- and six-fold coordination. Our preliminary ex situ multi anvil experiments have shown that new polymorph An can persist at greater depths than previously thought along colder than average mantle geotherms. Herein we propose to re-visit the HT-HP phase diagram of An to define the stability field of the new polymorph and to investigate its decomposition reactions. The results will be provide mineral physics contain on behaviour of one of the major component of cold and ultra-cold subducting slabs and their seismic activity.","907":"In this proposal we aim to investigate the structural evolution and the P-T stability range of two hydrated borates species, inyoite and jadarite, of which elastic parameters (i.e., thermal expansion coefficient, bulk volume compressibility, elastic anisotropy) and P-T stability fields are currently unknown. Such investigations will provide information about the phase stability of these minerals which can be potentially employed as aggregates in neutron-shielding concretes. Previous experiments at high-pressure conducted on other hydrated borates revealed the presence of several phase transitions. Therefore, the high-pressure data of inyoite and jadarite will be compared with our previous results on other borates species, improving our knowledge on this class of minerals at high-pressure conditions. ","908":"The study of Pb-containing compounds under high-pressure can help to understand the process of \u2018activation\u2019 of lone pair.

The knowledge about such a crystal structures has major relevance for physical properties of the materials.","910":"The proposal concerns the study of high-pressure phase transformations and elastic and structural behaviour of alkali-carbonates in the system Ca-Na-K-REE-C-O at Earth\u2019s mantle pressures, by single crystal X-ray diffraction. We will focus on  burbankite, (Na,Ca)3(Ca,La,Ce)3(CO3)5, and high pressure (Na,K)2Ca3(CO3)4 carbonate. Both structures are on the liquidus of carbonatitic melts at P > 4 GPa. The knowledge of their physical properties is fundamental to understand and quantitatively model the fractionation of trace elements and the processes related to the concentrations of strategic elements, such as those in REE-carbonatite. The possible identification of higher-pressure structures, at mantle transition zone and lower mantle will be fundamental to understand carbonatitic systems also at ultra-high-pressures and planetary conditions.","911":"Ferropericlase (Fp) and bridgmanite (Brg) are the dominant minerals of the Earth\u2019s lower mantle. Recent discoveries on the deep-water cycle demonstrate that water can be delivered to the deepest portions of the lower mantle. Even though Fp and Brg have been intensively investigated over the last decades, our current knowledge on high-pressure (HP)-high-temperature (HT) reactions of Fp and Brg with water is very limited.  In order to provide a comprehensive picture on Fp-H2O and Brg-H2O interactions at HP-HT conditions of the lower mantle, we propose to perform multi-methodological studies employing both in situ powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (SMS).","912":"The staggeringly diverse and abundant teleost fishes account for 99% of the 36,000 living species of ray-finned fishes. Despite an abundance of exceptional three-dimensional fossils, our understanding of the anatomy and relationships of the early members of this group is poorly constrained. Early teleosts are both taxonomically and morphologically diverse, and their anatomically complex skulls and braincases have the potential to resolve outstanding questions. Propagation phase contrast synchrotron X-ray \u00b5CT of key early teleost specimens provides an unrivalled opportunity to peer inside the heads of these fossils. By revealing new and detailed anatomical information, questions of phylogenetic affinity and morphological innovation leading to the extant teleost radiation can be confronted. Once a robust hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships has been established, macroevolutionary patterns relating to teleost evolution, diversification, and extinction pressures can be investigated.","913":"The aim of this experiment is to characterize the dynamics of capillary trapping in heterogeneous sandstones for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Capillary trapping, essential for a sites long term storage security, is underpinned by pore-scale physics. Experimental observations resolving trapping over many pores, representative of the large-scale process, are crucial for model validation, development and ultimately storage predictions. To date, there have been no direct observations of transient trapping in sandstones with realistic layered rock heterogeneities, features which are ubiquitous in nature across proposed and operational storage sites worldwide. This experimental campaign will characterize the trapping dynamics in heterogeneous sandstones for the first time, utilizing the ID19 beamline at the ESRF Synchrotron. ","914":"We propose to use the KORE rig installed at the beamline ID19 at ESRF, coupled with X-ray tomography and acoustic emissions to simulate conditions relevant to magma fracturing prior to and at the onset of explosive volcanic eruptions. We specifically plan to record the in situ, time-resolved evolution of the synthetic magma microstructures and the sound waves produced by sample fracturing at conditions of temperature and stress of magma fragmentation leading to explosive eruptions relevant to shallow (< 4 km depth) magma reservoirs feeding active volcanoes. These results offer the opportunity to better illuminate the causes of explosive eruptions and, with appropriate upscaling, how to apply seismic imaging for detecting the proximity of gas-rich magma to the surface.","915":"This project aims to assess of the trace element composition of the mineral reidite, a rare high-pressure polymorph of the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4) that forms during hypervelocity impacts of asteroids with the Earth and other planetary bodies. Zircon is the most widely used chronometer in the geosciences but little is known about the chemical composition of reidite, and thus whether it might be useful in the direct absolute dating of the impact events in which it forms. X-ray fluorescence tomography (XRF-CT) has previously been applied to non-impact-related zircon on the ID16B beamline and we will follow this established protocol to gain the first insights into the chemical composition of reidite.","916":"The Kola superdeep borehole (SG-3) is the result of a scientific drilling project (realized in 1970-1992) in the Pechengsky District, near the Russian border with Norway, on the Kola Peninsula. This borehole of 12,262 meters retains the deepest artificial point on Earth. This project is the first attempt to characterize Au nanoparticles in natural fluid inclusions inside quartz from this borehole using micro-beam scanning small-angle\/wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/WAXS) techniques combined with simultaneous X-ray fluorescence (XRF), anomalous SAXS (ASAXS) and X-ray near edge structure (XANES). These new data are indispensable for the knowledge of Au behavior in deep fluid systems and the mechanism of its accumulation in the Earth\u2019s crust.","917":"The Earth\u2019s core is mainly composed of Fe and Ni, alloyed with lighter elements, as highlighted by the seismologically observed density deficit. Among the list of light elements, Si and O are among the most favoured. However a debate around a possible incompatibility between both light elements has recently been raised (Hirose et al. 2017). In fact, combined presence of both elements alloyed with iron is not possible due to the exsolution in the liquid state of SiO2. \r\nConventional Laser-Heating Diamond Anvil Cell (LH-DAC) experiments have several drawbacks for constraining SiO2 exsolution in the liquid state. In particular, above the eutectic temperature, the different phases are migrating due to thermal gradient related to the laser Gaussian shape (Morard et al. 2017). To overcome this experimental issue, we propose to use laser-driven dynamic compression combined with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy.","918":"The distribution of heat-producing trace elements including uranium (U) and thorium (Th) between a silicate and metal melt is a key parameter to reconstruct the formation history of the Earth\u2019s core, its composition and initial heat budget. The main objective of this study is to unambiguously investigate the valance of  U and Th contained in silicate glasses (600 ppm) synthesized previously at Early Earth's conditions (highly reducing). This knowledge is crucial to interpret their experimentally observed silicate-metal melt distribution behaviors and to deduce their abundances in the Earth\u2019s core. U and Th valence can only be determined unambiguously from High-energy-resolution-fluorescence (HERFD) X-ray Near Edge Absorption Spectroscopy measurements at the M4 edges, which remain challenging at these high dilution levels. ID26 and BM20 are the few instruments in Europe allowing acquiring such data also thanks to the significant flux increase of the ESRF-EBS.","919":"The experiment aims to investigate the elastic and thermodynamic properties of Fe-Si-C alloy at pressures above 200 GPa and temperatures of thousands of degrees by means of the Nuclear Inelastic Scattering (NIS) technique and powder X-ray diffraction. NIS is a powerful tool for the study of lattice dynamics that provides a full thermodynamic sample characterization. The measured phonon density of states provides the Debye phonon average velocity (VD), which together with density and bulk modulus, determined by complementary X-ray diffraction measurements, are the necessary parameters for calculating the compressional velocity (VP) and shear velocity (VS) of the material. Our measurements will allow refining the amount of Si and C required to explain the observed seismic profile of the Earth\u2019s core.","921":"The autonomous construction of shelters using in-situ resources, such as via additive manufacturing (3D printing) of regolith feedstock, is a necessary prerequisite and priority to sustain longer duration human presence on the Moon from both a cost and risk perspective. We aim to use powder diffraction data to generate the baseline fundamental description of simulants \u2018TUBS-M\u2019 and \u2018TUBS-T\u2019, with a particular emphasis on phase evolution during sintering and recrystallization. For improved fidelity we propose here to look at the expected strong influence of systematically incorporating two distinct volatile-containing glass beads types according to returned Apollo specimens to 1) characterise the state of the sample during the process as a function of glass content, 2) observe sintering rates as a function of the same, and 3) model sintering behaviour, supported by external mechanical testing.","922":"Measuring in situ and real-time stress of samples in high-pressure and -temperature multi-anvil press deformation experiments has traditionally required a synchrotron for x-ray diffraction. However, by utilizing a piezoelectric crystal disk, such as quartz or GaPO4, in the deformation column within the assembly, it is possible to measure this stress in situ and real-time with typical laboratory equipment without requiring x-ray diffraction. This assembly has been designed and multiple experiments have already been done in the laboratory confirming the potential piezoelectric crystals. By using x-ray diffraction results as the control and comparing with piezoelectric measurements, the technique can be proven viable. Having an assembly able to measure in situ stresses during deformation experiments with multi-anvil presses in any laboratory without requiring a synchrotron will open many avenues of research into deformation of samples at high pressures and temperatures.","923":"Laboratory measurement of the elastic wave velocities of major minerals relevant to planet\u2019s mantle are crucial to constrain the composition, mineralogy and temperature of the otherwise inaccessible deep interior of Earth. Ringwoodite is the most abundant phase in the lower half of the Earth\u2019s transition zone (TZ). However, almost all existing measurements of its elastic properties are restricted to pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions significantly below those of the mantle geotherm, with many made outside ringwoodite\u2019s stability field. We propose to experimentally measure the acoustic velocities of ringwoodite with compositions between (Mg0.9Fe0.1)2SiO4 and (Mg0.5Fe0.5)2SiO4 at relevant mantle PT conditions using ultrasonic interferometry in the multi-anvil press. When combined with synchrotron X-ray source, it\u2019s possible to accurately determine the pressure, density and length of the sample, therefore allow precise sound wave velocities to be obtained.","924":"Hematite (Fe2O3) is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust. Hematite is one of the major components of banded iron formations (BIFs) and ironstones and its high-pressure high-temperature (HP-HT) behaviour may therefore have significant consequences for modelling of the earth\u2019s interior as reported in [1]. In spite of such an apparent crucial interest, high pressure melting experiments on this prototype material are lacking. This is why we propose here to investigate HP-HT) behaviour of Fe2O3 hematite using X-Ray diffraction at ID06-LVP ESRF beamline of the ESRF in order to determine in the P-T space: i) the decomposition conditions of Fe2O3 = Fe3O4 + O2, ii) the melting of hematite Fe2O3 (s) = Fe2O3 (l), 3i) potential formation of other oxides as Fe-O P-T phase diagram was recently reported to be richer than previously thought (FeO2, Fe4O5, Fe5O7, Fe25O32, \u2026). Note that our preliminary studies indicate no decomposition at P \u2265 10 GPa. ","925":"Like other perovskite minerals, calcium silicate perovskite (capv) undergoes a series of subtle crystallographic phase transitions with temperature (and pressure). These tiny symmetry changes in capv are associated with disproportionately large elastic anomalies. However, variability within existing estimates of the slope of capv\u2019s phase transitions prevent them from being used to interpret mantle seismological observations. We propose to study the crystallography of capv at conditions up to at least 50 GPa and 2000 K in the large volume press on ID06 by using sintered diamond anvils for pressure generation. ID06-LVP is the only global setup with proven diffraction resolution to unambiguously identify phase transitions of capv, and thus provides an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the explanation for seismic heterogeneities throughout the Earth\u2019s deep mantle.","926":"To better understand and quantify the Iodine contribution of volcanic systems to the atmosphere, we propose to study Iodine partitioning in almost-natural subduction related systems using natural basalt and synthetic trondhjemite both coexisting with a I-enriched hydrous fluid. We will determine the Iodine content for all phases in situ during successive decompression of the system. It will allow us to calculate partition coefficients and to estimate magmatic Iodine fluxes. we will better understand the process of Iodine-release from the melt during its ascent and magmatic degassing. Furthermore, the results can give insight to the Iodine\r\ncontent in magmatic systems. For the first time, we will use a natural basaltic rock for these types of experiments on Iodine. To reach the solidus of the basalt we will also for the first time combine a modified Bassett type hydrothermal diamond anvil cell with a laser heating system.","927":"Iron is the only geo- and cosmo-chemically abundant element with variable oxidation state that could affect interiors of Earth and super-Earth planets. Recent work of our group and collegues reveal complex crystal chemistry of Fe-O system at pressures up to ~100 GPa. Even at this pressure range information about oxidation state of iron in different geochemically relevant compounds is inconsistent due to severe experimental problems. Aim of this project is to perform parallel single crystal X-ray diffraction  and synchrotron Mossbauer study of three model compounds (ferropericalse (Mg0.8Fe0.2)O, ringwoodite (Mg0.5Fe0.5)2SiO4, and bridgmanite (Mg0.8Fe0.2)(Si0.95Al0.05)O3) at 150, 250, and 300 GPa heated up to ~4000 K. As outcome of this project we will establish if this materials are chemically stable, or what are products of their decomposition, what is oxidation and electronic state of iron in corresponding compounds and if it affected by relevant pressures and temperatures.","928":"In this experiment, we plan to study Fe-Si-C ternary system at high-pressure high-temperature conditions. This system is of significant importance for constraining the composition of the Earth\u2019s inner core as well as of other terrestrial planets. Yet, information on the phase relations in this ternary system at extreme conditions is scarce. The aim of the experiment is to investigate which phases in the iron-rich part of the ternary Fe-Si-C system are stable under conditions relevant to the deep Earth\u2019s interior.","930":"This study uses fossils of the geologically oldest-known pelagic marine reptiles to elucidate the adaptive evolution, timescale, and environmental context of the earliest tetrapod transition to life in the open sea. The remains include an articulated skull and tail-fin section representing at least two different earliest Triassic (~249 Ma) ichthyosaur taxa. These were discovered on Svalbard in the Scandinavian Arctic. The specimens are well-preserved but encased in hard limestone concretions that are difficult to prepare without damaging the fragile bones. The dense matrix also has crystalline calcite inclusions that are resistant to conventional micro-CT. High-resolution PPC-SR-micro-CT is therefore crucial to comprehensively analyse the osteology, functional morphology, and bone microstructure of these unique skeletal remnants. Such data will underpin accurate reconstructions of lifestyle and determine both the phylogenetic and palaeoecological implications of the first ichthyosaurs.","932":"The permeability of many rocks and ores is low but can increase dramatically during fluid-rock interaction via formation of connected porosity induced by mineral\r\nreplacement reactions. Such reaction-induced porosity contributes to metasomatism, metal transport and ore deposition, as well as in situ metal recovery from\r\norebodies. Our recent work has demonstrated that reaction-induced porosity is sensitive to reaction parameters such as pore pressure and temperature, but the\r\ndynamics of reaction-induced porosity remains poorly understood. We plan to perform in situ X-ray \u03bcCT experiment (up to 190 \u00b0C, 20 MPa) to investigate the\r\neffect of pore fluid pressure, confining pressure, and temperature on the dynamics of reaction-induced porosity during the replacement of calcite by magnesite,\r\nbrucite, gypsum, and anhydrite. The new knowledge should help more accurate reactive transport modelling for minerals exploration, sustainable metal extraction,\r\nand CO2-sequestration.","933":"Near mid-oceanic ridges, microseismicity develops in large volumes of the oceanic crust and is interpreted to result from the hydration of oceanic rocks with a solid volume increase of up to 50%. Our recent work has demonstrated that this process, called reaction-induced fracturing, occurs in a model system where periclase is hydrated into brucite, and breaks the rock around it. However, the effect of one critical parameter, the pore fluid pressure, remains to be studied because it may control the rate of fracture development. We plan to perform deformation experiments using the new KORE apparatus to elucidate the effect of pore fluid pressure on reaction-induced fracturing. For the first time, we will couple 1) dynamic X-ray tomography experiments under varying pore fluid pressure conditions, up to 80 MPa, and 2) recording of the acoustic emission activities produced by rapid crack growth (i.e., microseismicity). This proposal is part of the ERC Adv. Grant BREAK awarded to the PI.","935":"This proposal is related to the H2020-MSCA-ITN project P-TRAP (www.h2020-p-trap.eu). P-TRAP aims at intercepting the flux of phosphorus (P) from agricultural areas and aquatic sediments into surface waters and, by this, at improving surface water quality status. The scientific concept, unifying the individual PhD research projects in P-TRAP, is based on the naturally close coupling of the biogeochemical cycles of iron (Fe) and P in soils and sediments. In this ESRF experiment, we will focus on 2 PhD projects connected to two work packages within P-TRAP: 1) Using Fe-containing by-products from water treatment to develop filter systems to remove water at the outlet of tile drains; 2) Adding Fe-containing by-products from treating drinking water to lakes in order to reduce the internal P loading of lakes. Using the SXM we aim to unravel the connection between the formation, transformations and dissolution of solid Fe phases and its consequences for the mobility and bioavailability of P. ","936":"Phosphorus is a critical resource required for the production of agricultural fertilizers and is mainly produced from sedimentary phosphates rocks. These rocks usually contain rare earth elements, and potentially become a future REE reserves. Among the various REE, the cerium (Ce) shows relatively high concentration and variable negative anomaly indicative of the oxidation of Ce3+ into Ce4+ due to either microbial activity and\/or different conditions (redox, pH, depth). Hence, in this proposal, we wish to characterize the in-situ distribution, speciation, and redox of Ce in phosphate rock from Morocco using a combination of \u03bc-XRF, HR-XANES and HR-EXAFS to elucidate, i) the in-situ distribution and the concentration of Ce, ii) the Ce bearing minerals and the enrichment process, iii) the speciation of Ce (fixation mode, oxidation state). Results will guide the possible REE recovery, as well as to understand the geochemistry of enrichments to better assess the deposition conditions.\r\n\r\n ","937":"We will exploit the new High Power Laser Facility (HPLF) at ID-24 to determine the chemical reactivity of iron with hydrogen and\/or carbon at extreme pressure and temperature conditions on nanosecond timescale. Using a laser-driven dynamic compression approach, we will compress Fe-doped polystyrene samples, reaching conditions where carbon and hydrogen separate (~150 GPa, 5000 K). The element-specific XANES probe will then record how the iron nanoparticles react with either (presumably metallic) H and\/or insulating C. This experiment, which is currently only possible at ESRF, will be a door-opener to access element-specific chemistry in dynamic compression experiments. If successful, our proof-of-principle study will enable various follow-up experiments with science cases ranging from geophysics, giant impacts and properties of exoplanets to dynamic synthesis of room-temperature superconductors.","938":"The experiment aims to investigate the electronic configurations, structural transitions, and magnetism in iron Fe4O5 utilizing the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source spectroscopy and Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction at high pressure-temperature conditions (up to 80 GPa and 1500 K), and to determine their potential influence on the properties of the Earth\u2019s deep interior.","939":"We propose to study the relationship between short-range and long-range order in some layered lead oxychlorides characterized by a high degree of static disorder. The phases, consisting of layers of edge-sharing OPb4 tetrahedra alternated by Cl sheets, have a general formula Pb7XO8Cl2 with X= I, MO, As, V, Si. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) data obtained with laboratory instruments and preliminary XAS data obtained on BM08 \u201cLISA\u201d at ESRF suggest that the lack of long-range ordering associated with the substitution of Pb by the X cations is related to a disordered occurrence the cavities hosting these elements within the OPb4 layer and\/or to a disorder in the layer stacking. The superstructure and the correlated disorder of the structure could be analysed and understood with a precise diffraction measurement and a diffuse pattern mapping. ","941":"The study of the evolution of the structure upon pressure is indispensable for the understanding of many geological processes. In particular, the structure of CaF2 and of the other compounds presenting the so-called fluorite type time-averaged structure has been widely investigated by diffraction methods. However, due to the technical difficulties to obtain suitable Pair Distribution Functions (PDF) at high pressure, the role of the local structure in the evolution of these minerals upon compression is still virtually unexplored. With the new EBS of ESRF and the setup available at ID15a, it can be now possible to study these materials with total scattering in situ as a function of the pressure. In this experiment, we will explore the local arrangement of two fluorite-type minerals (CaF2 and BaF2) tracing a link between disordered local structure and the average behavior upon compression.","942":"This proposal combines two different experiments, aiming to use beam time as efficient as possible: (1) synchrotron diffraction experiments for texture analysis of sheet silicate rich rocks from the Eastern Alps to assess their significance for seismic anisotropy and (2) in-beam sedimentation experiments with clay minerals which will elucidate the onset of microstructure formation, relevant for the usage of clay rocks for societal challenges like carbon sequestration or nuclear waste storage. Both experiments can be conducted parallel during the same beam time period. The samples of Exp. 1 will be measured with frequent sample changes. At the same time, we start ~24h sedimentation experiments, measured in regular time steps. Both experiments can be seen as endmembers of rock fabric evolution, the first one representing an evolved state after experiencing geologic and tectonic modification and the second one representing the onset and early state of the microstructural evolution.  ","943":"Carbonate minerals are  present not only in the Earth crust, but even in the deeper part of our planet, being involved in the carbon cycle. In this view, we selected BaCO3 (witherite) and SrCO3 (strontianite), which exhibit the RT structure of aragonite. Upon temperature increase, these two minerals show phases transitions, that for now, were studied only taking into account the average structure. Interestingly, no structural analysis on the local structure by Pair Distribution Function (PDF) has ever been considered .To determine a link between the local structure and their behaviours upon heating, we propose an investigation using total scattering data collection. BaCo3 and SrCO3 will be investigated as well as their calcium counterpart (calcite and aragonite). Results will allow us to obtain a structural characterization of the average and local structure giving new insight into the evolution of these minerals as a function of the temperature and their role in the carbon cycle.

We aim to use powder diffraction data to generate the baseline fundamental description of high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants incorporating synthesised glasses and agglutinates, with a particular emphasis on phase evolution during sintering and recrystallization. Liquid presence sintering of matched site-specific compositions is investigated up to 1100\u00b0C.","945":"This project aims at obtaining a detailed information on the local structure of Nd and Dy in  Zircon (ZrSiO4) and Pyrochlore ((Ce,Ca,Y)2(Nb,Ta)2O6(OH,F)). Due to similar geochemical behaviour of REEs, it is notoriously difficult to separate them. Detailed structural informationon the local environment of Dy and Nd in crystalline phases like zircon and pyrochlore and in silicate melts can help in obtaining deeper insight on the mechanisms affecting  REE partition coefficients between melts and crystalline phases growing in the  melts. This proposal is the first step for a larger project aiming at studying REE structural role in crystals and  silicate glasses and REE partition coefficients between crystals and silicate melts. The structural results we will obtain from the proposed measurements can help to understand the mechanisms affecting REE partition coefficients between crystals and melts and, thus can help finding new routes for REE extraction from industrial and electronic wastes.","946":"Mississippi Valley type (MVT) Pb-Zn deposits are becoming the main supply of germanium resources worldwide. In such deposits, sphalerite (ZnS) mineral is the main Ge-hosting mineral, which can show very contrasted Ge-contents (0-500 ppm). Such variability strongly questions the deposition conditions during the formation of the deposit. Understanding the deposit formation processes is of great importance to efficiently and sustainably exploit these rare metal deposits.\r\nIn this proposal we wish to use \u03bc-XRF mapping coupled to high-resolution \u03bc-XANES\/EXAFS at the Ge K-edge in order to, 1) identify the distribution of Ge in various sphalerite minerals showing different colors and formation stages in the deposit, 2) characterize the crystal chemistry of Ge in sphalerite (i.e., speciation and substitution modes), 3) study enrichment mechanisms of Ge in these high grade Ge-rich Pb-Zn deposits. ","947":"Quartz, one of the main constituents of the Earth\u2019s crust, undergoes a phase transition (\uf061-\uf062) with increasing temperature. However, the temperature at which this transition occurs at high pressure and its very nature, i.e., whether it is a first or a second order, merely displacive, transformation is not clear. In addition, thermodynamics databases predict a dramatic increase in compression wave velocity, Vp in the \uf062 field with depth, which results in the attribution of high velocity zones in seismic tomography data to the \uf061-\uf062 transition. Therefore, an accurate characterization of the pressure and temperature (PT) position of the transition and the associated velocity changes will provide valuable data for the interpretation of seismic velocities. Here, we propose to investigate the cell parameters of \uf061-\uf062 quartz at ID06 to relate PT to phase change. XRD data will be combined to measurements of ultrasonic velocities to track the evolution of Vp across the transition.","948":"Al-bearing stishovite and, later, post-stishovite becomes one of the chief hydrogen-bearing phases in subducted oceanic crust (eclogite) at lower mantle conditions.\r\n\r\nThis study aims to establish the effect of the incorporation of defects typical of eclogitic systems (Al, Ti, Fe) on the high-P-T phase diagram, density, structure and elasticity of hydrated stishovite. In particular, we intend to determine, for the first time, the compressional (VP) and shear wave velocities (VS) that precisely locate the stishovite to post-stishovite phase transition in P and T space using model eclogitic Al-, Ti-, Fe- and H2O-bearing SiO2 compositions.\r\n\r\nThis will be completed by application of state-of-the-art in situ x-ray diffraction combined with simultaneous ultrasonic interferometry and imaging at ID06-LVP.

Icy satellites are the only planetary bodies beyond Earth where the presence of liquid water has been discovered. Low-mass organic compounds are expected to be dissolved in the subsurface oceans and to act as precursors for synthesis of biologically relevant organic compounds in the oceans\u2019 depths. The oceans of icy satellites span over the P-T conditions at which the dissolved organic molecules are expected to be encapsulated into clathrate hydrates. There is no data on organic clathrates at high pressure, their phase stabilities, crystal structures, compressibility and thermal expansion. This information is crucial in understanding the astrobiological potential of icy planets\u2019 oceans, therefore, we propose to investigate clathrate hydrates with biologically relevant organic molecules by means of in situ single-crystal XRD at both high pressures and low temperatures.  ","951":"Magnesium silicate post-perovskite phase (PPv) is widely regarded as the most likely candidate to explain seismic anomalies observed at the Earth\u2019s D\u2019\u2019 discontinuity. However, direct sound velocity measurements on isotropic polycrystalline MgSiO3 bridgmanite (Brg) and PPv showed no significant Vs positive jump at phase boundary which is inconsistent with seismic observations. Since PPv is known to develop strong fabrics upon transforming from Brg, we would like to combine synchrotron multigrain crystallography and Brillouin spectroscopy to investigate the nature of phase-transition-induced texture of PPv and its influence on sound velocity. Our results will help understand whether the transformation-textured PPv reasonably reproduces the observations of Vs jump and anisotropic features at the D\u2019\u2019 discontinuity. This will offer unprecedent evidence on the genesis of the D\u2019\u2019 discontinuity with implications for our views on the dynamics of the Earth\u2019s lowermost mantle.","952":"The study of dinosaur reproduction and development is one of the most exciting fields in palaeontology, but dinosaur babies are extremely rare Micro-CT scan revealed a perinatal ornithopod dinosaur encased in a small block of sandstone. The specimen is 70% complete and articulated, being one of the most complete dinosaurs of Portugal, one of the oldest perinatal ornithopod dinosaurs of the world, and the oldest of Europe. We will use synchrotron x-ray imaging to (1) improve our available 3D model (2) identify additional bones and soft tissue (cartilage and skin), and (3) produce tomographic histological sections to assess the ontogenetic state of the specimen. We will obtain a high-quality 3D reconstruction of the full specimen, coupled with submicron resolution data on key areas of interest.

Soot, minerals and blooming pigmented algae developing in supraglacial e surface environments directly affect snow and ice darkening, lowering their albedo and thus increasing surface melting by up to 26% locally. Accuracy of albedo models is fundamental for the prediction of future GrIS melt dynamics. However, crucial information, such as the 3D distribution of mineral-soot-microbe particle aggregates within the ice matrix as well as average sizes, depth and interaction between microbes, minerals and ice crystals in the first meter of ice, remain unknown. To address this gap, we want to use the cryo-CT capabilities of ID19 and analyze ice cores from Greenland to elucidate the influence of biological material and minerals on the structure of glacier ice. Such information is crucial for our ability to predict future melting rates of the GrIS.","954":"Copper salts are  sprayed on grapevine leaves to treat fungal diseases, especially in organic agriculture where it is the only allowed fungicides.

Further, organic polymer coating like chitosan is efficient at controlling labile nanoparticle dissolution. Yet, the foliar uptake and the spatially resolved transformation of these nanoformulations at the leaf interface remain unknown, preventing the understanding of their mode of action and their rational design.

Recent studies propose that fluids driven from the subducting plate contain either reduced or oxidized S species. These fluids rise through the overlying mantle to generate arc magmas; however, it is unclear how these fluids influence arc magma redox. We propose to use S and Fe XANES analysis of apatite and Fe-silicate minerals, respectively, in exhumed subduction zone rocks. These rocks underwent intense fluid-rock interaction at depths of >80 km. The S and Fe speciation in the minerals record the redox characteristics of the fluids: If these fluids contain oxidized S, the S and Fe in the rock will be oxidized as the fluid:rock ratio increases. From these data we can identify the S species carried in the fluids. Our results will be of major interest to the Earth Science community and have profound implications for the cycling of volatiles and their impact on Earth\u2019s climate and atmosphere.","958":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the application of highly-curved HAPG analyzer crystals in WD-XRF spectroscopy for the simultaneous analysis of lanthanides in unique extraterrestrial materials and explore its 3D voxel scanning capabilities at low excitation energies.

Sp-BCDI is based on modulating the coherent beam wavefront with a phase plate to produce a strongly non-uniform, \u201cspeckled\u201d illumination, that efficiently samples the 3D diffracted intensity around a Bragg peak. This reduces the data acquisition time (down to a few seconds) and enables the imaging of dynamically evolving crystals. We expect to observe the crystal morphology at various stages of dissolution. Exploiting the sensitivity of spBCDI to crystalline distortions we will correlate strain fields and defects to the morphological evolution of the corners and edges during the dissolution.

(Mg,Fe)SiO3 liquids will be investigated by XAS coupled to laser-driven dynamic compression on the HPLF platform on ID24-ED beamline.

The measured phonon density of states provides the Debye phonon average velocity (VD), which together with density and bulk modulus, determined by complementary X-ray diffraction measurements, are the necessary parameters for calculating the compressional velocity (VP) and shear velocity (VS) of the material. Our measurements will allow refining the carbon required to explain the observed seismic profile of the Earth\u2019s core.","964":"Ferropericlase (Fp) and bridgmanite (Brg) are the dominant minerals of the Earth\u2019s lower mantle. Recent discoveries on the deep-water cycle demonstrate that water can be delivered to the deepest portions of the lower mantle. Even though Fp and Brg have been intensively investigated over the last decades, our current knowledge on high-pressure (HP)-high-temperature (HT) reactions of Fp and Brg with water is very limited. In order to provide a comprehensive picture on Fp-H2O and Brg-H2O interactions at HP-HT conditions of the lower mantle, we propose to continue our multi-methodological studies employing both in situ powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and in situ Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (SMS) at pressures above 70 GPa.","965":"Pressures and temperatures in extraterrestrial rocky planets can reach up to 4 TPa and up to 9000 K, conditions that are hardly accessible with current experimental methods. This limitation leads to the problem of finding appropriate proxy compounds for high-pressure minerals. Therefore the ultimate goal of this proposal is reveal the role of iron oxides as structural prototypes for high-pressure silicates at pressure up to 200 GPa and temperatures up to 3000 K. We are going to synthesize iron silicates at these conditions, determine their crystal structure and compressional behavior,  and characterize the oxidation and spin state of iron atoms.  ","966":"Although calcium carbonate (CaCO3) has been the most studied mineral in geochemistry, its nucleation pathway has never been structurally resolved directly in an aqueous environment due to its relatively low solubility. The effects of external parameters, such as the addition of organic molecules, on its structural evolution during nucleation remain even more elusive. Consequently, before attempting to understand the effect of additives on CaCO3 nucleation, we need to ensure a sufficient understanding of the system by itself. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the nucleation pathway of CaCO3 by a new experimental approach that allows probing the nanostructural evolution of very diluted systems. In addition, we will investigate the influence of additives on the nucleation of CaCO3. Our method is based on a specific data collection strategy for diluted solutions during in situ time resolved high energy X-ray scattering (HEXS) in combination with a titration set-up. ","967":"In this project we will evaluate the oxidation state of Ce in zeolites exploited as cation exchangers for the recovery of REEs from leaching liquors.\r\nThe knowledge of Ce oxidation state is a key factor in the determination of the cation exchange capacity of the selected zeolite. The evaluation of this parameters is also fundamental for a correct interpretation of the cation exchange dynamic.\r\n\r\n","968":"Toxicity\/carcinogenicity of Fe-bearing mineral fibers is driven by the structural, coordinative, and oxidative states of the Fe sites on the fibers\u2019 surface, which is the actual interface between the fibers and the biological tissues. However, the specific conditions that make Fe sites able to induce free radical generation are not clear yet. To investigate this matter, we propose to perform total reflection X-ray absorption spectroscopy on tremolite asbestos, with the aim to unravel the surface state of the Fe sites and compare it with their bulk counterpart. The result will complement previous bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements in model systems (LS3052) and nano-X-ray diffraction measurements on single asbestos fibers (LS3009) performed during round 4\/2021.","969":"Niobium (Nb) is recognized as one of the so-called \u2018critical minerals\u2019, with wide applications in superalloys and superconductors but limited supply chain. An understanding of the speciation and solubility of Nb in hydrothermal solutions is key in helping both Nb exploration and mineral processing. High-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can reveal fine features of the XANES spectra, thus help identifying important Nb aqueous complexes (with O, F and Cl) that are hard to identify using conventional XAS detection techniques. This study plans to measure the coordination structure and solubility of Nb in hydrothermal fluoride, chloride and carbonate solutions at up to 500 \u00b0C and 800 bar to better understand the transport and deposition properties of Nb and its fractionation from its geochemical twin tantalum (Ta) in hydrothermal systems. This will complement our recent experiment on hydrothermal speciation of Ta.","970":"Uranium speciation controls its reactivity and transport in natural settings and is strongly modulated by redox fluctuations, but how its speciation varies in reducing marine environments and its significance for U sequestration processes in these settings remains unknown. The redox-sensitive behavior of uranium and its isotopic composition has emerged as a promising proxy to reconstruct the redox state of the oceans through Earth\u2019s history, but interpretation of uranium concentration and isotope ratio records is based on poorly constrained assumptions of the phases and burial pathways of reduced uranium. To investigate the processes that control U redox in marine sediments that ultimately are recorded in sedimentary rocks, we propose to determine the U distribution at \u00b5m-scale resolution and characterize its speciation using HERFD-XANES within well-characterized organic carbon-rich fine-grained rocks (shales) that were deposited in a range of reducing marine environments. \r\n\r\n","971":"During fossilization, the skeleton undergoes numerous chemical modifications: the mineral fraction, bio-apatite, is modified by the inclusion of exogenous elements. Consequently, fossilized bio-apatites are made up with elements acquired de vivo and elements acquired post-mortem. While the geochemistry of de vivo elements represents powerful tool to make paleo-inferences, elements acquired during the fossilization obliterate these pristine records. Thus, this proposal aims to analyze the elemental distribution of de vivo and principally acquired post-mortem elements using \u00b5-SXRF mapping. Then, coupled XANES and EXAFS of both Sr and Y K-edges, which are respectively proxies for de vivo and post-mortem elements will be performed on contrasted areas to fathom their speciation. Such information will improve our understanding of bio-apatite fossilization and present an integrative methodology to assess the degree of preservation of de vivo elements in bio-apatite in various samples.","972":"Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton that take up CO2 during photosynthesis. Therefore, Fe bioavailability and the pathways of supply to and removal from the ocean are of great scientific interest. Iron supply by hydrothermal vents is a potentially important but poorly constrained source of Fe to the deep sea. In order to understand the role of hydrothermal vents in the global marine iron (Fe) cycle, we need to determine the mechanisms of Fe precipitation, settling and burial around hydrothermal vents. We will apply Fe K-edge EXAFS to nanoscale Fe-rich aggregates in the water column and sedimentary Fe around a mid-Atlantic hydrothermal vent field ('Rainbow') and thus track the precipitation and diagenesis of hydrothermal Fe. XAS results from this unique dataset will provide, for the first time, insight into the long-term fate of hydrothermal nanoparticulate Fe aggregates beyond what have so far obtained from microscopic and chemical analyses.","973":"The goal of this project is to evaluate redox conditions and trends in subducted oceanic crust by determining compositions of zoned, transition-metal-bearing minerals and evaluating the results as a function of P-T conditions. This study will track element budgets in metamorphic minerals, particularly those that are sources and sinks of Fe3+ by determining the Fe oxidation state with Fe K-edge Micro-XANES. It will extend the database on the role of Fe oxidation state in metamorphic reactions, which is a pre-requisite for developing thermodynamic models that will eventually allow tracing the evolution of redox conditions from the subducted oceanic crust to the mantle melts in subduction-related volcanism.","974":"This project aims to improve our knowledge about the molybdenum speciation in hydrothermal fluids responsible for ore deposit formation. These new data will be obtained using in-situ XAS to study the (hydrogen)molybdate ion pairing with sodium and silicon and coupled with thermodynamic models, to determine their stability and solubility in aqueous fluids under a wide range of temperatures, pressures, pH, and fO2. The results obtained in this proposal are indispensable for the rigorous interpretation and valorization of our previous XAS measurements at BM30 (ES1050).","975":"We propose to measure the acoustic velocity of Ti- and\/or Al-bearing calcium perovskite (capv), the 3rd most abundant mineral in the lower mantle. The two published studies of capv\u2019s elastic properties have a significantly different temperature dependence, and both diverge significantly from computational results. Our previous work was one of these, reporting vp and vs of capv to ~ 13 GPa & 1500 K on ID06-LVP (see ES-464 and ES-636 reports). We now propose to extend this study, to determine the thermo-elastic properties of capv at pressures extending to 30-35 GPa. Data will overlap conditions of previous work to remeasure temperature derivatives as well as clarifying the pressure dependance of capv\u2019s thermo-elastic properties for more reliable extrapolation to the deep lower mantle. This will contribute directly to the interpretation of lower mantle seismic heterogeneities, and provide a mechanism for fingerprinting recycled material throughout Earth\u2019s mantle.","976":"Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, hosts a complex chemical engine that produces a rich inventory of organic molecules in its thick atmosphere and on its surface. Major organic species, such as benzene:acetonitrile, are expected to form at the surface of Titan  molecular co-crystal structures stable at the low surface temperatures (89-94K).\r\nWe propose to conduct X-ray diffraction experiments (powder and single crystal) on the benzene:acetonitrile (3:1) co-crystal down to 100 K and up to 1 GPa. This should permit us to obtain the first measurement of the stability with pressure that will be essential to conduct further experimental and theoretical studies. We expect these results to have a major impact on the planetary science community, specifically in the context of the upcoming NASA Dragonfly mission to Titan, that might be able to detect the presence of these phases in situ, once their properties are well-characterized with state-of-the-art experimental techniques on Earth.","977":"The aim of this proposal is to understand how xenon (Xe), a key tracer of terrestrial and atmosphere formation, is recycled at depth through subduction processes. Xenon isotopes in mantle fluids indeed show that atmospheric Xe is recycled at depth via subduction, with a larger contribution to the mantle Xe budget than in the case of Ar, and potentially essentially carried in phyllosilicates due to their cage and layered structures along with water and other major volatile elements. However, there are very few data available to document this hypothesis in the case of Xe, and no crystallographic data at all. We therefore plan to elucidate Xe retention mechanism(s) in antigorite, the high pressure (P) form of serpentine and main carrier of water back into the mantle. For this, we need to collect high quality powder diffraction data  in situ within antigorite stability field, and beyond in temperature (T) to probe Xe behavior upon antigorite breakdown and water release.","978":"Despite of more than 50 years of studying geologically relevant materials under high pressures and high temperatures major questions about the Earth\u2019s interior are remaining. While the structures of the main constituting crystalline phases of the Earth\u2019s crust and mantle have mostly been identified, the structures of geologically relevant melts and liquids at high pressures and temperatures are still not very well understood.\r\nWe propose to utilize the extreme brightness of the upgraded ESRF in combination with Soller slits and diamond anvil cells to obtain the total scattering of silicate glasses in the MgO-FeO-SiO2 system, as analogue for silicate melts, at extreme conditions. We expect to significantly extend the Q-range of those difficult measurements using non-monochromatized beam at 60 keV, which will result in much better resolution in real space pair distribution function. Thus, lead finally being able to study more complex glasses than previously possible\r\n","979":"We propose that the water in deep Earth can provide an abundant source of H2 and O2, which may drive the self-redox reaction of FeCO3 to form appreciable hydrocarbons and O2-bearing phases in the mantle. The former may become the basic nutrient for the evolution of life when these hydrocarbons migrate to the shallow crust, and the latter will fix O2 in the deep Earth and contribute to the redox-inhomogeneous mantle. Our study aims to address a longstanding knowledge gap regarding the redox mechanism(s) in the Fe-C-H-O system up to 90 GPa, 2500 K. The results from this study are expected to quantify structures of CO4-bearing carbonates in the deep lower mantle and the nature of coupled Fe-C-H-O redox reactions. This is of major interest to the broader Earth Science community, including those studying the physicochemical properties of CO4 tetrahedra in carbonates, the genesis of deep hydrocarbons, and the cycling of volatiles and their impact on Earth\u2019s climate and atmosphere.","980":"We will  study the nature of phase transition (PT) in a mineral called hemimorphite - Zn4(Si2O7)(OH)2xH2O under pressure, which crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system. It exhibits PT from Imm2 to Pnn2 between ca. 2.6-3.1 GPa. We want to study this PT at the level of quantitative redistribution of experimental electron density and quantitatively characterize how atoms\/ions exchange electron density under pressure, how existing interatomic interactions are weakened and new interactions are unset. To achieve our aims,  we will apply  the X-ray  beam with at least ca. 50keV (or higher), wide opening diamond anvil cell (for exampl.:  Diacell120 and our membrane 90o opening angle cell or use the cells which are available at ESRF. We will use 2-3 pieces of crystals inside DAC, and collect 100% (or close to 100%) completeness up to the resolution close to 0.4 (or better) \u00c5. Then will refine  multipole model of electron density against experimental variable pressure X-ray data. ","981":"The origin of tetrapods (land vertebrates) during the Devonian period was a key event in the evolution of the global ecosystem and in our own ancestry, but their early history is still poorly understood. This is seen clearly in the case of the end-Devonian mass extinction, the first major extinction event after the origin of tetrapods: land plants and non-marine fishes were devastated, and tetrapods may also have been severely impacted - but nobody knows. The reason is that there has been, until now, only a single tetrapod fossil locality with a single tetrapod (Tulerpeton) from the time immediately before the extinction event. During July-August 2022 I led an ERC-funded expedition to Greenland which collected the first extensive tetrapod fauna from the latest Devonian: at least 4-5 taxa represented by well-preserved 3D fossils. I now seek beam time on BM18 to image the most important specimens. The results will revolutionise our understanding of early tetrapod evolution.","982":"Polychelidan lobsters are decapod crustaceans that used to be abundant until Late Jurassic in many environments and are now restricted to deep-sea environment. Fossil specimens found in La Voulte-sur-Rh\u00f4ne (Callovian, 165 Ma) are often preserved in nodules and preserve organs that can be studied almost as well as on fresh species. The goal of this project is to study how their anatomy compares to their extant relatives and other crustaceans to assess the impact of 165 Ma of evolution and an environmental shift on organs morphology, as well as to provide new characters to place polychelidans within decapod crustaceans, their phylogenetic position still being a matter of debates.","983":"Ray-finned fishes (actinopterygians) today account for over half of all living vertebrates, and their origins date back over 300 million years. With over 30,000 species, they represent the largest vertebrate group and encompass everything from goldfish to seahorses and tuna to sunfish. Ray-finned fishes display an array of morphological innovations, key among which are features of the brain. There are several challenges to understanding how\u2014and when\u2014these innovations evolved, not least that living ray-finned fishes are evolutionarily remote from their early ancestors, and soft tissue structures rarely fossilise. Propagation phase contrast synchrotron X-ray \u03bcCT of 319-million-year fossil fish that exceptionally preserve neural tissues within the skull \u2013 such as the brain and cranial nerves \u2013 will open a window into brain evolution early in the group\u2019s history. The findings from this work will clarify patterns of evolution and innovation outside of the living group.","984":"Wormholes, intricate finger-like channels, may form fluid flows through soluble porous media. An example of such instability is a acidic water flow through porous rocks leading to formation of karst. In experimental setups such conditions are analyzed using rock cores injected with acid. A variety of flow and acid conditions lead to varying wormhole geometry, with well known links between them for single phase flows. When a second, non-wetting phase is added, new geometrical and time scales are introduced to the system changing its dynamical properties.\r\n\r\nHowever, studies reveal contradictory effects of the second phase on wormholes depending on the type of second phase and how it arises. These contradictory effects can be resolved by observation of the dynamics of the second phase in the rock\/wormhole. Injecting acid and nitrogen into a rock core to form wormholes while being scanned would allow to observe how steady state multi-phase flow interacts and changes wormhole dynamics.","985":"Sea spray icing on ships and offshore structures is a major safety concern for operations in polar regions. For its prediction and prevention, the largely unknown microstructure of the saline ice plays a central role, in particular the distribution and morphology of brine (unfrozen saline solution) pore networks and inclusions. Brine coexists in thermodynamic equilibrium with ice, making this microstructure very sensitive to changes in temperature. To study the spatio-temporal evolution of the brine pore space, we plan time-lapse phase contrast tomography and hierarchical scanning of saline spray ice. The results will be relevant for concise modeling of marine icing, ice adhesion, and a broader field of sea ice research topics.","986":"We aim to generate a baseline fundamental description of high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants, with a particular emphasis on particle shape and porosity evolution during sintering and recrystallization. In situ phase contrast microtomography is applied here up to 1300 \u00b0C. Samples consist of metal-oxides and mineral composites in grain size and chemical concentrations according to returned Apollo specimens, enhanced with glassy impact melt and agglutinated material (sintering agents) not yet widely present in available simulants for technology verification studies. Heating is seen as the dominant modification process in all processing of regolith: 3D printed constructions, separation of oxygen and metal, and the extraction of volatiles are application areas to be developed. ","987":"Nannoconus are a group of calcareous nannofossils (um size) produced by marine planktonic organisms that were important calcifiers during the Cretaceous. They represent an important group due to their successful development and the high calcification rate, which contributed to buffer the acidification of the oceans in the Early Cretaceous. Despite their abundance for a long time, nothing is known about both the mode of calcification and the chemical composition of Nannoconus exoskeleton. These informations are needed to explain their success as marine calcifiers in changing lower Cretaceous climate and oceans, and to decipher the paleochemistry of the oceans. In particular, determining metal (Sr, Mg) contents in their calcite plates can help solving these questions. Here, we propose to reconstruct the chemical composition of three families of nannofossils abundant in the Early Cretaceous by using X-ray micro-fluorescence spectroscopy (\u00b5-XRF) with synchrotron radiation at ESRF (ID21). ","988":"Mineral-organic associations (MOAs) store > 90% of soil carbon (C), protecting C from microbial decomposition for millennia. However, although plant exudates can disrupt MOAs and expose C protected therein to microbial decomposition, the extent of this disruption is unknown. Our goal is to assess how root exudation disrupts MOAs within the rhizosphere. We are propose to use ID21 to characterize the transformations of MOA within distinct rhizosphere microenvironments: the root tip, as well as elongation and differentiation zones. We plan to use XRF imaging in conjunction with Fe XANES\/EXAFS to assess the disruption of synthetic MOAs by quantifying changes in Fe phase contribution and abundance within distinct rhizosphere microenvironments. To manipulate the composition of root exudates, we will be using a unique biological tool \u2013 controlled infection with plant virus. We will the extent of MOA disruption within microsites along infected and uninfected plant roots.  ","989":"Gypsum stromatolites(GS) make excellent paradigms for the investigation of fine-scale mineral-microbial interactions and for the detection of Life remnants in gypsiferous deposits of Earth and Mars. In this framework and in light of NASA and ESA space missions targeting past traces of Life on Mars, we are studying the geomicrobiology of living and fossil GS from a terrestrial Martian analogue-site at the drylands of Ethiopia (Bakili Lake, Danakil Depression). To map the distribution and characterize the chemical content and structure of micro-\/nano-sized inorganic and organic biosignatures preserved in GS we will use SXM combined with multi-elemental \u03bcXRF 2D mapping and micro-spectroscopy, i.e., S & P K-edge \u03bcXANES, utilizing the unique technical capabilities of the upgraded ID21. Given no such experiments have been previously performed in gypsiferous sediments, we aspire that these results will provide new insights on biosignatures detection in the evaporitic record of Earth & Mars.","990":"Our aim is to obtain information about oxygen fugacity and an oxybarometric estimation of the residual silicate melt in Melt Inclusions (MI), hosted by K-feldspar crystals. This will be achieved through the study of valence and coordination of Ti, Fe and Mn atoms by collecting XAS data at Ti, Fe and Mn K-edges. The type of MI in the samples represents the naturally quenched glass, which denote the pre-eruptive melt conditions, or, from a geochemical point of view, the maximum degree of evolution of the magma reservoir. The obtained information will be coupled with FTIR analyses, to obtain the CO2 + H2O content in the glass (residual silicate melt) and with EPMA-WDS measurements, to compare the distribution of major elements within the geochemical dataset of MI. This set of information will allow the understanding of the oxidative degree of the magma volcanic system and will be contextualized in the wider framework of the evolution of the magmatic system of Mount Amiata volcano.\r\n","991":"Seasonal waterlogging and\/or drying of Arctic peat soils commonly results in leaching of reduced iron [Fe(II)] and organic carbon (OC). These natural iron organic carbon (Fe-OC) flocs contain OC and phosphorus species with high bioavailability, which are critical for primary productivity as these flocs are delivered into Arctic oceans. We request 12 shifts of beamtime at ID21 to produce spatially resolved P and Fe K-edge \u00b5-XANES maps of Fe-OC flocs that were collected along a 30-km transect of a peat-draining river in South Iceland. Our aim is to determine changes in structure, distribution and chemical speciation of phosphorus and iron in these Fe-OC flocs that occur during their transport via rivers from peatlands to marine environments. Our results will allow us to determine the contribution and role of such Fe-OC flocs in P and Fe cycling in Arctic environments.","992":"Crops worldwide have been affected by zinc deficiency. New Zn-Nanomaterials are needed to facilitate a timed and targeted delivery promoting the uptake through the plant rhizosphere and its distribution at the cellular and subcellular level 1,2.\r\nIn this study we focus on the impact of variable nanoparticles (NPs) surface chemistry and properties (ZnO NPs and surface modified ZnO NPs with Zn3(PO4)2) for Zn root uptake, transport, and distribution in pepper plants. Our preliminary results showed that roots exposed to the two NPs accumulates differently in roots, translocates, and accumulates differently in upper (6th\/7th) leaves. We hypothesize that the two NPs types move differently through the root epidermis and transports differently to upper leaves. \r\nWe propose to analyze roots and upper leaf tissue at different times of exposure, map the subcellular distribution and speciation of Zn, to better understand the mechanisms of uptake, translocation, and transformation inside the plant","993":"Nanocarriers (NC) can provide highly efficient agrochemical delivery, potentially transforming the way that we deliver nutrients to crops. However, relating NC design to the ability to target active agents to specific locations in the plants is needed to realize this goal. Plant protoplasts (plant cells without their cell walls) are the primary cell compartments in plant leaves where nutrients and active agents are needed. This study proposes to use synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging and spot XANES to determine how NC surface chemistry can influence their capacity to cross lipid membranes. We hypothesize that the surface chemistry of layered double hydroxide NCs (amine, arginine, histidine, PEG, OH) will enable NC targeting and delivery onto or into protoplasts. XRF imaging will be used to determine if NCs are outside, inside, and\/or associated with specific organelles of the protoplast. \u00b5-XANES are used to ensure that the NCs are being imaged rather than the metal tracer.\r\n","994":"This work investigates the application of highly-curved HAPG analyzer crystals in wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for the simultaneous analysis of lanthanides in unique extraterrestrial materials and explore its 3D voxel scanning capabilities at low excitation energies.

To advance the field, we propose to determine how light (LREE = Ce-Nd), medium (MREE = Gd-Dy), and heavy (HREE = Er-Yb) REE are incorporated in apatite-rich sediments at the atomic scale. The structural results will inform atomistic calculations that will be employed to model the thermodynamics and kinetics of the chemical reactions at the seawater-apatite interface.

Interpretation of the shell\u2019s isotopic and trace elemental composition provides a window into environmental conditions in the geological past, although a mechanistic understanding of how these signals are recorded in the biomineral is lacking. To better constrain both biomineralisation and alteration processes during fossilisation, we will conduct high-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses to investigate the distribution of organic matter in the shell, and hence its relevance at the biomineralisation site and during taphonomic processes. By contributing to the understanding of foraminifer biomineralisation, these insights will provide crucial information to understand the reliability of the large number of geochemical tools that are based on the shells of these organisms.","999":"While microbial activity might have a potentially dramatic impact towards silicate reactivity and CO2 sequestration in basalts, the magnitude of this impact remains unknown. Here we propose to investigate the impact of Pyrobaculum aerophilum, an Fe-reducing archeal strain recently identified from basaltic geothermal aquifers in Iceland, on the dissolution kinetics of basaltic glass, taken as a simplified model relevant for basaltic environments. This proposal will take advantage of the unique capability of the HP\/HT autoclave available on the FAME beamline to monitor the release and speciation of Fe in the aqueous phase in situ, which we previously successfully used to investigate the dissolution kinetics of Fe-bearing minerals.

Ferrian brucite, (Mg0.8FeIII0.2)(OH)1.8O0.2, has recently been synthesized at 200 \u00b0C by hydrothermal alteration of ferroan brucite, (Mg0.8FeII0.2)(OH)2, a mineral found in serpentinites. Ferrian brucite is isostructural to brucite with ferric iron replacing ferrous iron in octahedral position, charged balance by H vacancies. Indeed synthetic brucite (ferroan and ferrian) is prone to oxidation and carbonation in air what renders sample post-mortem characterization unreliable. For this purpose, we propose to use the resistively heated diamond anvil cell (RH-DAC) set-up developed at BM23, which was successfully used in our previous works for the study of ferrous \u2013 ferric iron mineral transformation.","1003":"By comparing laboratory elasticity data with the seismic observations, constraints on the mineralogy, chemistry, and temperature of the mantle and core can\r\nbe obtained.

However, all existing measurements of its elastic properties are restricted to pressure and temperature conditions significantly below those of the mantle geotherm, with many made outside wadsleyite\u2019s stability field. We propose to experimentally measure the acoustic velocities of wadsleyite with compositions between Mg2SiO4 and (Mg0.7Fe0.3)2SiO4 at relevant mantle PT conditions using ultrasonic interferometry in the multi-anvil press. When combined with synchrotron X-ray source, it\u2019s possible to accurately determine the pressure, density and length of the sample, therefore allow precise sound wave velocities to be obtained.","1004":"Reconstructing redox conditions within the Earth\u2019s mantle is an essential step in understanding large-scale material and volatile cycles between the Earth's outer\r\nenvelopes and its deep interior.\r\n\r\nThe study is designed to test the reliability and accuracy of previous geobarometers and oxybarometers for a suite of model volatile-bearing peridotitic rocks at\r\nEarth\u2019s upper mantle conditions up to the transition zone.\r\n\r\nThe mantle rocks will be synthesized by the large volume press combined by in-situ XRD at ID06. The oxidation state of Fe in the mineral and melt phases of the\r\nsynthesized samples will be then determined by latest breakthroughs of the synchrotron Moessbauer spectroscopy at ID18.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of an internally-consistent cross calibration of previous oxybarometers will allow improvements in fundamental models used to predict the depth\r\nand redox conditions of natural peridotitic upper mantle lithologies, including peridotitic mineral inclusions in diamonds.","1005":"Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the mineralogy of aqueous systems remains vastly unexplored at high pressures and low temperatures, even for common solutes such as NaCl or MgSO4. Investigation of the crystallographic diversity of these systems is motivated by the upcoming exploration of icy ocean worlds of the outer solar system by ambitious space missions such as NASA Europa Clipper and ESA JUICE. Deeper understanding of aqueous systems at low-temperature high-pressure  can also provide fundamental thermodynamic knowledge applicable to cryobiology, organ and tissue preservation technologies [5].  Our group has identified several uncharacterized hydrate phases of common and relevant aqueous systems using a high throughput isochoric high pressure chamber. We intend to obtain in-situ single crystal X-Ray diffraction data on these new hydrate phases at high pressure and low temperatures  in order to refine their structures and determine their stability range.","1006":"Monosulfide solid solution (mss), nominally (Fe,Ni,Cu)S is considered the main sulfide phase in the upper mantle.\r\nPure FeS is known to have at least four HP\/HT polymorphs in the P-T range 0-10 GPa and 300-1000 K. It undergoes also an electronic spin transition at 6 GPa. Many efforts have been dedicated to investigate pure FeS system also at much more extreme conditions for the relevance that troilite have in mineralogy of planetary cores. Despite the petrological and geochemical interest of mss for upper mantle mineralogy, no experimental PVT data are available and its phase diagram is unknown. We propose to investigate mss in 0-10 GPa and 300-1100 K P-T range by single crystal diffraction to determine its compressibility; verify by anomaly in compressibility possible electronic transition; determine possible HP\/HT polymorphs. The results will be used to model thermodynamic properties, to understand phase relationship of sulphides in the Earth\u2019s upper mantle.","1007":"This proposal requests beam time for exploratory rheometry experiments on ultralow-viscosity, hydrous basanite magma.  This type of magma has only been rarely observed to erupt from volcanoes, however, the 2021-2022 eruption of basanite from Tajogaite on the island of La Palma (Castro and Feisel, 2022) marks the most recent and destructive event of its kind in Europe.  This project aims  to mesure the viscosity of hydrous basanite melts.  The data we obtain using X-Ray radiographic imaging will expand our understanding of the physical properties of magma ascending from the deep earth, enabling improved physical models of magmatic processes.\r\n\r\n","1008":"Physical properties of liquid silicates under extreme conditions are of first importance in geophysics, to constrain the early molten stage as well as to understand the seismic anomalies detected nowadays at the Earth's Core-Mantle Boundary.  It is however extremely challenging to measure accurate melt structure over 100 GPa, therefore the analogy with compressed glass is often used. \r\nThanks to the unique capabilities of ID27 High pressure beamline (Multichannel collimator and high brilliance pink beam), our group would like to measure precise structure factor of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 glass up to 250 GPa, to understand the effect of Fe on density and local structure of glass. This dataset will be finally compared with recent XRD data of laser shocked liquid silicates patterns recorded at LCLS, in order to assess analogy and differences betweeen liquid and amorphous silicates. ","1009":"In this experiment, we aim to investigate Fe-Si-H phase relations at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. The experimental results are significant for constraining the composition of the inner core of the Earth and other terrestrial planets. In addition, we plan to measure the thermal equation of state of Fe-Si-H-alloys to get the density and bulk modulus of the materials that are the necessary parameters for calculating sound velocities. Our measurements will allow the refinement of the amount of Si and H in the Earth\u2019s core.","1010":"We propose a sub-micron resolution X-ray computed tomography study of the fossil teeth and jaws of brasilodontid fossils from the Late Triassic of Brazil. Brasilodontids are the sister group to mammaliaforms (basal mammals) and inform on the evolution of traits that define mammals: endothermy (warm bloodedness), determinate growth (growth ceases after sexual maturity) and diphyodonty (only two sets of teeth). We will image growth structures in the teeth and jaws of brasilodontids to estimate their lifespan and growth patterns, as well as tooth replacement rates and patterns. These values will allow us to (1), estimate basal metabolic rate (BMR), post-natal growth rate and growth pattern in brasilodontids for the first time, critical to the debate on the evolution of endothermy; and (2) quantify dental replacement rates, crucial to understanding the acquisition of diphyodonty in mammaliaforms. This will provide vital data on the early evolution of key mammalian characters.","1011":"Experiment ES-1297, which was carried out on Beamline BM18 in February 2023, aimed to image a collection of previously unstudied tetrapod fossils from the Devonian of Greenland by propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography. It was highly successful for small to medium-sized specimens, with superb data capture including evidence of soft-tissue preservation, but the largest blocks (20-30 cm diameter) yielded poor image quality because the currently installed detector is not optimal for such pieces. This is unfortunate, because the largest blocks contain semi-articulated skeletons, critical for interpreting the individual bones in smaller blocks. A new detector with a larger field of view and and much better properties will soon be installed; at the invitation of the Local Contacts I am submitting this follow-up application for beamtime to scan the large blocks with the new detector, thus completing this landmark project.","1012":"The experiment consist in mapping the swelling and the spatial distribution of the phases (air, water, intact clay and swelled clay) in partially saturated clayey materials. Osmotic technique is used to control the saturation of the sample. The 100 mm3 sample made of Benthonite powder is confined in an Al cell immersed in a controlled concentration PEG solution. The final objective is twofold. First determine the porosity changes triggers by the clay swelling and compare to the theoretical models and the macroscopic mechanical experiments (focusing on the anisotropy and spatial heterogeneity of the swelling process). Second, perform diffusion simulations on the segmented images in order to compare the results with a large set of laboratory experiments performed during the last 3 years, showing orders of magnitude lower diffusion coefficient values for the partially saturated cases compared to the saturated case, and postulated to be the result of multi-scalar air-water heterogeneities","1013":"The experiment will build on a set of Arctic sea ice cores recently collected during the largest Arctic expedition in history (MOSAiC,\u2019Multidisciplinary drifting\r\nObservatory for the Study of Arctic Climate\u2019, October 2019-September 2020, http:\/\/www.mosaicexpedition.org). These cores contain important and still unraveled\r\ninformation about the sea ice properties during the MOSAiC drift. We aim for phase-contrast tomography and hierarchical scanning of several full sea ice cores\r\nfrom MOSAiC, exploring the unique possibility at BM18 to scan large sample volumes with locally high resolution. The experiment will set a benchmark in 3D\r\nimage quality of sea ice microstructure and produce an open source dataset be relevant for many polar research topics and groups within and outside the\r\nMOSAiC consortium.","1014":"Understanding the processes leading to fossilization is crucial in palaeontology and laboratory-based experiments are an effective approach to constrain their timing, controls and mechanisms. Experiments of arthropods pyritization, one of the main pathways of replication of organisms in the fossil record, were conducted. The goal of this proposal is to visualize in 3D both the organism decay and its preservation by pyrite precipitation, which has not been possible with laboratory-based X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Data will (i) bring clues to the debate on whether tissues influence pyrite precipitation, (ii) establish a precise sequence of character decay in Crustacean, and (iii) precise the kinetics and influence of environmental factors onto ongoing destructive and preservation processes.","1015":"Lepidosaurs are a diverse group that includes lizards, snakes and the tuatara, making up almost a third of all land vertebrate species today. Their fossil record extends back 245 million years, but the origins and early evolution of lepidosaurs remain obscure. Early fossils are rare, with disputed interpretations, in part due to a lack of good anatomical data for these tiny specimens embedded in rock matrix. We propose to use propagation phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography on beamline BM18 to visualise the type and only specimen of the important early species Megachirella wachtleri. Previous lab-based X-ray micro-CT yielded very incomplete and unclear visualization of its anatomy. Synchrotron tomography will provide complete knowledge of the specimen's anatomy, with potential to resolve disagreements about the affinities of Megachirella, and to clarify key uncertainties about the deep evolutionary divergences and anatomical transformations of early lepidosaurs.","1016":"The objective of the experiment is to determine the aging of Fe and Mn precipitates forming a coating on grains in rapid sand filters. Rapid sand filtration (RSF) is a widely used technology in drinking water purification to remove NH4+ , Fe2+ and Mn2+ via oxidative processes. It has been found that the removal performance of RSFs changes over the duration of implementation, in particular for Mn. Effective oxidation of Mn2+ in RSFs requires microbial and surface catalysis. More particularly, Mn-oxides formed by Mn2+ oxidation can be effective catalysts for Mn2+ oxidation. We hypothesize that aging and alteration of Mn precipitates, forming the reactive coating around sand grains, contribute to the subsequent decrease in Mn removal efficiency. To test the hypothesis, we will combine XRF and XAS analyses of coatings obtained from RSFs of different operation lifetime. ","1017":"Our purpose is to measure Ti, V, Cr and Fe valences in chromites in a set of olivine-rich primitive achondrite meteorites, namely brachinites and ungrouped achondrites with brachinite affinity, to obtain fO2 estimations. Spinel is a common accessory phase in terrestrial, lunar, martian and asteroidal ultramafic rocks. Moreover, being one of the first phases to crystallize from basaltic magmas and allowing the incorporation of many multivalent cations, it can provide insights on the pristine source composition and fO2 degree. Both brachinites and brachinite-like ungrouped achondrites represent oxidized meteorite groups and their genetic relationship remains still unknown. Although both groups share many similarities, textural and compositional features allow to infer about a different origin for their parent body(ies). A large and complete fO2 dataset could shed a new light on their genetic relationships and improve our knowledge about pristine parent body (ies) composition(s).","1018":"This project strives to investigate the onset of gel formation and aging of bentonite gel through XPCS measurements. Bentonite is a common material for structural and sealing applications in several geological applications. Bentonite has a large swelling ratio with reported expansion as much as 5-15 times its original volume. We intend to observe the dynamics of this swelling because of water intercalation into the layered structure, as a function of temperature and bentonite composition.","1019":"We aim to generate a baseline fundamental description of high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants, with a particular emphasis on the intra- and inter-granular phase and amorphous distribution during sintering and recrystallization. Samples consist of metal-oxides and mineral composites in grain size and chemical concentrations according to returned Apollo specimens, enhanced with glassy components not yet widely present in available simulants for technology verification studies. Heating is seen as the dominant modification process in all processing of regolith: 3D printed constructions, separation of oxygen and metal, and the extraction of volatiles are application areas to be developed. A systematic combinatorial approach employing both micro- and nano-beams is proposed to investigate glass and mineral distribution, skin-core properties and diffuse scattering of simulants of diverse genesis pre-sintered at intervals up to 1500 \u00b0C.","1020":"Our team has been selected by NASA to perform the SXRF analysis on material being brought back to Earth from asteroid Bennu in their OSIRIS-REx space mission during their official initial analysis stage. We are looking to reliably detect, record and quantify the distribution of medium to high-Z trace elements throughout the hydrous minerals, chondrules, CAIs and matrix of the Bennu sample(s) at high resolution and with low detection limits. ","1021":"Data on the electronic state and local environment of Fe as a function of pressure (P) are scarce because of experimental challenges of synthesising relevant compositions for the early Earth. This proposal aims to measure Fe in peridotitic glasses, synthesised under different oxygen fugacity (fO2), using X-ray Absorption spectroscopy up to 150 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. Using high resolution energy scans at the Fe K-edge, we will measure its pre-edge feature (i.e. redox, spin state), as well as the extended region above the edge (i.e. mean bond length). Combined with our recent high pressure M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, we will identify the different spin states of Fe in peridotitic glasses and establish a calibration for the absolute proportions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ therein, using the XANES method. Hence, we aim to determine the relative stabilities of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as a function of P, and whether the fO2 at the surface of a planet depends upon its mass, affecting the Earth\u2019 evolution. ","1022":"Serpentinization is considered as among the most important processes sustaining redox conditions suitable for the synthesis of natural H2 and abiotic CH4. This process is documented at mid ocean ridges but also occur in subduction zones. In the latter context the potential for serpentinization to generate natural H2 and abiotic CH4 is not well understood. Since the release of reduced fluids is guided by the oxidation of ferrous iron into ferric iron hosted in secondary minerals (mainly serpentine and magnetite), the definition of the Fe3+\/FeTot ratio in high-pressure serpentinites is fundamental to provide new insights on the magnitude of redox transformation and the related deep H2-CH4 formation in subduction zones. Here, we aim to determine the Fe3+\/FeTot concentration by looking at the Fe K-edge pre-edge feature in different arrays of minerals formed in ancient subduction zones, now exhumed to the surface.","1023":"Here, we propose to investigate the application of advanced x-ray spectroscopy techniques to the quantification of Fe speciation in basaltic silicate glasses--the primary method by which the oxidation state of magmas is determined from natural glasses. We will collect Fe K-edge K\u03b2 mainline HERFD and K\u03b21,3 XES of the Berry et al. (2018) suite of synthetic basaltic glasses previously characterised by conventional PFY XANES and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. Via the HERFD dataset we can evaluate the increase in sensitivity, and reduced influence of main edge background on the pre-edge feature employed for Fe species quantification. This may reveal K\u03b2 mainline HERFD as a superior method permitting direct comparison between datasets due to reduced sensitivity to background subtraction. The XES dataset will permit assessment of the technique as an alternative method with potential application employing laboratory-based instruments.","1024":"The aim of this proposal is to reveal the role of Mg on the degree of solubility of Si in (Fe,Mg)-oxides at high-pressure high-temperature conditions. We will study the chemical reactivity between (Fe,Mg)-oxides and SiO2 at pressures up to 200 GPa and temperatures up to 3000 K by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Moessbauer spectroscopy. ","1025":"Pressure solution creep (PSC) is a major deformation mechanism in the Earth\u2019s upper crust that constrains geophysical processes and the performance of\r\nhydrogen and CO2 storage reservoirs. PSC occurs in fluid-saturated granular media (e.g., halite, calcite, or quartz grains) through dissolution of minerals at\r\nparticle contacts, transport of minerals through fluid-filled pores, and deposition of minerals onto grain surfaces. Despite extensive study, many uncertainties\r\npersist regarding the appropriate relationships between local stresses, local dissolution\/precipitation rates and global creep rates. The purpose of the proposed\r\nwork is to provide the first simultaneous measurements of contact-scale stresses driving dissolution, grain-scale shape changes resulting from precipitation, and\r\nsample-scale creep rates during the PSC process in small packings of halite grains by using x-ray tomography (XRT), 3D x-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and scanning\r\n3DXRD (s3DXRD).","1026":"The aim of this experiment is to investigate, in a non-destructive manner, the rare-earth element (REE) abundance and obtained concentration trends (e.g. light REE vs high REE, REE anomalies) in intense aqueously altered and fluid-rich regions found inside unique samples of the Winchcombe and Northwest Africa 6693 meteorites. These Ca, P-rich regions of interest correspond to the calcium phosphate minerals apatite and merrillite, which contain trace amounts (1-10 ppm) of REEs like Y and the lanthanide series (La-Lu). Quantified REE values normalised to early Solar System abundances reveal concentration trends which hint at which stage fluids started to mobilise on the water-rich parent bodies of these meteorites.","1027":"Ice in glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost plays a crucial role in climate, sea-level, and scientific research. Recent discoveries have revealed the potential for various organic molecules to become trapped in ice, leading to unique chemical reactions and environmental processes. This study leverages our expertise in incorporating amino acids and proteins into inorganic crystals to investigate the integration of four amino acids and an antifreeze protein into ice. Employing a cryostat, we will freeze water solutions with varying organic molecule concentrations, assessing lattice distortions on ID22 to unveil incorporation extent and locations. Under different undercooling conditions, we will explore kinetic impacts on incorporation and lattice strains. Further, a DSC will be used to assesses the effect of organic molecule concentrations on water's freezing point. Our research promises insights into these interactions, advancing fundamental processes across scientific disciplines.","1028":"Antimony (Sb) is a critical metal commodity and an indicator for the formation of some of the largest hydrothermal gold (Au) deposits. However, the conditions of extraction of Sb from granitic magmas and its transport by magmatic volatiles remains poorly understood. Here we will determine the partition coefficients of Sb between granitic melts and Cl\/S-bearing aqueous fluids and its speciation to provide new insight into the formation of Sb(Au) deposits. Fluid-melt partitioning and speciation experiments will be performed in the FAME autoclave in conjunction with synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (SXRF) and absorption (HERFD-XAS) spectroscopy analysis at BM16.","1029":"The Baltic Sea is largely anoxic and sulfidic at depth but periodically oxygenated by the inflow of oxic seawater from the North Sea. This present an ideal natural laboratory to develop the application of the uranium (U) and vanadium (V) \u2018paleoredox proxies\u2019, which rely on interpreting the abundance and isotopic composition of these redox-sensitive metals. Although these are key tools for redox reconstructions in ancient oceans, basic uncertainties remain regarding the application of paleoredox proxies such as the oxidation state and coordination environment of these metals. This will be addressed in this proposal by determiningy the distribution and speciation of U and V in anaerobically preserved Baltic Sea sediments using HERFD-XANES, EXAFS and XRF mapping techniques at the Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL-II). The combination of these data with elemental abundances and isotope compositions will offer unprecendeted insights into the application of the U and V paleoredox proxies. ","1030":"Experimental studies on high-pressure dolomite breakdown to aragonite + magnesite carried out over the last 20 years have shown discrepancies. As part of the sediment pile, high-pressure marbles are often present in ultra-high-pressure (UHP) terranes that experienced burial to more than 100 km in continent hypercollisions. Since this discovery the potential of carbonate minerals as UHP indicators has been outlined. Therefore, it is fundamental to elucidate this reaction, which has a >2 GPa uncertainty along the fast subduction pressure \u2013 temperature path that corresponds to UHP terranes. Here, we propose to bracket the dolomite breakdown reaction using materials that have been previously used for the studies that showed discrepant results. By combining in-situ phase diagram study and structural (ordering) study of the various dolomites, we will elucidate this reaction and to propose a robust guide to interpret high-pressure marble occurrence in continent hypercollision zones.","1031":"We propose conducting in-situ XRPD experiment to investigate the P-T stability and structure of CaSiO3 polymorphs and their destabilization phases in the P\/T range of 0-15 GPa and 300-1500 K, corresponding to Earth's upper mantle and transition zone. Existing research point to the intricate nature of the phase diagram of CaSiO3. It reveals the presence of apx. five distinct polymorphs characterized by tetrahedral silicon units, with stability observed up to approximately 8 GPa. Beyond, there is a transition to a mixture of Ca2SiO4 and CaSi2O5 phases, the crystal structures of which may still be undetermined. These phases hold significant importance as accessory components within the Earth's mantle and are frequently encountered as inclusions in diamonds. Reconstructing the precise phase diagram, including the crystal structures and the pressure-temperature stability ranges of each phase, will contribute to a more accurate understanding of the depths at which diamonds originate.","1032":"Hydrated tectonic plates sink into the Earth\u2019s mantle at subduction zones, leading to the deep transportation of \"water\" in minerals like serpentine to depths exceeding 250 km [~8 GPa]. Seismic studies revealed the presence of numerous low seismic velocity anomalies and large shear wave splitting times potentially related to serpentinites along and above subducting slabs. However, we currently lack any direct information on the influence of temperature as well as variable foliation on the elastic properties of natural serpentine. Our proposal aims to conduct in-situ acoustic measurements of compressional (Vp) and shear wave (Vs) velocities that precisely locate seismic anomalies in P and T space of powdered and variably foliated serpentinite by using state-of-the-art in situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with simultaneous ultrasonic interferometry and imaging at ID06-LVP, ESRF. ","1033":"We propose to measure the crystallographic properties of breyite (CaSiO3, previously known as walstromite), larnite (Ca2SiO4) and titanite (CaSi2O5) as a function of temperature from ~ 5-12 GPa. These three calcium-rich phases are commonly observed in diamond-hosted inclusions, and in this context are often believed to be the exhumation breakdown products of former calcium perovskite minerals. This hypothesis could be more rigorously tested if the structure and high PT equation of state (EoS) of these minerals were known, allowing entrapment conditions to be reliably estimated from observed remnant pressures. Our results will significantly enhance interpretations of the formation and exhumation history of superdeep diamonds and their inclusions.","1034":"To evaluate whether the observed seismic attenuation in the lower mantle is due to small-scale lamination (extrinsic attenuation) or by intrinsic dissipation in bridgmanite and ferropericlase, we plan to conduct cyclic loading experiments on neighborite (NaMgF3) in conjunction with synchrotron radiation. NaMgF3 is a ferroelastic perovskite isostructural to bridgmanite, both belong to the sub-space-group Pbnm of the cubic perovskite structure and exhibit extensive twinning. When the direction of the stress is reversed, the perovskites will de-twin or form new twin domains. Thus, a cycling stress field causes twin domain switching and produces stress-strain hysteresis loops whose enclosed area is a measure of dissipated elastic energy. With increasing temperature, the Pbnm lattice distortion decreases, making it easier for twin domains to switch. A similar process may influence intrinsic attenuation of seismic waves travelling through bridgmanite. ","1035":"The goal of this proposal is to produce high-quality equation of state (EOS) of core materials at inner core conditions. In order to produce reliable density measurements at high pressure and temperature, evaluation of different pressure scales is critical part of the measurement. Here we propose to critically evaluate the consistency of the Pt, Au, MgO, NaCl, W, and Re pressure scales up to at least 450 GPa at room temperature, and further examine the thermal pressure up to at least 365 GPa and 3500 K, using our newly optimized toroidal diamond anvils. The data will be evaluated in conjunction with recent dynamic compression data to terapascal pressure. We will then investigate the effect of Si and C on the EOS of iron and possible formation of new compounds up to 365 GPa and 3500 K.

Recent advances on the deep-water cycle demonstrate that water can be delivered to the deepest portions of the lower mantle, alternating its properties and mineralogy. Even though Ca-Pv have been intensively investigated over the last decades, our knowledge on fate of Ca-Pv in the presence of water is very limited, also due to the methodological limitations. In order to provide a comprehensive picture on Ca-Pv-H2O interactions at conditions of the lower mantle, we propose to perform in situ powder and single-crystal multi-grain X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) at pressures 30-120 GPa and temperatures 1500-2900 K.   ","1037":"We propose sub-micron resolution X-ray computed tomography of growth structures in the teeth and jaws of Mesozoic mammal fossils to establish the evolution of mammalian traits: elevated basal metabolic rate (BMR) and growth rate, and one phase of tooth replacement (diphyodonty). We will study fossil mammals from southern Australia including the earliest monotreme, and the globally distributed mammaliaform fossil Morganucodon. During the Cretaceous southern Australia sat within the Antarctic circle experiencing months of darkness and standing ice. We will test if the life histories (lifespan, BMR, growth rate, tooth replacement rate and pattern) of these unique polar mammals were significantly different to a) extant mammals, b) earlier stem mammals such as Morganucodon (with lower metabolic rates but diphyodont dentition). This study will provide valuable insight into the life histories of the earliest polar mammals and the macroevolution of mammalian physiology.  ","1038":"Olivine dissolution has drawn significant attention, especially for enhanced silicate weathering to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, several questions persist on olivine interaction with seawater, such as the effects of composition and secondary minerals on dissolution also impurities or inclusions which could affect marine biota. To address these critical issues, we propose an in-situ experiment to study olivine dissolution in seawater. We hypothesize that olivine dissolution also forms fractures which increase surface area. Yet, due to inadequate spatial resolution of laboratory XCT, identifying the fracture and essential dissolution features within these fractures was challenging. Thus, an advanced and precise approach is necessary to investigate the dissolution dynamics. This investigation at ESRF aims to determine dissolution rate and fracture propagation which offers crucial input to accurately simulate olivine dissolution and assessing potential risks to marine biota.","1039":"The origin of tetrapods and terrestrial locomotion involved the transformation of small pelvic fins into large weight-supporting hind limbs. The closest fossil relatives of tetrapods are the elpistostegalian fishes, large predators from the Devonian period that were probably capable of moving over land. However, while their pectoral fins already begin to resemble tetrapod forelimbs, the smaller and more fish-like pelvic fins are very poorly known. This hampers our understanding of their locomotion. A recent paid-for experiment, IN-1148, scanned part of the best-preserved elpistostegalian fossil (a complete Elpistostege watsoni, MHNM 06-2067) and revealed a unique pelvic fin anatomy: adapted to movement on land, but not tetrapod-like. We now seek beamtime for a complete scan of the whole pelvic region. This will greatly improve our understanding of elpistostegalian locomotion and the beginning of terrestriality.   ","1040":"We propose a propagation phase contrast synchrotron radiation X-ray micro computed tomography (PPC-SR\u00b5CT) study of an unreported Early Cretaceous mammaliaform fossil which is a new docodontan species. This fossil is superbly preserved with articulated cheek teeth and skeleton, and soft tissues including fur, whiskers, and claws. The best voxel size of mainslab\u2019s previous lab-based CT was 27 \u00b5m, which was not enough to identify the key morphological details. A recently acquired counterslab has yet to be CT scanned. With the requested PPC-SR\u00b5CT of 9 shifts on BM18, we will image the complete specimen from the two slabs separately, at a 10 \u00b5m voxel size, and acquire specific regions at a voxel size ca. 1 \u00b5m. The higher resolution scans will include teeth, middle ear, carpals and articulation, tibia tissues and possible gut content remains. The purpose is to restore the biology and lifestyle of this new docodontan, and further advance our understanding of the early evolution of mammals.","1041":"Crucial to the spectacular evolutionary success of modern birds is their uniquely efficient respiratory system. Dinosaur skeletons show that this system first appeared in fossil ancestors of birds. However, its earliest evolution is cryptic and poorly understood. We will break a current impasse by analysing the internal histology of bones of dinosaurs and their relatives, searching for a recently identified hard tissue that is correlated with the presence of this system. This tissue type is normally identified through destructively sampling fossils, limiting its use in rare and scientifically significant specimens. We aim to test whether synchrotron tomography is able to detect this bone tissue, which is composed of tiny asbestiform densely packed fibres of <60\u03bcm, providing a non-destructive way to study this tissue. Our work will reveal the early evolutionary history of bird respiration, answering key questions about the success of dinosaurs, birds and their kin.","1042":"Vertebrates dominate the vast majority of present day ecosystems, but have an obscure early history with the fossil record indicating the prevalence of jawless \u2018agnathans\u2019 for the first 50 million years of their evolution. The anatomy of these early jawless vertebrates, and in particular how they fed, is of great importance to understand the origins of modern vertebrates and the acquisition of evolutionary novelties such as the head. However, previous studies have largely been limited to observations of the surface of the fossils, including mechanical or acid preparations. The application of propagation phase contrast synchrotron X-ray \u03bcCT imaging of specimens from the Ordovician and Devonian will enable the evaluation some of the key proposals of the \u2018New Head\u2019 hypothesis and the subsequent evolution of jaws, with a particular focus on the development of the cranium and associated feeding mechanisms.","1043":"The Ediacara biota is an assemblage of soft-bodied, multicellular animals present as fossils in rocks from the Ediacaran Period (635-541 Ma). Nearly all are preserved as casts and moulds in course-grained siliciclastic rocks. The study of well-preserved specimens can help unravel their palaeobiology and provide keys to their relationships with modern taxa. Synchrotron microtomography offers a non-destructive method to study the remnants of important internal morphology present in Ediacara-type fossils from deposits in South Africa and Arctic Norway. Fossils from the Nama Group in the Northern Cape of South Africa and the Vestertana Group in Finnmark, northern Norway are important assemblages that have been relatively understudied. The specimens chosen for analysis represent the best preserved Ediacara-type fossils that have been found to date in both countries. We hypothesize that the internal features present in several of our specimens indicate affinities with early sponges.","1044":"Rock failure by dynamic unloading is a common mechanical process in the Earth\u2019s crust (earthquakes, underground rock mass excavation) but has been little studied experimentally due to technical challenges. We conceived new experiments deforming water-saturated rocks under virtually instantaneous decompression after being loaded at high pressures and temperatures. Preliminary lab-based X-ray CT suggest that the induced dynamic fracturing is positively correlated with the pressure drops but it is dramatically enhanced when the pore water vaporises\/degasses during decompression. Such phase transitions might play a big, so far neglected, role in sustaining the initial stages of dynamic fracturing in the crust. To assess the magnitude of these processes, it is vital to fully quantify the 3D fracture network of the experimental samples to submicrometric resolution through synchrotron-light X-ray microtomography. These unique data can help to close a current knowledge gap in rock mechanics.","1045":"Fluid flow in porous media plays a central role in environmental and industrial systems, with important consequences for reactive transport processes. We\r\nhave recently shown that steady laminar flows through transparent bead packs produce chaotic microscale trajectories, like turbulent flows but at low Reynolds\r\nnumbers. This fundamentally changes the current paradigm of reactive transport modeling as chaos enhances microscale chemical gradients and controls mixing\r\nrates. Yet, proving the existence of chaotic mixing in rocks, key for reservoir and storage applications, is an outstanding challenge. This proposal seeks beamtime\r\nto conduct the first experiments to evidence chaotic mixing in rocks, for which ESRF-ID19 is the only beamline allowing the required acquisition of fast, highly-\r\nresolved, and low-noise microscale solute gradient images. This new dataset will be transformative in the current understanding of a broad range of reactive\r\ntransport processes.","1046":"Imbibition of wetting liquids into porous media is a topic of great scientific interest due to its geological, environmental, biological, and daily life importance. Recent developments in X-ray techniques enable in situ imaging imbibition in 4D (3D + time). During imbibition, many rapid events take place at the interfaces between fluids and the solid matrix. Pore filling events happen rapidly in milliseconds, posing a challenge for real-time 3D monitoring. Consequently, 3D imaging has been mostly restricted to equilibrium states before and after the process. We propose to study a) forced and b) spontaneous imbibition of wetting phase fluid into porous media using our recently proposed stroboscopic method for non-destructive real-time 3D imaging of fast pore-scale events. These studies are scientifically valuable as they enable real time monitoring of fundamental imbibition dynamics at their native temporal and spatial scales, allowing proposed theoretical models to be challenged.","1047":"Conditions on the early Earth were hostile with intense UV radiation, but cells still managed to adapt and thrive. The evolution of new metabolic pathways is the obvious route by which cells coped with environmental pressures, however, the social lives of cells were just as important. Cooperation and sociality are the well- known mechanisms for dealing with environmental stress and the evolution of complexity, but how this played out in the earliest prokaryote groups is unknown. A palaeontological angle to this issue is almost entirely unexplored  and represents a huge gap in knowledge. We wish to address this gap, by examining the earliest fossilized evidence of  sociality in Archaean cellular microfossils. This study will document for the first time the \u201csociobiological aspects\u201d of the unusually large prokaryotes during the Archaean and provide clues related to their subsequent disappearance in the later history of the geological time till date.","1048":"Micrometeorites (MMs) are 4.5 billion years old dust size particles (<300 micrometers) derived from the comet-forming region. When they enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, MMs experience various degrees of heating that change their original texture and composition. Some remain intact while others are fully molten. Unmolten, pristine MMs provide a unique opportunity to directly study the most primitive material in the Solar System. However, distinguishing between pristine and molten MMs using standard petrological techniques partially consumes the material, which prevents further investigation to extract meaningful isotopic data. Thus, we propose to use X-ray nanotomography (nanoCT) on beamline ID16B to non-destructively obtain 3D petrological and textural characterization of a set of 15 MMs, enabling us, for the first time, to determine and compare their nucleosynthetic isotope composition with that of planets and asteroids to test Solar System formation models.","1049":"Foliar application of nanoparticles (NPs) on plants leaves has the potential to improve plant nutrition and protection. There are major gaps in our understanding of how hydrophobic interactions drive NPs foliar uptake, translocation, and transformation in plant leaves. Our preliminary data indicates that these hydrophobic interactions are a key driver to NPs association with plant cuticle. In this project we propose to study how hydrophobicity and cuticle composition influence NPs transfers and transformations on and in tomato leaves. To do this, we aim at studying the interactions between (i) tomato mutants (cuticle composition and thickness variation) and (ii) Cu-based NPs of various hydrophobicities. Cu-based NP distribution and chemical speciation changes on the surface and inside leaves will be studied. Unravelling the role of cuticle composition and thickness on hydrophobic nanoparticle uptake will be an important step towards developing safe and sustainable agrochemicals.","1050":"This study aims to enhance our understanding of the formation of high-grade porphyry copper deposits, urged by the growing global demand of copper to support a sustainable transition to green energy. The proposed experiment will focus on apatite, which is a mineral that has enormous potential in exploration targeting for porphyry copper deposits due to its unique ability to record and retain information that fingerprints magmatic and hydrothermal mineralising processes. We propose to conduct micro-X-ray absorption near-edge structures (\u00b5-XANES) spectroscopy at the S K-edge on natural and experimental apatite from two of the world\u2019s most significant high-grade porphyry copper deposits: La Escondida (Chile) and Resolution (Arizona, USA). Unveiling the sulfur speciation in apatite will provide crucial information about redox conditions prevailing throughout the evolution of magmas associated with high-grade copper mineralisation. ","1051":"The temperature and redox state of magmas are key to understand planetary evolution. The Moon formed via a giant impact onto the proto Earth that has allowed elevated temperature of magma production, of which a critical constraint is the high Ti contents of lunar zircons. Ti has two valance states, Ti3+ and Ti4+, and the retention of Ti in igneous zircons may be affected also by redox state. We have synthesized zircons, and found enhanced Ti solubility at reduced and low temperature conditions. One mechanism for the observation is that, under cool and reduced conditions, Ti3+ is present in appreciable amounts in the system and partitions more into zircon. We plan to test this idea by examining Ti3+ and Ti4+ in zircons from representative runs. The crystal sizes and Ti contents of the zircons require the analyses by synchrotron XANES. The results will be used along with our other trace-elements data in zircons to place new constraints on the thermal state of planetary magmas.","1052":"Degassing of sulfur from magmas causes explosive volcanism, the genesis of economically important copper deposits and atmospheric cycling of sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dissolved in ascending magmas transitions from S2- at the base of the crust to S6+ at the surface, however pinpointing the location and nature of this transition is challenging due to the lack of preservation of melt S valence state. This proposal aims to measure the valence state of S in apatite (which contains S2-, S4+ and S6+) in magmatic rocks from Famatina, Argentina by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the S K-edge to track the evolution of S in magmas with depth. Peak positions and areas will be fitted to quantify integrated S6+\/Stotal and infer melt S redox evolution. Identifying a shift from S2- to S6+ in the deep crust, may provide a mechanism by which metal-rich sulphides are recycled into ascending magmas, explaining the paradoxical occurrence of sulfur- and metal-rich magmas at Earth\u2019s surface.  ","1053":"The usage of Cu-based fungicides in agriculture is restricted in the EU (EU 2018\/1981) due to soil contamination. There is an urgent need to enhance the efficiency of the allowed Cu dosages. Cu-based nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) can be an efficient fungicide alternative. They present higher leaf affinity than ionic Cu, drastically reducing Cu wash-off and subsequent application dose and frequency. In a previous session at the ESRF, we assessed the Cu-NPs transformations and spatial distribution at the leaf surface and in the plant after uptake. However, fungal infections will likely modulate the leaf surface microenvironment (pH modification) due to pathogen metabolites released while colonizing the leaf, likely changing Cu speciation and distribution in the leaf. We aim to understand the pathogen's impact on the possible Cu-species transformation and subsequent changes in its spatial distribution along with the associated adhesion and translocation.","1054":"Our goal is to explore the initial nucleation and crystallization processes of volcanic melts. Initially, we will conduct SAXS-WAXS measurements on a set of nanocrystal-bearing glasses (approximately 5-100 nm in diameter) that we have thoroughly characterized through TEM imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility analyses. This glass characterization is crucial for accurately calibrating our SAXS-WAXS analysis. Subsequently, we will perform high-temperature SAXS-WAXS measurements, utilizing a heating stage near the glass transition temperature, to examine the initiation of crystallization in volcanic melts. Within the scope of our ERC NANOVOLC grant, this data will enable us to significantly enhance the precision of magma transport models, a fundamental factor in understanding and predicting the transition from effusive to explosive volcanic activity. This will be achieved by taking into account the temporal changes in viscosity caused by crystal formation.","1055":"Microbially influenced sedimentary rocks can provide valuable insights about the rise and evolution of life on Earth. Still, while mineral biosignatures are considered more resilient than organic ones, the challenge for their study relies on identifying and differentiating the biogenic features from structures generated by abiotic processes over time. This proposal aims to tackle this problem by the multiscale characterization of microbial biominerals within laminated microbialites. The relative orientation of nanostructures and crystal structure will be investigated using scanning SAXS\/WAXS, and the biogeochemical context obtained with simultaneous XRF mapping. Our request is 9 shifts on ID13, 17keV and 5 microns beam for simultaneous SAXS\/WAXS and XRF measurements. ","1056":"The isotopic composition of cadmium in the oceans (\u03b4114\/110Cd) has been proposed as a proxy for ancient nutrient utilization, primary productivity and global-scale marine organic carbon burial. The development of this proxy, however, is held back by not having a detailed understanding of how Cd is buried into marine sediments in association with different mineral phases, and how the distribution of Cd is altered during sediment diagenesis and burial. We seek to tackle this issue by quantifying the distribution and speciation of Cd in organic- and sulfur-rich marine sediments for the first time. The results will enable accurate interpretation of sedimentary Cd isotope signatures and ancient ocean chemistry. ","1057":"Terrestrial planets and exoplanets are thought to host deep magma oceans at least during their early accretion. The physical (e.g. density and transport properties) and chemical (e.g. redox state of Fe) properties of the dense Fe-bearing silicate melts which compose these magma oceans determine the subsequent evolution of the planet interior and the atmosphere composition.  However, experimental DAC studies of silicate liquids are difficult due to the chemical diffusion and ab initio simulations approaches are challenged by the complex chemical behaviour of Fe in oxide melts. This proposal aims at providing insights on Fe-bearing silicates' density and reactivity by measuring the local atomic structure around Fe atoms, and the oxidation and spin states of Fe at pressures relevant for large terrestrial planet interiors. In situ XAS measurements will be performed in shock compressed Fe-bearing silicates on the ID24-ED beamline coupled with the High-Power Laser Facility.","1058":"Over the last 20 years, rare earth elements (REE: La to Lu, +Sc, Y) have become of critical importance to the development of new technologies and transition to carbon-free energy. A detailed understanding of REE aqueous chemistry is key to modeling the processes that enable their concentration to economic level in the Earth\u2019s crust. Yet, current thermodynamic models only really on a scarce set of experimental data, mostly collected at T< 500C and P < 1kbar to describe REE aqueous transport and concentration. To tackle this issue, we propose to constrain the speciation of Nd and Yb in high P-T fluids conducting in-situ XAS analysis in RH-DAC. The obtained results will complete an experimental dataset developed for almost 10 years by the co-proposers and enable the development of more accurate depositional models for the REE.  ","1059":"Oxygen is believed to be one of the main light element alloyed with iron in the Earth's core. It is therefore crucial to constrain the liquid Fe-O alloys properties over pressure of 200 GPa. In this frame, the present proposal aims at using XANES and EXAFS diagnostics to constrain the local atomic arranegment, as well as the spin state of Fe as function of pressure temperature and O content. In addition, Plasma Vapor Deposited targets are more and more common for high repetition rate shock compression experiments. Better characterizing the use of PVD targets is crucial for the future of shock compression studies on large-scale X-ray facilities.","1060":"This follow-up proposal focuses on the characterization of the nature of phase transitions in FeHx compounds (with x = 6 or higher) beyond 230 GPa, that have yet been only predicted theoretically. It also aims to provide insights in the pressure-induced rearrangements of local electronic and atomic structures in these compounds that remain highly controversial. In our recent experiment (ES-1247), we could successfully reproduce the formation of known FeH\/FeH2\/FeH3\/FeH5 compounds and characterized their local atomic and electronic arrangements from XANES and EXAFS measurements combined with XRD to 230 GPa. At the highest pressure, our data strongly indicate a phase transition potentially to a higher stoichiometry FeHx compound with x = 6. Here, we propose to extend our measurements using our established protocol to explore the formation and local atomic and electronic structure of this new compound. Also, we plan to extend our XAS study of Fe up to the 500 GPa range.","1061":"We will extend our study on the pressure and temperature induced structural changes around Sr and Y contained silicate melts and glasses relevant to magmatic processes in the deep Earth. We plan to extend our previous work on simplified glass compositions. In this follow-up, we will focus on the naturally most relevant basaltic composition. We will investigate in-situ at high P\/T conditions of the Earth\u2019s mantle the local structural environment of these cations, both in the glass and in the melt using a laser heated diamond anvil cell combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These data will allow identifying effects of pressure-induced structural changes of the main silicate network onto the coordination of these cations that represent geochemically important trace elements as well as network-modifying cations. These data will provide unprecedented insights on the structural interplay between network-forming and NM-elements of melts throughout Earth\u2019s mantle conditions.","1062":"In this study we propose to use the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (SMS) to characterize the multitudes of complex and predominant Fe0, FeII and FeIII phases found in single microscopic (< 70 \u00b5m) grains of Luna-24 regolith samples to gain novel knowledge about their origin and formation. This samples were sourced from the sample return mission \u201cLuna-24\u201d in 1976. Recently there has been much debate about the origin and formation mechanism of nano particular Fe0 and FeIII respectively. The overall concentration of both phases is too low in the powdered Luna-24 sample which makes the focussed study of them difficult. By studying single grains rich in Fe instead of the diluted powder it is expected to gain novel knowledge of the occurring phases and their formation. By using SMS it is possible to do spatially resolved measurements of the single grains. This non-destructive method provides much more detail into formation processes, impossible without SMS.","1063":"The partitioning of ferric iron during magma ocean crystallization and solidification of the lower mantle exerts key control on the early redox evolution of Earth-sized planets, as it determines the character of the earliest atmosphere and the potential formation of deep oxidized domains which may later drive geochemical of the entire planet and surface.  We propose to use synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy to determine partitioning of Fe3+ between silicate melt coexisting bridgmanite [nominally (Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)O3] and Ca-perovskite [(Ca,Mg,Fe)SiO3], precipitated in diamond anvil experiments at 30-80 GPa and 3500-4500 K.  The high accuracy of SMS and the high spatial resolution afforded at ID14 are uniquely capable of the required analyses.  Results will be used to calibrate a thermodynamic model for Fe3+ stability in lower mantle molten and solid silicates and applied to better understand the redox evolution of solidifying terrestrial planets","1064":"During crystallisation, a small proportion of diamonds (no more than 2%), captures tiny inclusions of other minerals. These mineral inclusions sometimes derive from great depths and are our only window into the Earth\u2019s transition zone (410-660 km) and the lower mantle (660-2900 km), regions of our planet, impossible to sample directly. \r\nHere we propose to implement the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (beamline ID14) in order to measure Fe3+\/Fe2+ in the mineral inclusions (ferropericlase, Ca-perovskite, majoritic garnet) within two large diamonds and also in separate 10 majoritic garnets, all from Juina, Brazil. The second aim of this proposal is to use these data for devising an oxygen barometer for the deep mantle, that currently does not exist.\r\nThis will have important implications to the mantle rheology and transport properties as well as to mantle convection and material circulation between the upper and lower mantle. \r\n","1065":"The redox conditions of the magma ocean on early Earth had a far-reaching impact on the composition and evolution of the silicate mantle and atmosphere. In this study, we propose to investigate the iron oxidation state of silicate melts under metallic-iron saturated conditions, for the first time, reaching pressures and temperatures up to 135 GPa and 5500 K, respectively. The samples will be synthesized in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, simulating conditions corresponding to a deep magma ocean. Recovered samples, which exhibit micron-scale reacted areas, are then subjected to focused ion beam processing. The exposed quenched silicate melts will be analysed using nano-focused synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, allowing us to determine their Fe3+\/\u03a3Fe ratios. Our results will offer new constraints regarding the composition and evolution of early Earth.","1066":"In this experiment, we aim to investigate the density as well as the electronic, elastic and thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-bearing Fe-Si-alloys at pressures above 300 GPa and temperatures up to several thousands of degrees. Therefore, nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) and powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) are planned to be used. Applying the NIS technique brings the advantage of studying the lattice dynamics in order to gain the thermodynamic sample characterization. The measured phonon density of states provides the Debye phonon average velocity (vD), which is necessary to calculate the compressional (vp) and shear velocity (vs) of the material, in combination with the density and bulk modulus obtained by XRD. The measurements and following calculations will allow us to refine the amount of hydrogen and silicon in the Earth\u2019s core, to explain its observed seismic parameters.","1067":"We aim to study temperature dependent local order phenomena and their influence on the phonon diffuse scattering in the mineral olivine. Olivine forms a solid solution series with two symmetry independent metal cation sites. It was proposed in literature, that the thermal history of the sample significantly influences the cation partitioning. Here, we want to investigate possible local order phenomena alongside the cation partitioning and their influence on the dynamic properties of the material. For this we want to utilize variable temperature single crystal diffuse scattering experiments which provide a unique way of probing local correlations in the distribution of the metal cations, related relaxations of the oxygen ions and their influence on the phonon dynamics in the material. ","1068":"Many fundamental processes evolve over months and years, including 1) the strengthening of fault zones in the interseismic period between earthquakes, 2) the sequestration of carbon-bearing minerals in subsurface geologic reservoirs, 3) charge cycling in batteries, 4) the reactions between mixing magmas preceding volcanic eruptions, and 5) the degradation of fossils. Characterizing these processes in experiments typically requires unnatural methods of increasing the rates of reactions, or periodically removing the material from the apparatus or host material. Organization of a group of experts focused on these processes into a BAG will provide significant advances in our understanding of these processes. The BAG will enable far longer experiments than achieved previously that reveal the 4D evolution in situ, without significant perturbation of the sample, and without unnatural acceleration of the rates of the processes.","1069":"Several studies have highlighted that nucleation reactions can occur via multi-step mechanisms with nanoscale intermediates. Whereas some nucleation pathways are well characterized and described in bulk solutions, their evolution in Single-Digit Nanoconfinement (SDN) is still unknown. The goal of this proposal is to explore the precipitation in 3 nm silica SDN of several sulfate phases XSO4 (with X= Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) using our reliable experimental methods. To reach this goal, 3 nm nanochannels, already filled with Na2SO4 solution will be immersed in electrolyte solutions of XCl2 (with X= Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) and characterized using Hard-ray reflectivity. The electrolyte transport in the nanochannels, especially pore clogging, will be characterized as a function of the ability of ions to form various ion pairs in solution. ","1070":"Being pristine samples from depths that we cannot reach, mineral inclusions in natural diamond have attracted much interest for their potential to shed light on the composition of the Earth interior and the process of diamond formation. Sulphide inclusions are very common and have been studied to understand the occurrence of sulphur and chalcophile elements in the mantle.  Sulphide inclusions are still studied mostly ex situ, employing destructive techniques that necessarily cause the loss of information regarding the relationship between the host and the inclusion, and often risk to provide only a partial sampling of the inclusions. Thus, we propose to couple diffraction and tomography to characterize the inclusions without breaking the diamond host. This approach will allow us to identify the phases entrapped in the inclusions, evaluate their morphology and orientation, to get  insight into the growth environment  and on the time of formation of host-inclusion pair.","1071":"Ice is water frozen into a solid state. There are at least 20 different polymorphic forms of ice. The aims of this proposal are multi-fold: (a) to collect excellent quality X-ray PDF data at ambient pressure for different phases of H2O and D2O ices and liquid water (from  300K down to 10K); (b) to refine PDFs using Independent Atom Model (IAM) with Reversed Monte Carlo (RMC) modelling of all these structures, (c) use the same X-ray PDF data  utilising Hirshfeld Atom Refinement which is based on aspherical atomic scattering factors,  and to compare the results obtained using these two approaches, (d) to compare results of our experiments and refinements to the neutron PDFs. We propose 6 shifts for studies of both H2O and D2O ices to get in total ca. 30-40 PDF data sets for both categories of ices. Validation of Quantum Crystallographic PDF approach will open new research opportunities not only in an incredibly intense ice research but also in all other fields which apply PDFs .  ","1073":"  The fast rise in demand for \u2018critical\u2019 metals (Pt, Pd, Os, Ag, Au etc.) may raise a potential obstacle to the widespread adoption of low-carbon energy technologies. Hence, the development of more efficient and sustainable processing technologies (e.g. extraction and leaching) for the exploitable deposits and mining tailings for the exhausted deposits is essential. Pentlandites contain the highest economical amount of Pd (and Pt) in a refractory form among all the major sulphides. Despite the large accumulated knowledge on Pd and Pt in pentlandite, no complete spectroscopic studies have been performed to date. The incorporation mechanism is still highly disputable and most of the Pd-Pt-bearing pentlandite remains in the deposit\u2019s tailings. Thus, the aim of the present project is to characterize the states of Pt and Pd in pentlandite to elucidate the role of pentlandite as a concentrator of refractory PGEs from three world-class deposits: Lac-des-\u00celes, Bushveld, and Norilsk 1.","1074":"The most recent advances in mineral dating (geo-thermochronology) rely on the analysis of radioactive isotopes in \u00b5m3 volumes using Laser-Ablation ICP-MS. However, the efficiency of laser ablation for a given element depends on the minerals host and, matrix-matched standards are thus required. We have developed new protocols to obtain standards of controlled composition (U, Th, Pb) by synthesis routes for magnetite, spinel and calcite. The standards have been successfully tested with LA-ICP-MS and the next step is to characterize the atomic environment of (U, Th, Pb) so that these synthetic standards can be distributed to the geochronology community. XANES on 20BM (ROBL) is the most appropriate technique to achive that goal for the concentrations of interest. Compared with natural standards, a major step forward would be the manufacture of LA-ICP-MS standards with adjustable U, Th and Pb content.","1075":"Almost all skeletal tissues record visible marks such as Lines of Arrested Growth (LAGs) that form annually during the unfavourable season. The identification of LAGs serves in palaeontology to calculate individual ages and to model the growth of organisms. However, sometimes bone growth slows down without ceasing, which implies LAGs are not systematically formed in bone tissue. Accordingly, this leads to the construction of inaccurate growth models. However, these seasonal modulations in bone growth are produced by internal physiological changes in the body, so that what is not recorded structurally could nevertheless be recorded chemically. Previous experiment (ESRF BM23 beamline ES1272) revealed for the first time in fossil dinosaur bones that these LAGs corresponded to marked enrichments in strontium (Sr). In order to validate these data and propose a biological model for Sr incorporation into bone tissue, it is crucial to perform the same analyses to bones of modern vertebrate.","1076":"Seafloor hydrothermal vents emit essential trace metals such as iron into the (deep) ocean. A key topic is the fate and transport range for this hydrothermal iron, to better understand its impact on the ocean nutrient inventory. Evidence is emerging that silicon coprecipitation and complexation with organic matter extend the lifetime of Fe in the ocean. We collected iron-rich nanoparticles and aggregates from one of the most iron-rich hydrothermal plumes know so far in the mid-Atlantic Rainbow vent field. We characterized the particles in detail with micro(spectro)scopy (TEM) and chemical methods. Sub-samples were then used in an aging experiment, to monitor changes to the iron particles and their interaction with seawater. Marked changes in particle morphology and chemistry occurred and we propose to use Fe K-edge EXAFS to determine the structural evolution. Our results will further elucidate how hydrothermal iron behaves in the global ocean and to what extent it becomes bioavailable.","1077":"Sn is a rare metal with very high industrial demand. However, the magmatic-hydrothermal processes that affect Sn mobilization and transport in the deep\r\n crust and their role in the formation of Sn(-W) crustal deposits are still poorly understood. This is due to the lack of constraints on the ability of volatile phases\r\n to extract and transport Sn from deep to superjacent environments. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of fluid composition and redox state on the\r\n partitioning of Sn between granitic magmas and volatiles, and its transport at deep crustal conditions (500 \u2013 850 \u00b0C, 0.3-0.8 GPa). Experiments will be conducted\r\n in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) combined with SXRF and XAS analysis at BM23\/ID24- DCM beamlines.","1078":"The mineralogy and phase transitions in the upper mantle have been determined from models that rely on seismic data and high-pressure experiments. However, these experiments have been run at temperatures ~500\u00b0C hotter than the ambient mantle. This significantly hinders our understanding of the minerals present and their phase transitions at temperatures along the oceanic geotherm. We propose to conduct high-pressure multi-anvil experiments combined with in-situ XRD at ID06-LVP using a fertile mantle starting material to recreate the subsolidus conditions of the mantle transition zone (16-21 GPa and 1400-1600\u02daC). The goal is to determine the minerals present across the P-T range of the mantle transition zone and constrain clinopyroxene to majorite transition and verify the occur of two majorites. This will allow us to refine the phase diagram for the upper mantle which has implications for the interpretation of seismological observations of the mantle and thermodynamic models.","1079":"The graphite-diamond transition is an important high-pressure phase transition because of its applications in geosciences, materials science, physics, and the diamond industry. Experiments on the phase transition have been limited to temperature below 2000 K. Here, we propose to precisely determine the graphite-diamond transition boundary at temperatures above 2000 K by in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements. We have developed an X-ray transparent boron-dopped diamond heater to achieve extreme temperature at high pressure. We will determine the transition boundary by detecting a resistance change of the heater, coupled with in-situ determination of pressure using the MgO pressure scale. The experimentally determined diamond-graphite boundary will represent the highest temperature-pressure achievable in large-volume press and fill the gap in the temperature range between 2000 K and the triple temperature. The result is expected to be extensively cited in multiple research disciplines. ","1080":"Phlogopite is an important metasomatic, hydrous, potassic phase in peridotite from on- and off-cratonic lithospheric mantle. It is significant in the petrogenesis of mantle-derived magmas, including micaceous kimberlites, ultramafic lamprophyres, kamafugites, lamproites, which are all potential sources of diamonds.\r\n\r\nWe lack experimental investigations close to the limits of phlogopite stability in a model mantle composition enriched in K with varying amounts of H2O from 4 to 9 GPa (120 to 300 km). Variations in the %H2O available determine the shape and location of the solidus, and hence the onset of partial melting of a K-enriched mantle.\r\n\r\nThe study will determine the stability fields of phlogopite in the Earth upper mantle as a function of P, T, and bulk %H2O, using the large volume press at ID06 in combination with in-situ XRD.\r\n\r\nThe study will contribute to more complete modelling of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary of a metasomatised mantle enriched in K and H2O.","1081":"Deserpentinisation in subduction zones has potential implications regarding seismicity, contribution to arc volcanism or the coupling\/decoupling transition between slab and mantle. Indeed, one of the particularities of serpentine destabilisation is that it can produce large quantities of aqueous fluids at depths (serpentine =13 wt.% H2O). We will monitor the evolution of one of the dehydration reaction \"Fe-brucite + antigorite\u201d that occurs in natural hydrous rock assemblages containing multiple hydrous phases during subductions by X-ray diffraction using resistively heated diamond anvil cell. Our purpose is to constrain the nucleation of solid dehydration products, the reaction progress, the kinetics and the P\/T dependence of the reaction.","1082":"This proposal aims to explore the high-pressure structural stability of a newly synthesized hydrous silicate-carbonate, Ca6Si2O7(CO3)2(OH)2, formed at 8.5 GPa and 800\u00b0C. The novel phase exhibits a unique configuration with hydroxyl groups and trigonal carbon coordination. Using the ID15b beamline at ESRF, we plan to conduct single crystal diffraction experiments under high-pressure conditions to assess its compressibility and identify potential polymorphs or transitions. The results will provide insights into the structural behavior of this mixed volatile-bearing silicate-carbonate and its potential role as a carbon-water storage medium under mantle conditions.","1083":"Iron sulphides are speculated to play a crucial role in understanding the internal structure and dynamics of Martian interiors as they are expected to crystallize and persist within the Martian core as it undergoes cooling. These compounds exhibit complex crystal chemical behaviours under high pressures, with recent studies and our preliminary findings uncovering several unexpected new phases. Building on our initial experiments, we propose to investigate the crystal structures and electronic properties of novel iron sulphide phases that are stable under conditions akin to those within the Martian core. These iron sulphide phases will be synthesized in laser-heated diamond anvil cells utilizing high pressures and temperatures up to 40 GPa and 2000 K. Characterization of the samples will be conducted using single crystal X-ray diffraction and synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. The outcomes of this study will enhance our knowledge regarding the state and evolution of the Martian core.","1084":"Hydrous silicate phase D is considered to be a potentially important carrier and reservoir in Earth\u2019s deep interior. The experiments aim to investigate the crystal structural evolution, thermal equation of state, spin state of iron, and hydrogen bond configuration in (Fe2+, Fe3+)-bearing Al-Phase D utilizing the Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction and Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source spectroscopy at high pressure-temperature conditions (up to 80 GPa and 1200 K), and to determine their potential influences on the properties of the Earth\u2019s deep interior.","1085":"Carbonates are the most important C\u2013bearing minerals and key phases in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle. Their complex stability fields at HP \u2013 HT conditions are strongly influenced by both chemical composition and cation ordering. As in the lower mantle the carbonates composition is supposed to be enriched in Fe, the importance of a deep knowledge of the behaviour of (dis)ordered Fe-bearing carbonates at non-ambient conditions is evident. However, the stability of (dis)ordered ankerite Ca(Mg1-xFex)(CO3)2 (0\u2264x\u22640.7) and its polymorphs at HP \u2013 HT is a poorly explored field. The present proposal is aimed at studying the crystal structure evolution of both ordered and disordered ankerites from room conditions up to 70 GPa and 800 K, by means of high-resolution SC-XRD experiments. The obtained results will allow to cover P \u2013 T conditions from (cold and hot) subducting slabs towards the Earth's mantle, integrating the phase stability of ankerite with the effect of cation disorder.","1086":"Recent studies of Fe-O phase diagrams have revealed important yet not fully understood phenomena, such as new Fe-O stoichiometries, changes in iron spin and oxidation states, which are important for properly modeling both deep planetary interiors and high-velocity meteorite impacts. The important discrepancies observed between static and dynamic compression phase diagram emphasizes our lack of understanding of the underlying transition mechanisms. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is particularly well-suited to tackle these questions and explore the interplay between the electronic and atomic structures. In the continuity of our previous experiments at ESRF, we propose Time-Resolved (TR)-XAS at Fe K-edge of laser-shock compressed Fe2O3. Moreover, as FeO has similar transitions but possibly with a different physics, we propose to also investigate this latter thus providing unprecedented knowledge of phase transition mechanisms in iron oxides.","1087":"The purpose of the proposed experiments is to apply methods of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) in laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DACs) in order to reveal the conditions when vacancy-containing Fe-bearing pyroxenes can be synthesized.","1088":"Ferropericlase [(Mg,Fe)O, Fp] are supposed to be the most abundant oxide mineral in super-Earths. However, the chemical stability of Fp in the deep interiors of volatile-rich super-Earths is still unknown. Here we plan to examine the stability field of Fp and possible reactions of Fp with water in the mantles of super-Earths (up to 300 GPa and 4000 K) with nanotwinned diamond anvil cells and X-ray diffraction. Our findings are vital for the mineralogical model of volatile-rich super-Earths.","1089":"Crystallization is a critical process in Earth-like planetary evolution. In the early stage of planetary formation, differentiation between metallic core and silicate mantle happens in the liquid state but upon secular cooling, crystallization starts both in the mantle and the core. \r\nHere, we aim at developing a new time-resolved experimental approach enabled by the high flux of the ESRF-EBS pink beam, the high repetition rate of the EIGER detector, and time-resolved temperature measurements for liquidus temperature determination, in addition to developments in multigrain crystallography to monitor the microstructural imprints of crystallization processes. \r\nThis unique combination of fast in-situ diagnostics will allow us to accurately determine the crystallization temperature of a well-controlled and homogeneous liquid before chemical migration, whereas the multi-grain analysis on the quench will be used to decipher the phases formed and the texture of the crystallized materials. ","1090":"Within a growing number of icy satellites of the outer solar system, the presence of liquid water has been suggested in a form of subsurface oceans. An intriguing aspect of extra-terrestrial ocean worlds is the influence of high pressure (HP) on their physical state and thermochemical evolution. While a variety of volatile compounds are expected to be present in significant amount in the interior of icy moons, some of these compounds should be stable in the form of gas clathrate hydrates. Clathrate formation and destabilization govern the volatile reservoir and chemical exchange in the interior, affecting astrobiological potential of subsurface oceans. While mixed guest molecules clathrates are expected to be present in the large ocean worlds, almost all previous HP studies have been performed on pure end-member compositions. Herein, we propose to study mixed CH4-CO2 clathrates at relevant HP-LT conditions using in situ X-Ray diffraction in a cryostat-cooled diamond anvil cell.","1091":"The outgassing history of the Early Earth remains a key topic in geoscience because the presence of volatile species in its interior,\r\n such as H2O, CO2, has a strong influence on its dynamics and evolution. We know that most of volatiles have been outgassed from the uppermost Earth's mantle while a significant fraction of volatiles have never been outgassed from the deeper Earth. The location of these deep volatiles remains highly debated. The solid Earth's lower mantle is one potential candidate, but the few literature data on noble gases solubilities in its main constituent, bridgmanite, concern mainly Ar and are controversial. Data on heavy noble gases at relevant conditions are required to validate or reject the scenario. Here, we propose a new approach to constrain the amount of Kr and Xe retained in bridgmanite at relevant conditions (25-130 GPa, 2000-4000 K) based on quantitative in-situ \u00b5XRF and single crystal XRD measurements in the LHDAC at high dilution levels.","1092":"Here we aim at measuring the density of hydrous carbonatite melts (> 40 wt% CO2, < 15 wt% SiO2, < 10 wt% H2O) that are representative of carbon-rich melts\r\n produced by the partial melting of carbonated mantle rocks between 50 and 200 km depth. These melts play a key role in the geochemical and geodynamical\r\n evolution of the mantle, in the transport of carbon to the surface and in the regulation of the deep carbon cycle. Density will be measured between 1-5 GPa and\r\n 1300-2000 K in a panoramic Paris-Edinburgh (PE) press by the X-ray absorption technique at ID27 beamline. The results will provide insights into the mobility of\r\n carbonated melts at depth and their role as carbon reservoirs and carriers in the Earth\u2019s interior.\r\n","1093":"Gypsum CaSO4\u00b72H2O is one of the most common hydrated minerals in Earth\u2019s crust. In this project we focus on the high pressure (>4 GPa) phase transition to gypsum-II to experimentally determine quantitative charge density redistribution. The use of quantum crystallography offers a better understanding of interactions within the crystal and its energetic properties. Multipole density model refinement demands excellent quality of single-crystal XRD data, characterized by high resolution and completeness. Moreover, Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) restricts access to reciprocal space and introduces experimental noise.\r\nID-27 at ESRF offers exceptional solutions, very well collimated X-ray beam, extra stabilisation of the whole data collection system, excellent detector, high brilliance of the beam. These factors effectively address all the experimental challenges. Proposed research will enhance the role of quantum-crystallography in Earth and material sciences at high pressure.","1094":"We propose an synchrotron radiation-based tomographic study of the oral plates of osteostracans from the Silurian of Estonia. Osteostracans are extinct jawless fish, sister to jawed vertebrates and, as such, inform on the evolution of traits that define jawed vertebrates, including their jaws and teeth. We will the only two known specimens of osteostracan that preserve their oral plates in situ and use these data to (1) establish their tissue and anatomical homologies to vertebrate jaws, (2) construct computed tomographic models from which meshes can be derived for range of motion (ROM), Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) and Computed Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses that will inform on (3) their range of motion and function. These results will not only provide fundamental insights into the anatomy and feeding ecology of the sister lineage of jawed vertebrates, but also provide insight into the nature of the ancestral jawed vertebrate. ","1095":"The interaction between dehydration reactions and deformation in metamorphic environments is important in tectonics. While experiments have been run to understand how dehydration reactions and deformation interact, there is still a gap in our understanding because previous work could not simultaneously resolve the temporal and spatial evolution of grain-scale processes. Here we propose to use operando 4D microtomography (4D\u00b5CT) to directly document dehydration in shearing rocks on the grain scale, allowing us to unequivocally determine conditions where dehydration can lead to shear instabilities.We will react and shear gypsum fault gouge and pre-cut gypsum rocks at a range of conditions and collect discrete 4D\u00b5CT data while monitoring sample strength and permeability. The resulting data will link grain-scale processes to the macro-scale evolution of the samples allowing the formulation of models for the coupling between processes in dehydrating deforming rocks.\r\n","1096":"Metamorphosis in extant amphibians is unique among vertebrates Its evolutionary origin remains poorly known, i.e. when metamorphosis first appeared and whether it is a derived feature of extant amphibians or whether it has been inherited from a common ancestor. The fossil preservation of soft tissues (i.e., intestines, eyes) is extremely rare. We propose to fill this gap by investigating with high resolution and contrast the exceptionally preserved 3D anatomy of some of the earliest known amphibians, discovered in a fossil site near Montceau-les-mines (France) including complete developmental sequence and soft tissues known to transform during metamorphosis. This project aims at applying synchrotron microtomography to attest changes of the intestines that could reflect a diet shift and change soft the eyes linked to different visual capacities. This comparative analysis will be crucial for understanding the evolution of metamorphosis at a critical time in amphibian evolution.

As those measures were made incrementally along the growth axis, they correspond to a time frame, that is the one of the tooth mineralisation rate of the specimen. Daily increments of dentine that are separated by the lines of Von Ebner1, can be counted on thin sections under light microscope to estimate the time represented in the whole dentine of each specimen, and the precise time recorded by each sampling point. Once variations in isotopic compositions (and thus ecology) will have been related to a time frame, this method will be applicable on fossil specimens  tease apart the influence of ecological and environmental parameters.","1098":"The genus Lystrosaurus, a mammalian ancestor, is famous for surviving the worst extinction of all, the end-Permian mass extinction. The fossil record chronicles the survival of this genus before, through, and after the extinction, offering a unique opportunity to unravel its survival strategies. Many aspects of Lystrosaurus paleobiology have been studied, except the evolution of its brain size. The brain is an energy expensive organ, which puts a high selective pressure on it when resources become scarce; yet, it is also the seat of cognition, and may help to behaviourally adapt to a rapidly changing environment. As such, brain size may decrease or increase depending on the evolutionary response to mass extinction events. Documenting variations of the brain size in Lystrosaurus through the end-Permian mass extinction will shed new light on the evolutionary response of the central nervous system to high stress conditions, and how these dramatic events have shaped the mammalian brain.\r\n","1099":"Crystallisation processes affect the rheological properties of magma like its viscosity and buoyancy. It has a direct impact on its ability to migrate in the crust and erupt. Here we propose for the first time in situ crystallisation experiments to study crystal nucleation and growth in a basaltic magma at high pressure and high temperature under water saturated conditions. We will combine fast synchrotron X-ray microtomography with a unique Internally Heated Pressure Vessel to simulate magma storage conditions within the crust at pressures <150 MPa and temperatures <1200 \u00b0C in presence of volatiles (H2O). These experiments will allow us to capture, visualise and quantify crystallisation kinetics in basaltic magmas at pre- and syn-eruptive conditions, fundamental to improve models and our understanding of magma dynamics with major implications for the volcanic risk mitigation associated with basaltic systems.","1100":"This proposal seeks to generate high quality 3D image data sets of two unique early human fossils recently found during fieldwork in northern Kenya. These are a juvenile male cranium with associated partial pelvis and an unrelated juvenile male mandible, both attributable to the species Paranthropus boisei and over 1.5 million years old. Despite the substantial fossil record of this enigmatic hominin species, these juvenile specimens are unprecedented finds. Image data will unlock key aspects of their developmental age and pattern of maturation, the developing brain, the sensory characteristics of hearing and balance, and the biomechanics of bipedal locomotion. The results will make a major contribution to our knowledge of P. boisei, the species with the most extreme adaptations of it jaws in the human evolutionary tree. ","1101":"The aim of the proposal is to carry out propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography to investigate a diversified association of fossils with the unique \u2018Rokycany ball\u2019 type of preservation. Rokycany balls are siliceous nodules found in the Middle Ordovician of the Prague Basin (Czech Republic). The purpose of the study is to cast light on biotic interactions of extinct life forms in this ecosystem by incorporating indications of soft tissue decay products, trace fossils, or evidence of palaeophysiology and behaviour in selected specimens, captured by a specific taphonomic process of rapid nodule formation. The project will consist of several case studies highlighting different aspects of the Rokycany ball type of preservation, deciphering phenomena that modern biology cannot study or that have no recent equivalents, through a \u2018palaeontology for biologists\u2019 approach. We anticipate the results to be published in high-profile journals, similar to our recent work.","1102":"A key task in volcanology is correctly interpreting volcano monitoring signals in terms of magma migration to the Earth\u2019s surface. The microcrystals and pores in volcanic rocks record crucial information on magma ascent dynamics. X-ray microtomography enables their effective examination, providing direct 3D imaging of rock microstructures at high resolution. However, cutting-edge phase contrast X-ray imaging and phase retrieval methods, available at synchrotrons, are sometimes needed to properly investigate these rocks due to limited density and chemical contrasts between microcrystals and surrounding matrix glass. We intend to apply these approaches for a systematic analysis of rocks erupted during reference eruptions of the Campi Flegrei caldera, one of Europe's most dangerous volcanoes, in an unrest phase since 2005. Our aim is to obtain a comprehensive dataset on its magma ascent mechanisms and timescales, useful to reconstruct pre-eruptive scenarios and interpret monitoring data.","1103":"The internal compositional zoning of natural crystals provide a record of their growth process and history. Observation and interpretation of these patterns are\r\nfundamental to our knowledge of the Earth, providing crucial information to workers studying nearly every aspect of the Earth system. In this proposal, we seek\r\nto understand the conditions responsible for the crystallisation of the mineral zircon from silicate melts by imaging in three dimensions the fine-scale chemical\r\n(<1\u03bcm) oscillatory zonation, and relating this zonation to the common apatite inclusions found within zircon grains. These observations will form the basis for\r\nfurther numerical modelling experiments that will reconstruct the conditions of crystal growth, allowing us to correctly interpret the growth history and composition\r\nof zircon crystals. This proposal is ultimately motivated by the crucial role that the analysis of zircon plays in our understanding of earth history.","1104":"Mudstones are considered an ideal candidate for hosting a Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) due to their exceptionally low porosity and permeability, coupled with a high buffering capacity. However, the integrity of these properties can be compromised by the heat generated from radioactive decay. This heat may cause organic matter within the mudstones to mature, potentially creating new pores, and altering the mechanical properties of the clay matrix. This project, to our knowledge, will be the first time to comprehensively assess and quantify the effects of heat on the pore system with in-situ heating at nano-scale, together with Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) to reveal the nano-scale evolution of mechanical properties of mudstones over temperature. The results will enhance theoretical understanding on mudstone behaviour with increased temperatures for earth history and provide vital data for the engineering design and long-term prediction of many other subsurface applications.","1105":"Obsidian, a prevalent naturally occurring glass formed through rapid cooling of rhyolitic lava, holds significance in earth and material sciences, as well as archaeology. While black obsidian is widely recognized, lesser-known variants exhibit diverse colors such as green, blue, red, brown, and silver, whith often heterogeneous mixing areas. Iron, a key component in obsidian, plays a crucial role in coloration. In black obsidian, dispersed iron nanocrystals contribute to its distinct color and rheological properties To unravel the relationships betwwen iron environment\/redox and color\/rheological properties, nano-XANES emerges as a crucial tool, enabling the investigation of iron speciation at the nanoscale. This approach aims to discern the precise environment, redox state of iron, and its impact on color variation in crystallized and non-crystallized areas of heterogeneous obsidians.","1106":"Plate tectonics and atmospheric cycles are directly linked. Secular evolution in the atmosphere is known to have changed the surface geochemistry of Earth, but more profound implications to recycling and mantle chemistry remain less constrained. Atmospheric oxygenation seems to have affected the composition and overall evolution of magmas through time, considering that the Great Oxidation Event occurred between 2.45 and 2.2 billion years ago and magmas became more oxidised during that period. However, the cryptic aspects of how an increasingly oxygenated atmosphere has changed mantle-derived magmas at the mineral scale remain broadly unknown. Exploring surface-mantle cycling in the early Earth and ascertaining when plate tectonics started thus requires deep investigation of crystallised magmas. In this proposal, we aim to use \u03bc-XANES to measure the sulphur valence state in magmatic apatite inclusions hosted by zircon crystals to understand how magmas change fugacity across time.

We propose to determine its scavenging process in ferromanganese (FeMn) marine deposits of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, which leads to its billion times enrichment compared to seawater. To study samples from all known deposits among the three world\u2019s largest oceans is a key for understanding the genesis of this marine Pt resource, its specificity, and its universality. The results of this research will be of relevance to mineral extraction and processing. This research is the main part of a post-doc project.","1109":"Planetary cores are constituted of iron alloyed with lighter elements (S, C, O, Si or H). Understanding the phase diagrams as well as the physical properties of these alloys under extreme conditions is crucial to model the thermal evolution and the dynamics of core crystallization, at the origin of the magnetic field. In the present proposal, we plan to use LCF to obtain quantitative composition from XAS spectra acquired at high pressure in the temperature quenched samples, employing the laser-heating set-up available on ID24 DCM. This will enable us to determine binary or ternary phase diagrams under extreme conditions.","1110":"This proposal aims at constraining the redox state in quenched experiments representative for the Earth\u2019s magma ocean using the Fe2+\/Fe3+ ratio measured by synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy.

In rare cases, inclusions of different minerals are captured simultaneously. Here we propose to implement the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (beamline ID14) in order to measure Fe3+\/Fe2+ in paired garnet-clinopyroxene inclusions. These inclusions are of eclogitic origin meaning that at some point in time they were at the surface, and were later transported into the deep mantle by subduction. The study of these inclusions will permit us not only to identify the oxidation state of the upper mantle eclogitic rocks, but to also assess how oxidised is the material transported by subduction. This study will have important implications to the mantle rheology and transport properties as well as to mantle convection and material circulation by subduction","1112":"The redox state established in deep magma oceans influences the formation of distinct geochemical domains and early atmospheres on rocky planets. The estimated mean pressure (P) of silicate-alloy equilibria in Earth\u2019s magma ocean reaches >60 GPa, but existing experimental constraints on the iron (Fe) redox speciation applicable to magma oceans are limited to 28 GPa and yield conflicting predictions regarding the stabilization of oxidized species in deep magma oceans. \r\n\r\nThis study aims to establish the effect of P on Fe disproportionation reactions and spin crossover of Fe in dense silicate melt up to 80 GPa.

We recently conducted experiments at the M\u00f6ssbauer Beamline of the APS and demonstrated that we can identify minerals and unravel redox evolution on such asteroidal materials using Nuclear Forward Scattering. Based on these results, pivotal information on the formation conditions of iron-bearing phases have been proposed but cannot be confirmed without measurements performed using a highly focussed and bright Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source at low temperature. This setup is only available on ID14 (ESRF). We propose to analyse HY2 and O-Rex samples (loaned by JAXA and NASA) together with meteoritical analogues, to unravel the formation conditions of clay and oxide minerals present in these unique asteroidal samples. This will allow us to put firm constaints on the mineral carriers of water and oxidized materials during planets formation.","1114":"The study of carbonates is fundamental for the understanding of the Earth\u2019s deep carbon cycle. The double carbonate ankerite, Ca(FexMg1-x)(CO3)2 (0\u2264x\u22640.7), with high Fe contents is also expected to undergo a similar spin transition but no studies have been reported so far. Disordered ankerite is expected in the Earth\u2019s mantle so it is of utmost relevance to understand the effect of disorder on the spin transition and electronic properties in this context. The aim of the experiment is to investigate the electronic and structural properties of ordered and disordered ankerite samples upon compression to 75 GPa, using a combination of X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) at the beamline ID20.

With this study we aim to extend our understanding of the structural phase transitions and electronic properties of nitrogen. The prototypical diatomic molecule nitrogen shows an impressive polymorphism. Under pressure, delta-N2 undergoes several structural transitions to epsilon-, zeta- and amorphous black eta-N2 at room temperature. Our approach involves two complementary techniques - X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRS allows us to study the changes in electronic structure associated with the pressure-induced transformations in nitrogen. At the same time, XRD measurements will be used to monitor the structural changes in conjunction with subsequent AIMD simulations.

As the only team selected by NASA to perform SXRF analysis on these two lithologies, we have the unique opportunity to measure the trace element content, especially rare-earth elements (REEs), in Ca-rich minerals (e.g. Ca-phosphates and carbonates) for direct comparison of the two main rock types found on the surface of asteroid Bennu. Our SXRF results of REE enrichments in these rocks will help to better understand the aqueous alteration and geological history of Bennu and provide unique insight into the role of fluids in such ancient asteroids from the early Solar System years.","1119":" The geochemical behavior of Sb under reducing conditions is closely linked to the formation of digenetic iron sulfides. Since very few data is currently available on Sb speciation in such minerals, including pyrite (FeS2) ubiquitously found in surface environments, we aim at obtaining molecular scale information by performing XANES\/EXAFS measurements at the Sb K-edge (30,491 eV) on synthetic FeS and FeS2 samples representative of continental sedimentary surface environments. Redox and structural information gained from XAS spectroscopy will be used together with Sb concentrations in solutions (ICP-MS), and with XRD measurement. such information is crucial to uncover the steps of Sb biogeochemical cycle in reducing surface environments and to propose conceptual models for Sb speciation in soil and sedimentary reservoirs.

Increased release of CH4 from marine sediments is a possible feedback mechanism of global warming and Mn-AOM is a potential pathway to prevent the escape of CH4 from the sediments, which has not been recognized so far. We plan to collect Mn and Fe XAS spectra of sediment samples for field sites where geochemical profiles suggest the occurrence of Mn-AOM and of sediment samples from incubation experiments, in which addition of Mn oxides increased CH4 oxidation. XAS analyses are expected to demonstrate that Mn-(oxyhydr)oxides (MnOx) are available in the sediment and that the oxidation of CH4 coincides with their reduction.

Thus, the mechanical behaviour of fPc has important consequences for the rheology of the lower mantle, and by consequence, the evolution of the Earth through convection of materials and heat through the mantle. Much work as been done on the Mg pure end-member of fPc as well as fPc-Bgm aggregates. The effect of iron on fPc mechanical response under pressure was studied at 300 MPa and compression textures were measured using the diamond anvil cell. Flow laws, i.e. the relationship between applied stress and the resulting strain rates, were never measured above 300 MPa in iron-bearing fPC. This is a critical gap as iron content of fPc has been shown to modify its physical properties significantly. The lack of understanding of the effect of Fe on the mechanical properties of fPc under pressure is a true knowledge gap that we wish to address in this proposal.","1122":"Hydrated tectonic plates transport water as hydrous minerals like serpentine to depths over 250 km in subduction zones. Serpentine, key in ultramafic rocks like peridotite, carries up to 13 wt.% H2O. Seismic studies suggest serpentinites cause anomalies in subduction zones, but the effects of temperature (T) and foliation on serpentine\u2019s elastic properties remain unclear. This project aims to measure compressional and shear wave velocities in serpentine, identifying seismic anomalies across pressure and temperature conditions using in-situ techniques like X-ray diffraction and ultrasonic interferometry.

The inner core has 3-4% density deficit compared with density of pure Fe. Interpretation of the density deficit requires accurate density measurements of the candidate Fe alloys at pressure and temperature conditions of the inner core. Following our successful compression experiments at ESRF (ES-1441) at inner-core pressures, we will focus on determination of thermal EOS of Fe and Fe-alloys up to 365 GPa and 3500 K. The proposed experiments include thermal EOS of pure Fe, Fe-1.37wt%C, Fe-4wt%Si, and a ternary Fe alloy, Fe-1wt%C-3wt%Si.

Tessellated calcified cartilage (TCC) provides the skeleton with both flexibility and stiffness, and fossil evidence shows that chondrichthyans developed this innovative tissue in place of bone. Our knowledge of TCC greatly lags behind that of bone and is mainly limited to 2D data. This project will be the first to visualise TCC in 3D in both extinct and extant chondrichthyans using propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SR\u03bcCT). Twenty-six specimens will be examined, focusing on the Meckel's cartilage (lower jaw) to observe variations linked to feeding mechanisms. These specimens represent diverse feeding strategies and span 400 million years of evolution.

In recent years, synchrotron micro Computed Tomography (SR\u00b5CT) of mammalian ancestors skulls at the ESRF has enabled access to traits that were previously out of reach. This project aims to use SR\u00b5CT to study adaptations to agonistic behaviours in mammalian ancestors (such as male-to-male combat, face biting, and sexual display) to demonstrate that social complexity predated the origin of mammals. It is a direct continuation of experiment LS-3174, which aimed to scan large mammalian ancestor skulls, but could not be completed because of the delay in the delivery of the large sample stage of BM18. To resolve this issue, we propose completing the experiment (6 shifts) by replacing the previous samples with specimens small enough to be scanned at BM18 using the current sample stage.","1128":"Fossilised faeces (coprolites) are overlooked in palaeontology but they reveal crucial information on the ecology and evolution of the animals that produced them and on their ecological and environmental interactions. Coprolites yield micro-remains of various digested species and provide unique insights into the paleofauna, paleoenvironment and trophic webs. The Carboniferous-Permian transition records shifts from humid to arid global climates in continental environments (including lakes). However, it is still unclear how life has adapted to these changes. Coprolites from lacustrine deposits of French continental basins will be studied using high-resolution methodologies (PPC-SR\u03bcCT) to analyse their content and internal structure.

However, the conditions of extraction of As from magmas and its transport by magmatic volatiles remain poorly understood. Here we will determine the partition coefficients of As between granitic melts and Cl\/S-bearing aqueous fluids and its speciation to provide new insight into the formation of Au-As deposits. Fluid-melt partitioning and speciation experiments will be performed in the FAME autoclave in conjunction with synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (SXRF) and absorption (XAS) spectroscopy at BM16B (FAME-UHD) beamline.","1130":"The speciation of Nb in silicate and carbonate glasses will be investigated using valence to core X-ray emission spectroscopy (V2C XES). Nb is classed as a \u201ccritical metal\u201d due to its importance for green energy solutions and electronic devices but insecure geopolitical supply. Globally, major Nb resources are associated with rocks that crystallised from a carbonate melt, called carbonatites, while some of the largest European Nb deposits are associated with unusual, highly alkaline, silicate melts. Currently the reason(s) why Nb is concentrated in these rocks are unknown. The ligands, O (as O2-, OH-, and CO32-), F and Cl, that complex with Nb exert a primary control on its geochemical behaviour. We have synthesised a series of Nb-bearing silicate and carbonate glasses that have systematically varying F contents. We will use V2C XES to distinguish between either predominately O or F coordination. This will significantly improve our ability to model the geochemical behaviour of Nb.","1131":"The aim of the project is to investigate the effect of iron on the chemical stability of calcium silicate perovskite (CaSiO3) in situ at conditions relevant to the Earth\u2019s lowermost mantle using powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (scXRD) and Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source (SMS) at pressures 90 \u2013 130 GPa and temperatures 2200 K \u2013 2800 K. To our knowledge, very little is known about the interaction of iron with CaSiO3 in lowermost mantle conditions, despite their anticipated co-existence in the mantle and Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB).","1132":"Experimental determination of phase equilibria at high pressure and high temperature is pivotal to interpreting geophysical and geochemical data that can help decipher the mineralogical composition of the Earth\u2019s deep interior. Oxygen fugacity is one of the key variables affecting the stability of minerals at high pressure and temperature as it sets the oxidation state of Fe in a given mantle phase assemblages. We propose to use synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy to study the oxidation state of Fe in (Mg,Fe2+,Fe3+,Al)(Si,Al,Fe3+)O3 bridgmanite and CaFe2O4-type aluminous phase [(Na,Mg,Fe2+)(Si,Al,Fe3+)2O4] synthesized at conditions of the shallow lower mantle under controlled oxygen fugacity in a multi-anvil press. Results will help inform geophysical and geochemical observations and interpretations, from seismic anomalies associated with the presence of subducted oceanic lithologies in the lower mantle to the crystal chemistry of retrograde mineral inclusions in super-deep diamonds.","1133":"CM-group carbonaceous chondrite meteorites are currently the best match for delivering water and organic materials to the terrestrial planets. However, they have been severely affected by the action of water driven reactions on their parent body which may have modified their water and organic content. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to understand how these water-rich meteorites were affected by aqueous alteration on their parent asteroid and how that fluid evolved over time. We propose to use Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer source  to measure Fe2+ and Fe3+ charge state ratios and determine the redox conditions that formed a suite of minerals produced by progressive aqueous alteration within the Winchcombe CM meteorite. From this result we will be able to evaluate how many fluids affected these asteroids and how those fluids evolved over time.","1134":"In this experiment, we aim to investigate the density as well as the electronic, elastic and thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-bearing Fe-Si-alloys at pressures above 300 GPa and temperatures up to several thousands of degrees. Therefore, nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) and powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) are planned to be used. Applying the NIS technique brings the advantage of studying the lattice dynamics in order to gain the thermodynamic sample characterization. The measured phonon density of states provides the average Debye phonon velocity (vD), which is necessary to calculate the compressional (vp) and shear velocity (vs) of the material, in combination with the density and bulk modulus obtained by XRD. The measurements and following calculations will allow us to refine the amount of hydrogen and silicon in the Earth\u2019s core, to explain its observed seismic parameters.

The potassium feldspars are classified with regard to Si\/Al order, from fully ordered microcline, to patrially ordered orthoclase and disordered sanidine. Diffuse scattering in Sanidines has been suggested to be a result of the distorted aluminosilicate framework, where diffuse streaks manifest the strain propagation through the sample due to the different ionic radii of Si and Al. Here we want to investigate possible local order phenomena with regard to composition and initial state of order.  For this we want to utilize variable temperature single crystal scattering experiments and different cooling rates, wich provide a unique way of investigating the Si\/Al order and resulting strain.","1137":"","1139":"","1140":"","1141":"","1143":"Carbon dioxide (CO2) was widely studied during the last years and despite its simple molecular form at ambient conditions, up to seven crystalline polymorphs of CO2 were reported experimentally, in addition to an amorphous form.

Here, we propose to in-situ single crystal x-ray diffraction study of CO2 at multi megabar pressure in diamond anvil cells. The samples of solid carbon dioxide will be studied after in house laser heating in temperature range up to 5000K and pressures 100-250 GPa and therefore we would like to establish its phase diagram and reveal new possible phases what are in great interest for chemical and geophysical science.","1144":"The experiment aims want to compare the combustion pyrometamorphism of limestone, which represents the natural analogous of cement production, and cement materials, by means of ex-situ and in-situ high-temperature Synchrotron X-Ray Powder Diffraction.\r\nCombustion pyrometamorphism is a poorly understood geological process involving sedimentary rocks in a first stage of high-temperature combustion , followed by a late hydration stage, leading the formation of natural analogous of anhydrous and hydrated cement, respectively.\r\nThe main focus of the experiment is to get accurate data on (i) mineral assemblages, (ii) crystallographic parameters (cell parameters, coherent domain size and microstrain), (iii) chemical reactions and (iv) phase transitions during heating of limestone.

However, the poor knowledge on the mechanisms of silica layer formation during silicate carbonation and the slow kinetics of this process affects significantly the effective implementation of CO2 capture and storage strategies. \r\nThis proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms of silica layer formation and the study of catalysis using biomimetic enzymes (MOF) in forsterite and wollastonite. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments will be performed to probe interfacial carbonation reactions. The results will be crucial to understand the structure-reactivity relationships in the minerals with the long-term goal of inhibiting passivating reactions and to design strategies for enhancing the carbonation step and its implementation as industrial process. \r\n","1146":"Rhenium (Re) is one of the rarest elements on Earth (average abundance < 1 ppb) and is of fundamental importance for our modern high-tech industry due to its high thermal stability (melting temperature beyond 3100 \u00b0C). Yet the enrichment process of Re in ore deposits is little understood mainly due to the difficulties to perform experiments at extremely high dilution levels and simultaneously at high P\/T conditions. The new ESRF-extremely brilliant source capabilities and several recent technical developments at the ESRF beamlines FAME and BM23 allow overcoming these limitations. We therefore propose to study systematically the solubility and speciation of Re in fluids as a function of P\/T and fluid composition using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) X-ray spectroscopy. The new data will improve our understanding of Re mobilization in magmatic systems and its enrichment process with implications for the exploration of Re.","1147":"Significantly, recently Pinter et al. (2015) suggested that siliceous eclogitic melt fractions are becoming trapped by a newly formed orthopyroxene reaction zone layer (RZL) through interactions between siliceous eclogitic melt fractions and ambient peridotitic mantle. When occurring along adiabatic mantle paths, this interaction process between eclogite and peridotite might be the cause of the existence of the low velocity zone (LVZ) observed globally in the Earth\u2019s upper mantle.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research intends, for the first time, to determine the effect upon compressional (VP) and shear wave velocities (VS) originating from the production of the sealed-off eclogitic melt fractions and RZL formation in mantle material containing discrete bodies of eclogite.

In our further investigations, by means of in situ HP SCXRD measurements, we plan to address elastic softening of feldspars in pre-transitional pressure range, hysteresis of the phase transitions, and amorphization mechanism of alkali feldspars. Our results will provide mineral physics contain on behaviour of one of the major components of cold and ultra-cold slabs and their seismic activity. ","1149":"The ubiquitous occurrence of Ca-Mg carbonates on Earth comes together with an intriguing paucity of (earth-)alkaline carbonatitic deposits probably due to the instability of minerals in the CaCO3-(Na,K)2CO3 system at ambient conditions and in presence of meteoric water. However, these minerals are of a great geological importance as possible lowering agents for mantle melting temperature. Moreover, Na-carbonate phases have been recently attributed to the so called \u201cbright spots\u201d on the surface of Ceres, a dwarf planet located on the asteroids belt. The present proposal is aimed to study by single crystal X-ray diffraction the crystal structure evolution of the anhydrous nyerereite [Na2Ca(CO3)2] and the highly water content form, gaylussite [Na2Ca(CO3)2\u00b75H2O], at high pressure and high to low temperature conditions.

This project focuses on the study of unstable fluid propagation within porous reservoir rock material, which is pivotal in the loss of sealing capacity of underground storages. In particular, we are interested in the fast bifurcation phenomenon known as fluid fingering that occurs when an invasive fluid percolates within a porous medium. To get an in-depth understanding that will potentially allow mitigating these instabilities, it is paramount to investigate fluid fingering in 4D (3D + time) within representative conditions. Preliminary results confirm that it is possible to reproduce and record the fingering phenomena. The future experiments at ESRF will allow for the first time worldwide quantitative characterization of rapid fingering development in geomaterials.","1151":"Serpentinization, hydration of the oceanic crust, has strong implications for both the physical properties of\r\nthe crust and the long-term global carbon cycle. We previously reproduced at the ESRF the serpentinization process experimentally both to understand the coupled chemical and physical processes involved and to constrain its impact on the strength of oceanic crust. We wish now to listen to the exact same process, record the acoustic emission produced at the different steps of the process and compare them with a large-scale experiment within the Oman desert where mega-hertz acoustic sensors have been deployed.

Therefore, laboratory experiments were developed in the past 50 years to reproduce and study laboratory earthquakes to unravel the mechanisms of rock deformation prior and during seismic slip. However, all experiments are limited by that fact that is it not possible to measure at the same time the seismic and aseismic components of deformation and image the interior of the samples as the microstructure evolves toward brittle failure. We have developed a new rock deformation apparatus, the KORE rig, installed on beamline ID19 at ESRF, which couples X-ray tomography and acoustic emission recording while reproducing conditions of temperature and stress at 10 km depth. We plan to rock deformation experiments using the KORE apparatus to elucidate the real-time fault propagation in 3D rock samples and so characterize the link between delocalized faulting, and slow and fast slip events.","1154":"The main goal of this proposal is to characterize the propagation of shock waves into porous rocks either in the presence water or under dry conditions to better understand damage produced during earthquake rupture.

Demonstrating such a diagenetic evolution will require to identify and quantitatively determine U species as a function of depth in sediment cores that have been already sampled and carefully preserved from oxidation. This goal can only be achieved by using EXAFS spectroscopy at the U LIII-edge analyzed using linear combination of reference compound spectra.

Because of this, their production can lead to their release into the environment and produce undesirable effects on human health and ecosystems. One of the main means in which these particles are released into the environment is by wastewater, ending up in the sewage sludge from treatment plants.  Already was demonstrated that the sludge from wastewater treatment plants in Chihuahua, M\u00e9xico contains TiO2-NPs, and this sludge is applied as an amendment in agricultural fields of alfalfa. This study aims at determining the tissue specific (and sub-celullar) localization of Ti, and to confirm the presence of TiO2-NPs in alfalfa leaf from plants obtained from sludge amended fields and laboratory exposed plants in hydroponic medium.

In many tropical soils P is often present only in very low concentrations due to its strongly interaction with the soil\u2019s mineral phase. Thus, P fertilization in these soils is mandatory for biomass production. However, the strong interaction of P with soil's mineral phase result in a very low P use efficiency by the plants. To improve the use efficiency of such resource understanding its fate and behavior in the plant-soil system is of pivotal importance to improve our sustainability. This works aims to evaluate the long-term changes on soil P fractions and fertilizer fate in conventional tillage and native soils in the tropical soils of Brazil. To unravel these changes we aim to combine sequential chemical fractionation techniques (Hedley`s procedure) with state-of-the-art methods used for P speciation, P K-edge XANES and 31P-NMR.","1168":"Coccolitophores are abundant unicellular phytoplanktons that produce calcium carbonate exoskeletons. They are major players in the carbon cycle. They live in surface layers of the sea, where they use light to photosynthesize, fixing CO2 into organic matter leading to a decrease in dissolved CO2 in the ocean. Coccolithophores produce calcite (i.e. CaCO3) in the form of minute platelets called\r\n\u201ccoccoliths\u201d. These platelets are formed by tiny elements so well-entangled that they confer to the coccoliths their integrity. The main issue of this proposal is to unravel the shape of these elements with a resolution better than 10nm so that we could unravel how they act as self-blocking agents. In addition as a challenging test experiment, we want to study (if time permits it)  frozen coccospheres to understand how the protococcoliths are formed inside the membrane of the coccospheres. We expect to image the nucleus on which protococcoliths are formed.","1169":"Actinide nanoparticles are raising considerable concern in the field of safe nuclear waste disposal. It has been demonstrated that actinide nanoparticles are a mean of geochemical transport of radioactive material in natural aquatic systems. Currently, the chemistry and reactivity of actinide nanoparticles is very poorly known and the present proposal looks in the direction of filling this gap. ThO2 is used as model for AnO2 and is the reasonable system to start with. The objective of this measurement campaign will be to investigate the formation mechanism of ThO2 nanoparticles prepared by solution chemistry by thoroughly characterizing the structure of the products formed during the precipitation process. We will investigate the influence of thorium stock solution concentration, pH, post-synthesis thermal treatment and aging on ThO2 nanoparticles size and crystallinity. The results will shed light on the synthesis conditions that favor nanoparticle formations and growth.","1170":"Organic wastes produced on R\u00e9union island exceed the French total chromium (Cr) standard values for their sales as soil amendment. Accordingly, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (Anses) explicitly required additional information about the distinction between CrIII\/CrVI in the edible parts of market gardening and forage crops grown on soils amended with organic wastes. XAS is an ideal probe to determine the oxidation state of Cr in plant matrix. We propose to use High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) to characterize the speciation of Cr in plants samples with \u201cnatural Cr levels\u201d collected from field and laboratory experiments. The first objectives consists in producing sound data about Cr speciation in staple food required by authorities.

The RE concentration in acid mine drainage (AMD) is significantly high, and RE are retained in the solids that precipitated during AMD remediation (i.e., schwertmannite). This study aims to understand how the changes in the solution parameters affect the retention mechanism between RE and schwertmannite. High affinity between RE and schwertmannite has been described, where RE are retained in the solid structure by bidentate binding. However, our recently performed desorption experiments exhibit a potential monodentate binding in light RE, in which a higher desorption reaction was observed. We propose RE EXAFS experiments on RE-enriched schwertmannite before and after desorption experiments. The results will shed light in the effectiveness of remediation treatments in areas contaminated by AMD and the feasibility of extraction of RE from the treatment residuals in passive remediation plants.","1172":"Reclamation of abandoned sulfidic mine tailings is challenging because these tailings, typically weathered under oxic conditions for decades, generate acid mine drainage (AMD) even after covering with oxygen barriers. Indirect oxidation due to Fe(III)-bearing secondary phases is suspected to be responsible for the poor efficiency of usual reclamation strategies. However, experimental investigation lacking to confirm that such processes are determining the patterns of mine drainage composition after reclamation. We initiated a study of the anoxic leaching of weathered sulfidic tailings from the Doyon mine, Canada, and the Folldal mine, Norway. This proposal aims at using Fe K-edge EXAFS to characterize the secondary, poorly crystalline Fe-species occurring in the initial tailings, as well as Fe-species formed after leaching under anoxic conditions. Speciation modelling will be used to test hypotheses about the reactions involved and predict the generation and composition of AMD.

We propose to use tomographic imaging at energies both above and below the Sr edge of 16.105 eV as well as by high-energy phase contrast enhanced microCT. We will create Sr-edge difference tomographis to visualize and study juvenile growth patterns across diel cycles. This information will help elucidate fundamental aspects of mineral accretion in these ecologically critical animals","1174":"Large amounts of contaminant metals (such as Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn) are present in the Fe-rich mining tailings of the Rio Doce estuary (Brazil), after the rupture disaster of the upstream Fund\u00e3o tailings dam. The Fe oxides from the tailings may undergo reductive dissolution at the redox dynamic estuary and potentially release the associated metals and cause contamination. Aiming to explore the potential mechanisms of metal release in the estuary, we performed a 20-d lab redox oscillation experiment exposing the mining tailings to three different redox conditions that prevail in the estuary (static anoxic, static oxic, and redox oscillation). We collected samples at the beginning and at the end of the experiment for each treatment and performed the sample characterization for Fe and Mn. Our objective is to use \u00b5XRF and \u00b5XANES to study the adsorption stability and mapping of Mn onto the Fe-rich mining tailings when exposed different redox conditions that naturally occur at the estuary.","1177":"Very high concentrations of Vanadium (V)(up to 3 wt%) were reported for the first time in the Mediterranean homoscleromorph sponges Oscarella lobularis and Oscarella Tuberculata used as bioindicators of metallic contamination in the Marseille Bay area. This unexpected discovery raises a lot of questions regarding bioaccumulation and bioconcentration mechanisms as well as the physiological role of V in these sponges. Here we propose to investigate V speciation using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the V K-edge to explore bioaccumulation mechanisms. In particular, redox state of V will be studied since it has been shown to control its bioaccumulation in other marine organisms such as ascidians. Finally, at longer term, the comprehension of V bioconcentration mechanisms may open unique opportunities for developing biomimetic approach for the selective extraction of V from secondary sources.

This study focuses i) to investigate the dynamics of Se speciation and reservoirs in this soil in relation to a) the seasonal rice-wheat crop rotation and b) the crop residue burning, and ii) to explore biochar as a soil amendment to reduce the plant bioavailability of Se in the soil. The first objective will be addressed by Se and Fe K-edge XANES analysis of natural soil samples collected from the field at different rice and wheat cultivation stages. The second objective will be addressed by performing laboratory batch experiments for selenate and selenite sorption onto rice straw biochar, followed by Se K-edge EXAFS analysis of the biochar. This study will develop our understanding of Se cycling under the fluctuating redox conditions and the possible role of temperature in the process. It will also contribute to developing mitigation measures for reducing Se toxicity in regions with seleniferous soils.","1179":"Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) is a widespread technology for MSW treatment, but one of its drawbacks is the production of solid residues: bottom ash (BA) and fly ash (FA). They are characterized by high amounts of chlorides and leachable heavy metals, which limit their potential recycle as secondary raw materials (SRM). In this light, we propose to investigate the speciation of Cu, Zn and Pb, which affects their behaviour as leachable species. Such heavy metals represent some of the commonest source of pollution. We aim to exploit XAS, especially in the XANES region, to get insight into Cu\/Zn\/Pb speciation, using suitable reference minerals. All this is to understand why a novel pre-treatment, i.e. steam washing, is effective in reducing the release of these metals, and to design further developments. The scientific issue of the present investigation is a contribution to valorize such materials towards a general enhancement of the principle of sustainability of our society.","1182":"Tropical soils are often highly weathered, presenting poor nutritional conditions for plant growth. In these soils, \r\nphosphorus (P) is not only depleted, but the remaining P is often not bioavailable as most of the soil P is strongly adsorbed to mineral phases. Under such low accessibility, the productivity of tropical plants is strained, and they need to compete or cooperate with soil microorganisms at the microscale to acquire P from the soil. This acquisition is almost exclusively dependent on the exudation of organic compounds into the soil, that liberate P for the plants. To investigate the effect of different organic compounds on soil P microspatial patterns and speciation, we have conducted a 13C-enrichment microdialysis experiment, which simulates root exudation into the soil. To unravel the correlative relationship between exudates, microorganisms and P we propose the combination of fluorescence microscopy with synchrotron SXM and NanoSIMS.\r\n","1183":"Lignin is one the most abundant biopolymers and has due to its sustainability and accessibility generated interest in industrial as well as research communities. Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged within the past few years as a promising type of colloidal materials for applications ranging from coatings and composites to biomedical adhesives.1 While ex situ data has given some insight in the growth mechanism of LNPs, in situ measurements have not been performed before. We thus aim on elucidating the growth mechanism of LNPs using time-resolved SAXS data. We intend to extract information on molecular arrangement, packing density, and porosity of LNPs.","1184":"We aim at deciphering the physico-chemical mechanisms at play during biomineralization, exploiting the unique growth specificity of pearls. While pearls present complex structures (CaCO3 polymorphs and micro-structures), they form in a single, enclosed cellular environment, the pearl sac, which produces a set of organic molecules and controls the physico-chemical parameters of the media. From a previous 3D ptycho tomo experiment, we already obtained the 3D density distribution of a full pearl sample set. Here, we want to map out, in the very same samples, the 3D crystalline properties with x-ray nanodiffraction. This shall provide a unique mean to assess the recently proposed oriented solidification micro-structural growth model. Using 3D bragg ptychography, we will further identify the nature of the crystalline transition, in the different micro-structures, and compare it to recent crystallisation models, finally enabling new synthetic routes for bioinspired hierarchical materials.","1185":"The development of after-treatment catalysts for internal combustion engines remains of great importance. This is because, despite the shifting focus to more carbon-neutral technologies, there is a growing demand for diesel cars in developing countries as well as a high demand for heavy-duty trucks.\r\nOver the last 20 yeasr, Cu-CHA catalysts have dominated the aftertreatment technology market for diesel exhaust systems. With upcoming legislation putting restriction on levels of N2O - a greenhouse gas - for the first time, the low N2O formation on Fe-modified zeolites make them particularly desirable for new technologies. There is, however, some way to go before Fe-modified zeolites can measure up to Cu-CHA, particularly in the low temperature window.\r\nUnderstanding the active Fe species required for low temperature SCR reactivity is paramount to developing the new technologies. The speciation information obtained by HERFD-XANES measurements will provide this much needed insight.","1186":"The retreat of permafrost in mountain terrains exposes fresh sulfide minerals to atmospheric conditions, which induce their oxidation and subsequent formation of acid rock drainage rich in Al and sulfate. At pH higher than 4.5, basaluminite exerts a strong solubility control on dissolved toxic Al and has been described as a highly efficient scavenger for toxic As. However, it has been shown that the SO4 content in basaluminite is variable due to a substitution with OH, highlighting a possible solid solution between basaluminite and nanoboehmite. The structural changes associated with this solid solution may affect the As adsorption behavior. We propose HEXD experiments with both natural and synthetic basaluminite samples to determinate how the pH and temperature during precipitation affect their nanomineral structure. This analysis will help to obtain a more predictive understanding of the mobility of toxic elements such as As and Al under changing alpine climatic conditions.","1187":"Structural defects in nanomaterials can be useful for the incorporation, in the structure, of alien cations of different sizes. Using nanomaterials for the adsorption of heavy metals from liquid phases is then easy, especially because they can easily be separated, analysed and recycled in a circular economy view. Iron oxides are particularly interesting because they can be readily used, provided that the heavy metals are strongly bond into the structure, so that they cannot be released in the environment. The nature of the bond between the heavy metals and these nanomaterials is still largely unknown and it is the main purpose of this proposal, together with the thermal stability of these bonds (and of these materials as a whole).","1188":"Rare Earth Elements (RE) are critical raw materials which are essential for modern technologies. The RE concentrations in AMD are significantly high and are retained in the solid precipitated from AMD (i.e., schwertmannite). This study aims to understand how the changes in the physical-chemical parameters in solution affect the retention mechanism of RE in schwertmannite, a poorly crystalline Fe oxyhydroxide sulfate. High affinity between RE and schwertmannite has been described, where RE are retained by double covalent bonding. However, our desorption experiments exhibit a potential single covalent bonding in light RE, together with stronger desorption. We propose a HEXD experiment with RE-enriched schwertmannite experiments to determine how physical-chemical conditions affect the structure in schwertmannite and the bonding with RE. The results will shed light on the effectiveness of the natural attenuation and remediation treatments and the feasibility of extraction of RE from waste.","1189":"The WWF reserve \"Oasi di Alviano\" in Central Italy includes most of the wetland habitats and hosts numerous plant and animal species.

The objective is to fill the gap in fundamental knowledge of the Cr speciation in plants at low but environmentally-relevant range of concentrations. Indeed, it is well known that plant can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), but our preliminary results achieved on a single sample tend to show that plant can also reduce Cr(III) to Cr(0). This result is new and need to be confirmed on a larger set of plant samples.

In addition to being more efficient, they will help avoid the contamination of agricultural soils in toxic elements found in conventional fertilizers. However, it remains unclear how foliar-applied NP fertilizers are assimilated into the leaves, and how the nutrients they deliver are used by the crops. Here, we designed a Fe based NP fertilizer to deliver Fe, a crucial nutrient that is often depleted in agricultural soils, and for which plants have developed two acquisition strategies. We propose to follow the fate of foliar-applied Fe from FeNP in two edible plants (tomato, type I, Fe redox-based and wheat, type II, Fe3+ complexation-based) using a multi-technique approach. By combining Fe K-edge XANES and EXAFS measurements with Fe isotopic measurements, we will track the pathways and mechanisms that affect Fe from foliar-applied FeNP fertilizer in our plants.","1193":"CeO2 is used in many catalysis applications due to its extraordinary capacity to storage oxygen. The atomic-scale structure plays a major role in solid state diffusivity and chemical reactivity, which are determinant factors in the performance and stability of catalysts. We synthesized new Ce-based metallic glass catalysts, in which Ce atoms are found in a disordered, defective structure with high free volume. These materials have shown outstanding performance, with possible application in purifying the hydrogen streams feeding fuel cells. We propose to collect XANES and EXAFS measurements to study the coordination and local structure of Ce atoms in the metallic glass and in the oxide generated during catalysis. Different compositions and structural states will be probed to find the relationship between the structure of the parent disordered metals and the Ce oxide catalysts, thus unveiling the specific features responsible of the high catalytic activity discovered in these materials.","1195":"The new EU regulation on cadmium (Cd) concentration in cocoa-derived products affects the cocoa market worldwide, especially in Latin-America, and requires the development of mitigation strategies. Plant breeding to produce low Cd-accumulating cocoa cultivars is one of them. However, this strategy requires a much better understanding and control of the physiological pathways of Cd uptake, translocation and accumulation in the beans. The various plant parts (root, branch, leaves and bean) of a cacao tree were sampled in the field and investigated in a combined approach (elemental analyses, Cd stable isotope analyses, bulk XANES spectroscopy and LA ICP MS imaging). We identified the branches and the leaves as the major storage compartments for Cd. To test their role as a sink, but also as a source of Cd for the bean, we wish to determine the Cd distribution and speciation in these tissues using \u00b5XRF and \u00b5XANES. ","1196":"The aim of this proposal is to follow up on the biomineralization process in the coral Stylophora pistillata (Sp) in vivo, to provide decisive crystalline information regarding the dynamics of the amorphous\/crystalline transformation and the mechanism by which the alignment of formed crystallites into a large, high-quality single crystal is achieved. These open questions can only be answered with in vivo studies, which we recently successfully established at ID13 (see Exp. Rep. EV-395), collecting fascinating preliminary data on biomineralization. By performing spatially resolved fluorescence (XRF), Bragg diffraction and 3D Bragg ptychography (3DBP) in vivo, we shall access to Ca distribution, strain, tilts and crystalline coherence maps of a crystallizing Sp skeletons, providing a unique comprehensive picture of the transformation of the initial amorphous phase into a large final single crystal.","1197":"The present study aims at unravelling arsenic (As) speciation in the total suspended particulate (TSP) occurring at the Carletti spring system (CSS), part of the larger Bullicame (Viterbo, Central Italy) system, by means of XAS spectroscopy. Here, As occurs as a geogenic anomaly, and its mobility is affected by inorganic and microbiological processes which can differentiate its speciation and mobility. The determination of As speciation in the TSP, highly diluted samples, is essential to validate the models on the fate of As in this \u201cnatural laboratory\u201d.","1199":"The use of concrete has been growing continuously in the 20th and 21st centuries. The manufacture of cement, the \u2018glue\u2019 in concrete, is associated with significant CO2 emissions accounting for ~ 7% of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the world. The current global warming crisis have pushed the building industry to search for new and sustainable solutions. New breakthrough technologies for lowering the CO2 footprint include a circular utilization of demolished concrete. This technology, currently under development by the cement industry, consists in the reactions between the hydraulic cement components and their hydration products with carbonate ions (from the injected CO2) in an aqueous medium, which lead to the formation of carbonate minerals and therefore to the permanent storage of the CO2 in solid form. Here, we aim to understand the carbonate mineral formation pathways in the complex environment of a recycled cement paste using in situ PDF analyses of total scattering data.","1200":"We aim to clarify the binding mechanisms of heavy metals (HM) to cyanobacteria exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the biosorption process, which is an innovative, eco-friendly method for HM bioremoval. To our knowledge, the speciation of HM on different EPS fractions has not been investigated yet. For this purpose, the binding between anionic groups of i) released polysaccharides (RPS) and ii) EPS that are associated with the cells surface of cyanobacteria (biosorbents) to Ni, Cu, Zn, and Au will be studied via both XANES and EXAFS techniques. Thanks to its elemental specificity and low detection limit, XAS spectroscopy represents the most suitable method to obtain information on the local atomic structure of the metals biosorbed to heterogeneous biological samples. The obtained data will provide a characterization of the metal-organic materials obtained through this process.","1201":"Rare Earth Elements (RE) are critical raw materials which are essential for modern technologies. The RE concentration in AMD is significantly high, and RE are retained in the solids that precipitated in AMD (i.e., schwertmannite). This study aims to understand how the changes in the physical-chemical parameters in solution affect the retention mechanism between RE and schwertmannite, the poorly crystalline Fe oxyhydroxide sulfate. High affinity between RE and schwertmannite has been described, where RE are retained in the solid structure by double covalent bonding. However, our recently performed desorption experiments exhibit a potential single covalent bonding in light RE. We propose La L3-edge and Gd L3-edge HERFD EXAFS experiments on RE-enriched schwertmannite to determine how physical-chemical conditions affect the RE retention. The results will shed light in the effectiveness of contaminant attenuation process and the feasibility of extraction of RE from schwertmannite.","1202":"Vineyard soils are generally contaminated with copper (Cu) due to the use of Cu-based fungicides, even in organic viticulture. Phytoremediation can represent an alternative to extract part of Cu from these soils. After a screening of local plants, we have selected two plant species that were grown in pot experiments. The objective of this proposal is to identify Cu speciation in soils and in the various plant organs by EXAFS. This information will be essential to 1) determine the strategy developed by the plant to cope with Cu toxicity, and 2) take the first steps of phytoextraction and Cu recovering.","1203":"The aim of this study is to build a link between spatial and temporal aspects of adaptation of microalgae to metal pollution. We want to draw a route of movement of Mn and Ni ions between extracellular barriers and organelles in Chlorella cells in the course of response to Mn and Ni excess. XRF is essential for intracellular metal mapping because it enables the localization of Mn and Ni through the identification of cellular compartments according to the known distribution of elements (P, Ca, Fe, Cl, S, Zn). The understanding of mechanisms of adaptation will help the development of microalgae-based biotechnologies for wastewater treatment and metal recovery.","1204":"Previous results by our lab and others have shown that plants use zinc to fend-off pathogens. However, the molecular bases of this response and how it is elicited have not been defined yet, an important aspect when considering their possible use in crop pathogen-management strategies. In this proposal, we would like to use the X-ray fluorescence capabilities at ID21 to determine how different immune response-triggering molecules affect the local zinc accumulation characteristic of the zinc-mediated immune (ZiMI) response. This will be an important step in our current studies on how ZiMI response is initiated and how it integrates in the more canonical plant immune response pathways.","1205":"Vineyard soils are generally contaminated with copper (Cu) due to the use of Cu-based fungicides, even in organic viticulture. Phytoremediation can represent an alternative to extract part of Cu from these soils. After a screening of local plants, we have selected two plant species that were grown in pot experiments. The objective of this proposal is to identify the compartments of Cu accumulation in the various organs, tissues and cells of the plants by micro X-ray fluorescence (\u00b5XRF), and the Cu speciation by micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (\u00b5XANES). This information will be essential to 1) determine the strategy developed by the plant to cope with Cu toxicity, and 2) take the first steps of phytoextraction and Cu recovering.","1206":"Sargassum algae accumulate a high concentration of arsenic, posing a serious threat to pollute coastal ecosystems. The process of As accumulation, distribution and metabolization in algae cells needs to be understood in order to assess the toxicity and the environmental effects. Preliminary results indicate heterogeneous distribution of the arsenic in the cell, with high arsenic accumulation on cell walls. However, the form in which arsenic binds to the wall is not inferred from only bulk speciation. Thus, we aim to characterize the As speciation in the cell compartments of Sargassum algae, focusing on the differences in species between the cell walls and the cell internal organelles, to elucidate the mechanisms of As binding and storage. Moreover, the As speciation during the seaweed degradation will be studied by comparing samples collected from the open sea and from the stockpiled in the beach, which will make possible to assess the As potential environmental effects.","1207":"The release of Fe and Al from weathering of sulfide-bearing ores deposits and their host rocks leads to the formation of metastable nano-crystalline mineral phases such as schwertmannite and basaluminite. Both have been described as scavenger of potentially toxic elements (i.e., As and Cu) in solution, due to their high and charger surface area. However, this surface properties can be affected by impurity incorporation during precipitation processes. Recent titration and HEXD experiments showed that a limited Al incorporation in schwertmannite structure, strongly affected the surface coordination in sorbed arsenate. Here we propose a HEXD experiment where synthetic schwertmannite and basaluminite will be co-precipitated with Al and Si, respectively, at several pH. In addition, we aim to perform differential d-PDF analysis of arsenate adsorbed on pure and impure phases to probe the effect of impurities in the nano-mineral structure and its surface properties.","1208":"Iron oxides can be used for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water-based solutions of various origin. They seem to be efficient (particularly when the grain size is in the nano-region), with a good retention behaviour. They can be produced from metallic scrap materials, and be re-used in the steel industry as smelting aids, keeping in mind a circular economy view.\r\nThe relationship between structure and properties, however, is still largely unknown. The aim of these series of proposals (this is the second one) is to understand which is the structural role of heavy metals in the iron oxides, and, from a reaction kinetics point of view, to evaluate fully the kinetics of the process of formation of the iron oxides and of the adsorption of the heavy metals.","1209":"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a strong neurotoxin and is mainly produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the environment. However, the mechanisms of Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation are still poorly understood. We study the model SRB strain Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri BerOc1 and we have generated BerOc1 mutants impaired with a metal efflux system and with a two-component sensing system involved in Hg regulation, and probably Hg sequestration. These mutants showed specific phenotypes in Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation. Our objective is to identify and quantify the various Hg species in the wildtype and mutants upon Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation. For that, we will use Hg L3-edge High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected -X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) from FAME-UHD beamline that proved powerful to determine Hg species at relevant environmental levels","1210":"We propose to study how methylmercury is detoxified in the muscles of dolphins from the east coast of Florida. The identity and proportions of the Hg species will be obtained using Hg L3-edge HERFD-XANES spectroscopy, and the metabolic demethylation pathways will be obtained by inverting the Hg speciation and the 202Hg and 198Hg isotopic data. Results will allow us to assess if the animals suffer from Hg toxicity, which typically impair swimming bahavior and their survival.","1211":"The proposed experiment will investigate the electronic structure of Uranium (U) in a wide range of environmentally relevant species as solid and adsorbed species using U M4, M5 edge high energy-resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). U(VI), (V) and (IV) samples will be synthesised with a range of environmentally relevant ligands e.g. oxide, silicate and phosphate. The HERFD-XANES and RIXS spectra will be collected and analysed to determine how these techniques and approaches can be applied to determine U speciation in complex environmental systems. The results from HERFD-XANES and RIXS measurements will be supported by ligand field theory calculations to deepen our understanding of variations in the electronic structure of U in environmentally relevant samples. ","1213":"The black coral antipatharians Stichopathes sp. live in a range of habitats of extreme depths in different seas worldwide. They form coiled wires, that are poorly mineralized yet they posses a hard and extremely damage resilient chitin-based skeleton that is largely unexplored. The coral exhibits extraordinary  toughness making it very difficult to break, presumably needed for life in the harsh habitat. We propose to study the relation between chitin fibers, cavities and internal architecture and forces needed to deform and fracture the coral, measured by in-situ 3 point bending on ID19, to be able to image the tension and compression sides of specimens exposed to increasing loads. With energies above 75 keV we will avoid radiation damage and directly visualize internal damage arresting structures at micrometer resolution. This will shed light on damage resistant mechanisms that evolved under environmental conditions that are very different than those found on land.","1214":"Vineyard soils are contaminated with copper (Cu) due to the use of Cu-based fungicides, even in organic viticulture. Phytoremediation can represent an alternative to extract part of Cu from these soils. After a screening of local plants in a vineyard, two plant species with high level of Cu in their aerial parts have been identified. The objective of this proposal is to focus on plants collected on the site to identify the mechanisms involved in Cu accumulation. For that, Cu chemical imaging by micro X-ray fluorescence (\u00b5XRF), and Cu speciation by micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (\u00b5XANES) will be combined. This information will be essential to determine the strategy developed by the plant to cope with Cu toxicity.","1215":"Hydrogen (H2) gas production leading to corrosion of steel canisters containing nuclear waste is one of the greatest concerns regarding the safety of future deep geological repositories. As a safety parameter, microbial H2 consumption is proposed to be an effective H2 sink in repository sand\/bentonite backfill. H2 metabolism can be coupled, for instance, to sulfate reduction, producing hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is highly corrosive; therefore, the question becomes whether microbial activity resulting in sulfide production could negatively impact canister safety. Sulfide readily reacts with ferrous iron to produce iron-sulfide minerals. Understanding iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) cycling in backfill material is critical to predicting the mobility of dissolved hydrogen sulfide. We propose to use X-ray absorption to study S and Fe speciation in a backfill material, after incubation with native microorganisms and hydrogen.","1216":"Coralline red algae are marine calcifiers that precipitate CaCO3 during their life in both calcite and aragonite phases with variable Mg\r\ncontent. These sediments constitute the habitats for several ecosystems (i.e. coral reef) and are endangered by ocean acidification; thus representing an urgent and relevant iissue. The Mg\/Ca ratio is an established temperature proxy for climate reconstructions. At the macro-scale, the growth reveals a banding pattern, with fluctuations in Mg\/Ca related to seasonal fluctuation; at the micro-scale, the skeletal parts show specific ultrastructures (i.e. in the different calcified layers in the cell walls). It is still not clear how biomineralization and Mg incorporation take place. We propose the spatially resolved diffraction investigation of five samples of coralline red algae at the micro and nanoscale. The goal of the proposed experiment is to disclose the mechanism of the biomineralization, cast light on the actual Mg distribution and its role.","1217":"Pyrochlores and hollandites are minerals featuring tunnel-like cavities within which a wide variety of cations can be hosted. Preliminary experiments (XRPD and ICP-OES on residual liquid) revealed that such structures can incorporate Tl, Pb and Zn. We want to obtain accurate structural information, minimizing the absorption effects of the samples, with the purpose to investigate the incorporation mechanisms of Tl, Pb and Zn within the crystal lattice and the effects induced by the ionic exchanges on the average and local structure. Therefore, we will collect XRPD pattens using high energy radiation on both treated and untreated samples. In the perspective of using pyrochlores and hollandites for wastewater decontamination, this investigation will provide useful information on the capacity of such materials to incorporate heavy metals from aqueous matrices. ","1218":"The fate of technetium (Tc) in the environment is of great concern due to its inherent radioactivity, being a hazardous material for living organisms. Tc is especially mobile as Tc(VII), but its migration is limited when it is reduced to Tc(IV) by electrochemical methods or by reductants e.g., Fe(II). Furthermore, the migration of Tc depends on the aqueous chemical speciation and the interaction of Tc with surfaces such as minerals or microorganisms. Our proposal is focused in two directions.\r\nFirst, we have studied the redox aqueous chemistry of Tc carbonates. For the first time, we have observed the presence of Tc(V)-carbonate by Tc-99 NMR. We want to determine its structure by XAS.\r\nSecond, we have studied the immobilitzation of Tc by vivianite (Fe(II)-phosphate). The vivianites used in the experiments were synthetically and biogenically produced. We want to decipher the mechanism responsible of Tc immobilization, that might be influenced by pH due to mineral transfromation.","1219":"\ufffcHeterogeneous Fenton-like reactions using airborne O2 as sole oxidant are gaining a fast-growing interest to eliminate organic contaminant in soils and groundwaters. At BM23 beamline, we will quantify the redox states of iron using Fe K-edge XANES spectroscopy in reactive Fe(II)-nanominerals previously subjected to reduction\/oxidation experiments mimicking redox fluctuations at natural redox boundaries (water-table in soils and floodplains). We will also determine the evolution of the local structure around iron after redox cycling steps, using Fe K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy. Redox and structural information gained on the reactive Fe mineral substrates will be directly compared with the amount of radical species measured by EPR-spin trapping (see Figure) and to degradation rates of priority pollutants (HAP, pesticides) measured by ECOSYS\/INRAE in similar redox cycling experiments. This study is supported by ANR project DEPOLECO (2022\u20132025) and is a main part of two PhDs.\r\n","1220":"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a strong neurotoxin and is mainly produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in anoxic environments. However, the mechanisms of Hg methylation are still poorly understood. We study the model SRB strain Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri BerOc1 and we have generated BerOc1 mutants impaired with a metal efflux system and with a two-component sensing system involved in Hg regulation, and probably Hg sequestration. These mutants showed specific phenotypes in Hg methylation. Our objective is to clarify the role of these genes in Hg distribution at the cell level. For that, we will image single cells from wild type and mutants by nano X-ray fluorescence (nano-XRF) ","1221":"Sea urchin spines possess intricate 3D structures, combining strength and flexibility. These remarkable properties arise from a unique composition, including varying magnesium distribution and amorphous material. By subjecting the spines to mild heat treatments, previous research showed changes in flexibility, suggesting the role of compositional variations. Our proposed study employs nanotomography and in-situ annealing to track temperature-induced alterations in spine morphology and microstructure. Detecting density changes may reveal the crystallization of amorphous particles and shed light on non-uniform magnesium distribution. This investigation deepens our understanding of sea urchin spine mechanics, offering insights for bio-inspired materials.","1222":"We aim to study a new biotechnological process based on metal biosorption by cyanobacteria and valorization of metal-enriched organic materials (e.g., catalysts). Since heterogeneous systems like biomaterials may provide multiple binding or accumulation sites for metals, nano-XRF and nano-XANES measurements may increase the knowledge of the uptake mechanisms as well as characterize the materials obtained at the end of the process at a lower spatial scale providing information on localization, accessibility and properties of the metals. We will study the location and the chemical forms of three different metals in 7 samples comparing multi-metal interactions and evaluating the effect of a sequential addition of metals since we have already observed a positive effect on Cu uptake by Zn and Ni. ID21 beamline has all the characteristics for a successful turnout of the experiment: a nano-SXM for 2D nano-XRF and nano-XANES ( 2-11 keV) that can be used in vacuum and cryo conditions. ","1223":"After nuclear accident, non-soluble radioactive particles serve as an additional source for human exposure to radioactivity, when transferred to agricultural\r\ncrops. The foliar transfer mechanisms of such source into plants are poorly assessed by risk assessment tools which includes retention, incorporation and\r\ntranslocation. The transfer is tuned as a function of plant and particles interaction. Thus, properties of particles like size and charge, and those of plants like\r\nstomatal size, leaf hairs and cuticle thickness will determine fluxes distributed on and within plant, that would be able to translocate later.\r\nTherefore, because of the lack of data regarding the transfer of non-soluble particle, CeO2 particle with relevant size range (10 nm- 50 nm and 460 nm) will be\r\nused as proxy to non-reactive particles for plants exposure. This approach will allow us to identify the location and speciation of particles using multi-X-ray techniques like \u03bcXRF and \u03bcXANES on the ID21 beamline.","1224":"Phosphate-based organo-mineral fertilizer technology has performed better than conventional fertilizers in several trials. We hypothesize that the organic phase in the pellet is: i) controlling P release; ii) preventing inner pellet P precipitation; ii) and bocking the P adsorption sites in the soil. We propose to employ the \u03bc-XRF and \u03bc-XANES techniques available at ID21 to investigate the P physical-chemical dynamics within and around the fertilizer pellet. The high sensititivity chemical maps recorded at a micrometer spatial resolution, combined with the P chemical speciation will  allow us to test the above raised hypotheses, provide insights on the working mechanisms, and help to stablish a rational roadmap to improve this green and sustainable technology. ","1225":"Stony corals grow in seawater, where they successfully isolate Ca to precipitate CaCO3 mineral, mostly in the form of aragonite however Sr is often incorporated in small amounts in the skeleton, possibly alongside amorphous mineral. Previous low-resolution XRF mapping on mySpot with a 20 \u00b5m diameter beam did not provide sufficient information on the spatial distribution of Sr in relation to the mineral deposits. We propose to use the nm-sized beam of ID21 and to excite XRF L lines of Sr to image the distribution of Sr and within Ca in newly forming corals, grown under different Sr water concentrations. The low energy of Sr L edge excitation (ca. 1805 eV) will help us pinpoint where this element is found. This information will help characterize zones of primary polyp growth important to understand fundamental aspects of coral biomineralization in which the stable mineral phases formed are not fully understood.","1226":"Incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a growing waste management strategy in Europe, but this method produces ash that has traditionally been viewed as a disposal issue due to its high content of potentially toxic metal(loids), including antimony (Sb). However, Sb has now been classified as a Critical Raw Material (CRM) in the EU (and US, among other regions), which provides new motivation to recover Sb from different waste streams. This proposal aims to collect Sb K-edge XAS data of a comprehensive set of fly ash samples collected from key areas of one of the EU\u2019s largest MSW incinerators. This knowledge is essential to optimize recovery methods (i.e., selective leaching) that target different solid-phase Sb species in the fly ash, which can help create local sources of valuable CRMs from this waste. ","1227":"Non-metallic, inorganic large brittle structures are not usually interesting for their (rather poor) mechanical properties, however in nature, corals create large mineral structures that are impressively resilient against cyclic wave and tide forces. But how do coral features: struts, polyps, density and phase achieve this? We propose an in situ study in OD19 combining mechanical microindentation with high-energy radiography and tomography, to reveal interactions between indenter, microstructure and cracks, to reveal how the structure resists damage propagation. We will reveal how corals resist cracking and we will explore the interplay between porosity, shape and variable density domains in the struts and corralites. With this we hope to reveal motifs and principles of crack stopping, inspired by the coral system.","1228":"The aim of this continuation is to complete the spatial and temporal aspects of adaptation of microalgae to Mn and Ni pollution. The process of uptake of Mn has been examined during the proposal EV-529.  Now,  our objective is to understand the trajectory of Ni ion movement between extracellular barriers and organelles within microalgal cells in response to Ni excess. Considering that real-world wastewater scenarios often involve the coexistence of both Mn and Ni, we plan to map samples exposed to both elements to investigate if their concurrent presence induces changes in the mode of accumulation. XRF is indispensable for intracellular metal mapping, facilitating the localization of Ni and Mn by identifying cellular compartments based on the known distribution of elements (P, Ca, Fe, Cl, S, Zn). Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation will contribute to the development of microalgae-based biotechnologies for wastewater treatment and metal recovery.","1229":"The vulnerability of stony coral to environmental ocean acidification (OA) is of paramount concern in light of the imminent climate changes. We are studying the spatial distributions and arrangements of the CaCO3 crystalline phases within the early-formed coral polyps, for which sub-micrometer X-ray beams (< 100 nm) are essential. Previous FIB-SEM measurements on lamella containing rapid-accretion and thickening deposits lacked nanoscale tomographic imaging, preventing us from resolving the structures of larva grown under normal (pH 8.2) and acidic (pH 7.6) conditions. ID16B combines the possibility to collect nanoCT of our FIB lamella and perform XRD and XRF mapping, to identify Sr rich domains, and to map calcite within the aragonite-rich crystal domains. Lab-grown samples under normal and simulated OA conditions will reveal at ID16B the nano- and microstructural adaptations of stony corals, possibly revealing paths to sustain calcification in future acid-affected ocean environments.","1230":"Iron delivery to target proteins is not through diffusion (free iron is toxic) but through protein-protein interactions with proteins known as iron-chaperones. While iron-chaperones have been studied in mammals, no orthologue is known in plants. Evidence from our lab has provided the identity of one candidate plant Fe-chaperone: Mt080. This protein has the iron-binding domain of mammalian iron-chaperones, interacts with iron transporter NRAMP1, the main iron importer for Medicago truncatula root nodule cells, and its mutation results in reduced nitrogenase activity (an enzyme with 38 iron atoms). We propose to use ID21  to determine how iron distribution is affected by Mt080 mutation, supporting its role as iron-chaperone. Moreover, we would like to address how the cells accommodate for this altered iron delivery pathway by determining iron speciation changes in the mutant lines, using XANES. All this information will be used to finalize a publication on the biological role of Mt080. ","1231":"Zinc (Zn) is essential for all biota, while cadmium (Cd) is non-essential for most biota and poses a health risk at relatively low concentrations for humans. While reduced sulfur groups (R-SH, thiols) can separate chemically these trace metals in plants, the role of thiols in agricultural soils on the phytoavailability of these metals is largely unexplored. We expect that soil thiols can selectively reduce the transfer of Cd from soils to crops. To this end, we will determine S speciation in a large variety of agricultural soils using XANES. The XANES data will be combined with phytoavailability data of Zn and Cd (i.e. soil extracts) and soil properties that are known to control the phytoavailability of these trace metals (e.g., soil pH). Finally, multivariate statistics will be applied to determine the importance of thiols on the phytoavailability of Zn and Cd. With this unprecedented dataset we seek to provide novel knowledge that will help to improve the quality of staple crops.","1232":"Polymetallic nodules and hardgrounds, spread across vast abyssal plains, rich in Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, and REE and yttrium (REY), result from metal precipitation in the ocean due to erosion or hydrothermal emissions. Clarion-Clipperton Zone's polymetallic nodules boast concentrations of up to 2800 ppm REY, making them promising alternative sources for rare earth supply. However, uncertainties persist regarding REY enrichment mechanisms resulting in strong variations in Ce anomalies. Biogenic fluorapatite and Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxides are acknowledged Ce scavengers, yet their enrichment mechanisms remain under-explained. These experiments will pioneer \u03bcXRF and \u03bcXANES measurements, illuminating the distribution of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in Clarion-Clipperton polymetallic nodules. Furthermore, the acquired data will serve as a proxy to subsequently investigate and comprehend the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of Ce and REY in polymetallic nodules and hardgrounds found in Spanish waters.","1233":"As lithium (Li) plays a critical role in Li-ion batteries powering electric mobility, Europe's dependence on external Li sources prompts initiatives to establish domestic production. Two mines in Portugal and Finland aim to commence exploitation of Li-rich pegmatites by 2025, enhancing Europe's Li supply security. However, environmental risks linked to Li extraction from hard rock resources remain unexplored, despite noted high arsenic (As) concentrations in tailings from pilot studies at these mines. Given the intricate mineralogy of As in these lithologies and its significant impact on mobility, spatially-resolved and bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the As K-edge will be used to quantitatively determine the As speciation in these tailings. Furthermore, we will investigate the mineralogical origin of As mobility by comparing our leaching test results to the solid As speciation in leaching residues at different stages of Li recovery in relation to waste management options.","1234":"We propose to study how emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) from Antarctica1 detoxify methylmercury and the species of Hg transferred to chick embryos.

The project will address this topic through a series of experiments that will provide results on the stability and reaction pathways of supercritical and solid CO2 with pyrite (FeS2). The results will pave the way for future research in multiple, deeply interconnected fields since the project will not only help to further clarify the potential applications of CO2-sulfide systems for the capture of CO2 but will also provide new information to understand the behaviour of the CO2-sulfide systems at high pressures and temperatures.\r\n\r\n","1236":"Cadmium is toxic at low concentrations for most forms of life. Food is the main route of exposure to cadmium for the general population. Chocolate is a Cd contributor in human diet. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms involved in Cd accumulation in this crop, to produce beans with less Cd. Cd speciation in plant organs is challenging because of the low Cd concentrations (0.5 to 5 mg kg-1 FW). HERFD-XAS is a promising technique, and has not been used for Cd so far. We propose a Cd LIII-edge HERFD-XAS study on Cd model compounds to build a database and evaluate the potential of this method to distinguish Cd species, and assign spectral features to structural parameters. This study will be a first step of a proof of concept of the interest of HERFD-XAS to study Cd in diluted environmental samples.","1237":"Soil organic matter (SOM) in organic surface layers of forest soils (forest floors; FF) is susceptible to P losses and conversion of soil carbon into atmospheric CO2 by global warming. Formation of SOM-mineral associations and aggregates stabilizes forest floor SOM against decomposition and reduces undesired ecosystem C and P losses; The mechanisms involved in this process and the microspatial structure of the formed SOM-mineral associations are largely unknown.

While the predicted LaH10 phase with a high superconducting temperature (Tc) was reported to have been observed, both resistivity and powder X-ray diffraction measurements reveal highly inhomogeneous samples with numerous unknown phases. To properly understand the high Tc detected in La-H samples, it is vital to structurally identify all phases present. The here proposed investigation aims at unambiguously solving the crystal structure of all crystalline solids observed in laser-heated La-H mixtures between 135 GPa and 180 GPa by employing the submicronic and high intensity X-ray beam of ID11 to perform single crystal X-ray diffraction on the resulting polycrystalline La-H samples. This crucial investigation will enable the complete understanding of the ultra-high Tc measurements in La-H mixtures.","1265":"Magnetite (Fe3O4) has a complex low-temperature (Verwey) transition, brought upon by charge, orbital and spin degree of freedom ordering of the octahedral irons of the structure. Sequential works at ID11 and ID22 at ESRF not only unveiled the nature of this transition and its dependency with doping, but also established the local persistence of the distortion up to the Curie temperature of the material (TC = 858 K). \r\nSingle crystal diffuse scattering measurements on high-purity Fe3O4 and Fe3-xZnxO4 will allow the three-dimensional nature of this local distortion and its sensitivity to doping to be seen. Moreover, by heating up the samples in air, the effect of local defects due to oxidation on the diffuse scattering will be unveiled.

With recent reviews lamenting a lack of detailed crystal structure data, especially at the local scale, this experiment plans to investigate a recently developed refractory HEA and its precursors. High resolution powder diffraction will help determining the phases across its binary, ternary, quinary compositions and, through microstructure analysis, studying the local strain fields that are key to alloy strengthening mechanisms. Distortion and sublattice ordering will be also characterised at the atomic and nano scale by pair-distribution function analysis (PDF). ","1272":"High-Tc superconductivity (SC) in the cuprates is a thoroughly investigated, yet still unresolved problem. A prominent theoretical model suggests that dynamic charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations are responsible for the pseudogap (PG) and SC, and requires the existence of dynamic CDW correlations in a much larger part of the phase diagram than previously thought . Our resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) work in HgBa2CuO4+d (Hg1201) revealed dynamic CDW correlations above the CDW ordering temperature, and evidence for a connection with the pairing glue. This is consistent with the theoretical proposal, but there remain important questions about the connection between CDW, PG and SC. We therefore wish to extend our work to optimally-doped Hg1201, where Tc is highest and static CDW correlations are weak, and to a wider temperature range to investigate the effect of doping and the relationship between CDW, SC, and the PG phase.","1275":"The role of phonons in the high Tc superconductivity of cuprates is still hotly debated. Recently, new experimental findings and theoretical arguments have pointed out that buckling phonons may play a major role in the physics of these materials due to the large electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Among other, the buckling mode is expected to vary more among cuprates, as an effect of the different static buckling of the CuO2 planes, being the Cu-O-Cu angle almost 180\u00b0 in infinite layer compounds and of several degrees off in LSCO and YBCO. Here, we propose to exploit the \uf07e25 meV Bandwidth, soon available at ID32 thanks to an ongoing upgrade of the optics, to investigate by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering the buckling modes of 3 cuprate families. For the first time the EPC of the buckling mode will be  mapped systematically, in search for a correlation between the EPC, the buckling and the presence of apical oxygen.  ","1276":"In the framework of the investigations of charge order and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, our pioneering x-ray scattering work using uniaxial pressure has shown that 2D charge density waves (CDW) are enhanced in the direction perpendicular to that of applied stress in YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) crystals. Crucially, our results on 2D-CDW can be explained in terms of strong nematic susceptibility which results in a symmetric response to compressive stress applied either to the a- or b-axis and makes alternatively energetically favourable the b- or a-CDW domains, respectively, on top of pre-existing domains pinned by defects. We propose to carry out Cu-L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering on YBCO under uniaxial pressure to investigate this scenario. We will compare the a- and b-CDW peaks upon cooling the crystals with and without applied stress and we will map the 2D Brillouin Zone in search of ring-like dynamic charge density fluctuations condensing to static CDW at low temperature.

These fascinating properties emerge from the nonzero Berry curvature in the inverse triangular antiferromagnetic structure on the Kagome lattice of Mn atoms. The nonzero Berry curvature is attributed to the existence of local cluster multipole moments, a generalization of the uniform magnetization in ferromagnets. This notion has been supported by the disappearance of terahertz anomalous Hall effect upon entering the helical magnetic state.

By combining our transport data with RIXS, representing the most powerful technique for the detection of CDWs, we aim at correlating the characteristics of the charge order to changes in the crystal structure and transport properties at different thicknesses. A successful identification of CDWs in slightly overdoped YBCO would give the first evidence that the critical doping of charge order can be tuned by strain and therefore by geometrical modification of the unit cell. \r\n","1280":"With this experiment, we want to investigate the theoretically predicted lattice instability in AFM FeRh in the B2 structure. In preliminary Fe K-edge EXAFS measurements, we observed the occurrence of a lattice distortion that can be modelled by assuming a B2-lattice with slight lattice distortions predicted by Wolloch et al. With the experiment, we want to investigate the local surrounding of the Fe and Rh atoms by EXAFS. Complementary, we plan to investigate the structural lattice instability by X-ray diffraction to further corroborate our spectroscopy results. As a last step, we aim at performing temperature-dependent measurements focussing on the lattice dynamics to investigate changes on the local surrounding around the Fe and Rh atoms (EXAFS) and the long-range order (XRD). Here, we specially want to investigate the effects and possible different structural response of the dynamically stabilised lattice instability on the short range, as well as on the long-range order.","1281":"In this proposal, we aim to investigate the local structure, phase transitions and melting\/recrystallization dynamics of elemental Selenium using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).

While its origin is still a matter of debate, existing explanations for crystalline materials are built on the fcc lattice. However, this approach cannot be used to describe the Invar effect observed in BMGs, because they lack the crystalline structure. The proposed experiment should shed light on what is the real origin of the effect in the BMGs, by in-situ analysis of the local atomic changes, in particular around the atoms that bear a magnetic moment.

We propose temperature-dependent high-pressure XRD measurements that will explore this dimerization instability in MgIrO3 and ZnIrO3, two novel compounds prepared from the previously known beta-Li2IrO3. This parent compound becomes dimerized under pressure of several GPa, but MgIrO3 shows partial dimerization already at ambient pressure, despite its larger unit cell volume that nominally corresponds to a negative pressure applied to beta-Li2IrO3. Experimental information on the temperature dependence of the dimerization transition, phase coexistence upon the transition, and the structure of the dimerized phase will be used to understand the origin of this transformation that controls magnetism of iridates.","1291":"So-called magnetic Weyl semimetals (in the current study Fe-Sn binary compounds (FeSn, Fe3Sn2, and Fe3Sn) combine topologically non-trivial band structures and flat-band ferromagnetism, both arising from the underlying kagome network of the Fe atoms.

The wetting angle of the droplet determines the crystal structure of the NWs which mainly consists of the zinc blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) crystal phases when grown along the [111] crystallographic direction. Regardless of the achieved high degree of control over the crystal phase of GaAs NWs during latter growth stages, it is challenging to control the polytypism at the beginning of the NW growth due to transients in the droplet contact angle. Here, we aim to correlate the crystal structure of as-grown GaAs NWs with the wetting angle of their catalyst liquid Ga droplets at the nucleation phase, by performing (1) grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering on the Ga droplets, and (2) asymmetric X-ray diffraction of polytype sensitive reflections on the NWs underneath.\r\n","1303":"Some incommensurate charge density waves (CDW) materials display a peculiar non-linear current above a certain threshold, which is believe to be due to a charge transport by a travelling soliton lattice.

Domain walls were originally believed to have zero polarisation at their centre, but theoretical predictions have shown that they exhibit complex polarisation patterns with unique phase transitions that are distinct from the bulk material. We are studying a phase in tensile-strained ferroelectric thin films in which domain walls are aligned along one crystallographic direction when deposited on an orthorhombic substrate.

Many different aspects concerning this experiment, like the sample and marker preparation, the remote organization and local nanoXRD measurements worked. Unfortunately, due to a leak in the oven and therefore severe unwanted oxidation, a vital part of the experiment could not be performed: we have no information about any structural surface changes after an anneal in pure nitrogen.

We refer to experimental report HC-4065 for details concerning the previous beamtime.","1309":"The giant magnetocaloric effect that couples a change in magnetic field to a change in temperature has been observed in several materials showing either a magnetoelastic or a magnetostructural transition. In the magnetoelastic transition the symmetry of the lattice is conserved, while it changes in the magnetostructural transition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the underlying mechanisms of the magnetoelastic and magnetostructural transitions both rely on an electronic redistribution. We have successfully confirmed this prediction for the magnetoelastic transition by powder X-ray diffraction. To test the generality of the predicted mechanism, we propose to perform high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction on MnCoGe-based alloys that show a magnetostructural transition.

The aim of this project is to measure XMCD spectra at the K-edges of Mn and Co to determine the values and orientation of the magnetic moments and to establish if the ordering is ferromagnetic (FM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) in nature. We will also perform XMCD at the K-edges of Ge and As to elucidate the role of these elements in the magnetic exchange interactions.","1324":"The saga of HTS has been recently enriched by the detection of the pair density wave (PDW) order. Such emerging order characterized by Coopers pairs with finite momentum has been directly observed for the first time by STM in 2016. In agreement with theory, STM experiments determined the PDW wavelength to be twice that of CDW. However a modulation with a wavevector Q=Q_CDW\/2  has not been observed by X-ray scattering experiments so far.\r\nA recent RIXS measurement on underdoped YBCO seems to solve this contradiction: by isolating the quasi-elastic contribution of the RIXS spectra along the (H,0) direction from the background, we revealed both a CDW peak at  Q_CDW\u22480.32 rlu and a second peak at Q\u2248Q_CDW\/2.\r\nHere we propose to study with RIXS the latter peak, as function of temperature T and doping p, in YBCO thin films. The T and p evolution of the peak will tell us if this peak is the long-searched PDW peak, possibly giving hints on its connection with the CDW and the SC states.","1325":"Previous studies have suggested that a large difference in electron affinity can cause interfacial charge transfer from Ti to Ni in LaTiO3\/LaNiO3 heterostructures, leading to large orbital polarization, crossover of charge-transfer (CT) energy regimes, and possible magnetic orders not found in bare LaNiO3. Particularly, a preliminary RIXS measurement (resolution: 100 meV) has revealed a possible existence of low-energy magnon excitations at the Ni L2 edge. Here, we propose a systematic study of nLaTiO3\/mLaNiO3 superlattices with varying n\/m ratios using high-resolution RIXS (resolution: 35 meV) at Ni L2 edge, to resolve these low-energy features and observe their evolution as a function of confinement and CT energy regimes. The results will identify the nature of the possible magnetic order, and its existence would indicate an emergent transformation of LaNiO3 from a paramagnetic metal into a magnetic insulator.","1327":"The angular momentum compensation temperature TA is of great importance in spintronics, since fast domain wall motion and fast switching of the magnetization in metallic ferrimagnets can be achieved near TA. Furthermore, spin torque effects are greatly enhanced around TA, which opens new routes for spin-orbit torque applications in low-current-dissipation, spin-current-based heavy metal\/ferrimagnetic insulator heterostructures. To exploit the rich physics near TA, an unambiguous determination of TA is essential. We propose to investigate the spin and angular momentum in RE3Fe5O12 (RE=Dy, Tb) single crystal and thin film samples by the element-specific XMCD technique as a function of temperature. By using magneto-optical sum rules we will determine the spin and orbital moment as a function of temperature to determine TM and TA. This will allow us to further investigate the spin transport as well as spin caloric effects in compensated ferromagnetic insulators around TA.       ","1329":"Despite more than 30 years of intense research on high-Tc superconducting cuprates, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that lead to their exceptionally strong superconductivity has remained elusive. Using Cu L3-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), three-dimensional collective charge excitations were revealed in electron-doped cuprates, which subsequently were also observed in hole-doped cuprates by O K-edge RIXS. Interestingly, these collective excitations correspond to the long-anticipated acoustic plasmon modes of cuprates, which were suggested to contribute to the mediation of superconducting pairing, and their evolution across Tc could reflect a possible saving of kinetic energy correlated with the superconducting transition. Here we propose an O K-edge RIXS study on the hole-doped cuprate YBa2Cu3O7 to investigate the behavior of acoustic plasmons above and below the superconducting transition and a possible relation to the elevated Tc of cuprates.","1330":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate the dynamics of spin waves propagating in domain walls of thick permalloy elements. In particular, we will image their propagation and explore the intrinsic characteristics, such as eigen modes and damping parameter, as functions of the external stimuli. The investigation will be carried out using the high coherence of the EBS by time-resolved x-ray imaging, using Fourier transform holography with extended references.\r\n","1333":"The superconductivity in tri-layer cuprate Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x (Bi2223) is intriguing, not only because it has the highest Tc,max (~110K) among Bi-family, but also the Tc shows a negligible reduction with overdoping. This is very surprising since this obviously violates the Tc dome that is deemed a universal trend for cuprates. However, there is still no consensus on why the Tc is so robust in the overdoped Bi2223. Here we propose to use the high resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to examine the T-dependence of charge excitations and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in optimally and overdoped Bi2223, which are reported to entangle with the superconducting phase of cuprates. The aim is to determine their correlations with the robust high Tc and find out the essential factor for the high Tc superconductivity in Bi2223. The answer can reveal the nature of the highest Tc in tri-layer cuprates and provide insights on how to raise Tc.","1335":"The aim of this proposal is to measure the pressure, doping and temperature dependence of the Nd1-xSrxNiO2, (x<0.2) bidimensionnal network. This work compared to the experimental results obtained on superconducting thin films of Nd1-xSrxNiO2, will help to elucidate the key role played by the substrate. Associated to ongoing resistivity and raman spectroscopy measurements, we will establish a phase diagram of bulk Nd1-xSrxNiO2 ","1336":"The aim of the proposed experiment is to elucidate the nature of the structural transition into the collapsed tetragonal phase of EuT2P2 (T = Fe, Ru, Co) under pressure at 10, 50 and 300 K. This proposal is motivated by the possibility of a strong coupling of electronic and structural degrees of freedom around the valence transition of Eu-based pnictides. If the valence transition of europium is intertwined with the structural transition into the collapsed tetragonal phase, this would open the way to a new materials class with intriguing coupled electronic and elastic phenomena. To this end, we will study high-quality crystals and follow the large change (~20%) of the c\/a ratio of the lattice parameters as function of pressure up to 10 GPa.","1337":"Carbonyl\u2013carbonyl (CC) interactions are emerging noncovalent interactions found in many small and macro molecules. They are of quantum-mechanical nature, where overlap of n  and \u03c0*  wavefunctions occurs along the trajectory which ensures the maximum orbital overlay. In some of the organic anhydride (OA) crystals, the intermolecular CC contacts along this trajectory are exceptionally short and direct the molecules for the nucleophilic addition reaction . We recently discovered a crystal structure distortion and dramatic change in C=O vibrational modes in pyromellitic dianhydride  at high pressure. We associate it with intra-crystal polymerization, as a result of an effective overlap of C=O groups. In this proposal, we aim to systematically study a series of  simple maleic anhydride derivatives, using high-pressure X-ray diffraction technique, in order to derive general rules for pressure-driven condensation in OA crystals, depending on their electronic and supramolecular structure.  ","1338":"The main goal of this proposal is to obtain reliable experimental data on the crystal structure, isotropic ADP for Co and O, as well as lattice parameters of La0.5Ba0.5CoO2.75 under applied pressure. The combination of X-ray with neutron (D20, ILL) diffraction and XMCD data (ID-12, ESRF, accepted proposal HC-4142) taken at high pressure will give us the opportunity to analyze the crystal with magnetic and electronic structure distortions in order to establish the correlations between crystal and magnetic structure changes and clarify the origin of magneto-structural phase transition in La0.5Ba0.5CoO2.75 at ambient pressure near the AFM-FM, PM-FM, the ST as well as to provide an input for detailed state-of-the-art DFT calculations to verify the mechanism of selective pressure effect on the magnetic ground state and small structural distortions, including the analysis of isotropic ADP for Co and O","1339":"Recently there has been an increased interest in the high pressure community in the synthesis and study of High Energy Density Materials (HEDM) since the synthesis of singly-bonded cubic-gauge Nitrogen. Barium dinitride (BaN2) has been shown to be synthesized [Vajenine et al., 2001, Inorg. Chem.]  at moderate pressures (0.3GPa) and high temperatures (920K) with a predicted double bonded nitrogen network [Wessel et al., 2010, J. Am. Chem. Soc] and has further been predicted to have several stable stoichiometric compounds with a significantly higher nitrogen content [Huang et al., 2018, Am. Chem. Soc], up to BaN10. Several of these computed compounds contain singly bonded or exotic nitrogen networks which are recoverable to atmospheric pressures. The Barium-Nitrogen system will be explored via high pressure up to >100GPa along with laser heating through a series of diamond anvil cell experiments to realize and characterize these exotic polyntiride compounds. ","1340":"This proposal aims at measuring the structural changes and the EoS of hydrogen up to above 400 GPa. \r\n Various advances can now provide a game-changer in the structural study of hydrogen: the reopening of the beamline ID27 on the new EBS (Extremely Brilliant Source) with  a submicrom beamsize; the availability of a state of the art detector (Eiger2 CdTe 9M from Dectris); the possibility to generate pressure above 400 GPa on a 6 \u00b5m diameter sample using toroidal diamond anvil. We plan to investigate the structural properties of phase IV above 220 GPa  up to 400 GPa and  of phase III above 180 GPa at 80 K. \r\n","1341":"Even at a modest pressure of 100 GPa we have seen 6-fold compression in potassium (K) and rubidium (Rb), and above 300 GPa we expect 10-fold compression to be achieved. Such extreme compression ratios result in significant atomic core-valence overlap causing fundamental distortions in the electron band structure and exotic phases. We propose to investigate these structures in K to 500 GPa using both conventional and toroidal diamond anvil cells. The unprecedented brightness of the new ID27 beamline makes this experiment possible for the first time.","1342":"The aim of this proposal is to explore the structural properties and P-T boundaries of the superionic phases of water, as a continuation of our previous runs HC-2185 and HC-3952. In run HC-2185, using CO2 laser heating, we were able to determine the melting curve of water up to 45 GPa and evidence the transition to the superionic bcc ice [1]. In run HC-3952 we extended the investigated pressure range to 166 GPa using YAG laser heating and observed the bcc-fcc transition at two pressures, 100 and 166 GPa. The aim of the present proposal is to map in more details the bcc-fcc transition line from 50 to 200 GPa and extend the melting line measurement of superionic ice up to 200 GPa. This will allow us to extract the thermodynamics of each phase transition from which it can be determined the molecular or superionic nature.","1344":"When heated above 159\u00b0C, the molecular liquid sulfur suddenly undergoes a partial and reversible polymerization transition, a phenomenon known as the \u201clambda transition\u201d (\u03bb-T). Despite the large number of experimental and theoretical studies devoted to this long-standing topic, the nature and origin of the lambda transition in sulfur are still elusive.  The aim of this proposal is to accurately measure the temperature dependence of the isothermal compressibility KT and coherence length \u03be in the vicinity of the lambda transition using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). This will be the first direct determination of the T dependence of KT and \u03be that will, in turn, provide invaluable information on the underlying microscopic mechanism of the puzzling lambda transition. In particular, is there a diverging correlation length near the lambda transition? ","1345":"This proposal is part of the study on the series of phase transitions of lead hafnate PbHfO3 ALD-deposited thin films. The main objective is to determine the structure of the polar phase induced by an electric field. A secondary objective will be to infirm or confirm the presence of a potentially antiferroelectric intermediate phase in between the room temperature antiferroelectric and the high temperature phase seen in bulk single crystal PbHfO3.","1347":"Our most recent experiments on ID09 support a scheme whereby the macroscopic volume expansion and spin state switching are separated in time. Such behaviour is different from the expectation that phase transformation only requires atomic displacements in the unit cell, that can occur simultaneously with propagation of a volumic strain.  SCO molecules instead remain trapped by local energy barriers separating low spin and high spin states. The observed delay between the volume increase (caused predominantly by lattice heating) and the macroscopic switching may be an indication of a cooperative process during phase separation that takes longer than the switching of independent molecules. This finding motivates an optimised material design, scalable with size dependent dynamics and intrinsic energetics. Here, we propose to study nanocrystals undergoing molecular spin transition in a form of oriented thin films, and exhibiting negligibly small thermal expansion.","1348":"The speed of the polarization reversal of ferroelectric (FE) nanolayers is of great interest for fundamental research and applications like sensing or data storage. However, the dynamics strongly depends on the domain structure of the thin films. We have shown how the structural and electrical response affect the switching dynamics. In this step we want to investigate how one can increase the speed of the polarization reversal: Therefore, we want to use small electrodes, which reduce the RC time constant of the FE device given by the active area and study how additional laser illumination affects the structural dynamics by strain and\/or heat waves using time-resolved X-ray diffraction.","1349":"We propose to probe the beam induced dynamics in a \u03b1-quartz single crystal by means of X-ray photo correlation spectroscopy (XPCS). We expect an amorphization process analogue to that measured in the neutron irradiated crystalline samples. Furthermore, we will monitor the structure of the irradiated sample using an additional detector mounted near the sample stage. The experiment would provide a complete structural and dynamical analysis of the solid-solid transition pumped by the ionizing beam.","1350":"One of the long-standing challenges in the Cu-based superconductors is understanding the nontrivial interplay between the high-temperature superconductivity, density waves and pseudogap. While all these states are of electronic nature, our preliminary x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements on La2-xSrxCuO4 (x = 0.125) indicate the key role of local strain fluctuations. The proposed XPCS experiment aims to test and establish this scenario by systematically investigating these fluctuations as a function of hole concentrations (x) and temperature.","1351":"Siderite (FeCO3) is a common carbonate mineral in iron-bearing sedimentary settings and soils. It is present on Earth in a large variety of environments, which can be targets of impacts, and it has also been identified in meteorites. Two previous studies on natural siderite have demonstrated the shock-induced decomposition of siderite into iron oxides and carbon-bearing species that could explain the origin of magnetite in the Martian meteorite ALH84001 as due to a shock event. Both studies have been performed on recovered samples and give no clues on the timing and mechanisms of this transformation (e.g. peak shock or adiabatic release). In this proposal, we aim at in-situ observation of such transformation by time-resolved X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy during laser shock compression by exploiting the capability of the new High-Power Laser Facility (HPLF) at the ESRF.","1352":"The phase diagram and melting curve of Ni under dynamic loading conditions are still poorly known, and the scarce available data show large disagreement with the existing static high pressure data and microscopic theoretical calculations. In this proposal, we will therefore investigate the solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions in shock compressed Ni, by coupling time resolved XAS measurements with laser shock compression performed using the ID24\u2019s High Power Laser Facility (HPLF). These EXAFS\/XANES measurements will provide information on the local-structure that cannot be determined through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, and they will be directly compared to static XAS data previously measured on ID24 and to extensive ab initio MD simulations.","1353":"The aim of the present proposal is to probe Sm Valence and magnetic state across the magnetic field induced closure of the correlation gap. In resistivity measurements, the closure has been observed at 89 T. It has also been shown, that the correlation gap inferred from resistivity measurements can be reduced through through the application of pressure at a rate of -0.7meV\/GPa. We therefore use pressure to reduce and tune the gap, and pulsed high magnetic fields up to 30T in order to reach the expected closure. Previous measurements at ambient pressure and pressures up to 1.9 GPa did not show a significant evolution of the Sm valence contrary to expectations. In this continuation we therefore aim to corroborate this observation and to extend our measurements to higher pressures.","1354":"Magnetite (Fe3O4) is one of the most fascinating quantum materials exhibiting the enigmatic first-order Verwey transition. This transition manifests itself in an abrupt change in electrical conductivity and in the nature of the trimeron correlations (linear three-Fe-site units) from long- to short-range. We recently discovered that heating Fe3O4 above ~400 K results in a cation reordering and consequently a hole self-doping effect which alters short-range correlations at the octahedral sublattice. Strikingly, four regimes of self-doping can be identified that map the temperature depenendence electrical conductivity and magnetism up to the Curie temperature providing an elegant descriptor of correlations. Here we propose to investigate the effect of pressure on cation ordering and short-range correlations in Fe3O4 using Fe Kedge HERFD-XAS in search of a pressure-driven self-doping effect.","1355":"The CDW state appears in the diffraction pattern as an incommensurate modulation of the lattice, the wavevector of the modulation is related to the Fermi wavevector of the condensed electrons, QIC~2kF. One of the goals of these proposals is to solve a long-standing fundamental controversy, that goes back to the early days, on the means by which the CDW state is created: either weak or strong electron-phonon coupling. A key point in this controversy is how the CDW is pinned to the lattice, and therefore experiments under an applied electric field are mandatory. IXS experiments are in principle feasible but are time consuming and, in view of our past experience, it is very unlikely that they can be of much help in this task [HC-4045]. An alternative approach that we would like to explore in this proposal is the study of the intensity of the diffuse scattering under an applied electric field through the threshold value and at different temperatures.","1356":"GaAs nanowires (NWs) are often fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy using the self-catalyzed vapour-liquid-solid mode, where a liquid Ga catalyst droplet at the apex of the NW drives the axial crystal growth. The wetting angle of the droplet determines the crystal structure of the NWs which mainly consists of the zinc blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) crystal phases when grown along the [111] crystallographic direction. Regardless of the achieved high degree of control over the crystal phase of GaAs NWs during latter growth stages, it is challenging to control the polytypism at the beginning of the NW growth due to transients in the droplet contact angle. Here, we aim to correlate the crystal structure of as-grown GaAs NWs with the wetting angle of their catalyst liquid Ga droplets at the nucleation phase, by performing (1) grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering on the Ga droplets, and (2) asymmetric X-ray diffraction of polytype sensitive reflections on the NWs underneath.","1357":"In this proposal, we intend to follow and study the structural changes in three dimensions (3D) of multiple Pt nanoparticles (NPs) under realistic electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More precisely, we aim to map the strain response of multiple single NPs as a function of the electrode potential by probing the particles at different Bragg peaks to get the full 3D strain tensor. The Pt NPs will be immersed in H2SO4 and the electrode potential will be applied to trigger different reactions (e.g ORR, HER). This experiment will complement previous studies carried out at ID01 beamline.","1358":"The metal-insulator transition (MIT) of Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has attracted great attention due to its wide potential applications, e.g., smart windows, memory devices, and optical switching devices, based on a relatively low critical temperature and large changes in resistivity. One key parameter for the device performance is the strain-involved structural evolution during phase transition, which is still lacking. In our previous microbeam X-ray diffraction study, we confirmed the coexistence of the M1 and M2 phases caused by tensile strain. Here, we propose an in-situ temperature-dependent diffraction imaging of VO2 microcrystals to investigate the MIT and its intermediate phases to improve our knowledge of the MIT for development of high performance nano-devices with specific functionalities by controlling the morphology of twin VO2 nanocrystals.","1359":"In this proposal, we intend to address by in situ Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) a striking phenomenon that has been recently observed by our collaborators in Technion (group of E. Rabkin, Technion\/Israel), which are the ordering and reorientation of disordered PtNi alloy (50:50 composition) nanoparticles after annealing at 550\u00b0C. The new EBS beam and BCDI make it possible to probe in situ crystallographic reorientation of single particles (from [111]- to [001]-oriented particles) and ordering through superstructure reflections.","1361":"Platinum group metal (PGM) nanocrystals (NCs) and their alloys are frequently used as catalysts in many relevant (electro)-chemical processes. In this proposal, we intend to follow the formation and propagation of structural defects as well as strain changes of multiple single Pt NCs under realistic electrochemical reactions (e.g. oxygen reduction reaction \u2013 ORR), these two parameters being descriptors of the ORR kinetics. This approach will complement the study of single-crystal samples performed by coherent Bragg diffraction by providing a more statistical approach.","1362":"The aim of this experiment is to measure the interfacial stress fields that lead to functional fatigue in materials that undergo martensitic phase transformations (MPTs) such as shape memory alloys (SMAs). MPT is a diffusionless, often reversible phase transformation between a high-symmetry and a low-symmetry phase. It is the enabling mechanism behind the novel properties of SMAs, switchable multiferroics, and TRIP steels, but functional fatigue continues to be a major barrier. Functional fatigue is caused by stress fields that form at the phase interface and lead to dislocation generation. We plan to use dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) to measure these interfacial stress fields during stress-induced MPT for the first time, using a mechanical load frame. CuAlNi SMAs will be mechanically cycled to observe how dislocations develop in connection with these interfacial stress fields and influence the functional fatigue behavior.","1363":"This proposal will measure how crystal symmetry dictates the exotic non-classical dynamics of dislocations as crystals approach and reach Tm to build a data-inspired multiscale model for melting physics. Thus far, the details of bulk dislocation pathways to melting are based on advanced multiscale models, yet untested. Experiments have been unable to resolve the in-situ dynamics of how subsurface dislocations contribute to melting, limiting melt theory to model systems that over-simplify the physics. A new computational method predicted that just as the symmetry of the lattice destabilizes towards a disordered liquid, a plethora of defect interactions should create numerous degenerate pathways to melt. Our work on Al confirmed exotic multiscale dynamics for a single material. For robust comparison, we must generalize these trends. Our findings will reveal the key dislocation physics required to describe how defects at the mesoscale contribute to melting. ","1364":"This proposal aims to synthesize, study crystal structures and high-pressure behavior of calcium carbides employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) in laser-heated diamond anvil cells (LHDACs). At first, we would like to establish the behavior field of known Ca-C phases. Second, we are going to perform a step-wise map of achievable PT conditions in order to explore the pressure and temperature effect on the formation of polyanionic carbon species in alkali metal-carbon systems. The bold goal of this proposal is to synthesize and quench novel polycarbides at ambient conditions.","1365":"Hybrid improper ferroelectrics (HIF) are a class of materials where polarisation itself is not the primary order parameter but arises instead from coupling to non-polar distortions (e.g. octahedral rotations). Despite substantial progress over the last years, the nature of polarisation switching mechanisms and domain structure remain elusive. Recently we demonstrated through in situ diffraction that the structural response of a polycrystalline HIF to electric field points to one of the allowed symmetry-lowering switching pathways (X2+) being much softer than the others. The next step in understanding the field-induced switching mechanism is to probe the grain-resolved response by in situ 3DXRD. By highlighting the spatial correlation of switching grains through their characteristic superstructure reflections we will better understand both the relation between crystallographic orientation and field direction and the microstructural origin of the observed structural response.","1366":"  The wide range of color observed in skeletal elements of marine calcifying invertebrates, in particular, in sea urchin biominerals, is due to the presence of\r\na family of organic pigment molecules: the polyhydroxylated naphthoquinones (PHNQ), which are incorporated within the biominerals. It is well known that intra-crystalline organic molecules induce lattice distortions within the biogenic crystals as compared to geological ones and participate in shaping the complex morphologies of biominerals. However, the specific role of the organic pigments on the resulting biomineral lattice distortions has never been investigated to our knowledge. Here, we aim to do so by performing high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction (HR-XRPD) measurements at ID22 of sea urchin spines of different colors and of synthetic CaCO3 samples colored by PHNQ molecules.","1368":"The frustrated spinel ZnV2O4 is a material where chemical and magnetic (dis)orders are deeply intertwined. We have prepared two powder samples, one via a sintering method and the other via a microwave-assisted route (MW). Previously, we performed a high-resolution diffraction measurement on ID22 which revealed that the MW sample remained cubic down to 4 K whereas the sintered sample underwent a phase transition below 35 K. We also observed significant diffuse scattering below the Bragg peaks of both samples, and that the peaks of our sintered sample are inherently broad (at least 2x broader than the MW sample), both of which indicate local structural disorder. Following on from these results, we now wish to perform a full total scattering experiment on ID22. Together with our high-resolution data, this will allow us to explore the average and local structures of our two samples, and understand why only one has a phase transition, and the impact this has on the magnetic ground state.","1370":"We propose high-resolution x-ray diffraction on the topological kagome metal Fe3Sn2. This trigonal compound exhibits ferromagnetic order below 650 K and undergoes a spin reorientation toward the ab-plane below 200 K. At low temperatures, magnetic order and orbital nematicity violate three-fold symmetry and creates preconditions for the symmetry lowering of the crystal structure that we seek to probe in the high-resolution experiment. By temperature-dependent diffraction studies, we will address the origin of the spin reorientation in Fe3Sn2 and gauge changes in the crystal structure that affect its topological energy bands. This will be an essential step to quantify magnetoelastic coupling in the family of Fe-Sn kagome metals.","1371":"We propose an x-ray diffraction experiment to investigate the structural evolution of v-SiO2 under x-ray irradiation. Recent x-ray photon correlation experiments have revealed that the x-ray beam simultaneously pumps and probes the dynamics of oxide glasses at temperatures where the spontaneous structural relaxation is frozen. The observed dynamics is accompanied by a progressive rearrangement of the glass structure, which evolves towards a different amorphous configuration. This behaviour suggests the existence of a x-ray induced amorphous-amorphous transition. A detailed structural investigation is thus pivotal to elucidate the microscopic nature of the x-ray induced dynamics in glasses.","1372":"In order to mitigate climate change and suppress ever-increasing atmospheric CO2 emission, capture and storage technologies have been proposed. The development of efficient and stable CO2 sorbents is a crucial step towards carbon dioxide neutrality. Solid CaO- and MgO-based sorbents are highly promising materials for CO2 capture, owning to their high theoretical CO2 uptake and intermediate operational temperatures and natural abundance. However, bare MgO has a very low CO2 uptake that can be accelerated appreciably through the addition of alkali metal salts (e.g., NaNO3, KNO3, LiNO3, and their eutectic mixtures).\r\nOur research is focused on resolving the structural mechanism of CO2 uptake by a combination of complementary in situ methods including in situ environmental SEM, in situ TEM and in situ XRD techniques.","1374":"The aim of the proposal is (i) to quantitatively follow with high accuracy the evolution of the number of uranium 5f electrons in the recently discovered triplet superconductor UTe2 under high pressure using XANES and (ii) to probe the magnetic phase that occurs under pressure using high pressure XMCD at the U M4,5-edges.","1375":"This proposal is aiming to measure the XMCD at the L3,2-edges and at the M3,2-edges of uranium in well-defined defined uranium ferromagnetic based system UGe2 and  US as well as in UFe2. A first objective is to understand how the XMCD at the L3,2-edges evolves for those systems and a second objective is to determine quantitatively the spin and orbital magnetic moment of the uranium 6d states using the magneto-optical sum-rules at the M3,2-edges of uranium.  ","1376":"Our pioneering x-ray scattering work using uniaxial pressure has shown that 2D charge density waves (CDW) are enhanced in the direction perpendicular to that of applied compressive strain in YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) crystals. Our results can be explained in terms of strong nematic response on top of pre-existing domains pinned by defects. During our previous beamtime, we carried out Cu-L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering on YBCO under uniaxial pressure and investigated the defect-pinned 2D-CDW scenario. We cooled the crystals after having applied uniaxial strain at high temperature and we compared intensities and correlation of the a- and b-CDW peaks at Tc: the CDW perpendicular to strain was enhanced whereas the parallel CDW is reduced, differently from previous experiments without strain cooling. We propose to continue this investigation in order to draw a clear picture of the effect of uniaxial strain on YBCO and the pinned nature of the 2D CDW state.","1377":"Epitaxial strain provides an important method to control the magnetic and electronic states. Recent transport and XMCD experiments on SrCoO3 films (thickness ~30 nm) show that there exists a metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) with the tensile strain up to 3%, while the ferromagnetic (FM) state is robust and Curie temperature is almost unchanged. The persistent FM state conflicts with the first-principles calculations that predict the transition between FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is induced by the tensile strain, which calls for further investigation of the intrinsic mechanism of this magnetic compound. Here we proposed to use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at Co L3-edge (~ 780 eV) to study the three-dimensional spin excitations in strain-engineering SrCoO3 thin films on various substrates. The results will help to uncover the underlying spin mechanisms of SrCoO3, and provide valuable information on how to realize novel functionalities via stain engineering.","1378":"Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles and are the quanta of magnetic oscillations of systems with periodically ordered magnetic moments. It has been assumed so far that the magnetic moment carried by magnons is composed of only a spin magnetic moment as the spin texture defines the directions relative to which a deviation can occur. Recent work proposed that magnons can carry a complementing non-collinear orbital magnetic moment brought about by spin-orbit coupling or dipolar interactions in addition to its spin magnetic moment. The magnitude of the orbital magnetic moment depends on the details of the system, but first estimations predict that it could be as large as 0.2\u03bcB in Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG). The aim of this proposal is to confirm the presence of an orbital magnetic moment component associated with magnons in YIG by measuring magnetic linear dichroism at magnon excitations using the ultra-high-precision Fe 2p3d resonant inelastic X-ray scattering available at ID32 beamline.","1381":"A promising route to realizing such unconventional electronic states is to combine mutually distinct order parameters in heterostructures. Sr2VO3FeAs is a superlattice of superconducting [SrFeAs]+1 and Mott-insulating [SrVO3]-1 layers, which favors a Q = (pi,0) stripe order and Q = (pi,pi) N\u00e9el order, respectively. A nuclear magnetic resonance study discovered a hidden order below TO ~ 155K without any evidence of apparent symmetry breaking. Furthermore, our preliminary resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) results revealed an incommensurate magnetic instability well correlated with the ordering temperature from magneto-transport, TN ~ 55K and coexisting with the superconductivity. We conjecture the stripe order gives a way to the formation of incommensurate order and ultimately the hidden order by frustration between V and Fe. We propose to use ultra-high-resolution RIXS at the Fe L3 edge to measure the magnetic excitation spectra that encode dynamic spin-spin correlations.","1382":"A single atom with long spin lifetime represents the prototype of the smallest bit for data storage. So far, single atom magnets have been obtained by adsorbing a 4f rare earth atom onto a well-defined site at surfaces, or by inserting it into custom-designed molecular frames. Here we propose a different approach. By combining atom adsorption at surfaces and 2D coordination with organic ligands, we aim at realizing a lattice of rare-earth single atom magnets with tunable magnetic properties. Coordination with tetraphenyl-dicarbonitrile molecules provides high-symmetry C5v crystal field, while the use of graphene as substrate minimizes spin-electron and spin-phonon scattering. The choice of the rare earth species, with oblate or prolate 4f charge distribution and different total angular moment J, determines the orientation of the magnetization easy axis and the spin lifetime.","1383":"The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has sparkled a flurry of theoretical and experimental studies mainly focusing on the properties that mirror that one\u2019s of cuprates. Indeed, the electronic properties of the NiO2 plane are believed to be equivalent to the CuO2 planes. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements evidenced the presence of magnetic excitations with a bandwidth of circa 200 meV in SrTiO3-capped films. We could reproduce such a result on our capped samples but, on the other side, we did not find a clear evidence of such spin excitations for our un-capped ones. Here, we would like to needle down this dichotomy by performing RIXS measurements at the Ni L3-edge by using the polarimeter of the ERIXS spectrometer, to get useful insights on the possible magnetic properties of the low energy feature. Definitely, our results will shed light on the role played by the SrTiO3 capping layer on the appearing of the spin excitations.\r\n","1384":"In 2D antiferromagnetic MPS3 compounds \u2013 M is a 3d transition metal \u2013 the correlation between spin and orbital excitations often leads to strong coupling between the electronic transitions and magnetic order. This quantum behaviour looks particularly appealing in view of the development of opto-spintronic devices. Our preliminary Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) measurements on FePS3 performed at the ID32 beamline at the ESRF show indications of a possible coupling between low energy magnons and electronic excitations in relation to the octahedral and trigonal crystal field components within the FeS6 units in FePS3. In this RIXS experiment we propose to investigate the exact nature of the observed intra-band (dd) transitions and confirm their coupling to the magnetic excitations.","1385":"We propose a systematic investigation of the magnetic properties of Co3Sn2S2 \u2013 one of the first experimentally confirmed ferromagnetic topological Weyl semimetals. By doping Ni or Fe to substitutionally replace Co, and by carrying out an element-specific dichroism study, we intend to track the interplay between the dopant and the host material, in order to understand the origin of the giant intrinsic anomalous Hall angle and anomalous Hall conductivity at certain doping levels. This study will promote the development of high-efficiency spintronic applications in topological materials.","1387":"The aim of the proposed experiment is to utilize the large-volume press at ESRF to elucidate the pressure-induced structural phase transitions we recently observed in NaCrF3 by x-ray diffraction, and further expand this research to the KCrF3 and NH4CrF3 fluoroperovskites. Through the experiments, we foresee that new insight into Cr(II) fluoroperovskites and the rich structural chemistry of fluorides and fluoroperovskites will be gained, including the discovery of new polymorphs. We hope to encounter interesting magnetic and\/or electronic properties in the high-pressure polymorphs. The experiment is a part of an initiative to investigate Cr(II) fluoroperovskites. Neither KCrF3 nor NH4CrF3 are investigated under high-pressure before.","1389":"Chromium arsenide (CrAs) exhibits a first-order magnetic phase transition and pressure-induced superconductivity. The magnetic properties are strongly coupled to the crystal structure, which is expected to play a major role in the understanding of the superconductivity. Recent structural measurements - separately at low temperatures and at high pressures - show that a significantly distinguished behaviour is observed for one particular Cr-Cr distance, which has been linked to magnetic fluctuations essential for the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity. With the proposed single-crystal measurements, we aim to study to crystal structure behaviour of CrAs at high pressure\/low temperature conditions close to the superconducting phase region to further elucidate the nature of the superconductivity.","1390":"Carbonyl\u2013carbonyl (CC) interactions are emerging noncovalent interactions found in many small and macro molecules. They are of quantum-mechanicalnature, where overlap of n and pi* wavefunctions occurs along the trajectory which ensures the maximum orbital overlay. In some of the organic anhydride (OA)crystals, the intermolecular CC contacts along this trajectory are exceptionally short and direct the molecules for the nucleophilic addition reaction . We recently discovered a crystal structure distortion and dramatic change in C=O vibrational modes in pyromellitic dianhydride at high pressure. We associate it with intracrystal polymerization, as a result of an effective overlap of C=O groups. In this proposal, we aim to systematically study a series of simple maleic anhydride derivatives, using high-pressure X-ray diffraction technique, in order to derive general rules for pressure-driven condensation in OA crystals, depending on their electronic and supramolecular structure.","1392":"At 300K, CH4 was shown to be stable up to 200 GPa and structural changes have been reported from Raman and XRD. On the other hand, calculations predict that CH4 should become unstable under pressure and a transformation into C2H6 above 60 GPa and then diamond above 300 GPa should be observed. Is CH4 reluctant to dissociation because of kinetic hindrance or because calculations were not considering the stable structure? A single crystal diffraction reported that the structure of phase B of CH4 at about 8 GPa is indeed more complex than expected. In our previous proposal HC-4449, we were able to confirm this structure and showed that it remained stable up to 120 GPa at least. The aim of the present study is to extend the XRD structural measurements of CH4 up to above 300 GPa. There are two possible important outcomes: 1) CH4 remains stable up to extreme pressures and its metallization could be observed with possible superconductivity; 2) CH4 transforms into diamond and hydrogen.","1393":"The material realization of kagome metals attracted a lot of attention in recent years. The peculiar kagome geometry along with the itinerant carriers cause linearly dispersing bands of Dirac fermions and flat bands. Contrary to the magnetic counterparts dominated by flat-band ferromagnetsm, the AV3Sb5 compounds (A=K, Rb, Cs) were shown to display a charge-density-wave instability as well as superconductivity at ambient pressure. These simple ternary compounds are the first practical candidates for correlated kagome metals where unconventional superconductivity has been predicted theoretically nearly a decade ago. Here, we propose a systematic high-pressure XRD study of AV3Sb5 in order to trace the structural changes and establish their links to the observed properties. We aim to reveal the important structural parameters that stabilize the different CDW and SC states in a non-magnetic kagome metal. ","1395":"Occurrence of solid\/solid phase transitions often affects the melting line and the properties of the corresponding liquid. In the case of Fe, the fcc-hcp-liquid triple point, around 100 GPa and 3500 K, is related to a change in the slope of the melting curve. This argues for possible changes in the physical properties of liquid Fe. Data collected in a previous XRD experiment intriguingly suggest a change in the compressibility of liquid Fe around the triple point. In order to confirm these preliminary observations, and relate this macroscopic behaviour to possible changes in the local atomic arrangement from a fcc-like to an hcp-like structure, we would need further data, in particular at P-T conditions above 100 GPa. We propose to probe the X-ray diffuse scattering signal of liquid Fe as a function of pressure above the triple point, so to confirm changes in the compressibility and further investigate the possibility of this to be due to modification of the local structure.","1396":"Measuring and understanding the internal strain changes in response to the external pressure produces critical information to unveil the origin of unconventional\r\n behavior of crystalline materials in high-pressure environments. Moreover, defects in nano-crystals have a critical influence on the properties of nanocrystals\r\n where a single defect can completely modify the properties. Because of the close proximity of surfaces the energy and mobility of defects in nano-objects are\r\n borne to be very different from what they are in the bulk. The primary goal is the understanding of the defect behavior (creation, stability, annihilation, defect defect interaction) including the strain fields surrounding them in nano-objects under high-pressure. We propose to perform in-situ experiments combining High pressure and Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging, which has become the most effective technique for imaging the 3D structure of individual crystals.\r\n","1397":"As an archetypal diatomic molecule, the high-pressure polymorphs of molecular nitrogen are an excellent testbed for refining solid-state physics models. Above 110 GPa, the physicochemical properties of nitrogen radically change as it transforms into a polymeric single-bonded solid. It exhibits unique characteristics, such as the highest chemical energy storage and ultra-stiff bonds, compelling for the design of novel functional materials. This proposal aims to uncover nitrogen's phase diagram between 180 and 400 GPa, discover novel polymeric phases and solve their structure with single-crystal X-ray diffraction from polycrystalline samples (SC-XRDp). These experiments will challenge current theoretical models and unveil novel forms of polynitrogen arrangements, providing a rare, but crucial, example of the behavior of simple homoatomic systems at ultrahigh pressures.","1399":"As an archetypal molecular system, oxygen is one of the most studied elements at high pressures and features a surprisingly complex solid-state behavior. Stable from 10 GPa, the \u03b5-O2 phase is comprised of exotic (O2)4 units, and transforms into the \u03b6-O2 polymorph above 96 GPa. Observed up to the highest pressure attained on oxygen, 134 GPa, this molecular, metallic, and superconducting phase is of the utmost importance for fundamental condensed matter physics and earth sciences. Even though the crystal structure of \u03b6-O2 is a prerequisite for its understanding, it could not be refined due to insufficient data quality. In this proposal, single-crystal X-ray diffraction of polycrystalline samples (SC-XRDp), coupled with the EBS-ESRF fuelled ID27 beamline's exceptional capabilities, will be employed to unambiguously solve the crystal structure of \u03b6-O2 and unveil the phase diagram of oxygen up to 200 GPa.\r\n\r\n","1400":"The diamond anvil Raman phonon frequency shift at the interface with the sample is now currently used as a pressure measurement above 100 GPa for laboratory experiments. However, this spectroscopic pressure measurement could largely overestimate pressure above 400 GPa. The aim of this proposal is to accurately calibrate the Raman diamond pressure gauge up to 500 GPa. Three calibrants will be selected: Au, Pt and diamond, all embedded in Ne, by relating their XRD volumes to pressure through their EOS. The Raman shift of diamond under hydrostatic pressure, hence the diamond Gruneisen parameter, will also be measured up to 500 GPa. Toroidal-DACs will be used to reach the 500 GPa range.","1401":"Two or more liquid states may exist even for single-component substances, and the transition between these states is called a liquid-liquid transition (LLT). The LLT of phosphorus (P) has attracted considerable attention since the direct experimental observation of two fluid phases. However, several important questions remain, such as the variation of the density jump along the transition line, and whether the latter ends at a critical point (LLCP). Moreover, there are at present large discrepancies between different experimental measurements of the melting line, especially in the region of the LLT. The aim of this proposal is to explore the HP-HT phase diagram of P at pressure up to 4 GPa and temperature up to 3000 K, employing X-ray powder diffraction and absorption, to determine precisely the density change across the LLT and melting transitions, and extend the measurement of the LLT to higher T to check for the existence of a LLCP.","1402":"Na exhibits a variety of low-symmetry phases with complex structures above 100 GPa, and is reported to become an optically transparent insulator with fully localized valence electrons in the hP4 phase above 200 GPa. However, results from our recent ramp compression investigations do not agree with previous results, showing an additional diffraction peak. We firstly aim to resolve this discrepancy. One can furthermore determine the degree of electron localization from the intensity of the (002) peak. We will measure this intensity for the first time, providing the first direct evidence for the electride state in Na. Our result will also show whether Na behaves differently under dynamic compression than it does under static conditions.","1403":"We propose to study nano-scale density inhomogeneities in metallic glasses (MGs) and how they relate to the stability and mechanical properties of the glasses, using nano-tomography at ID16A. Recent studies have shown that density inhomogeneities on the length scale of ~100nm and up to 20% in magnitude exist in melt-quenched MGs. On the other hand, a family of vapor-deposited MGs have been found to exhibit a greater stability and an enhanced mechanical uniformity, but it remains to be seen how their structure differs on the nanoscale. In particular, it is unknown whether density inhomogeneities exist in these ultra-stable MGs, and if so, what is the level and length scale. Phase-contrast X-ray tomography at ID16A is well suited to answer this question thanks to its capability to detect low-level electron density fluctuations. The results are relevant to both the physical nature of the glass transition and industrial applications based on the mechanical properties of MGs.","1404":"The flexoelastic response of bent GaAs nanowires is planned to identify experimentally by measuring the change of the bending radius of single bent nanowires by a pump and probe experiment at beamline ID09 equipped with a fs laser. After the excitation of electrons the redistribution of charge carriers in the conduction band from the compressed to the expanded regions of the bent lattice will screen the radial electric field and will modify the radial strain gradient visible by a change of bending radius.","1405":"XPCS is expected to play a major role in the investigation of the glass transition and related phenomena at the atomic length-scale. Recently it was observed that the X-ray photons trigger structural rearrangements in oxide glasses well below the glass transition, inducing a spurious dynamics. We propose here to further elucidate the properties of this beam-induced dynamics, connecting it to the topological properties of the glassy network in order to use it as a fingerprint of the structure.","1406":"X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) is the only technique able to probe the slow atomic motion of glasses. Here, we aim to take advantage from the 30x increase in coherent flux of ID10 beamline at ESRF-EBS, to probe the wave vector dependence of the dynamics of metallic glass formers across the glass transition and in a previously unexplored spatial range, covering two orders of magnitude in wave vectors, Qs, from the macroscopic limit down to the atomic scale. From the Q-dependence of the structural relaxation time, \u03c4(Q), and of the shape parameter, \u03b2(Q), of the long-time decay of the intermediate scattering function (ISF) we will be able to unveil the mechanism responsible for particle motion across the glass transition and to compare it with results from recent numerical simulations and theoretical studies.","1407":"We propose to study the long-wavelength dynamics in glass-forming liquids using small-angle XPCS at ID10. The dynamics in glass-forming liquids shows a rich behavior depending on the length scale being considered. In particular, the intermediate Q-range between the hydrodynamic limit (Q \u2192 0) and the structure factor maximum (corresponding to interatomic distances) is largely unexplored and in need of experimental data for a better understanding. The successful operation of EBS should greatly facilitate XPCS measurements in this Q-range where scattering is weak. We propose to measure and compare several different metallic glass formers with various compositions, in order to disentangle the effects of concentration and density fluctuations on the dynamics of glass-forming liquids.","1408":"YbInCu4, has been studied extensively as an archetype example of first order valence transition (FOVT), as it was long known as the only stoichiometric compound exhibiting a FOVT at ambient pressure. The system has seen a recent surge in interest with the discovery of a tetragonal distortion through high energy x-ray diffraction, followed by an investigation of the Yb2+\/Yb3+ local environment through valence selective x-ray fluorescence holography, and a study of the correlation gap through ARPES.  Yet until now, all studies of the magnetic field induced FOVT in YbInCu4 with XRD, XAS, and XMCD have been limited to ambient pressure. Here we propose to simultaneously probe the electronic structure and the magnetic state of YbInCu4 across the field induced FOVT through XAS and XMCD at the Yb L3 edge under multi extreme conditions of temperature, field and pressure for the first time.\r\n","1409":" Iron oxides play a major role in the mineralogy of deep Earth and Super Earth exoplanets. The recent discovery of unexpected Fe-O stoichiometries at high pressures (P) and temperatures (T) questions our knowledge of the actual oxidation state of iron at mantle conditions. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) is highly sensitive to oxidation states and local environment and is thus particularly well-suited to tackle the question of spin transitions and valence state of iron under the very high pressures of planetary mantles. We propose to explore XANES at Fe K-edge of shock-compressed hematite (Fe2O3) and w\u00fcstite (FeO), the prototype Fe(III)- and Fe(II)-bearing iron oxide, for precising the nature of observed phase transitions, actual valence state of iron at high pressure, up to 500 GPa.","1410":"We combine EXAFS and VISAR measurements of shocked, initially porous Cu. Higher initial porosity leads to higher internal energy in the shocked state due to void collapse and therefore generates increasing temperature with increasing porosity. By varying the initial porosity, it is possible to make multiple Hugoniot measurements along an isochore and thus isolate thermal contributions to the compressed states. We will additionally constrain thermodynamic properties like the isochoric heat capacity. While this powerful technique dates back to the earliest days of dynamic compression, there exist no temperature data of shocked porous samples and almost no temperature data across the entirety of dynamically compressed solids.","1411":"We propose to perform the first-ever RIXS experiment at Ag L3 to study dd excitations in AgF2 single crystal, which has been recently predicted to become superconducting with an exceptionally high Tc of 200K if grown with a flat-layer structure different from the bulk one. Being able to use RIXS on it would be of the highest importance, in analogy to what has been done in the last decade of cuprates and iridates. Given some technical difficulties in handling AgF2 samples, and the availability of a medium resolution spectrometer for tender x-rays, ID26 is at present offering a unique opportunity to do this test experiment.\r\n\r\n","1412":"We propose to investigate the reaction kinetics, nucleation, and formation of ultrasmall Cu3N nanoparticles by one-pot solvothermal controlled synthesis using photon-in photon-out x-ray spectroscopy. The motivation of this work is to monitor the changes in the electronic structure during the reduction of Cu(II)methoxide to Cu(I) by benzylamine and consecutive transformation to Cu3N. The unique combination of both XES and XAS applied under realistic reaction condition will explain the nature and changes in the ligand\/species around absorbed atom.","1413":"MnFe(P,Si) is one of the rare examples presenting an isostructural first-order ferromagnetic magnetic transition (FOMT) at ambient conditions. Since the discovery of their giant magnetocaloric effect, this system attracts a continuing attention, both for its potential applications and for the scientific interest to unravel the underlying physical mechanism of the FOMT. Emission spectroscopy at Fe and Mn K\u03b2 edges, which can provide information on the local magnetic moments irrespectively of the magnetic order, is uniquely suited to address these questions. Therefore, we intend to measure the temperature dependence of Fe and Mn K\u03b2 XES spectra across the FOMT. In addition, to clarify the change in the electronic structure we will exploit the improved resolution offered by high energy resolution fluorescence detected in XAS, as well as the directionality of XES linear dichroism to pinpoint the change in the electronic density across the FOMT to specific orbitals.","1414":"The Metal Organic Framework, (NH4)Zn(HCO2)3 exhibits a transition to a ferroelectric state at 180 K. However, the triangular lattice on which dipoles sit suggests a degree of frustration in this transition. We have observed diffuse, planar maxima on our in-house instrument, which we believe to be associated with correlated disorder, as well as structured thermal diffuse scattering. To separate and understand these two contributions to the scattering, we propose to measure diffuse scattering and inelastic X-ray scattering (DS & IXS). This study has two main aims: (i) to understand the nature of static correlated disorder as a function of temperature and (ii) elucidate the interplay between correlated disorder and lattice dynamics in the system. Results will be compared with simulations using Monte Carlo and supercell lattice dynamics.","1415":"Signatures of nematic fluctuations have now been observed in various families of superconductors (SC) and have triggered intense investigations on the role of nematicity in the pairing mechanism. Recently, superconducting BaNi2(As,P)2 has received significant attention as a candidate system for charge-driven electronic nematicity. In this tetragonal system, a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) order sets in before a structural transition to a triclinic phase occurs. We have recently performed a combined diffuse scattering (DS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) study in BaNi2(As,P)2, in which we have identified the soft phonon responsible for the formation of the IC-CDW. Here we propose to complete our study by extending our measurements to higher P-doping levels, for which the triclinic transition is fully supressed, and the superconducting Tc is strongly increased. ","1416":"We propose to make the first 3D Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) reconstruction of a charge density waves (CDW) system in several small NbSe3 crystals with a volume less than 1\u03bcm3 prepared by electron-lithography. Using the high photon flux of the ESRF-EBS we will reconstruct both the (020) Bragg and the (0 1.241 0) satellite reflection associated to the CDW for several temperatures, going down to the second CDW transition at 59K. This would be the first 3D reconstruction of the CDW strain in an entire nano-particle and would pave the way toward the possibility of following the CDW 3D strain evolution under current.","1417":"The goal of this experiment is to study the CO2 and H2 adsorption\/desorption at the surface of single alloyed Ni crystals using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) under various in situ (temperature, T and pressure, p) conditions. The 3D intensity distribution in reciprocal space in the vicinity of a selected Bragg reflection contains information about the shape and strain states of the nanostructure, thus revealing insight into the nature of nanoscale deformation following chemical stimuli, such as adsorption of gases or changes in adsorbate structure. Here, we aim at imaging the strain evolution of pure Ni and alloyed NiFe particles as a function of CO2\/H2 gas pressure (from 100 mbar to 800 mbar) and temperature (from 300 K to 773 K). Ni-Fe particles have been demonstrated as the best candidates for an \u201call-inclusive\u201d material of choice for the carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction.","1418":"Methane plays a crucial role in the energy transition. As it is the second most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gas, it is crucial to ensure a complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and H2O. Already commercially in use, PdPt catalysts were found to be highly active for CH4 oxidation with a reported conversion of 10% at a temperature of only 200\u00b0C. From ensemble averaging experiments it is difficult to determine the nanoparticle near surface composition, which is detrimental for the establishment of structure \u2013 activity relationships. We therefore propose to use operando Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) to follow the structural evolution of single PdPt NPs during CH4 oxidation. We aim to relate shape and facet-resolved strain state changes in single NPs to the catalytic activity. Furthermore, we intent to identify NP surface facet sites and strain related surface compositions most relevant for methane oxidation for NPs with initial core-shell and alloy configuration.","1419":"Majorana zero-modes have been recently observed on superconductor\u2013semiconductor nanowire networks for quantum computing devices. Networks with novel nanocrossed architectures are being explored because the logical operation can be controlled at nanowire junctions by charge braiding. In this context, special attention is given to the fabrication of InSb nanowires networks due to its strong spin-orbit interaction, which turns the control of qubit states faster. So far, the influence of the nanocross formation in the crystalline structure has not been investigated. This proposal envisages the use of scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) to obtain information about the structural lattice distortions present in the junctions formed by different nanowire architectures. We also intend to record spatially resolved lattice features around the intersection points by SXDM using an in operando approach (bias voltage) at the ID01 beamline.","1420":"Spin Seebeck effect (SSE) has received notoriety for the next generation of magnetic device applications, with on-chip spintronic and thermoelectric functionalities. Understanding how crystal structure and strain are intertwined with the magnetic structure in devices is a crucial question underpinning SSE nanotechnology. This enigma could be resolved today thanks to the EBS upgrade, which provides sufficient hard X-ray coherent flux to develop the required tools.  We are pioneering a novel 3D magnetic Bragg ptychography microscopy to reveal precisely how crystalline strain causes the magnetic spin texture tuning, in technologically relevant SSE prototype devices structures.  This proposal builds on our preliminary results from experiment HC-4336, which have demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining magnetic ptychography reconstructions from the unique experiment set-up provided by ID01. We now require more beamtime to bring the quality of these results towards high impact publication.

Although state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy can provide useful information about the local polarization, much less is known about the response of these novel polar structures to temperature and applied electric field. To this end, we propose to use in-situ scanning x-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) at ID01 to study the evolution under applied field, at various temperatures, of the unusual domain structure appearing in in-plane polarised PbTiO3\/SrTiO3 (PTO\/STO) superlattices grown on DyScO3 substrates.","1423":"We would like to carry out high-pressure x-ray diffraction measurements on single crystals of two Fe(II) spin-crossover complexes: Fe(PM\u2013AzA)2(NCS)2, (PM-aza =N-(2'-pyridylmethylene)-4-(azophenyl) aniline), and on two polymorphs of Fe(PM-Bia)2(NCS)2 (PM-Bia=N-(2'- pyridylmethylene)-4-amino-bi-phenyl) using our newly designed compact diamond anvil cells (DACs) with a wide 110\u00b0 opening angle. Measurements will be realized up to a pressure of 2.2 GPa with a pressure resolution of 0.1-0.2 GPa. The measurements will provide a detailed picture of changes in the crystal structures from high spin to low spin states in the first compound and allow characterizing the pressure-induced phase transition between the two polymorphs of the latter compound. \r\n","1424":"The aim of this project is to investigate the evolution of the crystallographic phase and detailed coordination environment of non-stochiometric inorganic halide perovskite powders upon heating under high vacuum (<10-6 mbar), mimicking the conditions during deposition by thermal evaporation.

Ferroelectrics being non-centrosymmetric materials, the photostriction is expected to behave similarly to the so-called bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), despite other mechanisms (e.g., thermal expansion) at play. In this proposal, our objective is to investigate how this strain depends on crystal orientation and light polarization, particularly to identify the characteristic signature of the BPVE. Our approach, we already proven in a previous experiment (HC-4561), is to measure the full strain tensor under the above bandgap illumination by Laue micro-diffraction.

Precisely, we target the first realization of a ferromagnetic Janus 2D material, whose novel electronic\/magnetic properties are expected to impact the field of spintronics. As shown in our previous studies of SPtSe [1], grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) is well suited to monitor in situ the formation of a Janus TMD, and to determine its atomic structure quantitatively. Here, GIXD will allow monitoring the substitution of the top Te layer of a Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) single layer by S and Se, thanks to exposure to atomic fluxes of the corresponding elements.","1427":"This proposal aims to investigate epitaxial, 2D thin films of MoS2, a prototypical transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor with potential applications in nanoelectronics.

To better understand the distinct growth behaviour and epitaxial model, a detailed structural analysis of the surfaces and interfaces is proposed by in-plane GIXD and out-of-plane XRR studies.\r\nMoreover, an in situ study involving thermal annealing of MoS2\/Al2O3 samples in H2S-atmosphere can simulate S-rich reaction conditions and monitor evolution of the topmost sapphire surface and MoS2\/Al2O3 interface. These experiments will gain a fundamental understanding of the impact of sapphire surface reconstruction, which is expected to play a crucial role in the vdW epitaxy of TMDs.\r\n","1428":"The overarching goal is to represent 3D microstructures through appropriate graphs to apply graph neural networks (GNN) approaches for high cycle fatigue damage prediction. These GNN methods facilitate comparatively physical modeling of polycrystalline materials and can potentially learn characteristic interactions at the microstructural scale, e.g. dislocation pile up at grain boundaries (GB). Especially in high-cycle fatigue, the microstructure sensitivity in fatigue is pronounced, leading to the requirement of comprehensive microstructural feature space, only attainable by 3D microtexture data. Therefore, DCT is supposed to be applied ex-situ (before and after fatigue) on eight specimens to capture the GB plane orientation and phase-contrast measurements to identify internal defects such as pores and inclusions. The multimodal data will be registered with experimental data from our tailored bending resonance fatigue apparatus and finally used for graph modeling and learning.\r\n\r\n","1429":"We propose here to investigate the structural changes occurring in different Pd42.5Cu27Ni19.5P21 and \r\nPt42.5Cu27Ni19.5P21 metallic glass formers obtained from quenching the corresponding supercooled liquids \r\nunder different high pressure treatments. Our recent dynamical studies have revealed a surprising \r\nacceleration of the atomic motion in these densified glasses which persists even heating the samples in the \r\nequilibrium supercooled phase. This behaviour suggests the occurrence of an irreversible pressure-induced \r\nliquid-liquid polyamorphic transition during the sample preparation.

We will study systems irradiated with different photon energies, investigating the effect of radiolysis and knock-on events.","1431":"Laser peening is a surface treatment technique that improves the mechanical performance of metals used to extend fatigue life and to enhance fatigue strength. Most studies on laser peening have used nanosecond pulsed lasers, which require a sacrificial coating as well as a transparent overlay, while recent studies reported that femtosecond laser peening does not need any protective layer. The physical process is very complex and requires a multi-physics approach. To validate model predictions high spatial-resolution microstructure data are needed to compare the dislocation density in the depth of the material with the estimated density from the local pressure in the shockwave. Five different metals will be considered. The experimental result will help understanding the modeling of this very complex process and open the path for optimal surface treatment processes using fs lasers.","1433":"RNiO3 nickelates are referent materials to study the evolution of the physical properties at the crossover from localized to itinerant behavior in highly correlated electron systems. The subtle competition between bandwidth (related to Ni-O-Ni distortion), on-site electron-electron repulsion (U), and charge transfer energy between O and Ni sites produces multiple entangled order parameters in RNiO3. Both, the exact mechanism that drives their unusual MIT as well as the multiferroic properties of the insulating magnetic phase are still under debate. In RNiO3 (R=Yb, Y, Dy and Nd, varying the Ni-O-Ni distortion and the charge disproportionation degree) we aim to investigate their low-temperature structures. Very recent Raman studies have revealed new modes across TN unveiling subtle structural changes induced by spin ordering.   They have great importance for the magnetic and multiferroic properties of RNiO3 compounds and heterostructures.","1434":"Ball milling is widely used in the pharmaceutical field as a simple and effective way to reduce the grain sizes of powders. However, milling is also able to induce transformations towards metastable polymorphic forms, which has generally a strong repercussions on the bioavailability of drugs, i.e. on their efficiency. The aim of this project is to determine the mechanisms driving these transformations which are still unknown. This should greatly improve the control of the physical state of the drugs during pharmaceutical processes and thus their therapeutic performances. For this, we will take advantage of the high-time, high-angular and spatial resolution of synchrotron beam to study in situ, and thus in real time, the kinetics of the polymorphic transformation of Sulfamerazine, a widely used sulfonamide antibacterial drug, upon milling. ","1436":"The proposed project complements our investigation on binary Cu3-xTe2 (x = 0-0.18) telluride, a synthetic analogue of naturally occurring mineral rickardite.  While we recently published the physical properties results, the respective structural behavior of the investigation phase at relevant temperatures (from RT up  to 733 K) remains undefined. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the structural behaviour of Cu3-xTe2 at high temperatures to establish the relationship  between the structural changes and their effects observed during the examination of physical properties.","1437":"The proposed project is a part of our systematic investigations of binary systems containing transtition metal and main group element, including crystal structure determination, phase transitions study, physical properties measurements, chemical bonding calculations. The results obtained at ESRF and specially at ID22 contributed successfully to these studies (e.g. proposals HS4271, HS4823, HC3349). The aim of the present proposal is in-situ investigation of phase and structural behaviour of FeGe in the temperature range 500\uf02d850 C in order to understand the mechanism of the structural transition in this system. The preliminary investigations gave us indications that the existence ranges, phase transition behavior and peculiarities of the crystal structures of three modifications of FeGe deviate from those reported in the literature","1438":"We suppose that accurate temperature dependent high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction (XPD) measurements in order to study an unusual effect of crystal structure transformation just metastable(!)  multi-valence(!)

Up to now, superconductivity has not been found in any bulk sample with identical composition. In fact, the synthesis process involves a critical topochemical reduction which introduces defects (remaining oxygen atoms, Ni vacancies\u2026), maybe at a higher level in bulk materials, which could be at the origin of the absence of superconductivity. We want to quantify these defects at 300 K by XRD (and neutron diffraction, related proposal actually evaluated) at ID22 beamline of ESRF in our bulk (Nd1-xCax)NiO2 samples, insulating at low T, where doping is introduced by Ca2+ doping. We propose also to measure high resolution XRD patterns in the 5-300 K range to determine the crystal structure at low T and look for possible structural transitions maybe linked to the spin-glass like behavior detected around T* = 6K \u2013 18K in magnetization.","1440":"High-\/medium-entropy alloys (H\/MEAs) are characterized by severe lattice distortion due to the intrinsic atomic size mismatch between the multiple constituent elements, which is thus considered as the main contribution of outstanding mechanical performance. Akin to the traditional amorphous alloys, atomic-level stress dominates the topological instability of strongly disordered systems. Thereby, HEA\u2019s propensity to distort lattice becomes more striking as the disorder is increased. It is irrefutable to raise the amorphous HEA, however, there are hitherto few related reports, let alone to the study of structure and property. In our work, we prepare an amorphous CrMnFeCoNi HEA by deposition method and find a topological change from amorphous to crystalline state at high pressure. However, the fundamental structure and temperature sensitivity of the initial amorphous HEA remains intricate. Here, we aim to reveal the structural nature through the pair distribution function analysis.","1441":"This proposal is a resubmission of HC 4373 whose only the XANES part under high pressure (HP) has been achieved due to the repair of the 8 T cryomagnet suitable for HP XMCD. Its main aims is to probe the magnetic phases that occur above 1.5 GPa using HP XMCD at the U \u2013 M4,5 edges.","1442":"The project aims to reveal and understand magnetic H-T-phase diagram of FeRh in fields up to 17 T and temperatures down to 3 K. In particular: (a) phase transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase and verify the existence of critical point; (b) phase transition from antiferromagnetic collinear to antiferromagnetic non-collinear phase and reveal if there is a triple point, at which these three phases co-exist. Although the magnetic order is defined and fully dominated by the spins of Fe, it is expected that the magnetic state of Rh plays in all these phase transitions the decisive role. Hence we propose XMCD experiments aiming to detect magnetic moments of both Fe and Rh. Revealing a phase diagram can significantly improve our understanding of the magnetic phase transitions. Moreover, the ways of the emergence of ferromagnetism by heating in the special case of FeRh strongly influences the development of magnetic data storage devices.","1443":"We have recently reported strong anomalous Hall effect in heterostructures of non-magnetic SrIrO3 (SIO) and ferromagnetic LaCoO3 (LCO) which demonstrated proximity-induced ferromagnetism in SIO. This has been demonstrated to arise from interfacial charge transfer from Ir to Co, which we propose to investigate further using detailed temperature dependent Ir L- edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at beam line ID12 on a selection of high quality SIO\/LCO heterostructures. Our aim is specifically to investigate the changes of the local electronic and magnetic structure of interfacial Ir ions, and in particular to check possible break-down of the pseudo-spin scenario. Additionally, we aim at gaining fresh insights at the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) \u2013 which is generally both of fundamental and technological interest - and its relation to oxygen octahedral rotations. ","1444":"MnFe(P,Si) is one of the rare materials presenting an isostructural first-order ferromagnetic magnetic transition at ambient conditions. This system attracts a\r\ncontinuous attention, both for its potential applications and for the scientific interest to unravel the underlying transition mechanism. The debate on the nature\r\nof the changes in electronic structure continues up to today. (Non-magnetic) X-ray linear dichroism which can provide element selective and orbital specific\r\ninformation on electron occupation is uniquely suited to address this issue. Taking advantage of our recent achievements on growing MnFe(P,Si) single crystals, we intend to measure Fe, Mn and foremost P K-edge linear dichroic XLD spectra across the ferromagnetic transition.","1445":"AlFe2B2 is a nano-layered boride which exhibits a strong magneto-caloric effect (MCE) as well as a room temperature ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition . This compound has attracted a lot of attention due to its potential application for magnetic refrigeration, similarly to Gd5Si2Ge2 . We wish to investigate the local electronic and magnetic properties of AlFe2B2 as a function of pressure by using high pressure XLD and XMCD at the Fe K edge. This will help shed a new light on the MCE in this phase and it could allow us to uncover any potential change of the valence state of Fe atoms at high pressure. ","1446":"The aim of this proposal is to quantitavely determine with high accuracy the pressure dependence of the U 5f orbital and spin moments and their ratio in the\r\nferromagnetic URhGa. The measurements of magnetic and thermodynamic properties led to conclude that the Curie temperature initially increases whereas the\r\nsaturation moment decreases. This is a rather unexpected behavior for UTX (T- transition metal, X- p element) compounds. A vanishing U 5f is expected to\r\noccur at about 17 GPa. The vanishing U moment could be due either to a compensation of the orbital and spin contribution or to the occurence of a non- magnetic ground state. We propose to measure XMCD under pressure at the U M4,5 edges to conclude between these two scenarios.","1447":"Vertically aligned wurtzite ZnO nanowires doped with Cu are investigated by X-ray Natural Linear Dichroism. XNLD measurements performed at the Cu and Zn K-edges will allow us to probe the charge anisotropy of the empty 4p states and with the help of FDMNES simulations to provide information on the local environment surrounding the Cu dopants. Those measurements done on as-grown samples under different pH conditions will give us a deep insight into the physicochemical processes during the formation of ZnO NWs and the related copper incorporation mechanisms which will open the way for carefully controlling their physical properties as required for nanoscale device engineering.","1448":"With X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ir-L edge, we want to investigate heterostructures made from the cuprate high Tc superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and Sr2IrO4 (SIO) that is a weak Mott-insulator with AF order and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, we will study how the charge transfer and orbital reconstruction at the YBCO\/SIO interface influences the electronic\/magnetic ground states. This information will provide important clues about the mechanism of the anomalous spin\/charge coupling at the YBCO\/SIO interface that results in a giant directional asymmetry of the superconducting and magneto-resistive response. In combination with XAS experiments at the Cu-L3 edge, we will be able to understand the magnetic and superconducting proximity effects at these interfaces.","1449":"The aim of the study is the understanding of magnetic coupling and resulting electronic changes in the atomically-layered magnetic (Mn1-xCrx)2GaC MAX phase system. Due to complex non-collinear antiferromagnetic coupling driven by competing antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) interlayer exchange over the Ga layer, a rich phase diagram has been obtained. For Mn2GaC, this is accompanied by huge magnetostriction (450 ppm in 3 T) with sign inversion at the 1st order phase transition around 220 K. Substituting Cr for Mn weakens the interlayer coupling resulting in reduced ordering temperatures from ~500 K for Mn2GaC to ~200 K for (Mn0.5Cr0.5)2GaC and already moderate external fields (~0.3 T) can break the AFM coupling between FM ordered (Mn,Cr)-C-(Mn,Cr) sheets. Laboratory-based structural and magnetic studies have risen the hypothesis that the coupling depends on the local Mn environment which should be addressed by hard X-ray Linear Dichroism (XLD) and XMCD.","1450":"The strange metal phase, one of the grand challenges of strongly correlated systems, generally occurs close to a quantum critical point (QCP). This picture is also accepted in HTS: a QCP is postulated at p*, where the pseudogap ends at T\u21920. This scenario is overturned by recent experiments, hinting at a subordinal role of pseudogap. This either implies the absence of a QCP, or the presence of a QCP having different origin. To unravel this puzzle, we propose to study with RIXS charge density fluctuations (CDF), which permeate the strange metal at p<p*, in overdoped YBCO and Bi2212. CDF have been associated to the strange metal, and at p* have highest intensity and minimum energy. This hints to their active role in forming a QCP at p*. To confirm this, we will check if CDF are present also at p>p* and, if so, their doping dependence. The results will tell us if the HTS physics is connected to a quantum critical scenario, and if CDF are the quantum fluctuations related to the QCP.","1451":"Besides transverse and vortex magnetic domain walls, a third type of domain wall has been predicted, and observed in 2D in permalloy nanostrips. We propose to use Fourier transform holography, with our recent developments towards magnetic tomography, to image the 3D structure of this new type of domain walls and compare the results with the published model.","1452":"Fe5GeTe2 is one of the van der Waals ferromagnets with the highest Curie temperature. Its doping with Co is known to induce magnetic easy-axis\/easy-plane\r\nand ferromagnetic\/antiferromagnetic transitions. So far, only total magnetization measurements have been reported. Here, we propose to use X-ray magnetic\r\ncircular dichroism (XMCD) and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) to determine the elemental magnetic moments and clarify the local magnetic order in\r\n(Fe1-xCox)5GeTe2 thin films with various compositions.","1453":"The fascinating properties of high Tc superconducting cuprates are often attributed to the peculiar entwining of sev-eral degrees of freedom (charge density and anisotropy, spin, lattice modes). This implies that the corresponding excitations all have comparable energies, lying in the mid (<500 meV) and far infrared range (<100 meV), and are often of mixed character. Aside to the low energy region, RIXS spectra are dominated by the dd excitations, which are often dismissed as uninteresting. However, two recent experiments are now hinting to band-like effects occurring in the dd excitations of cuprates. We propose to measure the azimuthal (\u03c6) dependence of the dd excitations in the striped cuprate LSCO, at different doping levels, to confirm the existence of unexpected jumps in the dd intensi-ty. The doping, temperature and q dependence of these discontinuities will confirm if this effect is band-like, possi-bly telling us which low energy order is involved in this phenomenology.","1454":"Van der Waals (vdw) materials with magnetic order have emerged as highly intriguing flatforms for new quantum states. Especially notable is the discovery of Zhang-Rice excitons. Although these states have been shown to exist, the way they propagate within a crystal is entirely unknown, even though this information is important for their role in, for example, novel magneto-optical effects that are currently being explored quite intensely. In this proposal, we will use ultra-high energy resolution Ni L3-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to measure the exciton dispersion in the vdw antiferromagnet NiPS3 and determine a detailed model describing their propagation.","1455":"The electronic configuration of Cu (3d9) ions in low-dimensional cuprates is such that the electron hole is generally found in the eg 3d(x2-y2)-orbital instead of the 3d(3z2-r2). Remarkably, the quasi-1D Mott-insulator CuSb2O6 shows fairly regular CuO6 octahedra that seem to promote a close competition between the 3z2-r2 and x2-y2 levels that leads to a unusual orbital ordering with mixed character. This mixed character orbital ordering still lacks experimental cerification. Therefore, we propose to establish this unusual orbital ordering in CuSb2O6 by a series of momentum dependent RIXS experiments. Additionally, this unusual orbital configuration may provide new pathways for electron-phonon interaction in cuprates. Indeed, our group reported evidence by Raman scattering of low-energy electronic excitations in CuSb2O6 single crystals that strongly interact with phonons of similar energy that also lacks experimental verification by RIXS","1456":"Hall effect and quantum oscillation measurements on high temperature cuprate superconductors show that underdoped compositions have small Fermi surface pockets whereas when heavily overdoped, a single much larger pocket is found.  It has been proposed that the origin of this change in electronic structure is related to the closing of the pseudogap. Our recent ID32 experiment shows that the clean overdoped single-layer cuprate Tl2Ba2CuO6+\u03b4 (Tl2201) displays charge density wave (CDW) order with a remarkably long correlation length \u03be\u2248200 \u00c5 which disappears above a hole doping p_(CDW )\u22480.265. We have proposed that the evolution of the electronic properties of Tl2201 as the doping is lowered may be due to growth of the CDW gap below p_(CDW )rather than the opening of the pseudogap.  To test this hypothesis, we propose to measure how the CDW in Tl2201 evolves with doping.","1457":"The intermetallic type-I clathrate CeBa7Au6Si40 exhibits unusual properties, in particular a strongly enhanced thermopower compared to its Ce-free counterpart. This has been attributed to the compound\u2019s Kondo temperature being boosted by the thermal population of \u201crattling\u201d phonon modes. Here we intend to scrutinize this picture using temperature dependent RIXS at the Ce M5 edge","1458":"Charge density wave (CDW) order was observed in all cuprate families and most studies to date showed that CDW correlations are confined to the underdoped regime. However, recent studies revealed the presence of CDW even in the overdoped regime. Our group recently succeeded in growing high quality thin films of La2-xCaxCuO4 (LCCO) in the overdoped regime with dopings up to x = 0.5 and observed that superconductivity surprisingly persists even at such high dopings, with Tc ~ 20 K at x = 0.5.  Here, we propose to carry out high-resolution Cu-L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on these LCCO thin films to investigate the presence of CDW order and provide a conclusion as to whether the CDW  in the overdoped regime is a universal feature of cuprate supercondcutors.","1459":"Topological materials (TMs) have attracted great research interest with the promise of developing novel electronic devices with new functionalities. Among these materials, MnBi2Te4 is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (TI) that can experimentally achieve quantized edge conductance at certain thicknesses. Here, we propose a systematic study on the magnetism of the extended TI family of MnBi2Te4, i.e., (MnTe)m(Bi2Te3)n, which all possess topologically protected surface states. Further, by substitutional replacement of Bi with Sb, the surface Dirac point can be moved close to the Fermi level, allowing for tracking the interplay between doping and magnetic properties. This composition-ratio dependent study will help to reveal the intimate relation between topology and magnetism in intrinsic magnetic TIs, and therefore promote the development of high-efficiency spintronic applications in TMs.","1460":"Aim of the proposal is to perform EXAFS analyses on pure CeO2 and six different samples belonging to the Ce1-x(Nd0.74Tm0.26)xO2-x\/2 system (x= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6), in order to understand the relationship between the ionic conductivity and the local structure. In fact, the Ce1-xRExO2-x\/2 systems (RE= trivalent rare earth ion) are characterized by high ionic conductivity at low dopant amount in the 773-973 K temperature range. This property is strictly related to the structural features and to the presence of defect aggregates. Due to their outstanding ionic conductivity, these compounds are investigated for applications as electrolytes in solid oxide cells working in the intermediate temperature range (IT-SOCs), devices that allow the production and storage of energy in a more sustainable way.","1461":"The goal of this proposal is to use X-ray absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) to investigate the electronic and structural properties of Ga atoms in series of novel Ga doped epitaxial SiGe and pure Ge epitaxial layers grown on Si that hold great promise for the development of next generation ultra-scaled p-type MOSFETs devices. This investigation will provide a better understanding of the electronic and structural properties of the Ga-based defect complexes formed in the SiGe and Ge lattices during chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as a function of the Ga concentration. Additionally, the structure of the superficial segregated Ga phases obtained at high Ga concentrations will be investigated. This will be used as input parameter to guide further the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic properties and local environment of the different Ga-defect complexes formed (e.g.: Ga-vacancy, Ga-Si\/Ge interstitials, Ga clusters).","1462":"SnSe is a new key thermoelectric material that exhibits an ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity. This is a unique phenomenon among reported TE materials; however, its origin remains highly debated. Several scenarios have been proposed among the most likely one, but not completely accepted, relates the low \u03baT to a highly anisotropy in the phonon scattering. This may be related to the Sn\u2013Se bond anharmonicity and anisotropy. This kind of information with a local character and dependence on the solid's vibrational properties could be only accessed by spectroscopies at local-range, as the case of EXAFS or Raman. We propose to study the bond anharmonicity and anisotropy in binary SnSe using high-quality EXAFS under isobaric condition in DAC and cryostat from 2 to 300 K at HP (100 GPa). These data will improve our knowledge on the features of the intrinsic low thermal conductivity in SnSe at non-ambient conditions and will have a high impact for further developments in thermoelectrics.","1463":"The Invar effect, observed in ferromagnetic bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), cannot be explained by existing theories because the BMGs lack the crystalline structure. High-pressure high-temperature Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) experiments will reveal whether the Invar effect in amorphous materials is also accompanied by a spin-volume correlation. It will shed light on the pressure-induced atomic rearrangement and why the Invar effect is universal in BMGs but rare in crystalline materials. Furthermore, it is possible via the Invar effect to determine the pressure-dependence of the Curie temperature and to quantify the magnetic contribution to thermal expansion.  ","1464":"Rare-earth A2Zr2O7 zirconates have been generally considered to crystallize with either long range ordered pyrochlore structure or disordered defect-fluorite structure, empirically depending on the size ratio between A and Zr cations. However, on a local scale, the \u2018defect-fluorite\u2019 members of the series have been discussed to reveal a lower-symmetry structure. Recently, our neutron and x-ray pair-distribution function studies of local structure correlations in the series suggested that the short-range environment of the nominally \u2018defect-fluorite\u2019 members is similar to the rhombohedral structure of the end-member Lu2Zr2O7. To unambiguously reveal subtle structural aspects in the A2Zr2O7 series, our PDF results are still to be corroborated by other local-environment sensitive techniques, namely the proposed EXAFS experiment.","1465":"In the search of new materials for energy applications based on abundant elements, intermetallic silicides based on alkaline metals will be of high interest. Using DFT calculations, we found the possibility to obtain two different polymorphs of NaSi2 at high pressure with potential for both batteries and thermoelectricity.\r\nWe propose to investigate the formation under high pressure and high temperature (HP-HT) of the two different polymorphs of NaSi2 with monoclinic and cubic structures predicted to be stable at high pressure using HP-HT X-Ray diffraction at ID06-LVP ESRF beamline of the ESRF. This will also permit us to investigate their existence domain in P,T space and the pressure dependence of their volume when decreasing the pressure at room temperature. The use of large volumepress will permit us to further study these phases in our laboratory.","1467":"Kitaev systems have attracted a lot of attention this last decade as they have been theoretically predicted to exhibit a very exotic and intriguing quantum phase of matter called a quantum spin liquid phase, where no magnetic order occurs but rather a strong quantum entanglement between particles, usually characterized by fractionalized excitations. \r\nSome strong spin-orbital entangled Jeff = 1\/2 honeycomb systems such as Na2IrO3 exhibit such Kitaev interactions. However they have been shown to magnetically order due to other interactions driving those systems away from the pure Kitaev case. These interactions are strongly believed to arise from the distortions of the Ir-O-Ir angles away from 90\u00b0.  Here we propose to perform a high precision diffraction experiment on NaIr2O3 under uniaxial strain to probe how the atomic positions and those angles are affected.","1468":"Models for the internal structure of the icy satellites Ganymede and Titan suggest that both moons are differentiated with a hydrosphere of ices and liquid water overlaying an inner rocky core. The presence of significant amounts of Insoluble Organic Matter (IOM) in this silicate layer has recently been advanced to properly explain the density and moment of inertia of these moons. The evolution of the IOM at the elevated temperatures (T \u2264 800 K) inside icy worlds could have a defining impact on their habitability and chemical evolution, including the formation of an atmosphere. However, the effect on these thermal reactions of the high pressures (P \u2264 10 GPa) found inside planetary environments remains largely unknown. We propose to use in situ powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), on diamond anvil cell samples of IOM and water, to establish a comprehensive picture of the fate of the primordial organic matter during the differentiation process in large icy moons.","1469":"The goal of this proposal is to characterize the structural evolution as a function of pressure at room temperature of three different 2D metal halide perovskites of general formula A2PbBr4 containing three different linear amines on the A-site of the structure characterized by increasing chain length, namely hexylammonium (C6), decylammonium (C10) and hexadecylammonium (C16). The structural study will be coupled to the spectroscopic measurements as a function of pressure, such as absorbance and photoluminescence, to fully characterize the behaviour of these low dimensional hybrid perovskites upon compression and unveil the role of organic spacer length on structural stability and optical properties.","1470":"Hydrogen uptake by a metal drastically increases under high hydrogen pressure. New polyhydrides compounds are interesting as H-storage materials and hold great promise as high temperature superconductors. Pressures in the 100 GPa range have to be applied and unfortunately none of these novel Metal-Hydrogen compounds is metastable at ambient pressure. Hence, there is now great interest to form such H-rich compounds at high pressure and to recover them at ambient pressure by adding a third element. The aim of this proposal is to show that searching for ternary hydrides is indeed a good strategy. We performed ab-initio calculations showing that YFe2H10 is predicted to form at about 20 GPa and that it could be recovered metastable at ambient pressure. YFe2 alloy will be compressed in excess hydrogen and the formation of YFe2Hx compounds will be characterized by a detailed structural study at various pressures. The metastability of the YFe2H at ambient pressure will be investigated.","1471":"We will study pressure-induced structural transformations in RuBr3 and RuI3, the new van der Waals magnets. At ambient pressure, these compounds form chain-like structures where short Ru-Ru bonds prevent the Ru3+ ions from being magnetic. A high-pressure high-temperature treatment transforms both compounds into layered and magnetic polymorphs that are promising hosts for the Kitaev spin liquid and other exotic quantum phenomena. We seek to study details of this transformation by high-pressure x-ray diffraction. We will map out the different polymorphs of RuBr3 and RuI3 and their stability range as a function of pressure and temperature. This will help us to determine the pressure region where Ru3+ retains its magnetism. We will also establish optimal conditions for the synthesis of magnetic polymorphs of RuBr3 and RuI3. Our study will contribute to the knowledge of pressure-induced transformations and dimensional crossover in transition-metal trihalides as van der Waals magnets.","1473":"We propose to apply methods of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) in laser-heated DACs in order to determine crystal structures and chemical compositions of possible high-pressure phase(s) in W-B system up to 150 GPa. ","1474":"Oxygen is a unique element, with the only known molecular magnet and with very small compact valence orbitals allowing the short double chemical bond in the oxygen molecule. Remarkably, oxygen exhibits a richer phase diagram than other diatomic molecular systems. To date, the structural investigation of oxygen under pressure has been limited to 133 GPa and the structural characterization of the metallic transition about 100 GPa has been disclosed by single-crystal X-ray microdiffraction.  The structural evolution of metallic phase of solid oxygen and the possibility of inducing a molecular dissociation in the solid state remain totally unknown. With this proposal, we will explore to pressures exceeding 300 GPa, by single crystal X-ray microdiffraction, the phase stability of the metallic phase and uncover other possible phases and crystalline structures of very dense solid oxygen. ","1476":"This proposal is a continuation of proposal HC-4677 which aimed at measuring the boundary line between bcc insulating and fcc-superionic (fcc-SI) phases of ice. A sample assembly with two boron-doped diamond absorbers has been optimized and it enabled a controlled laser heating of the ice sample up to 200 GPa. A negative slope for the bcc to fcc-SI transition and a metastable quenched fcc-SI phase at ambient temperature have been observed. That hints to the stability of the fcc-SI phase below 1000K by going to 300 GPa. Also, compact phases with greater packing density than bcc should be observed by compressing water ice up to 400 GPa at 300K. We plan to continue the exploration of the detailed structural properties of dense water ice above 200 GPa. These are very challenging measurements of great impact to model planetary interiors of Uranus, Neptune\r\nand other ice giant exoplanets.\r\n","1477":"BaNi2As2 exhibits a variety of structural and electronic phases which can easily be tuned by chemical substitution. These include a superconducting phase as well as an incommensurate and commensurate charge density wave (IC-, C-CDW) in an orthorhombic and triclinic structure, respectively. The recent observation of an electronic nematic phase by elastoresistance measurements and linking of the IC-CDW to the orthorhombic phase suggest that this system could be very efficiently tuned by uniaxial pressure, as supported by recent model calculations. Here, we propose to investigate the uniaxial pressure dependence of the various phases of BaNi2As2. ","1479":"It is now evident that many materials feature superconducting phases when a CDW phase is suppressed by extrinsic parameters such as pressure or intercalation in layered materials. However, studies in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) found that the phase space of emergent superconductivity is not close to the CDW quantum critical point. Here, we propose to determine the CDW quantum critical point in 2H-TaSe2 under pressure via x-ray diffraction (XRD). Based on our ambient-pressure study of the soft phonon mode at the CDW transition in 2H-TaSe2 (unpublished) and published resistivity measurements, we argue that this compound likely has a CDW quantum critical point closely connected to the emergent superconducting phase and could be a textbook example where both phases are mediated by the same mechanism, electron-phonon coupling of the CDW soft phonon mode. Our study will determine the CDW phase diagram in its most crucial but still unexplored area. ","1480":"This proposal aims to extend the melting curve and phase diagram exploration of gold into the multi-megabar range. Due to its exceptional chemical inertness and structural stability, gold is a widely used high pressure standard and is an important material in many applications. Using an elaborate sample geometry, we were able to measure the melt line of gold up to 110 GPa. With the upgrade of the ESRF, it is now possible to further pursue these measurements in the multi-megabar range and compare with recent shock wave experiments performed at the APS synchrotron.","1481":"Recently, our group has shown the existence of multiple critical cooling rates which generate different types of monolithic metallic glasses. Via fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC), using a Au-based MG as an example, we proved that MGs should be classified into two types of amorphous\/monolithic glass. The first type, termed self-doped glass (SDG), forms quenched-in nuclei or nucleation precursors upon cooling, whereas in the so-called chemically homogeneous glass (CHG) no quenched-in structures are found. Although the kinetics of these processes and the stability of the crystalline structures were established, there is no direct observation of the structural changes. These changes will be investigated by analyzing in-situ X-ray diffraction data (reciprocal space or direct space, i.e. pair distribution functions) as recorded with a fast detector upon rapid heating and cooling with the help of a FDSC chip sensor.","1482":"In this proposal, we would like to carry out anomalous x-ray scattering (AXS) experiments on La-Ni-Al metallic glasses (MG) to obtain the relationship between the rejuvenation effect by a temperature cycling and the changes in the local atomic structures. Our recent AXS experiments reveal that small but distinct structural changes were observed by the rejuvenation effect with a temperature cycling even in the first neighboring peaks in a Gd65Co35 MG. Concerning the present MG samples, Ketov et al. [1] predicted the presence of such an effect in the context of structural and elastic heterogeneities by the cryogenic rejuvenation. We expect to clarify that the structural changes occur universally in MGs by the rejuvenation effect, although depending on the extent of structural and\/or elastic heterogeneity in MGs.\r\n","1483":"Strained thin films of SrTiO3 perovskite possess a paraelectric to ferroelectric (FE) phase transition which is suppressed in bulk SrTiO3 due to quantum fluctuations. Although the stabilization of ferroelectric SrTiO3 has a significant technological relevance, it is still poorly explored. With this proposal we aim to study two aspects of the FE transition in SrTiO3: the formation and evolution of ferroelectric domains (if any), and the understanding of the competition between the FE transition and a ferroelastic antiferrodistortive (AFD) transition which occurs independently in SrTiO3. To do that, we propose to perform a cryogenic diffraction experiment at BM02 for SrTiO3 thin films grown under a range of biaxial strain, spanning from compressive (grown on NdGaO3 substrates) to tensile (grown on DyScO3 substrates), which will help us unravel the associated structural modifications and domains formation in SrTiO3 thin films.

The measurements will be made on SrTiO3:Nb substrates, a very common substrate used for growth of thin- films, that can efficiently absorb the picosecond laser pulse and launch a ring-shaped surface shock-wave that acoustically focuses at the center of the ring where the pressure jumps very substantially. We intend to track the x-ray diffraction peaks shifts that correspond to in-plane shock stresses characteristics of standard surface (non-linear) acoustic waves. These studies will unveil the onset of the shock focusing and enable a very accurate calibration of the shock stresses for futur experiments on thin films of correlated materials deposited on SrTiO3:Nb substrates. ","1485":"Tellurium shows many interesting properties, but our knowledge about the amorphous solid state of Te is limited, mostly due to its spontaneous crystallization at room temperature. It has recently been demonstrated that amorphization can be induced in Te by ultrafast optical lasers, but no structural information of this amorphized phase has been reported. Thus, we propose to study laser-amorphized Te using optical pump, X-ray probe at ID09. We aim at measuring the WAXS pattern of the laser-amorphized Te and studying its temperature dependence. Our results will reveal details on the structure of amorphous Te, possibly over a wide temperature range, which will provide crucial information to understand the thermodynamic and structural behaviors of Te.","1486":" Unravelling the connection between the macroscopic properties of glasses and their amorphous structure is probably one of the hardest as well as the most rewarding task to pursue, in condensed matter.  The employment of chalcogenide glasses can foster these studies since they allow one to easily tune the microscopic structure via a change either of composition or temperature. We propose to perform an x-ray photon correlation study of these glasses to evaluate the beam-induced relaxations. We aim at unveiling the influence of the amorphous structure on the dynamic modifications induced by x-rays.

Spatial ordering phenomena contribute significantly to the systems free energy and thus to the overall stability of an ordered phase in correlated systems. This proposal aims at developing a new method to gain access to spatiotemporal correlation phenomena in solids. Our approach is based on analyzing the speckle patter on an area detector after diffraction of a coherent x-ray beam from ferroelectric domains. ","1488":"We propose to investigate the tuning of magnetic fluctuations in epitaxial thin films of Sr2IrO4 by combining XRS and XPCS at ID10. The pure magnetic scattering Bragg peaks in Sr2IrO2 have a huge intensity when the incident energy is tuned to the Ir L3 edge E=11.218keV. The new EBS open up the new possibility to investigate this magnetic signal using coherent X-ray methods such as XPCS. Our previous XRS experiments using modest flux on an ESRF bending magnetic, suggest a tuning of the magnetic correlation length possibly from the modification of magnetic correlation time-scale. The aim of this proposal is to reveal the tuning of the magnetic fluctuations directly using XPCS methods at the EBS.  This would represent the first direct observation of dynamically driven quasi-order from disorder state in the scientifically topical strongly correlated materials and would be a highlight in the new science challenges offered by the EBS. The proposal feasibility has been discussed with ID10.","1489":"Structural relaxation is one of the most fundamental issues in glasses yet to be fully understood. Recently, many interesting results regarding glass structural relaxation have been obtained by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements on metallic glasses (MGs). As an emerging novel class of MGs, high entropy metallic glasses (HEMGs) have been developed by compositional design with five or more elements of equimolar or near-equimolar ratios. They are named after their core feature of high configurational entropy. HEMGs provide a valuable opportunity to study the configurational entropy and associated local structural effect on structural relaxation in glasses. Here, we propose to study the correlation between high-entropy effect and structure relaxation in HEMGs in comparison with conventional MGs by XPCS (this proposal) at ID10 and high-energy diffraction (another proposal) to deepen our understanding of the high-entropy effect and its impact on glass relaxation.","1490":"GeO2 is a very important material for earth scientists as a chemical and structural analogue of SiO2, a major component of earth\u2019s interior. Almost nothing is known about the crystallization, melting curve, metallization mechanism and the structure of the liquid phase under dynamic compression at a microscopic level. We propose here to investigate local structure of glassy GeO2 compressed by laser shock up to the Warm Dense Matter state by in-situ time resolved X-ray Absorption (XAS).","1491":"U3Cu4Ge4 is a ferromagnet with the magnetic moments aligned along the [100] axis of the orthorhombic\r\ncrystal structure. When magnetic field is applied along the hard [010] direction, U3Cu4Ge4 displays a firstorder\r\nphase transition in the magnetization at H* = 25 T. This phase transition occurs due to the existence\r\nof two inequivalent minima in the magnetic-anisotropy energy of the material and reflects a strong\r\nresponse of the 5f electrons. Our magnetization and ultrasound data strongly suggest a Fermi-surface\r\nreconstruction and lattice deformation at H*. Here, we propose to perform orbital-selective magnetometry\r\nthrough x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the U L3 edge to determine the microscopic nature of the\r\nfield-induced transition.

The magnetism of the double perovskite Nd2ZnIrO6 combines the disparate characters of 4f and 5d electrons, making it a model system to study local-itinerant duality. We have synthesized single crystals of this material and discovered an unusual magnetic behavior. Both 4f and 5d sublattices order at 16.5 K. In an applied field, the material undergoes a series of pronounced metamagnetic transitions, at 3.5 or 5.0 T (depending on the field direction), at around 20 T, and 50 T. The compound lends itself particularly well to ion-specific studies of magnetism, which we have already used in a resonant x-ray scattering study of the 3.5\/5.0 T transition. Here, we propose to use the unique microcoil XMCD setup at ID24 to efficiently characterize the evolution of the Nd and Ir magnetic states up to 30T.","1493":"Iron(II)oxalate dihydrate has emerged as an important building block for the preparation of new, functional advanced materials. Despite the extensive investigation carried out over the years, almost nothing is known about its physico-chemical properties at extreme conditions. Preliminary results have shown that FeC2O4 \u00d7 2 H2O exhibits several structural transitions upon pressure increase. The simple chemical composition, the high oxygen fugacity of the system and the capability of Fe to exist in multiple valence states, are desirable conditions to attempt on the synthesis of new exotic C, O and H bearing materials at extreme conditions. The aim of this study is the investigation of structural evolution (electronic and atomic) of FeC2O4 \u00d7 2 H2O at extreme pressures and its stability at extreme pressures and temperatures.

By combining BCDI with the dependence of resonant magnetic scattering on the polarization of the incident X-rays, we aim to reconstruct the AF domain structure through the bulk of the sample for the first time. By performing these measurements as a function of temperature through the phase transition, we hope to clarify the role played by magnetostriction in the metal-insulator transition, providing valuable insight into the nature of the phase transition currently under debate.","1500":"We propose a scanning resonant x-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) study to characterize mesoscale phase-separation phenomena in Eu5In2Sb6. Our interest in this structural family is due to its two perpendicular glide symmetries. On the one hand, this non-symmorphicity may give rise to topological crystalline insulating states including wallpaper fermions or the elusive axion-insulator. On the other hand, we recently discovered that these symmetries enforce complex noncollinear magnetic order that separates into compensated antiferromagnetic and weakly Ising-ferrimagnetic regimes. Neutron and muon studies and (conventional) resonant x-ray scattering have provided us with strong evidence that this mesoscale magnetism must occur on a length scale between 90nm and 15um. The real-space observation using nanofocus-SXDM will open up a range of follow-up studies, with the ultimate goal to magnetically manipulate arrangements of topologically distinct insulating domains.","1501":"We propose to image the domains of cubic Barium Titanate (BTO) nanoparticles in the presence of electric fields up to several MV\/m, using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI). We will construct thin-layer capacitors, assembled onto lithographic electrode arrays. The cubic phase of BTO above TC = 373K is paraelectric and would not respond to the applied electric field. Below TC, BTO becomes tetragonal and ferroelectric, so can be polarized and store energy. However, when synthesized under hydrothermal conditions, BTO nanoparticles are found to be cubic at room temperature. These particles are found to have a several-fold enhanced dielectric constant, exceeding 6000. Our model is that nano-BTO is cubic on average because of strain, while its 50nm-sized domains are locally tetragonal. We expect to see changes of the domain structure when the capacitor voltage is changed. This will be visible directly in the diffraction patterns, and later revealed by BCDI phase retrieval.","1502":"This experiment  will follow \"in-situ\" the phase transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic of CoO.  We will observe the evolution of two non collinear reflections of choice from room temperature, where CoO shows rock salt structure, to a target temperature below Tn (293 K). The temperature will be controlled through external cooling using a LN2 cryostat. The study will be performed through reciprocal space maping and raster scanning and full field imaging of the CoO in ID01.Through the evaluation of the results from high resolution reciprocal space mapping and texture and strain mapping, in combination with group theory we expect to draw a clearer picture identifying the symmetry of the observed domain walls and consequently the indexing of the twinned domains.","1503":"The aim of this proposal is to locally map the interstitial oxygen concentration, using diffuse scattering, of individual grains and grain boundaries of niobium.

However, the very nature of the EPS state has frustrated any attempts over the past 3 decades to accurately characterise the microscopic structures of its constituents. We propose a diffraction resolved tomography experiment with nano-focused beam on ID11 to tackle this long-standing problem. The results will allow for accurate microscopic structural models of the competing states to be ascertained for the first time and will also provide a 3-dimensional map of strain fields within the electronically separated phases on a 0.1-100 \u03bcm length scale.

However, our previous HR-XRD measurements (HC_4779) showed that naphthazarin, part of the PHNQ family do not induce such lattice distortion when occluded into calcite via ACC precipitation and crystallization in water (dissolution\/reprecipitation mechanisms). To complete our understanding of the mechanism of naphthazarin occlusion we here measure calcite-naphthazarin samples obtained after ACC crystallization induced by heating (solid-state transformation).","1509":"The main goal of this proposal is to investigate the crystal structure evolution around the Curie temperature (TC) and magnetocaloric effect (MCE) at low temperatures in RSrCoFeO6 (R = Nd, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) double perovskites using the state-of-art high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffractometer available at the beamline ID22, ESRF.

On the other hand, we discovered that it induces a phase separation between complex noncollinear magnetic regimes on a lengthscale of 90nm ~ 15um. One likely mechanism would be underlying structural inhomogeneities. Magnetoelastic coupling should allow us to distinguish the lattices of the two magnetic regimes. A multi-phase refinement could then reveal variations of the atomic positions and\/or occupancies.

Recently, using a prototype based on CaMn3Mn4O12, we have revealed a new kind of orbital order at this critical doping level consisting of stripes of orbital ordered and charge disorder, providing the missing intermediate state between CE-type insulating, and FM metallic, phases. On the other hand, a completely distinct multiferroic ground state arising from charge-transfer and G-type orbital order, is found in HgMn3Mn4O12. It is surprising that substitution of Ca cations with isovalent Hg gives rise to such dramatic changes in physical properties.

Preliminary analysis points towards a possible, not reported earlier, spin crossover transition (SCO) of Co(II) between a high-spin S = 3\/2 and a low-spin S = \u00bd states. A structural study with neutron powder diffraction did not reveal any decrease of the unit cell usually associated with the SCO effect. However, our low temperature IR spectroscopy and XAFS Co K study suggest weak distortion of the average crystal structure.

Our approach is to confront experimental data with FDMNES simulations, to reveal the local electronic structure and magnetic properties of each magnetic ions above and below an expected structural distortion, which could be at the origin of an ordered occupancy of the Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions, possibly responsible for the ferroelectricity recently observed at low temperature.

Eu compounds are less studied than Yb compounds, due to the very complex synthesis method (both RE have a high vapor pressure, but Eu is more sensitive to oxygen and moisture).

Since the proposed method is new, we would like to first test its accuracy. We will use Nd2Fe14B and SmFe11Ti polycrystalline samples with different grain sizes to compare XMCD-obtained anisotropy with known anisotropy constants detected on single crystals of these compounds.

We propose therefore to study this phenomenon with RIXS in YBCO single crystals and thin films, so to make the bridge with neutron results. The doping, temperature and magnetic field evolution will tell us how strict correspondence is between the peaks measured by the two techniques. Ultimately, the experiment will enable the study of intra-unit-cell magnetism in thin films, a domain which is inaccessible to neutron experiments, where strain and sample confinement can provide decisive information about the importance of this phenomenon in the physics of cuprate HTS.

These short-ranged modulations survive down to extremely low doping, where magnetism rules the phase diagram. This evidence might suggest a possible role spin excitations have in the formation of these modulations. To this aim, we will investigate with RIXS YBCO at different doping levels with full polarization control of the incident and scattered beams at the CDF wavevector. The goal is to check in the CDF peak the presence, if any, of a spin-flip component due to magnetic excitations. We will therefore figure out if CDF are only made of charge, as commonly believed, or if they are characterized by a mixed spin-charge character. Ultimately, we can identify which is the driving force behind the unconventional phenomenology of the strange metal, a needed prerequisite to properly model this mysterious phase of the matter.","1524":"Combining high resolution RIXS and IXS we have recently unveiled bulk charge modulation in the HTS cuprates oxychloride, close to the 1\/8 doping, where they are most intense, and their interaction with the Cu-O Bond stretching phonon via an intrinsic excitation of the charge modulations, which induce a shift of the phonon softening minimum away from the position of charge modulation propagation vector. To understand the nature of the charge modulation, and their interaction with the phonons, we need to explore how doping modify both the propagation vector and the phonon softening minima. Moreover, we observed that the phonon softening survive in temperature the charge modulation, suggesting its fluctuations are very robust, but we lack a detailed study of the temperature dependence for the phonon softening. We propose to answer these question, and reveal the nature of the charge modulation in cuprate oxychlorides, and their interaction with the Cu-O Bond stretching mode.","1525":"We have recently discovered novel multi-magnon excitations in single crystals of Fe2O3 using 2p3d resonant inelastic x-ray scattering.  These excitations correspond to triple-, quadruple- and quintuple-magnons that propagate these higher multiples of spin angular momentum beyond the conventional single- and double-magnons. The higher-rank magnetic quasiparticles have never been observed (or studied before) making 2p3d RIXS a unique method to investigate these original states. Our goal is to study the dimensionality effect on the novel higher-rank magnetic excitations by studying LaFeO3 grown on SrTiO3 in the limit of 1-, 3- and 25-unit cells.","1526":"The Fermi surface of cuprate superconductors consists of a single large pocket for overdoped compositions and four small pockets for underdoped compositions. It has been proposed that the reconstruction occurs in YBa2Cu3Oy for dopings less than the critical doping where the pseudogap appears, p<p* and that the pseudogap is responsible.  Recent id32 experiments on the overdoped clean superconductor Tl2Ba2CuO6+\u03b4 (Tl2201) suggest an alternate explanation. In Tl2201, the Fermi surface (FS) reconstruction is due to CDW order present below a certain doping p<p_CDW where there is no pseudogap. Here we propose to search for evidence of CDW order in overdoped Y1-yCayBa2Cu3O6+x at dopings the near the critical doping p* of the pseudogap. If such order were observed, it would suggest that the CDW is also the primary cause of the FS reconstruction in YBCO and have general implications for understanding the electron structure of the cuprates.

A better theoretical understanding of these systems requires experimental input on the\r\nmagnetic exchange interactions and the symmetry and degree of localization\/itinerancy of the involved 3d and 4f states. Here we propose a RIXS study of the\r\nspin dynamics and charge excitations on the Mn and Nd sublattices in NdMn2Ge2 to directly probe their evolution across the phase diagram.","1528":"BaNi2As2 is a structural, but non-magnetic, homologue of the parent compound of the Fe-based superconductors BaFe2As2. An incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) and commensurate CDW (C-CDW) are observed next to an orthorhombic and triclinic structural transition, respectively. Even though the formation of the I-CDW is related to a complete softening of an optical phonon branch it is seen to be of unconventional nature. Elastoresitance measurements reveal an electronic nematic phase suggesting this system to be candidate system for charge-driven electronic nematicity. Recent near edge x-ray absorption fine structure measurements show a connection of the CDWs with orbital ordering, suggesting that nematicity could rise from orbital fluctuations. We propose to carry out polarization dependent resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of the CDWs reflections at the Ni L3 edge (~852.8 eV) to investigate the orbital structure of the CDWs.\r\n","1529":"Thanks to the progress in 2D materials technology, van der Waals (vdW) materials with outstanding magnetic properties can be synthesised nowadays by epitaxial methods down to the mono\/few layers.  However, substrate choice might lead to unwanted issues compromising the achievement of the desired properties. On the other hand, substrate engineering represents an ideal playground for understanding low-dimensional magnetism. Our preliminary XAS\/XMCD studies on the epitaxial Chromium diiodide, CrI2, monolayers (ML) grown by MBE on a metallic (gold) and an insulating (mica) substrate suggest respectively paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states at 4K, sometimes in contrast with early theoretical results. These dissimilar behaviours might be explained in terms of charge doping from the metallic substrate and\/or lattice distortion affecting Cr local symmetry and the material ground state.","1530":"Dynamic fluctuations from periodic charge order correlations pervade the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, perhaps more so than superconductivity. Recent advances in the energy resolution of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) instruments operating in soft x-ray regime enabled the detection of these fluctuations over energy and momentum. We recently performed two Cu-L3 RIXS studies on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi2212) [2-3] and discovered dynamic fluctuations peaking at |q|=qCO along ALL in-plane directions in double layer Bi2212 \u2013 a ring-like pattern with finite energy-loss and radius equal to charge order wave vector magnitude. These correlations connect to the static charge order in the cuprates given the |q|=qCO relation. However, the charge-like nature of these dynamic correlations has not yet been experimentally determined. We propose using polarimetric RIXS to identify whether the high-energy quasi-circular dynamic correlations in Bi2212 are charge or spin in nature.","1532":"The topological crystalline insulators (TCI) are materials with a topologically nontrivial band structure protected by a crystalline symmetry. One of the TCI materials is Pb1-xSnxTe which undergo transition from normal to inverted band gap structure with composition changing. The optical and magnetooptical measurements show ferroelectric transition at temperature of about 30-100K for Sn concentration of 30-60%. On the other hand, the temperatue dependent x-ray diffraction does not show structural change. Our goal is to study (Pb,Sn)Te thin films by EXAFS to check local atomic displacements below transition temperature. The results will explain the nature of the observed phase transition. The results will be comparted with (Pb,Ge)Te alloy layers, which are known to be ferroelectric.","1533":"The overarching aim of this project is to re-examine the general issue of breaking of inversion symmetry at extreme pressures. We focus here on the model ferroelectric perovskite PbTiO3. The approach is to use X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the local environment of the Pb and Ti cations and look for direct proofs of off-centring at high pressures. Measurements will be carried out up to 100 GPa, at room temperature and at 15 K for a more relevant comparison with first-principle calculations. Together with our recent infrared spectroscopy data, this is expected to provide new insight on the reality of ferroelectricty under pressure. ","1534":"Information on the structural stability of cubic ABO3 perovskite still lacks systematic detailing. BaZrO3 is a key material for several applications in broad fields due to its unusual properties; however, its structural stability under pressure still raises great doubts. This topic is considered a challenge, especially when related to the possible phase transition also at low temperature. The lack of detailed structural data along with the small amount of previous studies on the phase transitions of BaZrO3 makes this topic an interesting to be explored. Therefore, we propose here to study the phase transition under pressure Pm-3m to I4\/mcm in BaZrO3 perovskite and to probe its pressure-temperature phase diagram, considering runs at low temperature (10-300K) and high-pressure (0-1.2 Mbar). This will provide information on crystal structure stability of BaZrO3 perovskite.","1535":"The langasite family of compounds draws considerable attention because of their functional properties and recently have attracted a great interest as a new type of multiferroics. Recent high-pressure (HP)-low-temperature (LT) experiments using synchrotron Moessbauer source revealed the series of the magnetic and electronic transitions of Fe-bearing langasites. While the magnetic transitions were proposed to be induced by redistribution of Fe across the cationic sites, limitations of PXRD did not allow to support this hypothesis. Moreover, PXRD experiments were performed only at ambient temperature. Here we propose to further elaborate on the nature of magnetic and electronic transitions in langasites and to perform in situ HP-LT single crystal XRD studies that allow to track the subtle atomic-scale changes in their structures.","1536":"The antiferromagnetic square-lattice spin-orbital Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 has been intensely studied, primarily due to its numerous common features with the high Tc superconducting cuprates. Although the overall energy scale of the magnetic ground state of this system is well described by isotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions, in-plane magnetic anisotropy is known to exist, which leads to a magnon gap. Our recent Raman measurements of the magnon gap under uniaxial stress provided strong evidence that the in-plane magnetic anisotropy is associated with pseudospin-lattice interactions that break the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal lattice implying an intrinsic orthorhombicity of the system. Here, we propose to perform high resolution x-ray diffraction on high-quality Sr2IrO4 single crystals to uncover such hitherto unobserved orthorhombic distortions.","1537":"CH4\u2013N2 mixtures have been predicted to react to yield high-energy-density materials under pressure that could be quenched to ambient. Such reactions could also hold importance in our understanding of the structural evolution of planetary satellites, such as Titan. Our preliminary studies indicate CH4-N2 van der Waals compound formation at pressures as low as 5 GPa, whilst upon further compression above 100 GPa covalent bonded compounds emerge. Here we propose to initially determine the structure and equation of state of the van der Waals compounds. We will then explore both the high-pressure and high-pressure high-temperature synthesis pathways of the undetermined C-N-H compounds, determine their structures, and the possibility of recovering the materials to ambient conditions. \r\n","1538":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the electronic order in the newly discovered Z 2 kagome metal CsV3Sb5 as a function of pressure and temperature. CsV3Sb5 has become a highly topical material due to its unconventional superconducting phase. Given its complex electronic structure, it is thought that this state may host exotic quasiparticles like Majorana bound states. Interestingly, it has now been discovered that superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 is intimately related to competing charge density wave (CDW) instabilities, and, crucially, these electronic  uperstructures appear to be highly tuneable by hydrostatic pressure. However, so far, a detailed pressure-dependent crystallographic study and a characterization of the CDW order, its symmetry and mechanism has not been achieved. Here, we propose a high-pressure single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD) study to fill this gap and to shed light on the interaction between electronic order\r\nand superconductivity in Z2 kagome metals.","1539":"The RPt2Si2 (with R = La, Pr) single crystals have a complex low-temperature phase diagram. LaPt2Si2 shows at ambient pressure 2 charge density waves phases (200K and 110K) and a tetragonal orthorhombic distortion. A sharp first order anomaly is observed by resistivity measurements at T*~85K often associated to the CDW. Below 1.8K, LaPt2Si2 is a superconductor. Under pressure, resistivity measurements show a disappearance of the first order anomaly at a critical pressure of 2.5GPa. Similarly, PrPt2Si2, show 2 transitions by resistivity measurements, with one of them associated to charge density waves phase. The aim of this proposal is to establish the (P,T) phase diagram and the evolution of the modulation vectors under hydrostatic pressure (up to 10GPa and down to 10K).","1540":"We suppose that accurate temperature dependent X-ray powder diffraction measurements in order to study unusual effect of crystal structure transformation of mono- LaCoO3 and multi-valent metastable La0.5Ba0.5CoO2.87 modified by pulsed magnetic field 20 Tesla. We expect to obtain reliable experimental data on the crystal structure, isotropic ADP for Co and O, as well as lattice parameters under applied pressure. Obtained X-ray diffraction results will be combined with pressure-dependent XMCD and neutron diffraction data as well as temperature-dependent XRD results at ID-22 and neutron diffraction (HRPT, PSI) in order to give us the opportunity to establish the correlations between crystal and magnetic structure changes and clarify the origin of magneto-structural phase transition near the PM\u2192FM\u2192AFM transitions, as well as to provide an input for a novel modeling methods based on the density functional theory (DFT, DFT+U, DFT+U+SO) and the dynamic mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT).","1541":"Ruthenium (Ru) is a 4d transition metal which is a member of the group 8 of the periodic table. It exhibits only a single electron in its highest occupied atomic orbital, making it unique amongst the group 8 elements. Surprisingly, little is known about the behaviour of Ru under HP-HT conditions despite the considerable attention which the transition metals attract in general. Here we propose to perform a detailed characterisation of the Ru phase diagram up to 100 GPa and 6000 K. The melting curve of Ru will be characterised experimentally for the first time, and the validity of the predicted hcp \u2192 fcc transition will be tested. If confirmed, the transition would constitute the first structural phase transition observed in Ru.","1542":"A liquid-liquid transition (LLT) is a first-order transition separating two liquid phases of the same single-component substance with different densities. Despite the long-standing and wide interest in this phenomenon, it remains poorly understood and unambiguous experimental realizations are scarce. The present proposers reported in 2020 the experimental discovery of a LLT in compressed liquid sulphur in the range 0-2.15 GPa, 450-1040 K [1]. Moreover, we conveyed evidence for a critical point ending the LLT line, long-sought in the case of water and never observed in any other system so far. The present proposal aims at better understanding the driving mechanisms and order parameter of the LLT in sulfur by measuring the shear viscosities of the low-density and high-density liquids from 0.2 to 2.5 GPa, using the falling sphere technique in the Paris-Edinburg press.","1543":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate the stability, structures, phase boundary lines and  thermomechanical properties of intriguing He-H2O compounds at extreme P and T (P = 0\u2013120 GPa, T = 300\u20132500 K) predicted by first-principle calculations.  The observation of such compounds could drastically impact the current models of giant icy planets. We plan to load He-H2-O2 ternary mixtures in the DAC and induce the formation of H2O in He at a given pressure. Doing so will provide a controlled way to reveal stable He-bearing-ice compounds. These compounds are expected to exhibit exotic behaviours such as a highly diffusive, \u2018superionic\u2019 character at high T involving both helium atoms and protons.  In previous runs (HC-2185, HC-3952, HC-4677), we have investigated the properties and stability fields of superionic phases in pure H2O ice by XRD on laser-heated samples in the diamond anvil cell (DAC). A similar approach will be operated here. ","1544":"Measuring and understanding the internal strain changes in response to the external pressure produces critical information to unveil the origin of unconventional behavior of crystalline materials in high-pressure environments. Moreover, defects in nano-crystals have a critical influence on the properties of nanocrystals where a single defect can completely modify the properties. Because of the close proximity of surfaces the energy and mobility of defects in nano-objects are borne to be very different from what they are in the bulk. The primary goal is the understanding of the defect behavior (creation, stability, annihilation, defect-defect interaction) including the strain fields surrounding them in nano-objects under high-pressure. We propose to perform in-situ experiments combining High-pressure and Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging, which has become the most effective technique for imaging the 3D structure of individual crystals.","1545":"As an archetypal diatomic molecule, the high-pressure allotropes of molecular nitrogen are an excellent testbed for refining solid-state physics models. Above 110 GPa, the physicochemical properties of nitrogen radically change as it transforms into a 3D polymeric single-bonded solid. While ab-initio calculations predict a straightforward phase diagram for the polymeric phases\u2014with only three polymeric solids up to 2100 GPa\u2014recent experimental investigations suggest a much greater complexity. As it stands, four polymeric nitrogen phases have been synthesized below 245 GPa, with only one matching theoretical predictions. We here aim to uncover nitrogen's phase diagram between 220 and 400 GPa, discover new polymeric phases, solve their structure with single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and determine their stability range. These experiments will challenge current theoretical models, providing a rare example of the behavior of simple homoatomic systems at ultrahigh pressures.","1546":"The diamond anvil  Raman phonon frequency shift at the interface with the sample is now currently used as a pressure measurement for laboratory experiments above 100 GPa up to 500 GPa at least. However, the calibration of this spectroscopic pressure measurement is questioned. The aim of this proposal is twofold:  1)  Calibrate the Raman diamond pressure gauge up to above 500 GPa by using the XRD and the EoS of  two pressure standards, gold and Rhenium. Data have been collected up to 420 GPa so far.  2)  Validate the pressure scale using the volume of diamond under hydrostatic pressure up to above 500 GPa. Data have been collected up to 200 GPa so far. The Raman shift of diamond under hydrostatic pressure will be also measured, so to provide  the diamond Gruneisen parameter . Toroidal-DACs will be used to reach the 500 GPa range.","1547":"We propose to explore how the atomic lattice and, consequently, the electronic structure evolve when the thickness of layered van der Waals (vdW) materials reduces from several hundreds of layers down to just a few layers. Interestingly, the macroscopic physical properties for many of these layered materials change as the number of layers becomes small. It is clear that these effects need to be understood in order to effectively exploit them in novel technological applications. To this end, we want to use cutting-edge x-ray diffraction (XRD) to monitor the structural changes as a function of thickness in nano-flakes of the prominent vdW material 1T-IrTe2, in which electronic order and superconductivity exist and potentially interact in a non-trivial manner. Knowledge of the precise atomic structure, which is hitherto widely unknown, will enable us to develop realistic theoretical models that effectively describe the electronic structure on the verge of the 2D-limit.","1548":"Many metallic glasses (MGs) have been reported to undergo a liquid-liquid transition (LLT) on heating in the supercooled liquid regime, which is characterized\r\nby an exothermic peak in the calorimetric signal and a structural change within the short- to medium-range order.But the study of LLT in MGs under a combined\r\ncondition of temperature and pressure is still missing, which is important for our understanding of the LLT mechanism in multi-component liquid systems. For\r\nthis issue, we propose here to follow the structural evolutions during the LLT in Pd42.5Ni42.5P15 MGs by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) under different\r\ntemperature and pressure conditions. This will provide us the fundamental information of LLT under high-pressures and help us to construct the pressure temperature phase diagram for two different metallic liquids.","1549":"We will study scandium (Sc) metal up to 200 GPa, resolving long-standing discrepancies in the literature regarding the structure(s) of the incommensurate host-guest Sc-II phase. These investigations are carried out in the context of novel machine-learned material models which have recently predicted that the guest-structure of Sc-II undergoes a transition from face-centred to body-centred tetragonal at 50-70 GPa. We will test this prediction, aiming to either validate this promising new computation technique or provide data which will inform future developments of this approach. In addition, we will attempt to collect high-quality diffraction data to aid in solving the as-yet unknown Sc-III and Sc-IV phases. ","1550":"We will measure nano beam single crystal XRD under extremely condition on (HA)2(FA)Pb2I7, which exhibits an edge state at ambient condition and a CDW and long-range order structure with pressure. This experiment will clarify below questions: 1) the origin of edge state at ambient condition, allowing a conclusion on the existence of the edge when the characteristic photoluminescence (PL) is suppressed at high pressure. This is important for the photovoltaic (PV) device design and applications. 2) detect the  -vector of the CDW and long-range order phase originating from pressure. The results will give a complete explanation for our previous results.","1551":"Shock-loaded dynamic collapse of pores in solids has been a problem of interest because of its relevance to a variety of applications. Our previous experiment at the ESRF revealed the motion of the pore boundary in stunning detail, but was unable to track the kinematics in the material around the pore. In this work we propose to measure real-time evolution of strain field around shock-loaded collapsing holes on the mid-plane of the specimen with X-ray digital image correlation (XDIC). It involves introducing a micro speckle pattern on the specimen mid-plane around a through-hole and imaging its evolution during shock loading. The strain field is extracted through digital image correlation (DIC) of the micro speckle pattern. These experiments build on preliminary data we have collected at Advanced Photon Source (ID 35) recently. We plan to conduct experiments over a wide range of impact velocities that span the strength dominated regime to the hydrodynamic regime.","1552":"This proposal aims to study the conversion of amorphous precursors to crystalline phases that occurs during the precipitation of rare earth minerals. Previously, we evidenced the formation of transient liquid and amorphous solid phases during the crystallization of cerium oxalate (CeOx) using far-field ptychographic X-ray computed tomography. However, these analyses have failed to give us information about the exact location and mechanism of the liquid- and\/or amorphous-to-crystalline phase transformation. Here, we wish to exploit the ability of near-field ptychography at ID16A to scan larger samples and investigate later reaction stages where large crystals are formed. Combined with our previous work on the kinetics of the transient phases, this information will enable us to develop a new theory of non-classical crystallization so that we can better model and predict precipitation processes crucial to rare earth metal recycling in the nuclear, battery, and electronics industries.","1553":"This experiment aims at understanding the phase transformation routes involved in the non-classical crystallization of calcareous biominerals leading to the production of large single crystals from amorphous precursors. Two possible mechanisms are proposed, i.e., solid-solid vs dissolution-reprecipitation. We demonstrated with an in vitro model, that a solid-solid transition produces crystalline properties similar to the ones observed in our biogenic model. We now hypothesize that a solid-solid transition is at play in most of calcareous biomineralization. With this proposal, we want to assess the generality of this result, by producing 3D crystalline property maps of a series of biominerals, chosen among different phyla. This proposal exploits the unique features of 3D Bragg ptychography to produce detailed maps of crystalline coherence domains, combined with the drastically improved brilliance of the ESRF-EBS, allowing us to investigate a significant number of large sample volumes.

The doped Fe (Mn) ion is supposed to be coupled with a neighbor O vacancy. To confirm such a Fe (Mn)-VO complex, we will measure Fe (Mn) X-ray fluorescence holograms and obtain a detailed picture of the local structures around Fe (Mn) by the reconstruction of 3D atomic images. The setup for this experiment is well established, and we have enough experiences of the experiment at D2AM in ESRF.","1555":"The flexoelastic response of bent GaAs nanowires is planned to identify experimentally by measuring the change of the bending radius of single bent nanowires\r\n by a pump and probe experiment at beamline ID09 equipped with a fs laser. After the excitation of electrons the redistribution of charge carriers in the conduction\r\n band from the compressed to the expanded regions of the bent lattice will screen the radial electric field and will modify the radial strain gradient visible by a\r\n change of bending radius.","1556":"We propose here to perform dynamic compression experiments on Sn probed by time-resolved XRD at the ESRF, exploiting the extraordinary capabilities of the beamline ID09, to observe how kinetics effects at high strain rates will influence its solid \u03b2 - solid \u03b3 and liquid-solid structural transitions. Dynamic compression of the sample will be performed using our improved dynamic diamond anvil cell that allows now compression and decompression ramps spanning 3 orders of magnitude in time between 200 \u03bcs to 100 ms. The temperature of the compression can be also be increased up to ~1000K.","1557":"We aim to improve our understanding of the connection between the network rigidity and the metamict transformation induced in glasses by intense X-ray beams by studying this structural and dynamical transition in three canonical glasses: SiO2, GeO2 and P2O5. We want to address two issues: \r\ni) the quantitative relationship between the absorbed dose and the network rigidity; \r\nii) the energy dependence of the radiolitic process at the basis of the X-rays induced defect creation mechanism.","1558":"Hard X-rays can trigger reversible atomic rearrangements in network glasses. There is a growing amount of literature investigating this effect and it has been observed to depend on the dose-rate and the local structure of the glass. However, most of the measurements have been performed at very similar photon energies and an influence of the wavelength would radically challenge our understandings of this phenomenon. We plan to extend the characterization of this effect also at higher photon energies to either prove or disprove our current understanding.","1559":"In a recent experiment, we demonstrated that the glass and super-cooled liquid dynamics could be experimentally resolved while heating at a constant rate, thus extending the limitation of temperature due to crystallization and enabling the direct comparison with mechanical and calorimetric characterization. In this proposal, a set of alloys is selected comprising high-entropy and \u2018conventional\u2019 metallic glasses of three different compositional families: La20Ce20Y20Ni20Al20, Pd20Pt20Cu20Ni20P20 and Ti16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7Cu16.7Ni16.7Be16.7. The new temperature and time windows accessible by XPCS at ESRF-EBS will allow us to study, for the first time, the high-entropy effect on the microscopic dynamics of glass-forming melts. This will be a crucial experiment to check if there is an actual high entropy effect on the viscosity behavior of metallic melts.","1560":"FCC NPs have become important for physics, medicine, chemistry, etc. However, their bulk properties have always been neglected and poorly explored. Vacancies-induced twinning is a new concept that describes the appearance of irregular NPs morphologies and  HCP Au phase.\r\nOur preliminary synchrotron experiments at DESY showed that the X-ray beam causes the structural evolution of Au NPs. Analyzing SAXS+WAXS patterns, one can detect \"fingerprints\" of vacancies in NPs. The presence of \"fingerprints\" is predicted by our computational simulations and is the key element in the proof of vacancy-induced twinning.\r\nIn addition, the current project will improve understanding of the X-ray photons-matter interactions,  which heavily affect system structure, chemical reactions, and kinetics. These effects are underestimated and suffer from a lack of systematic research. Systematic studies of Au NPs evolution triggered by the EBS X-ray beam will allow a better understanding of beam-induced effects.","1561":"Magnetic vortices appear even in ferromagnetic films thin enough to behave as 2D samples. In such cases, a winding pattern of in-plane magnetization surrounds a perpendicular core, whose extent is typically a few nanometers. If the film thickness increases, transmission measurements seem to indicate that the core diameter always remain below ca. 100 nm; on the other hand, simulations hint at a more complex, 3D structure reminiscent of a barrel.\r\nWe propose to image vortex cores (VCs) using magnetic coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) on micron-sized CoGd beads. In these systems, we have confirmed the presence of vortices with Magnetic Force Microscopy as well as XMCD-PEEM, with VCs over 200 nm in diameter from MFM. Thus, for the first time in 3D magnetic imaging, the resolution would be sufficient to reveal the full structure of such a 3D vortex configuration. Moreover, prior sample demagnetization should promote the presence of micromagnetic singularities (Bloch points) in the cores.","1562":"This experiment aims at investigating the insulator-to-metal transition in the noble gas Krypton. Total energy calculations predict that this transition in Krypton should occur around 310 GPa. Such high pressures are not easily achievable using static compression techniques. We aim to perform laser induced shock compression on pre-compressed Krypton, and use velocity interferometry (VISAR) to detect the insulator-to-metal transition. The insulator-to-metal transition in rare-gas solids is predicted to occur in the vicinity of the hcp phase interval. This experiment will serve as the base for our future x-ray experiments where structural phase transitions will be probed alongside the insulator-to-metal transition. ","1563":"In the proposed experiment we will investigate the structural aspects of dynamic deformation of Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses under laser shock loading. To this\r\nend, a mid- power density laser with a nanoseconds pulse duration will be used to generate a shock wave and the local atomic arrangement of the glassy sample will be probed during its propagation by time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy for Cu K-edge. By quantitative analysis of the EXAFS spectra we\r\nwill evaluate the parameters of local atomic environment of Cu atoms during shock compression. These results will help us to elucidate the structural origin of the experimentally observed anomalies in the pressure dependence of the sound\/shock wave velocity in Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses and identify a possible underlying pressure-induced structural transition in the amorphous phase.","1564":"The conditions and mechanisms reported for the pressure-induced alpha-omega phase transformation in zirconium are different under static and dynamic\r\n loading. In a previous work (HC-1607), we have studied this phase transition using a dynamic hydrostatic compression setup involving a dynamic Diamond Anvils  Cell (DAC) coupled with ms-scale time-resolved X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). The dynamic transition pressure measured at 12\u00b11 GPa was similar to  that observed under static hydrostatic compression, but the transition time was found to be less than 2 ms, in contradiction with earlier results which reported a  sluggish kinetics, with transformation times reaching several minutes. In this work, we would like to address the same problem at the ns time scale, using laser  shock compression coupled with ps time-resolved XAS measurements.","1565":"We propose an experiment involving valence band RIXS at ID26 to search for discrete excitations out of the 7F0 singlet ground state of Am3+. Americium is known to have localised 5f electrons, and the M4 absorption peak is small, as the j = 5\/2 state is almost full, so that elastic transitions into this state are strongly suppressed. Calculations (below) show that the elastic signal is small, but there is a strong inelastic transition at 1.8 eV. This should be observable on ID26. Such an observation will resolve a present challenge in RIXS experiments on actinide (5f) systems.","1566":"The proposed experiment focuses on exploring the electronic configurations and magnetic properties of unquenchable novel iron oxides (here after UNI oxides) (e.g. Fe5O7, Fe6.32O9, Fe7O10), using the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source spectroscopy and Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction up to 130 GPa and 2500 K.

The quasicrystals were found in a meteorite formed in the earliest moments of the solar system which means these processes were active 4.5 billion years ago. Using the ID28 side station beam line we propose to fully characterise the structural quality of this natural quasicrystal. In particular we will quantify the eventual amount of phason strain and phason fluctuations by precise measurement of Bragg peak position and width, and the presence of eventual diffuse scattering. The results will be compared to measurements on a single grain quasicrystal grown with the same composition in the laboratory.

It is intended that these measurements will be of the type 'one last datapoint', syntheses, or tests of unusual assembly configurations that have either followed a previous proposal, or will have a follow-up publication or submission.\r\nDue to the time constraints, they will be limited in terms of safety considerations and allocated to periods of similar experimental setups.","1570":"Artificial multiferroic heterostructures are of high interest in many fields especially for their expected high industrial impact. We undertook a long-term project aiming at determining the coupling phenomena between the strain state, magnetic properties and ferroelectric properties in multiferroic composites made of embedded MFe2O4 ferrites (MFO, M = Co, Ni, Mn and Fe) in prototypical epitaxial BaTiO3 (001) (BTO) layers. Recrystallization by air annealing of the micron sized platelets is required to obtain long range magnetic and ferroelectric orderings which does not lead to intermixing because spinels and perovskites are phase separation systems. Importantly, multiferroicity may be lost when the interface lattice clamping is released, a compromise in annealing temperature needs thus to be found. We intend here to determine the local strain release within embedded platelets upon recrystallization by scanning X-ray microdiffraction.","1571":"Recently, Moir\u00e9 superlattices (MSL) of vdW structures have brought a new dimension to 2D electronics. MSLs are formed in homo or hetero-structured bilayer\r\n systems due to lattice mismatch or twist angle between them. The modified interlayer coupling in different domains in such MSLs result in electron localization,  which is manifested in the band-structure as flat-bands that facilitate electron correlations. Owing to this, remarkable effects such as superconductivity, have  been observed in such systems. Detailed structural studies of 2D-materials using surface-sensitive X-ray methods are sparse, but feasible as we have already  demonstrated. Here, we aim to study the local atomic structure of twisted bilayer MoS2 superlattice based microfabricated device structures to correlate with their  magneto-transport properties and understand the interlayer interaction, influence of local strain and twist angles on their performance.","1572":"The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of the Pd surface structure on the catalytic performance during acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation at room temperature. Open questions remain regarding the mechanism and the kinetics of acetylene adsorption and desorption on the different Miller indexed surfaces of Pd [1]. Using ultra-fast and stroboscopic Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI), we intend to map in situ and operando, the three-dimensional evolution of the deformation\/strain field of multi-faceted Pd nano-crystallites.

We expect a reduction of the measurement time from 10 hours per delay point to only 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n","1574":"The goal of this experiment is to obtain information regarding the stochastic behavior of VO2\u2019s insulating and metallic domain formation as a stimulus, current, is applied. By analyzing the 1D spatial maps collected in this experiment, we will be able to understand the metallic domain relaxation process as a function of current. This local nanoscale structure information will then be compared to the global resistive state of devices. We expect to see nanoscale filaments, formed by metallic puddles, connect the two metal leads as a result of the voltage pulses. Our collaborators intend to utilize these characteristics to fabricate neuromorphic and synapse-like devices for computational purposes. \r\n","1575":"Magnetic Bragg ptychography can surpass established SAXS geometry magnetic Coherent Diffraction Imaging methods (holography, ptycho-tomography) in the additional possibility to reveal local crystalline strain and also extend to antiferromagnetic materials. As opposed to SAXS geometry, which provides no contrast to antiferromagnetic domains textures, Bragg geometry provides this sensitivity from the pure and separate (from structural) antiferromagnetic Bragg peaks. Therefore, for the development of magnetic Bragg ptychography high flux hard X-rays are essential. This proposal is only feasible due to the ESRF EBS, together with the 10K cryostat and coherent X-ray nanobeam implemented on ID01. This experiment will perform magnetic Bragg ptychography using a pure magnetic scattering Bragg reflection. This will greatly aid the development of our adapted inversion algorithms, to include the vectorial nature of the magnetic scattering cross-section.","1576":"Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) uniquely enables the study of small crystalline samples with high strain sensitivity (~2 \u00d7 10\u22124) and high spatial resolution (~10 nm) in three-dimensions (3D). Here we propose to use BCDI to image magnetic domains within a single crystal of Sr2IrO4, a high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) analogue. We plan to image the (106) magnetic Bragg peak to observe the evolution of 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains in real space, complemented by collecting normal charge (116) Bragg peaks below and above TN = 225K. The two peaks will provide information on how magnetic domains evolve as a function of temperature, and how they are pinned to any defects in the lattice or are confined by the crystal morphology. This experiment will study the evolution of 3D magnetic domains and domain walls to understand fundamental magnetic interactions that make iridates analogous to superconducting cuprates.","1577":"A new family of kagome metals has emerged as a fertile playground to investigate correlation-driven topological phases. Among them, FeGe has been observed to host charge density waves and magnetism at 100 K and 400 K, respectively. Our diffuse scattering data indicates that the CDW results from a simultaneous condensation of phonons at L (\u00bd 0 \u00bd) and M points (\u00bd 0 0) of the BZ. Besides, a third CDW propagation vector with QCDW=0 0 \u00bd is observed below 100 K and interpreted as dimerization driven CDW. In this proposal, we want to solve the low temperature CDW phase of FeGe and discern whether dimerization, nesting or a disorder scenario are responsible for the charge modulations reported. For this, hard x-ray diffraction will provide the complete set of data and will allow us to understand the origin of the CDW in FeGe and learn how magnetism intertwins with the charge order. The results will be of extreme importance for the rapidly grown field of correlated topology and flat bands.  ","1578":"The dielectric response of the frustrated, quasi-1D quantum magnet Cs2Cu2Mo3O12 shows two components: a critical divergence at the quantum critical point, and an unusual relaxation at ultra-low temperatures. This feature is in complete agreement with a model of Debye relaxation of electric dipoles mediated by soft magnons, in a newly discovered multiferroic relaxation process. In contrast, the isostructural system Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 only shows the critical contribution. It is suspected that a reduction of lattice symmetry in Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 at low temperatures is responsible for the origin of the fundamentally distinct behavior. Therefore, determining the correct space groups at low temperatures of both materials is indispensable to understanding the origin of this exotic form of relaxation. Single crystal and powder diffraction will be combined to refine the chemical structures down to the lowest accessible temperature of 5 K.","1579":"Diffraction from ultra-thin single crystal films is predicted to deviate from what is usually known for bulk materials. For example, the position, integrated intensity and integral breadth of a diffraction peak cannot be related to the lattice spacing of the material or the number of unit cells along the diffraction vector. These predictions bear important consequences for the analysis of diffraction patterns from nanocrystals. They have not yet been confronted to experimental measurements performed on simple model systems. The aim of this proposed experiment is to investigate in detail the diffraction patterns from very clean ultrathin SOI films and confront these results to kinematic scattering calculations taking into account all nanodiffarction artefacts.","1580":"Carbides form a family of compounds important in science and technology due to their interesting chemical, mechanical, electrical, magnetic and optical properties. Structural variations as a function of composition and external parameters (pressure and temperature) often result in formation of carbides with various types of chemical bonding, as well as with fascinating crystal chemistry. \r\nThe high-pressure chemistry and physical properties of rare earth metal carbides are almost unknown. Here we propose to investigate the Ln-C (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Yb) systems up to 220 GPa by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). The diamonds are suggested to be used as the source of carbon (as the most enriched with carbon material). The main objectives of this proposal are a synthesis of new Ln-C compounds at multimegabar pressure, characterization of their crystal chemistry, tests of theoretical predictions, and search for regularities in lanthanides carbides chemistry.","1581":"The possibility to synthesize superhard materials from the light elements B, C, and N has attracted significant attention during the last century. Indeed, these elements can form multiple short and strong covalent bonds, thereby often displaying very high shear and bulk moduli (B0), both essential for achieving superhardness (Hv>40 GPa). The experimental studies have investigated only a small fraction of the chemical phase space\u2014largely restricted to the binary systems\u2014and pressure space, most often limited below 30 GPa. Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to investigate the B-C-N system up to pressures and temperatures of 130 GPa and 3000 K, in an effort to produce novel solids with remarkable properties. The new compounds\u2019 crystal structure, along with their stability range and bulk modulus, will be determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction of polycrystalline samples. This proposal directly builds on top of our recent successes with the C-N system.","1582":"    In order to unravel mechanism of glass transition and crystallization of metallic glass, we propose to perform in-situ heating PDF tests of monoatomic glassy Ta film which was developed by us recently. The reason is that, by using monoatomic metallic glass, coordination number and bonding length can be calculated, and the partial PDF problem will be totally avoided, and the crystallization product will be single phase which make Rietveld refinement possible. Based on such experimental data, we think that we will establish physical theory of glass transition and crystallization of metallic glass.","1583":"The crystalline ferromagnetic Fe65Ni35 alloy is known for its very low (almost zero) and constant thermal expansion coefficient below Curie temperature. This effect, named Invar effect, has been found in various ordered and random crystalline alloys. There is no unified explanation of the Invar effect in the field of magnetism and the full understanding is still lacking. A common explanation involves two local atomic arrangements of Fe that differ in their spin configuration and also their volume, however, there is no agreement on the exact nature of these arrangements. Fluctuations between these configurations are said to counteract thermal expansion.\r\nMeasuring the atomic-scale thermal expansion at cryogenic temperatures will provide insights into their existence and nature of different magneto-structural\r\nfluctuations in Fe-based bulk metallic glasses as well as uncovering the influence of rare-earth elements on the Invar effect.","1584":"The main goal of this proposal is to investigate low temperature crystal structure evolution across the N\u00e9el Temperature (TN) and some magnetic features observed from magnetic susceptibility for the Se(Ni1-xCox)O3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) perovskites, using the state-of-art high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffractometer available at the beamline ID22, ESRF. These are the most distorted perovskites, characterized by a huge tilting of the Ni(Co)O6 octahedra, due to the stereochemical effect of the lone electron pair of Se(IV). They must be prepared uinder high-pressure conditions.  The main questions to be addressed are the followings: (i) What is the correlation between the crystal structure evolution across the magnetic ordering temperature and the spin configuration at long-range, and (ii) how such a correlation evolves for the different members of the series from SeNiO3 to SeCoO3?","1585":"Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize magnetosomes, which are highly crystalline, reproducible, chemically stable magnetite nanoparticles (40\u201345 nm). Taking advantage of these model nanoparticles, we aim to unveil the temperature\u2013driven structural modifications undergone by magnetite at the nanoscale, a matter that has been under debate in the last decades, but still remains unclear. For this purpose, we will measure the X\u2013ray diffraction patterns in a wide range of temperature values above, close to, and below the Verwey transition (TV \u2248 120 K), which will allow us to correlate the modifications of the crystalline structure with the changes observed in the magnetic behaviour.","1586":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate the crystal structure of Eu2Pd3Sn at the long and local scale by means of X-ray powder diffraction and pair distribution function analyses, from room temperature down to 10 K. This compound exhibits a magnetic transition around 50 K. These data (in combination with complementary neutron powder diffraction data) are expected to evidence if possible structural transitions are associated with magnetic ordering and constitute a unique tool for gaining a correct description of the magnetic structure symmetry by applying representational analysis.","1587":"Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) are promising air-electrode materials for Solid Oxide Fuel and Electrolysis Cells (SOFCs and SOECs, respectively).  (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-d (LSCF) and (Ba,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-d (BSCF) systems are considered as state-of-the-art materials for solid oxide cells working at intermediate temperature (IT-SOCs); however, due to problems related to Co toxicity and its supplying, the search for alternative Co-free perovskites is crucial. Recently we undertook a study on the BSCuF system, both in the form of nanofibers and micrometric powders, respectively obtained through electrospinning and sol-gel processes. We propose to collect total scattering data on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\u2013\u03b4, as reference material, and on five different samples of the BSCuF system, both as powders and nanofibers, with the final aim to gain a deeper understanding of the structure at the local scale and correlate it with the electrochemical behaviour of the  corresponding cathodes.\r\n","1588":"The triangular lattice compound AgCrSe2 shows exciting and unusual magnetic and transport properties that are up to now only partially understood, in particular it's recently observed anomalous Hall effect. The system is a non-collinear antiferromagnet with TN~32K. But despite sizeable spin-orbit coupling due to the magnetic exchange via Se, the observed anomalous Hall conductivity should be symmetry forbidden in the published R3m crystal structure (no inversion symmetry). However, the physical properties, in particular the transport, are strongly dependent on the exact composition of the compound. We suggest an investigation of the crystal structure of samples with well characterised composition (stoichiometric vs. Ag-poor) down to temperatures below TN and above T~450K (transition to R-3m with restored inversion symmetry). A composition dependent additional symmetry breaking in analogy to the Ag(Cu)CrS2 sister compounds could explain the observed spectacular physical properties.","1589":"We aim at investigating the average and local structure of La2NiO4-xF2x intercalation cathodes for Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) as alternatives to Li batteries.   \r\nPXRD patterns will be collected in suitable x (0\u2264x\u22641.5) and T (100\u2264T\u2264600) ranges, so encompassing their operating range. \r\nThe data will be analyzed using Rietveld and PDF analysis, flanked by BVS and DFT calculations. \r\nAll expertizes (synthesis, data collecting and analysis, DFT calculations) are present in the proposing team.\r\nWe expect to map the structure of La2NiO4-xF2x samples as a function of x and T at different length scales spanning from the local order to the average structure. This study will establish the local distortions (tilting of octahedral, possible Ni-off centring) and the anion distribution in these compounds in different thermodynamic conditions and is a prerequisite also to understand the atomistic mechanisms of F- diffusion and intercalation within this family of compounds.","1590":"The project suggests in situ XRD study of Hummers graphite oxide (HGO) swelling in liquid 1-alcohols as a function of temperature. According to preliminary data, HGO immersed in long 1-alcohols (carbon numbers C14, C16, C18, C20) shows swelling transition at elevated temperatures with sharp change of inter-layer distance. HGO swelling in small alcohols (methanol and ethanol) is known from earlier studies to show completely different type of structural changes with absent of well defined swelling transitions. No studies were so far performed for HGO in other alcohols between ethanol (C2) and 1-pentadecanol C15. We suggest to study temperature dependence of swelling for HGO immersed in a set of liquid 1-alcohols with chain length C3 to C15.  It is expected that swelling transition will be observed for alcohols with C>9 and gradual changes of interlayer distance for smaller alcohols. Adding these data to already collected preliminary results will result in rapid publication.","1591":"The dosage of pharmaceuticals produced in non-crystalline phases, such as nanoparticles or glasses, has a great advantage due to their better bioavailability and solubility than crystalline counterparts. The modification of pharmaceutical by mechanical perturbation, e.g., milling or compaction, may lead to the desired amorphization of the structure that resembles the structure of glass produced by the standard vitrification. However, mechanically-stressed pharmaceuticals often exhibit distinct functional properties from ordinary glasses. The origin of these differences can be traced to the structure at the atomic and supramolecular levels. In this project, we are going to reveal the nature of the structural disorder introduced by milling and pressurization for selected active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The pair distribution function (PDF) is nowadays one of the most powerful tools to study the local structure and will be applied in this context for the amorphized APIs.","1592":"The electronic nematic phase, which is believed to be a precursor to the superconducting state in high-Tc iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), remains strongly debated. When electronic nematic fluctuations emerge, they reflect on the local environment by imposing subtle lattice modifications not resolved through the average structure. Total scattering studies are sought for a high-Tc (38 K) molecule-intercalated FeSe, where the increased interlayer distance decouples the Fe-selenide sheets, making it an ideal candidate to bring local structural instabilities into light. The experiments will make a model-dependent assessment of the local structure through PDF analysis. The aim is to conclude if the emergence of electronic correlations is responsible for symmetry-lowering transitions at the local level, akin to those accompanying nematic order in FeSCs. The work will shed light on the nature of nematic state and its relationship to the origin of superconducting pairing mechanism.","1593":"We recently reported on strong anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in heterostructures of non-magnetic SrIrO3 (SIO) and ferromagnetic LaCoO3 (LCO) which demonstrated proximity-induced ferromagnetism in SIO.[1] Latest experiments on SIO\/LCO heterostructures show large tunability of the AHE by electrostatic gating where the Hall conductivity or Hall angle was changed by up to 600%.[2] In contrast, the rather small Ir magnetic moment of  0.018 mB as deduced from x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Ir L edge,[3] raises question on the origin of the large AHE and its tuneability.  In the following, we therefore propose XMCD measurements at the Ir L edge at the beam line ID12 on a selection of high quality SIO\/LCO heterostructures to study the Ir magnetic moment as a function of the gate voltage Vg. Specifically, we aim to investigate the orbital and spin moment of Ir as well as possible changes in the density of unoccupied Ir 5d states as a function of Vg.","1594":"Recently a paper has appeared reporting a huge (factor of > 100) enhancement of the susceptibility in UO2 thin films (< 200 \u00c5) when such a film is deposited on a series of perovskite substrates. The only way to directly prove this startling (and potentially useful in spintronics) result is to measure several films with XMCD at the U M4,5 edges. Samples (deposited on LaAlO3) from a previous experiment of ours, and newer samples made at Bristol University, are available.","1595":"The aim of this proposal is to record with high accuracy XANES and XMCD spectra at the U-M4,5 edges in UB2 and UPt3.In addition we will also record spectra at the Pt-L2,3 edges in UPt3. XANES spectra the U-M4,5 edges will provide the branching ratio of the white lines and the expectation value of the angular part of the spin-orbit interaction the 5f states.Their values rely on the coupling scheme (intermediate or LS), the 5f electron count and their localization. XMCD data will allow to determinate the U-5f and Pt-5d orbital and spin moments and their ratios. Those information will give further indications on the number of 5f electrons and their delocalization. It is worth to emphasize that the 5f count in uranium intermetallics is in general controversial. Its knowledge is an essential piece of information for modeling their electronic structure.","1596":"The generation of pure spin currents via spin pumping in magnetic bilayers is one of the key effects for efficient spin-to-charge conversion. This project focuses on a combination of epitaxial Fe films as spin source and Rh films as spin sink. Our FMR studies show a spin pumping efficiency in Fe\/Rh comparable to the one of Fe\/Pt which opens a great potential for spin-to-charge conversion application including THz emission. Combining XMCD, ferromagnetic resonance and magnetometry, we will study the magnetic proximity effect on the interfacial spin transport and spin dynamics. Using XMCD, we will investigate the changes of orbital and spin magnetic moments due to interface polarization and alloying of Rh films grown on single crystalline Fe as a function of film thickness and growth conditions. This information will be correlated with electrical and spin transport properties of Fe\/Rh bilayers (spin pumping), g-factor, magnetic anisotropy, damping and THz emission measurements.","1597":"The van Hove singularity (VHS) is an important ingredient in the rich physics of two-dimensional electronic systems. Recently, high-order VHS has been reported in electronic twisted bilayer graphene and kagome metals, but the link between higher-order divergent DOS and electronic instabilities has not been established yet. Our recent medium resolution RIXS study shows that the magnon excitation of SrCuO2 displays characteristic resembling a high-order VHS. Our analysis further reveals enhanced quantum fluctuations that possibly result from the stronger singularity. However, the limit of energy resolution and the accessible range of reciprocal space preclude an unambiguous conclusion. Here, we propose to clarify the nature of the magnon VHS in SrCuO2 by exploring its out-of-plane dispersions using ultrahigh-resolution Cu L-edge RIXS. The realization of high-order magnon VHS will provide a new perspective in understanding the magnetism of cuprate superconductors.","1598":"Para-magnons are considered one of the possible bosons leading to Cooper pairing in cuprates. However, theory has long failed to describe the electronic state of doped cuprates, as they are difficult to treat with calculations that incorporate correlations. We are currently doing detailed first-principle calculations in oxychloride cuprates, including techniques that explicitly incorporate the electron-electron interactions and that are particularly well suited for our case. We will complete our study of paramagnons in oxychlorides, at the highest doping, in order to maximize the effect of the mobile charges on the magnetic excitation, as well as very low doping, in the pure pseudo-gap phase, in order to compare the results with our calculations.","1599":"The high-Tc cuprate superconductors feature a complex phase diagram involving various ordering phenomena besides superconductivity, such as charge and spin density waves. It has been widely suggested that antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, surviving upon doping the AFM Mott insulator parent compounds, play a key role in the cooper pairing mechanism and the formation of charge density waves in these materials. Our group recently succeeded in growing high quality thin films of La2-xCaxCuO4 (LCCO) in the overdoped regime with dopings up to x = 0.5 and observed that superconductivity as well as charge ordering surprisingly persists up to at least x = 0.5. Here, we propose to carry out Cu-L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) on LCCO thin films to systematically investigate the evolution of dispersive magnetic excitations in the overdoped regime. The aim is to understand the extent to which AFM fluctuations determine the superconducting and charge density wave phase boundaries.","1600":"Topological materials have attracted great research interest with the promise of developing novel electronic devices with new functionalities. Among these materials, MnBi2Te4 is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (TI) that can experimentally achieve quantized edge conductance at certain thicknesses. Further, by replacing Bi with Sb, the Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase can be induced in the material. Here, we propose a systematic study of the magnetism of a Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 series of topological TI\/WSM films with varying Bi:Sb ratio, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This composition-ratio dependent study will help to reveal the intimate relation between topology and magnetism in intrinsic magnetic TI\/WSMs, and therefore promote the development of high-efficiency spintronic applications in topological materials.","1601":"The nature and origin of charge order in high-temperature superconducting cuprates are still open questions. Recent measurements suggest that the long-range charge ordered phase emerges out of a broader regime characterized by short-range, and possibly dynamical, correlations. However, it remains unresolved whether the emergence develops through a quantum critical point or through a smooth crossover.  As resonant soft x-ray scattering techniques have proved to be one of the most sensitive techniques to probe charge correlations in cuprates, here we propose to study charge order around optimal doping with the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) technique. We plan to add another dimension to the cuprate phase diagram by combining RIXS with application of magnetic field. It enables us to clarify whether the long-range charge order can be field induced, which would support or stay in opposition to the quantum critical point scenario. ","1602":"Among the others, spin fluctuations are considered as the most promising candidate to mediate the pairing interaction in high Tc superconducting cuprates. The role of spin is nonetheless still debated, particularly as for the interplay with other degrees of freedom. Although high energy paramagnon excitations have been vastly studied in their doping dependence with RIXS, a temperature dependence study across the phase diagram is still missing. In this regard, we hereby propose to perform a full temperature dependence study of YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 samples at two distinct doping, also exploiting the unique capability of ID32 to measure the scattered photons polarization to disentangle the spin temperature effects to the charge excitations. If successful the experiment will represent the first study of high energy paramagnetic excitations across the superconducting transition in a cuprate superconductor, elucidating further their role in the unconventional pairing of these systems.","1603":"Infinite layer nickelates are the most interesting cuprate-akin materials, for being superconductive and for \r\nsharing several structural and electronic properties with high Tc superconductors. Among those is 2D \r\nantiferromagnetic background, as confirmed by the detection of magnetic spin waves with doping \r\ndependent energy and damping. Here, we propose to extend and complete our prior investigation of spin \r\nexcitations in Nd1-xSrxNiO2 films, by performing a polarization-resolved RIXS study, with the aim of\r\ndetermining the spin dynamical susceptibility. Throughout our analysis, the use of the polarimeter is \r\ncrucial to discern such excitations from the underlying charge continuum. By fitting the RIXS spectra, \r\nusing an extended Hubbard theoretical model already available to us, we will tune the key parameters and \r\ncompare them to those of cuprates. ","1604":"Recently, the novel oxide 2D-electron gases (2DEGs) discovered interfaces between quantum paraelectric KTaO3 and band insulating oxides attracted wide-spread interest due to the interplay between the large spin-orbit coupling of Ta-5d states and the superconductivity. Very surprisingly, these 2DEGs show very weak superconductivity at the (001) interface (Tc<50 mK), but robust Tc of 2.2K and 1.1 K at the (111) and (110) interfaces, respectively.\r\n Here, we propose polarization dependent Ta-NIII (Ta 4p->5d) [4] and O-K (O 1s->2p) [5] edges x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to establish the Ta-5d crystal-field symmetry and t2g splitting, and their relationship with the ground states in the 2DEGs formed at the (001), (110) and (111) interfaces between KTO, non-magnetic (LaAlO3, AlOx) and ferromagnetic (EuO) overlayers. In EuO\/KTO 2DEGs, we will also study magnetic correlation between Eu and Ta magnetic moments, by Eu-M4,5, Ta-NIII, and O-K edges x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).","1605":"Fe5GeTe2 (F5GT) is among the few van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets (FMs) having near-room temperature magnetic transition. Substitutional Co further increases the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (Tc) while reducing the Fe magnetic moment. These concomitant effects suggest an interplay between delocalized electrons and local moments that cannot be expressed in the frame of a purely itinerant electrons model. In this respect, Co-doped F5GT appears as an interesting platform where to explore spin dynamics in high Tc FMs. In this experiment, we propose to measure by RIXS the magnetic excitations in epitaxial F5GT and study the effects of Co doping on the spin wave dispersion. ","1606":"We propose to investigate the coupling phenomena between strain state, magnetic properties and ferroelectric properties in multiferroic composites made of embedded ferrimagnetic MFe2O4 (M = Mn and Co) spinel platelets in epitaxial ferroelectric BaTiO3 (001) layers. Taking advantage of the RIXS-MCD setup of ID32 beamline, we will analyze RIXS maps and XMCD spectra while tuning in situ the electrical polarization and therefore causing lattice deformation due to piezoelectric effects. The main aim is to observe the variations in the magnetic response to the applied electrical field at saturated magnetic field and different temperatures. This study will enable us to determine the magneto-electric (ME) coefficient in artificial multiferroic thin films, which are of great interest as sensing components for 2D spintronic devices. Probing such property in the nanometer range is highly challenging and requires a novel approach.","1607":"Thanks to the progress in 2D materials technology, van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibiting intriguing long-range magnetic order can be synthesized by epitaxial methods down to the monolayer. Substrate choice is crucial as it influences 2D magnetic order of the layer, making it difficult or helpful the achievement of desired properties. Our preliminary XAS\/XMCD studies on epitaxial chromium trichloride, CrCl3, monolayers (MLs) grown by MBE on Au(111) showed that these MLs are intrinsically ferromagnetic at low temperature, however no magnetic crystalline anisotropy was observed. We propose to perform in situ XMCD measurements of CrCl3 MLs grown on single-layer graphene, which in turn is grown on either magnetic or non-magnetic substrates. We aim to prove the ability of the substrate in tuning the magnetic properties of vdW magnetic materials through proximity-induced phenomena.","1608":"A recent inelastic neutron scattering study on Co3Sn2S2 reported low-energy spin waves up to 40 meV and a resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study with linear polarized incident X-rays reported correlation driven near-flat band Stoner excitations. However, our RIXS measurements at the ADRESS\/SLS employing a magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) analysis suggests that the \u201cnear-flat band\u201d is quite dispersive and its intensity reduces upon approaching Tc. Applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T to fully polarize the spin will allow extracting the dynamic magnetism with circular polarized X-ray. However, due to limited energy resolution, we were unable to clearly resolve the spin waves from the asymmetric elastic peak. We therefore propose here to study Co3Sn2S2 by high-resolution MCD RIXS at ID32 to resolve the spin wave excitations, including the acoustic and optical mode, in which the latter is more likely to form the \u201ctrue\u201d flat band due to the kagome lattice structure.","1609":"La1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-d (LSCF) and Ba1-xSrxCo1-yFeyO3-d (BSCF) systems are the most promising mixed ionic-electronic conductors to be used as air-electrodes in Solid Oxide Fuel and Electrolysis Cells working at intermediate temperature. Due to the increasing interest of the scientific community towards Co-free electrodes, we undertook a study on the Ba1-xSrxCu1-yFeyO3-\u03b4 system (BSCuF), synthesizing samples with different stoichiometries, both in the form of micrometric powders (sol-gel process), and electrospun nanofibers, to test their performances in symmetrical button cells. To deeper understand the electrochemical behaviour of BSCuF, we will collect XAS spectra on the reference La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\u2013\u03b4 and on several BSCuF electrodes. Spectra will be also collected on the same electrodes after several working cycles, to evaluate the correlations between their structure and their deterioration.

We\u2019ll focus on the structural changes probed by XRD under pressure. We are particularly interested in the evolution of the crystal structure, the pressure variation of the unit cell parameters, volume and crystal symmetry. We also aim to investigate the influence of the nature of the (H, D) isotope on the crystal lattice under pressure, i.e., H\/D isotopic effect by measuring ScFe2D3.14 and ScFe2H3.58 under pressure in comparison to ScFe2 reference. Ambient pressure studies have revealed that the structural and physical properties are very sensitive to chemical pressure. XRD experiments under pressure will allow us to establish a correspondence between chemical and external pressure. Sc1-xNbxFe2(H,D)y is a remarkable example of itinerant electron magnetism with a large interplay between physical properties and volume\/pressure.","1611":"The 6H-hexagonal perovskite iridates Ba3M4+Ir2O9 with Ir4+ ions located on the vertices of a triangular lattice have been serving as potential paradigm in search for novel quantum magnetic ground states. The M= Ti and Zr refute any kind of magnetic ordering in both the dc magnetization and specific heat data, despite having significant antiferromagnetic Ir-Ir exchange, promoting towards strongly quantum entangled spin liquid candidates. However, the presence of local chemical disorder as well as the mixed valency of Ir in the perovskite lattice disrupts the QSL phase, often giving rise to th spin-freezing phenomenon. At this point, it would be of extreme importance to have systematic investigation of the local atomic site-order\/disorder and determination of the true Ir-valence, as well as to elucidate the effective spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength in these two materials. So, we propose to perform the Ir-L2, L3 edges XAFS [combined XANES and EXAFS] study.","1612":"This proposal aims to investigate the anomalous behavior of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) in Zn2GeO4 compound and how it can be controlled by appropriated doping with light ions (Li or Mg). Materials which exhibit NTE are of great interest because of the possibility to create compounds with a tunable coefficient of thermal expansion in some specific temperature ranges. However, a full understanding and controlling of NTE mechanisms are still challenging since this behavior can be driven by different mechanisms, such as low-wavenumber phonons, spontaneous polarization, or charge transfer phenomena. Therefore, this study envisages the use of the XAS beamlines BM23\/ID24-DCM station to shed light on the NTE at local level of Zn2GeO4 nanocrystals, being complemented by high-resolution X-ray diffraction data from HR-XRD beamline ID22. We expected to better understand the mechanisms of NTE in Zn2GeO4, which may enable a full controll of their intrinsic thermal expansion.","1613":"The proposed EXAFS aims to solve the local environment of molten Cs halides infiltrated in SBA-15 mesoporous silica that could reveal the existence of tensile strains (i.e. negative pressure) exerted by the silica nanochannel walls. We expect changes in coordination number and in Cs-Halide Ion bond length distributions as the melt is infiltrated in the nanochannels. These results could support the hypothesis of the relevance of negative pressure as the driving force for the stabilization of low-density polymorphs in nanoscale confinement instead of the standard explanations based on surface energy arguments.  ","1614":"The double perovskites A2BB\u2019O6 with 3d and 5d transition metals in B and B\u2019 sites have unique electronic and magnetic properties due to high crystal fields and strong spin-orbit coupling. These samples can be used as hard magnets or in spintronics applications. Our objective is to unravel the interplay between the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties at high pressures, for the first time. At ambient conditions, it is known that structural distortions originate magnetic and electronic transitions simply by changing the ionic radius of A cation. Therefore, the application of high pressure will enable us to discover emerging electronic and magnetic modifications. We propose to study A2FeIrO6 (A = Ba, Sr, Ca) by using x-ray absorption spectroscopy up to 80 GPa, the only technique that allows to study simultaneously the local structure, crystal fields, and the spin-orbit coupling.","1615":"The aim of this proposal is to obtain a ternary hydride by mixing two metals that are known to form binary superhydrides. In hydrogen at Mbar pressures, Y and Fe form binary superhydrides, respectively: YH6 with a cage-like H sublattice [5], and FeH5 with atomic H layers [6]. We will thus search for a ternary superhydride in the Y-Fe-H system. This is a continuation of the proposal HC-5070 in which a remarkable uptake of hydrogen under pressure by YFe2 up to YFe2H7 has been characterized. Hints for a transition to a YxFeyHz compound have been observed above 60 GPa. The beamtime will be devoted to solving the structure of YxFeyHz by single-crystal XRD and to measuring its equation of state and metastability range by decreasing pressure to ambient condition. Other compounds will be searched by exploring the 60-160 GPa range. Ab-initio calculations will then be performed to determine the structure of the H sublattice.","1616":"The intense x-rays available at EBS-ESRF are known to be able to trigger undesired effects, like structural and chemical modifications in radiation sensitive materials. This apparent obstacle can also lead to the discovery of new, surprising, physical phenomena. Recently, we observed a structural expansion of a Ce65Al10Co25 metallic glass (MG) during high pressure compression which appears related to an x-ray induced or photocatalytic reactions between the MG and the pressure transmitting medium. We propose, here, to couple high pressure x-ray diffraction and x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the structural evolution occurring in this glass under different chemical environments and irradiation conditions to trigger and control the transition and quantify the corresponding structural changes. A successful experiment will lead to the determination of the microscopic mechanisms behind the transition, and provide insights on the anomalous equation of state of the newly formed MG.","1617":"Iridium is one of the most incompressible element within the family of 5d metals and it is the only refractory metal with a face-centred cubic structure. It has a number of exceptional properties, such as: high shear modulus, chemical inertness, high thermal and phase stability. For these reasons it is a very good candidate as gasket material or as pressure standard for high temperature and high pressure diamond-anvil cell experiments. However, the stability of its fcc structure under pressure has been debated for years and so far there is not experimental evidences of its melting curve. Therefore, we propose to perform a thorough investigation of the P-T phase diagram of iridium up to 180 GPa and 1300 K combining resistively-heated DAC (RH-DAC) and x-ray diffraction techniques. In this way we will be able to point out any possible solid-solid phase transition or anomalies linked to a predicted core-level crossing electronic transition and,extract its PVT equation of state.","1618":"The aim of this proposal is to solve the structure of the high-pressure solid phases of ammonia hydrates through single-crystal synchrotron XRD in the 10-20 GPa, 300-700 K range. Ammonia hydrates are fascinating systems for fundamental sciences as archetype compounds forming hydrogen (H) bonds but also for planetary sciences as major components of the icy planets. Constraining the interior structure of celestial bodies requires information on H2O\/NH3 mixtures of various compositions and over a large range of pressure (P) and temperature (T). We have investigated the high P [50 GPa]-high T [800K] phase diagrams of the three ammonia hydrates and discovered a general behavior, in particular the occurrence in three hydrates of \u201cquasi-bcc\u201d phases. The structure, O\/N and H ordering of these phases are still unknown and will be studied in this proposal by single-crystal XRD experiments. ","1619":"With the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bcc-H3S with the critical temperature of Tc = 203 K at 150 GPa the search for novel superconducting hydrides became the most active topic in the field of high-pressure research. The most straightforward way to reduce the synthesis pressure of bcc-H3S is to substitute sulfur with selenium.","1620":"Recent models and observations suggest that organic matter (OM) is a major compound of the refractory cores of the icy moons of the solar system. This OM would have interacted with large amounts of water only during the accretion and differentiation of these bodies (before\/during the formation of the refractory core). Inside larger water-rich exoplanets, these interactions could have happened at conditions above the critical point of water, leading to the efficient dissolution of the OM and to the formation of specific alteration minerals and volatiles (as was shown in our previous experiments). However, during the formation of the smaller icy moons of the solar system, water is not expected to have reached a supercritical state. The evolution of the OM in these conditions remains largely unknown. We propose to use in situ powder and single-crystal XRD, on anvil cell samples of OM and water, to establish a comprehensive picture of the fate of OM during the formation of icy moons.","1622":"Charge density wave (CDW) ordering in SmNiC2 is followed at lower temperatures by the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Sm moments. Below the FM onset, the CDW order is fully suppressed, evidencing a strong interplay between the two types of ordering. The CDW suppression was attributed to the weakening of the Fermi surface nesting conditions, which are relevant to the formation of the CDW, in the FM state. In contrast, ab initio calculations indicate that hydrostatic pressure (HP) improves the nesting conditions and therefore favours the CDW formation. HP electrical resistivity experiments showed that the CDW onset increases under HP, while parallely the FM transition temperature decreases, and suggested the presence of a hidden FM quantum critical point. Here we will explore directly the pressure evolution of charge ordering and its interplay with magnetism in this system, while monitoring its crystal structure, through a HP x-ray diffraction study of SmNiC2 single crystals.","1623":"The aim of the present proposal is to study the gradual uptake of hydrogen by manganese and to synthesize the predicted MnH7 [5]. This superhydride structure is remarkable by having a mixed H sublattice, with one hydrogen being under the molecular form and the other ones under an atomic form. By measuring the excess volume per H atom from the compression curve, we will question if MnH7 can be considered an additive-volume alloy of Mn and metal H, as for all other superhydrides [6]. Finally, we will investigate if nuclear quantum effects can change the sequence of the MnHx compounds stable under pressure: in particular, cal-culations predict that MnH4 is stable but probably not MnD4 [5].","1624":"Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed by polyhedral water cages of different size filled with gas molecules in a non-stochiometric ratio. Under high pressure conditions most of gas hydrates transform gas-filled ices, constituted by a water-ice skeleton isostructural to one of the low pressure ice phases filled with gas molecules in its channels. The gas molecules prevent the empty ice structure to collapse exerting a strong hydrophobic repulsion on the water molecules, and are in such a way confined at remarkable high densities in the ice skeleton. In a recent HP powder diffraction experiment on the ID 15 beamline we have observed the formation of the DFT predicted C3 phase of the hydrogen-hydrate. This filled ice is based on ice Ic frame and has an exceptionally high H2O: 2H2 ratio. Here we propose a new experiment on the Id28 beamtime to fully determine C3 structure, including H2 positions, by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. This study is part of a PhD thesis project.","1625":"High pressure superhydrides provide an exciting route to finding room temperature superconductivity. Currently, LaH10 holds the record for the highest experimentally confirmed critical temperature (Tc) at a pressure of 200 GPa. It is now important to find high Tc superconducting materials at lower pressure. We will synthesise and study the ternary hydride LaBeH8, which has recently been predicted to have a Tc of 192 K at 100 GPa, and to be dynamically stable down to 20 GPa. We will use laser-heating and X-ray diffraction to search for avenues to synthesise LaBeH8 and will probe the range of dynamical stability. Based on this information, we will prepare high quality samples for electrical measurements at the University of Bristol. This project offers the prospect to achieve a record Tc below 20 GPa. Furthermore it will help to understand the mechanism behind superconductivity in hydride compounds. ","1626":"The purpose of the proposed experiments is to apply methods of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) in laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DACs) in order to determine crystal structures and chemical compositions of possible high-pressure phase(s) in Ir-B system up to 150 GPa.","1627":"The in-situ determination of a material\u2019s elastic tensor at high pressure is of the highest importance for numerous fields of research, namely materials science, condensed matter physics, and geophysics where it is the cornerstone of seismology. As it stands, no method exists to obtain this information from highly heterogeneous and opaque samples. In this innovative proposal, we aim to combine two new, but well-established and highly synergistic approaches\u2014X-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction of polycrystals (SC-XRDp)\u2014that together enable the full elastic tensor determination of high-pressure high-temperature in-situ synthesized polycrystals, irrespectively of their transparency or chemical heterogeneity. This novel methodology will be demonstrated on: bridgmanite (MgSiO3) and two phases of Fe2O3, the perovskite and post-perovskite phases. ","1628":"For calcium hydrides, CaHn (n=2, 4, 6\u2026) were predicted to have stable structures at high pressure and show superconductivity. We just discovered experimentally the superconductivity with critical temperature Tc~ 210 K in Ca-H system. The materials are synthesized at the conditions of 160~210 GPa and ~1800 K in DAC combining with in-situ laser heating technique. The superconductivity was studied through the in-situ high pressure resistance measurements. We performed high pressure XRD experiment at room temperature and tentatively assigned the superconducting phase as CaH6 [Nature Communications, 13, 2863, 2022]. However, the superconducting state of this hydride is at around 200 K, instead of room temperature, the previous XRD experiments was not performed at correct P-T conditions yet. Therefore, we plan to carry out corresponding low temperature XRD experiment at around 160~200 GPa conditions to solve this puzzle. ","1629":"Up to date the most promising candidates for ultimate phonon-mediated superconductivity in binary systems are novel crystal structures of a clathrate-type compounds of MH68, MH129 and MH1810 composition (where M is Mg, Sc, La, Ce, Hf, Zr metal) with the developed 3D H-based networks. Among different predicted phases, Fmmm-LaH18 (270 K at 300 GPa), Im-3m-MgH6 (270 K at 350 GPa), Immm-ScH12 (320 K at 300 GPa), Pm-3-MgH12 (375 K at 350 GPa) are stable at pressures, which are achievable in experiment.\r\nThe main goal of our project is to synthesize the novel hydrogen-enriched lanthanum, scandium and magnesium hydride phases with promising high Tcs and determine their pressure\/temperature stability fields. Recently we regularly achieve pressures above 400 GPa by improving the shape of diamond anvils. This allows us to study YH94 at \uf07e400 GPa and gold up to 477 GPa11.\r\n","1630":"The aim of this proposal is to study the properties (structure, dilatation coefficient) and thermodynamic P-T boundaries of the superionic phase of ammonia in the range 40-100 GPa and 300-3500 K. Superionic ammonia is characterized by a fast diffusion of the protons through the persistent nitrogen lattice. Since ammonia is an important component of the interior of icy planets and exoplanets, the precise knowledge of the P-T range of stability of superionic ammonia and of its physical properties is needed to determine whether the isentropes of these planets cross this phase. Recently, the existence of two different phases of superionic ammonia has been claimed. Nevertheless, there is to date no confirmation of this phase by independent experiments nor recent theoretical calculations, and no information on its structure\/EOS are available. We propose here to explore the structural evolution of superionic ammonia to identify accurately the different regimes\/structures.","1631":"Recent experiments have demonstrated an astonishing close-to-room-temperature superconductivity (Tc ~ 250 K) in laser-heated Y-H and La-H mixtures between 170 GPa and 200 GPa. While this is a game-changer in our understanding of condensed matter physics, these pressures are far too high for technological applications. Scandium hydrides, which are largely unexplored experimentally at high pressures, are predicted by computational calculations to also form several high-Tc superconducting new structures, including a promising ScH12 solid with a calculated Tc of 313 K below 100 GPa. The here proposed study will investigate laser-heated Sc-H mixtures between 40 and 250 GPa, in pursuit of the theoretically predicted wealth of Sc-H stoichiometries and structures, some featuring very high Tc values. Unit cell and Sc atom\u2019s arrangement will be extracted by single-crystal X-ray diffraction sample characterization.","1632":"CrMnFeCoNi is a prototypical high-entropy alloy (HEA), along with other 3d metal HEAs, that typically displays a paramagnetic face-centered cubic (fcc) phase when prepared under normal conditions. While theoretical calculations indicate that the ferrimagnetic body-centered cubic (bcc) phase of CrMnFeCoNi has comparable total energy to the fcc phase, it has not yet been observed experimentally. In this study, we successfully produced this metastable bcc phase by annealing an amorphous film and measured the temperature-induced crystallization processes. As a fundamental thermodynamic variable, pressure can effectively alter the bulk density and local atomic structure. Based on the predicted hexagonal close-packed (hcp) ground state, it is speculated that an amorphous (bcc)-hcp transition could occur, and this could be explored further using high-pressure X-ray diffraction.","1633":"We propose to study nano-scale density inhomogeneities in metallic glasses (MGs) and how they relate to the stability and mechanical properties of the glasses, using nano-tomography at ID16A. Recent studies have shown that density inhomogeneities on the length scale of 200nm and above, and up to 20% in magnitude, can exist in melt-quenched MGs. However, it is unknown how these density inhomogeneities relate to the preparation method and thermal history of the MGs. Phase-contrast X-ray tomography at ID16A is well suited to answer this question thanks to its capability to detect low-level electron density fluctuations. The results are relevant to both the physical nature of the glass transition and industrial applications based on the mechanical properties of MGs.","1634":"The fabrication of performant rare-earth free permanent magnets (PM) using single crystalline Co nanorods (NRs) requires to control the formation of dense and parallel assemblies from a colloidal suspension. These assemblies results from a complex 3-steps dynamic process occurring with very different time-scales : i) the NR alignment under an external field (ms), ii) their migration toward zones of high field gradient (s) and iii) their densification during the drying step (min). In operando studies coupling USAXS, SAXS and WAXS will allow to follow in real time the migration and the densification of Co NRs under magnetic field at the characteristic length of the NR crystallites (\u00c5), interparticle distance (10\u2019s - 100\u2019s of nm) and of the pre-aligned fibers (\u00b5m). The impact of the experimental parameters (solvent, concentration, magnetic field) on the orientation distribution function will allow guiding the fabrication of rare-earth free PM with enhanced properties.","1635":"We propose to study the nematic phase transition of FeSe by measuring Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering (REXS) at selected \u201cforbidden\u201d reflections at the Fe K edge. This nematic phase transition is not accompanied by magnetic ordering, unlike in most other Fe-based superconductors, which makes this crystal an excellent opportunity to study the former without the latter and to deepen our understanding of nematic phase transitions in the vast class of Fe-based superconductors. The hk0 forbidden reflections should be extremely sensitive to any change of the local environment of the Fe atoms, due to the high symmetry of the crystallographic sites of Fe. In addition, we will pay attention to other anomalies reported in the physical properties at other temperatures, and we will look for possible intra-unit-cell magnetism at low temperature.\r\n","1636":"In this proposal, we would like to carry out anomalous x-ray scattering (AXS) experiments on Dy-TM (TM = Co, Ni, Fe) metallic glasses (MGs) to obtain the relationship between the cryogenic rejuvenation effect and the changes in the local atomic structures. Our recent AXS experiments on a Gd65Co35 MG demonstrated that small but distinct structural changes were observed even in the first neighbouring shells by the rejuvenation effect with a temperature cycling between liquid N2 and room temperatures [1]. Ketov et al. [2] examined the presence of such an effect in the context of structural and elastic heterogeneities in MGs. Hufnagel [3] suggested that the effect should be caused in the atomistic configurations. We expect to clarify that structural changes universally occur in MGs by the rejuvenation effect, although depending on the extent of structural\/elastic heterogeneities.","1637":"The forbidden reflection is caused by the crystal symmetry in the diffraction of radiation whose energy is far from the absorption edges as known as the extinction rules. They can nevertheless be \u201cswitched on\u201d close to an absorption edge, due to the anisotropy of the resonant tensor of scattering. Resonant \u201cforbidden\u201d reflections have been studied in many crystals. However, the resonant forbidden reflections for an aperiodic crystal has never been observed yet. The objective of this study is to measure the forbidden reflection for aperiodic crystals. In this study, the Al-Cu-Rh (Al58Cu38Rh4) quasicrystal is focused as an aperiodic crystal.","1638":"Frustrated magnetic materials can show unconventional spin configurations such as quantum spin liquid states and monopole excitations in spin ices. These phenomena are observed on uniformly frustrated lattices such as triangular, kagome or pyrochlore types, where all nearest neighbor interactions are equivalent. GeFe2O4 crystallizes in a direct spinel structure for which the magnetic 3d6 Fe2+ are located in the Oh sites and thus form a pyrochlore sublattice. If these phases are relatively well understood in bulk, their structure in thin films (cationic distribution, positions of the atoms, and oxidation states) is still completely unknown. X-ray resonant diffraction is the best adapted technique for this aim, if not the only available one, for it allows discrimination between the involved cations and necessitates small amounts of matter.","1639":"We propose here to perform a pump and probe X-ray diffraction experiment to study the structural changes induced by laser illumination. Chalcogenide glasses show numerous interesting, and often puzzling, effects when irradiated with a laser (i.e., refractive index and density variations). Although the phenomenology of these effects has been studied and discussed, their microscopic origin is still debated. The majority of the proposed models postulates that the impinging photons trigger atomic rearrangement, but there are not detailed structural studies. With the proposed experiment we aim at understanding the structural variations caused by the photons and their role on the photoinduced phenomena.","1640":"In this proposal we plan to investigate tailored time-dependent strain fields as a new route to control the electronic states of nanoscale quantum objects in semiconductors. We aim to employ picosecond strain pulses to control the recombination dynamics of excitons trapped in low-dimensional nanostructures. Strain pulses are excited using a photoacoustic method and monitored via time-resolved Brillouin scattering. We focus on the structural dynamics after optical generation of coherent acoustic phonons. Time-resolved x-ray diffraction will be applied to first determine the nanomechanical eigenmodes of the nanocrystal assembly and second to control the acoustic modes of the nanostructure by multiple consecutive optical excitations. Sufficient temporal resolution is achieved by slicing the x-ray probe beam with an ultrafast photoacoustic Bragg switch. Based on this information we want to quantify the transient deformation due to photoacoustic strain in InP nanocrystals.","1641":"This proposal aims at measuring the lattice dynamics associated with acoustic wave propagation in insulating to metal nanocrystals excited by an ultra-short laser pulse. We have demonstrated  that strain propagation is the pathway for ultrafast phase transformation in this material. Here we will measure the effect of pure acoustic waves, probing lattice distortion and phase transition as a function of depth below the excited surface, and along the surface.","1642":"We propose the room-temperature, ultrafast XRD experiment on the magnetic kagome metal, Fe3Sn2, to study its structural changes upon optical pumping. This compound is a magnetic Weyl semimetal that combines topologically non-trivial band structures and flat-band ferromagnetism, both arising from the underlying kagome network of the Fe atoms. Our previous optical pump-probe transient reflectivity investigations suggested a unique interplay between phonons and the electronic structure in this compound. Here, we seek to understand the underlying structural changes that govern ultrafast dynamics of Fe3Sn2.","1643":"When exposed to hard X-rays, network glasses rearrange their internal configuration with only minor changes in the average local structure. This process is very weakly temperature dependent and recent results show a dynamics that can be described as an hyper-transport process. These results have been observed only in a single material and some key questions are still open. With this experiment we plan to verify the existence of this hyper transport in different systems and to characterize in more detail its puzzling properties.","1644":"We propose to study the atomic relaxation dynamics of the Ce-Al MGs during both compression and decompression from ambient pressure through the polyamorphic transition and eventually close-to-crystallization pressure (~25 GPa) at room temperature. These results will provide critical dynamic information for us to understand the transition process and underlying mechanism for the unusual phenomena in Ce-Al MGs and also the relationship between dynamics and structures of glasses in general. ","1645":"During a recent XPCS beamtime at DESY we probed the dynamical response of a metallic glass (MG) of Zr46.8Ti8.2Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 (vit4) and we obtained the first experimental evidence of a fast secondary beta-relaxation process in a glass, prior to the main structural relaxation which results in a double decay of the intermediate scattering functions (ISFs) in the ms time scale. Due to the low signal to noise ratio available at low Qs and short times scales, we could not characterize neither the wave-vector dependence of the beta-relaxation nor its evolution with temperature. For this purpose, we propose here to use the large coherent flux offered by XPCS at ESRF-EBS to probe for the first time the temporal evolution of the beta-relaxation in a MG across the glass-transition temperature. A successful experiment will deepen our understanding on the glassy dynamics from an extended scale and may unveil the physical origin for the recently reported string-like atomic motions in MGs. ","1646":"Ferropericlase ((MgxFe1-x)O, x > 0.5) is the second most abundant mineral of the Earth\u2019s lower mantle with a proportion around 16-20% and the solid solution between FeO and MgO ((Mg,Fe)O) is considered to be one of the major components of rocky planets, too. Iron, one of the three elements in the solid solution, is of particular interest as it is one of the abundant major elements in the mantle that may vary in oxidation and spin state with pressure and temperature. The high-pressure electronic properties, spin state, and phase stability of ferropericlase are critical to understanding the properties of and processes taking place in the mantle and have been subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies. We propose to perform shock compression experiments at ID24-ED HPFL to study the electronic structure of Fe by both pre-edge and main edge features in compressed (Mg,Fe)O and track iron valence states of the (Mg,Fe)O solid solutions along its Hugoniot path.","1647":"Introducing lattice strain in functional materials is an unconventional strategy to boost their energy efficiency and performance beyond classic limits. Our \u2018lab-on-chip\u2019 approach consists of a single wafer device in which thousands of identical films are present under different strain conditions, in contrast to state-of-the-art approaches where only single strain levels are achieved. Here, the aim is to apply spatially resolved XAS to chart the structural and electronic property evolution across a broad and quasi-continuous range of strain conditions applied by the lab-on-chip device. By applying this approach for metal and metal halide perovskite thin films, unparalleled laws will be established between (i) the applied strain and (ii) the structure and electronic material properties, ultimately enabling one-to-one links to their performance. ","1648":"The proposed experiment aims to investigate the pressure-evolution of cerium valence in Ce2Pd2In intermetallic compound. Application of pressure was found to result in suppression of long-range magnetic order at pc \u2248 4 GPa accompanied by the Kondo anomaly formation. Pressure was found to result in formation of Ce-atomic arrangement strongly supporting geometrical frustration as one of mechanisms potentially responsible for suppression of magnetism. However, eventual cerium 4f1 valence instability, often accompanied by development of the Kondo screening effect, cannot be neglected. XAS is a unique tool enabling to discriminate the valence state of the magnetic Ce atoms because of the drastic differences of spectral features between Ce 4f1-4f0. High-pressure XAS measurements will therefore provide an important insight into the underlying physics at the microscale and thus will permit to complete the picture of the pressure-driven development of Ce2Pd2In magnetism.","1649":"Using time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, we propose to  study the field and temperature induced valence fluctuation in a particular model system, Eu(Rh1-xIrx)2Si2 series. Main aim of the proposal is to identify possible differences in the effects of field and temperature on the average Eu valence within and beyond the critical end point of an existing first order valence transition . A systematic comparison of the field and temperature dependencies of the valence in the vicinity of the critical end point has long been desired, but never been performed using direct probes such as XAS. Expected data will be useful for better understanding the nature of field induced valence fluctuation and relevant field induced phenomena.

Samples will be synthesized by means of a novel sputtering-based method which allows us to tune the temporal profile of multicomponent deposition fluxes, and thereby atomic arrangements, with sub-monolayer resolution. Concurrently, EXAFS is the tool of choice for revealing the element-specific local atomic environment for each pair of atomic species in compositionally complex materials. The selected binary alloys are ideal model systems the study of which will provide us with unique insights into fundamental mechanisms that govern atomic self-assembly at the nanoscale. The latter is a major roadblock faced today by the materials science community towards developing strategies for creating bespoke materials.\r\n","1651":"The proposed experiment is an inelastic x-ray scattering study to map the temperature dependence of the phonon dispersion in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) 2H-TaS2. 2H-TaS2 has been shown to form a charge density wave (CDW) below ~76 K. Here, we want to observe the collapse of the phonon as the CDW is formed, at the CDW q vector (0.341, 0, 0)a*. 2H-TaS2 has also been shown to be superconducting below ~1 K, with a strong crystallographic anisotropy. As seen in other TMD materials, the superconducting state could be heavily affected by the CDW state, specifically, the anisotropy. Therefore, studying the nature of the CDW state can give us information about both the CDW state as well as the superconducting state.","1652":"In spite of a long history many electronic and lattice properties of the quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 remain puzzling. Last year we have discovered a novel ingredient that sets its ground state. We found that the softening of the TO mode is accompanied by a large TA softening at a tiny q-vector pointing to the existence of fluctuating domains as wide as 20 nm. Motivated by our results it has been proposed that quantum paraelectrics are driven by a flexo-electric coupling that leads to longrange-ordered modulated phase. Here we apply for five days of experiment on Cristal to study the diffuse scattering associated with this TA softening and its evolution in the ferroelectric phase of SrTiO3 (through the substitution with Ca doping). This result may reveal the presence of an hidden incommensurate transition in the quantum paraelectric phase of SrTiO3.","1653":"The aim of the project is to investigate the origin of ferroelectricity in the simple binary oxide hafnia HfO2. We propose to measure for the first time the phonon dispersion of ferroelectric hafnia crystals Y:HfO2 by inelastic X-ray scattering complemented by diffuse scattering measurements. The objective is to verify the presence of a nearly dispersionless phonon branch controlling the different phases of hafnia (polar and antipolar). The observation of a flat, strongly temperature phonon band would be key to verify our current understanding of ferroelectricity in this system. ","1654":"The proposal aims to explore in situ the changes in the lattice dynamics during the electrochemical reduction of Pr2NiO4.25 showing sub-mesoscale oxygen ordering to Pr2NiO4.0. The study will enable to monitor the energy dependence of the soft mode behavior in Pr2NiO4+d  with the charge transfer, i.e. the oxygen content, over the whole stoichiometry range. It will allow to conclude on the interplay between sub-mesoscale oxygen ordering and low-T oxygen mobility via a modified lattice dynamics in terms of a phonon assisted diffusion model.","1655":"This proposal aims at tracking the temperature dependence of the vibrational modes of technologically relevant semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs): MoSe2 and WS2. Inelastic xray scattering (IXS) is to be applied to measure the energy dispersion and width of the phonon modes of TMDs bulk crystals, as a function of temperature. The dispersion curves will be combined with vibrational density of states (vDOS), to identify the phonons modes involved in phonon-phonon, electron-phonon and exciton-phonon interactions, at the base of the temperature dependent, optical and transport properties of TMDs. Moreover, this study is to provide quantitative inputs for benchmarking atomistic models of mechanical (e.g. elastic tensor and moduli) and thermal (e.g. specific heat) properties of TMDs. These results will guide the device engineering and expand our understanding of phonon mediated processes in van der Waals crystals.","1656":"Complex metallic alloys are fascinating materials, which despite seemingly simple chemical composition show surprisingly complex structures containing\r\n hundreds and thousand atoms per unit cell. Finding such phases is complicated due to the fact that they appear at low temperatures where diffusion is slow, and\r\n thus even when the temperature of their formation is known apriori their synthesis sometimes requires months of annealing.\r\n\r\nIn this work we propose single crystal x-ray diffuse scattering as a probe for the discovery of complex intermetallic phases. Diffuse scattering allows to capture\r\n such complex phases in the early stages, when they manifest only as weak local ordering. As a result, it diffuse scattering efficiently guide synthesis by suggesting  the phase regions and temperature ranges where ordering will likely take place. We will test the applicability of this method on Cd1-xAux near x=1\/4, which is known to have a number of long-range modulated phases.","1657":"We propose to image antiferromagnetic domains in pyrochlore iridates (RE2Ir2O7, RE = Rare Earth) by scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy, using resonant X-ray scattering as magnetic contrast. At low temperature, both the Ir4+ and RE3+ sublattices host so-called \u201cAll-In-All-Out\u201d magnetic orders with antiphase domains. These antiphase domains have been evidenced by various techniques, but their coincidence on both sublattices remains to be studied. Only X-rays, using absorption edges of both sublattices, are able to provide distinct pictures of the domain structures in both sublattices. This missing information is crucial to understand how such domains can be manipulated. Indeed, it has been suggested that magnetic monopoles in the RE sublattice could be used to manipulate the domains of the Ir4+ sublattice. If this first experiment is successful, it could lead to further studies under magnetic field, possibly with the full-field diffraction microscope of the beamline.","1658":"Platinum group metal nanoparticles are frequently used as catalysts in a large number of relevant (electro)-chemical processes. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the effect of the Pt surface structure on catalytic performance during cyclic voltammetry. Open questions remain regarding the mechanism and the kinetics of adsorption during the hydrogen oxidation reaction on the different Miller indexed surfaces of Pt. Using stroboscopic Bragg coherent x-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI), we intend to map in situ, the three-dimensional evolution of the deformation\/strain field of multi-faceted Pt nano-crystallites as a function of applied potential. This will yield the 3D strain map at millisecond timescales during the cyclic voltammetry process. Real time fast scans will inform on sample degradation at high potentials with a temporal resolution of <20 s. his experiment will complement previous studies carried out at ID01 beamline.","1659":"We aim to utilize Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) to elucidate how pure and PtRh nanoparticle covered ceria nanocubes behave under reduction and oxidation conditions, as well as CO oxidation conditions. We will utilize the strain- and shape-sensitivity of the CXDI technique i) to investigate how reduction and oxidation induced compositional changes in the near surface region and in the bulk of ceria nanocubes can be traced by Bragg CDI, since the induction of vacancies leads to a change in lattice parameter, and ii) to track the shape and strain state of a ceria nanocube overgrown with lattice-matched PtRh alloy epitaxial nanoparticles, which exhibit a significantly improved CO oxidation activity at low temperatures, since ceria serves as a reservoir for oxygen.","1660":"The kinetics of Hydrogen and Deuterium Evolution Reactions (HER\/DER) are pivotal in advancing hydrogen-based energy conversion technologies like electrolyzers and fuel cells. This project aims to investigate both the thermodynamics and kinetics governing the ad-, ab-, and desorption processes of hydrogen and deuterium onto palladium nano-crystallites (NCs). Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), we intend to dynamically visualize, in situ, the three-dimensional evolution of the deformation and strain fields within Pd nano-crystallites in an electrochemical cell during H2O and D2O electrolysis. This study will shed light on the fundamental differences in the kinetics of HER and DER processes on Pd, focusing on elucidating the impact of isotope substitution (H to D) on the underlying reaction pathways.","1661":"Diffraction limited storage ring (DLSR) synchrotrons such as the ESRF-EBS, APS - Upgrade and others increase the coherent hard x-ray flux density by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to previous sources. We propose a novel coherent diffraction imaging technique to capitalize on this revolutionary flux and enable near-atomic to atomic resolution Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (AR-BCDI). This method is based on a incorporating molecular dynamic simulations and maximum likelihood estimation methods. We request beamtime at the upgraded ESRF-EBS beamline ID01 to gather the necessary multi-reflection Bragg peak data and demonstrate its feasibility which has been rigorously tested via simulation. ID01 is one of a few possible facilities currently world-wide that has sufficient coherent flux density for this demonstration. ","1662":"The aim of this proposal is to locally map the interstitial oxygen concentration, using diffuse scattering, of individual grains and grain boundaries of niobium.\r\nSamples, pre-characterized concerning the exact grain shape and orientation in selected marked areas, will be used. The outcome serves as relevant input for the\r\ndescription of the properties of niobium-based radio-frequency cavities within the disordered superconductor theory.","1663":"Electrically conducting ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) show great potential as active elements in a new generation of nanoelectronic devices: their controlled nucleation, movement, and annhilation would allow for the deterministic reconfiguration of conductive pathways within such device. Conductive DWs are conventionally found in wide-gap ferroelectrics, where the conductivity arises from local changes in carrier density due to the accumulation of screening charges at polar discontinuities. We have recently discovered that DWs can be conductive also in narrow-gap materials with a strong charge-lattice coupling, such as the Mott insulator GaV4S8. Based on scanning probe measurements, we believe that the DW conductivity arises from the large surface reconstruction that accompanies the Jahn-Teller transition in this material. We propose to validate this hypothesis by performing scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy at DWs, measuring the strain in their vicinity,","1664":"The requested beamtime is the key part of the four-years long research project (\u201cEnabling accurate X-ray structural analysis and domains reconstruction in ferroelectric PbZr1-xTixO3 crystals\u201d) granted to our research group by the Israel Science Foundation. We propose designing and customizing the novel type of single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collection that combines a) chemical crystallography, b) high-resolution reciprocal space mapping and c) X-ray topo-tomography. The specific goal of the experiment is to gain a single-crystal quality X-ray diffraction data set from a multi-domain BaTiO3 and two PbZr1-xTixO3 single crystals. We request beamtime at the BM01 beamline, which meets all the experimental requirements","1665":"Hydrophobic porous materials are potential candidates for energy storage. ZIF-8 and ZIF-71 were listed among the first candidates for storing mechanical energy by means of the p\u0394V work (p - pressure of intrusion, \u0394V - volume of the pores filled by the liquid). Our recent studies on ZIF-8 revealed that the flexibility of the lattice is a crucial factor in determining other properties of the material like the intrusion pressure and the size of the hysteresis. Additionally, the quality of the sample turned out to be important in determining stability under applied water pressure.\r\nUnfortunately, the intrusion pressure of ZIF-71 at 70 MPa is above many sample environments, therefore out initial structural studies were carried out only in the pre-intrusion region. The new setup available at the SNBL, which could potentially reach 100 MPa, will be used to overcome this obstacle and complete the study.\r\n","1666":"Our proposal aims to conduct high-pressure x-ray diffraction investigations on single crystals of the orthorhombic polymorph of Fe(PM-Bia)2(NCS)2 (PM-Bia=N-(2'- pyridylmethylene)-4-amino-bi-phenyl)  utilizing our advanced diamond anvil cells (DACs) optimized both for synchrotron and neutron single-crystal diffraction and characterized by a wide opening angle of 110\u00b0.  In this research endeavor, we seek to study the evolution of complex structural changes in the vicinity of the critical pressure point 2.02 GPa with a pressure resolution of 0.1-0.2 GPa. This pressure point is of special significance, as, from our previous investigations, we find that it corresponds to the formation of a superstructure in the compound. The use of our wide-angle DACs maximizes accessibility to reciprocal space, particularly beneficial for exploring low-symmetry structures. ","1667":"We aim to explore the growth and epitaxy of magnetite nanoparticles on SrTiO3(100) (STO) by in-situ grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. We will monitor the role of temperature and oxygen pressure in growth, epitaxy and orientation of the nanoparticles. Form reciprocal space maps, we will elucidate the 3D shape of the nanoparticles and possible surface reconstructions on the nanoparticle facets. Furthermore, we will study the adsorption of formic acid and oleic acid on these nanoparticles and record possible adsorption-induced shape changes. Our results will deliver important insight into the fundamental properties of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles on STO and their relation to Fe3O4 single crystal surfaces, which we have investigated previously. They will elucidate how the adsorption of organic acids modifies the nanoparticle shape and composition, which is essential for the properties of novel materials based on organic acid-coated magnetite nanoparticles.","1668":"The aim of this experiment is to measure the interfacial stress fields that lead to functional fatigue in materials that undergo martensitic phase transformations (MPTs) such as shape memory alloys (SMAs). MPT is a diffusionless, often reversible phase transformation between a high-symmetry and a low-symmetry phase. It is the enabling mechanism behind the novel properties of SMAs and TRIP steels, but functional fatigue continues to be a major barrier. Functional fatigue is caused by stress fields that form at the phase interface and lead to dislocation generation. We plan to use dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) to measure these interfacial stress fields during stress-induced MPT, using a mechanical load frame. A strong factor in the fatigue properties is the kinematic compatibility.  NiTiPd SMAs have tunable kinematic compatibility and several compositions will be mechanically cycled to observe how dislocations develop and influence the functional fatigue behavior.","1669":"We will investigate the coupling between strain and the metal-insulator phase transition (the Verwey transition) in the canonical compound, magnetite. We have shown (HC-4565) that strain caused by lattice imperfections affects the transition temperature, TV as the externally induced strain does. We have also proved before existence of the electronic phase separation below TV that certainly causes some intrinsic strain. Eventually, the low T phase does posssess natural crystallographic domains, i.e. also strain that may affect the transition. A picture of the extent and location of these strains, as well as their link with the transition temperature is clearly missing. We have good reasons to believe that we can close this gap with DFXM installed once in ID06-HXM, and now operating at ID03.","1670":"The synthesis and investigation of rare-earth metals carbonitrides under high pressure allows to produce new compounds and find relationship between their structures and properties. Previously it was shown that synthesis under high pressure greatly expands the variety of chemistry of carbides and nitrides with potentially promising properties. Some of reported compounds are recoverable at ambient conditions that emphasizes the significance and potential of this research field.\r\nHere we propose to synthesize and solve the crystal structures of novel rare-earth metals trinary compounds Me-C-N (Me = Y, La, Sm, Dy) in the pressure range up to 120 GPa. The initial reagents will be the rare-earth metals dicarbides and loaded N2. The main objectives of this proposal are a synthesis of new rare-earth metals carbonitrides Me-C-N at multimegabar pressure, characterization of their crystal chemistry and compressional behaviour, and search for regularities in their chemistry.\r\n","1672":"Competition exists in the high temperature cuprate superconductors between the superconducting (SC), pseudogap and ordered charge density wave (CDW)\r\nstates. A key doping level for understanding these competitions has been the 1\/8 doping level, where an anomaly in the superconducting dome occurs (e.g., La2- xBaxCuO4), that is concomitant with a first order structural phase transition and is understood to supress 3D superconductivity. However, very recently we have shown that this structural phase transition does not run to completion, suggesting a natural explanation for the persistence of only 2D (in plane) SC at the 1\/8 anomaly. We propose to carry out a diffraction resolved tomography experiment on a surrogate system to map out how the structural domains associated with the suppression of the 3D superconducting state percolate.","1673":"The study of novel nitrogen-based compounds is an extremely compelling one. As technological solids, these systems can be used for their high energy density or superhard properties as well as to build empirical chemical knowledge. In recent history, nitrogen has been studied as part of binary systems with the majority of the periodic table. However, one family of elements has yet to be studied: the halogens. This proposal focuses on one of these systems, N-Cl, using laser-heated diamond anvil cells up to 130 GPa and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). ","1674":"Glasses are ubiquitous in our everyday life and play a key role in many scientific and industrial applications. Chalcogenide glasses are a family of semiconductors which are highly photosensitive: visible or NIR photons can lead, for example, to modifications of the bandgap (photodarkening) and photo-expansion. With this proposal, we want to explore the structural modifications in some chalcogenide glasses exposed to visible and near infrared photons through x-ray diffuse total scattering. We will study glasses irradiated at different doses and compare the structural effects of excitons, radiolysis, and knock-on events.","1675":"We are going to perform total scattering experiments with sp2-carbon-linked 2D c-COFs in order to reveal its structure. Since the system is not crystalline, pair distribution function analysis will be exploited to determine at least local structure that is the most crucial for possible applications. Tempearature evolution of the structure will be studied.","1676":"We have recently identified a transition from positive to zero to negative thermal expansion by fluoride doping NbO2F. Anionic control over thermal expansion is a novel approach and the mechanism through which it operates is currently not fully understood. Analysis of local structure through the x-ray pair distribution function (PDF) at different temperatures will allow us to separate the influences of anion order from dynamic distortions, and would help to develop this new field of anionic control of thermal expansion.","1678":"Understanding the control parameters influencing orbital order (cooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions) in the solid state is crucial to optimising technologically relevant properties. While oxide-based perovskites have received significant interest with extensive structural characterisation and theoretical investigations, fluoride analogues, ABF3 have comparatively under investigated. We have recently prepared ABF3 perovskites (where A = Na+, K+ and B = Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+) and propose to systematically study the low-temperature structural behaviour of key compositions to identify any orbital order (OO) driven phase transitions, bridging the gap in the literature. We will explore the interplay between crystal structure distortion, lattice strain and electronic degeneracy within the t2g orbitals. Our results will provide a broader understanding of crystal chemistry control parameters associated with the technologically relevant orbital ordering phase transitions. ","1679":"We will study structural transformations in RuCl3, RuBr3, and RuI3, the van der Waals magnets with honeycomb networks of Ru3+ ions that feature relativistic (spin-orbit-coupled) magnetic moments. These materials received attention in the context of Kitaev magnetism as possible hosts for exotic quantum states, such as quantum spin liquid. However, little is known about their structural transformations and stability regions of different polymorphs. It is also unknown at which temperature thermal decomposition of Ru3+ trihalides starts and which products it yields. This question is particularly relevant in the context of unexpected metallic-like properties that were recently reported in the nominally insulating RuCl3. ","1680":"The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is widely studied in materials with both magnetic and ferroelectric order, enabling potentially transformative low power logic and memory devices and new fundamental science in systems with coupled order parameters. Nearly all ME systems are insulating, where an applied electric field is used to manipulate magnetic order. However, metallic systems with inversion symmetry breaking and large spin orbit coupling can also exhibit ME coupling where neither magnetism or ferroelectricity are present in the ground state. These systems, which exhibit current-induced changes in magnetic order, are rare, particularly at room temperature. Here, we propose to measure XMCD on a promising current-induced magnetization system. Direct XMCD measurements would provide direct evidence of current-driven magnetization. Successful demonstration of current-induced magnetization at room temperature would represent a significant advancement in the field of ME coupling. ","1681":"First-order magnetic transitions involve structural, magnetic and electronic changes that are relatively well described at the scale of a unit cell. They have established spectacular consequences on bulk physical properties such as magnetization, transport or thermal properties, which form the basis of their applications. However, the intermediate micrometric length scale remains widely unexplored and poorly described. We seek to understand how a field induced para- to ferro-magnetic first-order transition develop locally in comparison to the overall macroscopic response in physical properties. Taking advantage of the XMCD magnetic contrast and the possibility to focus the beam to a micrometric size, we will perform simultaneous XMCD imaging and bulk physical measurements on one MnFe(P,Si) single-crystal and one polycrystalline sample.","1682":"The proposal\u2019s target is to measure high magnetic field X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of vanadium (V) at K-edge in two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet (AFM) VBr3 to quantitatively probe the orbital occupation in a polarized state. Confirmation of a non-zero orbital moment in VBr3 is crucial for understanding the origin of strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The XMCD signal at the V K-edge (not directly involving d-bands) originates from a spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-zero OM in the final p-band and possible hybridization between p and d-bands. Therefore, one might expect a robust K-edge XMCD signal if OM in VBr3 is not quenched, making this technique well-suited for our study. ","1683":"We propose to employ element-specific x-ray magnetic dichroism to investigate the local spin configuration in thin films of RuO2, a prime member of a new class of compensated magnets: altermagnets. While the existence of linear dichroism in compensated magnets is well established, we aim to experimentally demonstrate that, apart from the ferromagnetic or non-collinear order, circular dichroism can also originate from the collinear altermagnetic order resulting in a spin split band structure. The proposed experiment will exploit the unique capabilities of beamline ID12, offering large magnetic fields required to manipulate compensated magnetic materials, and full X-ray polarization control.","1684":"Since the magnetic fields of first-order transitions, such as FOMP, spin-flop, are much higher than the demagnetizing field of the sample, most models imply that the sample is always in a single-domain state and the magnetic moments of the atoms rotate coherently in the field. Nonetheless, this assumption may be overly simplistic, and a high-field domain structure could emerge during such field-induced transition, resulting in an alternative transition mechanism, and it is crucial to thoroughly investigate this phenomenon in detail. The main goal of this proposal is to observe and explore an intermediate element-specific domain structure at the FOMP transition in Tb2Fe17 and Er2Fe17 single crystals. We also aim to study the nucleation and growth of ferromagnetic domains during spin-flop transition in Nd6Fe13Cu single crystals. The obtained results will serve as a base for new model of field induced transition, developing by our group.","1685":"Recent experimental and theoretical studies in cuprate high Tc superconductors (HTS) have linked charge density fluctuations (CDF), precursors of charge density waves, to the strange metal phase. While their existence is now firmly established, there is still much to discover about their spatial structure and their connection with breathing phonons. In particular, a recent paper has attributed the softening of these phonons to \u201cquasi-circular charge correlations\u201d instead of CDF. To address these questions, we will employ RIXS on YBCO films and analyze CDW, CDF and breathing phonons as a function of the azimuthal angle, spanning from the (H,0) to the (0,K) direction. This will enable us to track the spatial distribution of the CDF peak and determine which charge modulation is responsible for the softening of the breathing phonons. Ultimately, our findings will confirm whether CDF indeed drive the unconventional phenomenology of the strange metal phase.","1686":"The presence of static charge order (CO) and dynamic charge order correlations is pervasive throughout the cuprate family [1]. Recently, by using phonon softening as a marker for the presence of dynamic CO correlations in RIXS measurements as a function of azimuthal angle \u03d5, we reported a manifold of quasi-circular dynamic correlations (QCDCs) in the qx-qy plane of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212) [2]. Using the same methodology, we seek to explore the QCDCs in La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 (LNSCO, x=0.125) both through the q-mapping that proved insightful in Bi-2212 and to study the temperature dependence of the QCDCs (of particular interest in LNSCO due its sharp structural phase transition). We propose to track how the softening of the bond stretching phonon in LNSCO evolves as a function of temperature around q=|q|=qCO, the preliminary results of which are already promising.","1687":"We propose to perform X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements on Mn-doped graphene, as an extreme model case of multi-channel Kondo effect, which in turn is one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics today. Combined with state-of-the-art numerical renormalization-group (NRG) calculations, implementing a three-band NRG model, this XMCD experiment will allow us to reach the deepest understanding of Kondo physics in graphene to date.","1688":"The versatility of Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) in disentangling the properties of elementary excitations is established to investigate the cuprate high-temperature superconductors (CuSC). In these materials, charge and spin degrees of freedom are intertwined and give rise to a complex phase diagram [1]. Here, we propose RIXS experiments of both Cu L3 and O K-edges for 3 compositions of hole-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+\u03b4 (Bi2212) to examine the evolution of spin and charge excitations across the charge-ordered and Fermi liquid regions of its phase diagram. We will probe paramagnon and charge excitations with a focus on the latter, specifically on the evolution of the recently discovered acoustic plasmon branch of the charge excitations in hole-doped cuprates [2].","1689":"Exploring infinite-layer nickelate properties is a topic of current interest. Our initial measurements unveiled strain-induced XAS dichroism, indicating significant electronic structure modification. We propose to perform Ni L3-edge RIXS on free-standing, strained nickelate membranes to investigate orbital, magnon, and phonon evolution. These findings will deepen our understanding of nickelate electronic structure and serve as a milestone for RIXS studies on strained quantum material membranes.","1690":"We observed in our capped Nd0.95Sr0.05NiO2 thin films a photo-induced resistance downturn. We plan to perform resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\r\nexperiments at the Ni-L3 edge under UV light, to discriminate interfacial effects from the \u2018pure\u2019 multiorbital nature of the electronic structure of infinite-layer\r\nnickelates. The idea is to use both -0.6 eV energy-loss spectral feature and magnons properties (energy and damping), as an indirect proxy to the possible\r\nsuperconducting state of the system under UV illumination. According to our experience on the system we can expect under UV an intensity decreases and\r\nsmearing out of those features. In this way, we will demonstrate that a superconducting state can be stabilized in infinite-layer nickelate thin films, as a result of\r\nphoto-induced modification of the charges in the two-orbital-channels describing the superconductivity in this system, hence, excluding a priori interfacial effects.","1691":"The kagome lattice geometry can give rise to dispersionless spin or electron manifold states, which can develop emergent quantum phases such as the fractional quantum Hall state or unconventional superconductivity. In the metallic kagome ferromagnet Fe3Sn2, we observed a flat spin wave band showing unconventional amplitude in the long wavelength limit. While the energy of the flat band and the dispersion of the acoustic mode follows a simple nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, another dispersive optic mode, which is also predicted in the model, is not resolved due to the limitation of the resolution. This mode and its amplitude is very important for the comprehensive understanding of the unconventional behavior of the spin waves. Thus, we propose to study the momentum dependence of the spin waves in Fe3Sn2 with high-resolution RIXS. The results will determine the spin Hamiltonian of this material and develop our understanding of the exotic spin and electron states in kagome magnets.","1692":"Thermal expansion represents a problem when dimensional stability of structures or devices is desired in applications that undergo a temperature fluctuation. Therefore the control of thermal expansion represents a challenge for materials design and the negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials are essential to achieve this goal. Recently, we have found out a novel YbNiAl4 family which exhibits NTE in a wide temperature range. Moreover, the NTE can be suppressed or, more interestingly, enhanced, by replacing some chemical elements (Figure 1), thus allowing the control of thermal expansion. Because there is no idea about the origin of this intriguing thermal expansion behaviour, we aim to investigate the local structure, valance state and local dynamics of these YbNiAl4 compounds by means of temperature-dependent XAFS spectroscopy. This would help to shed light on this interesting phenomenon, providing an important step towards the design of controlled thermal expansion materials.","1693":"This proposal aims to investigate the anomalous behavior of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) in Zn2GeO4 compound and how it can be tuned by appropriated doping with light ions (Li or Mg). Materials which exhibit NTE are of great interest because of the possibility to create compounds with a tunable coefficient of thermal expansion in specific temperature ranges. However, a full understanding and controlling of NTE mechanisms are still a scientific challenging since this behavior can be driven by different mechanisms, such as low-wavenumber phonons, spontaneous polarization, or charge transfer phenomena. Therefore, this study envisages the use of the high-brilliance XAS beamline BM23 station to shed light on the NTE at local level of Zn2GeO4 nanocrystals. We expected to better understand the mechanisms of NTE in Zn2GeO4, which may enable a full control of their intrinsic thermal expansion","1694":"During catalytic reactions, heat is released on or extracted from the catalyst. This leads to strong catalyst temperature changes, on its turn triggering restructuring and undesired side reactions. Here, XRD will be pioneered as novel tool in combination with XAS to probe the temperature of metal nanoparticles and the support for the first time selectively and operando in real-time. By monitoring the changes in the lattice spacing (XRD) and the Debye-Waller factor (XAS), thermally induced lattice expansion\/disorder will be linked to the temperature. This will enable to unravel temperature heterogeneities in the catalyst, chart heat transport and reaction rates, and in general provide a first-of-its-kind temperature bookkeeping in catalysis.","1695":"The HP allotropes of Hafnia, HfO2, have attracted attention for decades because of their potential for applications ranging from hard oxide coatings to resistive-switch memories. HP experiments have reported bulk moduli up to 340 GPa for the recoverable ortho-II phase using XRD at 300K; however, this approach can lead to big uncertainties, especially for highly incompressible materials; furthermore, direct measurements of the material\u2019s hardness are scarce, and no recovery of the HP ortho-I phase was reported.\r\nHere, we propose to use the setup at ID06-LVP to combine in situ structural and ultrasonic interferometry measurements to provide the first reliable estimation of the adiabatic bulk and shear moduli of HfO2 at HP-HT conditions. This information will be essential to assess the capabilities and opportunities for its wide-ranging applications. Furthermore, we will optimize the synthesis and recovery P-T pathways, still lacking for the ortho-I phase.\r\n","1696":"In quantum materials, correlated phases with comparable energy scales often give rise to competing orders. In the recently discovered correlated kagome metal ScV6Sn6, we have recently reported two competing charge density waves (CDW), driven by the momentum dependent electron phonon interaction. In this proposal, we want to measure the temperature dependence of the long range CDW with propagation vector 1\/3 1\/3 1\/3 and the fluctuating charge precursor at L=1\/2 under different values of uniaxial pressure. By breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry of the kagome net, we aim at tuning and controlling the competition between the different charge orders, the electron-phonon interaction and the phonon fluctuations derived from the flat-ish character of the phonon bands.     ","1697":"This proposal aims to observe the superionic transition in a uranium superhydride, UH8, chosen for its potential superionic transition and as a below-100 GPa synthesized superhydride [3]. The superionic transition is expected to manifest as a crossover with significant thermal expansion near it, leading to a Schottky-like bump in the linear thermal coefficient [4]. This transition is also expected to stabilize UH8 at a very high temperature due to the configurational entropy of the disordered hydride ions. Observing UH8 melting temperature closely matching that of pure U, whereas the melting of UH3 and UH7 would be at a significantly lower temperature than pure U, would also indirectly demonstrate the superionic state.\r\nXRD measurements of UH3, UH7 and UH8 in a laser-heating DAC will be conducted by following isobaric thermal ramps. Ongoing ab initio simulations will support experimental findings.\r\n\r\n","1698":"We have discovered that sodium melting curve exhibits a pronounced minimum  at \u223c118 gigapascals and 300 kelvin. We also have found seven crystalline phases of Na at around this minimum. Currently, the full structural information  of only three out of seven phases (oP8, cI16 and tI19)  is available.  The remaining  phases are incredibly complex, arguably among the most complicated structural  configurations observed in the elements - tI50, aP90, oC120 and mP512.  The complexity of the phase behavior above 100 gigapascals suggests extraordinary liquid and solid states of sodium at extreme conditions and has implications for other seemingly simple metals.\r\nIn the past decade there were several technological advances which reshaped the modern high-pressure experimental single crystal spectroscopy. Using the current  detectors, significantly improved diamond anvil cells and powerful software we will solve the structures of the remaining complex phases and look for the new ones.\r\n  ","1699":"Single crystals of alpha\u2019-Ce will be produced around high hydrostatic pressure of 10 GPa in diamond anvil cells. They will be compressed at 300 K to produce the higher pressure epsilon-Ce phase, or decompressed to produce lower pressure alpha-Ce and gamma-Ce. Mechanisms of the transformations will be characterized from orientation relations. The equation of state of cerium will be measured up to 150 GPa. ","1700":"The bandgap closure of solid hydrogen into a molecular metal has recently been experimentally observed, but its detailed electronic and structural characterizations remain at the very edge of current high pressure physics capabilities. In 1983, N. Ashcroft suggested the possibility to use impurities to lower the hydrogen metallization transition pressure. The recent discovery of SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content discovered so far, offers to put in practice that prediction. The insulator to metal transition by bandgap closure in Sr-doped molecular hydrogen compound is expected to occur around 220 GPa.\r\nThis proposal aims at reproducing the synthesis of the SrH22 compound, to obtain it in pure form to be able to refine its structure, and to determine its pressure stability range and the structural changes upon entering the metal state. The structural study will be complemented by IR absorption measurements in our laboratory to measure the bandgap closure.","1701":"The present proposal seeks to perform high resolution X-ray diffraction measurement of UO2 single crystals immersed in H2O media under reduced atmosphere conditions of He, Ar and Xe up to pressures of 20 GPa. Under intrinsic conditions UO2 is established to be stable as fluorite in space group Fm-3m until 40 GPa. However, we have recently demonstrated under oxidising conditions and when exposed to H\u00ac2O, UO2 can transform to U3O7 at pressures as low as 6 GPa. The present proposal seeks to establish if such phenomena can occur under reducing conditions (He, Ar and Xe) and particularly those directly relevant to spent nuclear fuel (SNF) when stored in a geological repository. The proposed proposal is thereby relevant to both general actinide chemistry, high-pressure science in addition to SNF disposal practises. The experiment is intended to be performed using either the high-pressure beamlines ID15B or ID27, which are both perfectly equipped for such work to be successfully completed.

The aim of this proposal is to clarify the relationship between superconductivity and this structural transition by performing an XRD study of La\u00ac 327 powder under pressure and from 300K down to 5K to check the crystal structure of the superconducting phase. The use of a better hydrostatic PTM (neon or helium) than in the previous studies (oil or solid media) will allow an accurate determination of the full P,T phase diagram.","1703":"We propose room-temperature high-pressure XRD studies on the chiral compounds CoSi and RhSi.

A switch of chirality\r\n by external stimuli may open a new route toward tailoring topological metals and other chiral materials and observe the changes in electronic and magnetic\r\n structure. We plan to implement chirality change under well-controlled quasi-hydrostatic conditions and address the following questions: (i) What causes the\r\n chirality change?

(iii) Is this change reversible?\r\n","1704":"The Nickel ferrite, which is known to belong to the inverse spinel family (cubic F-3m space group) exhibits ferromagnetism below 870 K. Recently it has been reported that this system also exhibits ferroelectricity below 98K, concomitant to a structural distortion from Fd\\bar{3}m to the P4122 space group. While our attempt to confirm this structural distortion at low temperature failed so far, our recent X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements under pressure and at room temperature surprisingly revealed the presence of a wide transition occurring between 30 and 55 GPa, which nature remain puzzling. This proposal aims at characterizing, in detail, the crystallographic structure of the spinel NiFe2O4 at low and room temperature, ambient pressure and above 55 GPa to have a complete overview of the (Pressure - Temperature) structural phase diagram of this system.","1705":"The objective is to study in situ the structural behaviour of the iron-magnesium binary systems during isothermal compressions at different temperature (1500K,\r\n1800K and 2000K from 20-40 GPa to 100 GPa) in order to obtain new experimental data which will be used for the reassessment of Fe-Mg CALPHAD High\r\ntemperature-High pressure thermodynamic model. This modelling represents an important end-member and is decisive for providing relevant thermodynamic\r\nmodelling of more complex oxidized systems, applicable then to geophysical environments.","1706":"Gas hydrates, found in pressurized environments like Earth's seabed or icy bodies in our Solar System, are able to efficiently store fuel gases like methane or hydrogen. In the HC-5060 experiment, we discovered a new high-density C3 hydrogen hydrate (H2O\u00b72H2)  in temperature-quenched, laser-heated samples at P>40 GPa. This phase has the highest gravimetric hydrogen density (>0.25 kg\/L) reported up to date. This proposal aims to systematically investigate its pressure-temperature stability range through in situ laser heating X-ray diffraction experiments. We seek insights into its formation mechanism, whether it results from solid-solid phase transition or direct crystallization from the solution. Understanding this compound's stability, structures, and formation mechanisms is crucial for explaining its role in exoplanetary dynamics, icy body formation, and high-density hydrogen-bearing materials' agglomeration.","1707":"The objective of this proposal is to investigate the evolution of the atomic lattice and the electronic order in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials as a function of their thickness, ranging from bulk to few-layer and ultimately two-dimensional (2D) systems. These materials exhibit remarkable changes in their macroscopic physical properties as they approach the 2D limit, which are of great interest for novel technological applications. We want to employ state-of-the-art x-ray diffraction (XRD) to monitor the structural changes as a function of thickness, temperature and pressure in nano-flakes of the prototypical vdW material 1T-IrTe2, which hosts electronic order and superconductivity and may exhibit a complex interplay between them. The accurate determination of the atomic structure will allow us to construct realistic theoretical models that effectively capture the electronic structure of this material when its thickness approaches the 2D-limit.","1708":"Despite having a rich structural complexity and an unusual electron band configuration, cerium (Ce) has only been studied up to 208 GPa, using energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction techniques. We propose to perform angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements on Ce metal, obtaining high-quality compression data to at least 300 GPa. Preliminary work conducted by our group has indicated that the c\/a ratio of the body-centred tetragonal (bct) phase stable above 12 GPa starts to decrease above 200 GPa. We have also seen abnormal compressive behaviour at pressures above 250 GPa, which may be a result of shear stress effects or pressure gradients. These data were acquired using a relatively large ~2\u00b5m FWHM beam, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. We therefore aim to repeat this experiment using the superior facilities at ID27. ","1709":"Nitrogen is an archetypical system to understand the essential effects of pressure on simple molecules. Notably, first-principle simulations predict a singular first-order transition from a semiconducting molecular fluid to a metallic polymeric one at high P-T. Before the upgrade of the ESRF and thanks to the developments performed during our long-term project HD-463 we were able to measure the structure factor of laser heated fluid nitrogen in the megabar range. This allowed us to demonstrate that molecular fluid nitrogen is stable up to at least 110 GPa and 2500 K. This proposal aims at pursuing these measurements in order to reach the predicted stability domain of the polymeric fluid. ","1710":"The recent discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 with a Tc close to 80K at pressures above 14GPa has generated considerable attention and calls for further investigation of the underlying mechanism. While the structure of the high-pressure phase that accommodates superconductivity could only be guessed from powder diffraction and theoretical calculations, a detailed single crystal diffraction study would provide the necessary structural details to prove the hypothesis that superconductivity is enabled by a strong mixing of nickel and oxygen orbitals. To address this aspect, we propose a detailed quantitative analysis of scattering intensities that allows not only to resolve structural uncertainties but also enables a direct visualisation of the electron density redistribution across the superconducting phase transition using multipolar refinement and refinement of experimental wave functions. ","1711":"Silicon is one of the most promising anode materials in solid-state batteries due to its very high specific capacity. Current results are however still in an infant state in terms of electrochemical performance, analytical characterization and mechanistic understanding. During lithiation\/delithation, Si undergoes a substantial \u223c300 % volume change, can lead to structural damage. The underlying electro-chemo-mechanical behavior of Si anodes remains so far inadequately understood and validating theoretical models has proven to be a challenging task. The objective is to precisely quantify the evolution of cross-sectional stress distributions in thin Si films with varying grain boundary morphology during lithiation and delithiation processes. To achieve this, we will employ cross-sectional X-ray nanodiffraction to characterize Si and LixSi phases. The experiment will reveal, how the chevron-like nanostructure of the films correlate with the observed electro-chemo-mechanical behavior.","1712":"We will study the changes in the crystal lattice of YBa2Cu3O7 caused by focused He+ ion beam, which is a common tool for nanopatterning. In the case of the macroscopic irradiated areas, the YBa2Cu3O7 undergoes a superconductor-to-insulator transition which is accompanied by the change of the crystal lattice from orthorhombic to tetragonal. However we expect that the structural phase transition might be suppressed in the case of the small (micrometer-size) irradiated area due to impossibility of the crystal lattice to accommodate strong lattice distortions.\r\nUsing a focused He+ ion beam, we will irradiate small areas of a YBa2Cu3O7 film with different ion fluences. We will scan the irradiated areas with a nanofocused X-ray beam and measure (007) and (109)\/(019) Bragg peaks to retrieve the lattice parameters in the irradiated areas. This spatially-resolved information will allow us to identify the structural changes and study the influence of ion fluence and size of the irradiated area.","1713":"In the aim of enhancing the density of components in microchips and thus improve their performances, microelectronics components keep downsizing. The \r\nInternational Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS), announced the need of sub-nanometer metrological sensitivity below the 10 nm node, usually accounting for the grid width of transistors. Current metrology technologies will reach their limits and new methods need to be explored, amongst which small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) shows great potential. It has been proven efficient for the reconstruction of several parameters such as height, side wall angle (SWA), periodicity or critical dimension (CD) on structures such as line gratings, high aspect ratio lines or deep trenches. Our study aims to apply SAXS to the measurement of overlay (OVL), which designates the misalignment between two layers in a component. In order to do so, we measure the overlay on  samples presenting stacks of line gratings with programmed overlay.","1714":"High-entropy alloy solid solutions are known to be stabilized by their large configurational entropy, contrary to intermetallic alloys. In order to verify the randomness of the atomic occupancy in the crystal structure, several techniques were employed in literature, well demonstrating that high entropy alloys show lattice distortions and short-range ordering. Short to medium range scale correlated disorder can be probed by diffuse scattering from electron, X-ray and neutrons. Transmission electron microscopy is the most widely used technique reporting diffuse scattering on these systems, often associated to short-range ordering. However, such strong statement opened a debate in the literature. Here lies the main focus of this experiment: using atomic resolution holography, we aim to correlate the X-ray and Neutron diffuse scattering observed in an Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni alloy single crystal, to nearest neighbors atomic preferences through element-selective 3D real space reconstructions. ","1715":"We have recently shown [T. Amano et al., Propagating insulator-to-metal transition in the wake of photoinduced strain waves in a Mott material, under review in Nature Physics (2023)] that the ultrafast photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) occurs in the prototypical Mott insulator V2O3 via a previously neglected mechanism involving the rapid creation of mechanical stress, followed by its relaxation through the coherent propagation of a strain wave. Yet, the link between the observed photoinduced structural \/ electronic transformations and the magnetic degrees of freedom remains unknown. Uncovering these connections is relevant to look for new pathways to instil functionality and to draw a still lacking general physical picture of ultrafast IMT\u2019s in quantum materials. In this proposal we aim to cover this gap by investigating the simultaneous development of magnetic and structural x-ray diffraction peaks, so as to fix their causal relation.","1716":"We propose to investigate the dynamics of neutron irradiated crystalline Si and vitreous SiO2 by means of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). We want to shed light on the following points: 1) X-rays and neutrons give rise or not to a similar damage effect on materials? 2) does neutron irradiated SiO2 lie in a higher location of the Potential Energy Landscape (PEL) with respect to the pristine material? 3) what is the relationship between the sample resistivity and the presence or absence of the radiolysis process? Clarification of these points is necessary to acquire a more in depth understanding of the nature of the X-ray induced dynamics as well as the beam driven transformations in crystals and glasses.","1717":"Fe5GeTe2 is a van der Waals ferromagnet and a topological material with partially occupied Fe sites. The topological state can be tuned via slowing cooling vs. quenching at 550 K, due to the disordered vs. ordered arrangement of the Fe atom. We propose to use X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy for understanding the ion dynamics across the two different cooling processes. The knowledge obtained can be used to guide new means for controlling the phase transition and the topological states in applications and devices.","1718":"We propose to investigate the atomic-scale ion transport mechanism in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) via X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) in the wide-angle X-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) regime. We will measure the mean residence times of ions (or vacancies), their jump pathways, and the associated energy barriers via temperature dependence. We anticipate that the knowledge obtained can be used for new concepts and rational improvement of fast ion conductors.","1719":"Niobium (Nb) exhibits a remarkable high thermal stability and electronic properties. Despite its multiple applications in our modern industry, large uncertainties remain on its phase diagram including its high-pressure melting temperature and solid-solid phase transitions. To better understand the structural and electronic changes in Nb at relevant P\/T conditions, we propose in this project to use time-resolved pulsed laser heating nano-XAS\/XRD studies at the new ID24-DCM and ID27 beamlines of the ESRF-EBS, which may allow overcoming previous reported experimental limitations. The yet poorly explored electronic properties of pure Nb at extreme conditions could be of critical importance for potential new applications and industrial uses.","1720":"Similar to the first-order iso-structural phase transition in elemental Ce (the gamma-alpha transition), the recently discovered polyamorphic transformations in Ce-based bulk metallic glasses are also attributed to 4f electron delocalization and the subsequent Kondo volume collapse. Despite of several experimental investigations in the past, the fundamental question of whether a critical end point exists in relation to glass polyamorphism in Ce-based metallic glasses remains unanswered. Here, we propose to address this issue by conducting X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) on a representative Ce75Al25 glass under high pressure (up to 10 GPa) and low temperature (down to 20 K). ","1721":"A very recent breakthrough in superconductivity research has led to the discovery of high temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity with a maximum of Tc of 80 K in La3Ni2O7 single crystals under high pressure. This discovery marked the first experimental evidence of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates, making La3Ni2O7 the second system after cuprates to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above the boiling point of nitrogen (except hydrates that show high-Tc at ultra-high pressures). However, many basic properties of this compound need to be systematically studied under high pressure and low temperature to understand the origin of its conductivity. Here, we propose to perform Ni K-edge XAS investigations to understand the evolution of local atomic (e.g., Ni-O, Ni-Ni interactions) and electronic properties (e.g., valence, 3d orbital configurations) of La3Ni2O7, across its superconducting transition.","1722":"We propose to study the magnetism and valence states of europium in the Zintl-type compounds EuMn2P2 and EuCuAs at high pressures up to 30 GPa by temperature and field-dependent 151Eu nuclear forward scattering at beamline ID 14 and the pressure dependence of their room temperature crystal structures at beamline ID15B up to 40 GPa. EuMn2P2 is a magnetic insulator with two magnetic elements. Surprisingly, the Mn sublattice does not develop long-range magnetic order. High-pressure transport studies indicate a transition to a metallic state above 5 GPa. In EuCuAs, the topological electronic states and properties could be tuned via the Eu spin structure, which is sensitive to magnetic fields. The proposed high-pressure synchrotron experiments, together with transport studies and electronic structure calculations, will allow us to elucidate the interplay between the covalent M-X and the ionic Eu sublattices in magnetic and topological Zintl-type europium compounds of recent interest.","1723":"The proposed experiment focuses on exploring the electronic configurations and magnetic properties of the known novel mixed-valence iron oxides (e.g. Fe5O7, Fe25O32), as well as discovering new novel iron oxides using the Synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer Source spectroscopy and Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction up to 200 GPa and 5000 K.

In this proposal, we want to measure the low energy phonon spectra associated with the single-qCDW in the twisted bilayer kagome net YCo6Ge6. We intend to comprehensively measure the temperature and momentum dependence of the low energy acoustic and optical phonons by means of high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). Our preliminary diffuse scattering data detected precursors located in the plane with odd L=1, 3, 5 that might be related to the critical role of chemical bond instability, phonon softening or the order-disorder character of the pre-translational fluctuations.","1725":"Conodonts, marine organisms from the Paleozoic to Triassic eras (495-199.6 Ma), are notable for their fossilized denticles central to their feeding. Beyond their stratigraphic use, these denticles shed light on early vertebrate evolution and exhibit intricate, naturally optimized structures. These are primarily inorganic-organic nanocomposites, with the main components being calcium carbonates, apatite, and silica. Our research focuses on the detailed analysis of these denticles to inform bio-inspired material design. Using simultaneous SAXS\/WAXS, we identified fluorapatite as the primary crystalline constituent. This exploration promises to expand our understanding of ancient skeletal architectures and drive innovations in bio-inspired material applications.","1726":"Ca2RuO4, a sister compound of the well-known unconventional superconductor Sr2RuO4, has been the subject of intense research interest due to the variety of exotic phenomena it exhibits such as current-induced non-equilibrium states, soft Higgs mode, anomalous negative thermal expansion etc. Our recent diffuse x-ray scattering experiments revealed a giant phonon softening in extended regions of the Brillouin zone, which implies large lattice anharmonicity effects that has not been previously reported in this material. Here we propose to perform non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements on single crystals of Ca2RuO4 to further investigate the phonon dynamics. We expect that our experiments will enable a deeper understanding of the lattice anharmonicity and anomalous structural properties of the system and possibly also help understand the giant lattice softening that was recently observed near the uniaxial strain induced Liftshitz transition in Sr2RuO4.","1727":"Ultra-thin films of ferroelectric doped HfO2 have unexpected ferroelectricity and unusual polarisation mechanisms; combined with their high compatibility with silicon, they have attracted a lot of attention from both fundamental research and application point of view. However, the mechanisms behind these properties remain elusive. Several unanswered questions pertain to the crystal structures of the ferroelectric phase, their transition, and the stabilisation factors. We propose to leverage the capabilities of the diffuse x-ray diffractometer at ID28 to perform in situ, high-temperature studies to unravel the complexities of these phases and their transitions, aiming to shed light on the unique ferroelectric properties of HfO2.","1728":"The origin of ferroelectricity in hafnia is thought to be an orthorhombic polar (o-) phase stabilized by doping, stress or strain, all facilitated at the nanoscale. Therefore, mostly very thin films (below 10 nm) are available in the polar state, making it extremely challenging to determine the true nature of the polar phase. We recently reported the epitaxial growth of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 on perovskite substrates under large compressive strain with large ferroelectric polarization. The films are (111) oriented and pole figures show 1:3 multiplicity indicating a rhombohedral (r-) phase. We aim to: (a) elucidate the exact structure of the (r-) phase and determine if the two reported polar phases are truly difelow ferent (b) characterise the high temperature transition recently observed in r-phase films and (c) explore the non-polar-to-polar phase transition, identifying the symmetry of the primary instability. ","1729":"The prototypical perovskite SrTiO3, while being an incipient ferroelectric in bulk, is known to possess a\r\nstructural transition at 105 K, where subtle rotations of the oxygen octahedra double the cubic unit cell\r\nresulting in a tetragonal antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase. So far, relatively little attention has been paid to\r\nthe effect of biaxial strain on the AFD transition of strained SrTiO3 thin films, and if and how it interacts\r\nwith ferroelectricity. To understand these questions, we propose to perform cryogenic diffuse scattering\r\nexperiment at ID28 on SrTiO3 films grown under different amount of biaxial strain and on substrates of\r\ndifferent symmetry. This experiment requires the capability of the ID28 beamline at ESRF to capture a large\r\nvolume of the reciprocal space and detect the very weak scattering produced by the subtle oxygen rotations\r\nin the AFD phase.","1730":"The tetragonal compounds Eu(Ga,Al)4 exhibit unusual interplay between the charge-density wave stability and applied hydrostatic pressure. Depending on the Ga and Al stoichiometry, the CDW transition can be either suppressed or induced. Recently, we managed to observe a soft-phonon mode, which precedes the CDW order in EuAl4. In the proposed experiment we intend to observe similar softening in EuGa4 under applied pressure to understand its physics.","1731":"A novel technique combining Bragg coherent diffractive imaging  with orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams to study structural chirality in Tellurium nanocrystals is proposed. Structural chirality, crucial in science, lack nanoscale study tools. This is partly due to the Friedel\u2019s problem of using symmetric beams (plane waves) to distinguish between handedness. We address this by integrating BCDI's capabilities with OAM's sensitivity to chirality, a breakthrough demonstrated in preliminary tests on Pt crystals. We aim to refine this technique through further Pt crystal experiments, then apply it to Te nanocrystals grown on chiral mica and amorphous SiO2\/Si substrates to elucidate their chiral helical structures and domains. This research promises significant insights into chiral materials, with implications for emerging technologies in electronics and quantum computing. We hope to potentially revitalizing X-ray nanoprobe with techniques with OAM beams.","1732":"Solid state electrolytes (SSEs) are a promising alternative to current Li-ion systems, with potential for significantly improved safety and energy density,\r\nbut have so far been limited by poor electrochemical stability between sulfide-based electrolytes and oxide cathodes. Recently, our collaborators discovered\r\nthat substituting Y3+ in Na3YCl6 (NYC) with Zr4+ to form a Na3-xY1-xZrxCl6 (NYZCx) SSE enhances Na+ conductivity by two orders of magnitude, while\r\nsimultaneously preventing electrochemical decomposition when paired with a NaCrO2 cathode. In a rich body of coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) research,\r\nour group has demonstrated the importance of nanoscale structure, strain and defects in the performance of cathode materials. Therefore, we propose the study\r\nof novel SSEs with Bragg CDI to investigate how the properties and dynamics of structural defects affect the ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, and cycling\r\nperformance in these systems with changes in temperature.","1733":"The goal of this study is to observe the structural evolution of single palladium nanocrystals during hydrogen absorption and desorption in rarely explored regions of the phase diagram. The Pd-H system is extremely interesting for its capability to uptake large amount of hydrogen into interstitial sites with an accompanying lattice expansion. There exist several phenomena that have not been observed in single nanocrystals such as high temperature and pressure absorption, and absorption in the supercritical phase. As well as more exotic phenomena such as spinodal decomposition that is posited to exist in small single crystals. Using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) we are able to follow in-situ the evolution of the internal and surface strain in individual nanoparticles.","1734":"The need for CO2 capture and conversion to value-added chemicals or fuels represents one of the greatest challenges for the transition to a sustainable society. Electrocatalysts play a key role in determining the product selectivity and overpotential in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2R). The use of Cu and alloyed Cu nanoparticles is a promising strategy to tune the catalytic properties. Using spectroscopic Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (spectro-BCDI), we intend to reveal both structural (lattice strain, defect(s), facets and morphology) and chemical (composition and oxidation states) characteristics of alloyed Cu catalysts under electrochemical conditions, and provide guidelines for designing both effective and selective CO2 reduction catalysts. ","1735":"During plastic deformation the motion of dislocations is intermittent giving rise to random sudden localised strain bursts, called dislocation avalanches. The aim of the proposal is to understand how and where such dislocation avalanches are triggered and to develop novel methodologies to monitor them. To this end, we propose a Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) experiment to characterise in situ the spatial structure of these avalanches and their fluctuation during micropillar compression. The experiment will be coupled with acoustic emission (AE) measurements in order to establish a quantitative relationship between dislocation avalanches and the emitted AE signals. The results are expected to shed light on the fundamentals of dislocation patterning and by deciphering the meaning of AE signals, they will have the potential to enhance the durability of engineering materials.","1736":"Metal forming involves several subsequent deformation modes. Such strain path changes lead to a dramatic change in the mechanical properties and failure, due to reorganization of the already established microstructure of dislocations. The fundamental mechanisms underlying this process have been elusive due to lack of representative data for the microstructure dynamics. \r\n In a recent experiment at ID06, the evolution of 40,000 dislocation cells were visualised. We propose to apply same methodology, but to a sample pre-deformed in an orthogonal direction. Being able to visualise the process provides unique information on how the microstructure breaks up and reassembles. Next, to understand the underlying mechanisms we will introduce a comprehensive DFXM analysis approach that simultaneously maps the elastic strain, the geometrically necessary dislocation density and the total dislocation density. All in 3D, with 200 nm resolution as function of load after the strain path change. \r\n","1737":"When annealing a polycrystal, the boundaries between the grains move. Understanding the processes involved in this \u201cgrain growth\u201d is a cornerstone of materials science and is pivotal for applications from tensile strength in structural materials to resistivity in electronic materials. The classical picture of grain growth under the curvature driving force has been challenged by recent experimental and theoretical works. It is believed that defects, which are missing in the classical picture and have not been detected experimentally, play an important role in grain growth. With the EBS upgrade and recent development of Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM), movies of the 3D grain structures and the defect-induced strain field can be mapped faster and with higher resolution. This will pave the way for a comprehensive understanding of the role of strain and defects in grain boundary migration \u2013 including a direct test of the recently developed defect-mediated grain boundary migration theory.","1738":"TiOF adopts the rutile structure on average, but exhibits local anion ordering through fac-TiO3F3 octahedra. The slightly shorter Ti-O bond results in displacements of Ti3+ cations roughly along the rutile c-axis; we have previously characterised this displacement using single crystal diffuse scattering on ID11. \r\nRecent simulations have suggested that this Ti displacement should persist to extremely high temperature; the goal of this experiment is therefore to determine whether this is the case experimentally in order to better understand how anion ordering arises in this and similar anion-ordered materials.\r\n","1739":"Novel nitrogen-based compounds are actively sought as materials for a diverse range of technological applications, including high-energy density solids and superhard materials.

The objective of this proposal is to fill this gap by elucidating the final chapters of the high-pressure nitrogen-based binary compounds narrative. This proposal builds on our previous successes on these systems, in which novel I-N compounds as well as I and Br allotropes were discovered. We now aim to investigate the Cl-N, Br-N, and I-N systems using laser-heated diamond anvil cells up to 180 GPa, significantly extending the pressure range of our previous experiments.

Here, we propose the use of high energy x-ray diffraction to obtain pair distribution function (PDF) information related to aspects of the intraparticle crystallinity along a series of cobalt-doped iron oxide MNPs. This unique structural information will allow us to address the origin of exceptionally high exchange bias properties observed in the series, emergent upon increasing Co doping. In particular, we will determine the type of defective structures generated upon Co doping. Together with preliminary information available from high resolution electron microscopy studies and details on stoichiometry, valence, and local coordination, which will be obtained by XANES and EXAFS spectroscopies, the proposed application of the synchrotron x-ray based PDF technique will allow a comprehensive study on the structure-magnetic relationship in these applications-relevant materials.","1742":"Liquid-liquid transitions (LLTs) are a fascinating process where one liquid transforms into another via a first-order transition. In metallic liquids, this usually occurs in the ultra-viscous supercooled state and is accompanied by an abnormal exothermic calorimetry signal and important structural changes at the medium and short range order. Here, we propose an innovative approach which combines XRD and sensor-based flash nanocalorimetry to in-situ initiate and capture the whole process accompanying the LLT of Pd-Ni-P glass formers. By isolating the LLT from crystallization using rapid heating\/cooling rates, we can directly connect its kinetics, reversibility, and first-order nature by combining the thermal response with the structural changes occurring at the different relevant length scales.","1743":"The main objective of this proposal is to study the structural evolution of rare-earth chromites RCrO3 (R = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Lu) from 4 K to 1073 K.

Moreover, a higher temperature (T >30 K) dielectric relaxor behavior is also observed . The present system belongs to trigonal structure with crystal symmetry P-31c (300 K), which is centrosymmetric in nature. Hence, a crucial step is to investigate the low-temperature crystal structure via synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), particularly below TN2, to elucidate the development of ferroelectric order.","1748":"Our research is mainly devoted to studying the interplay between gas sorption and the local and global dynamics in Metal-Organic Frameworks. We developed a novel class of MOFs endowed with ultra-fast molecular rotors, which display negligible activation energy for rotational motion with energy barrier as low as 6 - 20 cal\/mol. We explored the modulation of their rotational dynamics by guests species, that can be effectively applied to drive a dramatic response of the dynamic properties in the solid state. Recently, we have investigated how the local rotary dynamics can be intrinsically coupled to the global framework flexibility induced by different chemical stimuli.

In contrast to the doped semiconducting AgCrSe2, Cr3Se4 is intrinsically metallic and shows at least two magnetic phase transitions at a considerably higher energy scale.  Our thermodynamic measurements suggest a strong coupling of the magnetic and the lattice degrees of freedom. Because of the strong dependence of the transport properties on the specific symmetry and details of the lattice we suggest an accurate characterisation of the crystal structure depending on temperature down well below the observed magnetic transition temperatures.","1751":"It is planned to perform in-situ during x-ray diffraction during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of metallic glasses (Zr-based) using a mini LPBF device with new laser optical system that allows to better control the energy input in order to achieve highly optimized conditions to better control the reheating of the material. As metallic glasses are very sensitive to the reheating conditions they are a perfect probe material to test this new technology and new understanding regarding the structure formation are expected.","1752":"Epitaxial SrIrO3 and CaIrO3 thin films on STO(001) substrates crystallize in the perovskite structure and both display paramagnetic and semimetallic behavior. We successfully synthesized epitaxially strained thin films of the substitution series CaxSr1-xIrO3. A non-monotonic evolution of the out-of-plane lattice parameter is found, which for low x increases with respect to that for pure SrIrO3. Interestingly, this strained state for x>0.1 is accompanied by the occurrence of an anomalous Hall effect contribution below 50 K, which suggests the emergence of ferromagnetism. However, the ferromagnetic signal could not yet be confirmed by bulk magnetization measurements probably due to the small magnetic moment of the Iridium atoms. We propose XMCD measurements to investigate the Ir ferromagnetism and characterize the strain-induced phase in CaxSr1-xIrO3 for few selected concentrations x.","1753":"We propose to study the mechanism of the first-order magnetic phase transitions (FOMT) of Nd2In and Pr2In. Unlike typical first-order magnetocaloric (MC) materials that exhibit significant thermal hysteresis, these two compounds show anhysteretic FOMT with a giant magnetocaloric effect. Although both experimental and theoretical investigations on R2In (R: Nd, Pr) indicate a strong interrelation between crystal structure, electronic band structure, and magnetic sublattice, the mechanism of FOMT in R2In is yet to be understood. Recently, we have developed a unique setup at ID12 of ESRF to measure simultaneously macroscopic physical properties (magnetization, magnetostriction, magnetocaloric, resistivity) and element specific atomistic behaviour (XAS\/XMCD). Using such device, we will be able to correlate both atomistic and macroscopic measurements of the FOMTs of Pr2In and Nd2In. These results will promote fundamental understanding of the FOMTs in R2In (R: rare-earth elements).","1754":"Recently, an unusual sequence of four topological states has been observed in multiferroic GdMn2O5. In these experiments, in ramping the external magnetic\r\nfield up and down through the magnetic phase transition, the electric polarization of the sample passes through a cycle of four states, schematically represented\r\nas 1=>2=>3=>4=>1. In these experiments, the clockwise or counterclockwise sequence of states is protected by the geometry of the experiment, making them\r\nequivalent to a topological charge. A theoretical explanation of the observed effects suggests that half of the spins rotate by 360 degree with 90 degree in each\r\nstep. The goal of this proposal is to observe the full-angle spin rotation with the field-induced XMCD.","1755":"This proposal aims to study the microscopic stabilization mechanism of different charge density wave stacking schemes in the layered material 1T-TaS2.  This material has a  complex electronic phase diagram as a function of pressure and temperature which exhibits various CDW phases along with pressure induced superconductivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments have shown that not only the in-plane CDW order changes as a function of pressure and temperature, but also the stacking order of the CDW in the out-of-plane direction is affected. DFT simulations have identified S-3pz derived bounding states as central players in stabilizing the different stacking schemes in this material. However, direct experimental evidence for such a mechanism is yet to be found. Therefore, we propose to use the newly created possibilities at ID12 to study the behaviour of exactly these S-3pz states as a function of pressure and temperature by means of Xray-absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES).","1756":"Though predicted in the 1960s, Magneto Chiral Dichroism (M\uf063D) has been observed several decades latter and almost exclusively in the UV-visible range. Some of us recently published a validation of the microscopic theory behind magnetochiral dichroism in the UV-visible range, based on experimental observations on chiral [M(en)3](NO3)2 coordination complexes. We propose here to pursue this study in the X-ray range, in order to detect the exceedingly rare X-ray Magneto Chiral Dichroism (XMChiD). \r\n\tFollowing a series of papers where we have been measuring the interaction of X-rays with chiral crystals, we aim at measuring the X-ray Magneto Chiral Dichroism (XMChiD) at the Co K-edge. From our previous extensive measurements of X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism (XNCD) we have selected the [Co(en)3](NO3)2 crystal for which we expect that a \"large\" XMChiD signal should be observed and we plan to record the angular dependence of XMChiD that up to now has never been measured.\r\n","1757":"This project addresses interfacial effects of spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnet\/heavy metal bilayers and aims at their optimization using various spin sink materials and designing an inteface via strain and alloying. In the previous set of samples probed by FMR, XMCD and TEM we have shown the absence of magnetic polarization of Rh in epitaxial Fe\/Rh bilayers grown on GaAs(001) which are characterized by excellent epitaxial quality and minimized strain via regular disclocations plane at the atomically flat interface. In this follow-up proposal we aim to reveal the role of induced magnetic polarization of strained Rh layer in interfacial spin transport (damping enhancement due to spin pumping, interfacial transparency) in Fe\/Rh bilayers grown on GaAs(110) substrate which is known to promote Volmer-Weber growth of Fe (nucleation of 3D islands due to large interface energy and the following quasi-layer-by-layer growth) with increased surface roughness.","1758":"Following a recent investigation carried out at ID12, the measurement of magnetic susceptibility using XMCD at the U M4 and M5 edges yielded an observation of enhanced paramagnetism and lack of magnetic order in UO2 thin films (< 21nm) epitaxially grown on a series of perovskite substrates.\r\nFirstly, it is of interest to investigate if the enhancement of susceptibility at low-T is a function of film thickness. Additionally, it would be beneficial to gather data to determine the finite size effects and ultimately the critical thickness of AFM order in UO2 films. Both can be measured with XMCD at ID12. \r\nSamples for this experiment will be grown on the LSAT ((La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3) perovskite substrate as this yielded UO2 samples with excellent crystalline quality.   \r\n  ","1759":"Charge density waves (CDW) and fluctuations (CDF), are diffusively present in cuprate high-Tc superconductors (HTS) and experimental evidence points toward their influence in determining the unconventional transport properties of this class of materials. However, one of the greatest challenges to study charge order in HTS is given by their complex intertwining with the superconducting order below Tc. To overcome this problem, we propose here the very first RIXS study of CDW and CDF in Zn-doped YBCO samples, where superconductivity is suppressed by the Zn atoms partly substituting Cu atoms. Our measurements will enable to track the evolution of CDW and CDF in a range of temperatures where usually superconductivity modifies the charge order properties. Ultimately, we expect to determine if CDF follow a critical behaviour towards zero temperature, i.e., to understand if they are indeed connected to a strange metal quantum critical point and, in case, if this criticality is anomalous.","1760":"Our recent investigation of LaNiO3\/LaTiO3 superlattices using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and muon spin rotation (uSR) has revealed the emergence of a novel interfacial quasi-2D magnetic order. However, the microscopic details of this magnetic order, such as its type (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) and orientation are still unknown. Its magnetic transition temperature of 18 K measured by uSR is also very low compared to its high magnon energy of ~100 meV measured by RIXS (corresponding to a theoretical transition temperature of >1000 K). Here, we propose to do a systematic study of this LaNiO3\/ LaTiO3 using x-ray magnetic linear and circular dichroism spectroscopies (XMLD and XMCD) to determine the type and orientation of its interfacial magnetic order and verify its magnetic transition temperature.","1761":"Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting strong time\u2010reversal symmetry\u2010breaking responses, akin to ferromagnets, alongside a fully compensated magnetization typical of collinear antiferromagnets (AFM). Altermagnets are predicted to be ideal platforms for THz spintronic devices due to their tunable chiral spin waves and robustness to stray magnetic fields. First principle calculations suggest that \u03b1\u2010MnTe (A\u2010type AFM order below TN = 310 K with the easy axis along the (210) direction) is an altermagnetic compound with a chiral split magnon spectrum with linear dispersion near the zone center. However, experimental evidence of an unconventional magnon spectrum is lacking. We propose to perform a circularly polarized momentum\u2010resolved Resonant Inelastic X\u2010ray Scattering at the L3 Mn edge below Tn to reveal the time\u2010reversal symmetry\u2010breaking nature of the low energy magnetic excitations in \u03b1\u2010MnTe.","1762":"Magnetism in materials has known two faces: ferromagnets (FM) and anti-ferromagnets (AFM). Recent theoretical proposals have brought into play a third flavour called altermagnetism. This version of magnetic order expresses characteristics of FM and AFM simultaneously by lifting spin degeneracies whilst exhibiting net zero magnetization. Yet, a clear-cut experimental fingerprint reflected in the excited state spectrum awaits detection. Here, we propose to use circular-dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS) to probe the unique spectroscopic signatures of an altermagnetic candidate material. The interference of FM and AFM properties giving rise to this novel magnetic state should be well mirrored in the orbital and magnetic excitations. By momentum-mapping these excitations using CD-RIXS, we aim to provide unambiguous evidence for altermagnetism and pave the way to a systematic approach for the investigation of a wide range of candidate materials.","1763":"The nature and origin of charge order in high-temperature superconducting cuprates are still open questions. Recent measurements suggest that the long-range charge ordered phase emerges out of a broader regime characterized by short-range, and possibly dynamical, correlations. However, it remains unresolved whether the emergence develops through a quantum critical point or through a smooth crossover. As resonant soft x-ray scattering techniques have proved to be one of the most sensitive techniques to probe charge correlations in cuprates, here we propose to study charge order around optimal doping with the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) technique. We plan to add another dimension to the cuprate phase diagram by combining RIXS with application of magnetic field. It enables us to clarify whether the long-range charge order can be field induced, which would support or stay in opposition to the quantum critical point scenario.","1764":"Multiferroic materials are of significant interest for spintronic and electronic applications. Of such materials, e-Fe2O3 is interesting because it is a hard ferrimagnet that exhibits strong magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Because the electronic structure has yet to be resolved, the origin of the multiferroicity is unclear. Here we will use the RIXS-MCD spectrometer at ID-32 to investigate the d-d excitations of e-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in both the low temperature incommensurate and room temperature ferrimagnetic (multiferroic) magnetic phases. Cr-doped samples (with missing eg orbital electrons) will provide further information about the role of the eg orbitals. This experiment will provide an improved understanding of the physics that underpin multiferroic perovskites.","1765":"The role of spin excitations in the formation of Cooper pairs in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is still controversial. Our recent RIXS measurements at the ESRF reported anomalies in the magnon peak shape for YBCO thin films cut along the (103) crystal surface compared to c-axis oriented films. At present, it is unclear whether the shape of the magnon is actually anomalous or a different kind of excitation adds up in the same energy range. The goal of the present proposal is an extensive investigation of the magnon dispersion by means of combined energy, momentum and polarization analysis, in order to test the hypothesis that these effects are caused by the spin confinement along one in-plane direction.","1766":"First principle calculations predict the formation of a 2D-electron gas (2DEG) at the (001) interface between SrO-terminated SrTiO3 and  ferroelectric (FE) KNN, which has the peculiar property to be on\/off switchable by the direction of the KNN FE-polarization. This is very promising in view of non-volatile electronic applications. Recently we were able to realize such 2DEG by a epitaxial engeneering.\r\nWe propose total electron yield x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray linear dichroism at the Ti L3,2 and Nb M3,2 -edges to establish the oxidation state and the crystal-field splitting of the Ferroelectric\/insulator 2DEG formed at the KNN\/STO interface. The results will provide crucial details concerning the electronic properties of the system, including the crystal field splitting and valence of Nb-4d and Ti-3d states, the latter possibly giving clues about the filling of Nb-related and Ti-related bands contributing to the 2DEG.\r\n","1767":"The driving mechanism of the first-order isostructural gamma\u2013alpha phase transition of face-center-cubic cerium remains controversial until today. In this project, we propose to measure high resolution Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) of the Ce0.93Sc0.07 alloy at the Ce M5-edge (3d-4f edge) to experimentally resolve for the first time the Kondo gap and its spin-orbit replicate in the low-energy excitations of Ce metal to follow its evolution across the gamma\u2013alpha first-order isostructural phase transition. The spectra will be analyzed by comparing them with Anderson impurity model calculations to estimate the hybridization strength in each phase and clarify the driving mechanism of the gamma\u2013alpha phase transition in cerium.","1768":"The captivating realm of nickelates, characterized by the multiple oxidation states of nickel, has been a subject of intense interest. A breadth of fascinating materials has been uncovered, including superconducting infinite-layer nickelates, and the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper La3Ni2O7 superconductor under pressure. Recently, pressure-induced bulk superconductivity has been observed in trilayer La4Ni3O10. In contrast to the weak magnetism in La3Ni2O7, La4Ni3O10 exhibits a strong magnetic order at ambient pressure. External pressure suppresses this magnetic order and induces superconductivity at 30 K. These results suggest an unconventional superconducting mechanism in which magnetism may play an important role. We propose to perform Ni L-edge RIXS on single-crystalline La4Ni3O10 to study the spin excitations and determine the effective exchange couplings. This information is crucial to understanding the magnetism and its relationship with superconductivity in nickelates.","1769":"With weak interlayer coupling, van der Waals materials offer unique opportunities to utilize magnetism at the 2-D limit. Fe3GaTe2 has emerged as an attractive candidate for intrinsic ferromagnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials, exhibiting robust magnetism exceeding room temperature and showcasing high potential for applications in spintronics. The discovery of a significant two-dimensional (2-D) skyrmion topological Hall effect (THE), boasting an exceptionally wide temperature range encompassing room temperature, underscores the remarkable potential inherent in this material. We propose employing magnetic circular dichroic Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS-MCD) at the Fe L3 edge on the ID-32 beamline to probe the ferromagnetic low-energy excitations in Fe3GaTe2. This approach holds the potential to provide invaluable insights into the contributions of spin and orbital degrees of freedom to 2-D magnetism and the magnetic Hamiltonian.","1770":"Hematite photoanodes are widely studied because they could offer low-cost and sustainable photoelectrodes for oxygen evolution reaction. Doping has been demonstrated an effective way to improve the photoelectrochemical properties. In particular, normally Sn is introduced into the hematite films deposited or grown on FTO (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide) by high-temperature diffusion of Sn from the substrate. When used as photoanode, the photocurrent increases when the Sn doping iincreases from 0 to 3 at%, and then saturates (12% behaves as the 3%). Sn-doping sligtly modify the hematite lattice.We ask for a XAS investigation at Fe and Sn K-edge to measure the Fe and Sn site in hematite nanostructured films as a function of the Sn concentration and of the annealing temperature, with the aim to correlate the Sn site with the photoelectrochemical properties.","1771":"Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials are unusual substances that shrink when heated and expand when cooled, garnering considerable attention due to their potential applications. Recently, Cu2P2O7 has garnered recognition for its excellent NTE performance (\u03b1v ~ -26.5\u00d710-6 K-1 from 5 to 373 K) and facile synthesis. Interestingly, the NTE temperature range of this material can be expanded by substituting P with V, particularly with a P substitution value of 0.5. Therefore, starting with Cu2P0.5V1.5O7, we discovered that substituting Mn for Cu resulted in a structural phase transition in the Cu2-xMnxP0.5V1.5O7 system (x<=0.2), leading to extraordinary NTE properties: during the phase transition, the maximum volume reduction reached -1.6%, marking the most significant shrinkage recorded within the same temperature range to date. By employing EXAFS spectroscopy, we expect to gain a better understanding of the mechanism underlying this exceptional contraction.","1772":"With the proposed experiment, we aim to analyze the specific structural changes occurring at a local level when chalcogenide glasses are exposed to photon beams. We intend to quantify and compare the impact of photons with energies around the bandgap (~eV) of the glass and those within the hard X-ray spectrum. The EXAFS spectra will enable us to examine the athermal local atomic rearrangements induced by photons of varying energies and polarizations. Our objective is to enhance our understanding of the microscopic mechanisms underlying the photo-induced phenomena observed in this family of glasses.","1773":"Our goal is to probe the densification transition, local structure mechanisms, and electronic evolution of both amorphous WO3 and crystalline 7-coordinated \u201cmetallic\u201d WO3, using XAS under high-pressure conditions. Amorphous (a) and crystalline (c) WO3 present distinct electronic properties, which are mainly concerned to the formation of localized electronic states, contingent upon the crystallinity degree. The significance of this fact for industrial applications is profound, as the level of crystallinity enables precise adjustment of their properties. The crystalline WO3 has several polymorphic phases reported under pressure; however, none is known on possible amorphous-amorphous transitions in a-WO3. Densification accompanied by an increase in CN from 6 to 7 is anticipated to occur in a-WO3, since it was described for its crystalline counterpart. The proposed experiment will shed light on the average coordination numbers and packing efficiencies in compressed WO3.","1774":"We have studied the variable-temperature (VT) structure in NaNiO2, a Jahn-Teller (JT) distorted battery cathode material with a triangular lattice, and uncovered a new and unusual phenomenon: the local JT distortion is suppressed at the same temperature as the cooperative JT (cJT) distortion in a displacive transition. This contrasts with the widely-studied perovskites, where JT distortions persist locally even when the cJT distortion disappears (an order-disorder transition). Displacive JT transitions are unreported and must be explored further.\r\nTo investigate this under a different set of conditions, we performed variable-pressure (VP) diffraction on NaNiO2 and found that the cJT effect disappears at a symmetry-increasing transition above ~22 GPa. If the VT phenomenon is due to the triangular lattice, then the VP transition should coincide with a local JT vanishing, by analogy with the VT transition. To test this, we propose to study the Ni environment in NaNiO2 using VP-EXAFS. \r\n","1775":"Cation ordering at A or B sites of the ABO3 perovskite structure gives AA\u2019B2O6 or A2BB\u2019O6 double perovskites (DPvs) and 1:1 cation ordering at both sites can\r\ngive AA\u2019BB\u2019O6 double double perovskites (DDPvs). During our high\u2013P,T (HPHT) synthesis studies of Mn-based DPvs and DDPvs, we discovered an anomalous\r\nresult \u2013 that CaMnMnTeO6 gave only a DPv (Ca0.5Mn0.5)2MnTeO6 structure whereas CaMnMnReO6 (where Re is slightly smaller than Te) and CaMnMnWO6\r\n(where W is slightly larger than Te) both gave DDPvs. We hypothesise that significant formation of Te4+ occurs as an intermediate under HPHT synthesis conditions - Te4+ is\r\nunusually large due to lone pair effects and so could favour the DPv structure. In situ XRD experiments on ID06-LVP are requested to observe the structure under\r\nHPHT synthesis conditions to test this hypothesis and to discover whether DDPv or intermediate structures are formed during synthesis.","1776":"The BO3, B=C, N, Cl, ... systems all demonstrate aragonite and (where described) postaragonite structure types. The structural sequences exhibited by these different chemistries; however, differs in the detail: several intermediate forms and a host of metastable intermediates are identified. We wish to investigate their origin and rationalise their occurrence to give a better generalised view of the aragonite-postaragonite region of p, T structure-space.","1777":"This research proposal is dedicated to exploring the structural properties of Eu\u2013Zn\u2013As Zintl Pnictides (ZPs) under high-pressure (HP) conditions.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies under hydrostatic pressure will help us to provide insight into tunability mechanism within Zintl polyanionic frameworks of different dimensionalities under hydrostatic pressures. Followed by the physical property measurements, we aim to establish structure-property relationships necessary for designing novel quantum materials.

The goal of this proposal is to study the formation and the metastability of such phases in the pores of zeolites at high pressures and low temperatures by following the pore and unit cell volumes of the zeolites precisely as functions of pressure and temperature by x-ray diffraction. In this way, the metastability of the swelled, H2 filled states at low temperature can be determined, which could have implications for hydrogen storage applications.","1779":"With the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bcc-H3S with the critical temperature of Tc = 203 K at 150 GPa the search for novel\r\nsuperconducting hydrides became the most active topic in the field of high-pressure research.

From neutron diffraction data, it was shown that Li+ ions occupy interstitial void positions within the ice VII lattice, whilst the Cl- ions substitutionally take the place of the water molecules. This gives rise to remarkable changes in properties of the ice VII structure such as an expanded lattice volume, orientational disorder, high ionic conductivity and suppression of phase transition to proton ordered phases, which could have strong consequences on the modelling of the interiors of icy planets. However, the structure and phase diagram of the more astrophysically relevant NaCl-filled ice has not yet been explored. In this proposal, we aim to study the structure and phase diagram of NaCl-filled ice VII under the p-T conditions relevant for the interior of icy bodies in our Solar system.

Given the high pressures required to form these compounds, research into lower-pressure stable analogs of these compounds is vital. Due to its increased atomic radius, incorporating Se into H3S provides a straightforward route to reducing the pressure in which these compounds become stable. We therefore propose to characterise the structural properties of the S-Se-H system.\r\n","1782":"Gas hydrates have received considerable attention in the last decades due to their extensive natural occurrence on Earth and extraterrestrial bodies, and to their significant applications in sustainable technologies.  In particular, hydrogen hydrates offer carbon-free high energy content per unit mass (~14 MJ\u00b7kg-1). They are promising functional materials for clean energy storage and offer alternative to the current cryo-compressed hydrogen storage technology, insuring low production and operational costs, environmentally benign nature, and lower risk of flammability.

The common denominator is a charge density wave (CDW) that reconstructs the Fermi surface and determines an equilibrium of magnetic nesting instabilities. For a global explanation of this electronic-magnetic phase diagram, we propose to characterize the pressure dependence of CDWs in these materials, using high-energy x-ray diffraction from membrane-driven diamond anvil cells.

We have observed a new Al-N phase in our preliminary experiments with high-pressure laser heating (LH) experiments.

Recently, it has been suggested that the electrical heating experiments, on which most state-of-the art electrical conductivity tables are built, may contain a systematic error due to the electrothermal instability (ETI). ETI develops in all current heated metals and leads to a thermal non-uniformity which may bias conductivity measurements.

On one hand, we will perform second-time scale XRD diffraction during  few minute-time scale  rapid compression ramp  on pure LiH. On the other hand, we will load a \u00b5m size single crystal LiH in Ne pressure transmitting medium and will perform single crystal X-ray diffraction in a toroidal DAC to extend accurately the determination of the EoS of LiH in the 400 GPa range. A significant output would be the observation of the B1-B2 transition. \r\n\r\n","1793":"We aim to investigate potential new phases of hydrogen-rich compounds in the Hf-H, Sc-H, and Lu-H binary systems, focusing on those with promising high critical temperatures of superconductivity under high pressures ranging from 200 to 400 GPa. Samples will be prepared using diamond anvil cells, with appropriate leads deposited for subsequent four-probe electrical transport measurements.","1794":"This proposal aims at studying the liquid phase of As4S4 (realgar) in order to determine whether a first-order liquid-liquid transition (LLT) exists between a molecular and a polymeric liquid under high P-T conditions. Such examples of first-order transition in the liquid state remain scarce, and this phenomena is poorly understood. Previous experimental and theoretical studies of the AsS melt suggest that a LLT exists in this system but a firm experimental proof is lacking. Here, using the state-of-the-art facilities of ID27, we will perform the first direct experimental density measurements combined with x-ray diffraction (XRD) to establish and characterize the LLT in AsS.","1795":"The physics of ejecta is of direct scientific interest to fields like planetary impact and shock-related works where ejecta can disrupt measurements, damage equipment, or even present safety hazards. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, the influence of geometry and edge effects on the ejection\r\nphenomena are still poorly known. We recently demonstrated that X-ray radiography is particularly well suited for such studies, through preliminary experiments performed in the frame of the shock BAG that gave outstanding results. The goal of the present proposal is to push further these studies, by combining time resolved radiography measurements coupled with velocimetry and mass measurements in various configurations highlighting the influence of geometry and edge effects.","1796":"In materials chemistry, there is currently intense debate on the nature of non-classical phases that form as precursors to crystalline materials: are they true thermodynamic phases or simply mixing heterogeneities? To date, neither case has been demonstrated conclusively. The goal of this proposal is to use cryogenic near-field ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (3DNFP) to obtain quantitative information from these elusive phases and settle the debate. Aqueous solutions of cerium oxalate undergoing non-classical crystallization will be cryo-quenched at multiple reaction times to determine the size, volume fraction, and density of transient phases over time to assess their thermodynamic\/ kinetic nature. We also address the panel\u2019s comments from the previous call and emphasize that the preparation of samples on 2D TEM grids is a routine method in our lab with no risk of ice formation and that the previous beamtime showed no risk of radiation damage.","1797":"The 1T-TiSe2 system displays unique quantum phenomena such as charge density wave (CDW), excitonic insulating (EI) state instabilities and superconductivity. Recently, phase separation in the electronic structure of Cu-intercalated TiSe2 was found below the CDW transition temperature (~200 K). Here, we propose to study the domain dependent local structure of CuxTiSe2 through space-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize these different phases for their valence electronic states as a function of Cu intercalation. The plan is to study single crystal samples with different fractions of Cu, yielding different CDW patterns, in order to obtain comprehensive information on the phase separation and characteristics of the individual phases in these materials. With the proposed approach we expect to derive a quantitative correlation between the electronic structure, CDW, EI state and superconductivity in 1T-TiSe2.","1798":"Our research focuses on the biological design principles of nemertean worm Amphiporus lactifloreus, specifically its stylet\u2014a vital tool for prey capture. The primary stylet, measuring 100 \u00b5m in length, is composed of stable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), a precursor phase that in other organisms is transient and transforms into crystalline calcium phosphate phases like hydroxyapatite, found in human bones and teeth. We employ synchrotron experiments with nanometre resolution (ID13-WAXS+SAXS, ID21-\u00b5-XANES) to investigate the ACP phase's structure, potential amorphous phases, and stabilization mechanisms. Preliminary lab results, using nano-CT and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, show notable differences in contrast and elemental distributions. This knowledge is crucial for synthesizing ACP and ACP-based materials with applications in hard tissue engineering, such as bone and teeth repair. ","1799":"Up to now, it is challenging to precisely regulate the mechanical properties and understand the deformation mechanisms of metallic glasses (MGs) at the atomic scale, severely limiting their mechanical applications. Here, we intend to manufacture clamped cantilevers through focused ion beam milling using samples of the Pd-Ni-P MGs, which have undergone varying degrees of liquid-liquid transition (LLT) and are expected to manifest distinct atomic structures and mechanical properties. By loading the cantilever to stress levels on the order of mN and employing in-situ cross-sectional nano X-ray diffraction (XRD) to track the local strains and initiated shear bands, we can directly establish the correlation between the local atomic structures and deformation mechanisms in different samples.","1800":"The liquid-liquid transition (LLT) is a captivating process where one liquid transforms into another via a first-order transition. Ionic liquids (IL) are a class of systems with excellent glass-forming ability. In recent years, some studies have successively reported LLT in ionic liquids, providing evidence based on thermodynamics, kinetics, and structure. Here, we intend to simultaneously employ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) to characterize the structural evolution of LLT in ILs. Our emphasis will be on investigating the effect of the liquid cooling rate on the LLT dynamics.","1801":"The project aims to investigate ultrafast phase changes in application relevant lead-free ferroelectric phase change materials (PCM). Devices based on well-known PCM, such as chalcogenides, show characteristic switching times in the order of hundreds of ns. The project will focus on the physics of ultrafast optically induced phase transitions on the picosecond time scale in ferroelectric thin films of KTN (= K(Nb1-xTax)O3). The idea is to optically induce a phase transition into a stable or meta-stable intermediate state and investigate the dynamics and characteristic switching time between structural phases with different crystal symmetries.","1802":"The possibility of using light to control complex systems on ultra-short timescales provides a powerful tool to probe fundamental phenomena in solid state physics and is promising for future applications. In this proposal we aim at studying the light-induced strain fields in ferroelectric\/ferroelastic GeTe thin films with sub-nanosecond time resolution. In order to study the photostrictive properties of GeTe thin film and the temporal dynamics we plan to carry out time-resolved x-ray diffraction and measure symmetric and asymmetric Bragg peaks. By analysing the dynamics of shear and longitudinal strain components we will address the contribution of thermal and non-thermal processes resulting from the photoexcitation of charge carriers in GeTe.","1803":"Glasses are off-equilibrium materials that slowly relax towards their meta-stable equilibrium state, which is referred to as physical aging. Physical aging is known to be a highly non-linear process with regard to temperature history. The physical origin of this non-linearity has been proposed decades ago within the famous material time concept. Recently, this conjecture has been confirmed by some of the authors for an aging molecular glass, by the first-time experimental determination of the material time, which was then shown to, e.g., linearize the change of the material's dielectric properties during aging. The proposal aims to extend the material time concept to metallic glasses, by XPCS experiments. Moreover, simultaneous structural characterizations offer the unique opportunity of verifying whether the material time, determined from dynamical properties of the material, does linearize the change of the material's structure during aging.","1804":"In this experiment, we will study the clean (0001) and (10-14) surface structures of ilmenite (FeTiO3) and the water adsorption on these surfaces using surface X-ray diffraction. By measuring crystal truncation rods (CTRs) under ultra-high vacuum conditions, we will be able to determine the near-surface structure and water adsorption-induced structural changes which are relevant for materials processing technologies and solar water splitting.","1805":"We aim to use slow temperature scanning XPCS to study the sub-Tg relaxations, aging effects, and the (de-)vitrification behavior of two archetypical metallic glass formers. A novel fitting approach recently developed by our groups will help to separate different decorrelation mechanisms, further allowing to identify and separate different underlying types of atomic motions. To do so, the fast acquisition time and excellent signal-to-noise ratio available at the fourth generation synchrotron ESRF are substantially needed.","1806":"1T-TaS2 is a van der Waals transition metal dichalcogenide material with unique \u2018Star of David\u2019 charge density wave (CDW) states at thermal equilibrium. Numerous studies have characterized the various CDW phases in 1T-TaS2 through observables such as resistivity, optical reflectivity, and scanning tunnelling microscopy, but experiments to study the recently discovered \u2018hidden\u2019 metastable CDW state have been less revealing. In particular, the temperature-dependent switching probability and the lifetime of the hidden phase lacks a fundamental explanation. Therefore, we propose to use x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to directly measure equilibrium dynamics of the commensurate CDW phase to investigate the electronic environment favorable in opening the nonequilibrium pathway to the hidden phase. We aim to find the critical temperature and the corresponding dynamic environment within the commesurate phase that allows for the onset of the hidden phase.","1807":"The Invar effect, characteristic to Fe65Ni35 ordered fcc solid solution, was observed also in the case of ferromagnetic bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). While its origin\r\nis still a matter of debate, existing explanations for crystalline materials are built on the fcc lattice. However, this approach cannot be used to describe the Invar\r\neffect observed in BMGs, because they lack the crystalline structure.\r\nThere are two types of Invar effects in BMGs. They are distinguished macroscopically by the range over which the magnetic interactions reduce the CTE but there\r\nis no understanding about the underlying physics. By studying the disordered atomic arrangements at multiple absorption edges the structure can be modeled.\r\nThe proposed experiment will put into evidence which atomic arrangements drive the anomalous thermal expansion and improve on the understanding of magnetic\r\nphenomena in amorphous materials.","1808":"Experimental data regarding the relationship between density and temperature and the local structural changes in the ion hydration environment in diluted aqueous solutions has long been desired. Such an information is essential for understanding possible transformations between octahedral and more complex hydration configurations occurring in the liquid and in salty ice phases. We propose to investigate the local structural changes in aqueous solutions of representative 3d metal elements (Fe and Cu) up to 15 GPa and 1000 K, using EXAFS refinement. We aim to obtain reliable quantitative data that is necessary for further understanding about the salt-water phase diagrams including the eutectic melting point depression as a function of pressure. The proposed research will have strong interdisciplinary implications on the understanding of fundamental processes which involve salty water under extreme conditions in astrophysics and applied geophysics. ","1809":"The aim of the proposal is to carry out pair distribution function (PDF), XANES and EXAFS analyses on Mn-doped halide double perovskites (HDPs), in form of bulk and nanocrystals, characterised by persistent luminescent (PeL). Remarkably, PeL disappears at room temperature (RT) moving from bulk to nano-structured samples in Mn2+doped Cs2(Na1-xAgx)InCl6 compounds. The origin of this behaviour has not yet been explained and our proposal aims to shed light on this phenomenon. The PeL is due to traps, that could be local structure defects. So, an in-depth characterization of the local structural properties by EXAFS and PDF is required to reveal how the structural defects change from bulk to nano, impacting PeL. Moreover, given that PeL is influenced by temperature, XAS could give us meaningful information at low and high temperature. Adding this info to our existing knowledge will enable us to achieve PeL in nano halide perovskites, with greater applicability.","1810":"Recent theory and experimental investigations reveal the presence of a new magnetic phase called altermagnets. Altermagnets possess features that are normal characteristics of either antiferromagnets or ferromagnets and retain fascinating properties like high even-parity wave magnetism, generally associated with unconventional superconductivity. Within this proposal, we want to investigate the predicted altermagnetic phase in \u03b1-Fe2O3 utilising nuclear forward scattering. We expect that by our experimental protocol, we will have a spectroscopic tool to investigate altermagnetic materials with M\u00f6ssbauer active isotopes. In addition, investigating high even-parity wave magnetism might help further understand the connection between unconventional superconductivity and magnetism.","1811":"We will exploit the unique capabilities of the NRAIXS spectrometer with high energy resolution (0.1 meV) at ID14 to probe the density of vibrational states (DOS) of a thin film of pure Ta2O5. We expect the DOS to show a significant temperature dependence at frequencies below 300 GHz (~ 1.2 meV), based on numerical simulations [1]. A proper description of the temperature and frequency dependence of the DOS above the Debye level will allow us to disentangle the harmonic and an-harmonic contributions. Our goal is to connect the high (GHz) and low (kHz) frequency regimes with the aim of elucidating the frequency dependence of the secondary relaxation processes in amorphous thin films.","1812":"Glass materials exhibit vibrational anomalies, including the \"boson peak\" (BP), characterized by an abundance of low-frequency vibrational modes beyond the expectation in the Debye model. The BP is often described to correlate with disorder and density, but usually these two parameters increase when going from the crystalline to the glassy state. However, the metal- organic framework (MOF) glasses, a glass family discovered in 2015, offer a unique opportunity to study the BP as the MOF glasses usually feature a higher density than their isochemical crystals \u2013 in stark contrast to the vast majority of other glass families. Therefore, we here propose to collect inelastic X-ray scattering data to deduce the vibrational density of states of two MOF crystals (ZIF-4 and ZIF-zni with densities of 1.49 and 1.60 g cm-3, respectively) and their isochemical glass (density of 1.63 g cm-3) with the ultimately aim decouple the effect of density and disorder on the BP.","1813":"In previous experiments on x-ray parametric down-conversion (XPDC), we successfully resolved the splitting into highly asymmetric (i.e., x-ray and EUV) photon pairs. We observed remarkable scattering features that revealed the hybridization of this EUV photon with matter, thus forming an EUV polariton. In this way, XPDC provides a rare and novel insight into strong light-matter coupling in the EUV regime. Here, we aim to extend this capability to the class of \u2018exciton polaritons\u2019: Exploring XPDC for the first time near a core-shell resonance, we expect the down-converted EUV photon to hybridize strongly with this electronic resonance. We propose to use lithium triborate (LBO), which is known for its high optical nonlinearity, while also exhibiting two promising exciton resonances (i.e., before the K-edge of Boron and Lithium). We aim to observe EUV exciton polaritons at both resonances, obtaining unprecedented insights into their formation, life-time and electronic structure. ","1814":"The intense x-rays available at EBS-ESRF are known to be able to trigger undesired effects, such as chemical modifications in radiation sensitive materials. Recently, we have observed the chemical dissociation of the alcohol solution used as pressure transmitting medium in high-pressure experiments. The reaction is complex, involving the production of liquid hydrogen and solidification of solids of unknown stoichiometry. To determine the nature of the different products of this speciation as a function of pressure, we propose to perform X-Ray Raman Spectroscopy in-situ within Diamond Anvil Cell, as this is the only technic allowing us to probe the absorption edges of low-z elements under pressure. A successful experiment will lead to the determination of the nature of the modified pressure transmitting elements as a function of dose and pressure, providing a comprehensive base for the high-pressure community to design experiments and avoid undesired sample-environment interactions.","1815":"The thiospinel CuIr2S4 is discussed as an outstanding example for the spontaneous formation of complex superstructures (octamers) below a metal-insulator transition. The mechanism is still controversial. Theories range from an itinerant picture of an orbitally induced Peierls transition, neglec\u00acting spin-orbit coupling, to local models in which spin-orbit coupling and intersite Coulomb repulsion are decisive. In preliminary RIXS data, we found evidence for dimers in the metallic phase at 300 K, a very unexpected result. We propose a thorough RIXS study to clarify the origin of superstructures in this fascinating material, e.g. establishing whether the dimerisation is intrinsic or a remnant of the insulating phase.","1816":"This proposal seeks to illuminate 1) the nature of electronic structure and 2) the signatures of CDW\/SDW order in single crystals of La3Ni2O7 under pressure. Single crystals of La3Ni2O7 attract extensive attention of the whole materials science community due to its maximum superconductivity transition temperature above 77 K under pressures between 14.0 \u2212 43.5 gigapascals [1], most recently. This proposal will use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at Ni K edge to extract the multiple-orbital nature of La3Ni2O7 and illuminate the phase diagram of it under pressure. Complemented with exact diagonalization calculations, these results will give us valuable information regarding the nature of the electronic structure that the high-temperature superconductivity emerges from in La3Ni2O7.","1817":"The scientific renown of the iridium oxides (iridates) is strictly related to the formation of the exotic phases of matter arising from the delicate balance between various interactions at play, electronic correlation, crystal field and spin-orbit coupling, in particular. The most prominent example is the so-called Jeff = \u00bd ground state for the Ir4+ ions (5d5 electronic configuration) in octahedral coordination; depending on the lattice featuring corner-, edge- or face-sharing octahedra, then, materials behave very differently. Here, we propose to investigate Na4IrO4, where Ir4+ ions are coordinated to only four oxygens on a square planar plaquette, resulting in a complete modification of the electronic and magnetic structure, which cannot be framed into the conventional Jeff = \u00bd picture. RIXS investigation will allow us to corroborate or defy recent theoretical calculations, including the prediction of a giant magnetic anisotropy for Na4IrO4. \r\n","1818":"Due to magnetism, topological properties, electron correlations and their interplay, magnetic kagome materials are attracting attention as a platform to explore exotic quantum phases [1]. Recent studies on the correlated kagome magnet FeGe [2] exemplify this interplay-driven phenomenon, revealing an unprecedented CDW order, whose dynamics unveils an intriguing dimerization driven order-disorder scenario [3]. Similar to the 166 ScV6Sn6 compound demonstrated a soft lattice dynamics [4], YbFe6Ge6 hosts 2 kagome planes per unit cell and features the same magnetic order as FeGe. In this proposal, we aim at investigating the lattice dynamics of the antiferromanetic YbFe6Ge6 by means of diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) and search for diffuse signals, characteristic of pre-transitional fluctuations of soft modes. We intend to comprehensively measure the temperature and momentum dependence of the low energy acoustic and optical phonons by means of high-resolution IXS. ","1819":"Hexagonal EuAl12O19 exhibits a phase transition at Ts = 49 K visible in specific heat and thermal expansion. Pyroelectric measurements reveal polarization and temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity shows an unusual change of slope at Ts characteristic for improper ferroelectrics. At low temperatures, a dielectric dispersion resembling relaxor ferroelectrics is observed. However, second harmonic generation measurements did not show a breaking of center symmetry and synchrotron XRD did not reveal any structural change below Ts. Based on theoretical calculations on a similar system BaFe12O19 (Wang and Xiang, PRX 4, 011035 (2014)), we suggest that EuAl12O19 transfers into a frustrated antiferroelectric phase below Ts. This should be visible in diffuse X-ray scattering. In addition, phonon softening should be observed at the Brillouin zone boundary. Therefore, we propose to measure diffuse scattering (6 shifts) and phonons (12 shifts) at the BZ boundary as function of temperature. ","1820":"La2NiO4+d is a performant oxygen ion conductor already at room temperature. During the electrochemical oxygen uptake\/release reaction, a complex twin domain structure, anti-phase boundary domains and mesoscopic domain ordering is observed. The understanding of domain ordering for interface diffusion is mandatory to better understand diffusion processes at the interface. We propose here a controlled electrochemical reaction to explore in situ the formation of the domain structure and up to which extend domain sise and ordering periodicities depend on the current densities applied.","1821":"The recent discovery of chiral electric dipoles in PbTiO3 thin films, including vortices [1] and skyrmions [2], has attracted tremendous interest from both fundamental and practical points of view. To date, these textures have been exclusively produced in (001)-oriented films, where the tetragonal PbTiO3 exhibits three structural variants, namely a1\/a2 and c domains with their polarization along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. By contrast, the domain structures in (111)-oriented PbTiO3 films have not been systematically explored yet. Along the (111) orientation, PbTiO3 is expected to have three energetically degenerate structural variants, which constitute a markedly different situation for domain formation and its control. We propose a diffuse x-ray scattering study in which we will determine the nature of ferroelectric domain structures in a series of PbTiO3 films grown along the (111) orientation.","1822":"This proposal seeks to understand how the lattice dynamics of hexagonal MoSe2 changes with temperature. Inelastic xray scattering (IXS) measurements (beamtime HC-5550), has recenlty revealed for the first time a dramatic softening of the transverse acoustic mode of MoSe2 at the M point upon temperature reduction to 80K, anticipating a structural phase transition. This proposal aims to understand this vibrational instability and observe the phase transition by a combination of diffuse scattering (DS) and IXS extended to 10K. This study will provide a unique insight on the temperature dependence of the transport and optical properties of technologically-relevant transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), as controlled by the electron- and exciton- scattering with the zone-boundary acoustic phonons. The prospected results will guide the development of optoelectronic devices based on TMDs two-dimensional crystals.","1823":"This proposal aims to experimentally characterise the anisotropic lattice dynamics of the most stable allotrope of phosphorus, i.e. the monoclinic violet phosphorus, through a combination of x-ray diffuse scattering and inelastic x-ray scattering. This layered crystal has very recently emerged thanks to its favourable semiconducting properties and improved stability with respect to black phosphorus. From the phonon dispersions at terahertz frequencies, we plan to derive the macroscopic elastic properties of violet phosphorus and its elastic moduli. The elastic stiffness coefficients obtained here provide a fundamental benchmark for models of mechanical and thermodynamical properties of this yet unexplored layered allotrope of phosphorus and its related two-dimensional crystals, such as violet phosphorene, which is a promising quantum materials disclosing a huge potential for nanophotonics, optoelectronics.","1824":"In this experiment, we will study a strained-induced orientational transition of a charge-density-wave (CDW) that we recently evidenced in TbTe3, a nearly-tetragonal 2D van der Waals material. In the pristine state, the CDW is oriented along the in-plane c axis, and under tensile strain along the perpendicular in-plane direction a, the CDW disappears along c while it appears along a. We showed that this transition is directly related to the ratio of the in-plane lattice constants a\/c, and takes place when a=c. However, the way the CDW along a appears still has to be elucidated. In particular, it could appear through the nucleation of domains. The aim of this experiment is to check this scenario using a nanobeam. If domains appear, we will study their evolution under strain. If not, we will validate a scenario of spatially-coexisting CDW. We will additionally get a spatially-resolved measurement of CDW q-vectors under strain, and study the role of temperature. ","1825":"Surface and interface of Indium tin oxide (ITO) nanowires (NWs) with Sn tips are model systems to understand how in-plane oxide NWs were grown via vapor-liquid-solid method (VLS). So far, TEM studies have reported the atomic arrangement and interfacial structure of the Sn tip and ITO stem, but details of the growth mechanism are still unclear which can lead to fabrication of improved devices. Coherent nanobeam X-ray diffraction together with a 3D visualization of individual ITO NWs with Sn tips by Bragg ptychography will provide insight into the Young\u2019s equation related to the balance among the interfacial tensions involved in the VLS growth of horizontal NWs. In addition, in-situ studies will provide important clues to understand the evolution of atomic arrangements during the early stages of surface melting of metal nanocrystals.","1826":"The goal of this study is to observe the structural evolution of single palladium nanocrystals during hydrogen absorption and desorption in rarely explored regions of the phase diagram. The Pd-H system is extremely interesting for its capability to uptake large amount of hydrogen into interstitial sites with an accompanying lattice expansion. There exist several phenomena that have not been observed in single nanocrystals such as high temperature and pressure absorption, and absorption in the supercritical phase. As well as more exotic phenomena such as spinodal decomposition that is posited to exist in small single crystals. Using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) we are able to follow in-situ the evolution of the internal and surface strain in individual nanoparticles.","1827":"The aim of the proposal is to study disorder phenomena in single crystals of rutile-related metastable V0.92O2 grown at 10 GPa and 1373 K using diffuse scattering and the 3D-delta-PDF approach. We plan to (i) collect high quality 3D diffuse scattering data as a function of temperature, (ii) analyse the type of correlations (displacements, composition, or both) with the 3D-delta-PDF method, (iii) document the critical behaviour of the short-range correlations in the vicinity of the phase transition from the temperature evolution of characteristic features of diffuse scattering. ","1828":"Through this proposal, we aim to map the full dislocation density tensor field by recording 3 independent reflections using Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM). These high-resolution experimental maps will be integrated into state-of-the-art Continuum Dislocation Dynamics (CDD) models to address critical materials science questions. The insights gained will guide the development of improved numerical models and resolves long standing challenges in the understanding of dislocation dynamics.","1829":"ABO3 perovskites are an important class of functional materials. Cation ordering at A or B sites gives an AA\u2019B2O6 or A2BB\u2019O6 double perovskite (DPv) and 1:1 cation ordering at both sites can give an AA\u2019BB\u2019O6 double double perovskite (DDPv). CaMnMnWO6 undergoes a first order transition from a fully-ordered DDPv form to the A-site disordered DPv polymorph (Ca0.5Mn0.5)2MnWO6 at 1260 \u2070C under 10 GPa synthesis pressure. A 3DXRD grain mapping experiment on a ceramic pellet recovered from just below the transition that has approximately equal amounts of the DDPv and DPv phases is proposed. This will explore microstructural changes at the transition such as relations between domains and cell axis directions of the DDPv and DPv phases, and residual lattice strains within the ceramic sample after high-P,T treatment. The hard X-rays and high resolution of ID11 will be needed to distinguish between the very similar cell parameters of the DDPv and DPv phases within the bulk pellet.","1830":"Competing valence distributions across the interpenetrating sublattices of thiospinel materials have long been subject to debate. While many such compounds, like CuCr2S4, are simple (room temperature) ferromagnets, we were recently able to observe multiple low-temperature transitions by local magnetic probes. Moreover, using neutron powder diffraction, we discovered that at least one of the transitions in CuCr2S4 is associated with the formation of a commensurate superstructure. However, it remains unclear whether this should be assigned fully to structural or magnetic degrees of freedom, or to both. To understand the mechanisms of these transitions, we need to clarify whether (and how) they arise from the frustration of charge\/valence and magnetic degrees of freedom on the spinel lattice. Using low-temperature high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction, we propose to track the evolution of the structure, quantify magnetoelastic coupling and determine the origin of the superstructure.","1831":"Chiral metal halide perovskites are emerging as important materials for non-linear optical properties and spin-related phenomena due to their chiroptical and chiro-spintronic properties. To date several chiral perovskites have been prepared and characterized but the exact mechanism of chiral transfer is still elusive and on debate. It seems clear a key role of local octahedra distortion in promoting Rashba splitting of the conduction band giving origin to spin polarization. In this proposal we aim at investigating the local structure of archetypal 2D chiral perovskites where Rashba splitting has been determined and tentatively related to peculiar octahedra distortions by means of x-ray total scattering. ","1832":"Recent studies have demonstrated that YTiO3 exhibits transient ferromagnetism at temperatures nearly three times the thermodynamic Curie temperature TC = 28 K when subjected to all-optical, mode-selective phonon pumping [1]. By manipulating specific phonon modes, it is possible to either enhance and stabilize ferromagnetism or, conversely, reduce the net magnetic moment. This demonstrates that spin-phonon coupling in YTiO3 facilitates the dynamic control of its magnetic properties, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In the proposed study, we aim to confirm our hypothesis that the extraordinary sensitivity of the magnetic moment to phonon pumping may arise from a possible compensating magnetic moment on Y due to the hybridization of the Ti 3d-orbitals with the Y 4d-orbitals. We propose to perform a systematic XMCD study at the yttrium L2,3 X-ray absorption edges in La- and Ca-substituted YTiO3 as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field.","1833":"It is the aim of the proposal to investigate the presence and strength of an induced magnetic polarization in Py\/Pt spin pumping heterostructures (Py=permalloy, Ni80Fe20) at the Pt L-edges. We have experimental evidence from broadband (2 \u2013 40 GHz) ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments that the increase of the FMR linewidth broadening in Py\/Pt spin pumping heterostructures can be gradually suppressed by inserting thin Al spacer layers. However, as pointed out before chemical intermixing going hand-in-hand with an induced magnetic polarization of the Pt is a common concern for these types of functional interfaces. Thus, the investigation of an induced polarization of the Pt by means of L-edge XMCD is the method of choice [1]. It is known that Pt in direct contact with Fe exhibits a clear induced polarization [1]. A decrease of the XMCD signal with increasing Al spacer thickness can allow to correlate induced polarization with increased spin pumping efficiency.","1834":"We propose to investigate the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and its temperature-dependent sign change (Morin transition) in epitaxial thin films of the prototypical antiferromagnet alpha-Fe2O3. The scenario is well established in bulk with a Morin transition temperature of 263 K, in thin films it is still a matter of debate. However, a deeper understanding is mandatory because of its interplay with the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) between the Fe3+ moments, important for correctly describing the spin-Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) and its unexpected large amplitude as well as the magnon Hanle effect and its nonreciprocal behavior. The DMI breaks the inversion symmetry and leads to a finite canting of the antiferromagnetic sublattices, resulting in a tiny macroscopic magnetic moment in the (0001) plane. We will record the XMCD of this moment and the XMLD of the N\u00e9el order to quantify the DMI, to determine the Fe3+ canting angle, and to pinpoint the Morin transition temperature.","1835":"CeRu2 is a superconductor of type 2 (critical temperature at 6.2 K) with a peculiar electronic structure. In order to shed some light on these exotic properties of CeRu2, we propose to analyze the Ce-L2,3 absorption edges by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD), which probe the Ce 5d electrons. The latter contribute to the metallic bond and are highly sensitive to the electronic structure. We propose to evidence a possible modification of the hybridization of the 4f electrons when going through the critical temperature on the ID12 beamline.","1836":"Pr-enriched LaFe12B6 compounds exhibit a range of magneto-related effects, including giant magnetoresistance, significant magnetostrictive, and magnetocaloric effects below 200 K using modest magnetic fields, making them promising multifunctional materials. In contrast, the parent compound LaFe12B6 requires more extreme conditions (T < 50 K and \u03bc0H > 7 T), limiting its practical use. The ULMAG experimental setup allows for comprehensive characterization by simultaneously measuring macroscopic magnetization, resistivity, adiabatic temperature change, dilation\/contraction effects, element-specific XMCD, and powder X-ray diffraction under various conditions. This characterization is ideal for unraveling the role of Pr in the interplay between magnetism and structure in the La1-xPrxFe12B6 system. Studying these magneto-structural changes and their dependence on external parameters will provide insights into the mechanisms driving these multifunctional properties.","1837":"Understanding the fundamental link between low-dimensional magnetism and spin, charge, and orbital correlations is key for the development of novel spintronic and magnetoelectric devices based on van der Waals (vdW) materials. CrTe2 is a unique vdW compound with intrinsic in-plane magnetization and Curie temperature above room temperature of TC = 310 K. Lattice parameter anomalies near TC suggest a complex relationship between low-dimensional magnetism and orbital\/lattice degrees of freedom. By applying magnetic circular dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering on bulk CrTe2 samples across TC we will identify spin, orbital, and charge excitations that are sensitive to the magnetic state. Multiplet calculations will help resolve the electronic configuration and spin-state of Cr ions. The dispersion curve of spin excitations will be probed. This work sheds light on the correlation between low-dimensional magnetism and spin-orbital excitations in this compound.","1838":"Charge density waves (CDWs) have been observed in all underdoped cuprates, but the role of in-plane anisotropy is still missing in their microscopic description to date. In the model system YBa2Cu3O6+x (Y123), the a- and b-CDW domains have a significant in-plane anisotropy that cannot be attributed to crystal orthorhombicity. Our recent RIXS experiments on minimally disordered YBa2Cu4O8 (Y124) further revealed an asymmetric response of the CDW domains to different uniaxial strain directions. This a\/b anisotropy is not present in Y123 and possibly rooted in the intrinsic nematic responses of CuO2 planes. We therefore propose a continuation RIXS experiment on Y124, to systematically measure both a- and b-CDW response under a- and b-axis uniaxial strain, respectively. We believe that the full evolution of intensity and correlation lengths of both domains will provide a better understanding of in-plane anisotropy and underlying nematicity in the yttrium-based cuprate family.","1839":"CrSb has been identified as a prominent candidate for observing altermagnetic (AM) chiral-split magnon spectra. AMs are novel spintronic platforms due to their strong time reversal symmetry-breaking responses akin to ferromagnets and fully compensated magnetization typical of collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs). CrSb orders ferromagnetically (Tc=705 K) with the [001] planes coupled antiferromagnetically along the easy c-axis. ARPES measurements have revealed a spin-split band structure reaching up to 1eV, but evidence for the predicted spin-split chiral magnon spectra is lacking. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolved a gapped magnon dispersion (~10 meV) with a bandwidth of ~60meV. We propose a momentum and polarization-resolved RIXS experiment at the Cr L2,3 edge (~580 eV) to reveal the time-reversal symmetry-breaking nature of the low energy magnetic excitations in CrSb.","1840":"This proposal concerns the study of local excitations in Ba2MgReO6, a 5d1 system shown recently to display multipolar order, with strong entanglement between spin, orbit and vibronic degrees of freedom. The local ReO6 environment is highly-symmetric, recently shown to be distorted due to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Our previous RIXS data revealed two main d-d excitations, the splitting of the jeff=3\/2 quartet into two doublets and the SOC-induced gap. Each d-d excitation develops a high-energy tail, which has been described using a set of equidistant modes, but the low resolution did not allow to properly characterize their energies and the number of those additional modes. The current experiment aims to address this problem by utilising high-resolution RIXS beamline at ID32. We plan to measure RIXS at the O K-edge of Ba2MgReO6, with the desired resolution of 20meV fully achievable on this instrument.","1841":"We propose to investigate the uranium chemical state in ultra-clean samples of the recently discovered unconventional superconductor UTe2 using high-energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) and Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the uranium M\u2084 edge, comparing the results with UGe2 and previously measured UGa2. HERFD-XANES and RIXS have proven effective [1] in providing fingerprint information on the oxidation state, probing 5f occupancy, and offering detailed insights into mixed-valence states in actinide materials. We anticipate that applying this high-resolution spectroscopic technique to UX\u2082 compounds will yield crucial information on their electronic structure and enhance our understanding of how different p-block ligands influence the 5f electron configurations and consequently, the resulting materials\u2019 properties.","1842":"Silver chloride, AgCl, adopts the rocksalt crystal structure at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature. AgCl was observed to undergo at 6.6 GPa a structural phase transition to a monoclinic structure. Computational work attributed this transition to a lattice-dynamical instability of the transverse-acoustic (TA) phonon branch under pressure. In contrast to plentiful computational work, corresponding high-pressure experimental data are conspicuously lacking. We ask for 9 shifts of beamtime on ID15B to study AgCl single crystals with thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) as a function of pressure. The principal aim of this work is to determine the complete phonon dispersion relations of AgCl and their variation with pressure, with particular interest in the predicted instability of a TA phonon branch. These results will yield crucial experimental data and provide insight into the role that a phonon instability may play in driving the structural phase transition in AgCl near 7 GPa.","1843":"Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations predicted the existence of a plastic phase of Ice VII more than a decade ago, however its experimental observation has remained elusive. Recently we obtained the first experimental identification of such phase by high pressure and high temperature quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments performed at ILL. We here propose to perform an X-Ray Diffraction experiment on ID15B in order to assess some of the open questions regarding this new phase of Ice.  We aim at understanding the order of the phase transition, determining the pressure-temperature stability range, and characterizing the mechanical properties of such phase.","1844":"Recent observations of high-Tc superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials have catalyzed a notable shift in the high-pressure field toward synthesizing novel \u201csuperhydrides\u201d. Lanthanide hydrides have emerged as promising candidates for achieving structures with exceptionally high hydrogen content.  Recent findings have spurred theoretical investigations predicting superconducting polyhydrides within the lanthanide hydride series, with Er hydrides identified as prospective contenders. In our preliminary experiment, we observe the synthesis of multiple novel erbium polyhydrides. Here, we propose to extensively study the Er-H system up to 200 GPa, as it is imperative that we collect additional high-quality data to characterise the novel phases with confidence and determine their stability fields prior to performing electrical transport measurements to probe their superconducting properties.","1845":"Superhydrides form a novel class of compounds obtained through the significant uptake of hydrogen by a metal under high hydrogen pressure, with great potential for hydrogen storage and high-temperature superconductivity. However, none has yet been recovered at ambient pressure. The search for such recoverable superhydrides is now focusing on ternary hydrides. The goal of this proposal is to explore the Cu-Li-H and Pb-Li-H systems. Lithium should aid electrons transfer and favor the formation of superhydrides when combined to Pb or Cu. In particular, Li\u2082CuH\u2086 has been recently predicted to be a recoverable metastable compound at ambient pressure with a Tc around 80 K. The hydriding of Li-Pb compounds is also of great importance in view of the widespread use of Li-Pb compounds as coolants and tritium breeders in nuclear fusion reactors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) will be crucial for identifying any new compounds, and DFT calculations will then be performed to obtain the hydrogen positions.","1846":"The aim of this proposal is to extend XRD measurements of Au and Pt from 150 GPa to above 600 GPa under hydrostatic conditions using a Ne pressure-transmitting medium in a toroidal DAC. Simultaneous determination of the volumes of these three elements at various pressures will be useful to test and potentially refine the recently proposed calibration of gold and platinum, based on shockless compression experiments, as standards up to 1 TPa. Platinum is expected to remain in the fcc structure up to 1 TPa. While a sequence of fcc-hcp-bcc phase transitions has been predicted for gold, the transition pressures remain debated. Here, we expect to unambiguously observe the fcc-hcp transition by reaching slightly above 600 GPa. Finally, this data set will allow for a critical assessment of XRD measurements of these two elements under nanosecond compression, the current approach used to investigate the atomic structure of matter at TPa pressures.","1847":"Gas molecules encapsulated in a water matrix, i.e., gas hydrates, are found in confined pressurized environments, such as on the sea floor of Earth or the interiors of icy bodies surrounding our Solar system. They are suitable for the storage of light energy carriers such as methane or hydrogen. Especially, hydrogen hydrates offer carbon-free high energy content per unit mass (~14 MJ\u00b7kg-1). They are promising functional materials for clean energy storage and offer alternative to the current cryo-compressed hydrogen storage technology. In this proposal, we aim to explore the phase diagram and, therefore, determine the  melting curves of C2 (H2O\u00b7H2) and recently discovered C3 (H2O\u00b72H2) hydrogen-filled ices along with their stability ranges with respect to decomposition into H2O and H2.","1848":"This proposal investigates phonon dynamics following photoexcitation that demagnetizes antiferromagnetic (AFM) CuO. Using time-resolved magnetic diffuse scattering, we recently clarified that the demagnetization leads to magnon creation in a large reciprocal-space volume and that the magnons spontaneously condense at the \u0393 point with a spin gap. Further relaxation processes to annihilate magnons are likely mediated by phonon emission, which should be exclusive in momentum (q) because of the energy conservation rule. Therefore, we expect q-selective phonon excitation on the timescale of magnon annihilation. To verify this, we propose performing time-resolved diffuse scattering, witch has both time- and q-resolution. The achievement will allow us (1) to establish the reciprocal-space picture of the recovery process from a photo-created non-equilibrium AFM state, which will form the basis of AFM-based spintronics, and (2) to extract the mode-selective magnon-phonon coupling strength. ","1849":"We propose to measure the temperature dependence of the non-ergodicity factor in vitreous germanium oxide, v-GeO2, through the X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS). We aim to compare the slow dynamics probed here with the fast dynamics determined by IXS in the same Q range. This comprehensive investigation will provide a view of the spectrum of relaxation processes in GeO2 in a wide time window between ps and seconds, enabling us to verify the presence of secondary relaxation processes.","1850":"The iridate Ba4Ir3O10 hosts a quasi-2D network of trimers and has been discussed as an unusual quantum spin liquid. RIXS data have been explained in terms of a quasi-1D spinon continuum based on frustrated intra-trimer exchange. We acquired some RIXS data of Ba4Ir3O10 with 60 meV resolution upon commissioning at ID20, establishing the trimer nature of the electronic states above 0.3 eV. The picture of intra-trimer exchange proposed in the litearture is not applicable. We will determine the character of the magnetic excitations and a possible quantum spin-liquid nature with a careful high-resolution RIXS study. ","1851":"This proposal aims at using inelastic x-ray scattering to study in detail the nuclear contribution to the spin-lattice hybrid excitation previously observed in the spinel GeCo2O4 by inelastic neutron scattering with polarization analysis. The goal is first to check its phononic nature, then track its dispersion and temperature dependence in order to confirm the presence of a spin-lattice coupling in this compound.

We propose to examine\r\nby \u03bc-XRF and \u03bc-XANES at the Zn and S K edges, 5 original paint micro samples taken from paintings by\r\nJan Van Eyck.

The reconversion is temporary; therefore newly developed lead based-stabilization treatments using ammonium phosphate or ammonium oxalate were also tested.\r\nWe aim to identify the series of lead-compounds formed after the tests and to monitor their chemical changes over time.","1861":"Recent developments in inelastic and X-ray Raman scattering have shown major interest for studying the organic chemistry of cultural heritage artifacts. This LTP aims to address the main limitation of the technique by lowering the deposited dose. This can be achieved by optimizing 3-D image acquisition and chemical speciation through coupling with advanced statistical analysis and machine learning, exploiting redundancy in the collected data. This project assembles experts in heritage materials, data science and inelastic scattering instrumentation. Chemical composition and degradation mechanisms of contemporary art materials will be studied using materials from a major post-war, contemporary artist: Simon Hanta\u00ef. XRS experiments will be performed iteratively with methdological developments to advance the imaging processing software. An openly available environment to process datasets acquired will be created for ESRF users with applications to all fields of materials sciences.","1863":"This study proposes a combined Tomography \/ Diffraction \/ Fluorescence experiment on samples of three medieval Spanish artworks will investigate the subtle differences in their ground layers, containing variable forms of gypsum (CaSO2 x 2H2O). The results should confirm attribution and link to other artworks from the same period\/region, thus granting unique insights into the historical and technical context.","1866":"In collaboration with Key Laboratory for Cultural Heritage Study & Conservation of Northwest University, China, we want to determine the crystalline composition and gain insights into non-crystalline phases through pair distribution function analysis of a representative set of Chinese lead-barium glasses produced during the Han Dynasty. The few Chinese studies and our preliminary results seem to indicate that the crystalline phases are rather in small quantity in theses glasses. In addition, XRD-lab indicates the presence of non-crystalline lead oxide clusters or nanocrystals, which could play a significant role in the glass opacification. Previous studies have shown that barium is implicated in the process of glass opacification but we believed that lead could also be involved. An analyse of the crystalline content through the Rietveld method combined with a PDF study will provide valuable data concerning the actual crystalline composition and the local structure of vitreous phase ","1868":"The blackening of red cinnabar pigment is a major problem of conservation for the artworks containing it. To explain the black color, different hypotheses have been proposed, but none of them has been fully confirmed. This proposal aims to identify the newly formed black phases, comparing the results in model fresco paintings subjected to accelerated weathering experiments and the ones in blackened cinnabar fresco painting samples from the Archaeological Park of Pompeii. The possible presence of additional Hg-Cl and Hg-S-Cl species, not easily detectable by conventional laboratory techniques, will be also confirmed. The resulting information will allow refining the understanding of the chemical reactivity leading to the darkening of cinnabar, contributing to develop appropriate conservation protocols to preserve this precious pigment. To achieve these objectives, a combination of \u00b5XRF, Cl and S K-edge \u00b5XANES and Hg L3 edge \u00b5XANES in HERFD mode is crucial.","1869":"The synthesis of cobalt green pigments ((Zn1-x\u2013Cox)O) from the 19th century remains unstudied. However, it resulted in pigments with various Co\/Zn ratios, that ultimately influenced their optical properties. A multi-technique investigation coupling XRF-CT and scanning 3DXRD is proposed to provide high resolution data on the morphology and composition of historical pigment samples to better understand their synthesis history and its effect on the final optical properties of the pigment particle. More specifically, the enrichment of cobalt inside of the pigment particles can reach very low dimensions or densities, yet have major effect on its visual appearance. Only the high resolution of XRF-CT and s3DXRD make possible to detail the powder heterogeneous composition at the sub-millimetric scale.","1870":"A single ceramic fragment contains information on geographical origin as well as on the technological and firing processes of an artifac. This experiment aims to study ceramic fragments by acquiring X-ray tomographic and diffractometric data in synchronous to visualize the presence of phases associated with specific domains of the ceramic body. These data will be useful to reconstruct homogeneity and inhomogeneity formed during the firing process and to visualize the neoformation phases related to the circulation of fluids within the sample. Coupling the tomographic technique on the same fragments, we will be able to evaluate fractures, pores and voids to determine the state of preservation, isorientation of the crystalline phases and the mutual relationship between amorphous and crystalline components. The analyses will be carried out on ceramic fragments from archaeological sites in Italy, providing new analytical protocols for the study and conservation of the archaeological finds.","1871":"During the 2005 excavation campaign at the Capitolium of Cumae, the first Greek colony on the mainland of Italy, pottery was unearthed.\r\nPottery is considered one of the elements that set off the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution and changed the human beings\u2019 lifestyle from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement. The study of the pottery production method is useful to understand the technological level reached by an ancient civilization. One of the most informative aspects is the firing history which includes the heating rate, the maximum temperature reached, the firing duration and the atmosphere in which the ceramic is fired that can be oxidising or reducing. \r\nThanks to different experimental techniques like XRPD, XRF, SEM and FTIR, is possible to estimate the firing history, characterize the raw materials used for the pottery production and, finally, understand if these relics have been fired in the open air or closed kiln.\r\n\r\n","1872":"The last decade has seen an intense scientific debate on Neanderthal lineage growth pattern. The pioneering use of synchrotron imaging on fossils teeth allowed for the first time to record neanderthal dental growth in a non-destructive way. However, relatively few samples have been analyzed and variability in the growth pattern and associated evolutionary mechanisms are still largely unknown. To answer these questions, we collected a large sample of unpublished and invaluable fossil teeth of the Neanderthal lineage in Europe. We have also selected modern human deciduous teeth with the specific focus of investigating their family relationships based on the heritability of dental growth biorhythms which are under strong genetic control. ID19 is the only hard X-ray beamline in Europe enabling to image dental hard tissues microstructure for paleoanthropology with high coherence, low dose, high energy photons, a large field-of-view, and using phase contrast \u00b5CT.","1874":"This proposal aims at deepening understanding the complex discoloration issue of emerald green and Scheele\u2019s green paints (hereafter called \u201cEM\u201d and \u201cSH\u201d, respectively) affecting late 19th c.-early 20th c. oil paintings. \u00b5-XRF mapping and \u00b5-XANES spectroscopy at S K-, Cu K- and As K-edges will be exploited to perform a spatially resolved study of EM and SH oil paint systems before and after exposure to controlled conditions of light, humidity and temperature.

Using computed tomography pair distribution function analysis (ctPDF) we mapped the locations, phase, composition and morphology of nano-contaminants (recently published in Matter).  The crucial next stage of conservation is to develop methods to remove the harmful contaminants. We have demonstrated a remediation whereby magnetic nanoparticles are functionalized to capture a contaminant, soaked into the wood, then pulled out using magnetic fields.  No information is known about where the nanoparticles penetrate into the wood, what features constitute barriers to their incursion, how effective they are at removing contaminants, and whether they are all removed during the harvesting process. We will use ctPDF to obtain a \u2018time-lapse view\u2019 of this process using ex situ ctPDFplus fluorescence tomography from a set of samples at various stages of the process.","1876":"In 2017 a medallion dated 1508 and carrying the signature of Albrecht D\u00fcrer (AD), one of the greatest masters of the Northern Renaissance, was discovered. To date this would be the first known surviving goldsmith work by AD. So far all information concerning this medallion appear to support its authenticity. But, to fully confirm its authorship, it is necessary to reveal the history of the metal used to produce the medallion. Combining X-ray transmission diffraction with X-ray fluorescence we allows us to reveal which method was used to work the metal, and what the origin of the used metal was, respectively. Both pieces of information are the last ones to complete the puzzle of this mysterious medallion.","1877":"The degradation phenomena of cadmium red (CdS1-xSex) oil paint pigments is a process that starts from the surface. We wish to study this process with a depth-selective method by using Se K-edge XAFS spectroscopy and comparing data collected simultaneously in X-ray fluorescence Yield (FY) and total electron yield (TEY) detection modes. We intend to determine the oxidation state, coordination numbers and interatomic distances of Se-compounds. These analyses will permit to define how some intrinsic properties of the pigment (crystal defects\/Se content) and environmental agents influence Se speciation within cadmium red paints.","1878":"The objective of this proposal is to gain insight into the degradation processes taking place at the surface of illustrated papyrus from Ancient Egypt and part of the Champollion museum collection (D\u00e9partement de l'Is\u00e8re, Vif, France).

First, we want to quantify the state of alteration of smalt in historical and model samples in order to propose digital reconstructions of the original aspects of the paintings and second, we want to investigate the chemical interactions between the pigment and its environment to have a better understanding on the weathering causes. MicroXANES at the Co K-edge at ID21 has successfully been used to differentiate an altered smalt from a well-preserved one, but the penetration of X-rays at this energy prevents probing the state of weathering at the grain scale. We propose to combine submicronic XRF and high resolution microXANES mapping of smalt grains and their environment at the Co and K K-edges to relate its chemical state to the color of the grains and to follow the chemical transformations of K leached out of the grains","1880":"This proposal is a continuation of the HG-172 BAG experiment, a new access route to the ESRF structural analysis capacities for the Heritage Science community. The upgrade to the ESRF-EBS was the triggering element to propose a single block allocation group (BAG). Two complementary analytical configurations are used in the BAG: High angular resolution XRD (ID22) and High lateral resolution XRD (ID13). The combination of these two beamlines generates precious clues on the origin, processing and degradation of historical materials. By relying on the new analytical capacities of the EBS combined with optimized access route, sample preparation procedures and processing pipelines, the Heritage BAG has proven to be a very efficient way to increase the output of the Cultural Heritage community, to reinforce a scientific network of expert users structured around the ESRF, and to initiate new European collaborations in Heritage Science.","1881":"Cumae was founded by Greeks in the 8th century BCE and is regarded the first colony established on the European continent. The colony was famous for the quality of the ceramic production and specifically cooking pottery. This project aims to learn more about the production methods and firing conditions used in the ancient colony of Cumae. We would like to call the attention on two types of samples in particular: cooking pottery shards and painted ceramics. These two types of samples caught our interest following the X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments performed on ID22. The high quality of the observed diffraction profiles allowed us to characterize the mineral composition and find peculiar phases. Further analysis on these types of samples would help to generalize these findings and clarify the pottery production methods and the raw materials used to create Cumaean pottery.","1882":"The present study aims at ascertain the valence state speciation of the transition elements (Cu and Co) suspected to play a role in the origin of the blue colour of protohistoic vitreous materials. The case study is provided by 5 different glass artefacts coming from Paduli (Colli sul Velino, Rieti, Italy), where a relevant ability in controlling chromatic effects has been reached by opportunely mixing the two elements, and controlling the thermal process. Only an accurate X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) investigation could allow to ascertain the effective metal speciations in the artefacts, thus providing a clue in the understanding of the technological process active in the area.","1883":"Our recently published article in Nature on the origins of endothermy sparked considerable new hope to settle one of the oldest mysteries of paleontology: the origins of mammalian warm-bloodedness (i.e., endothermy). Despite attempting to scan multiple specimens that are in the phylogenetic borderline of Mammaliamorpha, the first synapsid clade retrieved as endothermic, none of those scans did not retrieve usable results. Therefore, our previous analysis only made use of three non-mammaliamorph probainognathian species, which is admittedly unsatisfactory to resolve the debate. Hence, we propose to scan using propagation phase-contrast tomography various key specimens to extract their inner ear anatomy and internal cranial osteology. Thus, through the use of phylogenetic comparative methods, a broad extant baseline comparative sample, and biomechanical principles we can estimate the body temperature of these mammalian ancestors and accurately predict the origin of endothermy.","1884":"The tempera grassa painting technique, based on emulsions of egg yolk and oil, is a key marker of the evolution of artistic practice during the Renaissance. Yet despite its significance in art history, it remains barely studied from a physico-chemical point of view. Distinctive properties may arise from the organization of the different phases (egg yolk, oil, pigment particles) at a colloidal scale. Therefore, a method allowing three-dimensional mapping and chemical identification of these systems at the nanometric scale is essential. We propose to carry out phase contrast X-ray nano-holotomography on laboratory-prepared paint samples for this purpose. Previous encouraging results were obtained on these samples and demonstrated the ability to discriminate egg yolk compounds from oil droplets thanks to the high spatial resolution allowed by synchrotron radiation and to the sensitivity of phase contrast tomography to organic compounds. ","1885":"Since antiquity, calcium antimonates crystals have been used for the glass opacification as they provide a white coloration to objects. Chromophores (3d transition elements) can be added during the manufacture of glass to bring new colors. We are interested in the study of opacification processes used for the manufacture of roman mosaic tesserae dating from the 4th century AD. We are interested in the influence of copper and its redox interactions with antimony on the crystallization kinetics. Laboratory-reproduced glasses of similar compositions to the tesserae studied were synthesized by varying the conditions of synthesis. The redox state quantification of Sb and Cu will be obtained by \u00b5XANES measurements within the glass matrix. These results can be compared to the same analyses performed on the white and turquoise roman tesserae. This study can be crucial to understand the manufacturing techniques used by master glassmakers for the manufacture of tesserae of roman mosaic colored.","1886":"Human primary teeth start to form between the sixth and eighth week of prenatal development. An accentuated marking line, the neonatal line (NNL), forms at birth caused by the physiological changes. The NNL identification is the only method in paleoanthropological studies that allows us to distinguish if a child died before or after birth and to calculate an infant's exact period of survival, but it is difficult to determine.  Dean et al (2019) recently discover thet NNL coud be detected by SRXRF, by the increment of Zn (20-100 ppm). We want to determine the chronological age of perinatal skeletal remains and establish mortality patterns in  22 individuals of Iberian archaeological site of Olerdola (Spain) and analyze them using SRXRF. This study will help provide insights into the practices of infanticide in Iberian culture and contribute to the field of physical and forensic anthropology.","1887":"A study of historical wall painting cross sections suspected to contain early examples of synthetic Cu-based blue pigments is presented, employing Cu and Cl K-edge XANES alongside \u00b5-XRF and \u00b5-XRD. Blue verditer, a synthetic basic copper carbonate, has been identified in paintings from the 16th-18th centuries, but has not been adequately studied scientifically. These samples are highly heterogeneous, necessitating spatially resolved \u00b5-XRF and \u00b5-XANES to clarify the identity of pigments and understand the presence of chlorine, which may be due to intentional use of copper chloride pigments or degradation\/alteration processes. Mock paintouts aged under high Cl conditions are studied to contextualise the presence of chlorine. This work improves our understanding of early modern pigment use, production, and degradation. Basic copper carbonates and chlorides are also relevant to catalyst production and geochemistry, so this research has utility beyond cultural heritage as well.","1888":"The objective of the current proposal is to carry out similar investigations on black and white porcelains which were produced in large quantity but from local raw materials and mainly intended for local markets. These productions are an interesting example of manufacturing fine objects from inexpensive materials of variable quality. The rather complex and heterogeneous microstructure of decors, coming from the use of weakly refined materials, is an invaluable source of information concerning the manufacturing processes. Moreover, these productions were not managed by the central power such as more prestigious productions; their study is also a good an appropriate way to investigate the local traditions and specifically to study how craftsmen were able to take advantage of their local resource. In order to analyse the entire complex structure of those porcelains, we propose to perform hierarchical imagings by scanning X-ray microscope on ID21 of a selection of samples.

By non-destructively studying the distribution of newly formed phases and their interaction with stone microstructures, we aim to enhance our understanding of stone conservation techniques and ensure the long-term durability of cultural artifacts. Results are expected to provide crucial insights into phase identification, crystallinity, voids, and treatment-microstructure interactions, advancing the knowledge in calcite stone conservation and supporting the application of inorganic treatments on worksites. ","1891":"Botanical collections (herbaria) are unique archives for botanical research, which help preserve plant genetic resources and biodiversity. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) was widely employed to botanical specimens to prevent samples\u2019 degradation [1]. Over time, HgCl2 decomposes to Hg0, which readily vaporizes, becoming a serious occupational health hazard for the workers and visitors of worldwide collections [2-5]. \r\nThe present project aims at investigating Hg-contaminated botanical collections of the Erbario Centrale Italiano of the Natural History Museum of the University of Firenze (Italy) by non-destructive techniques, such High Resolution X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (HR-XANES). The proposed experiment will reveal the Hg speciation in the botanical samples, the paper supports, and the wooden storage cabinets, offering specific information to set-up restoration methods, combining mitigation of the potential Hg exposures to humans with preservation of sample integrity.","1892":"Common in the XIX and XX centuries treatment of silk fabrics with inorganic salts (weighting) is believed to be the reason of rapid degradation of historical objects in museum collections worldwide. Although, the scale of the problem is emerging, knowledge of the chemical paths of these processes is still limited. In frames of SafeSilk project devoted to deepen the knowledge of degradation mechanisms, we propose to employ SR-XRD imaging to track changes in the crystal microstructure of silk fibers treated using various weighting methods, subsequently artificially aged, and compare them with the conservation state of the historical ones. The obtained insights will help to evaluate the influence of different internal (weighting methods) and external (aging) parameters on the degradation of silk fibers.","1893":"Palm leaves were extensively used in Asia for the production of writing support, where the preparation process varies depending on the area. Although there are large collections of palm leaf manuscripts (PLM), scientific and humanitarian research to classify these documents is still lacking. By understanding the evolution of the structural and mechanical features of the leaves we expect to be able to trace the history of unclassified PLM. In a preliminary measurement we already proved that SAXS and WAXS are useful techniques to identify structural differences between 4 leaves of different origins and in different stages of preparation and 5 PLM. However, the number of samples was insufficient to draw solid conclusions. This time, we will use a total of 60 reference samples including herbarium leaves, leaves prepared at different monasteries with different recipes, and manuscripts. Also 5 to 10 historical manuscripts will be analyzed to investigate their origin and production method. ","1894":"The ESRF has been asked to help for the preparation of the restoration of the old violin called the \"Cannone\" that was played by Paganini in the late 18th century. This invaluable violin needs to be repaired, but due to the extent of degradations, and considering that it is still played regularly, a very detailed assessment of its present state is required. BM18 with its hierarchical propagation phase contrast microtomography capabilities with low dose setup is currently the best location in the world to conduct this study. Nevertheless, considering the importance of this violin, a dry run with another less valuable violin, as well as a modern copy of the Cannone is required to test all the protocols, including the control of the humidity and dosimetry. This proposal hence covers both the dry run on the two test violins and the real experiment. It is performed on directors contingency beamtime.","1895":"This proposal is a continuation of the HG-213 and HG-172 BAG pexperiments, a new access route to the ESRF structural analysis capacities for the Heritage Science community. The upgrade to the ESRF-EBS was the triggering element to propose a single block allocation group (BAG). Two complementary analytical configurations are used in the BAG: High angular resolution XRD (ID22) and High lateral resolution XRD (ID13). The combination of these two beamlines generates precious clues on the origin, processing and degradation of historical materials. By relying on the new analytical capacities of the EBS combined with optimized access route, sample preparation procedures and processing pipelines, the Heritage BAG has proven to be a very efficient way to increase the output of the Cultural Heritage community, to reinforce a scientific network of expert users structured around the ESRF, and to initiate new European collaborations in Heritage Science.","1896":"The project began with the study of the painting \u2018Il quarto stato\u2019 by the Italian divisionist painter Giovanni Pellizza da Volpedo. The study of the painted materials is important to obtain information on the painting process, the material's provenance, and the production technology, or to observe and prevent the degradation process. In this project, we propose to study with XAS a corpus of seven CdS1-xSex pigments produced with historical techniques and bound with four historical and modern binders, before and after artificial aging. The aim is to employ Cd K- and L3-edges, and Se and S K-edges, to observe and quantify structural changes in the pigment-binder systems due to photochemical alterations. This information will give deeper insights into the degradation processes occurring in these materials as observed in many paintings of the XIX and XX centuries, helping to better preserve these artifacts.","1897":"Black-to-brown glazed ceramics manufactured during the Song Dynasty have become a hot topic since the discovery of \u03b5\u2011Fe2O3 at their surface.

In addition, their high cultural importance, in particular in Japan and China, is another key reason that drives this study of their manufacturing process. Here, we propose a unique combination of M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy (ID14) and Fe K\u03b1 edge \u00b5-XANES (ID21\/ ID24) to study Fe speciation and distribution in fragments of historical Song ceramics.","1898":"A large fraction of 20th century audiovisual heritage is stored on magnetic tape. However, tapes suffer from wear and chemical decay that make them unreadable using magnetic heads, which are in physical contact with the tape.

These degradation products consist mostly of several potassium and sodium sulphates in the yellow regions, and chloride lead-based phases in the white regions. Unfortunately, the reactions paths remain unclear due to the lack of crystalline intermediate compounds.

Probing the Ce L\u2083 edge will reveal the Ce\u00b3\u207a\/Ce\u2074\u207a ratio and oxygen vacancy behavior, while the Gd L\u2083 edge will clarify dopant environments. Transition metal K-edge studies will uncover oxidation states, coordination environments, and nanoparticle formation mechanisms. This research will enhance our understanding of dopant interactions within the material and reduction conditions, optimizing the material\u2019s performance for energy conversion applications.","2969":"XRDCT of a grading material sample produced by direct energy deposition with powder (SS316L --> 9Cr).\nExperiments for the feasibility of the ReMade project","2970":"Test of the strain and misorientation grade after polishing in Zr\/Cr polycrystalline materials","2971":"investigations of the effects of the different parameters on the sealing of the bonding interface in wafer direct bonding","2972":"Tomography scans on bulk samples","2973":"Inthis experiment XAS at the Cu-K edge will be used in order to elucidate the incorporation site of Cu dopants in SbSe thin films","2974":"The structural degradation of metallic interconnects is one of the main failure mechanisms limiting the lifetime of High Electron Mobility Transistors.

In particular we were able to determine the structure, dynamics and function of the myosin motor domains in different regions of the thick filament during contraction. Now we propose to determine the role of thick filament stress in controlling the rate of relaxation in cardiac trabeculae, using mechanical protocols that mimic the physiological working cycle of the heartbeat.","3315":"Regulation of muscle contraction is due to mechanisms on both thin and thick filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins on the thin filament allow the myosin motors to attach to actin. Thick filament regulation is based on a still undefined mechanosensor that adapts to the load of the contraction the number of motors switched ON from the resting (OFF) state, in which they lie on the thick filament. In the heartbeat the internal [Ca2+] transient may not attain saturation and Ca2+-sensitivity of the filament is a relevant parameter under the control of several modulatory mechanisms, like the length dependent activation and the degree of phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins.  Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. Using X-ray diffraction on intact heart trabeculae we define the role of the sarcomeric proteins in the interfilament communication and in the mechanosensing that controls the switching ON of the myosin motors.","3316":"The dual regulation of muscle contraction provides that, beyond the classical Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation that makes the actin available for interaction with myosin motors, thick filament mechano-sensing switches ON the motors from the energetically convenient OFF state in relation to the load. Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of sarcomere proteins: titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to its tip and then extends from there to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in the central one-third and bridges thin filaments. Our research is aimed at verifying MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The planned experiments, conducted in intact skeletal muscle fibres, are based on the recent finding that X-ray fine structure of thick filament reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin.","3317":"Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has been used to study effects of freezing and freeze-drying on\r\nproteins, by monitoring changes in protein interaction peak The proposed study is a continuation of  LS-2793, in which\r\npharmaceutical proteins were studied by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS\/\r\nWAXS) during freezing and thawing. \r\n[2]. The aims of the proposed study are  (i) to investigate role of freeze-concentration vs.\r\nice\/solution interfaces on protein\/protein interaction, using time- and temperature-resolved\r\nSAXS\/WAXS measurements; and (ii) to study evolution of protein structure and protein\/protein\r\ninteraction during rehydration of freeze-dried protein\/sugar powders. \r\nPharmaceutically relevant proteins will be utilized.","3318":"The goal of this proposal is to assess the bone quality of osteosarcoma (OS) resected human tissue, by using xray\r\nscanning micro-diffraction at a spatial resolution down to 1 micron. This will allow to visualise and\r\nevaluate the bone microarchitecture, bone mineral platelets and collagen fibrils of osteosarcoma tissue. The bone microarchitectures and bone quality of OS will be compared with the healthy control bone and with histological data of the same subject. Due to its rarity, osteosarcoma is still lacking a reliable and\r\nprecise characterization of the bone quality morphology as well as microarchitecture information at the micron scale. The results of this proposal will help to tackle this gap and will get a better understanding of bone quality, microarchitecture changes in OS tissue.","3319":"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many critical cellular processes. We will use laser-induced release from a caged, inactive form of ATP followed by short X-ray pulses at the dedicated time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) beamline ID09 at ESRF-EBS to study protein conformational change in real time. We aim to identify fast-forming ATP-binding states in both bacterial and eukaryotic ATP-driven Ca2+ transport, and to monitor how the lipidic environment affect functional structural rearrangements. We will use the same pump-and-probe methodology to track catalysis of nucleotide interconversion, which is central to cellular hemostasis. Here, we aim to determine kinetics and structural dynamics of fast-forming intermediates associated with ATP binding. The results will provide better understanding of lipid-induced membrane transport regulation, cooperative protein dynamics, and significantly increase the number of protein targets for similar time-resolved X-ray studies. ","3320":"COVID-19 affects multiple vital organs and leads to drastic changes in tissue architecture not only in the lung but also in the heart. The understanding of these alterations is currently very limited and no high resolution 3D data is available. We propose to investigate damage in heart and lung tissue from patients having died with COVID-19 and who have undergone autopsy. This will be achieved by X-ray cryo-nano-holotomography. The aim of the proposal is to reveal the 3D changes occurring in tissue at cellular and sub-cellular levels, following terminal COVID-19 infection. ","3322":"Pathological crystallization within the human body is a major cause of diseases like atherosclerotic plaques in arteries, urinary stones, gallstones and\r\nosteoarthritis. As part of our existing research objective to understand pathological crystallisation in the human body, we aim to understand the intricate structural details of gallstones primary composed of cholesterol. In particular, we want to investigate how the 3D orientation of cholesterol and calcium carbonate\/phosphate crystallites relate to the internal structure of the gallstones. In the proposed experiment we aim to utilize state-of-the-art wide-angle X-ray diffraction tensor tomography (XRDTT) to map in 3D the local variations of mineral orientation in gallstones. We expect that the proposed experiments will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of gallstone formation and help establish a correlation between organic cholesterol phase and inorganic components in terms of the local orientational variations.","3323":"Cancer is subtyped according to the presence of certain features such as molecular markers. However, patients with similar levels of key molecular markers exhibit different levels of response or resistance to the same treatment strategy. This project will apply the multi-element Z-tag XRF (MEZ-XRF) imaging method we developed in a prior beamtime at ID15A, to reveal not only single-cell marker expression within a tissue, but the subcellular location of these molecules in key cell populations (spatial context that informs cell function\/dysfunction). Specifically, we will use MEZ-XRF to study if subcellular context underlies why only some human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancers respond to targeted treatment. Only MEZ-XRF can efficiently image the multiplicity of markers across spatial scales this question requires, the results of which, will have implications for future HER2+ breast cancer diagnostic and therapeutic development.","3324":" The current proposal focuses on the structural determination via XRPD of nano\/micro-crystalline proteins and complexes associated with diseases and epidemics, which are or will become a threat to public health. XRPD allows for studies of low quality crystals, polymorph screening and time-resolved studies. The proteins that we will study are: (a) Microcrystalline protein drugs against diabetes: Insulin-ligand complexes & insulin analogues for improving drug delivery & formulation. (b) Target proteins of newly emerging viruses for drug design. Concerning drug delivery, microcrystalline samples will be produced and characterized upon variation of their physicochemical environment. We focus on pH, humidity and oxidative stress mimicking in vivo conditions.","3325":"The aim of this project is an external and internal morphological study of key amber beetle fossils by direct observation (for external morphology) and virtual dissection (for internal structures) using propagation phase contrast synchrotron X-ray microtomography. Critical data obtained from fossils by these methods will be integrated into the interdisciplinary investigation of the biggest animal evolutionary radiation, the phylogeny of Coleoptera Staphylinoidea. This is a continuation of EC530 and LS 2248.","3326":"Comparative jawed-vertebrate hard-tissue microstructural dataset.","3327":"The ear is a complex biomechanical system dedicated to sound perception, even though part of the auditory function is located in the central nervous system. The evolution of a tympanic ear has been a key innovation in solving the impedance problem between air and biological tissues allowing sound to reach the inner ear. The coupling between the two middle ear cavities has an effect on the directionality of the eardrum, which acts as a pressure difference sensor. We aim at identifying and quantifying in detail the tympanum structures related to sound perception. We will use nanotomography as a basis for the construction of a highresolution three-dimensional dataset. Such 3D models and comparisons between data obtained for 20 samples of species varying in their frequency response should enable the understanding of the biomechanical basis of hearing very high frequency sounds.","3328":"Recent studies have shown that pineal gland (PG) dysfunction, due to PG volume reduction and PG calcification, is involved in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this framework, we propose the investigation of the PG soft tissue and calcification from post-mortem human brains in norm and AD pathology on the cell level, using X-ray holographic nano-tomography for a comparative study. This research will allow us to evaluate the degree of involvement of the human pineal gland in the development of AD.","3329":" In the ocean, microalgae can live inside host cells and establish a mutualistic interaction. This partnership is abundant in waters where trace metals are poorly available yet essential for the metabolism of the microalgae. Metal S-XRF mapping is currently based on 2D resin sections of non-native cells (i.e. osmium staining), thus offering a limited understanding of metal distribution. Therefore, this proposal aims to unveil and quantify the metal distribution in free-living and symbiotic microalgae, and so in 3D and in native state. Correlated X-ray phase-contrast and XRF tomography will superimpose cellular compartments of cells and metals distribution, which is essential to understand how key metals are compartmentalized in symbiotic cells (e.g. Fe, Mn, Cu). This project will improve our knowledge of the role of metals in oceanic symbiosis and will pave the way for more investigations on other cell-cell interactions (e.g. pathogens, viruses) and in toxicology.","3330":"This proposal aims at investigating the intracellular concentration and subcellular localization of antimicrobial compounds into Gram-negative bacteria in respect with their envelope permeability.\r\nIn Gram-negative bacteria, envelope permeability defects are responsible for the limited accumulation of antibacterial drugs, which is a significant contributing factor to their limited antibacterial activity. \r\nThis proposal is based on using correlative 3D cryo X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging approaches to specifically localize and quantify antibiotic-metal complexes, as novel antibacterial probes, within Escherichia coli cells, as Gram-negative models, at nanoscale resolution. The obtained data will provide unique quantitative 3D of antibacterial drugs in single cells and an invaluable proof of concept for the development of new antibacterial drugs.\r\n","3331":"Organisms highly concentrate certain elements from their environment. Far less about this is known in unicellular eukaryotes (= protists) than in multicellular organisms, although protists constitute the majority of eukaryotic diversity. We have found large amount of celestine (SrSO4) with admixtures of barite (BaSO4) crystals enclosed in vacuoles of unicellular marine protists belonging to the group Diplonemidae. Micro-XRF in frozen-hydrated intact cells will allow artefact-free intracellular localization of Sr and Ba or celestine and barite (e.g. in cytoplasm, vacuoles, cell surface incrustations etc.), with much better resolution and quantification than previous EDX analyses of diplonemids. Furthermore, assessing intraspecific and intrastagial differences in their distribution and morphology will hint to the uptake, formation and function of celestine and barite. We believe that such an in-depth study of these elements in eukaryotic cells is unprecedented.","3332":"Using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) nano-imaging at ID16A we have previously revealed the functions of Zn and Cu in the cytoskeletal architecture of hippocampal neurons. This result shed a new light on the understanding of Zn and Cu contribution to fundamental neuronal processes such as the morphological plasticity of the synapse. Now we would like to explore if this mechanism applies more generally to other cellular systems. We will use the same methodological approach, validated with neurons, and correlate 40 nm resolution nano-SXRF imaging of element distributions with 40 nm STED (stimulated emission depletion) super resolution imaging of cytoskeletal proteins. Primary human fibroblasts and rat astrocytes will be labelled with silicon-rhodamine tubulin and F-actin fluorogenic probes designed for STED microscopy. The co-localization of Zn with tubulin and Cu with actin would place Zn and Cu at the heart of broad biological processes such as cell differentiation and division.","3333":"Cable bacteria are filamentous, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that evolved a unique protein structure to transport electrons over centimeter-scale distances. This protein structure consists of parallel conductive fibers that run along the length of the filament. Previous experiments show that conductive fibers are enriched in nickel and sulfur. It is theorized that the fibers are composed of a novel metalloprotein containing a sulfur-ligated nickel complex. The distribution of these Ni\/S groups in the conductive fibers, their molecular structure and their role in the electron transport mechanism remain unknown.\r\nWe seek to create high-resolution 2D and 3D elemental maps of cable bacteria cells and the isolated protein structure to map the distribution of Ni\/S groups in the individual fibers. Ni K-edge XANES spectra will provide additional structural information on the metal group. This dual approach will improve our understanding of long-distance electron transport in cable bacteria.","3335":"Nature is known to form a variety of  complex architectures with exquisite structural control. These include 2D mesoporous silica structures found in the cell walls of diatoms and 3D mesoporous crystalline calcite structures found in the cysts of some dinoflagellates. Both examples exhibit long-range morphological regularity, which is beyond the reach of current human technology. In the proposed experiment, we will apply nano-holotomography imaging method to follow the morphological evolution of commonly studied model species of diatoms and dinoflagellates with the goal of: (i) understanding the forces and thermodynamic constraints that govern the formation of highly regular 2D and 3D mesoporous biomineralized structures (morphogenesis); and (ii) correlating between the morphology and the mechanical performance of these architectures (function).","3336":"The main aim of this proposal is to study how the osteblasic differentiation stimuli affect the maturation process of mineral depositions released by\r\n osteosarcoma SaOS2 cells at 4 and 10 days after the osteoblastic induction. To this purpose we will use \u00b5XANES at the Ca K-edges to obtain the chemical\r\n speciation of mineral depositions since Ca is one the constitutive and pivotal element of hexagonal hydroxyapatite crystal present in bone. This study will\r\n contribute to unveil the genesis of bone mineralization process in osteosarcoma which is still far from to be elucidated. Moreover, this research is a part of a larger\r\n project aimed to validate a new anticancer strategy, based on the differentiation of osteosarcoma cells towards a less aggressive phenotype. The application of\r\n this strategy will be fundamental to improve the chance to translate the new knowledge in osteosarcoma clinical practice and treatment.","3337":"Iron (Fe) is essential cofactor in various physiological processes such as the operation of the photosynthetic functions. In Planta, Fe content of leaves also serves as Fe source during senescence processes. Retranslocation of Fe is connected to the alteration in the regulation of chloroplast Fe homeostasis. Our data (Pham et al, 2020, S\u00e1gi-Kaz\u00e1r et al, under peer-review) indicate that regulation of the chloroplast Fe homeostasis and senescence processes are in a close interaction. The understanding they way and reasons of Fe remodelling may provide a basis for the development of better foliar Fe application and biofortification techniques. With the help of single point \u03bcXANES we could determine any possible chemical modifications in the Fe content of chloroplasts as well as that of mesophyll cells in the areas of interest. Data are essential for the proper interpretation of ou molecular biological information.","3338":"We have recently characterised, using time-resolved USAXS and SAXS data at ID021, the kinetics of the structural changes in the cardiac thick filament during the unitary mechanical response elicited by electrical stimulation of an intact cardiac trabecula at constant length. In particular we determined the structure, dynamics and function of the myosin motor domains in different regions of the thick filament during contraction. Now we propose to investigate the effect of myosin-targeting drugs on the dynamics of the regulatory structural changes of the myosin filament that control the rates of contraction and relaxation in electrically paced isolated intact cardiac trabeculae.","3339":"Development of novel therapies to combat muscle weakness in disease and in the elderly has been limited by poor understanding of the normal mechanisms of regulation of muscle contraction. Synchrotron-based small angle X-ray scattering provides a uniquely powerful approach to investigate these mechanisms at the molecular level in intact muscles on the physiological timescale. The upgraded ID02 with the Eiger 2-4M detector currently offers the best facility worldwide to determine the regulatory structural changes in the myosin-containing thick filaments following single action potential stimulation of isolated mammalian muscles in physiological conditions, and their dependence on muscle load. No previous study has looked at thick filament mechano-sensing in mammalian muscle during physiological activation by a single action potential. The results will establish a structural and functional framework for testing small molecules as potential therapeutics for muscle weakness in man.","3340":"Bone consists primarily of mineralized collagen fibrils arranged in specific patterns. It is traversed by a network of cells housed in lacunae interconnected by few-hundred-nanometer wide canaliculi. The organic matrix around the osteocyte network differs from that further away, but limited knowledge is available about the mineral phase. We hypothesize that it differs in orientation and possibly in other crystallographic properties. This is based on preliminary data that, however, did not have sufficient resolution to fully test the hypothesis due to insufficient flux. With the EBS, we aim to test the hypothesis by scanning XRD\/XRF on thin slices of bone since the EBS is expected to have sufficient flux to allow this challenging experiment. The osteocyte network is vast and proving how its associated mineral is organized will have importance for bone mechanics and diseases in bone turnover.","3341":"The remarkable colors of many animals are produced by the interaction of light with periodic arrays of guanine crystals. These arrays are formed by specialized cells in which remarkable control over crystal morphology and assembly is obtained using strategies that are beyond the state of the art in materials science. How animals template and regulate the formation of these structures remained largely unknown. Here we propose to study the guanine crystals and the chitin-based frameworks of the Sapphirinia metallina copepod, a small planktonic crustacean, to uncover the strategies used by these animals to produce a remarkably ordered array of crystals. We will do so by scanning SAXS\/ XRF of copepods cross-sections, to map the structure and composition of the intracellular chitin-frameworks. Additionally, we will WAXS to follow the orientation of the guanine crystals,  to determine the structural variations which facilitate the change in the crystal periodicities during color change.","3342":"Molluscan shells are a model system to study the most fundamental principles of biomineralization. Various shell structures are different in terms of their size, crystallography, shape and calcium carbonate polymorph of their mineral building blocks. Here, we propose to analyze pattern formation in the most common crossed shell architectures. Crossed-lamellar and cross-foliated structures, are unique architectures where the mineral building units are assembled to form crystallographically coherent domains. These domains evolve to form complex spatial configurations separated by twin-like abrupt changes in crystallographic texture. Astonishingly, in the case of molluscs, these domains can only be distinguished by the crystallographic orientation of the mineral units that comprise them. Following the evolution of the crossed patterns using 3D-XRD in ID13 will allow us to quantify the process of their formation in time and in space.","3343":"Living organisms form a variety of mineralized architectures with exquisite structural control through the process of biomineralization. In addition to the ability to control the morphology, crystallinity and polymorphism of the mineral building blocks that comprise the extraordinary variety of 3D architectures found in nature, some species possess the unique capacity to form single-crystal-like but highly branched assemblies. In this proposed experiment, we aim to test the hypothesis that organisms employ screw dislocations to direct the growth of extremely complex but symmetric singe-crystalline entities. Here, Bragg-CDI (BCDI) experiments will be employed to identify and localize these dislocations in the crystalline endoskeleton of a number of species, thus establishing dislocation-driven crystal growth as key mechanism in controlled morphogenesis of intricate extracellular biological materials.  ","3344":"Toxicity\/carcinogenicity of Fe-bearing mineral fibers has been proposed to be driven by a complex and subtle relation between the total Fe amount and the structural, coordinative, and oxidative states of the Fe sites. However, the specific conditions that make Fe sites able to induce free radical generation are not clear yet. Here, we propose to perform a complete structural characterization of Fe in Asbestos Fibers (AF) and Asbestos Bodies (AB, i.e. asbestos fibers with the Fe-coating they develop in biological tissues) retrieved from lung tissues with an innovative, non-invasive method. The local and medium range structural environment of Fe bulk sites will be revealed by Fe K-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray Pair Distribution Function (XPDF), respectively. The proposed combined XAS-XPDF experiment will complement single crystal nano-X-ray Diffraction measurements on single AF and AB to be performed at ID11@ESRF, for which beamtime has already been granted.","3346":"Our proposal combines structural and functional information about brain networks and how they change in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The goals are to collect high-resolution whole-brain datasets using hard X-ray nano-tomography, and to combine these data with our whole-brain functional datasets. Our initial data collection successfully generated structural data from seven individual animals, which we have linked to the corresponding brain-wide activity in these animals' brains. In this continuation, we aim to complete our dataset with additional animals and developmental ages. This will allow the confirmation and further characterisation of the phenotype that we have observed, and will produce the necessary data for using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to detect subtle structural phenotypes in our models of ASD. ","3348":"Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process distinct from normal ageing by the presence of Senile Plaques composed of Abeta peptide. Dendrimers have been shown to possess properties as antiamyloidogenic agent. Maltose modified dendrimers decorated with histidine\u2019s (DG4-His-Mal) are nanoparticles that prevent APP\/PS1 transgenic mice from developing cognitive deficit and \u03bcFTIR studies have shown that DG4-His-Mal reduce the formation of early aggregates and fibrils in the cortex. To improve this effect, we have administered DG4-His-Mal encapsulated in liposomes to 5xFAD transgenic mice (model for AD). The experiment is still on going, however, the midterm cognitive test show that DG4-His-Mal and liposomes alone improve the performance in cognitive test and have a synergic effect when administered together in AD transgenic mice. To understand the effects of these treatments we will combine histochemical analysis, with \u03bcFTIR (amyloid structure) and nXRF f(metal distribution).","3350":"The efficiency of the heart as a pump depends on an auto-regulatory mechanism, called length-dependent activation (LDA), that potentiates the strength of contraction in response to an increase in ventricular filling. Despite decades of investigation, the molecular basis of LDA in cardiac muscle is still unclear. Here we propose to use X-ray diffraction at the upgraded beamline ID02 to investigate the structural changes in the myofilaments induced by stretch in relaxed and partially calcium-activated demembranated cardiac trabeculae in near-physiological conditions. Because the disruption of LDA is a common pathogenic mechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction, the results of this research will provide new targets and assays for the development of new pharmacological approaches to treat heart failure in cardiac diseases. ","3351":"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins has attracted a wide attention in the biological and biophysical community. We suggest to investigate the kinetics of the LLPS of the intrinsically disordered myelin basic protein (MBP) and connected structural changes of the protein using time-resolved (TR) USAXS\/ SAXS at ID02 with the stopped flow technique. MBP is essential for the integrity of myelin sheaths ensuring flawless neuronal signal propagation and it is assumed that LLPS is necessary for its physiological function.\r\nWe propose to use 3 detector distances to investigate a q-range of 1\u221910^-3 - 5\u221910^0 1\/nm in order to observe internal protein structure, droplet nucleation and droplet growth evolution. Our proposed experiments take 60 hours of pure X-ray beamtime, so we believe that 3 days of beamtime are necessary considering extra time required to set up the device, do cleaning, test-shots, find suitable exposure times and radiation intensities.","3352":"Development of novel therapies to combat muscle weakness in disease and in the elderly is limited by poor understanding of the normal mechanisms of regulation of muscle contraction. Synchrotron-based small angle X-ray scattering is the most powerful technique to elucidate these mechanisms at the molecular level in intact muscles on the physiological timescale, and the upgraded ID02 beamline with Eiger 2-4M detector is currently the best facility worldwide for such studies. In this proposal we will use time-resolved X-ray diffraction and interference to determine the time course of the activation and deactivation of both the thick and thin filaments during contraction of slow-twitch muscles in near-physiological conditions, and the effect of mechanical load on the activation time courses. The results will reveal mechanisms of thick and thin filament activation in skeletal muscle, an essential step towards design and screening of novel therapeutics for muscle weakness.","3353":"Regulation of muscle contraction is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing  filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin. Thick filament mechanosensing  adapts to the load the number of motors switched ON from the resting (OFF) state. In the heartbeat the internal [Ca2+] does not saturate and both Ca-sensitivity and thick filament mechanosensing are under the control of several modulatory mechanisms, like the degree of phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. Using X-ray diffraction on intact heart trabeculae we study the role of the sarcomeric proteins in the interfilament communication and in the mechanosensing that control the systolic performance and cause its dysregulation in cardiomyopathies, and test the effect of small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3354":"Substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) mediate the uptake of nutrients into a bacterial cell, which is known to critically depend on the conformational state of the\r\nproteins.\r\nAnomalous small-angle x-ray scattering (ASAXS) applied to biological macromolecules site-specifically labeled with small (~1.4 nm in diameter) gold nanoparticles provides a powerful molecular ruler. The ASAXS ruler approach gives precise and absolute information on the full distance distribution of the gold labels with \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m-precision. However, its potential to reveal conformational states of proteins has not been demonstrated yet.\r\nDuring our previous beamtime (LS-2945) we successfully measured the distances between pairs of gold labels attached to two maltose binding protein (MalE) mutants. We want to now build on these very promising results and continue this project to demonstrate the full potential of the technology and also monitor the full ensemble involved in the conformational changes.","3355":"We aim to observe structural perturbations in microtubules using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) in response to an applied electric field. In earlier studies at the Swiss Light Source we observed very subtle changes in the SAXS scattering pattern when weak electric fields (approximately 9 V amplitude) oscillating at 20 GHz were applied across microtubule slurries. Here we intend to look for larger structural perturbations using much stronger electric fields (up to 400 V amplitudes) oscillating at much lower frequencies (in the kHz to MHz domain). This work is fundamental research that links to ongoing debates concerning putative effects of non-ionizing radiation on biological samples. Whereas this debate can sometimes be polarized by public fears, we feel that high-quality experimental data (including null-results) are the appropriate way for scientists to engage in these questions.   ","3356":"Muscle contraction is regulated by both Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation and mechanosensing-based thick filament activation that switches ON the motors in relation to the load. Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in the central one-third and bridges thin and thick filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments, conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in specific proteins. ","3357":"Fibrillar aggregates of Abeta peptides and tau protein are defining features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the role these structures play in the etiology of disease remains uncertain. Outstanding questions remain as to the distribution of polymorphs between and within cases.  The proposed work will apply x-ray scanning micro- and nano-diffraction to histological sections of human brain tissue in order to map the distribution and arrangement of fibrillar aggregates of these proteins in plaques and tangles.  The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that the spatial distribution of structural polymorphs  in brain tissue will provide important clues as to how fibrils contribute to disease.  The results of these studies will provide a preliminary assessment of whether or not different fibrillar polymorphs spread by a prion-like process during disease progression and provide insights into the mechanisms by which different strains are associated with different disease subtypes.","3358":"While spider silk threads mainly consist of a core of partially crystalline silk proteins, it has been found that they also exhibit a very thin skin layer of distinct structure and a coating rich in lipids and glycoproteins. These outer layers are poorly researched, but can be assumed to be a major player governing the interaction of cells with spider silk threads, as observed in cell culture. Here we propose SAXS\/WAXS mapping with ultra-high spatial resolution to examine the surface layer of thin cryo-cut sections of different spider silks that have shown different cell guiding behavior in cell culture. This approach allows studying surface layers from two orientations (along and normal to fiber axis) and the cryo-approach minimizes morphological changes. In a recent nano-SAXS\/WAXS beamtime at ID13, we obtained very promising data, however with whole threads and with lower resolution. This follow-up work aims to characterize the surface layer systematically.","3359":"Photoreceptors regulate the adaptation of living organisms to light. A class of photoreceptors recently discovered uses a vitamin B12 derivative to sense light and regulate the biosynthesis of carotenoids, which protect against photo-oxidative damage. The CarH photoreceptor is a prototype of this class and as it acts as a light-activated transcription regulator it is a promising target for optogenetic applications. We have recently shown that tertiary and quaternary structural changes can be followed in T.  thermophilus (Tt) CarH after light absorption by time-resolved small and wide angle X-ray scattering (Exp. LS-2958). We propose to extend the results of LS-2958 to both a variant and a homolog of TtCarH, where major quaternary changes are prevented. The new results will be essential to disentangle tertiary and quaternary signals in TtCarH thus enabling us to describe the cascade of structural events occurring in native TtCarH in the micro- to millisecond time scale.","3360":"This proposal is part of a larger project that will develop a novel biosensor, based on nanostructured biomimetic lipid membranes, to detect plasma protein biomarkers of severe pathologies. The project will characterise, at the nanoscale, the structure\/function relationship linked to the interaction of protein biomarkers with biologically relevant lipids. These interactions will be investigated by means of scattering techniques using large-scale facilities to optimise the lipid composition for specific biomarker detection.","3362":"The biology of giant vertebrates has long fascinated biologists. However, the mechanisms that dictate the upper limits of animal size are not well understood. The size of an organism affects virtually all aspects of its physiology and ecology. The study of the influence of size on form and function has become a major concern in ecology and evolutionary biology [1]. This study aims to comparatively investigate different models of frogs and toads such as Conraua goliath or Pipa pipa as a model to decipher the influence of size on the form and function (performance) of: 1) the vocal apparatus, 2) hearing (the ear) which plays a crucial role in sexual selection [2]. In addition, we seek to understand the trade-off between the transmitter and receiver of sound. We will use propagation computed tomography (PCT) as a basis for the construction of a high-resolution 3D dataset. These 3D models should help to understand the biomechanical basis of vocal emission and hearing.","3363":"Deep-sea teleost fishes are a major component of oceanic ecosystems and biomass. How their anatomy adapted to this extreme environment is a key evolutionary biology question. In particular, the structure of their bones is proposed to be peculiar to deal with water pressure and the scarcity of resources, but this has not been properly tested because no comparative framework exists on the matter. In this proposal, we aim at building such a framework of comparative fish bone microstructure across deep-sea teleost diversity. We will use established quantitative methods based on \u00b5CT data, to compare bone compactness in a broad range of species. This requires acquiring 3D microtomographic data with enhanced contrast and at a high-throughput, conditions that are ideally met at the ESRF BM18 or BM05 beamlines.","3364":"Conditions on the early Earth were hostile with intense UV radiation, but cells still managed to adapt and thrive. The evolution of new metabolic pathways is the obvious route by which cells coped with environmental pressures, however, the social lives of cells were just as important (West et al. 2007). Cooperation and sociality are the well-known mechanisms for dealing with environmental stress and the evolution of complexity (Durand et al. 2016), but how this played out in the earliest prokaryote groups is unknown. A palaeontological angle to this issue is almost entirely unexplored and represents a huge gap in knowledge. We wish to address this gap, by examining the earliest fossilized evidence of sociality in robust lensoidal to spheroidal microbes. This study will document for the first time the \u201csociobiological aspects\u201d of the unusually large prokaryotes during the Archaean.","3365":"This proposal aims to study 30 specimens of fossilized faeces, known as \u201ccoprolites\u201d, from the Early Triassic of South Africa. Coprolites selectively preserve microfossils and soft tissues, addressing specific taphonomic deficiencies in the fossil record1-4. Additionally, coprolites contain exceptional palaeobiological information, providing a unique palaeoecological window on the diet, feeding behaviours, trophic relationships, parasitism, and digestive systems of extinct organisms. Recent, pioneering research using PPCSRmCT allows for non-destructive investigation of the microstructures and microfossils contained within coprolites. By imaging these coprolites, we can gain information on the microfauna and a preliminary view on ecological recovery in the Early Triassic following the catastrophic end-Permian extinction, when 95% of all species on Earth went extinct. ","3366":"The aim of this project is to study the evolutionary origin of metamorphosis in the amphibian lineage. Lissamphibians (i.e., salamander, frogs, and caecilians) are the only extant tetrapods that metamorphose, but it is still not clear whether metamorphosis is unique of this clade or if it evolved during the Palaeozoic in their putative ancestors, the dissorophoid temnospondyls. To date, metamorphosis cannot be inferred unequivocally for this fossil group because of the lack of complete ontogenetic series. In this project, we propose to infer metamorphosis in temnospondyls in a novel way: testing whether their palatal bones show histological signals of remodelling, a process that occurs in pterygoids and vomers during metamorphosis in salamanders. To do so, we propose to study using synchrotron x-ray imaging the ontogenetic changes in cranial bones at the histological level in a range of salamander taxa with different life cycles and compare them to key temnospondyl species. ","3367":"The evolution of the head, jaws, and pharynx of vertebrates has been an intense focus of study over the last two centuries due to its important functional role as well as its implications for the evolutionary success of Vertebrata. We propose to target this part of the skeleton in two early shark-like fishes which have played an iconic part in these studies: Cladoselache and Acanthodes. Synchrotron propagation phase contrast radiation microtomography  (PPC-\u00b5CT) will allow us to visualize the three-dimensional structure of the head, jaws, and branchial arches in uniquely well preserved specimens, providing unprecedented detailed information on the anatomy of the head of two of the earliest cartilaginous fishes.\r\n","3368":"We propose to determine the three-dimensional (3d) network of muscle fibers in entire large animal hearts\r\nusing propagation-based phase-contrast tomography. The primary goal is to reconstruct and to analyze the\r\n3d vector field of myofibril orientations in large animal (pig, monkey), and in future ultimately human\r\nheart. Building upon our recent studies of small animal (murine) models, we will use an established fiber\r\ntracking algorithm which operates on high-resolution reconstructions of the electron density. Furthermore,\r\nwe will determine the cardiac network of different cell types comprising cardiomyocytes, vessels,\r\nfibroblasts and the intrinsic cardiac nervous system. ","3369":"Amongst reptiles, complex, filamentous integumentary structures are present as feathers and pycnofibers in Ornithodira (birds, non-avian dinosaurs, and\r\npterosaurs). Several exceptionally preserved and undescribed specimens of a non-ornithodiran stem-diapsid reptile from Gr\u00e8s \u00e0 Voltzia (Anisian, Middle Triassic) of northeastern France exhibit remarkable integumentary structures, as well as a complete skull and postcranium. We propose to use propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SR\u03bcCT) to investigate the anatomy of both its integumentary structures and skeleton. This will allow us to describe the new species, determine its evolutionary position in the reptile tree, and analyse the function of the integumentary structures to decide between two competing hypotheses: (a) an aerial gliding mechanism or (b) an elaborate display structure. This study will have wide-ranging implications for our understanding of filamentous body covering in reptiles.","3370":"Narwhals are unique and poorly understood animals. Their tusk has a spiral macrostructure with highly anisotropic mechanical properties. The formation of the chiral tusk is not understood and the origin of this amazing biological structure thus remains elusive. Therefore, we propose to conduct high energy multiscale X-ray imaging of the tusk formation centre in both emerging and embedded tusk, the latter being the tusk that does not exit the skull to become an external dentition. We will image ~30 cm high, 10 cm diameter volumes at 25 \u00b5m supplemented by higher resolution images of selected subregions. This will allow revealing the enigmatic tusk formation mechanisms.","3371":"Genetic inactivation of the type II deiodinase gene (dio2) involved in thyroid signaling results in hypothyroidism and is associated with developmental defects in zebrafish. Observation of the heart region in this mutant contrasts strongly with that of a wild-type animal, suggesting a cardiac hypertrophy, a hypothesis supported by gene expression and immunological data.\r\nTo better characterize the morphological differences induced in zebrafish organs, in particular the heart, our aim is to use X-ray phase contrast technology on whole zebrafish to image body with sufficient resolution to obtain a good view of the morphology of the heart in dio2 mutants compared to wild type sibling fishes. Our goal is 1) to observe the heart in an in situ context and measure the volume, shape and position of the heart in these animals, 2) to determine the precise topography (e.g. barycenter analysis) of the organs relative to each other to assess the effects of the mutation on the whole animal.","3372":"The development of internal strains in the bone are one of the key parameters when studying osseointegration and post-implantation pain. The success and longevity of the implantation process depends on it. In that context, the requested time slot will be used to assess for the displacements induced during the implant insertion process, in order to estimate the strains developed in the peri-implant bone. It is assumed that the strains experienced by the bone around a self-tapping implant are different from those experienced around an implant whose shaft is pre-tapped. The aim of this study is hence to investigate the difference in peri-implant bone strains development around both types of implants. ","3373":"Osteoarthritis is a major financial, social and healthcare burden. Our previous research has identified associations between growth plate cartilage phenotypes and osteoarthritis development. Further, we have developed new synchrotron X-ray imaging (sCT) technologies to allow determination of nanoscale mechanical strains in intact joints under loading using a unique mechanical loading rig (P2R). Here we will build on this work and examine our hypothesis that: growth plate cartilage dynamics and joint biomechanical functionality are intimately linked. We will apply loads to  young, adult and aged osteoarthritis-prone (STR\/Ort mice) and healthy (CBA wild-type mice) intact joints using the P2R and examine the subsequent strain patterns using our unique digital volume correlation code. We will then correlate these to hierarchical anatomical changes in joint tissue structures, to determine their interplay with the mechanical behaviour, and how these may underpin osteoarthritis development.","3374":"The recent discovery of direct and indirect glutamatergic communication between neurons and a subpopulation of brain tumour cells that drive brain tumour progression in high-grade pediatric and adult gliomas as well as breast cancer brain metastases shows the importance of neuronal activity on brain tumour progression. Mapping these interactions across whole tumors with correlative phase contrast imaging and light microscopy to create a tumor cell atlas will advance our understanding of glioma pathophysiology and help craft novel approaches to target this intractable disease.","3375":"Microstructural change in the internal porous structure of foods during deep-frying is one of the main factors affecting the amount of oil in the final product. Understanding these changes with coupled information of water and oil movement during the process are important in establishing a connect between subsequent time-dependent material property changes. Laboratory based X-ray \u00b5CT has been used to characterize microstructure of fried potato starch at different time intervals, however contrast was not sufficient to visualize water inside the starch matrix. Furthermore, due to limited time resolution and other constraints, capturing pore formation and oil uptake has not been possible. The frying process of model food systems will be visualized through ultrafast synchrotron X-ray microtomography aimed at revealing spatio-temporal distribution of water and oil in the food matrix. Dynamic imaging will provide critical insight into structural changes and fluid flow inside food matrix.","3376":"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers with a prognosis for most patients of six-month survival period. This has encouraged the exploration of some organometallic complexes in this area. Recent research show  that often they target the mitochondrial system or inhibit kinases or redox proteins overexpressed in cancer cells. We have discovered  a succinimido-ferrociphenol iron-based compound with an exceptional antitumoral effect on various type of cancers, particulalrly pancreatic ones. We could also confirm its potential in vivo in glioma or murine xenografted-melanoma when it is loaded  in lipid nanocapsules. It is thus essential considering the pharmacological potential of this organometallic compound to understand the intracellular targets and pathway of this ferrociphenol in aggressive pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 cells. We expect to unravel it through 3D correlative optical fluorescence microscopy and X-ray fluorescence nanoimaging at ID16A.","3377":"Understanding antibiotic resistance is of urgent need and a current global problem. We study the use of nitroxoline (Nx) as an antibiotic against multi-drug bacteria. Our recent results show that Nx treatment perturbs metal homeostasis in Gram-negative bacteria by acting as an ionophore that drags distinct metals inside the cell, which leads to metal intoxiciaction and subsequent cell death. Consistent with this model, iron, zinc and manganese are significantly elevated in Nx exposed E. coli cells. However, currently there is no information on the metal localization in Nx treated cells. We hypothesize that certain metals (especially Fe, Zn, Mn) are not evenly distributed but stored in specific regions as shown for other bacteria. To address this question, we would like to use X-ray fluorescence nano-imaging in E. coli under Nx treatment and control conditions. This approach will be crucial to reveal the metal accumulation within the cells and elucidate the mode of action of Nx. ","3379":"X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT) allows 3D visualization of disease-relevant vascular and neuronal networks within central nervous system tissue, but the technique has limitations in the univocal identification of disease-relevant cells. We intend to boost XPCT to a higher level equipping it with nanotechnology solutions by combining two nanocomponents, metal nanoparticles (NPs) and cell marker-specific nanobodies (single-chain antibodies) so providing detailed image of the whole organ, with imaging at the cellular level, identifying the relevant cells via an immunohistochemistry-type approach.\r\nWe propose to perform Holo-tomography and Xray Fluorescence experiment to validate this new imaging approach. The data will be correlated with planned and performed above and below K-edge measurements.\r\n","3380":"Manganese (Mn) is both an essential nutrient and a neurotoxic element. High Mn content in drinking water has been associated with lower intelligence quotient and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders. Although there is growing concern about the developmental neurotoxicity of Mn, it has only recently begun to be explored.\r\nWe hypothesize that astrocytes can protect neurons from Mn toxicity by protecting synapses, whereas when astrocytic protection is overwhelmed, Mn can reach synapses, presumably through competition with Ca signaling pathways. X-ray fluorescence microscopy will enable to map and quantify Mn distribution in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes. Primary rat hippocampal neurons will be cultured alone, or with astrocytes and exposed to non-toxic or toxic Mn concentrations. We expect a reduced Mn content in neurons cultured with astrocytes. We will elucidate if Mn reaches the synaptic compartments when the astrocytic protection is overpassed at high Mn exposure levels.","3381":"In eukaryotes, calcium (Ca2+) is a key secondary messenger that regulates diverse physiological processes. Abiotic and biotic stress, such as pathogen attacks, osmotic or oxidative stress, result in an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, which empowers an immediate signal transduction pathway. In this contest, in plants, changes in light regimes have been described to generate Ca2+ transients in the cytosol followed by a long lasting wave in the chloroplast. For phytoplanktonic cells, light play a pivotal role on their survival and for the chimeric diatoms (key component of the phytoplankton, originated by a secondary endosymbiosis, in contrast to plants) we suggest an alternative Ca2+ signaling pathways from those identified so far. This proposal aims at unveiling the natural subcellular distribution of Ca2+ in diatoms using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) and to assess the element requirements during light acclimation.","3382":"A healthy heart produces a stronger contraction in response to increased venous filling, a response known as the Frank-Starling relationship. Despite decades of investigation at the cellular level, the molecular basis of this so-called \u201clength-dependent activation\u201d (LDA) in cardiac muscle is still unclear. Here we will use a combination of mechanical protocols and small-angle X-ray diffraction at ID02 on electrically paced muscle tissue isolated from the rat heart to determine the dynamic structural changes in the constituent myosin and actin filaments induced by an increase in muscle length during the relaxed phase of the cardiac cycle. Disruption of LDA is a common pathogenic mechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction: the results of this research will provide new targets and assays for the development of new pharmacological approaches to treat heart failure in cardiac diseases. ","3383":"This proposal will use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to determine the contribution of novel regulatory mechanisms in the myosin-containing thick filaments in fast-twitch skeletal muscles of mammals to the performance of those muscles in response to changes in external load. The protocols will mimic the normal functions of human skeletal muscles in everyday life, providing the fundamental mechanistic understanding to underpin the development of novel therapies for muscle weakness. The ID02 beamline with Eiger 2-4M detector is uniquely suitable worldwide to determine the relevant molecular structural changes in isolated muscle.","3384":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3385":"Synthetic gas (syngas) is an alternative source of energy to paliate\u00ac\u00ac\u00ac\u00ac the coming fossil fuel shortage. Syngas can be converted into synthetic fuels or commodity products, using the reaction of water gaz shift reaction. Some Hydrogenic carboxydotrophic bacteria e.g. Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans are able to use CO as the sole energy source and provide Bio-WGSR. In this case, the reaction is catalyzed by a multienzyme complex: the oxidation of CO to CO2, catalyzed by a Nickel-dependent carbon monoxide dehydrogenase called CODH. In the case of ChCODH, little is known about the biogenesis of its catalytic site, except that nickel insertion is a key step in the enzyme activation. The crucial step of Ni atom insertion, known as CODH activation, requires two nickel-binding proteins: the nickel-dependent ATPase CooC and an additional nickel chaperones CooT. Our team is studying the maturation process of CODH for the optimization of bio-WGSR. ","3386":"Muscle contraction is regulated by both Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation and mechanosensing-based thick filament activation that switches ON the motors in relation to the load. Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in its central one-third and bridges thin and thick filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments, conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in\r\nspecific proteins.","3387":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most serious human pathogens with more > 0.8 million people dying yearly from chronic HBV. Empty HBV capsids made of truncated subunits containing the N-terminal 149 residues (Cp149) can be assembled in vitro. Compounds binding at the interfaces between subunits, also known as CpAMs for capsid assembly modulators, disrupt the assembly pathway. They are powerful inhibitors of HBV replication in vitro and several are in advanced clinical trials. The objective of the proposal is to elucidate the assembly pathways of Cp149 capsids in the presence of CpAMs. The pathways are probed by time-resolved SAXS (TR-SAXS) and the structure of intermediate species extracted by custom-made algorithms. In a first proposal, we thus performed the first TR-SAXS study of capsid assembly in the presence of antivirals. In this continuation proposal, we will apply this methodology to a new and very promising class of CpAMs.","3388":"Cachexia is an uncurbable syndrome associated to many chronic diseases, such as cancer, characterized by severe muscle wasting and impaired muscle function, which ultimately affects survival and patients\u2019 quality of life. The latter is due to unknown mechanisms beyond the well documented disruption of the contractile myofibers. In this framework, we propose to use X-ray micro diffraction (\u03bcXRD) to observe quantitative and qualitative alterations of the muscle fibres structure and organization in cachexia as compared to controls. ","3389":"The enthesis is the biological site where tendon attaches to bone. It is thus of great importance for biomechanical load transfer and achieves the task of interfacing bone and tendon through a highly optimized nanostructure and mineralization strategy. The nanostructure is actively formed in response to the prevailing load conditions. A chronic change of the enthesis\u2019 load conditionsleads to structural remodeling which alters the mechanical properties. Understanding these structural changes and coupling them to the mechanical properties is essential to optimize prophylactic and rehabilitative medical procedures.\r\nThis experiment aims at characterizing the nanostructure and mineralization of the enthesis by scanning SAXS\/WAXS and XRF. By studying the Achilles tendon enthesis (ATE) of freely-moving mice and hindlimb-unloaded mice, this experiment addresses the question how mechanical unloading impacts the enthesis nanostructure.\r\n","3390":"Silk ribbons spun by recluse (or brown) spiders (Loxosceles), orb-weaving spiders  and silkworm fibers are all semicrystalline beta-sheet materials. Loxosceles silk differs, however,  from these silks in its proposed hierarchical structural organization, although mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength) are comparable. Indeed, spiders and silkworm fibers  crystallinet nanodomains  assemble with disordered protein spacers into cylindrical nanofibrils of 5-6 nm diameter, forming nanofibrillar bundles. Loxosceles ribbons show, however, anisotropic nanofibrils of 5-9 nm thickness and 20 nm width, forming a lauered structure. The ribbonsd tensile properties correspond to the average of tensile properties of the nanofibrils while  modelling of spider silk suggests mesoscale chain confinement for optimized mechanical properties. Here, we here propose a systematic study of the hierarchical structural organization for single Loxosceles ribbons by scanning nanobeam SAXS\/WAXS.","3391":"We propose a scanning diffraction study targeting the molecular structure in cultured heart tissue (pig model), to evaluate the development of cultured cardiac tissue which is kept in a novel setup where the tissue can be subjected to different mechanical loads as well as electrical pacing rates, optogenetic or biochemical\/pharmaceutical signals[1]. Recent progress in the group of co-proposer T. Br\u00fcgmann has allowed to keep slices of pig heart tissue in culture for several days, and to use this setup to address questions in cardiac electrophysiology, vegetative physiology and to explore new treatment options including optogenetic termination of cardiac arrhythmia [2,3]. In this proposal, we want to use SAXS with highly brilliant radiation and scanning X-ray diffraction with micro-focused undulator radiation to evaluate the changes of the cultured slices over time and as a function of mechanical loading (prestress, mechanical stimulation).","3392":"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many critical cellular processes. We will use laser-induced release from a caged, inactive form of ATP followed by short X-ray pulses at the dedicated time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) beamline ID09 at ESRF-EBS to study protein conformational change in real time. We aim to track domain movements involved in regulation of membrane protein transporters critical to human health. The pump-and-probe methodology will determine: 1.) kinetics and structural dynamics of a human Ca2+ ATPase that regulates beating of the heart; 2.) lipid regulatory effects on domain movements in Ca2+ transport; 3.) structural dynamics of regulatory internal domains in Cu+ transport. The results will provide better understanding of membrane transport regulation and cooperative dynamics in biologically important proteins, and significantly increase the number of protein targets for similar time-resolved X-ray studies.","3394":"Prohibitin (PHB) is a heterodimer forming a multimeric ring in the intermembrane space at the inner mitochondrial membrane. PHB  directs the cell\u2019s energy production. Each of the two PHBs has an N-terminal helix thought to anchor the protein to the membranes. Our aim is to characterize the anchoring of PHB to the membrane by studying the two peptides corresponding to the intermembrane sequences of the dimer. Preliminary results collected showed the importance of lipid membrane composition in particular cardiolipin (CL, present at high concentration in mitochondrial membranes), but led to 3 unexpected findings: a seemingly opposite action of both N-terminal helices, slow kinetics of interaction, and concentration-threshold effects. The X-ray reflectivity experiment we propose for ID10 will (i) locate and quantify the 2 N-terminal helices in the membrane at various incubation times, (ii) elucidate possible synergisms between the peptides and (iii) resolve the role of CL.","3395":"Living organisms form a variety of mineralized architectures with exquisite structural control having the ability to control the crystallinity and polymorphism of the mineral building blocks. Some species possess the unique capacity to induce anisotropic growth of mineral single-crystals and to control their final morphology. This is exemplified in the case of calcite, which  is expected to grow as a perfect rhombohedral crystal having identical symmetry-related {104} facets, yet some species of unicellular algae, termed coccolithophores, are able to break the thermodynamically induced symmetry and morph calcite into the most intricate shapes. We aim to test the hypothesis that organisms employ residual elastic strains to direct the growth of biogenic singe-crystalline entities. Bragg-CDI experiments will be employed to map, localize and identify lattice distortions in two coccolithophore species, thus establishing a mechanism for morphogenetic control of biogenic single-crystals.  \r\n","3396":"Solid assemblies of organic compounds often include some inevitable misfit between constituents, giving rise to geometric frustration. In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favorable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the molecular constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. Here, we will apply the BCDI method to follow the evolution of lattice distortions in a slender protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also demonstrate the role of spontaneous processes in biological tissue formation.","3397":"The overall aim of the project is deciphering structures and reaction mechanisms of different cofactor proteins. In situ studies using single-crystal UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy is inevitable to both prove and trap different redox states and to monitor the potential X-ray radiation damage of cofactor proteins. The project focus on both developing this type of combination setups, and to obtain the true redox structure of different cofactor enzymes.","3398":"The current study is focused on the structural determination and characterization of crystalline proteins and their complexes presenting interest for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals, with the aim of structure-based drug design for enhanced and long-lasting action against diseases and epidemics. The experimental method to be employed is XRPD, which allows polymorph identification and extraction of structural information from low quality polycrystalline samples, grown under different physicochemical conditions. We mainly focus on the effect of factors as pH and organic ligands, to simulate in vivo conditions. The main biological macromolecules that we will study are: (i) Human Insulin (HI) and its complexes with various ligands, for the ongoing exploration of a detailed phase map, which is crucial for the development of improved drug formulations and (ii) virus proteins, which are actively being studied in search of efficient inhibitors, but have proven difficult to crystallize.","3399":"This proposal focuses on the synergistic use of serial crystallography and powder diffraction for extracting domain size and strain estimates and phase weight estimates from microcrystalline protein powders. Serial diffraction images only record partial reflections and downstream processing requires a large number of independent observations per reflection to reliably converge and estimate the full reflection intensity. Parameters such as mosaic domain size and strain or co-existence of multiple crystalline phases further complicate processing. Here, we propose to use high resolution powder diffraction data for extracting domain size and strain distributions and feed those parameters back to serial data processing algorithms for more reliable merging and scaling from fewer diffraction images. Improvements in protein serial data processing could yield better electron density maps that would enable resolving finer structural details, which is crucial especially in time-resolved studies.","3400":"cAMP (Adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate) is a key second messenger in numerous signal trans\u00acduction pathways, regulating various cellular functions. Modulating its cellular concentration has emerged in the focus of modern optogenetic applications putting forward the photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) in the optogenetics toolbox. PACs are light-activated enzymes that combine the capacity of a photoreceptor with that of an adenylyl cyclase; the latter being an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP (adenosine 5' triphosphate) to cAMP. We propose to use high-pressure macromolecular crystallography to study the energy landscape, conformational fluctuations and breathing motions between sub-states of the photoactivated adenylate cyclase (PAC) from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) in order to explore the allosteric transitions between its conformational states.","3401":"Angeac-Charente is an Early Cretaceous dinosaur bonebed located in southwestern France. It has yielded tens of thousands of fossils, representing a snapshot of an ancient wetland ecosystem composed of lizards, birds, amphibians, mammals, fishes, flying reptiles, turtles, crocodiles and dinosaurs. One of the most conspicuous species of dinosaur found at Angeac-Charente is a giant sauropod belonging to Turiasauria. This proposal aims to investigate the internal anatomy of two cranial elements using X-ray synchrotron micro computed tomography: the braincase in order to reconstruct its endocast, the neuroanatomy and the internal ear, and the maxilla to access the morphology and microanatomy of unerupted teeth. All these biological characters have important functional implications, particularly in terms of cognitive abilities and feeding strategy. This data will shed light on the phylogeny and ecology of this dinosaur and help us to understand its role in a wetland ecosystem.","3402":"Reconstructing ancient behaviour is crucial to better grasping the evolutionary origins of mammals; however, fossilised evidence of behavioural complexity is elusive. Here we propose to use SR\u00b5CT to describe and compare the cranial bone histology, brain, nerves and inner ear of a carefully selected sample of mammalian ancestors (therapsids), which display a diversity of head ornamentations (horns, bosses, enlarged canines, etc.) that suggests male to male combat, face biting, and sexual display. Improved knowledge of the adaptations of the nervous system and cranial structure to withstand those fights will provide, for the first time, insight into the diversity of complex social behaviours in therapsids. This will be accompanied by a study of brain size to address whether sociality had an effect on encephalisation. This study has the potential to highlight the existence of complex social behaviours many millions of years before the origin of mammals.","3403":"Paired appendages represent a key innovation of vertebrates: their origins set the stage for new modes of swimming and the eventual transition from water to land. However, the origins of fins and their supporting skeletal girdles remains a mystery and one of the \u201choly grails\u201d of vertebrate evolution. We have uncovered new evidence regarding key theory on the origin of the shoulder girdle: that it derived from an ancestral gill arch. However, this theory so far lacks support from the fossil record. The goal of this project is to investigate the skull and shoulder anatomy of key \u2018transitional\u2019 jawless fishes near the origin of jawed vertebrates, known as osteostracans to test our new hypothesis. We will use synchrotron tomography to illuminate the structure of the braincase, blood supply, and innervation of exceptionally preserved osteostracan fossils. These will provide insights into the relationship between the gill skeleton and the origin of the shoulder and paired fins.","3404":"The early Permian Bromacker locality is central for studying the origin and evolution of tetrapod fossoriality. This site not only holds body fossils of plants, invertebrates and diverse tetrapods, but also a wealth of associated trace fossils, offering unprecedented insights into the ecology and behaviors of animals that died about 290 Ma. Of particular interest are among the oldest tetrapod burrows and associated scratch marks yet discovered. However, the identity of the burrow-makers remains uncertain. Similarly, the life history traits of Bromacker tetrapods have yet to be documented. The current project thus aims at better understanding the physiology of these species by means of virtual bone palaeohistology. In order to pinpoint the architects of these burrow structures, we will also investigate, using Synchrotron X-ray radiation imaging data, the morphological, biomechanical and microanatomical features that could be associated to a degree of fossoriality in these animals.","3405":"The ear is a complex biomechanical system dedicated to sound perception, even though part of the auditory function is in the central nervous system. The coupling between the two middle ear cavities has an effect on the directivity of the eardrum, which acts as a pressure difference sensor. We aim at identifying and quantifying in detail the tympanum structures related to sound perception. This includes the cartilaginous link between the tympanic membrane, the tympanic ring and stapes, the layer of membrane, and the collagen fiber distribution and muscular cells. We will use propagation based nano holotomography as a basis for the construction of a high-resolution three-dimensional dataset. Such 3D models and comparisons between data obtained for 10 samples of species varying in their frequency response should enable the understanding of the biomechanical basis of hearing very high frequency sounds. ","3406":"Structure and function of brain circuits are tightly related by intrinsic and activity-dependent mechanisms, yet subject to stochastic events that may provide variability across individuals. Yet a fundamental question of neuroscience, identifying variability of mammalian neural circuits has so far been elusive. Synchrotron X-ray holotomography (XNH) is unique in reliably resolving non-destructively and densely neuronal processes in tissue, across volumes containing full neuronal circuits. Combining XNH with in vivo imaging, we address this question in a genetically targeted neuronal circuit. We aim to obtain a third biological replicate of the same circuit previously imaged at ID16A, answering the fundamental question of circuit variability and providing unique structure-function datasets of highest interest for wider neuroscience. Moreover, we will perform subsequent electron microscopy (EM) on imaged samples, for the first time combining in vivo imaging, X-ray tomography and EM.","3407":"Cephalopods present one of the most complex invertebrate nervous systems, and exhibit elaborated behaviours, many of which are driven by their advanced visual system. We are generating the first synaptic resolution connectome of the visual circuits of a cephalopod, using the pygmy squid, Idiosepius hallami. The reduced dimensions of this miniaturised species enable the acquisition of the retina and optic lobe with an enhanced focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIBSEM).\r\nTo bridge the detailed visual circuits afforded by our FIBSEM volume with behaviours such as learning or camouflage, the efferent optic lobe nerve tracts have to be followed to other brain regions, and from there onwards to the legs for coordinating locomotion or to the skin for camouflage. An X-ray nanotomography volume of the whole animal will provide that bridge and also guide future targeted FIBSEM volume acquisitions necessary to understand the sensorimotor transformations driving cephalopod behaviour.","3408":"The knowledge of ovary\u2019s sub-structures is highly required to support advances in reproductive technologies based on ovary tissue cryopreservation. The latter is an important clinical approach to preserve fertility of young women and pre-pubertal girls undergoing oncological therapies. This proposal aims at performing X-ray nano-imaging of human ovarian tissues subjected to cryopreservation and vitrification procedures, and of control ovarian tissues (i.e. not frozen specimens). The high-resolution evaluation will allow to access at the nanoscale unprecedented information on human ovary anatomy and it will be able to reveal any tiny structural effect induced by current cryopreservation methods. Moreover, we expect that this investigation will shed light on poor follicles\u2019 survival rate after transplantation. Therefore, a total of 15 shifts has been requested in order to carry out the experiment.","3409":"Manganese (Mn) neurotoxicity causes a disabling movement disorder associated with psychiatric symptoms. We have developed a zebrafish model of Mn neurotoxicity by knockout of the Mn uptake transporter Slc39a14 in order to study the effects of excess Mn on neuronal function. A remaining challenge is to determine the spatial Mn distribution within the zebrafish brain and link functional deficits with regions of Mn accumulation.\r\nThe ID16A nanoimaging beamline will allow generation of a cellular resolution 3D map of Mn within the zebrafish brain. Combination of the beamline\u2019s MicroXRF, phase contrast imaging, and tomographic approaches will provide an unprecedented improvement in our ability to determine the specific neurons and brain regions in which Mn accumulates, and how that affects brain function and behaviour. Together with our ongoing spatial transcriptomic and behavioural studies, this will further our understanding of the disease pathogenesis underlying Mn neurotoxicity.","3410":"Working memory is thought to be mediated by stereotypic neuronal activity patterns in the brain such as neural sequences, in which subsets of neurons are sequentially active in a stereotypical temporal order. Neuronal interactions are fundamentally constrained by the synaptic wiring diagram, but the connectivity between neurons that participate in neuronal sequences is not known, because this requires measuring both the connectivity and activity of hundreds of neurons from the same specimen. Here we propose to use the ID16A nanoimaging beamline to image the connectivity between neurons in a brain sample of a mouse from which we have previously recorded the activity of hundreds of neurons while the mouse was performing a working memory task. By combining functional imaging in behaving mice with X-ray connectomics we will study the structure of neuronal circuits underlying working memory-related sequential neuronal activity.","3411":"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous intracellular parasite, able to infect almost all warm blooded species and most cell types. This promiscuity requires sophisticated mechanisms to sense, subvert and store nutrients from host cells. Iron is an essential element for almost all life on earth, including T. gondii, however the reactivity which makes it so valuable in enzymatic reactions can be harmful to cells. For this reason, iron is tightly regulated and carefully stored within cells, however the mechanisms by which divergent eukaryotes such as Toxoplasma do this are largely unknown. We are interested in iron in the context of T. gondii infection, specifically where iron is stored within the cells and how infection modulates the host cell iron response. Using the facility at the ESRF, we hope to resolve these questions and determine for the first time how and where iron is stored in the parasite and how it alters the iron balance of the host cell","3412":"The aim of this proposal is to assess bone quality of osteosarcoma resected human tissue by using \u03bcXANES at the Ca K-edges to obtain the chemical speciation of mineral bone at a spatial resolution down to the micrometric scale. This will allow to visualise and evaluate bone composition of osteosarcoma tissue and to compare the healthy control bone with OS affected tissue from the same subject. Due to its rarity, osteosarcoma is still lacking a reliable and precise chemical characterization of bone composition and the results of this proposal will help to tackle this gap. Thanks to a better understanding of bone changes in OS tissue this study could be translated into: i) pre-clinical research, ii) therapeutic strategy and iii) eventually clinical practice.","3413":"Owing to the content of the Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), they can target their cargoes to control and mediate the intercellular communications by both paracrine and endocrine mechanism. Yet, their exact interaction mechanism is not yet fully elucidated. Therefore, we address this by a multi-technique approach, using model membranes of different compositions. We isolated EVs from murine Neuro2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells, treated and untreated with the oligosaccharide OligoGM1, known for its neurotrophic and protective functions in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Those 2 types of EVs were characterized by Western Blotting, DLS, NTA, AFM, DSC, FT-IR and NR, and have already shown different chemico-physical characteristics. However, we believe that SAXS and WAXS experiments will help to disclose more precise structural information of their detailed and different interaction modes with target membranes helping to understand how the treatment with OligoGM1 affects the intercellular communication.","3414":"The heart is constantly beating at the body core temperature (37\u00b0C), adjusting its output to the changing needs of everyday life. We recently exploited time-resolved USAXS and SAXS at ID021 to measure the structural dynamics of the molecular myosin motors in different regions of the thick filament during the unitary mechanical response elicited by electrical pacing at 1 Hz of intact cardiac trabeculae at constant length at 27\u00b0C. Now the smaller beam and higher brightness available at ID02 after EBS combined with the new Eiger2-4M detector allow us to characterise the dynamics of the regulatory structural changes in the thick filament in thin cardiac trabeculae isolated from rat hearts for the first time at physiological temperature and pacing frequency, with faster kinetics of force development and relaxation.","3415":"Rapid relaxation following active contraction is essential to the efficient performance of both skeletal and cardiac muscle, but its mechanistic basis is poorly understood. The well-known decrease in intracellular calcium concentration is necessary but not sufficient for rapid relaxation, and there is likely to be an additional mechanical trigger. This proposal will use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to characterise the molecular structural changes in the muscle filaments during the relaxation of skeletal muscles of mammals, and their dependence on imposed mechanical perturbations. The results will help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, underpinning the development of novel therapies for disease in both skeletal muscle and in the heart.","3416":"Aim of this proposal is to study the structure of magnetosomes, which are chains of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles that we are able to extract and purify from Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense bacteria. Magnetosomes are of significant interest as tools for delivery drugs to a targeted area because of their small size, ferromagnetic properties and presence of membrane proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer that covers the surface of the iron oxide core. Structural information regarding core and layer dimensions as well as core crystallinity and number of magnetosome units per chain will be obtained with SAXS and WAXS experiments that we plan to perform on samples obtained by bacteria that have been grown under a wide range of controlled conditions.","3417":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3418":"Modulating the conformational dynamics of RNA riboswitches is a promising route toward understanding gene expression and the development of antibiotic alternatives. A prerequisite for this is detailed structural and kinetic information along the folding\/unfolding pathway of the riboswitch\u2019s aptamer domain. Therefore, we request time for microfluidic-based cSAXS measurement to investigate the aptamer conformation of three different 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1)-I riboswitches folding upon the addition of the ligand preQ1 and divalent ions (namely Mg2+ and Ca2+).\r\nThese SAXS profiles will be visualized using our SAXS-driven molecular dynamics approach. In this way, we will obtain RNA conformation that will be the starting point for subsequent all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and utilized to interpret further biophysical investigation of preQ1-I riboswitches.\r\n","3419":"SAXS has been used to gain deeper insight into protein-protein (PP) distances and interactions by the structure factor S(q). But there is a lack of knowledge about highly concentrated states of 200 g\/L protein and above, in particular, those formed upon freezing of bulk solution for frozen storage, as ice crystallizes out and solutes, protein, and excipients like cryoprotectant or buffer, concentrate. Furthermore, more insights into the relationship between S(q) and viscosity are to be obtained. \r\nThe focus of the study is to investigate\r\n1. the impact of freeze concentration on PP distance and interactions,\r\n2. the effect of formulation on PPI and PP distance in the freeze-concentrate,\r\n3. the relationship between viscosity and S(q) and comparison to theoretical SAXS data obtained by molecular dynamics simulations.\r\nPharmaceutically relevant monoclonal antibodies will be used.","3420":"We aim to observe structural perturbations using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) for two different ion channels (KcsA and LGC-39) and in cytochrome P450. We will take advantage of 3D printing technologies to overcome previous limitations in difference X-ray scattering studies when mixing samples. A recent proof-of-principle test at ID02 of the ESRF successfully observed structural changes in KcsA by using UV light to release caged protons, thereby jumping the sample from pH 7 (neutral) to 4 (acidic). We will extend this study using a mixing cell to induce a similar pH jump. Should both approaches yield similar structural changes, the same approach will probe ligand-binding-induced conformational changes in a ligand gated ion channel (LGC-39) isolated from the model-organism C. elegans, and ligand-binding-induced conformational changes in cytochrome P450, a drug metabolizing enzyme. This work increases our understanding of neuronal transmission selectivity and enzyme activity.","3421":"Muscle contraction is regulated by both Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation and mechanosensing-based thick filament activation that switches ON the motors in relation to the load. Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in its central one-third and bridges thin and thick filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments, conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in specific proteins.","3422":"A new fluorophore is currently under development for fluorescence-guided surgery. This contrast agent spontaneously accumulated in some tumor types, but almost failed to accumulated in other ones. To understand the tumor accumulation mechanism, we designed a study which indicated a strong association of the contrast agent with lipoproteins and more particularly with low density lipoprotein (LDL). \r\n\r\nWe are now wondering where\/how the contrast agent and the LDL interact: is the contrast agent at the interphase with the shell or with the core or the LDL? Is it associated with a specific part of the LDL? \r\n","3423":"The emergence of serial crystallography (SX) has changed the feasibility landscape in structural biology, enabling room-temperature (RT) structure determination from micro-crystals and the conduit of time-resolved experiments even on non-reversible biological systems. Among synchrotron beamlines that enabled this shift in paradigm, ID13 stands out for its unmatched brilliance and focusing. A limit was however reached with nanocrystals of the mosquitocidal toxin Cyt1Aa which, before the EBS upgrade, diffracted to 4.5 \u00c5 resolution at 100 K on ID13, compared to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution at RT at LCLS. As the flux at ID13 is now ~50 times higher, chances are high that higher resolution data can be collected from these crystals at 100 K \u2013 and possibly even at RT - using nano-SSX. The goal of our proposal is to verify this hypothesis and benchmark the nano-SSX capabilities of ID13 after the EBS upgrade, thereby assessing whether nano-SSX could lead the future of macromolecular crystallography.","3424":"The mosquito Aedes albopictus is an invasive species that has colonised the south of Europe and it's expanding its range toward the North. It is a vector of multiple human and animal pathogens and its bites cause itching bumps, thanks to the saliva that is injected in the skin during the acquisition of a blood meal. The saliva helps mosquito to find a vessel in the skin and we have previously demonstrated that one protein, named LIPS-2, binds the tip of the labrum, which is one of the component of the mosquito proboscis that are inserted in the skin. This interaction is mediated by a cuticular protein, Cp19, and causes a modification of the cuticle of the labral ridges; concomitantly, this interaction induces the probing movements of the mouth. But how a protein-protein interaction can mediate a behavioural change? We believe that this interaction changes the conformation of the chitin fibrils and that this change can be sensed by nerve dendrites.","3425":"The main aim of this proposal is to study how the osteblasic differentiation stimuli affect the maturation process of mineral depositions released by osteosarcoma SaOS2 cells at 4 and 10 days after osteoblastic induction. To this purpose we will use x-ray scanning nano-diffraction at a spatial resolution down to 50 nm. This will allow to visualise and evaluate the genesis of nano-sized-mineral depositions and collagen fibrils produced by osteosarcoma cells. This study will contribute to unveil the genesis of bone mineralization process in osteosarcoma which is still far from being elucidated. Moreover, this research is a part of a larger project aimed at validating a new anticancer strategy based on the differentiation of osteosarcoma cells towards a less aggressive phenotype. The application of this strategy will be fundamental to improve the chance to translate the new knowledge to osteosarcoma clinical practice and treatment.","3426":"cAMP (adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate) is a key second messenger in numerous signal transduction pathways, regulating various cellular functions, including cell growth and differentiation, gene transcription and protein expression. Modulating its cellular concentration has emerged in the focus of modern optogenetic applications putting forward the photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) in the optogenetics toolbox. PACs are light-activated enzymes that combine the capacity of a photoreceptor with that of an adenylyl cyclase; the latter being an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) to cAMP. We propose to use time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS) in combination with an established photocaging approach to track in real time the structural changes occurring in the photoactivated adenylyl cyclase from a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (OaPAC) during its catalytic reaction, upon light illumination.","3427":"We aim to observe structural perturbations using time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) for the pH sensitive ion channel KcsA. A proof-of-principle study at ID02 of the ESRF used a small amount of beamtime to induce a structural change in KcsA when UV light was used to release caged protons, thereby jumping the sample from pH 7 (neutral) to 4 (acidic). Since those data reveal the end-points of a pH induced transition from one conformation to another, we intend to repeat this study at ID09 where we can incorporate the extra-dimension of time, with the goal of sampling time-delays from a few microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds. As such all the major technical hurdles of this experiment have been validated, and there is every reason to feel confident that a genuinely time-resolved diffraction study should shed new structural insight into the transition from a close to an open conformation of a highly studied potassium channel. ","3429":"The S3 state of the Mn4Ca cluster of nature\u2019s water-splitting engine, Photosystem II, is the last intermediate before O2 formation. Recently, different conformations of the S3 state (MnIV4 with S = 3 or S = 6)1\u20133 have been presented using EPR spectroscopy and proposed to be intermediates of the catalytic cycle. The heterogeneity is dependent on the treatment of Photosystem II and interestingly, is species-dependent i.e., different S3 configurations have been proposed for procaryotes (low spin S3 form) and eucaryotes (high spin S3 form). Based on DFT it was proposed that the two different configurations of S3 would lead to two different mechanisms of O2 formation in the next step (oxo-oxyl mechanism vs MnV nucleophilic attack). The two different S3 conformers present distinct pre-edge spectra. We propose to test experimentally this intriguing hypothesis by measuring the pre-edge of different conformations of the S3 state using two different organisms and different treatments. ","3430":"One of the grand quests in neuroscience is to build complete maps of the brain, charting all of its cells and the connections between them. Such wiring diagrams, called connectomes, promise to shed light on how networks of neurons can give rise to thoughts, memories, and actions, and to help reveal the underlying causes of neurological diseases. However, due to the scale of mammalian brains new technologies are needed to comprehensively map them.\r\nIn our previous LTP (LS2892, 2021-2023), we established X-ray coherent microscopy as a new technique for mapping of large tissue samples. We propose extending our LTP to use the techniques we recently developed to map several brain regions with unprecedented detail, including the neocortex, cerebellum, and hypothalamus. These datasets will reveal fundamental organizational principles of brain networks, and further establish X-ray microscopy as a critical technique for global efforts to completely map mammalian brains.","3431":"How is information processed in the brain? How does the wiring of brain cells relate to their function? How does one brain differ from another?\r\nThese are some of the most fundamental questions of neuroscience - and to answer them we need to study the functional activity of neurons in the brain in combination with their structure: their morphologies and crucially how they are connected with each other. In this LTP we will answer these questions in the mammalian brain, where we will link the physiology of a circuit in vivo with its detailed anatomy revealed by X-ray Holographic Nanotomography (XNH) and subsequent targeted volume electron microscopy (vEM) across landscapes extending beyond the >mm3 volumes required to fully contain the circuits. To this end, we will develop XNH for >mm3 volumes, new sample preparation, staining, and embedding methods for coherent X-ray imaging, and correlative pipelines to link all modalities.\r\n","3432":"Solid assemblies of organic compounds often include some inevitable misfit between constituents, giving rise to geometric frustration. In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, for small enough assemblies there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favourable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In the proposed experiment, we will apply the BCDI method to follow the evolution of lattice distortions in a branched protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also allow us to establish an explicit toolkit for controlled branching of macromolecular crystals.","3433":"Meanwhile, yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is the most important material for dental prosthetics. Doping with Y2O3 aims at stabilizing tetragonal ZrO2 at low temperatures and avoiding monoclinic and rhombohedral modifications. The integrity of the initial phase composition is important for mechanical stability, surface roughness and optical properties. Nevertheless, common machining procedures such as grinding and sandblasting, spur YSZ's tendency to phase transformation. XRD helps to quantify this effect, but the information is neither depth resolved nor going beyond the sample surface. Electron microscopy can provide this information, but sample preparation by FIB and exposure of the observed regions can itself influence the phase composition. Diffraction tomography provides exactly the required conditions and information. Based on the results of these experiments, we will present adjusted parameters for grinding and sandblasting in favor of optimal properties.","3434":"Organometallic gold complexes bearing biphenyl and diphosphine chelating ligands of the general formula [(C^C)Au(P^P)]+ present antiproliferative activities in the submicromolar range. We could demonstrate by various techniques including mass spectrometry and cryo-XRF mapping (ESRF, LS-3136) these complexes to be stable inside lung cancer cells and to accumulate selectively in mitochondria. We apply for beamline time at FAME UHD to perform cryo-X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy measurements on treated cancer cells with our [(C^C)Au(P^P)]+ gold complex in order to confirm its intracellular stability by the mean of the determination of the oxidation state and first coordination sphere of the gold ion. This would represent the first speciation study of gold(III) complexes inside cancer cells","3436":"BM31 offers a unique possibility to investigate the proposed reduced radiation-damage of redox proteins at lower wavelength X-ray diffraction. The overall aim of the project is a proof-of-concept if the use of lower wavelength X-rays can reduced radiation-induced reduction of redox- and metalloproteins, and to see if this can be an alternative to neutron diffraction or XFEL. The second goal will be to obtain the unreduced structures of selected redox proteins. The radiation damage will be monitored with in situ single-crystal spectroscopy which is available at the Swiss-Norwegian Beam Lines.","3437":"The tetrapod skull has repeatedly lost bones throughout its evolutionary history. This is a well-documented, yet poorly studied convergent trend that has occurred independently in several different tetrapod lineages. This project aims to use histological data to find evidence for bone loss via fusion. We will search for evidence of fusions in the temporal and median series of the dermatocranium in several different early tetrapods. This will include stem amniotes, as well as the two groups that have been alternatively proposed as stem-lissamphibians; the temnospondyls and lepospondyls. The specimens also possess varying degrees of completeness of the temporal series, which is the most variable region of the dermatocranium. By including these specimens and sampling both the temporal and neighbouring median series, we will be able to see if there is evidence that suggests temporal series bones were lost by fusing with neighbouring temporal or median bones. ","3438":"This study will identify long-term evolutionary developments in mammal reproductive strategy, reflected in the microstructures of long bones. These strategies have fundamentally influenced the macroevolution of mammals since their emergence in the Mesozoic, but the timing and pattern of their emergence remains one of the major unanswered questions in palaeontology. Our study of histological microstructures in the femora and humeri of early mammals will be compared with representatives of the three major groups of living mammals: placentals, marsupials, and monotremes. Previous studies were restricted in terms of sample size and taxonomy due to the destructive nature of traditional histological preparation techniques. The use of non-destructive SRCT mapping will permit us to examine a broad collection of fossil mammals spanning the Late Triassic (~205 mya) to Late Cretaceous (90 mya), as well as extant monotremes \u2013 the latter omitted from previous studies.","3439":"The origins of terrestrial sensory capabilities in vertebrates are a source of major unanswered questions in evolutionary biology. This gap in understanding can be addressed by investigating the neural anatomy of early members of Amniota, the group of four-legged vertebrates that conquered land. Here we propose to scan the skulls of four extinct early amniote species (comprising 9 specimens) from the Permian of South Africa. With these scans we will be able to reconstruct their brain endocasts, cranial nerves, and inner ear, enabling an evolutionary understanding of the sensory capabilities in these important fossil species.","3440":"Bipedalism represents one of the most striking forms of locomotor convergence in the history of terrestrial tetrapods. However, it remains unclear whether bipedalism occurred because it conveyed an adaptive advantage over quadrupedal locomotion or that it may have simply resulted as a biomechanical consequence of higher acceleration, or if it was the result of multiple factors. The oldest taxa hypothesized to have employed bipedalism date back to the early Permian, including Eudibamus cursoris and Cabarzia trostheidei. Nonetheless, interpretations regarding the bipedal aptitude of these species have primarily leaned on rather subjective evidence, and this hypothesis has never been tested directly using rigorous biomechanical analyses. The current project thus aims at better understanding the morphofunctional abilities of these species, and to test the degree of their proposed bipedalism using innovative biomechanical analyses combined with paleohistological and ichnological data.","3441":"Modern crocodiles are often seen as sluggish, primitive animals with sprawling postures and aquatic habits remaining unchanged over millions of years. However, they are derived from small, active protosuchians with erect postures. Understanding the biology of these extremely rare early crocodilians from the early Jurrasic is therefore critical for assessing early crocodilian history. We propose to scan two new early South African crocodilians that will assist in our understanding of this group and where the modern traits evolved in the phylogeny. The very gracile specimens preserve elements of the skull, body armour, and extremely long limbs. In this study, we propose to use PPC-SR\u03bcCT to image the complete fossil and further at submicron voxel size to image osteohistological cross-sections of the long bones of both fossils. These novel data on the evolution of different growth strategies, locomotion and ecology will help understand the early diversification of crocodilians.","3442":"Mosquitoes are widely recognized as the deadliest animals on the planet, responsible for more human deaths per year than any other creature. This diverse family of insects includes around 3,600 known species, each with unique ecologies, behaviors, and vectorial capacities, as well as preferences for hosts to bite. Interestingly, three genera of mosquitoes have evolved away from blood feeding altogether, exhibiting distinct behaviors and reproductive strategies. By studying these \"exotic\" mosquito species, we can gain\r\ninsights into the evolution of blood feeding in mosquitoes and its consequences. To this end, we generated high quality reference genomes of species in which blood feeding was lost or is strikingly different than the traditional human-biting mosquitoes. We propose to scan males and females of these species to set up a new and powerful approach for studying the evolution of behavior using comparative genomics side by side with comparative morphology. ","3443":"The goal of the experiment is to acquire an entire zebra finch brain (480\u00b110 mm3; n=4, mean\u00b1std) at a voxel size of 720 nm, which is sufficient to identify cell bodies and trace individual large myelinated axons (> 2 \u00b5m diameter). Tracing these axons will allow us to generate a detailed map of how different brain areas communicate with each other, which is of particular interest for stuttering behavior and will be a future invaluable resource for general speech and vocal learning research with the songbird as its key model organism. ","3444":"The role of epiphysis cerebri (EC) in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is a focal point of our research. We recently found that EC with neuropathology has noticeable degenerative changes in its concrements and soft tissues. This research proposes to study 3D morphology of human EC, focusing on degeneration of calcification and soft tissue in Alzheimer disease (AD). Microtomography combined with phase contrast imaging at ID19 beamline ESRF will be used for a comparative analysis in control and AD groups. In addition, visualization of highly calcified tissue in 3D will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the role of EC degeneration in AD.","3445":"Enthesis injuries (tendon-to-bone insertion) constitute one of the major sources of tendon injuries worldwide. The multiscale morphological\/mechanical behaviour of the enthesis is complex and driven by a combination of biological, morphological, and mechanical factors that differentiate from the micro- down to the nanoscale. In the proposed experiments, we aim at quantifying the multiscale mechanical and morphological patterns generated on a clinically relevant animal enthesis, complementing capabilities of two beamlines at EBS-ESRF. The samples will be first imaged in a time-resolved in-situ loading to measure the physiological full-field strain evolution, at different strain rates, using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC). Based on insights obtained within these DVC measurements, we will target highly strained regions and extract smaller samples of post-tested enthesis for a morphological quantification at the nanoscale, comparing it to pristine tissue from the same location. ","3446":"Bone grafting is a common healthcare procedure, carried out using natural bone (autograft) or animal derived (xenograft) or synthetic materials. Autografts are preferred but are often not possible meaning that synthetic and xenograft options must be considered. Development targets for synthetic and xenograft materials focus on increasing the speed the graft becomes incorporated with less attention to its long-term stability. Bone\u2019s stability and ability to repair itself is influenced by many variables, but a fluid filled network connecting osteocyte cells called the lacunar-canalicular network (LCN) has been shown to be critical. Here we aim to use the sub-micron tomographic imaging at ID16A to characterize the LCN network in bone regenerated by autologous vs xenografts vs synthetic approaches, correlating with histology and electron microscopy studies to test the hypothesis - LCN architecture varies between grafted bone depending on graft type and this impacts response to insult. ","3447":"Understanding how the mammalian brain develops is the sine qua non condition for deciphering neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), a condition characterized by an abnormal brain development in utero and leading to intellectual and\/or motor disabilities in juveniles. The main structure affected in ND is the cerebral cortex. It is composed of six layers of neurons that are sequentially generated from progenitor cells (PC) during embryonic life. This patterning if altered results in malformations of cortical development (MCD) associated with ND clinical manifestations. Despite progress in MCD diagnosis, the cellular mechanisms regulating the sequential acquisition of PC identity and the orderly buildup of cortex remain poorly understood. Here, based on MCD mouse model, we will combine a dynamic analysis of calcium activity with X-ray holographic nanotomography on cortex slices. This multimodal approach will allow a coordinated study of PC structure and physiology in health and disease.","3448":"The pathways of the brain control the speed of saltatory conduction by means of the micrometer-sized axons. The larger axons the faster the signal conduction along the axon. Holotomography imaging at ID16A showed that axons in the monkey brain visualized in 3D are not cylinder-like as assumed today but form a distribution of diameters along the axon. Human 3D axon morphology has not been explored. Selected pathways with different functions will give new insights into how 3D axon morphology adapts to the need for speed. It will provide validation data for in vivo 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) axon models to explain why a larger population of large axons is detected by MRI but not supported by 2D histology. Further, we will shed light on a novel hypothesis that neurodegenerative diseases may attack different axon diameter populations by quantifying the 3D morphology of known attacked pathways in a diseased brain to be compared with a healthy brain.","3450":"Understanding antimicrobial resistance in bacteria is mandatory to develop new antibiotic therapies. We could show that the anti-infective nitroxoline (Nx) is active against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Nx acts as an ionophore by transporting metals into the bacterial cell, but the mode of action remain largely unknown. Our previous results indicate increase of Mn, Zn and Fe upon Nx treatment as well as Cu accumulation in the periplasm, suggesting perturbation of metal homeostasis by Nx. Furthermore, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging indicates storage of Fe in clusters in untreated E. coli cells. Storage of metals in highly organized intracellular compartments is known to provide resistance against metal stress [1]. We hypothesize that Nx disrupts organization of metal clusters and apply for 2D and 3D XRF nano-imaging to decipher mode of action and resistance mechanism by analyzing Nx-susceptible and resistance generated E. coli cells.","3451":"Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease affecting about 10% of women of reproductive age, which is still poorly understood. A role of iron has been proposed. In endometriosis, iron accumulation can occur within endometrial lesions and peritoneal macrophages. This project aimed at investigating by XRF microscopy the appearance of environmental chemical elements, that possibly colocalize with the iron in the invading endometrium. Analyses will be correlated to clinical information. The study will expand actual knowledge and findings, possibly suggest therapeutic interventions.  ","3452":"Trace elements are essential for normal development and function in biology. Metal misbalance  is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and other diseases. Understanding metal homeostasis depends on our ability to determine metal levels and identify their precise location.  Using X-ray nanoprobes, investigators can produce elemental maps at nanometer resolution but it remains difficult to contextualize their localization.\r\nWe synthesized XFM compatible Co and Ni nanoparticle probes to label organelles and proteins. Their distribution is used as a proxy for organelles and proteins and will be overlaid with the element of interest. Thus far, we have synthesized functionalized Ni nanoparticles to detect mitochondria and CoO nanoparticles clicked to a PEG maleimide linker that can be conjugated to a partially reduced cysteine of a primary or secondary antibody.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to optimize our initial prototypes for these probes. ","3453":"Many gold(III) compounds have been reported to display cytotoxic properties and, as such, could provide safer alternatives to clinically approved platinum-based drugs used in cancer chemotherapy. So as to establish a clear rationale regarding the relationship between chemical structure and reactivity and biological properties, we intend to study the uptake and possible biotransformation of structurally related gold compounds in cancer cell models on the basis of chemical imaging by X-ray fluorescence microscopy to determine the spatial distribution of gold and endogenous elements in single cells at the nanometric scale. Correlative chemical and organelle fluorescence imaging will provide invaluable information on the possible tropism of the compounds to particular cellular compartments as well as their metabolism, giving clues to their mechanism of action.","3454":"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) crucially worse the prognosis of cancer patients, and no treatments are so far available. The treatment of several tumors becomes problematic or prohibitive in patients with severe CIPN, crucially worsening the prognosis. In murine models of CIPN, the Caudal and the Sciatic nerves (CN, SN) has been identified as two fundamental characters of the etiology.  Here, we postulated that early angiogenetic mechanisms start in the peripheral nervous compartments (the dorsal root ganglion, DRG, the sciatic and caudal nerves, SN, CN) mainly affected by the chemotherapy neurotoxicity. However, subcellular structures of DRG, SN and CN are inaccessible by micrometer resolution imaging techniques and, thus, require a more detailed\r\nsetups.  A unprecedented investigation with nanotomography of these tissues is proposed.","3455":"The cemento-dentine junction (CDJ) is an astoundingly fatigue-resistant interface between two tissues: tooth root dentine and cementum. It sustains millions of chewing cycles without failure, yet the role of residual strain between collagen protein and nanocrystals is not known. We propose to correlate nanostructure and residual strains around the CDJ by nanobeam XRD mapping, followed by annealing and re-mapping. Annealing will release strains induced by the protein shown to arise during sample drying. By nano XRD+XRF mapping matched with phase contrast enhanced nano-CT (holoCT) imaging, we will identify the relations between deformation fields and key structural elements: fiber bundles, interface, tubules and cementocyte canaliculi. Such data from several samples measured on ID16B will help us reveal nano- and microstructural strategies for the impressive fatigue resistance of this biological interface region. ","3456":"In the framework of a larger project which aims to advance the use of nanotechnology in foliar fertilization in plants, we propose to provide the first direct evidence how nanoparticles (NPs) cross the leaf-surface and and how they translocate in the phloem. Our previous pilot observations of NPs in the Phloem using X-ray microtomography provides hints how to design a nano-scale imaging study to capture the pathways of NPs and verify if the theoretical descriptions of the NP uptake and translocation process correspond to reality. We will use barley and soy bean plants, both live and freshly harvested parts and complement the full-field tomographic and radiographic imaging with XRF elemental maps of Mn. ","3457":"Our recent research revealed noticeable degenerative change in calcified concrements and soft tissue of human pineal gland (PG) with neuropathology.\r\n However, the genesis and dynamics of PG concrements\u2019 degeneration remains to be answered. In this framework, the investigation of the PG tissue using\r\n advanced synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) mapping and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy may add essential information on\r\n the composition of the PG concremens. The new results will contribute to the scientific knowledge base on the dynamic nature of PG calcium deposits in normal\r\n aged (healthy) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)-affected PG tissues","3458":"Cu is an essential trace element for Human. As free Cu is highly detrimental, the cell develops homeostasis mechanisms to control Cu load. However, Cu homeostasis can be affected in pathologies such as in cancer where Cu increase has been observed. This prompts the need to understand the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, and to further develop anti-Cu therapeutic strategies. Recently, we developed innovative compounds that transport Cu(I) ions and we proved that they can kill cancer cells. To deepen our understanding of both Cu homeostasis in cancer cells and the mechanism of action of our compounds, we aim to study Cu subcellular distribution. To reach these objectives, we plan to perform X-ray fluorescence microscopy on healthy vs cancer cells in cryogenic conditions as well as on cancer cells exposed to a Cu-transporting compound with anticancer activity. These data will reveal the differences in Cu distribution in cancer cells and the pool(s) of Cu affected by our compounds. ","3459":"Magnetoreception, the ability to perceive geomagnetic fields, is known from various animals, including planarians. The mechanism of magnetoreception, however, is still unknown and several hypothesis are discussed. Present data supports the hypothesis that magnetic particles, like single domain crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4), are involved in magnetoreception in planarians. We suggest to screen sections of Planarians for iron deposits in specific regions of interest (ROIs) using SR-XRF. In these regions magnetic signature has been measured using MRI-QSM. Elemental mapping will allow us to test if the magnetic signature (QSM) correlates with the presence of iron, which would be indicative of magnetite-based magnetoreception. This data will provide the basis for ultrastructural investigations, immunohistological characterization and magnetic measurements of the particles to test whether they are suitable candidates for the long sought after magnetoreceptors.","3460":"It is unclear why and how iron accumulates in certain brain regions implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, as well as how iron can move from one brain region to another. We suggest that the axonal lysosomal pathway could transport iron in the brain. The main objective of this project is to detect the presence of iron in the lysosomes along the axons of primary rat hippocampal neurons. We will also investigate the effect of iron overload on iron re-distribution in axons and neurons. These objectives can only be demonstrated using a correlative approach combining high spatial resolution and high sensitivity SXRF (Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence) iron imaging with super-resolution microscopy of lysosomes in axons. This research will serve as a fundamental basis for future studies to develop new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders targeting lysosomal iron.","3461":"Soil organic matter (SOM) in organic surface layers and mineral topsoil horizons of forest soils is an important constituent of the global C cycle. It is susceptible to losses and conversion into atmospheric CO2 by current global warming; yet, calcium (Ca) stabilizes SOM by complexation and\/or formation of SOM-mineral associations and aggregates. The mechanisms involved in this process as well as the microspatial structure of the formed SOM-Ca-mineral associations and aggregates are unknown. We aim to reduce this knowledge deficit by conducting \u00b5-XRF and Ca \u00b5-XANES analyses on topsoil samples of dominating forest soil types on silicate and on calcareous bedrock at ID 21 of ESRF. Combined with existing information and results from NanoSIMS and 13C NMR studies conducted on the same samples, the results of our experiment will provide clues for sustainable SOM management under climate warming.\r\n","3462":"ssues related to protein misfolding and aggregation are central in diverse pathologies, from human diseases to cell stress adaptation failure by bacteria, and are a topic of interest for both fundamental and applied research. Proteins central in protein misfolding issue corrections are the molecular chaperones, essential for cell survival, which may also indirectly effect other processes. One such protein is the Hsp70-escort protein (hHep1), which has chaperone functions but is also essential for mitochondrial protein import. Here, we propose Time-Resolved Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (TR-SAXS) to address the role hHep1 has in this import process by using a stopped-flow rapid mixing setup, and to vary parameters such as membrane composition and temperature to simulate the mitochondrial membrane in different fluidity levels.","3463":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3464":"We aim to establish a new class of minimal living membrane model systems to elucidate the role of lipidome complexity in membrane property and function. Thus building on previous methods developed for performing SANS\/SAXS on live E. coli we propose to conduct proof-of-principle USAXS\/SAXS experiments for probing the nanoscale structure and organization of cell membranes from mycoplasma.  We will take advantage of the feature that mycoplasma require exogenous lipids to build and maintain their plasma membrane to experimentally tune their lipidome composition through defined lipid diets provided in the media. The membrane structure will be revealed by joint analysis of USAXS\/SAXS data of full cells, empty ghosts, and vesicles prepared from lipid extract, and include also SANS data taken on the same systems. In particular, we will interrogate the systems for the effects of cholesterol and bacterial sterol analog diploterol on membrane structure","3465":"Radiation damage is a major limitation in protein crystallography, especially at room temperature (RT), which can lead to incorrect biological interpretation.. Cryo-cooled samples (~100K) have now been used for decades to slow down its progression (~100 fold compared to RT) but such cryo-protection reduces the functionally-relevant conformational heterogeneity of the crystalline sample. \r\nRT data collection recently rejuvenated, through the advent of serial crystallography, in which the X-ray dose deposited on the sample is spread over a large number of microcrystals (typically tens of thousands). In a seminal experiment on ID13, we were able to characterize the progression of radiation damage at RT. However, with the recent EBS upgrade, a 10-fold increase in photon flux density has been obtained on ID13; we therefore propose to reproduce the experiment in these new conditions, to fundamentally understand the mechanism of radiation damage progress at such extreme photon regimes,.","3466":"The enthesis is the insertion site of tendon into bone and it plays a major role in biomechanics of load transfer in our bodies. It has a complicated, hierarchical structure and a graduation of the collagen, mineral properties and orientations. The organization and function of these gradients are still not fully understood. This is due to the complex, 3D organization of the mineralized tissue which is  difficult to study in 3D. To this end, we are currently developing Texture tomography to study the crystallographic texture in 3D. With this technique, we will understand the crystalline texture of the mineral in mouse achilles tendon enthesis (ATE) and compare it to the organization of the collagen fibrils on the nanoscale measured by SAXS tensor tomography. By studying the ATE in three states (healthy, unloaded, reloaded) the impact of loading on the nanostructural organization can be probed to eventually use the biomechanical knowledge for an improved treatment of enthesis injuries.","3467":"The proposed work will apply x-ray scanning micro-diffraction (\u00b5XRD) and x-ray micro fluorescence imaging (\u00b5XRF) to histological sections of human brain tissue to map the distribution of fibrillar aggregates of these proteins and the correlated abnormal deposition of specific elements in or around plaques and tangles. We have performed \u00b5XRD and \u00b5XRF on a section of hippocampus of a subject diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These data have provided significant information on the distribution of fibrillar polymorphs among different plaques and tangles. Due to limited beamtime and initial issues with tissue flatness, we have not yet been able to measure tissue sections from all relevant brain regions for subjects with a full range of disease stages. Thus, to complete our characterization of the pathological pathway of Tau pathology, we propose to measure six brain regions from three patients at different stages of disease by \u00b5XRD at ID13 and \u00b5XRF at ID21. ","3468":"Studying the ultrastructure of spider silk (SPSI) to understand underlying structure function relationships is of great importance for the use of SPSI for medical applications, such as nerve guidance conduits (NGCs). NGCs will undergo strain in vivo when the body parts are moved. Therefore, we wish to explore strain-dependent structural changesthat could influence cell adhesion. By performing in-situ tensile tests on fibers exposed to different relative humidity in combination with high fast nanoXRD mapping, we will obtain detailed information on local deformations in the core and the shell layers. Additionally, fibers immersed in water prior to tensile testing will be examined. We will use egg sac SPSI, which has proven successful in cell culture and is very abundant in principle but rarely studied and poorly understood.","3469":"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many critical cellular processes. We will use laser-induced release from a caged, inactive form of ATP followed by short X-ray pulses at the dedicated time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) beamline ID09 at ESRF-EBS to study protein conformational change in real time. We aim to track how domain movements and kinetics in a bacterial calcium-transporting P-type ATPase (LMCA1) are regulated by lipid chemistry and pH levels. Lipids modulate membrane protein function, but the connection between lipid chemistry and reaction cycle kinetics and dynamics is not well understood. Survival of pathogenic bacteria under basic conditions depends critically on Ca2+ transport. Therefore, structural and kinetic mapping of pH-dependent LMCA1 dynamics can potentially provide clues to better understand the structural basis of infection processes. Overall, the results will provide better understanding of lipid- and pH-induced regulation of calcium transport.","3470":"The protein carH associates with the B12 vitamin, (AdoCbl), to form a light-sensitive gene repressor in bacteria. CarH is composed of a chromophore binding domain (CBD) and a DNA binding domain (DBD). In dark state, the protein forms a stable tetramer. Upon light exposure, the H132 residue of carH binds to the cobalt atom and the tetramer eventually dissociates. Little is known about the structural response of carH after light absorption and we aim at filling this gap. To this end, we already used time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS) at ID09 on the CBD of CarH from T. Thermophilus (TtCBD) (LS-2958). The TtCBD variant do not show teramer dissociation.\r\nHence, time-resolved WAXS data on the full-length TtcarH could clarify the role of the DBD and the tetramer dissociation in the protein functional dynamics. Moreover, structural model for the intermediates of the full-length carH are still missing as the protein crystal usually do not survive the teramer dissociation.","3471":"The knowledge of the toxic and carcinogenic mechanisms of asbestos in living organisms is still incomplete, also due to the poor understanding of the asbestos modifications during its prolonged stay in the biological tissue. To gain new knowledge on the structural modifications of asbestos, and on the chemical composition of the Fe-coating it develops in the tissues (asbestos body), we propose to perform nano-X-ray powder diffraction (nano-XRPD) measurements on asbestos fibers (AF) and asbestos bodies (AB) embedded in lung tissue samples from human subjects who were occupationally exposed to asbestos for years. The proposed experiment is a continuation of experiment LS3009, whose results have been recently published. The aim of this new experiment is to extend the number of samples to generalize the previously obtained results.","3472":"Biological structures are made of smaller building blocks whose specific arrangement defines their properties. Understanding the nano, micro and macrostructure is critical to understanding the tissue, however, imaging methods classically rely on isolating the tissue from its native environment to study its morphology. A different approach is using dark-field imaging and a multi-contrast strategy to study the contribution of the different components to the signal. We propose to use a high-energy small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography on a mouse limb. In this experiment, the direction of alignment and degree of orientation of the collagen fibrils and mineral platelets in the bone, collagen in tendons and ligaments, and keratin in nails and fur can be extracted in the 3D volume from their scattering\/diffraction signal. We believe the experiment will pave the way for understanding tissue organization in a more complete and multi length scale manner.","3473":"Hemopexin (Hpx) is a plasma glycoprotein with very high affinity for heme. It can mitigate heme-mediated oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction and has promising therapeutic applications for hemolytic disorders. The uptake of heme-Hpx is accompanied by an increase in intracellular Cu levels, thus hinting at a dynamic interaction between Cu and Hpx. In vitro studies have indicated that Cu(II) can disrupt heme-Hpx complex formation. Consequently, it has been proposed that Cu(II) binds to Hpx under the acidic endosomal conditions, preventing heme re-binding. This project seeks to elucidate the interplay between Cu and heme binding to Hpx. To this end, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy will be used for the first time to characterize heme- and Cu-binding sites in Hpx in different pH conditions to understand (i) how Cu(II) is bound at both pH, (ii) whether it can be released upon reduction by physiological agents and (iii) what is the mutual impact of Cu- and heme-binding.","3474":"Magnetic hyperthermia is a therapy that aims to kill cancer cells by delivering heat to them. The heating agents employed for this treatment are magnetic nanoparticles, which are internalised by the cells, and heat up when an alternating magnetic field is applied. One of the magnetic nanoparticles currently being studied for biomedical applications are magnetosomes. These are magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles synthesised by magnetotactic bacteria, which exhibit excellent heating efficiency. However very little is know about the fate of magnetosomes once they are inside cells, which is of high relevance if they are to be approved for clinical use. In this experiment we aim to study how the application of magnetic hyperthermia affects the intracellular degradation process of magnetosomes in a 3D tumour model. ","3475":"The crystallographic structure of HtrA2, a mitochondrial serine protease involved in apoptosis, together with molecular simulation studies and viscosities analysis have revealed that the flexibility of two regulatory loops lining the active site is related to functional efficiency and to the high thermostability of the enzyme. The crystallographic structures of different mutants, either in a closed or open conformation, support the hypothesis that the flexibility of the loops surrounding the active site is necessary for catalytic efficiency. High hydrostatic pressure crystallography is an ideal technique to trap high energy transient conformers involved in enzymatic activity and\/or interaction with partners. The analysis of the crystallographic structures of HtrA2 WT and various more rigid mutants under high hydrostatic pressure will allow us to identify precisely the determinants of HtrA2 plasticity related to its functional efficiency and high thermostability.","3476":"cAMP (Adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate) is a key second messenger in numerous signal trans\u00acduction pathways, regulating various cellular functions. Modulating its cellular concentration has emerged in the focus of modern optogenetic applications putting forward the photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PACs) in the optogenetics toolbox. PACs are light-activated enzymes that combine the capacity of a photoreceptor with that of an adenylyl cyclase; the latter being an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP (adenosine 5' triphosphate) to cAMP. We propose to use high-pressure macromolecular crystallography to study the energy landscape, conformational fluctuations and breathing motions between sub-states of the photoactivated adenylate cyclase (PAC) from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria acuminata (OaPAC) in order to explore the allosteric transitions between its conformational states.","3477":"The project aims at studying the potential therapeutic effects of Dasatinib, Quercetin and RO0711401 in an experimental model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) by using a high-sensitivity microscopic approach based on X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT (X-PCI-CT) for multiscale, post-mortem 3D virtual-histology. Neuroprotection is demanded in neurodegenerative disorders such as SCA1, but to date no treatment is currently available. SCA1 is a dominantly inherited genetic disease due to an increase in the number of CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene leading to an expanded polyQ tract in the ataxin-1 protein, and degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC). The expanded ataxin-1 protein forms toxic aggregates, likely the major cause of neuronal cell death. Senescence and reduction of mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in neurodegeneration. Targeting senescent cells or mGlu1 receptors could be potential disease modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.","3478":"The relationships among arthropods (e.g. scorpions, millipedes, shrimps, insects) have long been debated, but refinements in molecular phylogenetics and the inclusion of fossil data facilitated by X-ray computed tomography (XCT) have led to an emerging consensus. Nevertheless, there are still big knots in the arthropod tree of life, namely (i) the position of pycnogonids (\u2018sea spiders\u2019) and relationships among Chelicerata (e.g. horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, mites), and (ii) the origin of insects and relationships among Pancrustacea (e.g. branchiopods, malacostracans, remipedes). Here we propose to apply hierarchical phase-contrast XCT to Devonian (400-myr-old) fossils from Germany, whose level of preservation including soft-tissues is unique for that critical period of arthropod evolution. Anatomical features revealed by XCT (part. the recognition of ancestral morphologies and transitional forms) will provide new phylogenetic insights into the arthropod tree of life.","3479":"Worldwide, palaeontological localities yielding infracentimetric shells of Ediacaran \u2013 Early Fortunian age are relatively abundant, providing generally tubular shells such as Cloudina. By contrast, the deposits of the Ediacaran-Fortunian transition in Brittany, NW France, provide for the first-time giant organisms (up to 50 cm), with an exoskeleton made of scales of various sizes. Moreover, the bilaterian symmetry of each specimen is conspicuous, and an anterior\/posterior axis can be deduced of two possible eye capsules located at the putative anterior end.  Despite compaction, the specimens are preserved in three dimensions. Thus preliminary investigations have demonstrated that the scales are arranged like tiles on a roof. Microcomputed tomography (PPC-SR\u00b5CT) could be an opportunity to describe and understand the detailed anatomy and the phylogeny of unexpected giant squeletized metazoans, anterior to the Cambrian Radiation, and their place in the early evolution of metazoans. ","3480":"Our objective is a study of the human pineal gland (PG), with a focus on identifying signs of degenerative changes of brain tissue in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease) and mental disorders (schizophrenia). X-ray nano-holotomography techniques can provide detailed information about the structural changes occurring in the PG of human affected by the pathologies. This knowledge can contribute to the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative and mental diseases and improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved.","3481":"The structure of a neural circuit tightly constrains its function. Obtaining synaptic level connectomes is the first step towards understanding their physical implementation. Like any other biological entity, nervous circuits evolved by natural selection, i.e a process of random modification of preexisting structures that become predominant if they confer a reproductive advantage to the individual. Since the modifications have to be compatible with the viability of the organism, \u201cinnovations\u201d are constrained and the end product (e.g. brains like ours) result from the accumulation of gradual changes and module repurposing. The comparison of homologous circuits from animals along the tree of life is therefore key to interpret and understand the principles of nervous system organization.To help in this quest, our research aims to generate the fist connectome of Amphioxus lanceolatus, the best studied model organism of the invertebrate to vertebrate transition.","3482":"We will study Ca\/Sr heterogeneities in coccoliths to understand their role in the formation of complex biogenic crystals. We aim to acquire high-resolution 3D X-ray fluorescence (3D-XRF) data from two types of coccoliths (holococcoliths and heterococcoliths) that represent two morphologies: expected calcite habit and asymmetrically grown crystals. We will use the acquired data to correlate Ca\/Sr distribution with our previously obtained 3D nanoscale strain maps. We expect that the results of this proposal will allow us to elucidate the role of elemental heterogeneities in the biological control of strain and crystal morphogenesis.","3483":"In the framework of novel clinical approaches to preserve fertility of young women undergoing oncological therapies, our research focuses on the study of human ovarian tissues at the nanoscale. This proposal is the continuation of the beamtime LS-3190, successfully performed at ID16A beamline last semester. Relying on the valuable 3D information provided by X-ray nano-holotomography, this new project aims to study with sub-cellular detail human ovarian tissues subjected to transplantation in mice models following cryo-conservation procedures. ","3484":"Environmental exposure to mercury (Hg) is an underestimated threat. Hg is classified as one of the 3 chemicals of greatest concern for public health, but mercury pollution is constantly increasing. Hg is neurotoxic, particularly to the foetal nervous system. Our aim is to provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms of Hg neurotoxicity. In our latest experiment at ID16A, we imaged the distribution of Hg and arsenic in neurons exposed to low concentrations of these elements. Unlike arsenic, Hg was not detected in synapses but in spherical micro-structures along dendrites, suggesting a different and unknown mechanism of neurotoxicity. Since then, using immunofluorescence experiments we have revealed dendritic beads in neurons exposed to Hg, a marker of neurotoxicity. We now want to determine whether Hg co-locates with dendritic beads. The expected results will contribute to alert about this environmental threat and to suggest prevention strategies.","3485":"Iron is the most abundant trace metal in the human brain that is crucial for cellular survival and on which rely oxygen transport and mitochondrial respiration. Iron dyshomeostasis with pathological accumulation and induction of pathological protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson and Alzheimer disease. This proposal aims to evaluate iron accumulation in SCA37 nuclear RNA aggregates that would allow to demonstrate iron dyshomeostasis also in this type of neurodegenerative disease.","3486":"Here we want to image the organ of Corti (OoC), the cochlear nerve fibres and the spiral ganglion neurons in small animal models by high resolution X-ray holo-tomography with voxel sizes down to 50nm. Beyond the fundamental neuroscience of the sensory organ associated with the high resolution 3d investigation, the biomedical research associated with this proposal targets three different lines of biomedical research: (i) Age-related structural changes in the OoC, in particular loss of auditorial nerve cells and degeneration, (ii) 3d Virtual histology validating the development of optogenetic hearing restoration, (iii) hearing disorders associated with deficiencies of the protein otoferlin.","3487":"We will study how the fruit fly (Drosophila) photoreceptor synapses adapt to light stimulation. In the classic view, neurones are immobile, and their information transfer quantal, with neurotransmitters released from similarly-sized vesicles. Our new results are now changing this view by showing that synaptic communication is morphodynamic: when adapting to light changes, their structures move and are reshaped dynamically. Using Drosophila as our model, we aim to understand how X-ray stimulation, which activates photoreceptors like visible light, adapts synaptic transmission. Employing high-speed X-ray imaging and electroretinograms, ERGs, we will analyse photoreceptor terminal activity with Drosophila's consistent eye layout aiding synapse identification. Extending our prior work on photoreceptors, we will capture real-time axon terminal movements, synaptic vesicle changes, and ERGs under X-ray and visible light. Our objective is to discern how synaptic morphodynamics enhance vision.","3488":"Enthesis failure (tendon-to-bone insertion) constitutes one of the major sources of tendon injuries worldwide. The main cause resides in its complex structure, developing as a gradient of mineralization and morphological organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) passing from the tendon to the bone tissue. Electrospinning showed the most promising results in driving, especially stem cells, towards regeneration of such complex tissue. We aim to investigate for the first time the full-field morphological\/phenotype changes and the ECM produced by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), cultured in enthesis inspired electrospun collagen-based scaffolds, by using nanotomography. The scans will allow us to elucidate the morphological changes and ECM production of hMSCs in nanofibrous scaffolds with different compositions and nanofibers orientations. This study will furnish fundamental knowledge for the design of a new generation of scaffolds aimed at enthesis regeneration. ","3489":"A major determinant of seed quality is germination speed. Germination speed is dependent on the seed endosperm which allows the root to protrude through still largely unknown mechanisms. Using histochemical staining we observed that several species including Arabidopsis thaliana accumulated iron (Fe) close to the site of germination in the endosperm layer. Previously, we have shown that two metal transporters, VIT1 and MTP8, determine Fe accumulation in the Arabidopsis embryo. We now found that these proteins not only determine Fe accumulation in the embryo but also in the endosperm which impacted the germination speed of these seeds. We aim to use synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping to explore Fe in the endosperm of Arabidopsis wild type and the mutants in depth. This study will link Fe homeostasis to seed germination for the first time and explain the genetic mechanism behind it, potentially opening new avenues to improve seed quality for achieving higher yields in agriculture.","3490":"Foliar fertilisation of phosphorus (P) is an alternative for reducing the use-efficiency and the environmental threats associated with phosphate-based fertilisers. Moreover, silicon (S) hyperaccumulator species were found to have limited Si accumulation in P-deficient wheat seedlings. Therefore, the present proposal aims to explore synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy to evaluate the distribution of P and Si in wheat seedlings cultivated under P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions, as well as to assess the dynamics of foliar P absorption when supplied either as hygroscopic or non-hygroscopic P-salts. The results will help to establish a link between P and Si nutrition on stress tolerance in plants and optimise P- P-based fertilisers.","3491":"Beamtime for this project was allocated as LS3204, but the proposed experiments could not be carried out in June 2023. The heart is constantly beating at the body core temperature (37\u00b0C), adjusting its output to the changing needs of everyday life. We recently exploited time-resolved USAXS and SAXS at ID021 to measure the structural dynamics of the molecular myosin motors in different regions of the thick filament during the unitary mechanical response elicited by electrical pacing at 1 Hz of intact cardiac trabeculae at constant length at 27\u00b0C. Now the smaller beam and higher brightness available at ID02 after EBS combined with the new Eiger2-4M detector allow us to characterise the dynamics of the regulatory structural changes in the thick filament in thin cardiac trabeculae isolated from rat hearts for the first time at physiological temperature and pacing frequency, with faster kinetics of force development and relaxation. ","3492":"We will exploit the unique capability of ID02 to measure \u00b5m- to nm- scale X-ray reflections with millisecond time resolution to determine both the molecular and supra-molecular mechanisms that control the dynamics of relaxation of intact skeletal muscles following single action potential stimulation in near-physiological conditions that mimic the performance of the muscle-tendon complex in vivo. On the molecular scale, we will measure structural changes in both the thick (myosin-containing) and thin (actin-containing) filaments. On the supra-molecular scale, we will characterize the inter-sarcomere dynamics that limit the rate of relaxation in vivo, and relate those changes in sarcomere length to simultaneous conformational changes in the thick and thin filaments. The results will underpin the development of new therapeutics for muscle weakness.","3493":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3494":"Muscle contraction is regulated by both Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation and mechanosensing-based thick filament activation. Evidence is growing for the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in the central one-third of either half filament and bridges thin and thick filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments, conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in specific proteins.","3495":"Heart contractility as one of the most important physiological functions relies on an intricate molecular and cellular architecture of cardiomyocytes (CM, heart muscle cells). Here we propose a single cell SAXS study of targeting the sarcomeric contraction in different stages of the contractile cycle, taking advantage of our previous work on scanning diffraction, sample environments, and analysis [1-5]. To this end, we will combine high resolution in real space (2\u00b5m beam at ID13) with high resolution in reciprocal space (unfocused collimated beam, 30\u00b5m spot size at ID02). Isolated human and murine CMs will be probed at a single cell level, hydrated and chemically fixed, using single shot acquisition. ","3496":"The goal of this experiment is to use X-ray imaging techniques to enhance the understanding of grown brain tissue cultures (\u201corganoids\u201d). To better mimic the 3d nature of tissues, organoids can be grown as spheres. However, standard imaging methods are insufficient to understand their growing process and architecture.\r\nX-ray nano-holotomography (XNH) can reveal the 3d-anatomy of brain organoids, to access the spatial distribution of cells and further characteristics related to tissue-growing. The here-presented XNH-data have been collected at the ID16A-beamline. Being sensitive to the electron density using XNH, we do not only identify cells in general with distinct grayvalues, but have also access to the chromatin packing and through that, potentially, to the sequencing activity. In order to better understand this signal and to access the chromatin conformation in greater detail, we want to do correlative small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on 2d-sections.","3497":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults in the Western world. In this disorder, the patient's immune system attacks the myelin sheath or the axons, causing inflammation and leading to irreversible neurological disability. Unfortunately, there are currently no widely used regenerative therapies in MS. In this context, the introduction of a non-invasive treatment promoting remyelination in MS patients has the potential to reduce long-term disability. In this framework, we plan to explore the efficacy of transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) neurostimulation treatment by comparing treated samples with healthy and diseased ones. Our study intends to provide a deeper understanding of myelin degeneration in MS and the impact of FUS treatment.","3498":"Biomineralized tissues like bone and the bone-tendon interface (enthesis) play a crucial role in the functioning of our body. Bones are subject to constant remodelling throughout our life to maintain their performance. The enthesis adapts their mineralized areas to changes in the mechanical loading. While the mineralization process to adapt to different load conditions differ substantially between bone and enthesis, common features exist. Both tissues exhibit zones at the interface of mineralization differing in composition from the surrounding mineralized tissue. In both cases, an accumulation of Zn is visible. This prompts questions on (1) the role of Zn, (2) its generality in biomineralization and (3) the form of Zn incorporation in the structure. We aim at investigating the local chemistry around the Zn site with XANES at ID21 and then study the structural localization of Zn with anomalous SAXS\/WAXS at ID13 to see if the Zn is incorporated into the bone mineral\/collagen portion.","3499":"Heart failure is a life-threatening clinical syndrome with a poor overall prognosis and is a leading cause of hospitalization of older adults. The heartbeat depends critically on carefully regulated flows of calcium in the heart muscle cells. Heart failure is commonly associated with disturbances in the transport of calcium back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) storage after heart muscle contraction. This transport is carried out by ATP-dependent Ca2+-transporting proteins (SERCA) embedded in the SR membranes. A few SERCA-activating compounds have been developed, but suffer from lack of specificity. A major hurdle that prevents implementing activators in clinical usage, is that drug development currently is blind to the underlying molecular mechanism (including the transport kinetics) of SERCA activation. Therefore, we will use time-resolved X-ray solution scattering to determine which parts of the reaction cycle are affected by the drug and the associated time scales.","3500":"Serial X-ray crystallography (SX) at synchrotrons allows structure determinations at nearly physiological temperatures and with time resolution down to the nanosecond range to observe binding of chemical compounds and the course of chemical reactions at atomic resolution in 3D. A current limitation of SX for high-throughput applications are the long data collection times and the large amounts of sample required for such projects. Within this proposal we aim at developing the new method of beam sweeping SX, where the X-ray is scanned over the semi-stationary sample with the use of rotating X-ray mirrors. The proposed beam-sweeping SX approach will allow MHz data collection with a complete dataset to be collected in seconds, enabling rapid structure determination. This will open new opportunities for drug discovery and pharmaceutical compound screening experiments, where much larger compound libraries can be studied at room temperature with less sample consumption than required today","3501":"The protein carH associates with the B12 vitamin to form a light-sensitive gene repressor in bacteria. The gene repressive state in the dark binds to the DNA as a tetramer. The light triggers the dissociation of the adenosyl group from the cobalamin, the coordination of the cobalt to the H132 of carH and the dissociation of the tetramer. We recently obtained time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS) results regarding the tetramer to monomer transition of a truncated form of carH (TtCBD) but we still lack information about the oligomerization change for the full-length carH and for two other variants, the TtH132A mutant and the HmCBD homologue. To this end, TR-WAXS will be used on ID09. Preliminary results on TtCBD show the presence of two structural intermediates relaxing within 3 ms and 300 ms before the tetramer dissociation occurs. We aim at collecting data on the other carH variants for long time delays ranging from 100 ms to 5 s as recently achieved on ID09 for TtCBD.","3502":"Photosystem II of natural photosynthesis utilises the energy of sunlight to drive the four-electron oxidation of water to dioxygen at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). This harbours a Mn4CaO5 cluster that cycles through five oxidation states Si (i = 0\u20134). The critical S2\u2192S3 transition, the last step before O2 formation, is a multistep transition that combines deprotonation, oxidation, and water binding to the Mn4CaO5 cluster. The sequence of events, the water access site, and the nature of the possible intermediates remain highly controversial, partly because multiple forms exist in the S2 state, and it is unclear which one progresses to the S3. We propose to measure the high spin configurations of the S2 and S3 states, which are relevant to the water binding step, using high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) at the Mn K-edge and correlate them with DFT models.","3503":"The use of Os and Ru complexes is part of a new focus on the use of metals in medicine due to their effectiveness as anti-cancer agents. Although some Ru complexes have already reached clinical trials, e.g., KP1019 (indH2[trans-RuCl4(indH)2]; ind = indazole), developed by one of the co-authors of this proposal (Arion), investigations of analogous Os complexes are still in development but have shown great promise as (pro)-drugs. In this context, we carried out 187Os nuclear resonance scattering in a series of nine Os coordination complexes to obtain detailed information on the local coordination (the so-called quadrupole splitting) and the vibrational properties (summarized in the density of vibrational states of Os). An important issue, which still needs to be addressed, is to obtain information on the Os oxidation state (obtained from the so-called isomer shift).","3504":"Using Nuclear Inelastic Scattering (NIS) we want to explore whether NIS-active protein modes can be used to investigate pH-dependent protonation effects. For that purpose we suggest to perform NIS experiments on the protein Apd1 which has an unusual 2Fe-2S cluster bound to the protein matrix via two cysteines and two histidines. Using quantum chemical density functional theory calculations coupled with molecular mechanics (QM\/MM) the vibrational modes of the whole Apd1 protein will be simulated yielding pH dependent structural models.   ","3505":"High resolution multi-modal X-ray imaging, combining X-ray phase contrast and X-ray fluorescence nano-tomography, is now instrumental to target regions\r\nof interest in large organisms or complex samples (CLXEM - CXEM). Cellular electron tomography has shown the importance of studying biological processes directly within the cellular context compared to in vitro purified complexes. However, for eukaryotic organisms the application of this technique is almost entirely confined to isolated cell lines grown on the EM support grid. To overcome this technical limitation, the development of new correlative and integrated imaging approaches aims at studying cellular ultrastructure and sub-cellular molecular processes directly within native multicellular environments. This proposal aims to develop high-throughput sample preparation workflows with a multi-technique sample support to bring breakthrough results in infection biology and new services to ESRF users\r\n","3506":"We will continue our study of strain distribution in coccolith crystals to understand the role of the strain and elemental heterogeneities on asymmetric growth of symmetry-related planes in biogenic calcite. This continuation experiment will be supported by our previous experiment, where optimal conditions for data acquisition were successfully found (Figure 1, LS 3164) and by chemical information obtained using high resolution XRF study of the coccolith crystals on ID16a. ","3507":"The enthesis is an insertion site of tendon into bone with a highly complex organization. Gradients in collagen and mineral content, organization and structure across the enthesis at multiple hierarchical levels provide it with exceptional mechanical properties. However, the local deformation mechanisms, especially at the nano- and microscale, are still poorly understood. This is partly due to the difficulties of studying the smaller length scales of this region in 3D. To this end, we propose to use Texture tomography (TexTOM), together \u00b5m phase contrast CT to study the mouse Achilles tendon enthesis during in situ mechanical testing to understand both the nano- and microscale deformation and load transfer mechanisms of the enthesis and their relation to the overall response of this interface.","3508":"Cu is an essential trace element for Human. As free Cu is highly detrimental, the cell develops homeostasis mechanisms to control Cu load. However, Cu homeostasis can be affected in pathologies such as in cancer in which Cu use is optimized. This prompts the need to understand the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, and to further develop anti-Cu therapeutic strategies. We developed innovative Cu(I) ionophores and proved that they can kill cancer cells. Recent X-ray fluorescence microscopy experiments enabled us to show that these compounds disrupt intracellular Cu distribution. To deepen our understanding of both Cu homeostasis in cancer cells and the mechanism of action of these ionophores, we need to study Cu speciation in cancer cells in different conditions (exposed to Cu and\/or Cu(I) ionophore) and compare it with healthy cells. Altogether, these data will reveal the evolution of the status of Cu upon cancer development and the impact of Cu(I) ionophore on this status. ","3509":"This proposal seeks to understand the growth and anatomy of four new species of early-branching theropod dinosaurs from South Africa. We propose high-resolution scans of skull and limb bones of this new material, suitable for anatomical reconstruction and digital osteohistology. The resulting data will be used to test the position of these new species on the tree of theropod evolution and understand their growth strategies and physiology. These lines of enquiry will address a major palaeontological question, namely, why theropod dinosaurs became the apex predators of the late Mesozoic, replacing other incumbent carnivorous lineages after the end-Triassic mass extinction. The material examined here represents the first theropod species from the Triassic of southern Africa. The uniqueness of these specimens, the difficulty in obtaining segmentable CT images, and the high resolutions required for digital osteohistology, require use of non-destructive synchrotron microtomography. ","3510":"The Quercy phosphorites are one of the very rare fossil deposit that yielded tetrapods with soft tissues fossilised in their alive body-dimensions (or \"natural  mummies\").Preserved in calcium phosphate, reproducing tissues at their finest resolution, these mummies have proven great interests to document the paleobiology of these lineages, in particular through their analyses in PPC-SR\u03bcCT. Recently, a new set of Quercy mummies was reported: heads of 35 Ma bats with their soft tissues. Representing the first mammalian instance of this preservation, we undertake to finely characterize the morphology of their hard and soft tissues, including to the ultrastructural level.Using PPC-SR\u03bcCT, we will analyse how the rhinarium and auditive areas inform on echolocation strategy of these extinct bats. We will secondarily acquire scans at higher resolution on specific areas of the preserved tissues (ex: skin, tongue muscles) to assess their degrees of ultrastructural preservation (glands, cells).","3511":"The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two drugs, namely Temozolomide (TMZ) and a new molecule (MV1035), on 3D bioprinted human Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) models by using multiscale synchrotron radiation imaging. We intend to use X-ray micro-tomography (X-PCI-\u00b5CT) to investigate the overall structure of 3D bioprinted models and the cell distribution within them and and nano-holotomography (XNH-CT) to examine in detail the local cell aggregation and organization. No methodologies are available in the laboratory today to evaluate the effects of selected drugs in these types of models without affecting the spatial and molecular composition of the Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM). Our hypothesis is that the surrounding ECM can be a key actor in GBM progression and in the drug efficacy. Synchrotron analysis represents the unique way to confirm our hypothesis","3512":"The origin of jaws and teeth more than 420 million years ago is considered a key evolutionary innovation underpinning the diversity of modern vertebrates (animals with backbones). However, we lack a clear understanding of the origins of jaws and jawed vertebrates due to the extreme rarity of well-preserved and articulated fossils of the group\u2019s oldest representatives. In this project, we will use synchrotron x-ray microtomography to reveal the anatomy of a series of unusually complete early jawed vertebrate fossils that preserve key anatomy for resolving this puzzle. We will use these results to generate three-dimensional virtual anatomical reconstructions, helping to fill a major gap in the origin of this important group. These data will allow us to test hypotheses about the origins of jaws and teeth, as well as testing theories about the wider evolution of the oldest jawed vertebrates.","3514":"When did tetrapods acquire a wrist? Was the wrist formation a gradual process or a rapid innovation during the fin-to-limb transition? We don\u2019t know exactly. We know that the wrist forms from the aggregation of short bones but their emergence and evolution are still unclear. Bone microanatomy and microstructure is an excellent source of developmental information to address our questions, but the rarity of fossils and the destructiveness of sectioning techniques have rendered the histological investigation impossible. In order to fill our knowledge gap on the origin of this key joint region, we propose to image the appendages of 380-300-My-old unique stem tetrapods emblematic of the so-called fin-to-limb transition. Using a multiscale approach with propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography, we will be able to collect data on key fossils to draw a complete picture of this great evolutionary event at the origin of the remarkable radiation of tetrapods worldwide. ","3515":"Insect brains are exquisite biological microcomputers that allow, in some species, high-precision navigation over miles, face recognition, numerical reasoning and observational learning of actions. The recent studies in fruit fly Drosophila utilized the EM connectomes and genetic tools to reveal how the neural circuits of the Mushroom Body (MB) operate to perform relatively simple associative learning tasks. Here, we propose to discover a comprehensive set of cell types projecting to the MB of bumblebee and identify bee-specific circuit architectures by analysing their projection patterns using X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH). The resulting \u201cprojectome\u201d of the bee\u2019s memory center will be a foundation to pinpoint the key mechanisms of intelligence. \r\n","3516":"Our current understanding of the vibrissa follicle stems from lightmicroscopy. Inferring 3d structure from 2d serial sections poses serious limitations, however. Preliminary findings from a test scan at the ID16A in contrast provided a much richer picture of vibrissal innervation and ultrastructure. In the so called vibrissa follicle complex the 3d arrangement of mechanosensitive nerve endings determine transduction mechanisms in the context of elaborate accessory structures. Holotomograms provide distinctive advantage in resolving this arrangement to elucidate this poorly understood mechanosensory structure of mammals. Here, we aim to image the nanostructure of a whole vibrissa follicle and the first neuronal projection layers in the brain at the ID16A. Such data would allow for the first time a synopsis of all axons entering the follicle along with accessory mechanosensory machinery.","3517":"The pathways of the brain control the speed of saltatory conduction by means of the micrometer-sized axons. The larger axons the faster the signal conduction along the axon. Holotomography imaging at ID16A showed that axons in the monkey brain visualized in 3D are not cylinder-like as assumed today but form a distribution of diameters along the axon. Human 3D axon morphology has not been explored. Selected pathways with different functions will give new insights into how 3D axon morphology adapts to the need for speed. It will provide validation data for in vivo 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) axon models to explain why a larger population of large axons is detected by MRI but not supported by 2D histology. Further, we will shed light on a novel hypothesis that neurodegenerative diseases may attack different axon diameter populations by quantifying the 3D morphology of known attacked pathways in a diseased brain to be compared with a healthy brain.","3518":"Bone remodelling is regulated by osteocytes and occurs through complementary functions of bone building and bone resorbing cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteocytes are enclosed in lacunae interconnected via an extended 3D network of canaliculi to form the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN), crucial to maintaining mineralised bone homeostasis. Loss of bone strength and bone mineral density occurs with ageing, possibly related to an observed deterioration of network connectivity leading to an altered fluid flow through the OLCN, shown to be a regulator of the bone remodelling process. We propose to investigate OLCN network distortions using synchrotron X-Ray nano-holotomography (SR XNH) in osteons of healthy individuals of different age and in samples from patients carrying a mutation affecting the OLCN. The possibility of resolving single canaliculi will provide insight into the deterioration process of the OLCN, a possible contributor of age-related bone loss.","3519":"Animals adapt their behaviour across the day producing circadian rhythms. The physiological basis behind these rhythms have been extensively characterized in the fruit fly, where a network of ~150 neurons in its brain regulates the behavioural entrainment to the time of the day. To characterize the key peptidergic neurons from this central oscillatory network, we propose to interrogate in a correlated fashion on the same samples: 1) structural changes in the axon terminal arborizations involving the assembly and disassembly of synapses; 2) changes in the activity patterns reaching the synapses to trigger neurotransmitter release and 3) changes in synaptic vesicle distribution and abundance, across the time of the day. We will establish and demonstrate a correlative imaging workflow involving functional imaging of neuronal activity reaching the output synapses, X-ray tomography of sLNv fine morphology utilizing the ID16A beamline, and FIB-SEM interrogation of synaptic vesicles.","3520":"Bacteria store polymers of inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) in granules. Our research aims to unveil the PolyP nano-compartments, in radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr), which are crucial for its stress response, containing metals such as K, Ca, and Mn, as confirmed by X-ray fluorescence imaging (XRF). Cryo-STEM-EDX analyses validated previous XRF results, revealing high P concentration and other metals like K, Na, and Mg. However, signals for Ca, Mn, and Fe were undetectable. Deinococcus indicus, exhibits radiation resistance and tolerance to high arsenic concentrations. Given the chemical similarities between arsenate and phosphate, we hypothesize that arsenate may be store in the nano-compartments, suggesting potential bioremediation applications. Given the growing interest in CryoEM, our proposal is essential for CryoSTEM-EDX validation, ensuring a comprehensive comparison with XRF. Additionally, it explores the potential of nano-compartments for As bioremediation.","3521":"We have developed promising \"all-in-one\" GdF3-based nanohybrids for both imaging and X-ray photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) on Spectral Photon Counting Scanner CT (SPCCT). We obtained promising results on their intracellular quantitative distribution but on a very limited number of cells per condition. Indeed, XRF nanoimaging is a low-throughput technique. We are developing an AI-based guided-XRF system to reach mandatory statistically significant sampling. In the current proposal, we will benefit from these developments by performing intelligent on-line analysis and decision-making, reducing the involvement of an operator, and increasing the throughput. We expect that the results of this proposal will contribute to the fast development of imaging\/therapy in X-ray SPCCT and also allow us to showcase the in-house developments to speed up future nanoimaging experiments. ","3522":"Animals sense painful stimuli through specialized sensory neurons on the skin and generate nocifensive behaviours to protect themselves from severe injury.\r\n Specialized sensory neurons carry nociceptive information to the central nervous systems (CNS) locates in the spinal cord dorsal horn to trigger avoidance\r\n behaviour. Recently, our lab identified a distinct class of sensory neurons (called Smr2+ neurons due to the unique expression of the gene Smr2) whose activation triggers nocifensive behaviour in mouse (unpublished data). We propose combining the X-ray phase contrast nanoscale tomography with electron microscopy to fully reconstruct the local neural circuitry involving Smr2+ sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Identifying the CNS neurons that process nociceptive information from Smr2+ neurons will represent a major step toward understanding how pain is sensed and processed by the nervous system.","3523":"The liver is a major organ that possesses a very complex architecture. It is organized in hexagonal lobules in which hepatocytes are arranged in cords separated by adjacent sinusoids. Besides, within each cord and between apical surfaces of adjacent hepatocytes, bile canaliculi are formed and constitute a network of micrometer-sized channels. Bile is collected in bile duct thanks to connection with bile canaliculi at the periphery of the lobule. This connection, named canal of Hering, is enigmatic but should be the source of liver progenitor cells. The study of the architecture of the canal of Hering remains a challenge since it is expected to be positioned every ~10 \u00b5m along the bile duct. Our aim is to locate and reconstruct it in 3D. To reach this goal, we aim to use X-ray tomography to image large volumes at a resolution of 25 nm allowing to identify the Hering\u2019s canal. Then, FIB-SEM data of the Hering\u2019s canal will be acquired to reconstruct its structure at nm resolution.","3524":"As the population ages and the prevalence of dental decay and gum disease reduces, people are increasingly retaining their teeth into later life. While this is a desirable pattern, an emerging problem is the management of progressive loss of tooth structure through chemical dissolution over an individual\u2019s lifespan. Current preventative technologies fail to target subsurface enamel damage associate with an acid exposure. In this proposal we aim to quantify the penetrability of the semi-porous enamel surface that results following dental erosion. Using monodispersed magnetic nanoparticles and controlled magnetic fields to draw the particles into the affected enamel surface we can the using sub-micron XRF to map the erosion lesion and interpret both the depth and size of the porous network structure. The findings will help inform the development of the required material properties for new remineralizing technologies to repair damaged teeth. ","3525":"Previous findings established the importance of tuned redox level in the zebrafish embryo development, a process that is highly dependent on metal-bearing metalloproteins, that can modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In this project, we want to tackle the topic of ROS level impact on the biodistribution, bioavailability and oxidation state of four endogenous metals, namely manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). To do so, we would like to perform micro-Xray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy on sagittal sections of 24 hours old zebrafish embryos with varying ROS levels (normal, high and low). This work would be a pioneer work on the regulation of metal homeostasis by ROS levels, and would thus offer a new light on the importance of endogenous metals in the earlier stages of embryo development.","3526":"In the lungs, asbestos fibers develop a Fe-coating that might enhance the toxicological outcome of asbestos. Revealing the composition of the Fe-coating would help understanding its interaction with the biological tissues and its possible role of the asbestos bodies in the pathogenesis. In previous experiments, we unraveled the composition of several asbestos bodies (asbestos + Fe-coating) from the lung tissue of former workers of an asbestos plant by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. \r\nWe now propose to extend the set of samples to lung tissues from subjects with different occupational exposure and from rats exposed to different classes of asbestos (chrysotile, erionite, and crocidolite). This will allow determining if the composition of the asbestos bodies grown on different asbestos classes and in different host organisms is similar. The results will help generalizing the formation mechanisms proposed in our previous works.","3527":"The proposed work will apply x-ray scanning micro-diffraction (\u03bcXRD) and x-ray micro fluorescence imaging (\u03bcXRF) to histological sections of human brain tissue to map the distribution of fibrillar aggregates of these proteins and the correlated abnormal deposition of specific elements in or around plaques and tangles. We have performed \u03bcXRD and \u03bcXRF on a section of Dentate Gyrus of a subject diagnosed with Pick\u2019s disease. These data have provided significant information on the distribution of fibrillar polymorphs among different plaques and tangles. Our results show that \u03bcXRD could identify the fibrillar and oligomeric tau deposition. By correlating \u03bcXRD to \u03bcXRF, the elements, like phosphate and sulfur, exhibit a strong corelation to fibrillar tau. To complete our characterization of the pathological pathway of Tau pathology, we propose to measure six brain regions from three patients at different stages of disease by \u03bcXRF at ID21 and \u03bcXRD at ID13.","3528":"Zinc dyshomeostasis (deficiecy) contributes to the etiology of autism, although the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Our research consortium has identified the Zn-protein Prickle 2 (Pk2) as a critical neuronal polarity determinant and has shown that it participates in the early assembly of the axon initial segment. Pk genes are strong autism and epilepsy candidates. The aim of this experiment is to test the hypothesis that Zn homeostasis and Pk2 signalling converge during the formation of the axon and its initial segment. Thanks to the nano-correlative imaging of metals and proteins in neurons that we developed using STED super resolution microcopy and synchrotron nano-XRF, we will compare the quantitative distribution of Zn and Pk2 clusters in the axon initial segment at different stages of neurodevelopment. These results will serve as basis for further studies on Zn supplementation in Pk2 depleted models for the treatment of autism.","3529":"Transition metals, such as iron and zinc, play essential roles during infection. Our work focuses on the eukaryotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii, a ubiquitous\r\npathogen of humans and animals, which needs to subvert transition metals from its host cells to power the parasite's replication. We have identified the proposed iron\r\ntransporter, but recent work suggests it also has a role in zinc uptake. In this proposal, we seek to confirm this, and determine for the first time how T. gondii infection alters the quantity and localization of both iron and zinc in human cells. Recently, we have also created two parasite lines deficient in putative copper transporters and we plan to compare copper localisation in these cell lines to identify the first potential Toxoplasma copper transporters.  This work continues our recent, successful visit in May, expanding on these results to fully determine the role of iron at this host-parasite interface.","3530":"Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide, and current efforts to develop better therapeutics for heart failure have been held back by limited understanding of the normal control of contraction on the timescale of the heartbeat. Here we will use time-resolved ultra-small and small-angle X-ray diffraction at ID02 on whole beating hearts isolated from the rat to determine the relationship between the mechanical function, changes in the structural unit of striated muscle, the sarcomere, and the associated dynamic structural changes in the constituent myosin and actin filaments in situ.","3531":"Nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as promising tools in combating the global challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) by potentially serving as drug-delivery carriers or targeting agents. However, despite their potential, gaps in understanding the nano-bio interface hinder their translation into clinical trials. This study aims to address this gap by elucidating the mechanisms underlying the action of NPs on Escherichia coli (E. coli), a model organism for Gram-negative bacteria. Utilizing X-ray scattering techniques at the ID02 beamline, our research seeks to uncover the inner structure of E. coli and analyze how the incubation of NPs disrupts it, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the interaction between NPs and bacterial cells.","3532":"Breast cancer (BC) is the most diagnosed cancer worldwide, with its metastatic form being a primary cause of mortality. Understanding metastasis is crucial for devising effective interventions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression and metastasis but the lack of efficient and standardized isolation and characterization procedures limits their study.\r\nThe proposal aims to characterize BC EVs isolated through a microfluidic approach with varying purity levels and preservation methods using X-ray scattering. The objective is to assess the impact of purification and preservation procedures on EVs, considering both structural aspects and their ability to interact with DMPC vesicles.\r\nThis research aims to provide crucial insights for future investigations into the interaction of selected EVs with more complex target membranes. Ultimately, it will contribute to unraveling the mechanisms governing metastasis in BC for developing new treatment strategies.","3533":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes\r\nin the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the\r\nnumber of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament\r\nactivations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use\r\nsarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to\r\ninvestigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3534":"Therapeutic proteins are often stored as frozen drug substance to limit degradation of the expensive raw material between large campaign production and final\r\nproduct processing. Despite slowing overall degradation rates, the freezing process and subsequent storage impose several stresses on the protein, leading to\r\nunfolding and affecting the colloidal stability in the freeze concentrate (FC) by changing protein-protein interactions (PPI), ultimately leading to aggregation.\r\nThe proposed SAXS\/WAXS study will continue LS3210, in which formulation and freezing process-dependent differences in protein-protein distances (PP\r\ndistances) in freezing solutions and corresponding FCs were studied.\r\nOur study aims to expand a comprehensive understanding of protein behavior in the FC to enable a more rational formulation design. We aim to analyze PPI\r\n(reflected by S(q)0) in protein solutions of increasing total solid content and extrapolate the net interparticle interaction behavior to the FC.","3535":"With rapidly accelerating climate change, populations of many marine species are at high risk, especially slowly reproducing apex predators like sharks. Growth bands in shark vertebral centra are used to estimate age, and numerous sub-bands exist, confounding band counts and negatively affecting population estimates and fisheries management. Centra consist of mineralized trabeculae of 4.5-13 \u00b5m thicknesses, and varying trabeculae thickness\/spacing produces growth band contrast and the transition between microstructural zones. Whether crystallographic texture also varies across bands or other transition zones at the trabecular level is unknown. 3D, quantitative texture maps resolving individual trabeculae will improve understanding of shark growth and of centrum mechanical functionality. Tensor tomography with 3 \u00b5m sampling at ID-13 will be applied to shark centra tissue from species of two phylogenetic families.","3536":"Solid assemblies of organic compounds often include some inevitable misfit between constituents, giving rise to geometric frustration. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In this  project, we already applied the BCDI method (ID01) to follow the evolution of lattice distortions in a slender protein single crystals formed by a living organism. However, due to the slender nature of the filament, this successful experiment provided us with only strain tensor in a cross-section of the filament at different heights. We apply for ID13 micro-beam experiment to follow the evolution of average lattice distortions in 3D and to complete the project. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also demonstrate the role of spontaneous processes in biological tissue formation.","3537":"   Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many critical cellular processes. We have used laser-induced release from a caged, inactive form of ATP (NPE-caged) followed by short X-ray pulses at the dedicated time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) beamline ID09 at ESRF-EBS to study protein conformational change in real time. Because the NPE-caged ATP releases on a millisecond timescale, our studies have so far been blind to sub-millisecond structural intermediates. We now propose to use a different chemistry of the caged ATP (pHP-caged) that releases ATP in nanoseconds. We will track sub-millisecond domain movements and kinetics in calcium transport (skeletal-muscle SERCA1a and bacterial LMCA1) and in enzymatic energy conversion by adenylate kinase. The results will enable characterization of the faster events not characterized in solution for these proteins, can potentially revise earlier observations, and set a novel standard for TR-XSS experiments with caged compounds.","3538":"G-quadruplexes (G4) are non-canonical DNA structures involved in important cellular regulatory functions in various genomes, correlated with their folding mechanism. Therefore, the design of small ligands capable of modulating G4 formation\/stabilization is of growing interest for the development of new anticancer therapies. In this context, the reversible control of G4s using bistable photoswitches offers promising prospects for applications in photopharmacology but remains largely unexploited. The present project aims to characterize the dynamics of structural changes in G4s triggered by a functionalized azobenzene photoswitch (AZO1), using time-resolved solution X-ray scattering (TR-XSS), an ideal probe to capture changes in DNA 3D conformation. While the properties of AZO1\/G4 complexes have been characterized at equilibrium, TR-XSS studies will provide crucial information on non-equilibrium DNA structural changes that will serve as a benchmark for optimization of G4 photoswitches.","3539":"We will use time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) to study the pH sensitive ion channel KcsA. An earlier experiment at ID09 (LS-3224) was very successful, with changes in the X-ray scattering observe when UV light was used to release caged protons, thereby jumping the sample from pH 7 (neutral) to pH 4 (acidic).  We will build from this earlier experiment to test if point-mutations that inactivate the enzyme also suppress the observed conformational changes. Since the release of photocaged protons is very fast, we will also collect data for early-microsecond delays, aiming to measure the rise of the pH induced conformational change in KcsA. Finally, we will reproduce the pH induced conformational change in KcsA using a mixing flow-cell, with the goal of developing a generic approach to TR-XSS. Our studies of KcsA mutants will provide new structural insight into the transition from a closed to an open conformation of this highly studied potassium channel.","3540":"The cell interior is a complex environment characterised by molecular crowding and spatial confinement that affect chemical\/thermodynamic equilibria. Our  hypothesis is that cell conditions can also affect out-of-equilibrium structural dynamics. Phytochromes are photoreceptors regulating signalling responses in plants  and microorganisms, initiated by photoconversion of red light-absorbing (Pr) state to an active far-red light-absorbing (Pfr) state. We have demonstrated that  time-resolved X-ray scattering can be successfully applied to monitor hemoglobin dynamics within intact erythrocytes. The main objective of this proposal is to  apply the in-cell TR-XSS approach to unravel how cell conditions affect the kinetics and dynamics of functionally relevant structural changes triggered by light  in phytochromes. The proposed experiments will deliver the first in-cell description of the photoconversion pathway accompanying the signalling mechanism of  phytochromes.","3541":"Organometallic gold complexes bearing biphenyl and diphosphine chelating ligands of the general formula [(C^C)Au(NHC)(PR3)]+ present variable antiproliferative activities depending of the PR3 ligand considered. We could evidence by  cryo-XRF microscopy (ESRF, project LS-3277) the variable gold uptake and intracellular localization depending of the PR3 ligand after 4h incubation. However, we evidence by cryo-XAS spectroscopy the complete similar metabolization of each complex after the same incubation time (ESRF, project LS-3235). We now apply for beamline time at FAME UHD to perform cryo-XAS measurements on cancer cells treated with our gold complex for shorter incubation times (30 mn and 1 h) to study the kinetics of cellular metabolization in relationship with the phosphine ligand. This would represent the first structure-speciation relationship study of gold(III) complexes inside cancer cells. This project is financially supported by ITMO Cancer (project Goldspec no. 23CP039-00).","3542":"A necessary metal that is toxic in excess, copper induces adaptive responses in bacteria. Bacterial resistance or tolerance to this agent has thus become a problem in healthcare and agriculture. We identified a new mechanism for copper adaptation based on post-translationally modified peptides called \u2018bufferins\u2019 that enhance bacterial growth in the presence of excess copper, through the formation of complexes with copper. Our objective is to exploit X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy to investigate the copper binding site of bufferins in order to gain insight into what is likely to become a new path toward bacterial resistance.","3543":"The signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) forms reversable bonds with the heme unit of nitrophorins. We suggest to perform Nuclear Inelastic Scattering experiments with very high resolution on the nitrophorin from the European bedbug Cimex lectularius in order to clarify the mechanism of stabilisation of Fe-NO via heme protonation. ","3544":"The Lower Cretaceous was a period of major evolutionary innovation for plants and animals, especially in wetlands. The Las Hoyas fossil site (125\u2013129 Mya) provides an exceptional record of this, preserving a nearly complete wetland ecosystem with detailed bone and soft tissue fossils.This project focuses on reconstructing unique integumentary microstructures from two Las Hoyas fossils\u2014a triconodont mammal (Spinolestes) and an undescribed maniraptoran dinosaur\u2014using X-ray phase-contrast imaging. Both fossils exhibit extraordinary soft tissue preservation, with keratinous structures about 400\u2013500 \u00b5m in size. In Spinolestes, these \"protospines\" have unknown structure and functions, while the dinosaur's structures are completely new to science. By scanning and reconstructing these structures in 3D, we aim to uncover their function, providing insights into the animals' evolution and ecology, while deepening our understanding of integumentary complexity in early mammals and dinosaurs.","3545":" We recently discovered new well 3D-preserved jawed vertebrates in two Paleozoic (540-240 Ma) deposits, one in Uruguay, the other in Peru. Exceptionally, in addition to some muscles associated to the head, we found a mineralized brain in a cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays and chimaeras) and probably in a stem jawed vertebrate placoderm. Only two previous cases of vertebrate fossilized brains were documented to this date, and these new remarkable preservations of species that lived during an important evolutionary radiation of modern jawed vertebrates will provide new characters documenting the early stages of the still debated morphological evolution of the vertebrate head and central nervous system","3546":"The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. However, an increasing number of studies suggest that cerebral insulin resistance may play an important role in the development and progression of AD, and that insulin treatment can improve cognitive performance, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of this hormone. Using X-ray phase contrast tomography, this proposal aims to investigate the morphological effects of an insulin treatment - a candidate therapeutic intervention for dementia - on AD mice. We will investigate changes in the neurovascular network, A\u03b2 plaques and cellular microenvironment of the brain in AD mice treated with insulin. In addition, given the research highlighting the important role of the gut in insulin resistance and AD development, we plan to simultaneously investigate possible structural changes in the gut.","3547":"The goal of this project is to generate the first combined structural and elemental 3D data of frozen-hydrated brain tissue at the nanoscale. For this, we will prepare high pressure frozen tissue preserved close to the native state and we will acquire both cryo X-ray holotomography and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) tomography on the same specimens. By mapping the intracellular 3D distribution of key elements (Fe, Ca, K, Zn, P, Mn, Cl) within neurons and astrocytes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, combined with ultrastructural imaging, we can gain insight into neuron-astrocyte interactions. After X-ray cryogenic imaging, we will heavy metal stain and embed the tissue in resin for further assessment. Besides the technical advances, this work aims to enhance our understanding of neurons and astrocytes connectivity and function, contributing valuable insights to neurobiology and connectomics.","3548":"A wide range of molecular gold compounds display cytotoxic properties and may in turn provide safer and more efficient alternatives to clinically approved platinum based anticancer drugs. In this context, structure-activity relationship studies we performed on an array of cationic biphenyl gold(III) complexes with a carbene-pyridine chelating ligand showed a marked dependence of both the antiproliferative property and the chemical reactivity on the nature of the C^N ligand. We now wish to examine by nano-XRF the impact of the C^N ligand of 3 representative gold complexes on the distribution and concentration of gold in cancer cells shortly exposed to each of these complexes at biologically meaningful concentration. Correlative fluorescence microscopy of cellular organelles with multicolour staining dyes will warrant precise location of gold and other heavy elements in cryo-fixed cancer cells","3549":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) research aims to understand its pathogenesis for better diagnostics and treatments. Neurons, reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy, are severely impacted by mitochondrial dysfunction, closely linked to AD. A key feature of AD is amyloid aggregates, mainly A\u03b2(1-42) peptides, accumulating within neurons early in the disease. These soluble A\u03b2 oligomers trigger mitochondrial OXPHOS hyperactivity, possibly causing oxidative stress. However, their structure inside mitochondria remains unclear. Using advanced X-ray fluorescence imaging and tomography at ID16A, we aim to map amyloid assembly and explore its impact on mitochondrial function. This, along with label-free 3D nanoscale imaging, could reveal the role of metal ions in neuronal cells, connecting mitochondrial respiration to fibrillation. Insights could aid in diagnosing, delaying, and preventing AD. Preliminary data show promising results.","3550":"Climate change-induced lower and irregular rainfall, along with high evapotranspiration rates, contribute to soil salinization. This leads to reduced plant growth and yield losses, with rice (Oryza sativa), a staple crop, being particularly sensitive to salinization compared to other cereals. Developing resilient rice varieties is therefore imperative. Na+ transport and allocation are crucial in salt stress tolerance, with High-affinity K+ Transporter proteins (HKTs) playing a key role. Current methods to detect Na+ toxicity in plants, like inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry, are destructive and lack a comprehensive Na+ profile at the cellular level, limiting our understanding of Na+ allocation across tissues. This project aims to profile Na+ at the cellular level in different rice varieties and also generate elemental profiles for Cl- and K+ to enhance our understanding of salinity responses.","3551":"Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are essential micronutrients for plants, playing critical roles even in reproductive organs of plants, such as the pollen-bearing anthers.  Our team has developed single-cell ICP-MS and metal staining methods, which, along with other researchers' work, have demonstrated that the accumulation of Fe and Mn in flowers is genotype, age and growth condition-dependent. Pollen grains are the organs most strongly accumulating Mn that further increases with flower maturation. We have found that mutations in the NRAMP5 transporter, which mediates the efflux of Mn and Fe from the trans-Golgi network, cause defects in pollen transmission (unpublished data). What remains to be determined is the exact location and species of Mn and Fe before and during flower pollination. Our aim is to investigate the distribution and form of Fe and Mn in wild-type and Mn\/Fe transporter mutant flowers of Arabidopsis thaliana plants at tissue and subcellular levels using \u00b5XRF and \u00b5XANES.","3552":"The aim of this project is understanding how tobacco plant roots grow towards sources of Zn, an important nutrient for plants. While plants are known to move their roots towards important nutrients like nitrogen, how they do this for metals like Zn is not well understood. Our previous studies showed that about 60% tobacco plants can direct their roots towards Zn when it's in short supply.\nWe hypothesis this behavior may be linked to changes in the plant's cell walls, which could cause the roots to growth towards Zn sources. To explore this, we will grow tobacco plants in a controlled environment with low Zn and then introduce a Zn source. By using advanced imaging techniques at a synchrotron facility, we'll map where and how Zn accumulates in the roots and study the chemical changes involved.\nUnderstanding this process could help improve how crops absorb Zn from the soil, which is important for both plant health and human nutrition, especially in areas with Zn-deficient soils. \n","3553":"Magnetoreception is important for animals by helping them orient and navigate by sensing the Earth's geomagnetic field and is widespread across various species. However, locating magnetoreceptors has been notoriously challenging, previously described as searching for \"a needle in a haystack\u201d. We believe X-ray fluorescence imaging (XRF) offers significant advantages over visible light microscopy or electron microscopy, including a broader field of view and element-specific detection. The goal of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of using XRF to detect and map the distribution of magnetite in bees. If successful, this approach could accelerate research by providing a comprehensive map of magnetite distribution in animal bodies, guiding further investigations at the molecular and cellular levels.","3554":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools.","3555":"Muscle contraction is regulated by both Ca2+ dependent thin filament activation and mechanosensing-based thick filament activation. Evidence is growing for  the involvement in thick filament regulation of the cytoskeleton protein titin, which runs from the midpoint of the thick filament to the end of the sarcomere, and the  myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C), which is bound to the backbone of the thick filament in the central one-third of either half filament and bridges thin and thick  filaments. We use X-ray diffraction to investigate MyBP-C role in inter-filament communication and titin role in thick filament mechanosensing. The experiments,  conducted in intact frog skeletal muscle fibres, exploit the finding that X-ray fine structure of myosin based reflections reports the footprints of both MyBP-C and  titin and represent a testbed for future investigation on skinned fibres and whole muscles of rodent models with mutations in specific proteins.","3556":"Bone is essential for human health and wellbeing due to its central role in the musculoskeletal system. Bone is continually remodeled to maintain bone performance. At the border between old and new bone, cement lines occur. Cement lines are only a few microns across and their composition differs from that of the surrounding bone. However, their structure remains unknown. This information is important for understanding both bone mechanical properties and the signals that govern the behavior of bone cells involved in bone remodeling. Since bone is a 3D composite, the structure must be mapped in 3D. This has recently become possibly by new techniques developed by the proposers. We thus propose to conduct combined SAXS tensor and texture tomography to map the orientation distributions of, respectively, nanostructural features and the bone biomineral nanocrystals. This will enable forming a structural model of cement lines for the first time. ","3557":"The proposed research aims to determine mechanistic effects of therapeutic compounds aimed at treatment of heart failure. We will specifically determine the activating shifts in kinetics and structural dynamics induced by these compounds on ATP-dependent calcium transport. This transport is carried out by SERCA proteins and is essential to heart muscle relaxation and has been identified as central to heart failure, which today is the leading cause of hospitalization world-wide. The proposed research constitutes a novel approach to track mechanisms of action of activating compounds with therapeutic effects for heart failure, which paves way for development of \u201csmart\u201d drugs with high specificity. Such drugs would enable immediate and non-invasive administration at hospitals and have potential for long-term usage to improve cardiac performance.","3558":"Chelating carbene-pyridine based organogold(III) complexes of general formula [(C^C)Au(C^N)]+ present antiproliferative activities from the low micromolar to the submicromolar range. Their mechanism of action is currently being investigated as they are potential anti-cancer agents. We observed a clearly different chemical reactivity and cytotoxicity among members of this family, which was related to the nature of the carbene and the N-donor ligands. We previously demonstrated the possibility to identify the speciation of gold(III) phosphine complexes by cryo-X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy on beamline BM16[2, 3]. We now apply for beamtime on BM16 to perform cryo-XAS measurements on cancer cells treated with three different [(C^C)Au(C^N)]+  complexes to draw relationships between intracellular speciation, anticancer properties and chemical reactivity.

The major drawback for use in products remains their low ductility (at room temperature). Because of the lack of atomic long range order, these materials are intuitively not expected to undergo modification of their mechanical behaviours with down-sizing. However, atomic-scale deformation events are suspected to play a key role in the unexpected capability of metallic glasses to deform plastically when designed in the form of very small samples, such as thin films, without any clear general consensus concerning the fundamental mechanisms. This proposal combines the mechanical characterization of ZrNi thin film metallic glasses (TFMG) in tension with the unique nano-diffraction strain mapping technique available at ID01 to study the fundamental mechanisms governing the deformation of metallic glasses, more specifically at the sub-micron scale.","3594":"We propose to explore the origin of an interesting stripe strain network we have recently discovered inside  ferroelectric barium titanate oxide (BTO) nanocrystals. These strain stripes support the existence of local rhombohedral polar nanoregions (PNRs), not reported in nanocrystals before. We plan to use Bragg coherent X-ray imaging (BCDI) to study the temperature dependence of these PNRs in our sample. The 250nm single crystals are an ideal size and have internal 50nm well-defined strain stripe domains networks which are resolvable by BCDI at ID01.  Crystals will be first selected at room temperature, then ramped up in temperature to cross the ferroelectric phase transition at 413K where the PNRs are expected to vanish.  The evolution of the PNRs and reversibility of the network formation will thus be tracked in a single nanoparticle.  The nanomaterial has potential in ferroelectric memory applications.","3595":"The excellent high temperature mechanical properties of Ni-base superalloys come from their microstructure composed of strengthening precipitates coherently embedded in a solid solution (FCC) matrix. Understanding the mechanisms governing the dissolution and the precipitation of the \u03b3\u2019 phase is therefore essential to predict the microstructural changes that can occur over its lifetime. In this proposal, we intend to image the evolution of the strain distribution associated to the formation and the dissolution of \u03b3\u2019 precipitates using scanning X-ray diffraction and Bragg ptychography. ","3596":"This proposal aims to utilize Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) at the ID01 beamline to understand the mechanism for self-organization of gas bubbles into superlattices in selected metals. 3D coherent x-ray diffraction patterns will be used to image Gas Bubble Superlattice (GBS) structures and gain quantitative information on the noble gas bubbles in GBS, such as a change in lattice parameter and strain induced in a variety of metals with a combination of isotropic and anisotropic elastic properties and diffusion mechanisms (interstitial atom versus cluster diffusion). The effect of implantation flux, fluence, and temperature on the formation and structure of GBSs within a Fe, W, and Mo host matrices will be investigated to uncover mechanistic insights into the formation process and reveal how host-guest relationships evolve based on structural transformation.","3597":"We aim at studying the internal structure of ferroelastic domains in GeTe thin films and their dynamics under thermal annealing. In order to correlate the local structural properties with the ferroelastic domains dynamics we plan to carry out in situ X-ray diffraction experiments using a 70x70 nm^2 sized X-ray beam.\r\nBy mapping the sample surface using the scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) technique as a function of temperature the evolution of domains shape\/size will be correlated with their internal structure (strain field, rotation) with high spatial resolution. These experiments will eventually leads to a better understanding of the microscopic processes that influence the dynamics of the domain walls.\r\n","3598":"We recently developed a heat treatment based post-synthetic treatment on ZIF-8 membranes, leading to dissociation of methyl group from the linker (2-methylimidazole) and a formation of linker vacancy defects, which manifests into the shrinkage of lattice parameter by up to 1%. As a result, unprecedented H2\/CH4, CO2\/CH4, and CO2\/N2 selectivities of 170, 32.5, and 29.3, respectively, were achieved. With this significant effect of the heat treatment of ZIF-8 films on the gas-diffusivity, this proposal aims to gain in-depth understanding of the thermal-treatment led structural transformation in MOFs. We seek to decouple strain in the supported polycrystalline film from the lattice shrinkage and generate high precision data correlating lattice parameter to gas diffusivity. Further, we seek to understand whether or not such lattice parameter changes will take place by RHT-led controlled linker modification in a wider range of MOFs (ZIF-67, ZIF-90, ZIF-7) to tune the gas diffusivity.","3599":"We will study two Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) CsxCoy[Fe(CN)6] and RbxMny[Fe(CN)6] which show temperature- or light-controlled magnetic switching due to the spin-crossover present in this materials. The previous studies have identified the presence of hexacyanoferrate vacancies as a key condition for observing the spin-crossover, as the vacancies provide the structural flexibility allowing to accommodate atomic rearrangements required for charge transfer. In our previous work, we have shown that vacancy distribution Prussian Blue Analogues is not random and can be affected by the crystal growth conditions. Thus, the goal for this work is twofold: first, to identify the chemical parameters that affect local structure in the most significant way; second, to exploit the effect of different types of disorder on spin-crossover, in particular, the temperature of the phase transition.","3600":"We aim at exploring the stability of ordered arrays of supported tiny Pt clusters under pre-catalytic conditions (i.e. exposed to low pressures of O2, CO, CO+O2 and increasing temperature). We already showed that Pt clusters organize on a template consisting of a thin alumina film on Ni3Al(111) with a density 3 or 9 times higher than palladium, depending on the growth conditions. These tailored ordered arrays open the way to explore the emerging topic of single-atom catalysis by using surface science techniques in order to understand the link between atomic-scale properties and catalytic performance. By combining GISAXS and GIXRD to in situ monitor the clusters' growth and (dis-)organization, we intend to i) follow the structural and morphological evolution of the clusters arrays and the substrate when exposed to gases and ii) determine the pressure and temperature limits up to which catalytic studies can be performed, while keeping a good spatial organization.","3601":"LAM is a transformative technology enabling layer-by-layer fabrication of complex components. However, when this process is applied to nickel-base superalloys components, the mechanical integrity is plagued by hot-cracking. These detrimental features originate in the chemical composition imbalance at the solid-liquid interface causing the liquid and solid phases to coexist over a wide temperature range during solidification. This is further exacerbated by the volumetric shrinkage and intergranular stresses introduced by the fast-moving laser. Discovering the mechanism for hot-cracking remains challenging due to the transient nature of the process and the resulting micro- to nanoscale microstructure. Here, we will develop a correlative materials characterisation route combining 3D nano-computed tomography (with 10 nm resolution), Electron Backscatter Diffraction and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy to establish the conditions that trigger crack initiation from a LAM process.\r\n","3603":"Zirconium continues to be the primary structural material for use in nuclear reactor cores but prolonged exposure to the reactor environment leads to the absorption of hydrogen and eventual precipitation of hydrides. The presence of hydrides can lead to failure of fuel cladding if handled incorrectly and continues to be a concern in post use fuel transportation and storage. Previous in-situ SXRD studies have shown the evolution of lattice strains of up to 25,000 microstrain within hydrides which is at odds to its expected brittle nature. It has been hypothesised that a stress induced phase transformation in the hydride is responsible for the unusual lattice strain development however, others believe this response is due to load shedding from the matrix to the hydride. An investigation is proposed where the phase stability and size effect is utilised to identify the mechanism resulting in the unexpectedly large lattice strains observed in the hydrides.

Here, we propose to take advantage of ID11\u2019s unique capability to map the 3D distribution of crystallographic phases and measure 3D stress states at high spatial resolution. This will be applied to a crystalline multi-phase grain network to generate microscale detail from prototype alloys. Specifically, data will enable failure prevention strategies based on impurities concentrations in the recycled materials.

This is an opportunity to optimize the grain texture of materials to fit with higher load specifications. \r\nHowever, grain texture governs the mechanical fields at the grain scale. So, it is primordial to know how these mechanical fields are modified by the novel texture that it is possible to generate thanks to AM. \r\nTo do that, the evolution of strain partitioning through grains will be studied with 3DXRD method after different number of fatigue cycles.\r\nFurthermore, DCT experiments are an opportunity to create numerical clones of 3D 316L microstructures obtained by AM in order to use it in finite element simulations to predict the areas of fatigue crack initiation.\r\nThe coupling of these two methods is the key to understand the strain partitioning in AM microstructures and its role on fatigue crack initiation.\r\n","3610":"Reducing emissions from civil aviation through increasing the efficiency of aeroengines requires the development of new alloys with superior mechanical properties and temperature capability. Recently, we have developed a novel class of dual-superlattice superalloys, which offer exceptional properties. However, their further development requires a detailed understanding of the effects of alloying additions on the stability and precipitation sequences.  In this experiment, powder diffraction data will be acquired from six Ni-base superalloys, assessing the effects of Fe, W, Mo, Nb and Al additions on the solvus temperatures, lattice parameters and volume fractions of the precipitates.  These data will be obtained through dynamic measurements during heating and cooling between RT\u20131000\u00b0C.

The high-resolution diffraction will be used to provide well resolved superstructure peaks in the modulated martensitic phases enabling atomic positions and space group of the martensitic structures to be determined. At the same time temperature dependent XAFS will find local anti-site bond distance and disorder to understand local distortion in the present of austenite and martensitic phases, which will help to know the magnetic transition, favouring a high magneto-caloric effect.

Varying these concentrations allows modifying properties of TiOy, and one of the ways to do this is to apply extreme conditions like high pressure (HP) and\/or high temperature (HT). Besides, also nanosize effect can influence behavior of structural vacancies. Thus, within this project we want to study nanocrystalline TiOy at extreme conditions.

This reduction is caused by increasing the surface to volume ration and increase the phonon scattering. Nevertheless, the direct measurement of the thermal conductivity in these nanostructured thermoelectric materials is quite challenging, and the comparison between different morphologies is within the detection limit of actual experimental systems. Therefore, we have developed a theoretical model of the phonon transport along any nano-structure . In this sense, we plan to obtain the actual nanostructure of the 5 types of nanostructure currently grown in our laboratory by means of ptychoragphy measurements,to fed the theoretical model.

We propose to perform a quantitative characterization of the 3D microstructure of the nests with high-resolution by near-field X-ray ptychographic tomography. This will allow us to quantify the composition of the nests based on electron density values, and to analyze the wall structures and pore network with sufficiently high resolution to resolve small pores. The results will help us to understand the impact of the nest architecture design on CO2 exchange, ventilation, and thermoregulation. Additionally, this study may contribute to saving this endangered bee species (Megachile pyrenaica).","3628":"Immobilisation of enzymatic cascades in porous materials is ideal to perform multi-enzymatic biotransformations in industrial settings. Yet, they suffer from exhaustion processes that hampers their use for long operational periods. The exact mechanism of inactivation is unknown until now, but spatial re-organisation of enzymes across the material or loss of metal ions from their active centers seems to be relevant. Unfortunately, optical microscopy is not ideal to study those events, as labelling enzymes with fluorescent tags can alter their catalytic properties. We intend to acquire X-Ray Fluorescence maps at ID16A on methacrylate beads carrying a cascade formed by Zn and Cu-dependent enzymes used to transform diols to relevant lactones, both before and after their operational run. This will provide valuable information on the importance of enzymatic re-organisation and metal leaching for the deactivation of immobilised multi-enzyme systems upon operation in chemical manufacturing.","3630":"We want to witness continuously the dynamical morphological degradation and lithiation process in next generation Si (Gen2-Si) -composite anode lithium-ion cells with cycling.

During H-DR, the volume mismatch between the educt and product phases results in the generation of a large number of pores. Thorough time-resolved 3D characterization of the porosity and the connectivity of the free volume is highly needed for understanding their effects on the reaction kinetics. Hereby, we propose to employ in-situ high-resolution X-ray computed tomography enhanced by phase contrast to fully disclose and quantify the evolution of local microstructures during H-DR of iron oxide, in particular, the size, morphology, distribution, and 3D connectivity of porosity.

A recent work suggests that the formation of a hybrid (macromolecular + colloidal), possibly biaxial, N phase is crucial to get a stable casting solution and, upon drying, composite polymeric films with highly enhanced mechanical properties. Beyond its technological relevance, studying this system is also interesting from a fundamental perspective, as it could represents a rare example of the much sought-after biaxial N phase and, as such, an ideal system to test the predictions of theoretical models. This goal is made experimentally challenging by the hybrid nature of this system, with its constituents exhibiting LC order at very different length scales, nanometric for the polymer vs. micrometric for the GO platelets.","3636":"We propose to use operando micro X-ray diffraction (\u03bcXRD) to follow the depth-resolved lithiation state of graphite electrodes and possible lithium plating occurring during fast charging. Since heterogeneous lithiation and Li plating result in premature electrode ageing, there is a crucial need to experimentally probe these phenomena and to numerically predict their occurrence and magnitude. We have addressed the latter by developing a physics-based Newman-type performance model [2], the accuracy of which has been experimentally verified at the macro and micro scale for moderate C-rate using the feedback from our previous synchrotron experiment on ID13 (MA4110). To go further, we now require new experimental data (i) to adjust the performance model for the fast charge regimes, and (ii) to quantify lithium plating through the electrode thickness as function of the local state of graphite lithiation. This will provide a sound basis for accurate prediction of electrode ageing.","3637":"Functional properties of power MOSFETs depend decisively on residual strain fields across near-surface transistor cross-sections, which are accumulated during multiple processing steps, decisively influence thermal fatigue and modify the devices\u2019 performance as well as predetermine their lifetime.

While tension is the classically used loading mode, pure shear has a more pronounced effect on the bandgap of silicon as revealed by ab-inito DFT calculations. A challenge in deforming thin films under pure shear is to experimentally characterize at the nanoscale the strain field of the deformed area which has to be similar to the film thickness.

They are foreseen for the catalytic Sabatier reaction, in that CO2 will be reduced to methane. Moreover, the X-ray K-absorption edges of Ni and Cu are close-by to each other. Therefore, only ASAXS is able to enhance and vary the contrast between Ni or Cu dominated structural parts, to distinguish between alloyed or core-shell structures. Moreover, the overlapping anomalous of the anomalous scattering effects of Ni and Cu will allow to understand these more complex behavior and to test newer theories.

While this material is characterized by the cubic structure at room temperature, it undergoes a signifcant structural change, compatible to an incipient cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition, in a temperature range comprised between 250 and ca. 500 \u00b0C. The aim of this proposal is to perform dark field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) to investigate these distortions, by probing local orientation and strain variations within individual grains. We expect that this, coupled to results from a previous XRD experiment, will demonstrate the existence and stabilization of single-phase high- and medium-entropy oxides in the tetragonal phase.

Using dark field X-ray microscopy at the ID06 beamline, the evolution of crystals' orientation across the grains and the formation of strain concentrations as well as grain boundaries will be characterized. For this purpose, a dedicated experimental setup including a power supply, a function generator and custom heating MEMS with Cu lines will be used.

Persistent slip bands (PSBs) are one such structure, although imaging of these defects has conventionally been performed on single crystals through transmission electron microscopy. In this proposed experiment, we will use a combination of 3DXRD (HEDM) and DFXM to characterize the mosaicity and elastic strain state of a fatigued specimen, in order to identify the 3D structure and micromechanical fields around a PSB which will help elucidate the drivers for fatigue failure. Prior work, by the PIs performed a similar experiment on a Ni-based superalloy, requiring an extraction of the grains of interest.

With the use of nanoscope and extremely brilliant X-ray we indexed different phases of zirconium hydrides within zirconium matrix and we were able to measure lattice parameters and orientations for the zirconium matrix. Such data will provide significant information regarding stress development around various forms of zirconium hydrides that form during operation of nuclear reactors. During this experiment we conducted measurements at room temperature, and for the first time, we increased the temperature to 400 \u00b0C to partially dissolve the hydride phase. This was done for one of the specimens, however due to lack of beam time, it was not possible to run the same experiment on the second specimen where the hydride phase is located at the interface of three grains.

With this proposal we aim to investigate the influence, at the microscopic level, of the most common additives used in the industry to tune the hydration reaction of bassanite to gypsum. Different stages of the hydration reaction will be studied using a 3DXRD and 3D-PDF approach, to follow the aggregation kinetics (crystal orientation, mosaicity) at different selected times during the crystallization process.

As UO2 is oxidised to U4O9 and U3O8, either during burn-up or long-term storage, the physical and chemical properties of the fuel are altered, reducing their performance and safety. Our recent lab-based work has shown that the UO2 (001) surfaces oxidise to form U3O8 (130) in a topotactic transformation. This study aims to investigate this transformation using in-situ x-ray diffraction measurements of a UO2 (001) single crystal thin film as it is oxidised by heating in an oxygen atmosphere. The high flux, and nm beam size at ID11 uniquely enable us to measure single crystal diffraction from such a small sample. These results will provide significant insight into the oxidation mechanism from UO2 to U3O8 and the structures of the intermediate stoichiometries.","3658":"All-solid-state Li-ion batteries are touted to be the battery of the future, providing higher energy densities while being intrinsically safe.  However, one of the major challenges is to harvest the full capacity of the electrodes and to maintain this over many charge\/discharge cycles.

To that end, we propose temperature-dependent diffraction (total scattering) experiments appropriate for pair distribution function (PDF) analysis in direct space. Structural analyses from Bragg diffraction show increasing rotational disorder of the polyanions and correlated increase in Na+ diffusivity with increasing temperature. However, Bragg diffraction elucidates only theaverage structure and cannot elucidate whether such orientational disorder is static  or dynamic  in nature and whether\/how it aids ion conduction. It is now time to answer this long outstanding fundamental question of the coupling between anion and cation dynamics in ion conductors, in view of its practical interest for the development of solid electrolytes for next-generation solid state batteries.","3661":"Refractory metal high entropy superalloys (RSA) show exceptional promise for high temperature service but the formation pathways that lead to their two-phase A2-B2 microstructures is unestablished. Current proposals include a spinodal process but an ordering reaction must also occur and direct identification of the transformation sequences, along with the key temperatures, is imperative to enabling the further developments of these alloys.

However, these fast cooling rates lead to the generation of both long-range residual stresses and short range intergranular and interphase stresses, the latter between the Al-alpha matrix and the Si eutectic phase. To this date, the role of the Al\/Si interphase stresses and strains is not well elucidated. In order to improve our understanding of the potential role of these short-range stresses on fatigue crack propagation, it is necessary to characterise their magnitude relative to the long-range stresses.

Experimental data on their growth rate is scarce but X-ray tomography appears to be the adequate technique to detect their initiation and to follow their propagation in metals. For that reason, a new in situ ultrasonic fatigue machine has been developed to detect and monitor the evolution of internal cracks in a cast-aluminum thanks to X-ray microtomography and infrared thermography. However, because of the material large grain size, the observed fatigue cracks possessed complex 3D shapes which were extremely challenging to model. Consequently, because this type of experiment remains the only one that can provide reliable experimental data on internal fatigue crack propagation, this proposal aims at using the same setup on Ti alloy specimens with a larger grain size to obtain smoother crack fronts.","3675":"In this proposal, we want study the plasma-material interaction in the context of lightning strike impacting aeronautical fasteners.

The proposed experiment will lay the foundation for the development of new methodologies for real time imaging of mineralisation via the use of liquid phase CXDI and initiating research for the development of dynamic CXDI.","3687":"Previously, we have designed a series of wedge-shaped amphiphilic molecules with a hydrophobic rim and a focal hydrophilic sulfonate group that can self-assemble into supramolecular columns, forming ion channels. With the increase of relative humidity, 1D channel morphology transforms into a bicontinuous cubic structure, while the ion mobility remarkably increases. In the present work, we will study the process of photo-controllable formation of ion channels in the thin films of the wedge-shaped molecules with introduced photochromic groups including azobenzene and diarylethene. The effect of external conditions on ability of those materials to form nano-channels with photo-sensitive conductivity will be analysed. Finally, the supramolecular structures will be arrested in thin films by polymerization of acrylic groups at the periphery. The ion conducting performance of thin films during photo-switching and polymerization will be investigated in situ with specially designed setup.","3688":"The proposal is focused on elaboration of basic principles for controlling the permeability of laminated two-dimensional membranes by external stimuli. Like a pore diameter in conventional mesoporous membranes, d-spacing in 2D membranes determines their permeance and selectivity, thus enabling variation of membrane\u2019s separation performance with tuning their d-spacing by external stimuli. Utilization of the GISAXS technique is required due to typical ultralow thickness (20-100 nm) of 2D membrane selective layers. Experiment designed for determining the correlations between d-spacing of 2D smart membranes, type (electric or electromagnetic field) and power of external stimuli. Based on this analysis, the correlations between interlayer distance and substance permeance in 2D membranes will be established","3690":"The study is a continuation of our investigations on understanding mechanistic details of three-way catalysts by exploring the L edges of the noble metal components (previous proposal MA-4916 on Pd L edges). Hence, the aim of the present proposal it to conduct operando HERFD-XANES studies at Rh L edges for a Rh\/CeO2-ZrO2 three-way catalyst for elucidating: (1) the interaction of CO, C3H6 and NO with the noble metal under reaction conditions, and (2) performing spatially resolved measurements along the catalyst bed at selected temperatures during light-off \/light-out.","3692":"We propose to study the effect of multiple thermal cycling on the structure of the HgCdTe pixels using DFXM and micro-Laue experiments. In this follow-up experiment, we would like to statistically investigate the strain and orientation fluctuations in hundreds of pixels over multiple temperature cycles using DFXM, and correlate the strain states to the crystallographic orientation of the corresponding In bumps using micro-Laue experiment on the exact same sensor.\r\n\r\n","3693":"We aim to map the strain around spin CMOS compatible spin qubits at cryogenic temperature by Scanning Xray Diffraction Microscopy (SXDM). The qubits are housed in an epitaxial Si\/SiGe quantum well with lithograpically fabricated TiN electrodes on top. Spin qubits qubits are operated at temperatures T close to 0 K, while the local strains in the device will vary with T due to the different coefficients of thermal expansions of TiN compared to Si and SiGe. Strain fluctuations are expected to cause variations in the local electromagnetic potential in the QW, which will strongly influence the qubit performance. Thus SXDM measurements at low T, which are performed on a sample in a He-flow cryostat are necessary to determine the strain distribution during qubit operation. We will compare the experimental results with Finite Element (FEM) simulations based on an edge-force model, which will provide valuable insight for designing large qubit arrays with uniform properties. ","3694":"This proposal aims at studying the strain evolution in ferroelectric domains in the vicinity of domain walls in ferroelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thin films by scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) during the application of an electric field. SXDM provides access to the strain with a resolution of 10-5 and lattice tilt with millidegree accuracy while the spatial resolution is defined by the beam size. By measuring three independent Bragg reflections the complete strain tensor in the FE domains will be accessible. The consecutive measurement at different applied electric fields allows for imaging the strain evolution and domain switching close to the coercive field.","3695":"This proposal aims to utilize Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) at the ID01 beamline to understand the mechanism for self-organization of gas bubbles into superlattices in selected metals. The proposed nanoscale level elucidation of Gas Bubble Superlattice (GBS) formed in model systems such as Au and Pd nano and microcrystals will help elucidate the effect of finite size on GBS formation mechanism. We will use 3D coherent x-ray diffraction patterns to image GBS structures and gain quantitative information on the noble gas bubbles in GBS, such as a change in lattice parameter and strain-induced in gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and palladium nanoparticles (PdNP) of different sizes. In addition, we will compare the effect of radiation flux, fluence, and temperature on the formation mechanism and structure of GBSs within bulk gold with AuNP. Such a systematic study using model systems such as Au and Pd NP will unravel the role of finite size of NPs on the formation mechanism of GBS. ","3696":"One of the major technological challenges is the development of novel memory technologies that allow fast and energy efficient reading and writing of information. Magnetic materials allow to solve this challenge by employing exotic and stable chiral and topological magnetic states such as spin spirals, skyrmions and bubbles. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often responsible for such topological magnetic states. DMI manifests traditionally at metallic ferromagnet\/heavy-metal interfaces, owing to inversion symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling by a heavy metal. Our recent experimental observations suggest that Neel type skyrmions and bubbles can be induced even in rare-earth yttrium iron garnet (YIG) at room temperature through application of alternating magnetic fields. Here we propose to use resonant X-rays at forbidden reflections (where we are sensitive to the charge, magnetic and orbital ordering) to understand the underlying mechanism.","3697":"We aim for a non-invasive, microscopic characterization of lattice strain that is introduced into silicon by Si-nitride based stress liners for the purpose of enhanced carrier mobility in modern FET devices. An observed disagreement between strain values obtained from simulation and electron diffraction measurements may be attributed to the destructive preparation that is required. Therefore we propose to perform nano-beam scanning X-ray diffraction measurements as the only non-destructive technique to image the strain distribution of buried layers","3699":"Ce-stabilized zirconia (CSTZ) presents very interesting opportunities as a ductile ceramic that does not suffer from low-temperature degradation. It is known that this ductility arises because of martensitic transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) but the microscopic mechanisms at the origin of the onset of the transformation and the influence of different factors such as stress magnitude, crystal orientation are still unknown. In this experiment we want to spatially-resolve strain, crystal orientation and phase, and dislocation nature using micro-Laue diffraction on CSTZ micropillars which have been compressed at different levels of plastic strain. The results of such an experiment will be very valuable for the understanding of TRIP in CSTZ.","3701":"In the field of nano-optics, the Van der Waals (VdWs) material \u03b1-MoO3 can host directional phonon-polaritons (PhPs) with in-plane propagation owing to its highly anisotropic crystalline structure, which finds very interesting applications for light-matter interactions. In this regard, both developing practical strategies to introduce controlled strain fields in nanomaterials to reversibly vary their crystalline structure (i.e., in-plane propagation direction of the polaritons in \u03b1-MoO3) and a precise quantification of the strain field in terms of magnitude and anisotropy are fundamental. In this proposal, we aim the in-situ measurement of changes in the crystalline structure of thin \u03b1-MoO3 crystals (thicknesses from about 50 nm to 100 nm) induced by strain fields introduced in the crystals employing hybrid VdWs-piezoelectric devices. For that we propose to measure Laue diffraction patterns at the micro-Laue setup of BM32.","3702":"In this experiment, we aim to measure the strain at the micro-scale in novel silicon micro-\/nano-structures for (opto-)electronic applications. We propose to use X-ray Laue micro-diffraction combined with energy resolution, using an additional Silicon Drift Detector and\/or the \u201crainbow filter\u201d technique developed on BM32, to measure simultaneously the distribution of the lattice tilts as well as all the components of the full strain tensor, to validate the very high strains detected with indirect techniques. ","3703":"An original method of compliant epitaxy, Nano-Pendeo Epitaxy, has been developed for achieving low dislocation density GaN and managing the strain in the nitride layers. Initial thin AlN and GaN layers are grown on silicon on insulator (SOI) layers, before being patterned into nano-pillars. The degrees of freedom in rotation acquired by the nano-pillars allow the crystallites to realign crystallographically at the time of coalescence, without creating any defects. This alignment is explained by a reduction of interface energy between adjacent crystallites. To go further in the mechanisms at work and feed our numerical simulations, we would like to perform Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM). The large field of view (FoV) of the microscope shall allow us to statistically measure over a large number of pillars, while the fine spatial and angular resolution of the microscope shall allow to systematically study the structural differences between the center and the border of each pillar.","3704":"Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) is a promising technology producing highly complex, near net-shape components. However, LAM components suffer from detrimental quality issues governed by the rapid solidification process and localized thermal contraction. The resulting textured columnar grains and significant inherent residual stress directly influence the static and cyclic mechanical properties. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) alloys, which can produce a non-textured fine-grained microstructure due to the multi-phase transformation during layer-wise AM process, provide a potential mitigation to LAM challenges. However, the phenomenon is poorly understood and therefore can only crudely be exploited because no one has been able to observe the microstructures layer by layer in 3D. Here, we propose to use Dark Field X-ray Microscopy and the capability of in situ observation to understand the mechanism of cyclic microstructure transformation of TRIP steel during LAM process. ","3705":"The two mains points of this proposal are in one hand to focus on coupling in-situ 3DXRD and DCT-Topotomography methods to index the martensite M18R phase and to link the behavior of the grains to the microstructural environment of the SMA (size and shape of the grains, shape of the grain boundary, neighborhood...) and in other hand to test the new algorithms for DCT grain reconstruction to improve the grain morphology and reveal orientation and strain gradients within the grain.","3706":"Martensitic phase transformation (MPT), a diffusionless solid-to-solid phase transformation, is the enabling mechanism behind the novel behaviors of shape memory alloys (SMAs). However, functional fatigue\u2014changes to the material during cyclic loading that diminish its exploitative properties\u2014continues to be a major technological barrier. Functional fatigue is caused by dislocations that generate as a result of the MPT. Here, we plan to test a new hypothesis on the role of \"microstructural repeatability\" of the MPT. We propose a multiscale, multimodal experiment during stress-induced MPT cycling using novel lightweight Mg-Sc SMAs as a model material. The initial microstructure will be measured using DCT. The increase in dislocation density will be characterized in individual grains using XRTT, and these functional fatigue related quantities will be correlated with microstructural repeatability using 3DXRD. ","3707":"718 alloy is the most used Ni base superalloy in industry due to its high manufacturability and high resistance in extreme conditions. However, when subjected to very high stress, it is reported that this alloy can suffer from embrittlement by a Stress Assisted Grain Boundary Oxidation (SAGBO) mechanism at high temperature. In this proposal we will focus on the kinetics of the rate limiting crack coalescence stage of this damage mechanism and study its sensitivity to microstructural parameters such grain size, texture and precipitation state of the material. For this end, we will perform time-lapse observations of crack coalescence under load at 650 C, using phase contrast tomography. The initial and final 3D grain structure of the samples will be characterized by DCT. Digital volume correlation will be used to quantify the deformation of the material and results will be compared to crystal plasticity and phase-field simulations on the digital twin of the sample volume.","3709":"The aim of the current proposal is to probe the structural integrity (stability) and uniformity of variously treated Ohara superionic lithium ion conductors. XRD-CT will be applied as a structural probe with \u00b5m spatial resolution. Phase composition, structural parameters and details of microstructure will be determined using reconstructed diffraction data for each voxel. Macroscopic structural features of lithium transport and its effect on the morphology are planned to be obtained and correlated to bulk electrochemical characterisation and nano-CT.","3710":"The compound LiBH4:3LiNH2 is thought to be the determining factor in high hydrogen ab- and desorption rates of a complex hydride hydrogen storage candidate. Recent QENS measurements showed that the hydrogen mobility increases already below the material's melting point to liquid-like values. This measurement aims to elucidate the structural mechanism behind this phenomenon.","3711":"Al alloys are widely used for light-weight structures and components. When processed by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), an additive manufacturing (AM) technology, high-strength Al alloys show sharp hot-crack sensitivity. A common approach to overcome this problem relies on the use of Ti- and Zr-based inoculant phases to form fine equiaxed grains to better accommodate solidification strains. Ti and Zr modify severely the aging behaviour of the alloys, thus new heat treatment routes have to be designed. Here we plan to perform in-situ time-resolved XRD analyses on Al-Cu-Mg-Zr and Al-Cu-Mg-Ti-B alloys to investigate the microstructure and precipitate evolution following different heat treatment routes. Residual strain mapping will be also performed at RT on the same materials after different annealing schedules. The achieved results will be useful for the AM industrial and scientific community to design new high strength Al alloys for L-PBF processes and their relative heat treatments. ","3712":"The iron-based shape memory alloy (FeMnNiAl) exhibits desirable pseudoelastic properties across a wide range of temperatures. Accompanied with high transformation stress magnitudes, this material system holds significant potential for applications requiring high work output levels. However, the alloy also exhibits pronounced grain size dependance which is not well understood. In addition, challenges associated with the functional response under cyclic loading have been reported for this system. Despite notable progress in advancing and optimizing the cyclic properties of this system, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding regarding the metallurgical phenomena ruling the functional fatigue properties of FeMnNiAl. This work aims to address this aspect by providing a deeper insight into the source of functional fatigue through in-situ identification of phases and lattice microstrains during cyclic loading.","3713":"Nickel-rich Li(NiMnCo)O2 (NMC811) have emerged as the most promising successor to LiCoO2 cells, and could potentially facilitate ubiquitous adoption of lithium(Li)-ion batteries in mobile and transport devices. However, NMC811 suffers from instability at high voltages which contributes to significant capacity loss, with the underlying degradation mechanism being poorly understood. We propose to use the capabilities of ID15-A to perform a complete in-situ structural study employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pair-distribution-function (PDF) computed tomography (CT) to elucidate a full understanding of the heterogenous structural changes throughout the electrode. During cycling of the cells, we aim to obtain spatially-resolved data to understand how local nano-crystalline phenomena propagate the onset of inactive phases, and how the thickness of the electrode promotes regional chemical environments facilitating inhomogeneous cell activity with complimentary tomographic techniques.","3714":"The goal of this project is to characterize the silica nanocylinders filled with water and ions having various chaotropic and kosmotropic properties with total X-ray scattering coupled with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis as well as appropriate modelling. The results will give structural information such as the density profile within the pores and enabling a better fundamental understanding of the structural properties of water confined in the presence of ions in nanoconfinement.","3716":"Current interferometric gravitational wave detectors (VIRGO, LIGO) rely critically on the use of ultra\u2013stable Fabry\u2013Perot cavities. In these systems, a fundamental limit to the inherent performance is set by the thermal noise associated with the dielectric coatings of the cavity Bragg mirrors. Very frequently the mirrors in such applications consist of multilayers of a low refractive index material, such as amorphous SiO2, alternating with a high refractive index material, which is often amorphous Ta2O5. Unfortunately the local structure of a-Ta2O5 has not yet been fully characterised. There is a growing interest to study partially crystallized a-Ta2O5 (where nanocrystallites are formed) as a material with improved mechanical performances. Our aim is thus to investigate the thermal evolution of the local structure of a-Ta2O5 thin films by time\u2013resolved pair distribution function analysis and the crystallization kinetics as well.","3717":"Over the last decade, solar cell devices based on halide perovskites have seen a dramatic increase in power conversion efficiency and stability in large part due to compositional mixing of prototypical MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 systems (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium). Indeed, one state-of-the art formulation is (Cs0.05FA0.78MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3. However, mixing components of different sizes is likely to result in local strain fields emanating from the substitution site, which have not yet been adequately characterised. Evidence suggests that strain in halide perovskites adversely affects device efficiency and stability, so understanding the local strains induced upon compositional mixing is of paramount importance. The PDF measurements on APbBrxI1-x, APbBrxCl1-x, APbClxI1-x (A is Cs, MA, or FA) proposed here can uniquely characterise such local strain fields.","3720":"Understanding structural changes in materials possessing a magneto-structural phase transition is crucial to perceive the energy landscape during this phase transition. On a macroscopic scale, using simultaneous measurements of the electronic, magnetic and structural subsystem, we found a decoupling of the magnetic and structural subsystem during the change from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase in FeRh. Besides the two-step transition, strain measurements indicate the presence of an intermediate tetragonal distortion of the sample. Thus, we intend to perform high-resolution XRD measurements along the temperature-induced phase transition to observe whether the Bragg peaks split (confirming the tetragonal distortion of the lattice) or not (changes in the microstructure caused by tetragonal distortions). These results will help identify the lattice transformation pathway during the first-order phase transition and identify the driving force of the phase transition.","3721":"Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are being rapidly implemented for fabrication of structural components. To ensure that the resulting AM materials\r\n can repeatedly meet performance requirements, an improved understanding of the microstructural response to heat treatments is required. Since the nature\r\n of the AM process results in high thermally driven residual stresses due to rapid solidification, the first stage of heat treatment in AM is typically a stress relief cycle\r\n which has been\r\n seen to change of the texture, affecting the strength. The aim of the experiment is to understand the mechanisms driving these texture change in the Nickel based\r\n superalloys IN718 produced by the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (AM) process during the stress relief heat treatment . This experiment shall provide an insight\r\n intothe mechanisms causing these microstructural changes by simulating the heat treatment conditions and following the microstructure evolution in-situ.\r\n","3722":"\u03b2-calcium orthophosphate and calcium orthovanadate (Ca3(XO4)2, X = P or V), are known to crystallize in R3c space group. A small fraction of Ca atoms can be replaced by other ones, of valences from +1 to +4, without a change of structure. We are interested in studying of the new whitlockite material, Ca10.5-xNix(VO4)7. We already determined structural properties at room temperature. The aim of proposed study is determination of thermal expansion at LT (that is not studied yet for the family of whitlockite-related materials), and atomic displacement variation of different cationic sites. It leads to take a look deeply on type of disorder and modelling of the temperature variation of atomic displacement, separately for each cationic site.\r\n\r\n","3723":"Zirconium alloys are widely used in the nuclear industry due to their low neutron capture section and good resistance to corrosion, irradiation and creep. The\r\nmicrostructure of the Zr nuclear rector components evolves all along the manufacturing route and depending on process parameters it can impact the subsequent\r\nprocesses or the final component properties. It is therefore necessary to understand and master the structural evolution to increase the quality of the material. It\r\nis experimental evidence that recrystallization of the Zr-2.5Nb alloy containing metastable beta-Zr phase is very difficult if the material was not highly deformed. For finding the optimum processing route a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon is necessary. The aim of the present proposal is performing an in situ analysis of the recovery and recrystallization for understanding the role of the stored energy and of the beta-Zr to beta-Nb transformation on the recrystallization process.","3724":"X-ray diffraction was used to study solid-state phase transformations, lattice strain evolution, and evolution of crystallographic defects and texture due to Solid-State Thermal Cycling (SSTC) in situ during Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) of Ti6Al4V. To perform the experiments we have developed a novel mini-LMD machine dedicated to synchrotron beamlines. Microstructure evolution due to SSTC during LMD of Ti6Al4V using different LMD parameters and residual stresses measurement in each sample after cooling down to room temperature were investigated.","3725":"Cu-based electrolyzers allow high-rate CO2 electrolysis (CO2E) to value-added chemicals. However, they still suffer from a lack of stability and high selectivity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) instead of CO2E. Both issues are believed to be due to insufficient water management. Our theory is that too high a water content in the catalyst and gas diffusion layer is limiting CO2 mass transfer, leaving HER as the only feasible reaction. While our previous work (MA-4791) showed water transport with CO2 electrolysis, the dominant anions are carbonates, and thus the main ion transport through the membrane is carbonate ions. With this proposal, we wish to employ CO electrolysis, as that has similar catalysis as CO2E, but is expected to have vastly different water flux due to hydroxyl groups being the dominant anions. In this proposal, we aim to analyze water flux with COE and relate this to variations in catalytic selectivity as well as relate it to our previous work of CO2E.","3726":"Operando sub-microfocus XRD\/PDF\/SAXS studies will be performed to obtain information about the chemical composition of interfacial phases formed on steel by novel vanadium lubricant additives, under friction conditions in a tribological contact. Vanadium(IV) oxyacetylacetonates are a new class of lubricant additives that achieve a remarkable reduction of friction and wear in engines, with potential to replace conventional zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) lubrication technology. From X-ray scattering in a bespoke environmental tribometer we will seek to identify interfacial phases formed by complex mechanochemistry, as a function of time and friction conditions. XRD, SAXS and XPDF will provide combined information about ordered, disordered and colloidal phases. Our study builds on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, which indicate the presence of phases of three V oxidation states (III, IV and V) but do not identify the actual vanadium phases.","3728":"Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) is an enabling technique. L-PBF components occasionally show poor performance, which are originated from appreciable residual stresses introduced by solidification cycling. For steel, the volume expansion associated with displacive phase transformations provides a potential solution to mitigate residual stress development during initial manufacturing. However, multi-phase transformation phenomena cannot be fully evaluated by  traditional a posteriori techniques due to their transient nature, necessitating in-situ characterisation. Here, it is proposed to use ID31\u2019s high energy range to perform a three-step XRD study to understand the complex relationship between residual stress development and phase transformations in this manufacturing process. We will perform both ex-situ and in-situ synchrotron XRD on steels manufactured by L-PBF to elucidate and quantify the mechanism of residual stress reduction by phase transformations.","3729":"Rising interest for beyond von-Neumann logics has led to the development of artificial synapses for neuromorphic computation using memristors as functional elements. Due to their adjustable resistance, the modulated synaptic weight of bio-synapse can be performed, making them suitable for learning and memory functions. In the last few years, special attention has been drawn to the use of perovskites (such as manganites or nickelates) as memristive layer due to their tunable ionic and electronic transport properties.In this context the main objectives of this proposal are to: 1) experimentally measure chemical changes related to the resistive switching (RS) behaviour of Pt\/La2NiO4+\u03b4\/TiN memristors with different oxygen content and thickness, and 2) temporarily observe the chemical changes in each of the layers related to cycling, potentiation, depression and relaxation functions by operando XANES \/electrical measurements.","3730":"EuFe2As2 is an interesting compound of the 122 series because of the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism originating from Eu2+ that has spin-only magnetic moment of 7\u00b5B. In normal state EuFe2As2 exhibits two magnetic transitions. The first one at \u2248190 K concerns the AF ordering of the spins at the Fe sites, while the second one is observed at \u224820 K and involves the ordering of spins on Eu2+. The spins of Eu order in an A-type antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering (the ordering is AF between different layers but ferromagnetic inside a single Eu plane). This additional magnetic phase and the constant presence of high magnetic moment on the spacing layer do not preclude the emergence of superconductivity (SC) when doping is performed, representing one of the few cases in which ferromagnetism and SC are close in the phase diagram of Fe pnictides. This leads to the natural question of whether the high magnetic moment of Eu2+ affects the magnetism of the FeAs layer. ","3731":"This proposal aims to gain significant insight in the energy storage capacity of a new type of all-solid-state oxygen ion batteries, by studying the local chemical and structural changes of the electrode. We will determine the cation valence states of three promising thin film oxides (LSC, LSF and LNO) by in situ XANES as a function of electrode polarisation, temperature and time, which in combination with complementary ex situ analysis will allow us to advance the understanding of potential-dependent oxidation states, segregation and short-term degradation phenomena, necessary to boost battery capacity and lifetime.","3732":"In this proposal we aim to study the magnetic and the electronic properties of unexplored 1,2,5-benzothiadole\/CuCl2 ((btd)\/CuCl2), 1,2,5-benzothiadole\/CuBr2\r\n((btd)\/CuBr2) and 1,2,5-benzoselenadizole\/CuCl2 ((bSed)\/CuCl2) single crystals organic-inorganic hybrid coordination polymers, using soft x-ray absorption\r\nspectroscopy. These are molecule-based magnetic compounds exhibiting the coexistence of different magnetic orders. The goal is to establish the relationship\r\nbetween antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) orders in these compounds probably related to the presence of helimagnet spin order as observed in\r\nfull-inorganic anhydrous cupric halides parent compounds. To verify this picture, we propose to measure magnetic circular and linear dichroism at the Cu L2,3\r\nedges on hybrid single crystals.","3734":"Here we aim to provide a fundamental understanding of the complex changes occurring in the local electronic and geometric structures of electrocatalysts active for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) under real working conditions via operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The electrocatalyst materials under investigation are transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon support (Cu-NC and Fe-NC) that are able to efficiently reduce nitrate to ammonia, a valuable chemical product that is used heavily in the agricultural industry. By investigating these materials in several different pH-environments, we can gain much-needed insight into the electronic and structural changes that dictate the electrocatalytic behavior, which will ultimately help guide the rational design of NO3RR electrocatalysts.","3735":"We propose to exploit high pressure - high temperature (HP\u2013HT) X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) to explore the local atomic structure around Zr in three Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), UiO-66, NU-1000 and MOF-808, in the HP and HT region. As part of the PhD project of Ms. G. Robertson, this information will be combined with HP\u2013HT pair distribution function (PDF) results (scheduled as in house at Diamond Light Source) to deeply understand the P\u2013T-induced microstructural changes associated with the crystalline-amorphous phase transition in MOFs.   ","3736":"Information on the local scale and structural stability of cubic ABO3 perovskite still lacks systematic detailing.  BaZrO3 is a widely explored material for several applications due to its interesting properties. However, its structural stability under pressure still raises great doubts. This topic is considered a challenge, especially when related to the possible phase transition also at low temperature. The lack of detailed structural data along with the small amount of previous studies on the phase transitions of BaZrO3 makes this topic an interesting to be explored. Therefore, we propose here to study the phase transition under pressure Pm-3m to I4\/mcm in BaZrO3 perovskite and to probe its pressure-temperature phase diagram, considering runs at low temperature (10\u2012300K) and high-pressure (0\u20121Mbar). This will provide information on crystal structure stability of BaZrO3 perovskite.","3737":"We propose to investigate the role of Pt in the single-atom platinum-decorated cerium oxide nanoparticles as nanozymes. The objective is to characterize the local geometry of Pt species and the interaction between atomically dispersed Pt and CeO2. By measuring XANES and EXAFS at the Ce L3 and Pt L3 edges, we will study the coordination environment (geometry, oxidation states) of Pt to understand its interaction with the support as the active redox sites within the enzyme-mimetic application.","3740":"The failure of SA508 Grade 3 steel takes place by void nucleation, growth and coalescence mechanisms. The microstructural analysis found two different initiating particles, namely non-metallic inclusions and second phase particles. Our previous study revealed that these two particles show different contributions to ductile tearing mechanisms. Despite greater volume fraction of non-metallic inclusions, they surprisingly play no significant role in fracture initiation for low triaxiality cases. The study proved that ductile fracture is initiated by the coalescence of small voids nucleated from second phase carbide particles in every case. As structural materials are subjected to high triaxiality during their service life, the investigation of fracture mechanisms under high triaxiality loading is crucial. Our aim is to characterise the distinct behaviour of void initiating particles under such a high triaxiality loading similar to the service conditions of structural materials.","3741":"Two lead-free substitution alloys have been developed. We would like to see how they perform under real brazing: in particular the integrity of the interface with the substrate (presence of cracks or not) and when and how pores occur in the joint, because these are key points for their potential use for industrial applications. The number and the localization of pores are important since a certain level of pores can help for residual stress relief in the joint, but too many of them can lead to dramatic failure; the thermal expansion coefficient of the solder alloy has been chosen to be very close to that of the most used substrates, but the evolution of the microstructure at high temperature and the formation of intermetallics can be prohibitive for service life. It is thus crucial to carry out in situ X-ray microtomography during heating and cooling\/solidification to detect the presence of pores and cracks in the solder joints.","3743":"Unlike the classical fluid catalytic cracking, our novel ACM-101 catalyst is used in a multizone fluidized bed reactor for the direct cracking of crude oil, eliminating the preliminary distillation and hydrotreating steps. ZrO2 is incorporated to prevent coke formation during cracking, leading to durable catalytic performance while enhancing the yield of light olefins. Due to the complex multicomponent microstructure, X-ray nano-imaging is needed to characterize their microstructure. We propose to apply near-field PXCT to provide a high-resolution microscopic view of the microstructure of our ACM-101 catalyst particles for the first time. This will help: (i) understand the textural transformations during the catalytic process and catalyst deactivation during direct conversion of untreated crude oil to light olefins; (ii) identify the localizations of coke deposits; and (iv) understand how the cracking process can be accelerated, which can optimize their scale-up manufacturing process.","3744":"In this proposal we aim to investigate the 3D modulation of Mg in calcitic biomineralized tissues of the red algae. We have found\r\nvia aberration corrected HRTEM that varying concentrations of Mg exists within these biominerals in an alternating manner. However EDS in TEM is  not near as sensitive as XRF and cannot pick up small varientions. Moreover, TEM cannot reveal 3D modulations but mainly only 2D small slices. We would like for the first time to study these modulations in 3D. These modulations have implications in understanding the process of biomineralization (transformation of a Mg-rich amorphous precursor to a crystalline phase) as well as have strong affects on the mechanical properties. Such unprecedented 3D structural information due to nanotomography imaging coupled with Mg XRF will make it possible, for the first time, to localize the elemental distributions within the sample in 3D.","3746":"The aim of this proposal is the study of the distribution of Ge, Sb and Te and their segregation in a ternary Ge-Sb-Te phase change material (PCM) during heat treatment. Data will be collected in-situ with X-ray fluorescence and nano-X-ray diffraction (XRD) mappings during annealing at the ID16B and ID13 beamlines on PCMs. This will provide access to the elemental (Ge, Sb, Te) distribution in the material and the segregation mechanisms. A micro-heater-based furnace that exists at the beamline will be employed.","3747":"The CEA and the IRCER are interested in the 3D printing of ceramic structures in order to look for innovative heat exchangers applied to the energy transition. The chosen technique is stereolithography, which uses a polymer resin loaded with silica microparticles. To obtain ceramics, a heat treatment is applied to eliminate the organic part and to promote the formation of bridges between microparticles by sintering. In order to ensure the mechanical properties, it is important to control the heat treatment parameters (temperature, speed and heating time) as they influence the final microstructure of the ceramic object. The objective of high resolution tomographic measurements on beamline ID16B is to access the evolution of the microstructure (neck growth at the early stages of sintering) in situ at different times during the application of the heating profile up to 1000\u00b0C. This data will help to validate a model of sintering behavior using the discrete element method.","3748":"Silicon is a very promising anode material for increasing the energy density of Li-ion batteries (LiBs). However, the integration of Si anodes in commercial LiBs is very challenging due to the huge volume change of Si upon lithiation, affecting its cyclability. In a full cell, the volume variation of the Si anode is affected by the other components of the LiB (separator, cathode and casing), but to date, their impacts on the Si anode swelling and the resulting LiB cyclability are not well known. In this context, the goal of the proposal is to visualize and quantify the volume change of the Si-based anode by means of in situ X-ray tomography performed in a full cell configuration. The influence of the pristine cell pressure and anode porosity, which are essential parameters for commercial LiB manufacturing, will be studied. New strategies for a better visualization of the SEI and anode binder will be also evaluated. This study will give key information to conceive high performance LiBs.","3749":"We aim to investigate the structure evolution in suspensions of ultranarrow, monodispersed ZnS nanowires and nanorods in different solvents and concentrations. The hierarchical structure in this system starts from the atomic level structure of the Zn and S ions, through the molecular level structuring of their surfactant coating, and finally to the \u2018artificial crystals\u2019 formed by the nanoparticle assemblies. In addition to static measurements, dynamic SAXS\/WAXS \u2018snapshots\u2019 of select nanoparticle suspensions will be taken under shear flow. The SAXS\/WAXS setup combined with the shear cell at ID-02 is particularly suited for the above studies with d-spacing values ranging from few \u00c5ngstroms (atomic scale) to the order of several nm. The ultimate goal of the experiment is to correlate the hierarchical structure obtained from SAXS\/WAXS measurements with the optical properties (photoluminescence and optical absorption spectroscopy in the UV-vis) of the ZnS nanoparticle assemblies.","3750":"The final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in geological repository requires to understand its alteration and to determine the formation of secondary phases than can form at the interface between UO2+x and the solution at the equilibrium with the media. These nanometer-thick phases are complex to characterize by solution analysis and difficult to characterize since realistic flat surface at large scale is difficult to obtain after long term alteration by groundwater with UO2+x. The aim of this proposal is to use the direct proof of concept (Lu et al, submitted) to determine on absolute scale the reflectivity as well as the scattering produced by a dense packing of micron-sized grains. Thus, a combination of SAXS and WAXS will allow for the first time to in situ characterize the thickness of these neoformed phases using the reflectivity signal, the nanoporosity of the layer and the crystalline structure of these phases from the scattering signals at higher q on isolated grains. ","3751":"Nanoindentation is routinely used to determine local mechanical properties of materials like Young\u2019s modulus, hardness and fracture toughness. Currently, however, the models for the evaluation of the load-deflection curves suppose the application of infinitely stiff diamond indenter tip and neglect its elasto-plastic deformation. The aim of this proposal is to perform in-situ experiments using a custom micro-mechanical system developed for ID13, which will be equipped with a dedicated wedge tip. The in-situ scanning experiments on soft and hard samples thin films will be used to assess both (i) the stress-strain evolution across the samples under the indenter and, additionally, (ii) the stress-strain evolution across the wedge indenter tip. The experiment will be used to enhance the understanding of the elasto-plastic deformation in the indenter-sample system and, additionally, to refine the finite-element models used for the evaluation of indentation experiments.","3752":"Ordered quantum dots (QD) superlattices (SL) are promising systems for many new technological applications. Understanding their formation process from solution is fundamental to obtain systems with improved properties. In this proposal we aim to understand the formation mechanism of 3D superlattices of PbSe colloidal QDs occurring at the liquid interface by using in-situ GISAXS under controlled solvent evaporation rate. The goal is to explore the optimum conditions to achieve maximum order prior transfer to solid substrates. This proposal is the first step of a large project where we aim to form ordered 3D SLs of merged QDs for opto-electronic applications with superior lateral ordering.","3754":"Magnetic performance of nano-multilayer (NML) thin films is strongly influenced by multiple microstructural features.

In this work, we propose an in-depth investigation of diffusion\r\n mechanism and microstructural evolution in ion beam deposited (IBD) Fe\/Co NMLs on a Si substrate, by combining large scale averaging techniques such as\r\n synchrotron in situ X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and in situ grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) at elevated temperatures. Quantifying these\r\n material responses will reveal dipper insights on how and why the final magnetic performance of Fe\/Co NMLs is affected during annealing.\r\n","3755":"trontium deficient thin SrTiO3 films show resistive switching that is assumed to be related to ferroelectric antisite defects where Ti occupies a Sr position. With increasing deficiency, these defects form polar regions (domains) in the lattice that can be switched by means of an electric field. In our model, the orientation of the  spontaneous polarization defines the resistance through the film leading to the resistive switching behaviour. In this proposal, we want to verify the relation of ferroelectric and resistive switchen. In addition, we intend to determine the structure of polar defects in strontium deficient SrTiO3 as function of applied electric field . This will be done by a combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in-situ resonant X-ray diffraction (RXD).","3756":"This proposal aims to study the local structure of Pt particles dispersed on CaTi1-xFexO3-\u03b4, with x=0, 2, 3, 4, 7 during CO oxidation. This novel support material shows catalytic activities similar to ceria, converting CO already at room temperature. We believe that this high performance is due to the presence of both, Ti and Fe in the support and interaction with Pt and the support, via oxygen vacancies created through Fe-doping and\/or strong metal-support interaction (creation of Pt-Fe bonds). Using operando photon-in\/photon-out spectroscopy we will study the electronic structure and local coordination of Ti, Fe and Pt. ","3758":"Photon-in photon-out X-ray spectroscopy opens a road to study homogeneous reactions in solution of low concentrated samples in highly crystalline sample environments, where scattering investigation methods are facing limits. We propose to use the element specific in situ HERFD-XANES to track the nucleation of PtAg nanoclusters in ZIF-8 (PtAgNCs@ZIF-8) which gain high interest with promising catalytic properties. We would like to monitor that PtAg nanoclusters are growing inside the ZIF-8 by probing the Pt L3-Edge by checking a possible coordination of the PtAgNCs on the imidazole inside the ZIF-8. It enables to detect possible intermediate states and track the interaction between nitrogen and nanostructure at every step of the synthesis.","3760":"The study is a continuation of our investigations on understanding mechanistic details of three-way catalysts (TWC) by exploring for the first time the L edges of the noble metal components (proposal MA-4916 on Pd L edges) under in situ \/ operando conditions. With this proposal we aim at completing our operando HERFD-XANES study on Pd L edges for a Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 three-way catalyst under applied reaction conditions. In a similar manner, we would like to investigate Rh L edges for a Rh\/CeO2-ZrO2 TWC. The obtained results will help to: (1) uncover the interaction of CO, C3H6 and NO with the noble metals under reaction conditions, and (2) perform spatially resolved measurements along the catalyst bed at selected temperatures during LOff\/LOut for elucidating essential mechanistic aspects.

The synthetic and theoretical efforts focus on a wide range of nanomaterials with unique electronic properties as they carry on a potential to have impact on highly relevant societal themes ranging from electronic devices, energy conversion to energy storage. The particularly important recent examples include the transition metalchalcogenides (TMS), and nitrides (TMN). In this context studying the electronic structure of the central metal atom and differentiating between various metal ligands during synthesis has become of paramount importance for the chemistry of materials.\r\nThe new high-energy resolution emission spectrometers (microXES and tender) at ESRF enable in situ XES experiments with high energy, time and spatial resolution. However, what is missing is a dedicated sample environment for on-line monitoring of the syntheses of nanostructure in solution at the relevant conditions.\r\n","3762":"This proposal aims at studying the evolution of the complete strain tensor in an improper ferroelectric rare earth manganate lamella by scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) during the application of an electric field. SXDM provides access to the strain with a resolution of 10-5 and lattice tilt with millidegree accuracy while the spatial resolution is defined by the beam size. By measuring three independent Bragg reflections the complete strain tensor will be accessible. The consecutive measurement after different electric field pulses allows for imaging the strain evolution and domain switching close to the coercive field.","3763":"One of the major technological challenges is the development of novel memory technologies that allow fast and energy-efficient reading and writing of information. Magnetic materials allow solving this challenge by employing exotic and stable chiral and topological magnetic states such as spin spirals, skyrmions, and bubbles. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often responsible for such topological magnetic states. DMI manifests traditionally at metallic ferromagnet\/heavy-metal interfaces, owing to inversion symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling by heavy metal. Our recent experimental observations suggest that Neel-type skyrmions and bubbles can be induced even in rare-earth yttrium iron garnet (YIG) at room temperature through the application of alternating magnetic fields. Here we propose to use resonant X-rays at forbidden reflections (where we are sensitive to the charge, magnetic, and orbital ordering) to understand the underlying mechanism.","3764":"We propose full-field coherent diffraction measurements of polycrystal grains at a high beam energy, with the long-term goal of characterizing crystalline deformation across many length scales. We will exploit the enhanced beam coherence of the ESRF-EBS at high energies to make a combined DCT\/BCDI measurement at 33 keV. This will be a vital first step in developing a general capability to study crystalline materials simultaneously on multiple length scales varying from ~10 nm to ~10 um. A successful reconstruction will enable BCDI feasibility studies for large crystals, addressing issues like absorption and refraction. It will also bridge a critical gap in length scales currently separating coherence-based techniques like BCDI from conventional high-energy methods like DCT and HEDM.  Unifying these so-far separate characterization methods is crucial for future multi-scale synchrotron studies of polycrystals and grain boundary interactions.","3765":"(In,Ga)N alloy is a key material system for applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics. Despite more than 20 years of research, a remaining central problem is the achievable In concentration in films grown with a high structural quality on GaN. One approach towards higher In concentrations is to reduce the lattice mismatch via growth on plastically relaxed InGaN buffers. In this project, we plan to study the dynamics of plastic relaxation in InGaN buffers by in-situ X-ray diffraction microscopy during annealing. This way, we aim to understand the peculiar dislocation patterns occurring in relaxed InGaN on GaN.","3766":"We want to determine, by means of single crystal X-ray nanodiffraction, the relative amount of reversible and irreversible changes taking place in the crystal lattice of a few different materials as a consequence of X-ray irradiation. The importance of lattice heating will be addressed and compared to numerical models, gaining knowledge about the lattice temperature evolution, lattice damage and on the possible routes for defect engineering.","3768":"An original method has been developed for achieving low dislocation density gallium nitride (GaN) and managing the strain in the nitride layers. It is based on the self-realignment of Si(111) nano-pillars (NP) during nitride layer coalescence. This study has several goals: (i) determine the degree of tilt and twist of the individual Si NP induced by coalescence; (ii) obtain the in-plane and out-of-plane strain distribution for the GaN layer, which will give us further information about the threading dislocation density (TDD) in our platelets. We will study the coalescence process with the variation of the pitch (center-to-center distance) by testing samples with varied pitches but the same NP diameter. We also intend to study the layers for various GaN growth times in order to better comprehend each step of the GaN pyramid coalescence. These observations will provide a clear picture of the coalescence process which will be beneficial to grow GaN platelets with low TDD.","3769":"Mixed-halide perovskites suffer from light-induced segregation, forming halide-rich domains with different bandgaps. Local techniques show local heterogeneities in the distribution of halides, which may lead to local strain that initiates halide segregation. It was found that the halide segregation kinetics also depend on the type of cation. Mixing cations reduces halide segregation but it remains unclear whether this is related to a relaxation of the strain. In this proposal, we will use time-resolved WAXS experiments to get insights on strain effects on phase segregation and recovery as function of cation composition. We will investigate the effect of pressure on the strain in mixed-cation perovskites, which was not reported before. Finally, although bulk techniques suggest full recovery of halide segregation, it is likely that some heterogeneities remain on local scale. Therefore, if the SAXS\/WAXS is available, we will determine the local reversibility of halide segregation.","3771":"All-solid-state lithium ion batteries are promising due to high safety and energy density, but suffer from fatigue caused by mechanical stresses. Based on an experimental microstructure of a mixed cathode (LiCoO2\/Li7La3Zr2O12: LCO\/LLZO), we calculated the thermal stresses after manufacturing and the electrochemical stresses after charging to study the impact of microstructural parameters (LCO contents and relative density) on the stresses yielding a stress-optimised structure. Here, these stresses in complex cathode materials and their homogeneity will be measured including the two different stress components of manufacturing and charging. In addition, the stress development over the electrochemical cycling will be measured which will confirm the role of stresses in the degradation behaviour in traditional and optimised cells. This will be the first direct crystallographic stress measurement and it will help to overcome a remaining main issue of these batteries.","3772":"Irradiation of the first wall tungsten (W) materials by He is a crucial parameter to consider for the application of nuclear fusion to energy production, with one major consequence being the modification of the cristalline structure, along with formation and growth of He bubbles under the W surface. Complementary to post-mortem TEM and GISAXS analysis, this experiment allows the observation of the kinetics and dynamics of the He bubbles growth by in situ GISAXS measurements, along with characterization of their shape (e.g. faceting) from the form factor and the spatial distribution for the interference peak position. GISAXS measurements are complemented with GIXD to estimate the strain field induced by the bubbles in the subsurface region of the W crystal. For this proposal, we aim at getting closer to the experimental conditions in tokamaks, by studying the impact of W temperature during He exposure and incident He energies below\/above the displacement energy threshold of W by He.","3773":"In metal additive manufacturing, the large thermal anisotropy, which takes place during the deposition and the melting of the metallic powder, leads to anisotropic grain microstructures and highly heterogeneous precipitagtion. The knowledge of thermal, physical and metallurgical phenomena developing from the nanometric to the mesoscopic scale is essential to understand and model the behavior of these new class of materials, to develop alloy composition adapted to the thermal and mechanical loadings of components during service.

","3774":"This experiment aims to study static recrystallization in Mg-Zn-Ca alloys using in-situ 3D X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). Lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloys have enormous potential for reducing fuel consumption of transportation vehicles, but the poor formability of Mg sheet due to its strong basal texture has precluded its widespread use. Recent studies on Mg-Zn-Ca suggest that annealing can result in desirably weakened split-basal textures. Here, we plan to use a multiscale, multimodal approach to understand the role of recrystallized versus non-recrystallized (i.e., grains that existed from the as-deformed condition). Our two-part experiment plan consists of (1) collecting non-recrystallized vs. recrystallized grain evolution statistics using fast acquisition 3DXRD in the rolling, normal, and transverse directions, and then (2) \"zooming\" in to measure the evolution of non-recrystallized vs. recrystallized grains in high resolution using DFXM.","3775":"We can find metal oxides in numerous technological applications, from fuel cells to flash memory. Many of their physical functionalities are closely related to the point defects present in them. However, current methods used to characterize these type of defects are limited to sample surface or indirect measurements. In this proposal, we aim to directly map single standing defects in bulk complex oxides through the local strain fields they generate. This should be done at the DFXM at ID06 since it provides the strain sensitivity adapted to such fields. The combination of the experimental results with simulated 3D multiscale models will allow for quantitative estimation of defect density. This will provide the first of its kind measurement enabling direct visualization and quantification of point defect populations under real operating conditions.","3776":"Hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) is an attractive approach to mitigate massive CO2 emissions in the steel industry. During this solid-gas reaction, grain refinement and strain accumulation at the interphase boundaries occurs in solid oxides. Strain build-up leads to cracking and cavitation, which should be controlled. However, the interplay among phase transformation, strain accumulation, and defects formation is still not well understood due to the lack of 3D crystallographic information. Thus, this experiment aims to investigate the 3D orientation and strain distribution in solid oxides during HyDR. Here, we propose to employ interrupted in-situ synchrotron dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) to determine: (i) 3D orientation distribution of a selected hematite grain and its neighboring magnetite grains, and (ii) 3D strain distribution and evolution in selected individual grains of oxides along the reduction process.","3777":"High entropy (HE) alloys are developing these last years due to their interesting mechanical properties. They are composed of at least five chemical elements. On another hand, shape memory  alloys (SMA) exhibit specific superelastic behavior when submitted to mechanical loading due to a stress-induced martensitic transformation. New alloys combining HE and SMA effects have been developed: their mechanical behavior has to be determined at the grain scale to serve as further finite element modeling input data. So the aim of this proposal is to study the martensitic transformation of these alloys during an in-situ tensile test. ","3778":"Contrary to its huge industrial importance the theory of abnormal grain growth (AGG) of Goss grains during the recrystallization of electrical steels is still a matter of intense debate [1-6]. There are several theories aiming to explain the phenomenon, but there are no adequate experimental data corroborating them. In this proposal we aim to follow in situ by diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) and by high-energy diffraction the recrystallization behavior of such steel. By measuring the growth rate of about 10,000 grains it will be possible for the first time obtaining key information on the neighborhood and location of Goss grains and to link this information to their growth rate. The expected results can shed light on the physical mechanism, which is at the basis of this \u201cenigmatic\u201d industrial process.","3779":"Titanate-based materials have attracted attention for battery applications for ongoing decades due to their low cost and ease of processing.

Particularly Ln=La and Y, show reversible capacities of 130 and 160 mA h g-1, respectively. However, these materials have not yet been assessed in Na-ion batteries. Our work focuses on the study of these materials as negative electrodes (anodes) in sodium-ion batteries, where we have demonstrated reversible capacities of 120 and 100 mAhg-1 at C\/10, respectively. Nonetheless, the charge storage mechanism for sodium uptake and removal in these materials is unknown.

The goal of this proposal is the validation and improvement of micromechanical methods to estimate local stresses for anisotropic FCC and HCP polycrystalline materials. A particular focus lies on the Maximum-Entropy method (MEM) which is capable of predicting local stresses based on macroscopic mechanical properties and microstructural information. We propose to implement Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT) to determine the shape, arrangement, orientation and average elastic strain tensor of a representative ensemble of individual grains within a polycrystal for increasing tensile loading. Based on this unique experimental dataset, simulations and analytical methods can be combined to validate the MEM, yielding a new computationally extremely efficient approach for hierarchical materials informatics.","3783":"The BMG Ti40Cu36Zr10Pd14 grade has already been demonstrated as a material with very high potential for biomedical applications [1], [2] (mainly the manufacturing of dental implants). However, recently the presence of crystalline defects (called \u2018spherulite\u2019) has been observed in this alloy and it now appears essential to know the actual 3D distribution of spherulites in the manufactured parts. Indeed, we believe there is a critical spherulite diameter beyond which the parts break prematurely with a fully brittle behavior.. This synchrotron experiment should give us elements to rule on the influence of spherulites on mechanical strength and they should give us clues as to the cooling rates to be reached or the heat treatment to control their size\/distribution.

The recent breakthrough (8.4%) in Cu2O solar cell devices was possible due to fine-tuned chemical states by reduction of impurities, which are responsible for low carrier diffusion lengths. However, CuO impurities have been demonstrated to minimize interfacial defects, which points at a delicate balance between these phases. We aim to understand this detailed effect of impurity phases and oxygen vacancies by quantifying their respective number, sizes and position with respect to the interfaces of films prepared through a modified reactive sputtering process.

Specifically this study will identify changes in porosity and microcracks formation occurring in specimens upon CO2 exposure; elucidate carbonation extent of low carbon cements, tracing changes in pore structure and formation of crystalline reaction products (e.g. carbonate polymorphs) when exposed to CO2; and will aid validating\/ refuting existing carbonation mechanisms proposed for low carbon cements. These unique outcomes will enable optimisation of cement formulations for increasing carbonation resistance.","3789":"In engineering materials, martensitic transformation\/deformation twinning change the structure\/reorient crystal lattice, which is far less understood than dislocation slips. For nanocrystalline NiTi wires, we have recently developed a multiscale approach combining grain-level reconstruction of martensitic\/austenitic microstructures deformed by TEM SAED-DF method with deformation analysis from in-situ texture evolution. The former studies deformation in individual grains, while the latter studies the same statistically in thousands of grains upon synchrotron diffraction. We have conducted isothermal tensile tests, in this work we will perform in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction texture evolution experiments on two NiTi wires upon heating\/cooling\/loading.

In this project, the tempering kinetics of a nitrogen enriched multiconstituent steel (23MnCrMo5) will be examined in details by means of in situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Three main aspects of tempering will be analyzed: firstly, the identification of the formed precipitates (carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides); secondly, the sequence of precipitation as well as their nucleation, growth and coarsening kinetics during continuous heating and isothermal tempering; thirdly, the evolution of the retained austenite that depends too on tempering conditions. In addition to phase fractions, cell parameters that are correlated to chemical composition and internal stresses will be determined as well as dislocation recovery kinetics. ","3791":"We aim at measuring the thermal diffuse scattering in single crystals subjected to different heat treatment to analyse the precursor phenomena in the new all-d-Heusler magnetic shape memory alloys.

Practical realization of all solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with a Li metal anode and solid-state electrolyte (SSE) will be key to unlocking higher capacities. Currently, the primary challenge for ASSBs is their interfacial instability, which affects both safety and performance. Among SSEs, sulfide-based SSEs have the highest ionic conductivity, but a lower stability, in particular the propagation of instabilities from the anode\/SSE interface into the bulk. While their deleterious effects on cell performance and safety have been explored, their precise underlying mechanisms are yet to be understood. Here we propose to use microscale, operando XRD-CT to obtain structural and morphological information on the initiation and propagation of degradation in Li|SSE|Li cells.  Such an understanding of the nucleation and propagation of interfacial instability is critical in designing stabilization strategies to mitigate them.","3793":"The experiment is dedicated to the spatial mapping of phase transformation in superelastic NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) polycrystalline wires under general loading conditions during temperature-induced martensitic transformation coupled with large plastic deformation. It proposes to employ recently developed diffraction\/scattering computed tomography (DSCT) adapted by authors for experiments on NiTi SMA, which was found to provide unique data of evolving martensitic transformation in complex NiTi structures, where other experimental techniques (e.g. CT, DIC) fail. The main aim of this experiment is to extend knowledge of a newly observed TRIP mechanism in this important SMA material to general loading case, which can significantly contribute to development of advanced modeling tools for SMA applications.","3794":"We are currently studying new high entropy alloys as promising solid-state stores for hydrogen. These alloys quickly absorb H at STP conditions forming hydrides and they can desorb H by heating. Despite many similarities, the H absorption capacity is fading during H absorption\/desorption cycling for some alloys whereas for others it stabilizes at the first cycle. The reason of such behaviour is not yet known. We hypothesis that this might be due to the developing of short-range ordering by sequential cycling. Moreover, laboratory X-ray diffraction before and after cycling did not allow us to conclude about a possible structural change nor phase segregation. Thus, we propose to study here the local crystal structure in various compositionally complex alloys (five HEAs) as well as its change induced during H absorption\/desorption cycling by in situ X-ray total scattering and associated PDF analysis.","3796":"We propose the in-situ XRD study of the NASICON (NA Super Ionic CONductors) samples NaFeNb(PO4)3 and NaAlNb(PO4)3 considered as anodes for sodium ion batteries. Our electrochemical tests reveal good performances, but two main aspects are still undetermined: i) while the two compounds are isostructural, the electrochemical behavior is significantly different in terms of capacity and charge\/discharge profiles; ii) the electrochemically active species, unexpectedly is Nb. For these reasons, we aim to perform in situ XRD study to follow up the structural evolution of the systems, identify the Na ions site and occupancy, and determine the electrode reaction. The XRD data obtained from the optical cell will be analyzed according to the Rietveld method (determining the structure), with MEM and Frourier map methods (locating the Na ion sites). Data will be coupled with ex situ SEM\/TEM analysis, XPS, and possibly with XAS data and neutron diffraction data (proposals under evaluation).","3797":" We have recently described the short-range ordering due to Pb\/Bi\/vacancy substitution on the metal cation sites of the monodimensional lead halide pseudoperovskite (TMSO)3Pb3xBi2(1-x)I9. The clustering between defects occurring at the nanometer range is probably the cause for the appearance of very peculiar trapezoidal diffraction peak shapes on (hkl) peaks with non-zero h. We then developed a statistical model of disorder to simulate the XRD pattern and fitting to the experimental data, analogous to our earlier work on metals. The model fits well to laboratory data on a limited Q-range, but higher resolution on a wide range is needed to validate it and allow for reliable structure-properties correlation.","3798":"CuBi alloys are predicted to exhibit a giant Spin Hall Effect (SHE), making them a promising material for developing spintronic devices. However, variations in the composition and structure, e.g. crystallinity, crystallite size, formation of oxides or metallic clusters of Bi, can affect the spin hall angle, i.e. the efficiency of the spin-to-charge current conversion. Here, we will examine the structure and temperature-induced structural changes in nanowires of composition Cu1-xBix (x=0.0-0.1). These results, in combination with transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, will allow us to obtain an in-depth understanding of the structure of the system and corelate it to the transport properties.","3800":"The aim of the present proposal is to determine the composition dependence of the influence of pro-eutectoid cementite on the austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation in steels. Depending on composition and cooling rate, significant differences of precipitation are observed. For hot rolled steels, this proeutectoid cementite can change dramatically phase transformations such as the ferrite\/pearlite transition. For Advanced High Strength Steels, this precipitation plays a key role on the morphogenesis of the ferrite\/austenite microstructure formed during inter-critical annealing. This investigation will use a recently designed combinatorial methodology relying on compositionally graded samples and time- and space-resolved in situ high energy X-ray diffraction, which provides quasi-continuous maps of phase transformation kinetics in compositional space. This methodology will be applied here to evaluate the coupling between pro-eutectoid cementite and the ferrite\/pearlite transition.","3801":"The Li-mediated ammonia synthesis (LiMeAS) is currently the only proven way to synthesize ammonia electrochemically. However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood, with recent publications stating that the elusive solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer could be a very important factor. Similar to the battery literature, it is believed to prevent excess electrolyte decomposition and regulate the Li plating behavior. In the case of the LiMeAS the SEI layer may control the diffusion rate of the reactants, N2, H+ and Li+. In this proposal, we aim to fundamentally understand the SEI layer as well as the deposit of the electrode at different reaction conditions (electrolyte solvents, salts, current densities and pressures) and investigate how these changes influence the faradaic efficiency (FE). The expected results will help to further understand and improve the performance of the LiMeAs and bring us a step closer to a renewable ammonia production.","3802":" We propose studying simple electrode\/electrolyte interfaces with X-ray reflectivity (XR) to better understand structural motifs perpendicular to the interface. We expect that our results will significantly improve the atomic level understanding of the electrolyte\/electrode interface, in particular the arrangement and coordination of the ions and solvent molecules at the electrode interface as a function of potential. The coordination of the electrolyte is strongly related to its electrochemical stability. This is of utmost importance to understand the mechanisms involved in the solid electrolyte interface formation. Comparing our structural results with simulations such as molecular dynamics will allow us a deepen our insight into the structure of ions and solvents at electrified interfaces.","3805":"Developing rare-earth-free permanent magnets with competitive magnetic performance is a necessary step forward to enable an ecological transition based on clean energy generation and green mobility (wind turbines, e-vehicles). Our research group has recently patented a novel cold sintering method for fabricating rare-earth-free hexaferrite-based magnets, which allows reducing sintering temperature, and in turn, lowering the energy consumption in >30% compared to the sintering methods used in industry. We intend to replicate this process in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) and follow it in situ based on time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, with the aim of: (i) gaining a deeper understanding of the process itself and of the various phase changes undergone, (ii) refining the preparation method to better control the produced material, ideally further reducing the sintering temperature.","3806":"This project is aimed at systematically probe how the local atomic structure and chemical order at the atomic scale is related to the optical and thermal properties of SiGeSn thin films. Here we propose to carry out Sn-K edge EXAFS data on SiGeSn thin films deposited on Ge\/Si relaxed substrates by means of CVD or MBE. The deposition parameters will be modified in order to relate the Sn local atomic structure to the optical and thermal properties of the films.","3809":"Silver sulphide (Ag2S) quantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystal with outstanding optical properties as a broad absorption spectrum and narrow and tuneable emission in the Near-Infrared domain. Ag2S is a non-toxic material, which makes these QD eligible for in vivo imaging and drug delivery. However, their stability in biological systems and their biocompatibility need to be assessed before any in vivo application. We are currently developing Ag2S QDs with different sizes and coatings, in order to optimize their optical properties. We propose to make use of XAFS to investigate the stability of these different formulations in cellular models, including in 3D cell cultures mimicking the liver. This information, corroborated by their photophysical characterization and by cytotoxicity assays, will help us identify the best candidates for the development of nanoplatforms for imaging and therapy. ","3810":"Mixed-halide perovskites suffer from phase segregation when continuously illuminated resulting in halide-rich domains with different bandgaps, hampering their applications in real devices. Interestingly, this process is fully reversible in the dark. Halide perovskites are very soft, contrary to other semiconductors, and their properties are strongly correlated to their crystal structure. Mild pressures have been used to shift the compositional threshold for phase segregation. However, little is known about the origin of this shift and the activation energy for halide migration as a function of pressure is not yet reported. In this proposal, we will use high-pressure time-resolved (seconds to minutes) X-ray under segregation conditions to obtain the the activation energy of the segregation (in light) and recovery (in dark) in the range of 0 \u208b 0.45 GPa.","3812":"Laser-induced cavitation bubbles are centrally important in all applications of pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL), such as laser shock peening (LSP) or nanoparticle synthesis, and a thorough understanding of their dynamics is therefore crucial to improving their effectiveness. Despite the use of various optical imaging techniques in the study of laser-induced cavitation bubbles, it is still challenging to capture high temporal resolution images of the initial stage of bubble formation and final stage of bubble collapse at its minimum size, because these techniques are all affected by multiple scattering that can obscure the inner details. The present work aims to advance the understanding of PLAL by providing a detailed experimental observation of laser-produced cavitation bubbles close to a rigid boundary, through multi-frame MHz XPCI with high temporal and spatial resolution.","3813":"In the context of novel anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, SiOx\/C composites attained commercial acceptance by providing a better energy density. But they still lag in terms of cycling life due to the volumetric expansion on charge\/discharge. Our team develops discrete element method (DEM) based mechanical\/electrochemical coupled predictive models through which the design of the battery can be optimized. By using synchrotron source XRCT, microscale morphological transformations can be studied. A high resolution is necessary for the tracking of particle relative displacements and the retrieval of electrode phases. Physical hypotheses of our existing DEM models will be verified and optimized with the help of XRCT results providing insights into the estimation of binder damage and electrical network connectivity. This predictive model can be a crucial element in the development of battery technologies.","3814":"The lack of metallic materials tailored to the metallurgical conditions of laser-based additive manufacturing is still a critical bottleneck for this disruptive manufacturing technology. We are currently investigating a new Al-Fe-Zr alloy that has been specifically designed to exploit the rapid solidification nature of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). While preliminary laboratory investigations show that the alloy can yield mechanical performance beyond that of conventional Al alloys processed by LPBF, the fundamental mechanisms of nano-structural feature formation needs investigation at the nanometric level to fully understand and optimize processing and post-processing conditions. We propose a complementary experiment combining in operando X-ray radiography during LPBF (already carried out at ID19) with nanotomography at ID16A. The results will help reveal the underlying mechanisms governing microstructural formation and evolution during LPBF processing and subsequent heat treatment.","3815":"In this project, we propose to study the dissolution mechanism of Mn in the LMO active material over the electrode lifetime and the impact of the single particle crystallinity and coating for preventing it. Thanks to the high flux and reduced acquisition time brought by the EBS, it will be possible to address this problem thanks to 3D nano-tomography combined with X-ray fluorescence (XRF).","3816":"We aim to produce a comprehensive structural model for spinel-type high entropy oxides (HEOs), including possible selective ion clustering. This goal implies characterising the oxidation state, crystal field environment, and distribution of ions, with sub-micron spatial resolution, in the (CrMnFeCoNi)0.6O4 system. We have previously conducted X-ray magnetic circular dichroism on (CrMnFeCoNi)0.6O4, from which we know the ions are inhomogeneously distributed across the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel host, in contrast to the presumed random distribution in an ideal HEO. The results for (CrMnFeCoNi)0.6O4 will be compared to a reference rocksalt-type HEO, where only octahedral coordination is possible and random distribution of the ions is realised. This study aims to improve the structural understanding of spinel-type HEOs, to better tailor their functional properties which, due to their enhanced stability, are of technological interest in catalysis and energy storage.","3817":"The subject matter of the present study is the damage in lead-free piezoelectrics caused by X-ray radiation.

X-rays effectively interact with this type of materials, due to the photoelectric effect is intense at \u201clow\u201d photon energies (~Ti K-edge). Ti K-edge spectra are expected to present anomalous absorption intensities in some energy intervals and in some areas of the sample with high concentration of Ti and Ba and low concentration of Bi. This is linked with defects in the crystal lattice, which are mostly oxygen vacancies. These defects can alter their original properties after being damaged.\r\n","3818":"We aim at monitoring in situ and simultaneously the evolution of mechanical properties and of phase composition of several hydraulic binders, such as cements for bone reconstruction, during their setting. These materials experience a liquid-to-solid transition due to the dissolution of a reactive powder and the reprecipitation of more stable products. This class of materials has a huge technological and economical impact on our societies, mainly because of this setting process. Beyond construction industry, it allows to use bone cement in mini-invasive surgery techniques or to 3D-print implants that harden as soon as printed. Understanding the link between the evolution of rheological properties of the printed paste and the extent of its chemical reaction is therefore a key point. The results will thus bring critical information to understand the structure-properties relationship during the solidification, serving to refine cements formulation in various fields of engineering.","3819":"This study is part of a thesis that was awarded a CNRS grant (80\/PRIME). This experiment aims at filling the gap concerning the evolution of nano-oxides in 316L parts obtained by laser powder bed fusion with heat treatments in order to understand their contribution to strengthening. USAXS\/SAXS\/WAXS combined measurements are an opportunity to study, first, the evolution of size with heat treatment temperature and time, and secondly, the change of crystalline structure, both in a quantitative way. This characterization will provide the crystal structure, evidencing possible structure transitions of the precipitates during heat treatment, as well as their geometrical characteristics (size, size distribution and volume fraction). This data will be of high value to understand quantitatively the mechanical properties of the built parts and optimize their heat treatment.","3820":"Glycyrrhizin (GA) containing hydrogels are used in wound healing applications since the GA increases the wound healing speed. GA forms hydrogels by an entropically-driven self-assembly into large cross-linked structures in water.1 These large structures are rapidly formed and contain fibrillar building blocks.2 Up to now, it is unclear how these fibrils self-assemble into larger constructs and how they can form crosslinked domains. As the self-assembly of GA gels happens within minutes fast recording is crucial to understand this process.3 When using these gels in wound healing applications, the gel strength is important for the gel to remain on the wound while glycerrhizin is released into the wound environment. Therefore, a study of the structure kinetics and structure evolution during the self-assembly process is essential to link with biological effects in wound healing processes. ","3821":"We shown that during cooling a significant part of the tetragonal zirconia crystals located into a dense zirconia polycrystals are transform to the monoclinic form in a very narrow temperature range.

They are classically made of fiberreinforced hydrogels with designed rheological behavior in order to give mechanical strength and structural support for the cell development. However, the mechanical properties of the extruded material which are influenced by the relationship between the hydrogel rheological behavior and the printing conditions remain unpredictable. Our team has developed a numerical approach to model the orientation of the matrix polymer chains and nanofibrils during extrusion-based 3D printing. To validate the model, the polymer and nanofibril flow-induced anisotropic orientation of the extruded material at the output of the nozzle are needed.","3823":"Precipitation is a family of phase transformations of major technological importance, notably in the metallurgy of structural alloys. While it is known that nucleus composition and interfacial energy play a critical role in the kinetics of the transformation, their evolution in multi-component systems is still poorly understood. It is proposed here to use a recently developed combinatorial methodology to measure the precipitation kinetics of M23C6 carbides in large ranges of the composition space. ","3824":"This proposal aims at determining the nature of lattice strain, compressive vs tensile, following the ultrafast photoexcitation of hot carriers in the canonical Mott insulator (V1-xCrx)2O3. Our recent \u00b5-XRD mapping on (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 thin films after an electric field-driven insulator to metal transition indeed revealed a compressive lattice response. As electric field and light pulses are both prone to generate hot carriers, we might expect that photoexcitation would also induce a compressive lattice response in (V1 - xCrx)2O3. Our preliminary pump-probe reflectivity study in (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 films is consistent with this view. Overall this study might challenge the paradigm by which photoexcitation of matter always leads to a thermally-driven expansion, and suggest that Mott physics can lead to a reverse compressive behavior. This study is part of the MOTT-IA project, which aims at creating the first hardware neural network based on the properties of Mott insulators. ","3825":"Thanks to their ability to switch reversibly between an amorphous and a crystalline state, Phase Change Materials (PCM; typically Ge-Sb-Te alloys) are attracting enormous attention for application in various types of memories (embedded, neuromorphic\u2026). Many studies aimed at investigating in situ the phase transition are reported in the literature but almost none at time scales comparable to those used in real devices (ns). In this experiment we plan to investigate the switching of a realistic PCM at ultimate time scales using a laser pump \u2013 X-ray probe experimental scheme.","3826":"We propose XPCS measurements (transmission geometry) of the atomic diffusion and gas coalescence of H\/He implantation in Si to gain insights into the kinetics of the first step of the SmartCutTM process. A study of the characteristic times\/activation energies of nanocavities as a function of implantation conditions (H\/He ratio and quantities) will be performed to understand these first evolution mechanisms that cannot be obtained by other techniques. Two types of samples will be measured: single implanted wafers and implanted wafer bonded on SiO2\/Si to understand the role of a stressor on the bubble and crack formation.","3827":"In this proposal we aim to understand the formation mechanism of 3D superlattices (3D-SLs) (up to 100 nm thick, i.e. 12 layers) of PbSe colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in the presence and during removal of the native oleic acid ligands. We plan to achieve this by using the combination of in-situ simultaneous GISAXS and GIWAXS at the liquid interface under controlled solvent evaporation conditions. Controlling the removal of insulation long alkyl chain ligands is key to tune the QD array\u2019s stoichiometry and structure in the range necessary to manipulate the density of states and charge transport, allowing to fabricate materials with high optoelectronic performances. By performing this in-situ experiment, we will determine the optimum conditions to achieve maximum order in the ligand-capped QD SLs and understand how to minimize the loss of structural order during ligand removal.","3828":"By investigating the L3 edge of Pd the objectives of this study are: (1) to uncover the interaction of CH4 and H2O with Pd species under reaction conditions, and (2) reveal the structural particularities of Pd sites leading to the fast inhibition and long-term H2O-deactivation behaviour for Pd\/Al2O3 methane oxidation catalyst.

In response, investigations are being done on other cations (Na+) and anions (F-, Cl-) as shuttling ions for battery systems. Recently, fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) are considered as an alternative for all-solid-state batteries based on intercalation-based cathode materials. This has not only led to higher cycling stability but also facilitates the lowering of overpotentials. In this respect, different second-generation intercalation materials have been studied, among which La2Ni0.75Co0.25O4 and La1.9Sr0.1Ni0.9Mn0.1Co0.1O4 have been identified for improved cycling performance. Further, X-ray absorption spectroscopy has proven successful to obtain element-specific information. As it also indicates structural changes which give information on the strain-induced locally,  the behavior of all transition metal cations in the pristine, charged and discharged state.","3831":"We propose to employ Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy to acquire microscopic maps of the lattice deformations in dislocation-free SiGe layers grown by lateral selective epitaxy on a Silicon-on-insulator substrate. These samples utilize an aspect-ratio dislocation trapping mechanism and are to serve as near-perfect SiGe virtual substrates, which are required for the housing of sensitive quantum devices such as spin qubits. The main goals are to map the spatially-dependent tensors of lattice strain and rotation as well as any gradients in the SiGe alloy composition. This data would provide insight into the mechanisms of lateral epitaxy and the associated anisotropic plastic relaxation, allowing better control of the complicated deposition procedure and the fabrication of larger dislocation-free regions. The results will help provide a path towards the up-scaling of quantum devices as well as the development of mechanical modells for the description of laterally grown thin films. ","3832":"This proposal aims at studying the antiferroelectric\/ferroelectric (AFE\/FE) transition in antiferroelectric PbZrO3 (PZO) thin films by scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) during the application of an electric field. SXDM provides access to the strain with a resolution of 10-5 and lattice tilt with millidegree accuracy while the spatial resolution is defined by the beam size [1-4]. The consecutive measurement at different voltages allows for imaging the strain evolution and the propagation of the FE phase close to the coercive field.","3833":"This proposal aims to investigate InAs\/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) capped with GaAsSb for high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Our objective is to study the influence of the Sb content (present in the capping layer), owing its key role to the energy band alignment, wavefunction topology and improved efficiency. Thus, this proposal envisages the use of scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) to obtain information about the structural lattice distortions present in QD-devices of different Sb contents. We also intend to record spatially resolved lattice features around the QD- areas by SXDM using an in-operando approach (bias voltage) at the ID01 beamline. Our findings will reveal the effect of high Sb content on the structure, gaining a deeper understanding of the efficiency improvement, and will help to optimize solar cells performance in the future.","3834":"Lack of testing standards for Nanoindentation fast mapping in the continuous stiffness measurement mode (depth sensing capability) of multiphase materials requires validation by nanodiffraction, to meet the challenges for establishing structure-property relationships. Data would be reusable in new experiments by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable fast -mapping by solely utilizing the nanomechanical profile of the material tested with similar composition. The proposal focuses on a complex material developed by PVD on a Si wafer. The thin film is consisted of Cu, Cr, Ti, W, where phases such as metallic glasses, alloys, and immiscible phases of elements are present, with a multi-granular structure. Elastic modulus and hardness mapping in the nanoscale (10-300 nm) will be studied to identify the deformation mechanics of the different metallic phases, combined by ex-situ nanodiffraction for validating phase distribution, and a SOP useable for industry will be documented.","3835":"The objective of this study is to obtain a microscopic mapping of the full tensors of strain and lattice orientation on three types of InGaN samples, which are competitive candidates to produce pseudo-substrates for InGaN red micro-LEDs. The first type of samples contains InGaN platelets on InGaN nanowirebased seeds. The main point here is to verify the similarity of one platelet to another in term of composition and lattice orientation. The second type of samples is an In-enriched InGaN layer on a porosified InGaN layer. The crucial point here is to determine if the porosification of the InGaN underlayer leads to inhomogeneity of the strain or the lattice orientation of the In-enriched InGaN upper layer. The third type of sample consists in an InGaN layer stretched on a polymer and transferred to a sapphire substrate. In this case, it is essential to check the strain and rotation fields due to eventual edge and screw threading dislocations after the stretching of the InGaN layer.","3836":"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received attention due to their high-power conversion efficiency close to silicon solar cells (25.7 vs 26.1%), low cost of preparation, and versatile properties. To obtain a highly efficient PCS, the perovskite layer needs to be thermally annealed to complete crystallization and minimization of the defects. The drawback of this process is the creation of strain (compressive or tensile) in the perovskite structure due to the mismatch between the expansion coefficient of the perovskite and substrate. The strain impacts several properties which are related to performance and stability. Here, we propose to evaluate the strain nature (compressive or tensile) in perovskite solar cells under operando conditions (temperature, light, and bias) by full-field diffraction X-ray microscopy. The operando experiment will be performed in a specially designed heating chip substrate and holder for accurate temperature control, illumination, and bias.","3837":"High voltage spinel cathode materials such as LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 are considered to be the next step in the evolution of lithium-ion battery technology due to their high energy density, fast charging capabilities, low material costs and the absence of Co. However, this material widespread use is hindered by its significant degradation problem in particular capacity fade due to Mn dissolution from the surface of the particle. Both operando and post mortem BCDI studies are very well suited to study this phenomenon since they will allow to gather structural information on the strain gradients inside the particles. We expect BCDI to give us insight into the interfacial reactions between Jahn-Teller distorted surface lattices and the electrolyte that is responsible for the capacity fade in LMNO. Moreover, the operando BCDI data on strain transformation inside a single particle would give us valuable information about the change of lithium ionic order and phase evolution at the nanoscale.","3838":"Homogenous alloy of 5 or more elements, commonly referred to as high entropy alloy nanocatalysts (HEAs), have recently demonstrated novel catalytic properties for a wide range of emerging electrocatalytic reactions. However, the absence of advance structural characterization efforts, especially those afforded by atomic-scale structural resolution, hinders our understanding about the true origin of HEAs\u2019 catalytic enhancement.  On the back of our group\u2019s recent breakthrough in resolving the atomic structure of HEAs, aided by PDF coupled with reverse Monte Carlo simulations, we are proposing a new set of experiments to study the dynamic structural changes in HEAs under electrochemical conditions. Using in-situ PDF analysis, we aim to uncover the spatiotemporal structural evolution of HEAs during methanol oxidation reaction, allowing us to build accurate structure-property relationships, which in turn will assist in the developing rational design strategies for HEAs. ","3839":"Understanding grain growth as a function of grain boundary energy through simulations informed by in-situ measurements is the motivation for this proposal. We will measure grain boundary velocity as a function of grain boundary character using scanning 3D X-ray diffraction (scanning 3DXRD) during in-situ sintering of undoped alumina. 3DXRD is necessary to spatially resolve the crystallographic orientations across the sample (to measure grain boundary character and positions as a function of time). Because the grains will be small (1\u221210 \u03bcm, slightly larger than is typically desirable for resolvability), we require scanning 3DXRD, which has a higher spatial resolution than conventional 3DXRD dictated by the beam cross-section (150\u2212200 nm^2). The results will be integrated into a computational methodology using a Cauchy-Crofton\/graph-based approach, and, more generally, develop a modern predictive understanding of grain growth that takes grain boundary energies into consideration.","3840":"Clean, sustainable, and predictable energy may be produced via nuclear fusion in the not-too-distant future. However, given that fusion reactors operate at elevated temperatures under complex cyclic loading regimes, the fatigue behaviour of the structural steel, EUROFER97, and its relationship with the development and evolution of intragranular stress tensor fields must be evaluated. This is essential for the qualification of in-vessel components and will shed significant light on the microstructural aspects of the mechanisms permitting fatigue failure. Considering the above, we propose to measure both the intergranular (type II) and intragranular (type III) three-dimensional stress tensor fields before and after the fatigue testing of EUROFER97 using scanning 3DXRD and the ID11 beamline.  ","3841":"As a result of recent developments at the ID11, Scanning Three Dimensional X-ray Diffraction Microscope (S3DXRD) methods for intragranular strain reconstruction has emerged. These methods have been used to reveal the 3D strain tensor field during in-situ loading of an ensemble of quartz grains. It was found that the 3D intragranular deformation fields featured strain localisation. At elevated loads, close to grain fracture, the study of these localisations requires not only a high spatial resolution in terms of narrow x-ray beam, but also, since the fracture transition itself is rapid, the increment between load steps must be small. To meet these requirements, we propose to perform S3DXRD measurements of a single grain during in-situ loading. By limiting the field of view to a single grain rather than an ensemble, we may decrease the beam size and increase the number of load steps for a given scan time. This will allow us to resolve the 3D deformation evolution leading up to fracture.","3843":"A 3D map of one grain within a polycrystalline shape memory (SMA) alloy will be performed with S-3DXRD during 8 stages of a superelastic loading. 5 steps during loading (3 of them in the transformation domain) and 3 steps during unloading.

We want to perform in situ time resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering (PDF analysis) in order to identify the reaction intermediates, including amorphous phases, that will form during the reactions. The reaction conditions identified in situ will then be used in our laboratory to isolate these intermediates, which will deliver new materials for electrocatalysis.

Here, we will use high energy x-ray scattering in transmission geometry to collect diffuse scattering volumes in-situ during AC electrical poling treatments and subsequent electric field cycling.

The state-of-the-art insights into the morphological evolution of metal NP populations on oxides during ALD cover the NP size and coverage (#NPs\/cm2), but currently lack information on the atomic 3D structures and surface structures of the NPs. Herein, GIPDF will be used to uncover the atomic structure of Pt NPs, from sub-nm clusters to crystalline facetted NPs, for different ALD chemistries. This approach will allow us to understand the structural response of the nuclei and NPs to the surface chemical reactions in ALD, which will be linked to information on the growth kinetics to elucidate how the NP structure and surface reactivity in ALD are intertwined.","3850":"All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with Li-metal anodes are a promising solution to enable safe, high-capacity Li-ion batteries. ASSBs have challenges that need to be resolved to enable their use, including cracking of the cathode and loss of contact between the cathode \/ solid-state electrolyte (SSE) due to volumetric expansion\/contraction during lithiation. X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) combined with x-ray absorption\/phase CT (XCT) can be used to inform a 3D understanding of the cathode\/SSE interface changes with cycling and the heterogeneity of these mechanisms. We propose to use these techniques on two SSEs: on LLZO, a popular high conductivity SSE, and on a new class of SSEs we have developed based on substituted forms of the popular Li6PS5Cl SSE. This study will provide important insight into the failure mechanisms of ASSBs and help guide future development of SSEs.","3851":"Next Gen batteries with improved energy densities are needed to electrify the automotive sector and meet ambitious Net Zero targets. These will use active materials such as silicon\/silicon oxide which are primarily amorphous or semi-crystalline during cycling, and extremely difficult to probe using traditional techniques such as X-ray diffraction.

We propose 4D (3 dimensions+ time) atomic mapping of working cells using pair-distribution-function computed tomography (PDF-CT), where total scattering data can be acquired with\r\nhigh spatial resolution, as a tool to understand these materials and their evolution during cycling. These investigations will reveal, and allow us to understand,important phase transitions and transformations in advanced chemistries and device architectures. This technique is a relatively new development and severely underexplored for energy storage applications","3853":"Lithium-Sulfur (LiS) batteries offer a five-fold increase in energy density compared to commercial lithium-ion cells, but low efficiency and poor long-term cyclability hinders the full potential of this technology. Recently, new electrolyte formulations have been proposed to transition to a \u2018solid-solid\u2019 conversion pathway, avoiding the detrimental polysulfide dissolution, and seeing a significant increase in performance. This experiment aims to realise the first combined operando X-ray tomographic microscopy and X-ray diffraction experiment to track the microstructure evolution along the \u2018solid-solid\u2019 conversion pathway and identify the formation of phases during cell operation. From the results, we will elucidate the nature of the 'solid-solid' conversion of S8 to Li2S and correlate the morphological and phase changes with electrochemical data, providing insights into the rational design of electrodes and electrolytes for high-performance cells.","3854":"The design of highly performing anodes for Sodium Ion Batteries is a mandatory step for the commercialization of these devices. Here the study of new compositions of High Entropy Nasicon (NA Super Ionic CONductors) with formula NaMNb(PO4)3 with M = Al, Zn, Fe, Mn, Cr Ti, V, W is proposed by means of synchrotron XRD techniques able to provide high intensity \u2013 high resolution data. The compositions have been designed with the purpose of obtaining large channels for Na diffusion and suitable band structure. The materials will be investigated under working conditions of the cell vs Na. This will allow for the i) phase evolution, ii) location of the Na sites, iii) characterization of the electrode reactions. Globally, the proposed experiment will help us to gain insight into the correlation of the structural aspects - functional properties on the present materials and possibly to the identification of guidelines to review our work and design new compositions with improved properties.","3855":"In this project the adsorption capacity for CO2 and the selectivity of zeolites with CHA topology will be evaluated in relation to the framework flexibility and to the molecules-cations interactions. Different CHA type zeolites containing various counter balancing cations (Cs, Na, K) will be tested for CO2 adsorption in the presence of competing molecule (i.e. N2, H2O) at different temperatures. Mixed CO2 + N2 systems will be tested to mimic the CHA behavior as phisysorbent in direct air capture (DAC). The project aims to unveil the relation among CO2 adsorption and structural flexibility by highlighting the role of the host-guests interactions at atomistic level.","3856":"The level of the local strains due to thermal loading in pure zirconia or aluminum titanate bulk materials is of few percent. Such very high values of elastic strains are due to phase transitions or anisotropy of the thermal expansion and they have a great influence on the thermomechanical properties of these materials. The determination of the stresses values associated to these strains require the knowledge of thermal expansion of stress-free crystals of the same phases. This is the aim of this proposal to determine these fundamental characteristics.","3857":"Titanium alloys use at high temperature is limited by the oxide scale growth and by the O dissolution in the alloy. Nitrogen contained in the atmosphere may play an important role on the oxidation resistance, as it reduces the kinetics by accumulating at metal\/oxide interface. The mechanisms leading to positive impact of nitrogen are still not yet understood, as N-rich phases that may form crystallize with the same crystallographic structure and have very close lattice parameters to O-rich phases. High (hkl) diffraction peaks are needed in order to differentiate between these phases, but they are not accesible with laboratory X-ray wavelenghts.The aim of the in-situ synchrotron experiment is to investigate N-rich phases forming in ambient air at high temperature. Their growth will be followed during the first exposure stages and the time when they form will be identified with respect to O-phases. The impact of alloying elements will be studied by using different composition Ti alloys.","3858":"Projection of self-fluxing NiCrBSi alloys generates a complex microstructure composed by various low-symmetrical borides, carbides and silicides. Due to a\r\nweak signal to noise ratio, conventional XRD analysis is not sufficient to obtain reliable crystallographic data.\r\nIn situ synchrotron XRD solidification experiments data are available for ternary nickel - chromium - silicon alloys and have provided useful information concerning the solidification sequence. However, similar studies are lacking for NiCrBSi alloys.\r\nLast, attempts to produce bulks by Selective Laser Melting revealed more complex and strongly refined microstructure poorly described by the literature, were phase identification by synchrotron XRD would be helpful.\r\nThe two objectives of this study are:\r\n- Identify complex phases of NiCrBSi alloys obtained by both casting and Selective Laser Melting.\r\n- Determine equilibrium phases transformation sequence of NiCrBSi alloys by in situ XRD solidification experiment.","3859":"Cyclic heating and rapid melting\/solidification mechanism cause complex thermal gradients during direct metal deposition (DMD) of Inconel 718 changing dynamically in time and region within the bulk material. These changes can trigger repetitive phase transformations and evolutions along the build height of the part inducing microscopic and macroscopic strains. In order to decouple and disclose contributions (microstructural, thermal, residual stresses) of the overall stress state, phase and lattice parameter evolution needs to be monitored during printing. The commonly used techniques for characterization are not adequate for resolving phase development due to the lack of time and spatial resolution. Hence, a time-resolved in-situ DMD of wire Inconel 718 via synchrotron x-ray diffraction at ID31 is hereby proposed. This study will disclose the solidification sequence at regions of interests (including melt pool) and its phase and lattice parameter evolution during continuous printing.","3860":"The structural evolution of an Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalyst will be investigated during activation, reaction and the co-feeding of CO2 using combined operando PDF-CT and XRD-CT. A new experimental setup with the capability of achieving the reaction conditions used in commercial high-temperature FT processes (350 \u00b0C and 20 bar) will be utilised. The combination of high temperature and pressures of toxic, flammable gases, the undoubted mechanistic complexity, and a product slate comprising both gases and liquids makes this an ambitious but potentially rewarding study. The proposed multi-technique approach will permit us to evaluate correlations between catalyst performance and spatially resolve variations in oxidation states, local and atomic structure, composition, and species distribution. These structure-performance relationships will expedite the further development of processes that utilise sources of waste CO2 to produce synthetic crude.","3862":"We recently found that the coercivity and anisotropy of SmCo5 can be reversibly controlled with huge amplitudes by applying voltages of only 1 V. This is implemented by the voltage-driven insertion and extraction of hydrogen atoms in interstitial sites. This breaks the limitations imposed by short electric-field screening and thus opens an avenue for practical applications such as voltage-assisted magnetic recording. However, the mechanism behind the huge change of magnetic properties remains unresolved, for instance how hydrogen atoms interact with neighboring atoms and how magnetic moments change.Here, it is proposed to monitor the dynamic change of magnetic moments of Co and Sm atoms during the in situ hydrogen charging\/discharging. It would reveal the change of local magnetic and electronic structures at elemental basis.  ","3863":"The aim of this proposal is to have a complete description of the magnetic and electronic properties of  1,2,5-benzothiadole\/CuCl2 ((btd)\/CuCl2) and 1,2,5-benzoselenadizole\/CuCl2 ((bSed)\/CuCl2) single crystals organic\/inorganic hybrid coordination polymers, using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy. These are molecule-based magnetic compounds exhibiting the coexistence of different magnetic orders. The goal is to establish the relationship between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) orders in these compounds probably related to the presence of helimagnet spin order as observed in full-inorganic anhydrous cupric halides parent compounds when the organic part is changed. To verify this picture, we propose to measure magnetic circular and linear dichroism at the Cu L2,3 edges on hybrid single crystals.","3864":"The present study is focused on the determination of the local site of Yb 3+ ions in silica-based transparent glass ceramics and to its correlation with the observed luminescence properties.","3865":"The study of the prevailing factors impacting the dissolution kinetics of UO2-based compounds is of primary importance to forecast the behavior of the SNF during its reprocessing. Using Nd as surrogate for minor actinides and fission products, our goal is to study the impact of the U speciation and O vacancy formation on the dissolution kinetics and mechanisms of U1-yNdyO2-x solid solutions. Our first results revealed a much lower chemical durability of U1-yNdyO2-x samples compared to UO2. A 100-fold increase in dissolution rate was found between samples prepared at 700 and 1200\u00b0C suggesting important differences in U valence states and O vacancies concentrations. In this aim, HEFRD-XANES measurements will provide us crucial information on the U speciation in the prepared solids (various temperatures and operating atmospheres), especially in terms of U(IV)\/U(V) ratio. In the meantime, the analysis of U and Nd environments by EXAFS will allow us to confirm the presence of O vacancies.","3866":"This project is aimed at the study of the physical and structural properties of two newly discovered semiconducting phases of tin monoselenide, pi-SnSe and gamma-SnSe. Both differ in properties compared to the conventional phase \u03b1-SnSe, and the latter shows an ultra-small bandgap and subsequently, very high electrical conductivity. The ultimate goals of the proposal are (i) to employ XAS techniques for investigation of the local symmetry of the constituting elements, Sn and Se, in the pi-SnSe and gamma-SnSe phases with respect to alpha-SnSe. (ii) to use temperature resolved measurements for monitoring the evolution of phase transitions of these new phases. (iii) to elucidate the role of small amounts of Pb2+ cations in stabilizing \u03c0-SnSe. The results are expected to shed light also on the unique optical and electronic properties of these two new phases of tin monoselenide. ","3867":"High-entropy oxides (HEOs) constitute a new paradigm in materials design, with a large variety of compositions and structures provided by the entropy mediated phase stabilization concept. This class of compounds offer new opportunities to achieve tunable properties that are often unique because they are driven by synergetic effects between the combined elements. For instance, recent studies have emphasized prospective applications in the field of electrochemical energy storage and catalysis.\r\n In this proposal, we intend to monitor the formation and the demixion of the canonical (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O entropy-stabilized oxide from combined and quantitative XAFS\/XRD studies as a function of temperature.","3869":"Operation stability of cathode active materials (CAMs) for Li-ion batteries at elevated temperatures is a major bottleneck to overcome for their broad market penetration. Ageing mechanisms, such as the dissolution of transition metals (TMs) and their subsequent deposition on the anode have been shown to significantly accelerate with increasing temperature, resulting in cell ageing and eventually failure. Within this proposal, we aim for a comparative evaluation of the impact of temperature, upper cut-off potential and TM composition on the dissolution of TMs from conventional (NCM111) and Ni-rich (NCM811 and NCA) CAMs. The dissolved TMs are quantified under operando conditions by probing XANES at Mn, Co, and Ni-K-edges within the electrolyte, as well as on the counter electrode, using a special cell setup which enables both heating and the spatial resolution of TMs within the cell volume.","3871":"This proposal aims at initiating a new synthesis method to deliver novel nanomaterials, by performing chemical reactions in molten salts as liquid reaction media at elevated pressures (2-6 GPa) and high temperatures (600-1100 C). We want to monitor reaction pathways as a function of pressure and temperature, by performing in situ X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) to identify reaction intermediates and products. We want to understand structural transformations during liquid-phase syntheses and identify promising compounds in order to design new electrocatalysts for H2 production from water. High pressures have never been coupled to molten salts for materials synthesis, despite the unique compounds accessible only at high pressures. We will focus on the Fe\/Ni-Si-B system for which the state-of-the-art reports a rich high-pressure structural diversity. Addressing this new synthesis method will require extending the use of recently developed resistive heated diamond anvil cells (RH DAC).","3872":"Boron carbide is a popular superhard ceramic, with application ranging from abrasives to nuclear power plants. However, it famously, and anomalously, loses its high mechanical strength at impacts beyond 15-17 GPa. Several hypotheses such as amorphisation and point vacancy generation has been proposed to explain this phenomenon.  Recently, a carbon rich boron carbide containing C-C chains has been designed from first principles which will not have the fatal structural flaws of conventional B4C, thus preventing the dynamic failure. In fact, we have observed evidence of the synthesis of this material ex-situ at 62 GPa in a laser heated diamond anvil cell. However, we need XRD and Raman characterisation before and after compression, laser heating and decompression using the small beamspot and high intensity of the ESRF synchrotron to analyse this high pressure phase transformation of boron carbide completely.","3873":"The aim of this proposal is to track pore evolution during thermo-mechanical tests representative of hot rolling using ex situ multi-resolution micro-CT of plain compression tests of large (40x60x80mm) aluminum 2050 samples at BM05. This study is critical to link the macroscopic pore evolution, previously studied in small specimens, with the industrial hot rolling process [1,2]. Using the ability to image both the full specimen (40x60x80mm) at low-resolution (20\u00b5m\/pixel) and some region of interests at high-resolution (2\u00b5m\/pixel), we can track pore closure or nucleation and growth (shape, size, volume, pore density) in selected volumes of interest as a function of the strain field (triaxiality and Lode parameter). Interrupted in situ plain strain condition tests will be conducted to reproduce different hot rolling schemes (temperature, thickness reduction, strain rate) and help us refine and extend the previously proposed pore evolution laws for all the mechanical conditions.","3874":"This experiment aims to utilise the new scout and zoom capabilities offered on BM18 to conduct tomography experiments on full-scale additively manufactured (AM) components. In particular, we aim to map the defect distribution in turbine blade components manufactured using laser powder bed fusion from Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 alloys to understand the efficacy of manufacturing process control algorithms in controlling defect structures in real components. Until now we have had to study defects introduced by AM on sub-scale test-pieces rather than industrial-scale components.  This will enable us to refine and validate control algorithms in manufacturing \u201con demand\u201d full scale components and thereby to engineer the defect distribution to facilitate the uptake of AM for safety critical parts in industry.","3875":"The project aims to characterise the thermal deformation modes in a clayey rock at the microstructure scale. The rock is multiphase with a heterogeneous solid phase and a complex fluid phase (free water, absorbed water). Solid phase is composed of mineral inclusions (size of a few tens of microns) embedded in a porous clay matrix. Due to the contrast in thermal expansion of the different phases and heterogeneities, heating will induce thermal overpressurisation of the fluid in undrained conditions. The damage modes at the microstructure scale (inclusions) are poorly understood. The aim of the study will be to quantify the deformation mechanisms using microtomography imaging (sub-micron resolution) combined with image correlation. Studied specimens come the Cigeo nuclear waste disposal site.","3876":"Atmospheric reentry is one of the most severe conditions for materials. During this short period (5-15min), several reactions take place at the surface of thermal protection systems. The high surface temperature (above 2500\u00b0C), high speed and oxygen presence lead to ablation and oxidation phenomena. Understanding all the phenomena which take place during the atmospheric reentry is very difficult. One of the best ways to study it is in situ micro-tomography. For these experiments,  synchrotron radiations are mandatory for fast and high-resolution tomography\u2019s reasons. ","3877":"Recycled concrete aggregates carbonation is one of the key solutions to trap CO2 emitted during concrete production back into the material, aiming to approach carbon-neutrality. However, it is a complex process, that depends on several factors, such as the carbon dioxide transport within the material, the moisture content in the pore network and other environmental conditions. These effects are still poorly understood since all current theories rely on point-wise, macroscopic measures, neglecting the intrinsically heterogeneous nature of the process. We seek instead to quantify, in-situ, the spatial distribution of the absorbed carbon by tracking the progressive concrete density variation along with occupancy of the pore-space over a range of conditions to understand the micro-scale processes underlying the macroscopic response. The high contrast and fast X-ray microtomography available at the ID19 of ESRF is the perfect tool to quantify these processes in situ.","3878":"The suggested experiments aims to understand the cracking mechanisms occurring in stainless steel due to cavitation erosion using X-ray tomography in the framework of hydroelectric energy. Cavitation erosion is the one of the main damaging mode occurring on hydroelectric turbines. Understanding the cracking mechanisms, using ERSF beamline, is hence a strategic concern within the scope of energetic transition. The objective of the proposed experiment is to explore the unknown relation between microstructural parameters and damages mechanisms during cavitation erosion with a strong focus on kinetic phenomena. In this project, we will take advantage of the unique combination of high energy, coherency, spatial resolution and flux available at ID19 for revealing complex phenomena: 3d-microstructure and bulk stress field. The initiation and propagation of cracks within the different phases will be monitored in-situ using a unique homemade apparatus.","3879":"Space wastes represent an increasingly threatening risk for mobile structures and aerospace traffic (e.g., space modules or spacecraft), leading to potential high velocity impacts that can cause devastating damage. On the other hand, there are increasing demands to reduce the on-board weight in order to reach more effective launching by lowering the fuel consumption. Porous ceramics present a good candidate for light protective solutions thanks to the ability to dissipate impact energy through fragmentation and to tailor their microstructural porosity within a given need. Therefore, the mechanical behavior of porous ceramics under dynamic loadings needs to be assessed in order to gain better understanding of the local damage and fracture\r\nmechanisms under high strain rate loadings. The aim of this proposal is thus to identify the fracture mechanisms in porous ceramics and how they are modified by the microstructure type (size and morphology of porosities) and the strain-rate.","3880":"To achieve unprecedented time sequencing of fibre break accumulation in Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs) this experiment will use in situ dark field radiographic imaging in conjunction with post-mortem high resolution Computed Tomography (CT) to obtain uniquely fast, data-rich quantification of tensile failure. Fibre-break imaging to date has been too slow to reveal the chronology of breaks, particularly the formation of clusters thought to control final failure. Dark field imaging is an opportunity to obtain sufficient contrast from 2D radiography to detect damage, with ID19 offering the potential for break detection in the ms regime. We will use an established coupon geometry and test device, with two aerospace-grade laminates. Combining high-resolution free-space-propagation and lower-resolution dark-field imaging will enable observation of single fibre cracking dynamics as well as cluster evolution and damage accumulation in the entire stress area of the test specimens.","3883":"The octopus have eight arms, baring each a large number of suckers, with theoretically infinite degrees of freedom and control them through a rather complex nervous system distributed between the central and the elaborated peripheral nervous system of the arm. Octopuses are very tactile animals and rely mostly on what is described as a contact-based chemo sensation [4] of their suckers. Like the octopus, today\u2019s soft robots have a large number of degrees of freedom.  A contact-based interaction is similarly used in soft-robotics to reduce the complexity of controlling a large number of degrees of freedom but challenges for robotics include the mechanics and sensing required to build such systems. Here we propose to investigate 1) the presence, structure and innervation pathway of the muscle proprioception in the octopus arm; 2) the structure and organization of mechano and chemical receptors of the octopus arm sucker.","3884":"We would like to perform X-ray nano-Hollography Tomography to characterize the microstructure of the oxide precursors used to synthesize Li-rich layered oxide positive electrode materials. The oxides show secondary particles being about 10 \u00b5m in average with primary particles smaller than 40 nm (spatial resolution) for primary particles. The lithiated layered oxides are also characterized by secondary particles being about 10 \u00b5m in diameter, with primary particles up to 200 nm in diameter. The goal is to visualize the overall porosity of the spherical aggregates. They will be put in a resin that will be cut with a laser to get cylinders of approximately 100 \u00b5m high and 30-40 \u00b5m in diameter. Those will be put on a carbon pin. This preparation will allow to have enough particles cut to make a statistical analysis of the different oxide samples. ","3885":"Transparent polyurethane aerogels were synthesized for the very first time in our previous publications. These materials present the lowest thermal conductivity ever measured for this aerogel matrix, according to the literature. To understand and further improve this value it is essential to theoretically model their thermal conductivity. Their porous structure, composed by a pearl-necklace structure with 30 nm-particles and presenting a bimodal porosity (pores below 100 nm) is the main responsible for their great insulating capacity, therefore, providing an accurate model relies on characterizing this inner structure. Thus, the use of the ESRF facilities (synchrotron radiation-based phase-contrast hard X-ray nanoholotomography under cryogenic conditions) would be really useful for this investigation. It will allow to determine for the first time the porous structure of transparent PU aerogels, information of critical importance for the state of the art and predicting their properties.","3887":"The improvement of formability under plane strain tension of 6XXX series Al-alloys would result in the reduction of automotive CO2 emissions. The present proposal aims at understanding strain localization and damage nucleation under plane strain tension using correlative techniques. A lab DCT scan will reveal the grain structure in 3D prior to in situ nano-tomography tensile testing. During the nanotomography scanning, very small particles can be seen that allow for image correlation at high resolution inside the material and to identify strain heterogeneity up to fracture in link with the underlying grain structure. Damage nucleation and growth kinetics will be identified at very small length scales. The measured strain fields will be compared to numerical twin 3D crystal plasticity simulations.","3888":"There is great potential for developing carbon-reactive cement using the massive magnesium resources, but we understand little about their hydration and carbonation kinetics to control their macro-level properties. The main objective of this project is to create high-resolution 3D models of early-stage microstructure development (including the sequence of MgO dissolution, precipitation, and nucleation, as well as the changes in pore structures) of MgO-hydromagnesite blend. We will perform a correlative study complementing the NanoCT data with rheology, XRD, and NMR characterization resulting in a descriptive model for the reaction kinetics.","3889":"The mechanical properties of fibre-reinforced polymer composites are governed by the properties of the fibre, matrix, and interface. Many single-fibre testing strategies have been developed to investigate these constituents. Unfortunately, such model composites are not representative for real composites. We, therefore, suggest an alternative route through digital volume correlation (DVC) and synchrotron radiation computed tomography. This allows quantitative strain mapping in real macrostructures while unravelling the in-situ development of microscale damage. Having already validated the representativity of our model composites (at ID19 and TOMCAT), the main challenge currently lies in differentiating matrix and fibre response, which is essential for the validation of our developed numerical models. We will exploit the 150-200 nm voxel sizes possible at ID16B together with acquisition times of 30 minutes to resolve this crucial bottleneck.","3891":"This proposal concerns halide perovskites used as upper active layer on top of silicon for tandem solar cells. Our aim is to simultaneously map, using the ID13 nano-beam, the microstructural properties of perovskite layers, as well as the halide composition by combining XRD and XRF. The objective is to gain fundamental insights into the processes governing the microstructure of pristine and aged perovskite layers, which is of the outmost importance for further improvement of the performances of tandem cells. State-of-the-art perovskite layers deposited on flat silicon and silicon with pyramid-textured surfaces, will be studied. The influence of the deposition technique on the microstructure of pristine layers will be investigated (slot die coating vs. physical vapor deposition), as well as the effect of aging by probing slot die deposited layers exposed to controlled illumination. Finally, cross-section samples obtained by cryo-FIB will be used to probe along the layer\u2019s depth. ","3892":"For predating and defence, scorpions largely rely on their sharp stingers to inject venom, subjecting these stingers to extreme mechanical loads. In contrast to other arthropods, e.g. crustaceans, who employ mineral for cuticle hardening, spiders and scorpions (class Arachnida) fabricate hard and sharp parts entirely without mineral. Alternatively, they often use locally elevated levels of metal ions such as Zn and Mn, as they are also found in scorpion stingers. A recent experiment at BM05, however, showed strong variations of metal ion type and distribution, both between species and in different locations of the stinger, suggesting substantial variation of strategies or even metal ion functionalites different from just mechanics. By high resolution XRD and XRF mapping, we wish to get insight into the structure, composition and functionality of scorpion stingers, a fascinating, but not fully explored type of biological tissue.   \r\n","3893":"Existing models still fail in correctly describing the relationship between the strain induced crystallinity (SIC) occurring in elastomer such as Natural or Synthetic Poly-Isoprene (PI) Rubber and their mechanical response. Preliminary experiments carried out at the D2AM beamline (proposal A021-900, main proposer G. Coativy, report 20201186) showed the determining role of the loading history on SIC since it enables to obtain, for a same crystallinity and stretching level, a very different mechanical response. This is likely related to the different stretching states of the amorphous chains which connect the crystallites, at the time these ones are nucleated and grow. Our objective is therefore to perform original in situ SAXS\/WAXS experiments using PI elastomers, crosslinked so that their chains between crosslinks have initially different lengths and stretching levels ; these materials will be submitted to different loading paths combining relaxation and fast stretching steps.  ","3894":"Aircraft transmission systems carters are usually made with precipitation-strengthened aluminium alloys. These pieces are subjected to long-term (>1000h) in-service ageing at temperatures between 150-200\u00b0C, close to the initial precipitation ageing temperatures. The effect of this ageing on the nano-precipitates is both challenging to explore (given the duration and potential temperature range) and to model since multiple mechanisms are at play. The aim of this proposal which is part of the PhD project of Thomas Perrin (with SAFRAN Transmission Systems) is to use space-resolved SAXS-WAXS on multiple samples aged for long durations (up to 5000h) in a gradient furnace, so that we can acquire all kinetics at all temperatures. This would represent an unprecedented corpus of data which would enable to distinguish between the possible mechanisms (in particular, the potential phase transitions that would be detected by WAXS) and which would serve as a training set for the alloy design model.","3895":"This proposal aims at determining the nature of lattice strain, compressive vs tensile, following the ultrafast photoexcitation of hot carriers in Mott insulator (V1-xCrx)2O3. Our \u03bc-XRD mapping on (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 thin films after an electric field-driven insulator to metal transition indeed revealed a compressive lattice response. As electric field and light pulses are both prone to generate hot carriers, we might expect that photoexcitation would also induce a compressive lattice response in (V1-xCrx)2O3. However our recent time-resolved XRD study of (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 films at ID09 revealed a tensile rather than compressive effect. To clarify the situation, we propose to work in parts of the temperature-x phase diagram more prone to reveal this sought photoinduced compressive effect. Overall this study might challenge the paradigm by which photoexcitation of matter always leads to a thermally-driven expansion, and suggest that Mott physics can lead to a reverse compressive behavior. ","3896":"Battery electrolytes provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the relationship between polymer dynamics and ion transport, with polymer electrolytes providing a safer alternative to commercially used liquid electrolytes. Here, we propose heterodyne XPCS measurements to directly probe local dynamics and polymer velocities spatially across concentration gradients, considering the nuances of salt concentration on transport and directly determining cation transport. A deeper understanding of ion transport in polymeric materials for energy storage applications will enable the design of new electrolyte and electrode materials, the simulation of device performance and safety and the accurate prediction of electrolyte responses in any electrochemical cell configuration overall operating conditions.","3898":"Two-dimensional (2D) materials are one- or few- atom thick crystals with high thermal and mechanical stability and physical properties governed by extreme quantum confinement. With its unique crystalline structure, graphene exhibits a plethora of unconventional electronic phenomena, whose exploration was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. Graphene is part of a larger family of 2D materials: one of its cousins, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), shares the same crystal lattice but exhibits different properties.  The state-of-the-art method for its synthesis is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on solid substrates, yet it is still difficult to control its thickness and structural quality over large scales. To enhance its quality, here we are aiming to CVD grow h-BN crystals on the surface of a liquid substrate (molten copper) while characterizing its structure using in situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GID) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR.)\r\n","3899":"While performances in organic solar cells (OSCs) have soared in the last five years, the lack of stability is hindering the commercialization of flexible, wearables devices. Among the different sources of instability, the diffusion of small molecules out of the mixed domains has been identified as a very important and inherent issue that must be tackled. However, there is still a lack understanding about the structural interaction between rigid conjugated polymers and non-fullerene acceptor molecules, that are nowadays the keystone system for high efficiency OSCs. We have proved in recent experiments how the same system yield different mixing behavior with different thermal stability upon the experimental parameters during fabrication. We aim to study the synergies and structural interactions between a series of conjugated polymers and small molecules, approaching a correlation between the blend and their thermal stability, that will be critical for their performance stability.\r\n","3900":"The Warm Dense Matter (WDM) state is an \u201cexotic\u201d state of matter which shows densities typical of solids and temperatures typical of plasmas. A theoretical description of WDM is far from being achieved since conventional approximations that apply to solids or plasmas fail for such complex state and experimental data are scarce. WDM states are encountered in the inner cores of giant planets and also in the compression stage towards the inertial confinement fusion. First Light Fusion is a company leader in inertial confinement fusion research and they are interested in characterizing the properties of high-Z metals up to dynamic multi-Mbar conditions, as these metals are used for the implosion capsules or for the impactor. We propose here to use ns time resolved X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize the properties of WDM Copper subjected to high-power laser shock and release by means of High Power Laser Facility. The results will be compared to ab initio MD simulations.","3901":"The ability to electrooxidize biomass compounds efficiently and selectively can serve as source of both renewable hydrocarbons and H2 under electrolysis conditions.  Although a host of common anode electrocatalysts have been implemented in biomass oxidation reactions, our group has recently discovered that Cu-based materials, notoriously bad catalyst for water electrooxidation, exhibit enhanced reactivity and selectivity toward biomass.  With this beamtime proposal, we aim to resolve the Cu active site structure in layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalysts using in-situ XAS, providing insights into the design of future catalyst with improved biomass electrolysis properties.","3902":"The proposed combined operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) & Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments will focus on elucidating the influence of Bi as a promotor element on the structure and electronic properties of a Pt\/Al2O3 Diesel Oxidation Catalyst for the CO oxidation reaction. It has been well established that Pt catalysts suffer from CO poisoning at low temperatures. Our previous results show that he addition of Bi prevents CO poisoning and lowers T50%, the temperature at which 50% of CO is converted to CO2. However, the way in which Bi promotes the catalysts is not yet well understood. The proposed operando XAS\/DRIFTS characterization study will allow us to observe the evolution of the Pt active site with XAS, while simultaneously probing the electronic properties with CO as a molecular probe with DRIFTS, during CO oxidation reaction monitored by online MS. These transient data will shed light on the effect of Bi on the (electronic) structure of the Pt\/Al2O3 catalyst.","3903":"This proposal aims to study the effect on water vapor during the CO oxidation reaction over Pt particles dispersed on CaTi1-xFexO3-\u03b4 support, with x=0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. This novel support material shows catalytic activities similar to ceria, converting CO already at room temperature. Interestingly we observe, that the CO conversion is favoured in presence of water vapor in the gas feed (CO+O2+H2O, \u201cwet conditions\u201d). We believe that this significant enhance in catalytic performance, is due to the formations of extremely water derived active species (e.g hydroxyl and\/or carboxyl) on top of the Pt nanoparticles and to strong metal-support interaction (creation of Pt-Fe bonds). Using operando photon-in\/photon-out spectroscopy we will study the electronic structure and local coordination of Ti, Fe and Pt. ","3904":"In the field of photocatalysis, balanced co-doping of TiO2 with transition metal cations and nitrogen emerged as a promising approach to modify the optoelectronic properties of TiO2 in order to reduce its bandgap while limiting the density of defects. Our work on (Nb,N) codoped materials confirmed the improved photocatalytic activity depending on the synthesis conditions. The presence of Nb5+ in substitution of Ti4+ in the anatase TiO2 lattice was confirmed by XPS and XRD. But for the N doping atoms, while they seem to play a key role in the structure\/efficiency relationship, the nature of doping sites remains largely unknown. This is due to the lack of characterization methods allowing to distinguish N from O in this type of structure. Valence to Core (VTC) X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (XES) at Nb and Ti K edge could then be a useful method to probe the coordination sphere of these cations and identify the presence of nitrogen in their environment.","3906":"This LTP is motivated by systematic studies on ammonia synthesis catalysts under the realistic conditions of the Haber-Bosch process, as employed for the production of sustainable renewable ammonia at offshore wind power plants. Over the course of  6 beamtime scheduling periods, electronic and geometric structure of active metals (Fe, Ru) as well as of electronic (K, Cs, Ca, Ba) and structural (Al, Si) promoters will be thoroughly studied at the ID26 beamline under stationary and transient conditions. In the course of the LTP a pixel detector will be installed in the TEXS which, together with sets of high quality Johansson crystals, which will enable X-ray Fluorescence Intensity Ratio Detection (XFIRD). Furthermore, a high pressure operando catalysis cell will be developed. The planned investments will enable spatially- and time-resolved operando tender X-ray HERFD-XANES and XES spectroscopy on working catalysts for chemical energy storage and related processes. ","3907":"We propose to investigate the role of heating at the nanoscale (both in time and in space) as one of the microscopic mechanisms possibly responsible for\r\nradiation damage. We want to measure the single-crystal XRD patterns and the corresponding lattice thermal expansion as a function of the photon flux density,\r\nfilling mode and sample temperature. These measurements will be compared to numerical predictions and will provide valuable information for defect engineering\r\nand X-ray nanopatterning (XNP).","3908":"Dielectric breakdown is the process by which an insulating material becomes conductive when subjected to high enough voltages, and electric current flows through it. This process limits the energy storage capacity of capacitors, and is destructive. In this proposed experiment, we will use Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) to perform pre- and post-mortem quantification of the strain-fields around breakdown patterns in ferroelectric single crystals. This will provide insight into the breakdown mechanism, and thereby guide the  design of more robust capacitors with higher breakdown strength. It will also establish feasibility for future time-resolved experiments, where we aim to capture time-resolved movies of dielectric breakdown.","3909":"This proposal aims to make the first ever direct measurements of how deeply-embedded defects impede the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition in lead free antiferroelectric materials. These materials are widely seen as promising candidates for the next generation of environmentally sustainable energy storage capacitors and, as such, this work is expected to provide fundamental insight into the phenomena and processes that limit their performance. The experiment will involve using the FFDXM capabilities of ID01 to make 3D maps of the defect-domain wall interfaces that facilitate the charge storage, during the in-situ application of large electric fields. This work comprises an essential aspect of the PhD project of the Principle Investigator.","3910":"Electron spin qubits in Si1-xGex\/Si\/Si1-xGex heterostructures are based on quantum dots (QDs) defined by the strain of the Si quantum well (QW) plus electrostatic gates. Spin coherent shuttling over several microns is possible by applying time-dependent waveforms to the gates. Strain fluctuations on the 100 nm level deteriorate the uniformity of electron potential and may lead to decoherence. As shown by non-destructive nano-beam XRD measurements, a significant source of strain is the stress exerted by the gate electrodes themselves. Here, we propose to use coherent Bragg diffraction to further enhance the resolution and thus be able to investigate real shuttling devices (\u201cQuBus\u201d) with structure sizes smaller than the nano-beam. This will involve focused ion beam (FIB) preparation to provide samples of optimal size for coherent diffraction.","3911":"An original method, known as Nano-Pendeo Epitaxy, has been developed for achieving low threading dislocation density (TDD) gallium nitride (GaN). It is based on the self-realignment of GaN on Si(111) nano-pillars. This study has two goals. Firstly, to understand the coalescence mechanisms. Secondly, to construct a model to predict optimal structures for low TDD layers. Measurements performed on the ID01 beamline proved that it is possible to measure the change in lattice tilt of the GaN and silicon (Si) layers before and after coalescence which proved that the growth occurs as expected. Simpler samples are needed to better understand the growth process. Using an alternative sample,  insight into pillar coalescence in lines was gained through dark field X-ray microscopy measurements on ID06, but the low intensity of thin Si layers prevented examination of Si behavior. Therefore, we aim to measure the tilt and strain distribution in the Si pillars and GaN layers within optimized samples.","3912":"In this work, we will explore nano-porous single crystals of Mn[Co(CN)6]2\/3 Prussian Blue Analogue (Mn[Co] PBA) with three distinct pore networks as molecular sieves for separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr). The pores in PBAs are defined by the vacancies of Co(CN)6 units and have the size of one to two kinetic diameters of Kr and Xe, almost optimal for separation purpose. Our aim is twofold. First we will study the efficiency of Xe and Kr separation as a function of local structure of the Mn[Co] PBA. Second, we will use a novel method to study the absorption site of Kr and Xe and the induced relaxation of the host lattice by observing the change in single crystal diffuse scattering of the material.","3914":"By surface x-ray diffraction we aim to solve the 3D structure of the 8x8 beta-Si3N4(0001) reconstruction on Si(111). This system draws attention because of its potential as sub-nanometer thin insulator layer for  metal\/silicon junctions. In the literature, although several chemical and the electronic properties have been investigated, there is no consensus on the atomic structure of this interface. The high computational requirements still prevent the simulation of whole structure because of the large number of atoms participating in the 8x8 supercell. The precise identification of the atomic positions constituting the interface can be relevant for the understanding of the electronic band structure, a first step towards the exploitation of this interface in future electronic devices.   ","3915":"This proposal involves 3D Laue microdiffraction experiments within single crystalline cross-sections of twisted Au micro wires with a bamboo microstructure using the DAXM setup at BM32. The DAXM measurements can be used to determine both, the global and local deformation (strain and misorientation fields) in 3D as well as the corresponding density of GNDs as function of the radial position within the single crystalline cross-section of the wire. By comparing wires with different diameters for different degrees of deformation (shear strain at the surface is equal for every wire diameter), it will be possible to quantify the  evolution of plastic deformation from the center to the surface in dependence of the wire diameter, and accordingly to quantify the impact of pure strain gradients on the observed size effects for strength and hardening behaviour for the first time.  ","3916":"A polycrystal manifests abnormal grain growth (AGG) when a subset of grains grows rapidly into an environment of largely stagnant matrix grains. If allowed to proceed to completion, the final microstructure can be orders of magnitude coarser than in the initial state. AGG is far from a rare occurrence, but its underlying mechanism(s) continue to confound researchers\u2014the primary problem being a lack of time-resolved experimental data revealing the migration of abnormal\/matrix interfaces in 3D. Evidence suggests that local inhomogeneities in the distribution of crystallographic orientations as well as second-phase pinning particles play a decisive role in determining where in a specimen AGG occurs and how fast. By combining DCT + PCT scans, performed between sequential anneals of a commercial-grade aluminum alloy, we gain access to both distributions in 4D, which promises to deliver a robust experimental basis for resolving some of the open questions surrounding the phenomenon of AGG.","3917":"Ni superalloys are known for their outstanding performance under harsh environments. They can, however, suffer from stress corrosion cracking (SCC) when their applications involve high temperature, oxidative media, and mechanical loading. Stress Assisted Grain Boundary Oxidation (SAGBO) shares the same degradation patterns in a way to mimic such SCC degradation in time scales that are compatible with laboratory experiments. Therefore we propose an experiment to perform an in-situ analysis of SAGBO using 3D bulk characterization techniques. We intend to have initial grain maps obtained by diffraction contrast tomography, a time-lapse of phase contrast tomography volumes to feed digital image correlation routines and compare to the results of strain fields obtained by far-field X ray diffraction techniques.","3918":"Ceramic materials present an elastic-brittle behaviour at room temperature, leading to fracture before any sign of plasticity. This is linked to the low mobility of dislocations, compromising any ductility as is the case of metallic materials. Some zirconia-based ceramics can exhibit real plasticity at room temperature thanks to a martensitic phase transformation mechanism (tetragonal to monoclinic), similar to the transformation induced plasticity in shape-memory alloys. \r\nWith a stress and\/or temperature-controlled phase transformation as a source of toughening, zirconia doped with cerium oxide ceramics are particularly remarkable, with a plastic deformation on the order of one percent before rupture and lower sensitivity to the presence of defects. To fully describe this behavior, we conduct an in situ heating experiment with 3DXRD and DCT analyses, mapping out the strain tensors, as well as crystallographic orientations during the reverse phase transformation.\r\n","3919":"To understand the interrelation between strain localization & damage formation in relation to local self healing kinetics, we will characterize the distribution of local strains and orientations with a link to the distribution of creep cavities and healing precipitates as a function of creep time in a ternary model alloy and a computationally designed self healing high temperature steel. A multi imaging modality uniquely available on ID11 will be used to investigate samples after interrupted creep testing for different fractions of normal lifetimes: 1) distribution of creep cavities (sign of damage) and connected precipitates (sign of healing) by phase contrast tomography; 2) orientation and strain mapping by diffraction contrast tomography, topo-tomography and scanning 3D x-ray diffraction microscopy at multiple length scales. Results to be obtained are expected to provide more detailed guidelines for better tailoring the self healing capability of future creep-resistant steels.","3920":"Halide perovskites have attracted significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and potential applications in solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, etc. Nevertheless, being soft and ionic in nature, halide perovskites often exhibit ionic migration induced degradation during device operation. The aim of this project is to uncover the exact mechanism of ionic migration induced restructuring which is triggered by electric field. We will compare the role of several inhibitors (such as organic molecules, dopant, and polymers) which act as the barrier of the ionic migration. The structural dynamics under different electric field will be captured with both time and diffraction resolution. The full characterization of these phases will provide a mechanistic insights into the pathways underpinning the unwanted phase transformation and degradation, and ultimately allowing us to propose new methods to stabilize halide perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.","3921":"The relationship between macroscopic and microscopic stresses is central for a quantitative understanding of the mechanical behaviour of structural materials. The goal of this proposal is the validation and improvement of micromechanical methods to estimate local stresses for BCC polycrystalline materials. A particular focus lies on the Maximum-Entropy method (MEM) which is capable of predicting local stresses based on macroscopic mechanical properties and microstructural information. We propose to implement Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT) to determine the shape, arrangement, orientation and average elastic strain tensor of a representative ensemble of individual grains within a polycrystal for increasing tensile loading. Based on this unique experimental dataset, simulations and analytical methods can be combined to validate the MEM, yielding a new computationally extremely efficient approach for hierarchical materials informatics.","3922":"Aluminum foams are important in many applications. However, the microstructural evolution inside the foam cells walls\/ligaments has not yet been sufficiently studied. We propose measuring microstructure evolution in open-cell and closed-cell Al foams during an industrially relevant annealing protocol using phase-contrast and diffraction-contrast tomography (PCT and DCT, respectively). Such measurements will allow us to study the interaction between constituents of the microstructure and the macrostructure of the foams in 3D. In particular, we are interested in how precipitates in the foam\u2014easily identifiable from PCT\u2014interact with grain boundaries\u2014 located using DCT\u2014 during heat treatment.","3923":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate in situ the effect of hydrogen on the plasticity of industrially relevant metals. We will focus on studying the microstructure related effects of H-charging (i.e. local plasticity modification by cavities due to external deformation in steels). Porosity \u2013 left in the material during production \u2013 act as hydrogen traps, that alter locally the brittleness of the material. Crack initiation and propagation, grain orientation evolution, and brittle-to-ductile (BDT) transition coupled with the H-modified mechanical behaviour will be monitored during the proposed experiment.","3924":"Springback is defined as the behavior of the material when unloading the stress applied to it; if this behavior is linear, it is well understood and easily predictable because it is governed by classical elasticity. On the other hand, and this is the subject of our study, a non-linear unloading behavior is observed during the stamping of sheets for example and the mechanisms responsible for this behavior are poorly understood and controversial. Although many authors have observed nonlinear springback, paradoxically, few have observed it at fine scales and the hypotheses are numerous. Some authors attribute it to second-order elasticity, others to residual stress heterogeneities, fracture mechanisms, textural softening induced by deformation, detwinning,  but there is currently no direct evidence of this phenomenon.","3925":"Beamline ID11 is proposed in this project to determine the orientation relationships between nanoparticle(SiC nanowhisker here) and magnesium AZ91 alloy, as well as to visualise nano-SiC interacting with Mg matrix with different dispersion and manufacture processes, benefiting from the unique ID11 in combining of PCT, DCT and scanning-3DXRD for non-destructive multiscale characterisation. The results will be combined with our data from other techniques, enabling us to correlate the microstructural information of the metal composites to their mechanical performance via micromechanical models including grain refinement, load transfer, thermal mismatch and Orowan strengthening. The clear understanding of the correlations is not only important for our research of manufacturing optimisation and composite microstructure characterisation, but also for the whole community of metal nanocomposites to validate the effective reinforcing mechanisms, predict properties and post-process design.","3926":"Currently, million tons of recycled Al alloys are circulating around the world. The alloys contain multiple impurity elements and Fe is the most detrimental one, forming numerous brittle and irregularly-shaped Fe-rich intermetallics that harm the mechanical properties. We will study in real-time the atomic structure and multiphase evolution of the Fe intermetallics in 3 typical alloys: (1) Al-1.5%Fe, (2) Al-5%Cu-1.5%Fe and (3) Al-5%Cu-1.5%Fe-1%Si (weight percentage) in the solidification processes. The ESRF extreme bright source and the 3D X-ray diffraction microscopy can obtain the total scattering information at much shorter time scale in the liquid and partially crystalline state and the multiphase evolution afterwards. It will provide multiphase nucleation and growth information for the complex structures in the alloys from liquid to solid state which is critical for developing optimal strategies to remove or alter the Fe intermetallics into a less detrimental shape and morphology","3927":"Solid-state batteries (SSBs) hold enormous promise over traditional batteries with liquid electrolytes, primarily due to the ability to exploit the use of metallic Li as an anode, which can greatly improve cell capacity. However, instabilities in SSBs emanating from the Li metal | solid electrolyte interface currently hinder the long term cyclability of SSBs. The major cause of failure in SSBs is the nucleation and growth of cracks into the SSE, which when filled with metallic Li cause a short circuit. So far, there is a lack of chemo-mechanical understanding of what drives these cracks, and how they are filled with metallic Li. We propose to use 3D-XRD at the sub-grain scale to understand the role of microstructure, and intra-and inter granular stresses in the SSE close to the interface to develop an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the (i) propagation of cracks in the SSE and (ii) filling of the cracks with metallic Li. ","3928":"This proposal aims at discovering new electrocatalyst materials by probing in situ chemical reactions in inorganic liquids, ie. molten salts. Based on machine learning to identify a priori the composition ranges most likely to provide new compounds, we will target solids made of Earth-abundant elements Fe, B and P and of interest for electrocatalytic water splitting. Molten salts enable reactions at 300-1000 \u00b0C and offer a chemical space to explore thanks to a parameter never considered before: the chemical hardness of the solvent anions, by adjusting molten salt mixtures. This sets the stage for the discovery of new materials compared to traditional methods. We will use in situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction and in situ total X-ray scattering coupled to PDF analysis to identify reaction intermediates and new solids. The reaction conditions identified in situ will then be used in our lab to isolate these solids, which will deliver new materials for electrocatalysis.","3929":"Refractory metal high entropy superalloys (RSA) look set to offer a step change in temperature capability over existing high temperature alloys. However, the transformation sequences that lead to their two-phase A2-B2 microstructures are yet to be fully understood, preventing process optimisation. Current hypotheses are based on a spinodal decomposition but ordering must also occur given the formation of the B2 phase. Direct characterisation of these transformation sequences, along with identification of the key transformation temperatures is imperative to this field.  Here, in a follow up to MA4490, we propose to use high energy monochromatic diffraction to conclusively establish the evolution of the microstructure of a systematic study of four RSA for the first time. ","3930":"Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are porous hybrid materials deriving from the combination of organic linkers and inorganic building blocks. Creation and engineering of defects in MOFs offers an additional dimension of opportunities for tailor-made materials, since local defects have direct implications in the resulting properties. In this proposal, we aim to apply incisive Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analyses to gain insight on the local structure of functionalized Zr(IV)-MOFs with capacity to remove persistent water pollutants.","3931":"The global concern about uncontrolled release of drugs into the environment demands new materials for their detection and monitoring. In this regard, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are suitable candidates as platforms for the optical detection of drugs in water. We have introduced lanthanide ions (Sm3+, Gd3+, Tb3+) into two robust Zr-MOFs containing two types of clusters (Zr6 and Zr12), namely MOF-808 and MIP-206. Ln-sites within MOFs act as optical probes whose emission can be shifted in the presence of a particular contaminant (e.g., antibiotics). The aim of this proposal is to apply incisive Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analyses to elucidate the local structure of Ln-doped Zr-MOFs active in the capture of emerging drugs found in water sources.","3932":"In this study, highly accurate experimental data obtained from post printing heat treated LPBF additively manufactured body using the strain tomography technique, that was developed using the measurements in ESRF in 2006, will be used for the determination of creep properties, the eigenstrain reconstruction of full-field residual strains, strain relaxation and creep strain, and the analysis of PPHT parameters. The proposed experiment is the continuation of previous successful experiment that was performed using as-printed LPBF additively manufactured body at the beam-time of Proposal MA5208 awarded by ESRF. Full field eigenstrain reconstruction of residual stresses will be conducted after diffraction data collected from 5 planes and processed using the strain tomography technique. The data collection of this technique is similar to the conventional absorption tomography, but the set-up used for strain tomography quantifies lattice spacing rather than density.","3933":"The Near edge x-ray absorption helps to identify fine structural changes, which are difficult to observe with a normal x-ray diffractometer. We have recently developed a new strategy to prepare hybrid perovskite (HPV) with improved optoelectronic properties and charge carrier lifetime. We hypothesize that these improvements originate from the high quality of the perovskite crystals. Specifically, we presume that improving the crystallinity of the HPV prevents the photoreduction of Pb2+ to Pb0 and protects the HPV layer from further degradation. To verify this hypothesis, this proposal aims to investigate (1) the coordination environment of Pb and I as well as their oxidation state using XAS and (2) the crystallinity of the HPV thin films upon moisture and light exposure using GIWAXS. ","3934":"Among several materials proposed for safe and efficient solid-state hydrogen storage, alloys and intermetallics are the most promising candidates. We are currently studying the series of bcc (TiZrNbHf)80V20-xTax (x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20) high entropy alloys forming high-capacity hydrides. Despite the same initial bcc lattice and close chemical composition (80 %), the phase transition pathway during the reaction with H is different: H absorption in V-rich and Ta-rich alloys shows one and two-step reaction, respectively. However, it is not clear yet, which parameters influence this phase transformation: electronic properties, local structure, or lattice strain. Thus, we propose to study here the phase transformation at local level in this series of alloys during the first H absorption\/desorption by in situ X-ray total scattering and associated PDF analysis. This will help understanding the H absorption pathway at local level for further design of high-capacity materials.","3935":"Sodium-ion batteries are the most promising alternative to lithium-ion battery technology, highly needed to meet the always growing demand for energy storage capability. The development of highly performing cathodes is the crucial step for their commercialization. Layered oxides with formula Nax(Mn\/TM)O2 (TM Transition metal ions; 0<x<1.5) are the most appealing due to their suitable potential and high theoretical capacity. Their phase diagram is highly complicated due to the presence of several phase transitions among layered structures driven by the sodium content, Mn\/TM ratio, and temperature. Despite the small changes in composition, the actual crystal structure is crucial in determining the electrochemical performance.\r\nHere we propose to investigate the structural evolution of the series NaxMn0.5Ni0.5O2 with 0.7<x<1.1 through in-situ high-temperature diffraction analysis (500\u00b0-1000\u00b0C range, where phase transitions have been reported for similar compositions) at ID22\r\n","3936":"We propose to characterize \u201cin-situ\u201d the large strain produced under an applied magnetic field by high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction in Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe2 alloy as a function of the temperature. Our preliminary results already showed a spectacular magnetic field induced phase transition. High resolution will permit to determine the structural origin of the magnetostriction in this material in the temperature magnetic field space.","3939":"Spinodal Cu Ni Sn alloys are widely used for bushings and bearings in aerospace and automotive applications. However, their susceptibility to softening and embrittlement during thermal exposure presents a commercial challenge. These changes have been linked to over-ageing, accompanied by discontinuous precipitation, which eliminates the desired modulated structure and metastable coherent precipitates. However, a phenomenological theory to explain the observed trends remains lacking. In this experiment, high resolution diffraction data will be acquired in situ from Cu 15Ni 8Sn (wt%) samples during exposures at 350, 400, and 450\u00b0C for 1000 mins. This will enable characterisation of the microstructural evolution. The results obtained will allow reliable quantification of the lattice parameters of the constituent phases, the wavelength of compositional modulation, the size of coherent precipitates, and the volume fraction of discontinuous precipitation.","3940":"We propose studying model interfaces between metal catalysts and polymers with high-energy surface X-ray diffraction (HESXRD) to better understand the structural motifs occurring at an interface critical in efforts to chemically recycle plastic. Our results will significantly improve the atomic level understanding of the catalyst interface, in particular the catalyst surface reconstruction and the arrangement and coordination of various hydrocarbon chain lengths as a function of environment. For polymer hydrogenolysis chain length has been shown to impact reactivity and selectivity toward desired liquid products. Understanding the structure of the catalysts surface and the hydrocarbon chains near the catalyst interface is of utmost importance. Comparing our structural results to simulations from molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) will allow us a deepen our insight into the adsorbed structure of polymers under reactive conditions.","3941":"Sodium solid state batteries are one of the very few viable solutions for energy storage for stationary systems. Several solid electrolytes are reported with impressive ionic conductivity up to 40 mS\/cm, among them the Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4. To date, the synthesis of this solid electrolyte is poorly described and deserve a proper investigation to understand Na-ion transport mechanism. We propose to study the phase formation and transitions upon temperature (up to 550 \u00b0C) of the Na2.88Sb0.88W0.12S4 by collecting X-ray diffractograms of mechanochemically pretreated reactants.","3942":"Portland cement generates about 0.8 tons of CO2 per cement ton, which contributes to ~7% of total CO2 emissions. Cements with a low-CO2 footprint include Fe-rich (or Ca2FeAlO5-rich or in cement notation C4AF-rich) cement manufactured using industrial wastes such as iron slags, which reduce cement clinkering temperature and the amount of limestone (CaCO3) used. However, the synthesis procedure, including the sintering temperature, heating, and cooling rate affects the structure of C4AF. Furthermore, industrial wastes contain a range of minor elements that may affect the C4AF reactivity. In this work, we propose to investigate the formation and atomic structure evolution upon heating and cooling of C4AF as well as the effects of dopant elements (Zn and Mn) through in-situ X-ray diffraction and total scattering experiments. This study's results will help identify suitable iron slags and synthesis procedures for producing iron-rich low CO2 cement.","3944":"Energy storage devices are essential components for the incoming massive electrification of the car fleet.  \u201cAnode-free\u201d battery is the holy grail in battery research domain, where the only source of lithium is initially present in the positive electrode material (e.g. LiNMC). A simple copper current collector is used at the negative side to ensure the Li plating.\r\nIn this work, we propose to investigate the formation and properties of the SEI as function of the (negative) electrode potential (1 to 0 V vs Li+\/Li) in operando mode coupling grazing incidence X-ray scattering techniques with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Additionally, nucleation and growth of lithium (orientation, size, texture) will be analyzed by further decreasing the applied potential below 0 V vs Li+\/Li. Finally, the potential will be relaxed, and the kinetics of the corrosion process (nuclei dissolution) will be characterized. \r\n","3945":"Solid-state batteries hold promise to improve energy density without sacrificing safety. An intimate contact between solid electrolyte and cathode is key to batteries' energy density, rate capability and cyclability. However, it is challenging to form such solid-solid contact, especially when using thick cathodes for energy density. We developed a new polymer electrolyte that delivers attractive electrochemical performances even when matched with thick cathodes, and the functioning mechanism is unknown. Preliminary tests at ID31 show that the polymer only reaches half of cathode thickness in the assembled cell, but impregnates into the whole depth of the cathode after the first electrochemical charge-discharge. We therefore propose to monitor the polymer impregnation process during battery operation to discover when and how it is triggered. The in situ wetting mechanism revealed by this study may be provide insights to design polymer electrolytes and solid-state batteries.","3946":"CO2 electrolysis (CO2E) based on the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configuration has attracted great attention for synthesizing value-added chemicals. However, MEA-based CO2E often suffers from poor stability and selectivity variations. Flooding of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and the formation of salt precipitation in the GDE cause CO2 mass transport limitations at the catalyst layer, which in turn increases competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. These results indicate that the structure of catalyst layer (CL) and ion transport mechanism of anion exchange membrane (AEM) could largely influence both flooding and salt precipitation in the GDE. In this proposal, we expect proper hydrophobicity of CL and permeability of AEM could alleviate the flooding\/salt precipitation by regulating accessibility of water transport from the anode side.  We plan to employ different GDEs with varying hydrophobicity of CL and different AEMs with varying water uptake to optimize the water transport.","3947":"Understanding degradation of iridium oxide (IrOx) as the electrocatalyst of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolyzer is crucial to overcome the current challenge in water electrolyzer commercialization. Electrolyzers currently use high loadings of IrOx to compensate for the loss of IrOx during operation due to degradation. To enable smaller stacks that are more cost competitive with less IrOx use, operation at higher current densities (higher H2 production rates) is desirable. However, at these high current densities (>10 A\/cm2) proton exchange membrane (PEM) can suffer from local dehydration, especially at the stack outlets. The main goal of this project is to understand degradation of IrOx by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the water distribution in PEM by using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) while operating electrolyzers at high current density (~10 A\/cm2).","3948":"In the proposed experiment we want to study two magnetic field induced transitions in the giant magnetocaloric Gd5Si2Ge2 and Gd5Si0.5Ge3.5 compounds. By leveraging from the opportunity of simultaneously measuring various atomic and macroscopic parameters at ID12 beamline we aim to perform a thorough study of how the magnetic and structural transitions are (de)coupled. In particular, Synchrotron circularly polarized x-ray beam at ID12 will allow us to probe element specific magnetism (XMCD) and correlated it to simultaneously measured macroscopic properties. Hence, we propose to measure simultaneously XMCD, Hall probe magnetization, XRD and magnetostriction with strain gages as a function of temperature, magnetic field and time. We aim to unveil the fine details of magnetostructural coupling in these materials and learn on how to tailor them towards optimal magnetocaloric energy conversion efficiency. ","3949":" With the proposed experiments we want to explore magnetism of Ce in an element-specific manner as compared to the macroscopic magnetism in Ce intermetallic compounds. We want to determine the Ce valency for different Ce compounds by spectral analysis of the Ce L3-edge and correlate it to the 5d magnetism in Ce by measurement of the Ce L-edges. This we will correlate to the observed overall magnetic properties like magnetization and coercive field and their theoretical expectation to disentangle the role of Ce 5d electrons in Ce intermetallic compounds.","3950":"The goal of the study is the characterization of magnetic Ti3C2Tx-based MXenes produced via partial \r\ndesorption of Tx functional groups and subsequent Fe intercalation. Such magnetic MXene flakes show an \r\nordering temperature of about 500 K as our laboratory-based magnetometry studies suggest. However, we \r\ncould not directly correlate the structure, the chemical state and the magnetic response on the identical \r\nsample, yet, since X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\r\n(XPS) and magnetometry have different demands. Here, we aim to collect combined information by \r\ndiffraction, XANES and XMCD in the identical sample states using the new and unique ULMAG end station\r\nat ID12. While many theoretical papers predict magnetic MXenes, there is no experimental realization with \r\na clear spectroscopic proof and element-specific magnetic data to date.","3951":"During experiment MI-1429, we imaged the magnetic texture of a teardrop-shape sample in Permalloy by Fourier-transform holography (FTH). To our surprise, the domain wall consisted of several Bloch-wall-type segments of alternating polarities. As MI-1429 was a 3D imaging experiment, we did not apply magnetic field to avoid perturbating the texture. Now we would like to do so, in order to elucidate the origin of the non-uniform domain wall polarity. Is this the equilibrium configuration, or does it arise from pinning on extrinsic defects? How does it react to weak magnetic field? Can we eventually manipulate the number of segments, in the perspective to encode information? We will this time focus on a 2D imaging procedure under applied magnetic field. \r\n","3952":"Modelling the thermodynamic behaviour of sub-stoichiometric, ternary oxides such as (U1\u2013yPuy)O2\u2013x or its less hazardous analog (U1-yCey)O2\u2013x, constitutes a scientific and industrial challenge in the context of optimizing these fuels for fast neutron and pressurized water reactor applications. Past XRD studies report a phase separation in oxygen deficient U-Ce-O and U-Pu-O systems (e.g. U0.5Ce0.5O1.95 compounds), in which the high temperature disordered fluorite phase gives way to two fluorite phases, stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric, at some point below 400\u00b0C. Neutron diffraction experiments suggest however that the low temperature sub-stoichiometric phase is probably not a fluorite. The exact nature of the phase transition mechanism, has not, as yet, been clearly identified and it is thought the key to this, lies in understanding in situ, the interplay between mobile anion vacancies and polaronic disorder involving Ce3+, Ce4+, U4+, U5+ ions.","3953":"The goal of this project is to study MXene Ti3C2Tx  synthesis in situ using reaction of T3AlC2 (MAX-phase) with LiF\/HCl. So far, this method was studied only ex situ by characterization of reaction products and only after washing these products with water. The structural changes due to exposure of Max phase to etching solution will be studied in our experiments. We expect to reveal possible intermediate phases, effects of lattice expansion and swelling  of Max phase in process of synthesis. According to literature data, variations of synthesis procedure (temperature, duration of annealing and loading proportion between initial components) strongly affect properties of final MXene in several applications, e.g. as supercapacitor electrode. We will perform set of in situ synthesis experiments with progressively increased load temperature of reaction (400C to 600C) and increased excess of LiF\/HCl.

In contrast to tomography, in situ laminography allows the evolution of the microstructure and damage as well as strain (via image correlation techniques) to be studied in the plane strain tension zone. In\r\naddition, the role of pre-strain on failure in plane strain tension will be investigated by performing a load path change on a newly designed sample.

Bifunctional catalysts containing an acid and a hydrogenation functionality are crucial for this technology. Designing new catalyst formulations to outperform with different feed compositions needs the understanding of the relationship between preparation, microstructure and performance under different conditions. In proposed experiment we will investigate hydrocracking catalyst extrudates at the nanoscale using nearfield ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (PCXT), that were deactivated in real industrial catalytic reactors where the oil feed compositions have different chemical nature.

By characterizing the electrode with high spatial resolution and associating with the chemomechanical reactivity and morphological deformation of hundreds to thousands of identified active doped High-Nickel and Low-Cobalt cathodes  particles, we aim to develop a theoretical inter- and intra- particle model that could predict the mechanical failure in the high-Ni and low-Co cathode.  \r\n","3968":"To meet the rapid goals of electrification of the transport sector, it is imperative to build batteries that have a higher capacity, and are resilient and safe. One of the  popular ways of achieving this is by using high Ni NMC (LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2) cathodes, at higher voltages. This is achieved by substituting Ni for Co in the NMC material. However, this higher capacity per cycle comes at the cost of cycling stability. Particularly when accessing high voltages, these materials are prone to cracking.

New research suggests that when the transformation takes place in a supercritical thermodynamic state, the material can exhibit exceptional reversibility and low hysteretic or \u201canhysteretic\u201d behaviors. Based on previous X-ray diffraction studies, we hypothesize that supercritical martensitic phase transformations take place via a gradual transformation of the lattice. Our goal is to test this hypothesis by imaging the microstructure evolution as the material approaches and surpasses the critical point using in-situ dark-field X-ray microscopy during electrical biasing BaTiO3 at different temperatures. The expected outcome is a fundamental understanding of supercritical behavior in multiferroic materials, leading to the design of new multiferroics with exceptional reversibility and hysteretic properties.","4000":"Hydrogen (H) is essential to decarbonize industry, but its use today is limited because it embrittles the metals and alloys required to store\/distribute it. Despite 150 years of research, the fundamental mechanisms of H-embrittlement are still poorly understood. H atoms form a solid solution of interstitials in structural metals that affect the behavior of dislocations. While dislocations are essential to understand plasticity and deformations, it is still unclear whether H enhances or reduces their mobility. This matter is hotly debated, as no technique can measure dislocations and their motion deep inside bulk crystals during stress. We developed time-resolved and 3D dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) and use it to study the interactions of deep subsurface dislocations. We now seek to use DFXM to directly measure how H alters the structure and interactions forces between dislocations, offering the first direct measurements to reconcile conflicting H-altered mobility models.","4001":"Near-equiatomic TiNi alloys with thermoelastic martensite transformations, shape memory effect and superelasticity are used in engineering and medicine.

MPT is a diffusionless transformation between high-symmetry and low-symmetry crystallographic phases. It is the enabling mechanism behind the behaviors of such advanced materials as shape memory alloys (SMAs). However, fundamental knowledge gaps regarding hysteresis and functional fatigue continue to be persistent barriers. Recently, empirical research showed that hysteresis dramatically decreases when kinematic compatibility is increased. Here, we will use in-situ X-ray topotomography (XRTT) during stress-induced MPT to characterize the effect of kinematic compatibility on microstructure. We will compare two NiTiPd SMAs: one with high compatibility\/low hysteresis, and one alloy with low compatibility\/large hysteresis.

In the case of technical applications of MICP, the durability of biocemented materials, such as sand, in aggressive environments must be evaluated. Exposure to weakly acidic waters, for example, triggers the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystals that bridge the sand grains and decreases the strength of the material. The mechanical properties of biocemented sand are linked to the contact properties due to the CaCO3 crystal bridges. Here, we aim to investigate the role of the different polymorphs and orientations of CaCO3 crystals on the evolution of the contact properties during dissolution.

In this experimental proposal, we want to map the p-n junction boundary of a polycrystalline silicon solar cell and understand how it changes as a function of misorientation between grains which lie along the p-n junction and temperature.","4012":"Advanced surface characterisation techniques were used to identify microplasticity at high temperature on a polycrystalline nickel-base superalloy at different strain rates. High resolution digital image correlation and laser confocal scanning microscopy aimed at detecting both displacement\/height jumps due to discrete slip activity and surface slope due to crystal reorientation. Preliminary results demonstrated the role of the deformation rate on the strain partitioning at grain boundaries, twin boundaries and within grains. The goal of this proposal is to complement surface analyses with volumetric analyses to identify sub-surface onset of damage (cavitation, cracks, etc.) using a combination of diffraction contrast tomography for both grain orientation and morphology and phase contrast tomography for damage identification.

To date, these applications have been nearly exclusively based on solid solutions of lead zirconate and lead titanate (PZT).  Despite a number of advantages, the lead content makes both manufacturing and disposal of PZT hazardous to people and environment. Therefore, legislative conditions motivated research efforts into the development of a lead-free alternative.  While many lead-free piezoelectric compositions exist, further enhancement of their properties through compositional engineering alone is unlikely to yield ongoing developments.  These experiments will demonstrate the mechanism associated with sample thickness dependent enhancements in properties, that are a promising method for the ongoing development of lead-free piezoelectrics.","4016":"All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with Li-metal anodes are a promising solution to enable safe, high-capacity Li-ion batteries.

We have developed two new SSEs based on the popular Li6PS5Cl SSE which aim to provide improved strain relief throughout cycling, thereby maintaining contact with the cathode and improving cycle life. By using X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) correlated with absorption contrast x-ray computed tomography (XCT), we propose to study how stress from volume change of the cathode during cycling is relieved via (a) strain fields within the SSE and (b) delamination between cathode particles and the surrounding SSE.

Component lifetime is limited by their susceptibility to mechanical damage due to their low strength. A widely used alloy, Au30Pt1Rh at.%, can be aged to a hardness of 255 HV. While higher Pt containing alloys can achieve higher hardness values, the narrow gap between solvus and solidus temperatures (heat treatment window) introduces a risk of incipient melting during homogenisation. We have developed an AuPtPd alloy with high hardness (338 HV) and a wide heat treatment window. STEM images reveal that the alloy has a modulated microstructure after cooling, while XRD patterns show evidence of an additional low symmetry phase.

Main objective is to define the core's behavior during high-rate compression. In previous tests two collapse modes were identified, but due to the inability of applied testing methods to visualize events in-situ, the sub-surface behaviour is not known, hindering the comprehensive understanding of the collapse mechanism. To address this, we will use  synchrotron MHz X-ray phase contrast imaging (MHz-XPCI) measurements coupled to the Split Hopkinson Compression bar (SHPB) to  track in-situ damage propagation of the core and compare energy absorption and pressure attenuation properties of specimens.The obtained results will be of great importance for refinement of sandwich typologies and for calibration and improvement of accompanying numerical models used for their design.","4042":"The zinc-ion battery (ZIB) is one of the promising candidates for next-generation energy storage devices beyond lithium-ion technology owing to the earth\u2019s abundance of Zn materials, low cost, moderate toxicity, and high volumetric energy density (5855 mAh cm-3). However, to date, technical challenges remain to hinder the practical application of ZIBs. One of the most notorious issues is dendritic formation during the battery operations.

The goal is to understand how 3D-printed biodegradable scaffolds must be customized, patient-specifically, to stabilize and reinforce fractured bone, i.e., to be in mechanical and dynamical harmony with the surrounding bone while stimulating bone regeneration. ","4044":"Dendritic growth is an important phenomenon responsible for the evolving microstructure in almost all commercially important metals and alloys. The key in understanding dendrite patterns is to study the shape and stability of the dendrite tips, since they stand at the beginning of the morphological evolution. The dendrite tip parameters (growth velocity, tip shape and its radius) in metals are very important for extending the experimental validation of dendrite growth theories towards metallic materials. Since the tip region exhibits the strongest dynamics and smallest length scales within a dendritic structure, its imaging is accompanied by significant noise, which prevents a straight-forward use of standard analysis methods. A quantitative study of the dendrite tip dynamics and its operating state at high resolution, in time and space requires high-performance X-ray techniques that can be only provided by synchrotron sources.","4045":"This proposal aims to study transverse cracking and kinking of composite materials using time-resolved X-ray multi-projection imaging (XMPI) to acquire 3D measurements of such dynamics not possible with state-of-the-art time-resolved tomography.

Those steels are used to manufacture pressure vessels or piping, and is likely to occur in the development of promising technologies close to the carbon neutrality such as the power to gas and biomass retreatments. HTHA leads to the formation of cavities full of methane in depth of the material. As ageing in hydrogen atmosphere progresses the cavities grow and coalesce until cracking occurs. The mechanical strength of the steels is thus reduced (high risk of rupture). It is necessary to understand the origin of HTHA at the early stages, and to predict the evolution of the cavities in order to prevent accidents. High resolution X-ray tomography is the most suitable technique to characterize the small cavities (size and localization) at the early stages of the attack.

We focus here on the apatite-like Dy4.67(SiO4)3O compound, which has a high melting point and has the potential for applications at a higher temperature compared to standard materials like yttria stabilized zirconia (1400\u00b0C) [1]. However, this structure has a partial occupancy of one of dysprosium sites which raises a concern on the slow ordering of dysprosium vacancies which might compromise the long-term stability of the material.

Despite silicon anodes' technological potential, our understanding of electro-chemo-mechanical phenomena, including strain formation, new phase evolution, amorphization, and re-crystallization, is limited during charge and discharge cycles. This experiment will develop an operando cell with coarse-grained Si crystallites for ID03. Using near- and far-field detectors, individual Si crystals will be selected, and their structural transformations during lithiation will be tracked.

","4090":"Hydrogen absorption in steel induces embrittlement, reducing tensile strength, fatigue resistance, and fracture toughness. In duplex steel, hydrogen expands the austenitic fcc crystal structure while leaving the ferritic bcc lattice unchanged. This expansion near the surface encounters resistance, leading to in-plane compressive stresses in both phases. Hydrogen uptake induces plastic deformation in austenite, contrasting with the unaffected ferrite. These findings were observed in bulk steels using in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction. Our proposed DFXM experiment aims to deepen understanding by scrutinizing intragranular strain and mosaicity changes during hydrogen uptake in individual grains of fcc and bcc phases. The primary goal is to meticulously track hydrogen uptake by analyzing lattice parameter changes, providing unprecedented insights into the microstructural dynamics of hydrogen interaction with specific grains, grain boundaries, and defects in duplex steel. ","4091":"Understanding the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in advanced structural metals is essential for future infrastructures in hydrogen-based energy industries. HE has been long recognized in metals, but it is still not fully understood because H is related to multiple embrittlement phenomena, e.g., from the activation of plastic flow (i.e., dislocation-H interaction) to crack propagation. The change in dislocation behaviors under H influence alters the deformation behavior of metals. Therefore, a systematic characterization of the formation and evolution of dislocation patterns exposed to H environment plays a salient role in understanding HE mechanisms. Thus, this experiment aims to investigate the 3D dislocation structures in single-crystal nickel upon tensile deformation exposed to H environment. Here, we propose to employ ex-situ synchrotron dark-field X-ray microscopy to quantitatively map the strain field of dislocations and to reveal the evolution of the dislocation patterns in 3D.

Extensive researches have been performed on the evolution of pores in Al 2050 alloys using in-situ synchrotron micro and nano-tomography, and the resulting analytical models validate pore closure, whilst fail to predict pore growth in tensile mechanical state in the presence of Fe-containing intermetallics. This is mainly due to a lack of good knowledge on the local experimental mechanical state and strain field around pores which is highly influenced by the intermetallics. In this proposal, we will use multi-mode imaging techniques to map the orientations, the stress field (elastic strain) and the global strain field of the matrix grains in 3D, and link such information with the evolution of pores and intermetallic particles during in-situ tensile testing.","4096":"In modern multiphase materials, damage initiation and growth usually occur during forming and service. The key to understand the initiation and growth of voids in such materials is the characterization of the microstructural mechanisms in a statistically relevant manner over a large number of damage sites. Here, we propose to use DCT scans to determine the shape, arrangement, orientation and grain average elastic strain tensor of a representative ensemble of grains (4000-9000 grains) during mechanical loading of samples of age-hardened Al6010 multiphase alloys. Based on grain shape and orientation as well as the strain and stress distribution, plastic strain localizations can be detected and the specific morphological and crystallographic boundary conditions for the strain localization and subsequent damage initiation can be analysed in detail The \u201csingle grain\u201d behaviour and specific nearest neighbour correlations will be used as input parameters for CP-FEM modelling.","4097":"In order to improve the mechanical properties of Fe-Al welds (as a promising and cost-efficient method to support car weight decrease) understanding the formation mechanisms of Fe-Al intermetallic compounds (IMC) is key.

Molten alkali-alkaline earth chloride salts are promising heat transfer fluids for solar power plants and future molten salt reactors, where they could also act as fuel components. Their use raises important challenges related to the selection of structural materials in contact with molten salts. Indeed, Fe- and Ni-based alloys are corroded in contact with molten salts and often display intergranular corrosion. To solve this urgent concern, one needs to understand corrosion mechanisms and kinetics, especially the evolution of grain boundaries (GB). To do so, we want to monitor corrosion in situ by using 3D X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and tomography (PCT).

They are additively manufactured by binder jetting, which produces stress and crack-free parts with isotropic properties. However, the mechanical properties of the WC-Co parts strongly depend on the binder content, WC grain size and its distribution. Moreover, the binder jetting process of WC-Co involves a sintering densification phase that results in volumetric shrinkage of the printed part. That being said, in the proposed experiment, we intend to couple in-situ sintering of WC-Co green parts, produced through binder jetting, with synchrotron X-ray tomography and diffraction. 3D image analysis and the simultaneous knowledge of the present phases will yield detailed insights into the sintering process and will allow us to understand the influence of printing parameters and the initial properties of green parts on sintering mechanisms.","4101":"This proposal intends to conduct an in-situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiment during high-temperature loading on a novel additively\r\nmanufactured (AM) Al-La alloys, which exhibits an exceptional high-temperature strength due to the thermally stable nano eutectic cellular network (nano-ECN)\r\nmicrostructure.

Our discovery reveals HEs can serve as secondary redox-active centers along side primary redox material LiFePO4, boosting cell capacity by several tens of percent. Leveraging chloride redox chemistry, approximately 50% of electrons are extracted during charging, with 25% recoverable upon discharge which is therefore presumably due to bulk modifications like phase transformation.

In this context, we reported [Eu(BTC)(H2O)6] (Eu-1, H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) [Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 2313045]. Its progressive dehydration (343-423 K), triggering a phase transition, alters the shape of the Eu(III) ions emission spectrum and the depopulation kinetics of their 5D0 level, making Eu-1 a multiparametric thermal history phosphor (THP) with record relative sensitivity in ratiometric and decay kinetics modes (11.3 and 1.8%\/K). HR- and HE-PXRD, in situ heating Eu-1 in the range 303-423 K, will disclose the structural changes underneath the observed performance, from both a periodic (HR-PXRD plus \u201cclassical\u201d structural analyses) and a local perspective (HE-PXRD plus total scattering analyses).

Despite their significance, characterizing these structures is challenging due to their small size and complex compositions. Traditional techniques like SEM and TEM offer limited insights and may damage samples. While X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) provides useful out-of-plane electron density profiles, it lacks in-plane spatial resolution. This proposal introduces High Energy XRR Tomography (HEXRR-Tomo) to overcome this limitation. Unlike conventional XRR, HEXRR-Tomo enables spatial mapping of the entire surface, facilitating high-resolution 3D electron density map reconstruction. This non-destructive technique promises insights into layer thickness, density, and roughness, advancing understanding of junction structure and properties.","4110":"Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is a promising pathway to convert detrimental CO2 emissions into sustainable fuels and chemicals. The use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), in which CO2 is supplied directly from the gas phase, enables achieving remarkable activity and product selectivity. Despite these progresses, GDEs undergo fast degradation during eCO2R (10s hours) due to the precipitation of hygroscopic (bi)carbonate crystals within the GDE caused by excessive CO2 dissolution. Stability can be improved by regularly interrupting the eCO2R (pulsed electrolysis), even though the reason behind the improvement is still unclear. Here, we propose to employ operando wide-angle X-rays scattering to study (bi)carbonate precipitation, (bi)carbonate re-dissolution during pulsed electrolysis using variable pulse lengths, frequencies, and voltages. Our results will provide important understanding of GDE degradation processes, as well as relevant guidelines for technological advances.","4111":"One of the challenges to advance so called anode-free Na-batteries is the homogenization of Na-metal deposition. Recently, thin alloy-layers are applied onto the current collector to homogenize Na-deposition through their sodiophilicity. However, the detailed structural evolution of the electrochemically Na-alloyed phases is not understood, as the kinetically driven process might give rise to meta-stable phases and\/or amorphous intermediate phases - while the properties of these phases will determine the nucleation barrier and smoothness of Na-plating. To determine the structure-activity relationship, we want to resolve the electrochemically induced alloying between Na and a 100 nm thin Au-alloy layer via ex-situ gracing incidence pair distribution function and small angle X-ray scattering experiments. The Au layer can be considered as a model system and the results are expected to impact the understanding on how to design nucleation functional layers for anode-free Na-metal batteries.","4112":"CO2 reduction (CO2RR) bears promising capabilities that could aid in reaching net-zero targets by closing the carbon cycle. Cu has been shown to be the only metal that can catalyse the transfer of more than two electrons during CO2RR, thus, generating more valuable C2+ molecules. Nanoporous Cu made by dealloying brass usually have high surface distortion, which manifests as microstrain. Our recent study shows that such microstrain acts to enhance the catalytic properties of Cu for CO2RR. However, due to the high surface mobility of Cu atoms, and the extremely harsh cathodic condition of CO2RR, preserving such high microstrain still remians challenging. The use of synchrotron-based diffraction method will enable the detailed observation of how dealloying-induced Cu lattice strain evolves during the CO2RR condition and other electrochemical dealloying condition, which can help us outline new strategies for CO2RR catalyst design, and also to uncover more aspects of dealloying of brass.\r\n","4113":"An important hurdle in water electrolysis originates from the fact that the reactants of the anode reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, are singlet molecules, whereas the oxygen molecule has a triplet ground state with parallel spin alignment. In line with this idea, enhanced OER activity was achieved by inducing ferro- and ferrimagnetic long-range magnetic order in catalysts, but the enhancement mechanism remains largely elusive. Using X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) this study will provide insights into the magnetic behavior of thin film oxide catalysts under operando OER conditions which will directly connect the spin-spin interactions in the catalyst to the (changes in) OER activity.

We have developed a CuO\/WO3 heterojunction catalyst that gives a higher NH3 yield (1057 \u00b5g\/h\/mg) in the presence of visible light, which is 2.8-fold higher in comparison to the absence of light at the same applied potential (\u22121.4 V vs. Ag\/AgCl). This means photoelectrons play a critical role in the nitrate reduction at CuO\/WO3 heterojunction by influencing the CuO active sites. We propose to perform in-situ XANES to monitor Cu K and W L3-edge energies and EXAFS to understand shift in oxidation states and local coordination of the metal ions under applied potential in presence of 400 nm light.

The introduction of these dopants into the UO2 system can intrinsically alter the crystal chemistry and local speciation of the system, which in turn influences the oxidation behaviour. This may have negative consequences on the aqueous corrosion of the U-O system and therefore influence the safety of spent nuclear fuel in a geological disposal facility. In this proposal, we aim to understand the influence of metal dopants (Al, Cr, Ti) on the local structure, speciation and radiolytic dissolution of [001]-oriented UO2 single crystal thin films.We will systematically understand the local structure and speciation of U and metal dopants as a function of dopant type and concentration (HERFD-XANES), and we will quantify the dissolution of these materials through in-situ corrosion experiments performed using XRD.","4117":"Rapid capacity fade and voltage drop are the major problems for lithium-rich cathode materials.

The use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) fed by gaseous CO2 enables achieving high activity and selectivity, albeit with limited stability. We recently demonstrated by operando wide-angle X-rays scattering that, during continuous electrolysis, (bi)carbonate crystals precipitate close to the catalyst, causing GDE instability. Strikingly, preliminary pulsed electrolysis experiments show that (bi)carbonate precipitation can take place without losses of GDE selectivity, leading to a 10-fold increase in GDE stability. As the catalyst can oxidize during the pulses, we propose to use operando X-rays absorption spectroscopy to investigate the role of catalyst oxidation state in controlling GDE selectivity and stability during pulsed electrolysis, as this holds the key to stable eCO2R.","4120":"This proposal aims to investigate changes in iron oxide-based nanoheterostructures within the cellular environment for potential biomedical applications.

The main obstacle for DRM is the lack of reforming catalysts with high catalytic activity and high stability due to the high operating temperatures required and coke deposition. The high temperature imposes another challenge of the high energy demand needed to drive the endothermal reaction. A promising approach is to combine a photothermal DRM process with single atom Pt catalysts on CeO2 to overcome the beforehand mentioned limitations. It is an effective strategy to manipulate the coordination environment of Pt atoms to promote the cracking of C\u2013H bonds limiting carbon deposition and prevent deactivation.

However, it exhibits a gradual loss of strength beyond its Hugoniot elastic limit, attributed to the formation of boron vacancies within the C-B-C chains along the c-axis under mechanical stress. To extend its plastic regime to higher constraints, the proposed approach is to strengthen the C-B-C chains that link the icosahedra of B4C. The objective is to substitute Boron atoms in the chains with Silicon using high pressure and high temperature (HP-HT). Thus, our aim is to investigate the HP-HT synthesis of Si-doped B4C phase, ensuring the absence of parasitic Si-C or Si-B compounds, through the direct reaction between molten Silicon and solid Boron carbide. This synthesis will be performed under HP-HT conditions where Silicon is liquid, preventing the formation of unwanted compounds.\r\n","4126":"This proposal is devoted to study the structural evolution and the P-T stability of borax and probertite, two natural hydrated borates mineral. Critically, borax is one of the main ore minerals of boron, a critical element for the European Union since 2014. In the last years, our team have studied several hydrated borates, each one displaying one (or more) phase transition at high-pressure in the P-range 1.6-17 GPa. These studies suggest a correlation between the H2O content and the pressure at which a hydrated borate undergoes a phase transition, but more studies are needed to confirm a real trend.  The main goals of this project are: i) to assess the high-pressure and the combined high-temperature\/high-pressure stability range of these minerals, ii) to unravel the P-deformation mechanisms of borax and probertite, at the atomic scale iii) to collect high-quality single-crystal data in order to solve the structure of their high-pressure polymorphs. ","4127":"We propose to perform high pressure (HP) \u2013 Room temperature (RT) and low temperature (LT) single crystal diffraction studies on CrSBr, a layered A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor (TN~130K) [i]. We want to determine the pressure evolution of the crystal structure and of the lattice parameters at both RT and LT. We will then use these results to calculate the properties of bulk CrSBr with ab-initio calculations and to corroborate these new findings with our Raman scattering data showing signatures of a phase transition and the appearance of a metallic behaviour. This is extremely important to understand the properties of CrSBr under pressure as this A-type AFM is a direct band gap semiconductor which emission properties are correlated to the magnetic ground state and is foreseen to be used as a pressure\/strain quantum sensor.","4128":"This proposal aims to investigate the Fe\/Ni-Si system under high pressures (HP) to discover new materials for efficient H2 production via water splitting. While room pressure Ni\/Fe silicides have shown remarkable electrocatalytic properties, our intention is to exploit the rich structural diversity of these materials under HP to synthesize novel HP metal silicides of high interest for electrocatalysis. We will firstly search for the HP CsCl-type structures of FeSi and NiSi, and then explore the ternary Fe-Ni-Si system. To do so, we will perform syntheses in molten salts using a Paris-Edinburgh (PE) press. In situ X-Ray diffraction will be crucial to monitor phase reactions and structural transformations induced in molten salts under pressures ranging from 2 to 10 GPa and temperatures from 500\u00b0C to 2000\u00b0C. This endeavor aims to identify intermediates and final products, recoverable due to the large volume press.\r\n\r\n","4129":"The controlled growth of atmospheric snow crystals presently resists the in situ tomographic approach due to several reasons: 1) the difficult temperature and humidity regulation, 2) the rapid phenomena involved, 3) the tiny structure of some crystals, and 4) the practical need of pre-selecting a unique crystal among several growing seeds. These 4 items are major obstacles to access the evolution of such structures in 3D. We found solutions to most of these difficulties and could recently obtain a short series of crystal growth using our cold cell CellDyM3 on BM18 beamline. Based on this preliminary result, we propose to grow at least 2 very distinct types of crystals using CellDyM3 and to monitor their growth using time-lapse tomography. Such an experiment would allow to access a lot of geometrical parameters that cannot be commonly accessed with 2D optical measurements, and to provide reference growth evolutions for the evaluation of 3D ice crystal growth models.","4130":"Our research proposal seeks to delve into the dynamics of quasicrystal (QC) growth, unveiling the fundamental principles that govern their formation. Decagonal\r\n QCs in particular possess an aperiodic plane and a periodic axis perpendicular to this plane. By comparing growth dynamics in aperiodic and periodic directions,\r\n we can place QCs in the same plane of analysis as classical periodic crystals, at least in terms of kinetic properties. Here, we intend to utilize sub-second X-ray\r\n microtomography at beamline ID19 to measure the interfacial dynamics for the solidification of QCs on a timescale that has not been measured yet to the best of\r\n our knowledge.","4131":"Plastics dominate the packaging industry, but more environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging solutions are required. Dry forming of cellulose fibres offers a very attractive solution with much decreased environmental impacts, both in the production and after-use, and from a sustainable source. However, commercial dry-forming is still in its infancy and the actual processes occurring inside the material during forming are not well understood. Consequently, failures can occur in the material during production or use and the current possibilities in terms of the formable shapes are limited. Improved understanding of the mechanics and influence of processing parameters would provide direct input to process optimisation and also support the development of numerical simulation approaches for simulation-driven design. We will investigate dry forming using in-situ x-ray microtomography to explore spatio-temporal microstructure evolution and how these vary with temperature.","4132":"SiC has long been the most widely recognised reinforcement for magnesium matrix composites (MgMC), yet the grain refinement mechanisms of SiC nanowhiskers (SiCnw) are still not fully understood. No direct observations of nanoparticles interacting with Mg dendrites have yet been documented. This study intends to conduct in-situ solidification experiments on MgMC using X-ray tomography at the ID19 beamline, observing the effects of SiCnw (diameter 650 nm, length 5 \u03bcm) on the nucleation and dendritic growth evolution of alpha-Mg grains. Subsequently, solidified samples will be scanned using diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) at the ID11 beamline to study the crystallographic orientation relationships between SiCnw, T2-Al2MgC2 phase and alpha-Mg. The experimental data will also be integrated with numerical simulations of grain growth, offering substantial insights into the study of the grain refining mechanism of SiCnw on Mg.","4133":"PhotoBioModulation aims at illuminating a specific brain region to slow down Parkinson\u2019s Disease. In this context, we investigate the potential of RadioLuminescent (RL) devices based on luminescent materials excited by low-energy beta-emitters. Importantly, radioactivity can be easily confined to get a non-radiotoxic device. We performed RL experiments at CEA Saclay by exposing luminescent materials to a radioactive gas atmosphere. The question of producing the maximum amount of photons is critical. Our strategy is to use a mm-sized cylinder that acts as a reservoir for both beta- and luminescent particles (\u00b5m-sized luminophores or nm-sized Quantum Dots). The interaction between beta- and luminescent particles must be optimized to get the best yield. Quantifying the 3D distribution of luminescent materials in the host matrix and the dopant distribution within luminescent particles is then mandatory and can only be done using synchrotron-based x-ray holo- and fluorescence tomography.","4134":"The aim of this proposal is to investigate at very high temperatures the effect of the used raw materials on the kinetics of in situ reactive sintering of alumina and magnesia to form improved spinel-based and ultra-low cement content refractory ceramics of interest for the steel industry. In particular, we aim to understand the effects of the shape and of the crystallographic nature of the used alumina powder in the reactive process, and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the final material at temperatures up to 1500\u00b0C.","4135":"Carbon capture & storage has been identified as a critical technology for addressing rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Saline aquifers are a promising storage candidate in numerous regions globally for CCS, yet their efficacy can be compromised by CO2-induced salt precipitation Salt can precipitate in different crystal forms with different properties and effects. The morphology and porous structure of salt crystals will depend on several factors e.g. evaporation rate, solute accessibility, characteristics of the solid surface. The proposed experiment aims to understand how salt precipitates on a solid substrate in porous media and how it grows via nucleation\/growth on the same material. Nano\/microporous salt aggregates, crucial to this investigation, have already been synthesized under various conditions as part of the ongoing research of the proposal participants. We expect to obtain a high-resolution 3D tomogram revealing the porous structure at unprecedented spatial resolution.","4136":"Lithium solid-state batteries (SSBs), via the implementation of Li-metal anodes, offer, in theory, a substantial increase in gravimetric energy density compared to Li-ion batteries. While developments are promising, SSBs still suffer from a range of problems. Problems largely originate from a chemo-mechanical degradation at buried interfaces upon cycling. In these continuation experiments (CH-7030), we would like to make use of recently developed capabilities, i.e. the development of a miniaturized sulphide-based SSBs (LiMg\u01c0Li6PS5Cl\u01c0LiMnNiO) compatible with Operando Near-Field Ptychographic X-ray computed NanoTomography (NF-PXCT), to characterize spatially correlated chemo-mechanical degradation processes in SSBs approaching industry targeted composition with nanometre resolution.","4137":"  In industry applications, parts are subjected to overloads leading to void, crack and eventually part replacement. A solution to increase the lifetime of components is to use self-healing materials. These materials have the ability to close their voids and damage with the application of a heat treatment. The healing capacity of AlMgZr alloys manufactured by LPBF will be analysed. The microstructure is composed of an Al3Mg2 eutectic network,  \u03b1-Al dendritic particles and Zr precipitates. To optimise the manufacturing process of new alloys and the healing heat treatment process a phase-field model will be develop to predict the microstructure evolution of the material during the healing heat treatment. To validate the model it is necessary to analyse different samples before and after the healing process. Nanoholotomography allows to analyse the same area before and after the process to track the damage and voids and to evaluate the healing potential of the material.","4138":"Lustre is a metal-glass nanocomposite layer consisting of metallic silver and\/or copper nanoparticles in a glass matrix, located at the outermost surface at a depth between 40 nm and 200 nm and with a thickness from ~ 100 nm to 5 \u00b5m. It was obtained by a process of ionic exchange between the alkali ions of the glass and silver and copper ions from a precursor applied to the glass surface. The concentration and distribution of these nanoparticles, as well as the presence of ionic copper and silver species, contribute to the different optical properties of the lustre layer, such as colour and gloss. The optical properties depend on the materials and the production process (technology) and provide historical information about different production centres. It is essential to analyse cross sections of the decorations by XRF and XANES with submicron resolution to determine the distribution of metallic and ionic species and to establish correlations between them and lustre technology.","4139":"Wet-design subsea power cables, which have their polymeric insulation system exposed to water, are successfully used up to 36.5 kV . However, they are prone to irreversible degradation by water treeing at high voltages. For water trees to grow they need an initiation site, which is normally an impurity at the interface between the semiconductive screens and the insulation. In our latest work we found that water trees can grow from smooth and clean interfaces, where microstructural and chemical defects lie further away from the water tree inception site than ever seen before. Preliminary work on these samples at ID13 by SAXS and WAXS show that these techniques can provide essential information about the impurities and how they are distributed in the observed microstructural features compared to the bulk. The results from these combined studies will give a fundamental understanding of the mechanism for breakdown of the subsea cables and prove our hypothesis. ","4140":"Palygorskite, mixed with indigo, was used in ancient time to produce Maya Blue, a hybrid pigment of unprecedented robustness and longevity. Palygorskite shows a huge structural heterogeneity, arising from the presence of two crystallographic phases of different symmetry, additional impurity phases, cation substitution, and phase intergrowth. Because of these, structural characterisation from powder diffraction data is extremely challenging. The objective of this proposal is to collect single-crystal data on nano-fibers of palygorskite and of Maya Blue reproductions in order to gain better insights into their respective structures.","4141":"Incomplete macromolecular mixing and (re-)entangling across weld interfaces cause inferior weld mechanics transverse to the print direction. As solution we have proposed interfacial stereocomplex (SC) crystallization, but the increased mechanical activation energy of SC-PLA entails mechanical embrittlement. We synthesized new copolymers that upon melt crystallization give enhanced control of ductility via phase separation and interfacial SC crystallization. By combining a nanofocused beam and fast scanning chip calorimeter giving submicron spatial and msec temporal resolution, we aim to answer the question how molecular and blend composition, phase separation in the melt, and cold crystallization during heating in pre-recorded printing profiles direct morphology evolution and later mechanical performance.","4142":"The electro-chemo-mechanical behavior of Al anodes in solid-state batteries is not fully understood, making validation of theoretical models challenging. Especially in solid-state batteries, where substantial uni-axial pressure is needed, Al anodes pose difficulties. This proposal aims to quantify changes in cross-sectional microstructure and stress distributions across Al foils with varying hardness during lithiation and delithiation. Cross-sectional X-ray nanodiffraction will characterize Al and LixAl phases, while wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) data will assess phase evolution, crystalline sizes, texture, and strains during lithiation and delithiation at different stack pressures and cycling rates. This experiment will yield quantitative insights into the kinetics of Li alloy formation and the chemo-mechanical behavior of Li-Al alloys under defined stack pressures and currents, relevant for real-world applications.","4143":"The present research is focused on design of novel materials for applications in water-permeable or pH-responsive micro-membranes. An in-situ study of these materials under controlled humidity will be performed in which we will monitor swelling of PEO and P4VP blocks. Given that P4VP is hydrophilic only at acidic pH values, the selective (pH-variable) block swelling and its impact on adopted morphologies present an important phenomenon to be explored. Water permeability can be adjusted by the design of these materials, depending on the chosen pH value. The study will target understanding the bulk phase-separated morphologies, including the ones where PEO forms crystalline structures, and comparing them to the molten or swollen state of the specific polymer segment. ","4144":"Crystallization by amorphous particle attachment, a non-classical crystal growth mode, is prevalent in minerals formed by living tissues. It is also responsible for the formation of mineral building blocks in various molluscan shell ultrastructures that are stacked together in a hierarchical manner to provide the organisms with the necessary mechanical functionality. Whereas the sub-particulate morphology in molluscan shells was previously well documented, it was never described as having a periodic packing suggesting another hierarchical level in this highly mineralized tissue. We apply to use the SAX\/WAX setup on BM26 to study the nanoparticles packing properties in various ultrastructures in molluscan shells and thus, to provide information on another hierarchical level in these complex biomineralized functional tissues. The premise of this application is supported by high resolution AFM images of various molluscan ultrastructures suggesting a periodic nanoparticle packing.","4145":"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the widespread adoption of electric vehicles remains challenging due to the high charging time of today's batteries. Indeed, increasing the charging rate of Li-ion batteries leads to an increased risk of lithium plating: a parasitic reaction that affects the safety and durability of the battery. It is therefore essential to develop a real-time Li plating detection technique compatible with industrial applications i.e., a reference electrode (RE). However, inserting an additional electrode in a conventional battery is not neutral as it could interfere with the other electrodes leading to faster failure. We propose here to perform X-ray diffraction at several locations in a pouch-cell i) close to the reference electrode as well as far away from the RE to see the impact of the RE on the electrochemical lithiation\/delithiation processes and ii) to probe the electrochemical activities of the RE.","4146":"The goal of this proposal is twofold. On the one hand it aims at improving the previously developed setup allowing simultaneous WAXS\/XPCS measurements besides by adding a SAXS detector in order to track the structural evolution at the nanometer scale. On the other hand, the goal is to consolidate the previously carried out measurements and to go deeper in order to answer the remaining questions. In this way, one aim is to determine if the slowdown of the relaxation times observed with the increase of crystallinity arises from a constraining effect due to the formation of crystalline lamellae and\/or originates from an increase of nanoparticles concentration (i.e. tracers) into the amorphous domains involved by a segregation effect. Also, more precise and exhaustive measurements will be carried out on stretched samples in order to confirm the fact the dynamics heterogeneities and to determine the critical orientation degree above which they are observed.","4147":"CsPbI3 exhibits remarkable performance in photovoltaic cells, yet maintaining phase stability under ambient conditions remains a primary challenge. To tackle this, we enhance phase stability through Bi-doping. The ionic and soft nature of the perovskite structure induces crystal lattice polarization and distortion around an injected charge carrier, forming a polaron quasiparticle. Polarons in perovskite solar cells significantly impact charge transport and recombination dynamics, influencing overall device performance. Researchers aim to optimize polaron dynamics, striking a balance between charge transport and recombination to enhance efficiency. Employing appropriate techniques is crucial to correlate structural distortion and polaron state. Our objective is to identify structural changes in illuminated Bi-doped CsPbI3, revealing varying solar cell efficiency based on Bi concentrations, and establish the relationship among Bi concentration, structural distortion, and polaron state.","4148":"Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) have shown great potential to be used for material renewal in harsh environment industries and applications in space, accelerator physics and nuclear energy due to the superior stability and toughness at high temperature that surpass Ni-based super alloy. However, the radiation resistance underpinning mechanism is still an open question and requires a detailed understanding of the atomic-scale interstitial-defect-lattice interactions. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies are currently underway to understand and harness the role played by structural short range ordering to VNbMoTaW RHEA. In particular, state-of-the-art atomistic simulations predicted element specific local ordering and this proposal aims to confirm through EXAFS characterisation its existence and behaviour as a function of heavy self-ion irradiation fluence in the random system.","4149":"We propose to perform in-situ EXAFS in CrCoNi alloy during compression in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) to reveal local chemical ordering. We hypothesize that, under GPa pressures, the massively induced dislocations and slip bands will cause a directional version of chemical redistribution. Specifically, rapid Ni diffusion could enable its segregation and ordering along the shear band, in which the deformation strain is highly concentrated. As EXAFS measures the pair distribution function (PDF) with elemental specificity, we will measure if the applied pressure creates anisotropy in the PDF reminiscent of solute segregation along slip bands. By integrating the measured PDFs with our molecular dynamics simulations under analogous conditions, we will explore how different types of slip systems could cause the pressure-dependent segregation. Our study will enhance current knowledge of how solute segregation and local chemical order govern the mechanism of pressure-induced plasticity.","4150":"Based on prior knowledge regarding the interaction of N2O\/O2 and CH4 with Fe in Fe-SSZ-13, this proposal aims to use an operando multi-spectroscopy approach including RIXS, KBeta-HERFD-XAS, and KBeta,alfa-XES to elucidate the temperature-dependent reaction mechanism of CH4 hydroxylation to CH3OH and to isolate the atomic-scale reactivity of active Fe centres. This includes monitoring the Fe oxidation state, the structure of intermediates (Fe-O), spin dynamics, and preferential ligation as a function of reaction conditions. ","4151":"To store sustainable energy in the form of hydrogen, the efficiency of water electrolysis must be improved. Specifically, the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) must be reduced while high stability of the catalyst must be maintained. Perovskite oxides (ABO3) are considered promising earth-abundant catalysts for the OER in alkaline media. However, an inverse relationship between activity and stability seems to exist. We propose the use of subsurface engineering to enhance the activity of LaCoO3 layers without doping of soluble elements to overcome the activity-stability trade-off. When using LaNiO3 as a subsurface, a complex interplay between Ni and Co results in high OER activities. We propose the use of HERFD XAS to study this interplay in an operando experiment during the OER.","4152":"For commercialization of proton-exchange fuel cells as green technology for automotive propulsion, it is important to replace the platinum-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, that is considered as critical raw material, rare and expensive. FeNC catalysts are inexpensive substitutes but degrade during long-term operation. Part of the degradation is associated with the leaching of iron ions and related to it a Fenton\u2019s reaction that can lead to severe degradation. Over the past couple of years, we developed a purified FeNC catalyst that outperforms our previous catalyst both in activity and stability. By operando synchrotron based M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy (SMS) coupled with a FC, we would like to comparatively investigate both catalysts with respect to their structural changes during fuel cell operation by changing the voltage. The data will enable us to identify differences in both systems, as well as to determine degradation kinetics at different relevant cell voltages.","4153":"In this experiment we will study operando the edges of the all the elements within LiNiO2 high-capacity cathode material for Li-ion batteries: O L-, Li K- and Ni\r\nM2,3-edges. To be able to access the Li K-edge XRS operando, we will use DRIX electrochemical cells with a higher signal purity. To further explore the potential\r\nwealth of information that could be extracted from the Li K-edge on battery materials, the solvation environments of Li polymer electrolytes, where Li is present in\r\ndifferent coordination environments will be investigated ex-situ.","4154":"The adoption of electrolyser technology for hydrogen production by water splitting is hampered by the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The recently identified Lattice Oxygen Mediated (LOM) mechanism for OER offers a promising route to significantly improve the efficiency of water splitting. O K-edge and transition metal (TM) L-edges provide a direct probe of TM-O hybridization that could reveal the underlying mechanism of LOM OER. However, the short attenuation length of soft X-rays, precludes realistic operando studies with soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This proposal aims to use X-ray Raman Scattering (XRS) as a hard X-ray probe of shallow core levels to enable operando measurements of the TM and O redox processes occurring under OER conditions. This will provide new understanding of the LOM mechanism of O2 evolution under high overpotential conditions to inform the rational design of improved electrocatalysts","4155":"Post-weld treatments can enhance the lifetime of welded structures and thereby contribute to long-lasting use of constructions and an impact toward sustainability in civil engineering. Our project team developed a post-weld treatment, where a nano metallic multilayer (NMM) is applied on the weld bead, heat affected zone (HAZ) and weld proximity. During electrodeposition of the thin film, tensile residual stresses develop, which in turn induce compressive residual stresses in the surface of the steel. The induced compressive residual stress states are expected to govern the improvement of fatigue behaviour in NMM treated specimen. Understanding the development of the residual stress states in the coating, dependent of the process parameters during electrodeposition and layer characteristics, yields toward optimization of the NMM as a post-weld treatment and enables tailoring of such behaviour.","4156":"X-ray reflectivity (XRR) nowadays is limited to model surfaces employing mm-sized samples. The extent of real surfaces in applications (e.g.,\nLi-ion batteries), which need improved fundamental understanding, however, is several hundreds of nm to tens of \u00b5m. Towards this end, we demonstrated the feasibility of XRR in \u00b5m -sized model samples employing the nm-sized X-ray beams uniquely available at ID01 of ESRF-EBS. As a next step, we propose to extend our study to samples closer to application, namely spin-coated Al2O3 platelets coated with Au\/Ti as a well-known system with clear Kiessig fringes to simulate the distribution of crystallites in electrodes, and real NMC electrode crystallites spin coated in a similar way. This will help to ultimately use nm-beam XRR for in situ experiments utilizing the high-intensity nm-beams at ESRF-EBS. ","4157":"Improvement of catalytic activity and durability are key steps towards a widespread commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. These are highly dependent on the surface structure of the nanocatalysts. Using Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), a state-of-the-art single crystal X-ray characterization technique, we aim at reconstructing the 3D strain fields of Pt nanoparticles (NP) under electrochemical control (in situ). Based on a novel sample preparation technique, we are confident that we will be able to assess the full range of structural changes occurring on the surface of the catalyst in the presence of oxygenated intermediates (oxygen reduction reaction and degradation processes such as place exchange mechanism) and to provide a holistic understanding of the surface strain evolution on the nanoscale during the real-world operation of fuel cells. ","4158":"The aim of this experiment is to investigate twinning in magnesium alloys using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) and topotomography during mechanical loading. At one-third the weight of aluminum, magnesium (Mg) alloys hold significant promise for reducing the emissions of automobiles and aircrafts via lightweighting. Mg will both plastically slip and twin in response to a mechanical load. In a past DFXM experiment, we characterized twinning in Mg-4Al with in-situ DFXM using a miniature loading stage. We observed the accumulation of dislocations (the precursor to cracking) at twin-grain and twin-twin junctions. We also demonstrated that it is possible to characterize twin growth in 3D (the first experimental observation of its kind) using these methods, but we were only able to characterize three load steps. Here, we aim to characterize the sequential growth of deformation twins in 3D using a new approach that include motor-actuated loading, and combining DFXM with topotomography.","4159":"Dislocations (line defects) in functional ceramics are generating rapid research interest for both functional and mechanical properties. Despite of recent years\u2019 development for dislocation engineering into various oxides, a major challenge remains: crack initiation and propagation even in dislocation-rich regions can occur unexpectedly and lead to fracture of the samples. To overcome this challenge and better understand dislocation-crack tip interaction in oxides, here we propose to use SrTiO3 as a model system to use DFXM (dark-field X-ray microscopy) for imaging dislocations around cracks. DFXM will provide critical 3D information at micro\/mesoscale with high resolution (~100 nm). Our preliminary DFXM test on SrTiO3 suggests this is a promising route. Samples with 4 different dislocation densities at pre-induced cracks will be probed. The spatial distribution of dislocations and their strain fields will be measured to feed our developed dislocation-based fracture mechanics model.","4160":"The wide bandgap semiconductor material Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an attractive proposition to replace Silicon (Si) for the development of efficient, robust power electronic devices. However, whilst the material is high quality and single crystal, it is 20-30 years behind development when compared to Si maturity and is still riddled with defects which give rise to sources of failure and inefficiency. Recently, trench refill epitaxy (TFE) has been developed at Warwick, where semiconductor processing techniques have been used to create microstructures in SiC and refilled with single crystal SiC to create exotic structures termed superjunctions (SJs). However, these structures also lend themselves to terminating and annihilation of defects. We would like to work with the Scientists at ID03 to perform a preliminary study of stress and strain in these microstructures and their defects to correlate these with growth mechanisms and device characteristics from the resulting materials.","4161":"Bio-cementation of sand, also known as MICP (Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation), is a rather novel soil-reinforcement process that uses bacterial activity to cement loose cohesionless sand. It leads to the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as calcite crystals on the surface of the particles, that act as \u2018bridges\u2019 between them. This process has been industrialised and is now being used for engineering purposes. The aim of this work is to study the growth of these bio-minerals in the medium using scanning 3D X-ray diffraction with time, by also varying different parameters that are known to affect the cementation process.","4162":"The goal of this research is to obtain direct evidence related to the initial grain microstructure and the development of local strain (notably strain concentration) in particle-containing Al alloys through the application of non-destructive synchrotron radiation techniques. This proposal proposes a novel, multiscale, and multimodal strategy by combining these sophisticated methodologies, an endeavor yet to be pursued in this field. Specifically, we aim to measure local strains by analyzing the 3D displacement of second phase particles observed through absorption micro-tomography (micro-CT) during tensile tests. Our novel method for microstructural features tracking will be utilized in detailed 3D strain mapping analysis. Furthermore, 3D grain microstructures before and during tensile deformation will be characterized using diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) and scanning 3DXRD (s-3DXRD) developed at the ESRF.","4163":"Solid Oxide Cells (SOC) devices are featured by reversibility since they can work in both SOFC (F=Fuel) and SOEC (E=Electrolysis) mode. Current electrolyte materials suffer of particles agglomeration and C poisoning reducing lifetime and performance. Very recently, advanced electrocatalysts, were metal nanoparticles are produced by exsolution, are overcoming these drawbacks. Much experimental work is mandatory to characterize the materials and device under SOFC and SOC conditions\r\nHereby we propose to investigate the structural evolutions of a electrolytic cell working in both SOFC and SOEC conditions though in-situ experiments. Modifications will be detected by XRD measurements as function of the temperature, external atmosphere, time and cyclability. The approach involves the comparison with the separate materials (electrode and electrolyte, pellets) subjected to the same treatment to point out the difference and interaction between electrode and electrolyte materials.\r\n","4164":"We propose a PDF\/pXRD beamtime in which we want to investigate the role oxygen vacancy formation has on the exsolution of metallic nanoparticles (= migrating parts of the material to the surface, without destruction of the host, thus enhancing catalytic activity) in perovskite-oxides, a material used in heterogeneous catalysis and solid oxide fuel cells. By varying the A-site element of the material, we can tune oxygen vacancy formation which will be investigated by PDF. The pXRD measurements will allow us to characterise exsolution kinetics. These two experiments will give valuable insight into the material's properties and facilitate an intelligent design approach for novel catalysts and energy materials","4165":"Implementation of carbon capture technology such as direct air capture (DAC) is highly needed for EU's climate neutral target. The crystalline porous solids, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have demonstrated excel potential for DAC. We recently developed a layered copper-based MOF with a crystal structure that features alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic channels. Our recent simulations on this MOF indicate a unique channel-selective adsorption mechanism of CO2\/H2O, where CO2 molecules occupy the water-free hydrophobic channel at high humidity. To evaluate its potential for DAC, it is highly worthy of carrying out in situ adsorption breakthrough experiment coupled with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to understand the binding behavior of competing components in DAC. This information provides direct visualization of the host-guest interactions, and in combination with complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculation can inform the energy profile of adsorption.","4166":"Hybrid perovskite glasses are a new class of non-crystalline materials formed by melt-quenching crystalline two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (2D-HOIPs). These materials have the potential for next-generation applications such as optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and sensing, however, they are unstable, and reverting to their crystalline phase over time or with mild heating. Preliminary research shows that liquid-phase blending can stabilize these glasses, creating binary HOIP glasses. Here, we propose using synchrotron-based methods to fully characterize the structure of these blends. By employing high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) and total scattering measurements to acquire pair distribution functions (PDFs), we will study both the crystalline and glassy forms at various temperatures. This research aims to provide insights into the structural changes during glass formation and their effect on thermal stability and optical properties.","4167":"Aluminum phosphonate-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are particularly promising materials due to their chemical stability and tunable properties, making them ideal for industrial gas adsorption and separation. However, the structural dynamics of these MOFs, especially in relation to their pore content (adsorption\/hydration), are not well understood. This study proposes to investigate the structural flexibility of a new aluminum phosphonate MOF, CAU-67, focusing on how hydration affects its crystal structure and phase transitions. Preliminary in-situ PXRD measurements have shown a direct link between the temperature and therefor the water content in the pores and flexibility, indicating (reversible) phase changes. To deepen our understanding, high-resolution in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments under different atmospheric conditions, including controlled water vapor dosing, will provide crucial insights into the breathing effects in phosphonate MOFs.","4168":"Oxygen redox in oxide cathodes for Li-ion batteries allows for higher energy densities, but its mechanisms are still debated due to challenges in identifying the oxidized oxygen species. Recent studies claim that oxygen redox involves \"trapped\" molecular O2 in nanovoids (M\u2014O-O species) based on high-resolution RIXS investigations. However, our latest RIXS experiments at ESRF demonstrate that molecular O2 signals indeed appear in both O-redox active and inactive cathodes, thereby challenging this view. Further theoretical investigations suggest that the RIXS signatures do not indicate M\u2014O-O species, i.e., the predicted electrochemical products, but rather resemble free O2 molecules likely dissociated from M\u2014O-O species due to the core excitation process in RIXS. To prove this striking finding, we propose performing operando RIXS to observe the evolution of molecular O2 during electrochemical cycling, which is believed to be the key to unveiling the real origin of molecular O2.","4169":"The introduction of further transition metals (TMs) such as Cr, Mn and Ti, into the Na superionic conductor Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) used as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), can boost its specific capacity, increasing the specific energy at the full-cell level. Nonetheless, the mechanistic interplay of the dopants in NVP remains unclear. Our objective is to unveil the multi-electron reactions of TM (co-)doped NVP cathode materials, focusing on the impact of Cr, and the synergic interactions of Mn and Ti, which have so far rarely been fully investigated. Ex situ and operando XANES spectra are crucial for elucidating the evolution of oxidation states and the bonding state of the dopant species. EXAFS data will complement the findings by disclosing the evolution of the local structural environment of the TMs. The results are expected to attract significant attention and develop guidelines on the impact of the dopants in this class of cathodes for high-performance SIBs.","4170":"The oxidation of UO2, is of major concern to the nuclear industry. As UO2 is oxidised to U4O9 and U3O8, either during burn-up or long-term storage, the physical and chemical properties of the fuel are altered, reducing their economic and safety performance. Our previous experiment at ID11 (MA4980) provided the first x-ray diffraction measurements of a single crystal U4O9 and U3O7, giving new insight into their structure, and showed that there are subtle structural changes within each phase, and potentially with varying stoichiometry and therefore uranium valence state. In this proposal, we aim to understand the  uranium valence states present as stoichiometric epitaxial UO2 thin film single crystals (001) and (111), are oxidised. Using the unique capabilities available at ROBL, we can systematically correlate structural and chemical changes through the use of in-situ x-ray diffraction and x-ray spectroscopy, giving unparalleled insight into the evolution of valence states.","4171":"In the race towards CO2 emission reduction, its conversion to methanol is of great interest due to the latter market potential as valuable chemical. Oxide-supported metal catalysts have been widely applied in methanol synthesis and extensively studied for decades. To improve control over the dispersion of catalytic active sites, we have developed a strategy involving thermal decomposition of metal-supported Ce\/Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to prepare In2O3 catalyst supported on different CeO2-ZrO2 solid solutions. We here propose to combine quasi-simultaneous XAS\/PXRD measurements under reaction relevant conditions (10 bar of CO2:H2 (1:3), 573K) at BM23 to disclose the activation\/deactivation mechanisms related to In and Ce reduction and particles agglomeration. Moreover, to track active and transient active species kinetics, we will apply Modulated Excitation of reactants on isolated XAS and PXRD experiments which we successfully already employed previously.","4172":"We developed a \u201cone pot\u201d synthesis to anchor Cu ions onto nano-MOFs 808 (Zr). We prepared a set of catalysts with different Cu-loading and chemical interaction with the Zr6 nodes, preserving the structure of MOF 808 (Zr). The performance of MOF-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 to C1 products highlights how effective MOFs architecture can be in achieving precise control over the chemical environment of the active site and thus the catalytic pathways. From our laboratory tests on Cu MOF-808 (Zr) at different Cu contents, we observed a significant Cu loading-dependent change in product selectivity. To rationalize the experimental findings and relate them to atomic-scale changes in Cu location and oxidation state in the metal organic structure, while checking the stability of the MOF scaffold, we propose to apply quasi-simultaneous XAS\/PXRD to Cu-MOF 808 (Zr) catalysts with different copper amount under operando conditions during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.","4173":"Tendons have an extraordinary ability to withstand loads due to their unique multi-scale complex hierarchical organization, where the collagen molecule is the basic building block. Collagen is arranged in different structural units (fibrils and fibers and fascicles) up to the organ level, which are known to stretch, slide and move relative to each other during loading. What is still not known is how the structure of the tendon emerges and develops from birth to adulthood. In this proposal, we would like to use phase contrast tomography to image tendons from the goat ranging from neonates to adult, to unravel how the different sub-units, e.g. fascicles, develop, and how the collagen fiber distribution emerges.  We need to use a large animal model, as smaller animals do not have all the same structural units as humans, and this can affect the interpretation of the results. Therefore, we are applying to BM18. ","4174":"Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysers have the potential to lower hydrogen production costs, but their poor durability holds them back from commercialisation. Catalyst detachment from the AEM is one of the main causes of the poor durability and is the result of poorly understood ionomer degradation. Catalyst detachment is a process only observable in-situ and is impossible to distinguish from other degradation processes by electrochemical measurements alone. This proposed experiment will observe, for the first time, how catalyst adhesion is impacted by the choice of electrolyser feed solution using operando X-ray microtomography (\u03bc-CT) at ID19. Fast \u03bc-CT scans will enable correlation of the observable changes in the cell with changes in voltage and resistance. Understanding how the feed solution affects the catalyst layer will aid in the development of more durable AEM electrolysers.","4175":"During early stages of deformation, many metals exhibit signs of plastic strain localization in the form of slip bands, which can be observed at the sample surface. These bands carry high shear amplitudes and give rise to highly heterogeneous stress-strain distributions which may ultimately lead to nucleation of material damage. We propose to carry out comprehensive 4D characterization of plastic strain localization in the bulk of Ni based superalloy using a combination of high resolution tomographic  X-ray imaging techniques, including (holo)-nanotomography at ID16A and different variants of X-ray (Bragg) diffraction imaging at ID11. The sub-surface spatial arrangement and kinematics of slip band formation will be derived from (heavyside) Digital Volume Correlation, applied to the dispersion of (sub-micron) precipitates present in the microstructure. The combination with 3D crystal orientation and strain mapping techniques will allow for detailed analysis of strain localization in 4D.","4176":"This project aims at characterizing the nucleation of pores during heat treatment of 2050 and clarify the origin of this nucleation.

Such dynamic optical properties in the hydrogel are caused by the micromorphology change in the range of 10\u2013300 nm, which can hardly be monitored by the in-house SAXS instrument due to the limitation of spatial and temporal resolution.

Oxygen-deficient WO3-x exhibits high electrical conductivity, concurrently it displays enhanced optical absorption within the visible-to-NIR energy range, which poses challenges for optimal applications. We aim to verify the hypothesis that this enhanced optical absorption arises from d-d excitations within the W 5d states, facilitated by the increased nominal electronic configurations of 5d1 and 5d2 as a result of self-doping. Once our research results verify the hypothesis, they will yield a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the enhanced optical absorption, thereby providing insights to mitigate this effect, and contributing to advance the utilization of WO3-x as transparent electric contacts.","4183":"","4184":"","4185":"","4186":"","4187":"","4189":"","4190":"","4191":"","4192":"","4196":"Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by deposition of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in brain tissues.

We focus on repair and reconstruction of injured nerves to investigate interaction between spatial outgrowth of axons and its environment, particularly presence and formation of blood vessels. We assemble experimental rat models, including a diabetic rat model, in which nerves are repaired and reconstructed using novel strategies, such as application of silk threads between severed nerve ends. The peripheral nerves will be investigated using applied synchrotron imaging and quantitative image analysis.

","4205":"The release of metals from arthroplasty implants can clinically manifest in aseptic osteolysis. In a recent synchrotron-XRF study performed at the ESRF, we found that Co and Cr released from arthroplasty implants integrate into peri-implant bone. However, it remains elusive whether metal integration into bone directly alters bone tissue homeostasis. Osteocytes are located in the lacunar network of the bone and are major regulators of bone tissue homeostasis. Thus, the proposed project aims to perform nanoCT analyses of human ex vivo specimens to systematically investigate the influence of metal exposure on osteocyte lacunae and the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network. Nano-resolution and a high sample throughput are mandatory to better understand the role of the osteocyte-network in the disturbed mineral homeostasis.

In an abnormal phosphorylated state TDP-43 has been linked to the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) is involved in several cellular processes: it is an enzyme accelerating protein folding and also it is a molecular chaperone protecting against oxidative stress and protein misfolding. PPIA is an interacting partner of TDP-43: lack of this interaction induces TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, leading to neurodegeneration.We want to elucidate whether PPIA acts as a chaperone, sequestrating TDP-43 in a one to one complex, or it acts as a foldase, realising the TDP-43 substrate after the folding rearrangement. To address this issue we synthetized three different TDP-43 peptides, belonging to the region that regulates aggregation and inter-protein bonds. We plan to observe the interaction of the peptides with PPIA and how their interplay modifies the kinetics of peptides aggregation.\r\n","4208":"In this experiment, we aim at using X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT (XPCI-CT) for post-mortem imaging of healthy and glioblastoma-bearing brains after in-vivo treatment with synchrotron generated X-ray standard broad beams or Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT).

This complicates treatment and results in a substantial cost for the health system. Despite several hypotheses, aetiological factors remain unknown. We aim to visualize the fine enamel microstructure and quantify the timing and pattern of stress events recorded in MIH teeth. Only phase contrast synchrotron micro-CT at ID19 enables high energy low dose imaging with a large field of view of tooth microstructure.

The goals of this study are:\r\n1. to characterize GBM morphology by using high-resolution X-PCI-CT virtual histology and three-dimensionally (3D) visualize information that are not accessible with histopathology;\r\n2. to correlate morphologic information unique to X-PCI-CT (e.g. 3D microvasculature and 3D cell stratification) with parameters from non-invasive imaging, histopathology and molecular genetics;\r\n3. to study the predictive value of X-PCI-CT parameters on disease classification and progression.\r\nResults of this study could tremendously affect diagnosis and therapy of GBM.","4230":"When it comes to human tissues, the sub-\u00b5m length scale plays a fundamental role in understanding tissue changes, whether it is caused by tumours or other organ-specific pathologies. This proposal aims at performing X-ray speckle-based tomography on samples like ovarian, endometrial, and liver tissues for a deeper understanding of the local changes in the microstructures resulting from a specific pathology (endometriosis, steatosis), a neoplastic transformation, or a cryopreservation procedure (vitrification). To that end, X-ray speckle-based imaging (SBI) has recently shown high potential, thanks to its high sensitivity to small density differences in unstained soft tissues. Unlike other techniques, SBI also provides additional information about small-angle scattering, known as dark-field. With the dark-field signal, it is possible both to improve the visualisation of sub-resolution microstructure alterations and to quantitatively detect the orientation of anisotropic structures.\r\n","4231":"One in 9 men will suffer from prostate cancer (PC) during his lifetime and 20% of them will face advanced metastatic disease. Bone metastases (BM) occur in ~80% of advanced PC patients causing severe pain and fractures that can generate spinal cord compression and immobility. Although PCBMs generate osteoblastic lesions with increased bone density, they still make bone weaker and easier to fracture. Our preliminary observations showed more and larger lacunae and altered canaliculi in PCBM, and lack of collagen organization. Here, we propose to use the X-ray phase-contrast nano-CT setup at the beam-line to analyze PCBM lacunar-canalicular network as a factor in understanding PCBM fragility. This beam-line, with the best available resolution and experience in 3D bone imaging, would help understanding lacunar-canalicular structure in PCBM, which can be related to stress accumulation and fractures, and provide insights on the intercellular communications in PCBM.","4232":"This proposal is a continuation of a recent experiment performed on the ID16A Beamline to investigate the intracellular concentration and subcellular localization of antibiotics into Gram-negative bacteria. It is based on using cryo X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging approaches to localize and quantify antibiotic-metal complexes as novel antibacterial probes in Escherichia coli at nanoscale resolution. The obtained data will provide unique quantitative 3D of antibacterial drugs in single bacterial and an invaluable proof of concept for the development of new antibacterial drugs.","4233":"Zinc is a natural trace-element in the natural biocomposite dentine that makes up the bony part of teeth. It can additionally diffuse out of artificially placed filling materials, as occasionally reported for clinically-used Zn containing biomaterials (e.g. root canal gutta-percha). Diffusion is extensive with high concentrations that can percolate many hundreds of \u00b5m across the bulk of the tooth, as we recently showed. This diffusion causes changes in the micro-structure and chemistry of dentine which have to be understood to determine benefits or possible slow degradation to healthy dentine. Filling materials typically contain ZnO while natural Zn can either be incorporated in the apatite crystals or reside in MMPs in the organic component, which we investigate by XANES. We propose to map the chemical state of Zn to elucidate relationships between resident and diffusion species in healthy dentine near filling material.  ","4234":"Polymeric nanogels (NGs) have gained increasing interest as smart nanomaterials for drug delivery purposes. However, some aspects on the effective conformational structure and organization of their building blocks, and their behavior at the submicron scale within the biological compartments are not fully detailed yet. This limits the use of NGs in clinical scenarios. We proposed the formulation of hyaluronic acid-polyethylenimine (HA-PEI) NGs for CD44-targeting therapy in ovarian cancer.  The aim of the proposal is a deep structural investigation of HA-PEI NGs by SAXS\/WAXS techniques as a function of synthesis methods, drug loading, and environmental conditions. The stability\/degradation trend and the interaction with lipid model membranes will also be addressed, helping the optimization of the design and engineering of these materials for biomedical applications.","4235":"Patients with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of sustaining a hip fracture despite having normal or even increased bone mass. Bone is resorbed and formed continuously in a process that is regulated by several hormones and cells, including osteocytes, which are embedded in the bone tissue. Our preliminary data shows that microvascular disease, a well-known type 2 diabetes-related complication, is associated with enlarged osteocyte lacunae. We hypothesise that the bone matrix surrounding the enlarged osteocyte lacunae differs in mineral and collagen composition compared to bone matrix surrounding the smaller osteocyte lacunae from patients without microvascular diseases. We aim to test the hypothesis by high resolution scanning of thin bone slices from adult patients with type 2 diabetes with or without microvascular disease. ","4236":"This HOAHub will create a physical and virtual Hub which uses HiP-CT to scan whole human organs with local cellular resolution, producing a \u201cHuman Organ Atlas in Health and Disease\u201d. It will bridge clinical imaging (centimetre scale) to molecular modalities (nanometer scale), providing unprecedented insights into our bodies, helping cure or mitigate diseases from neuro-degeneration to cancer. The HOAHub will bring together interdisciplinary groups to produce the novel experimental and computational technologies needed to analyse and interpret the scale-bridging data. By transforming HiP-CT into an efficient tool, HOAHub will enable the clinical impact of synchrotron imaging to be realised. Through these scientific and technical efficiencies, HOAHub will not only advance biological, computational and medical fields, it will provide anatomical training resources and a new Gold Standard for validating CT, MRI and 3D histology, inspiring new techniques and real-world clinical insights.","4237":"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is responsible for chewing movements, sound articulation, facial expression, and facial symmetry. Therefore, dysfunction in this joint leads to issues in food intake, aesthetics, and communication besides causing high levels of pain in the individual. The few treatments available for TMJ disorders comprise the administration of intra-articular injections, which can result in TMJ degeneration and the need for a joint replacement using commercially available faulty prostheses. The present work aims to characterize the intricate anatomic structure of human TMJs by using hierarchical phase-contrast tomography. Data collection will be essential to our Horizon 2020 project (http:\/\/www.interlynk-h2020.eu\/) which targets creating scaffolds for improving TMJ replacements. The collected images will be used to enable the creation of bio-inspired, more efficient TMJ replacements in the future. ","4238":"X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography (XPCT) recently emerged as a highly relevant imaging modality in preclinical neuroscience thanks to the exquisite contrast it allows for both white matter tracts and blood vessels. Imaging full brains is of major importance as neurological diseases are most often not restricted to delimited areas of infarction but affect neuronal or vascular networks well beyond from lesion cores. Until recently, the size of the field of view permitted by XPCT facilities only allowed the imaging of rodent brains. The recent development of Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) protocols on the ESRF beamlines BM05\/BM18 enables to image intact monkey brains. We plan to perform a high-resolution 3D tractography of the white matter and segmentation of blood vessel architecture at the scale of the whole brain. Brains from animals responding differently to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for studying multiple sclerosis, will be compared. ","4239":"The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which protects the central nervous system from mechanical insult, and is instrumentally involved in the supply of nutrients and the removal of metabolic waste. The choroid plexus is a secretory tissue attached to the walls of the brain ventricles, it serves as a tunable barrier to immune cells and is the primary site of CSF production. Several neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders are associated with changes in CSF homeostasis and disruption of the choroid plexus\u2019 blood-CSF barrier function.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we propose to image the anatomical changes of the choroid plexus in mouse disease models of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We will quantify the morphological changes and publish numerical data on key functional parameters such as surface area, volume, epithelial thickness, and vascularization, and analyze their impact on the transport of immune cells or clearance of plaque precursors.","4240":"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by personality changes and executive dysfunctions, could be associated with disease-specific anatomical alterations. FTD remains difficult to diagnose and may be confused with psychiatric disorders or other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\r\nHere, we propose to study the P301S mouse model of FTD to detect structural and morphological alterations at brain level at different time points, to identify specific hallmarks that can differentiate FTD from other neurodegenerative dementias. In addition, since there is evidence that gut pathological conditions are present in several diseases affecting the central nervous system, we intend to investigate the gut of the same animals, to find out whether this anatomical region is similarly involved in FTD. The finding of a link between gut dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders could have an important impact on developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","4241":"The bioartificial pancreas MailPan\u00ae aims at restoring insulin supply for diabetic patient. It hosts insulin secreting cells that have to survive and deliver insulin. While the mechanical resistance once implanted was validated through experiments at ESRF in 2014 (PhD, paper online), the inner of the device still needs optimization. To extend cell survival, a structured 3D environment was brought in the device. In order to understand what is happening inside, how the cells are evolving, the repartition of insulin secreting cells at different time (D0, D5, D14, D30) must be studied. However, the opacity of the device prevents to use classical microscopy. It is thus crucial to carry out such X-ray microtomography experiments at the ESRF, with high energy and flux to pass through, as well has high resolution but to detect all the constitutive elements. The results will clearly demonstrate if the MailPan\u00ae\u2019s 3D environment is beneficial and will influence the final design.","4242":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), i.e. high blood pressure in the lung, is a lethal condition. Novel therapies have shown promising pressure-lowering results, but their exact effects are unknown. In particular, one of the new drugs has been observed to induce symptoms similar to the ones of a genetic \r\ndisorder, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Patients with HHT can develop larger connections (shunts) between arteries and veins in the lung. If the same happens in PAH patients treated with the drugs, intrapulmonary shunts could explain the pressure-lowering effect; however, they might also dangerously lower the oxygen level if they become significant. Our goal is to map the microscopic 3D effects of two novel PAH therapies (in rat models), and to compare their effects with the vascular changes seen in human HHT and mouse models of HHT. Our results will lead to a better understanding of these novel PAH drugs, which is of great importance for the safety of patients.","4243":"Prostate carcinoma is the most common cancer in men and, along with bronchial carcinoma, one of the best-studied malignancies. However, the unique Gleason grading system has been extensively revised but still constitutes the basis for the WHO-ISUP and serves as a predictive marker established worldwide. Depending on the degree of differentiation, different therapeutic strategies are applied. But the unique clinical and molecular heterogeneity of prostate cancer remains largely unconsidered. However, based on this scoring, no correlation to an overall survival rate can be established to date. This suggests that the two-dimensional examination based on thin slide sections used so far has hidden certain information about the specific carcinoma. These structural features require a resolution of well below 1 \u00b5m, and in combination with the excellent soft-tissue contrast, the X-ray nano-holotomography (XNH) setup at the ID16A-beamline is ideally suited for our research case.","4244":"Cisplatin ototoxicity (CO) contributes to ~0.5 million hearing impairment cases among cancer patients globally each year. The lack of understanding of cisplatin distribution in the cochlea and the mechanism of CO hinders the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Recently, our group reported a promising candidate, honokiol, for treating CO during chemotherapy. Whether honokiol works through affecting cisplatin distribution is neither clear. 2D sections of cochleas can provide some clues on Pt distributions, however, we need a comprehensive understanding on the three-dimensional (3D) cisplatin distributions within the cochlea internal network.Therefore, we want to perform correlative holographic nanotomography and 3D XRF scanning on vitrified cochleas for precise and comprehensive observation on Pt targeted subcellular compartments. This research will provide crucial insights for understanding the mechanism of CO and the protective effect of honokiol. ","4245":"In oncological head and neck surgery, microvascular free fibula flaps have become the gold standard in bony reconstruction, especially for the mandible. Still, contradictory data on the ossification in the gap region between the local bone (Alveolar bone = AB) and the transplanted bone (Fibula bone = FB) exists. Besides individual parameters like patient anatomy, mechanical integrity, and the postoperative load, the role of the bone 3D osteocyte network (OCN) topology at the AB-FB interface have not been examined yet. Since the OCN plays a fundamental role in cell\u2013cell contact, nutrition, signaling, and even in bone remodeling, we plan to examine the OCN topology in and adjacent to the gap region with nanoCT on ID16B. These results will help visualize the inter-connections of newly formed bone tissue, and help understand to what extent the integration of the transplanted bone occurs via the OCN as opposed to the blood vessel system through osteoblast\/osteoclast activity. ","4247":"The project aims at studying the potential therapeutic effects of Idebenone and the mGlu1 receptor antagonist JNJ16259685 in an experimental model of glaucoma by using a high-sensitivity microscopic approach based on X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT (X-PCI-CT) for multiscale, post-mortem 3D virtual-histology. Neuroprotection is demanded in eye disorders such as glaucoma, where death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and neurodegeneration along the nuclei of the visual pathway take place through different mechanisms. Mitochondria are involved in cellular processes ranging from metabolic functions to calcium homeostasis and the regulation of cell death. Activation of mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptors has an important role in excitotoxic degeneration of RGCs. Targeting mitochondria and mGlu1 receptors could be a potential disease modifying treatment for optic neuropathies where no treatment is currently available.","4248":"Cardiomyopathies are a family of heart muscle diseases (HMD) which can cause heart failure, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. While the genetics of many HMD are known, and novel medical treatments are in Phase III clinical trial, there is need to understand how this relates to changes in microstructure. In this proposal, we aim to perform multi-scale phase contrast tomography (X-PCI) on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies from HMD patients with known genetic mutations, and further assess whether myocyte and microvascular organisation relate to disease category and genomics, as suggested by our pilot studies. This information will improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of HMD and provide crucial information for interpretation of future ultrafast imaging studies.","4249":"Maxillofacial surgeries require centimeters cube medical implants for bone reconstruction. Our aim is to study the mechanisms involved in the freeze-casting (FC) process used to form a new type of \u201cbricks & mortar\" composite from bioactive glass nanoparticles (bricks) functionalized with customized polymers (PDLLA, poly (lactic acid), mortar). Our proposal is to use in-situ X-ray phase contrast imaging at ID19: 1) To study the FC formation process. Cooling the solid\/solution interface induces the growth of solvent crystals which forms bricks-mortar walls responsible for the bone grafts microporosity, while bubbles nucleation generate vertical air-channels resulting in the scaffold macropores; 2) To quantitatively assess how hierarchical pores formation governs the scaffolds\u2019 mechanical properties, using a compression load cell.","4250":"The two primary goals of this proposal are: demonstrating X-ray tensor tomography (XTT) with speckle-based imaging for the first time and investigating the unknown sub-micron 3D structure of auditory ossicles within the human middle ear at the macro-scale. XTT allows for the 3D visualisation of X-ray scattering (dark field) from features smaller than the resolution of the imaging system and enables the quantitative detection of the orientation of anisotropic structures within the sample. While the method has successfully been demonstrated using gratings, speckle-based XTT has not been achieved to date. We will apply the novel speckle TT method to the investigation of the main orientation of microstructures within healthy and pathological human middle-ear ossicles. The inner structure of ossicles is largely unknown and further knowledge would be an important step towards a better understanding of hearing loss and the planning and assessment of reconstructive ossicle surgery.","4251":"Following the worldwide epidemics of obesity and metabolic disorders, fatty liver disease is taking the scene as leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The disease progression is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in the hepatic cells and hence by uncontrolled alterations of the hepatocytes. This proposal aims to morphologically characterize human liver tissues of bariatric patients by X-ray nano-holotomography. Thanks to its high spatial and contrast resolution capabilities, the nano-tomographic approach will enable to observe and evaluate hepatocytes inner structures and their 3D distribution with sub-cellular resolution. This is an unprecedent study with the objective to identify relevant hepatic differences at the microscopic level that might be of relevance for the biopsy examination of patients\u2019 tissues.  ","4252":"We propose to investigate the gut of a murine model (SAMP8) of age-related human frailty syndrome to identify pathological alterations by means of nano\r\n X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT). The samples will be measured at different time-points from pre-symptomatic stages to detect and monitor the age-related impairment of intestinal barrier, which is indicated as a disease-relevant site by preliminary data obtained at the ID16 beamline. Since SAMP8 is a\r\n promising model for sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), we believe that the experiment could help to identify predictive signs of structural alterations as frailty indicators of progression to AD in the mouse, especially at the earliest phase of the disease.","4253":"-----------------------------------------------------------","4254":"Bioresorbable magnesium stents are a promising future treatment for coronary artery stenosis. However, even after decades of development, the degradation process, ideal degradation time and biological response in vivo are still not fully understood. The degradation products, such as hydroxides, phosphates, and carbonates, delay the corrosion through the formation of corrosion fronts. We will study the chemistry of these fronts using Ca K-edge \u00b5 XANES spectroscopy. Furthermore, Mg is alloyed with rare earth elements to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties. These elements accumulate as so-called intermetallic particles, due to their slower degradation compared to the matrix material, with unknown systemic toxicological effects. Thus, we will investigate a common and promising Mg alloy and determine the particle composition and if they completely corrode before exiting the corrosion layer, or if they are incorporated into the surrounding tissue through \u00b5XRF.","4255":"Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness provides signals that control cell proliferation, differentiation and death in both physiological and pathological conditions. The proposal aims to investigate the relationship between ECM stiffness and cancer invasion and, in turn, the abundance of endogenous ions and metal within the TME. We will conduct XRF analyses to analyze the effect of substrate rigidity on the distribution of Zinc, Calcium and Sulphur in ECM deposited by ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, we will investigate whether the same metals and other ions show a different pattern of distribution in the ECM secreted by ovarian cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy. This investigation may have translational value, for instance, suggesting targeting of ECM stiffness and metal chelators to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","4256":"The use of implants in arthroplasty is a common method to restore mobility and quality of life. It was recently shown that orthopaedic implants containing the commonly used CoCrMo alloy can release micro- and nanoscale particles as well as Co and Cr ions due to corrosion and abrasive wear. While the local distribution of Co and Cr and the resulting adverse tissue reactions are already well described in literature, little is known about their systemic distribution and possible toxic effects in other organs or tissues. The proposed project aims to investigate the systemic distribution of Co and Cr ions within chicken embryos as a model for vertebrate organisms. For this, embryos will be exposed to defined concentrations of Co and Cr ions. To achieve spatially resolved analysis of metal species in the \u00b5m-range, we aim to perform these investigations using synchrotron based micro-XRF at the ESRF. The obtained results will help to improve the safety and efficacy of arthroplasty implants.","4257":"A crucial step in the etiopathology of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the development of protein aggregates in the brain, which are known as Lewy Bodies (LB) and contain the protein \u03b1-synuclein as a major component. We have recently shown that LBs can form in a minimal system, based on cell culture. The current proposal now aims at a comparative structural and spectromicroscopic study of LBs in two different systems: (a) postmortem-brains of PD patients, (b) LBs in a minimal system (cell culture, controlled over-expression of the protein alpha- synuclein). We will use scanning nano-diffraction as well as  synchrotron radiation-based infrared spectro-microscopy (SR-FTIR). A particular target of the study is the protein secondary conformation in different LB systems. Using the minimal system, we will monitor beta-sheet content as a function of incubation time, as well as other structural and spectromicroscopic parameters.","4258":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary tumour. Its prognosis is very poor, with survival ranging from 12-15 months.  Due to the chemoresistance and highly infiltrative growth of GBM, current treatments can only slow the development of the disease. The main limit to the effectiveness of chemotherapies in the brain is their restricted access due to the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB), which limits the passage of most drugs. Recently, focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with microbubbles, has attracted attention as a non-invasive means of temporarily opening the blood-brain barrier (1). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging is a powerful imaging technique for quantification of trace elements in biological samples. In this study, we propose use XRF to quantify platinum concentrations in the brains of F98 glioma-bearing rats after FUS-enhanced chemotherapy of carboplatin, in comparison to simple carboplatin intravenous injections.","4259":"We want to evaluate morphologic and elemental parameters of the human Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) brain tumor by using multi-scale and multi-modal synchrotron techniques, i.e. X-ray phase contrast tomography (X-PCI-CT) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF).

For this reason, this research team is working on everything from cells to organs ( We formed a network with the UCL research team in the UK, which possesses the best technology for imaging vast areas up to and including organ) at ultra-high resolution, and utilized the European ESRF synchrotron radiation accelerator facility, where this technology is being applied and utilized, to produce dementia model primates. We aim to secure 3D image big data on brain organs and secure leading technology to overcome dementia.","4261":"Approximately 12 million dental implants are placed globally each year, with almost 50% experiencing complications related to bone loss. Progressive bone loss can lead to implant failure and its associated consequences. While it has historically been associated with the bacterial biofilm on the implant, emerging evidence from previous in vitro experiments conducted by our group at the ESRF suggest that biomechanical factors, such as particle abrasion from the implant and\/or the elastic and plastic deformation of the implant upon loading, might also influence the biological changes of the adjacent tissue. To the best of our knowledge, the phenomenon of micromovement of dental implants within human bone remains unexplored. Consequently, this proof-of-concept study aims to investigate the mechanisms induced in the surrounding bone of osseointegrated implants subjected to varying loads using synchrotron-based tomography.","4262":"Peri-implantitis is a multi-factorial complication arising in about 20 % of dental implants (2 Mio implants globally\/year), leading to inflammation, bone loss and eventual implant loss. While titanium wear particles are suspected contributing factors, their biological potential in peri-implantitis remains unclear. The present project aims to study the molecular response to titanium micro-particles in human peri-implant tissue regions using an innovative integration of X-ray computed microtomography (\u00b5CT) with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS), in high throughput. \u00b5CT will allow for the localization of the three-dimensional particle distribution within tissue biopsies, while LC-MS\/MS will enable the identification of protein-level changes induced by titanium particles. This approach will aid in understanding the impact of titanium particles in peri-implantitis pathogenesis and pave the way for modifications of implant surfaces and targeted interventions.","4263":"A correlation between Alzheimer's disease (AD), insulin resistance, and glucose metabolism has been postulated. Beyond its role in blood sugar regulation, insulin exhibits potential neuroprotective effects, and its resistance in the brain may be linked to accelerate cognitive aging and AD. Pilot clinical studies reveal that insulin administration improves memory performance; it has been hypothesized that insulin acts by enhancing the synaptic plasticity and conformationally disrupting the brain amyloid beta plaques. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of insulin administration - a candidate therapeutic intervention for dementia - on the structure of amyloid beta plaques, the neuronal and capillary network and on the surrounding microenvironment in the brain of AD mice by comparing insulin-treated AD mice with untreated AD mice and healthy wild-type mice as controls. \r\n","4264":"The precise organization of cellular porosity in tooth dentin remains ill-understood due to the lack of experimental 3D data. This multiscale porosity remains challenging to image because of the high resolution required (better than 50 nm), the low absorption contrast and radiation sensitivity. In this proposal, we aim to use state of the art holotomography with highest possible resolution (25 nm pixel size) to image the cellular network in very thin sample stripes. This data will be site-matched with confocal fluorescence microscopy images and serve as gold standard for network analysis. Samples of different age groups from 16-42 years old healthy human patients will be analyzed to assess changes in cellular porosity as a function of age. This fundamental work is intended to provide the first brick to achieve an accurate modeling of fluid flow inside dentin which is known to mediate mechanosensing at the organ level.","4265":"Modern medicine relies heavily on metal implants. Recent studies suggest that even low levels of metal exposure can activate T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, leading to chronic inflammation and implant failure. However, the causal link between 'metal allergy' and the condition of the implant is still unknown. Our initial feasibility analysis revealed the presence of implant-associated particles in the lymph nodes of one patient, providing a basis for further systematic investigation. It is essential to reveal how implant \u2013associated metals are presented to T cells in the lymph nodes. We aim to quantify and spatially correlate metal exposure, protein and immune cell distribution in human lymph node sections by combining \u00b5XRF and \u00b5XANES analysis with mass spectrometry-based molecular imaging techniques. We will provide new insights into the biological effects of implant-related metal exposure and their role in the chronic inflammation associated with implant failure.","4266":"DCIS is a precancerous stage of breast cancer with unpredictable progression to invasive cancer (IDC), potentially resulting in overtreatment. Microcalcifications (MCs), which are calcium deposits commonly found in DCIS, vary in composition from calcium phosphate (CaP) to less common non-CaP minerals. Many studies focused on the crystal properties of CaP, indicating their association with malignancy and potential diagnostic value. However, our study investigates the relationship between properties of non-CaP MCs and progression of DCIS to IDC. Our retrospective analysis of samples from DCIS patients revealed a significant presence of calcium carbonate crystals, including dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously documented in the human body. Utilizing u-XRF and u-XRD, we aim to characterize the crystal properties of these MCs and to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying dolomite crystallization within the human body. ","4267":"Amelogenesis Imperfecta(AI) is a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders, which affects the genes responsible for enamel formation, which, in turn affect the development and quality of dental enamel. Subclassifications of AI include hypoplastic, hypomature or hypocalcified depending on the protein affected. The hypoplastic AI is the most frequent type of AI caused by mutations of proteins (e.g.AMELX) or are due to mutations in larger master genes (e.g.FAM20A). Having identified areas with disrupted enamel on labial and lingual regions of enamel by laboratory X-ray microtomography we intend to conduct 2D \u00b5-XRD mapping of 5 hypoplastic AI and 4 control teeth. Following acquisition of data on the XMaS, we will perform SEM imaging on each specimen, allowing correlation data obtained from SXRD and XMT. We will be able to compare and contrast the crystallite disruption and pathogenicity observed previously with hypomature AI. Thereby establishing a multiscale genotype-phenotype correlation.","4268":"Valvular heart disease (VHD) is the 3rd commonest cardiovascular disease after hypertension and coronary disease, predominantly affecting the aortic valve (AoV). Degeneration of the AoV causes pressure-overload (aortic stenosis; AS) or volume-overload (aortic regurgitation; AR) of the left ventricle. The resultant adverse remodelling of the myocardium eventually results in adverse outcomes including heart failure, arrhythmia and premature death. While we and others have studied the adverse remodelling by standard light microscopy and cardiac magnetic resonance, there is a need to understand how this relates to changes in microstructure. In this proposal, we aim to perform multi-scale phase contrast tomography on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies from patients with severe AS or AR who have undergone aortic valve replacement, and further assess whether myocyte and microvascular organisation relate to disease category and macrostructural remodelling by cardiac MRI.","4269":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour.

In this context, sinus floor augmentation (SFA) procedures have become a well-established pre-implantology procedure. To avoid harvesting autogenous bone grafts, there has been an ever increasing quest for adequate bioactive bioceramic synthetic bone grafting materials, which enhance bone formation and degrade in timely fashion. In the context of our research program novel bioceramics based on a silica containing calcium alkali orthophosphate (Si-CAOP) were developed, displaying a better biodegradability than the clinically established tricalcium phosphates (TCP).  To this end, and in order to shed light on the complex bioactive ceramic enhanced bio-regeneration of the bone tissue non-destructively in 3D, synchrotron microtomography (S\u00b5CT) is then used to study samples from theses biopsies of bioregenerated bone in the sinus floor 6 months after implantation. ","4271":"Plastics are used in a plethora of daily-life products, and among them plastic beverage bottles and food trays, which may release some particles in food during the storage. Environmental pollution with micro and nanoplastics constitute another source of human contamination, as they enter in the food chain via primary consumers and end up in human food. In this case, the ingested particles are weathered in the environment by exposure to UV light and high temperatures, and are potentially  surface-polluted by environmental co-contaminants such as metals. The objective of this project is to image via nano-XRM the intracellular accumulation, distribution in human intestinal cells of polyethylene terephtalate microparticles (PET), when co-exposed with tributyltin (TBT) chosen as environmental co-contaminant; and to analyse tin speciation as TBT would be metabolized by cells, leading to toxicity. This would inform on the mechanisms of microplastics and environmental co-pollutants toxicity.","4272":"Gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCA) are applied intravenously (i.v.) to patients to enhance the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gd-based MRI is a cornerstone of non-invasive imaging in the context of stroke. Late Gd enhancement (LGE) in carotid plaques has previously been associated with rupture-prone plaque phenotypes, but reasons for LGE are largely unknown. Recent findings indicate that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) might act as initiator of Gd-retention. Therefore, we plan to use synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis (SR-\u03bcXRF) for imaging Gd distribution in tissue sections of human atherosclerotic plaques, and to correlate the Gd distribution with histological markers. Our results will contribute to elucidate the mechanisms of Gd accumulation in atherosclerotic tissues, might influence the safety assessment of GBCA and also might lead to a reassessment of diagnostic criteria for GBCA-enhanced MRI of human carotid atherosclerosis.","4273":"","4274":"","4275":"","4278":"","4279":"Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising additive manufacturing technique that allows for structures to be built with a high degree of freedom of design and repair large components.

We propose to conduct real-time diffraction-contrast and pair-distribution imaging studies of lovastatin crystallization in a concentric anti-solvent flow crystallizer as a function of concentrations and flow rates. Industrial manufacturing of lovastatin is challenging as it crystallizes as needles that are complex to process, so a deeper understanding of the relationship between crystallization conditions and crystal habit is required. The flow field in this crystallizer enables us to spatially separate mixing, supersaturated phase, nucleation and crystal growth. This permits unprecedented insight into the sequence of molecular and mesoscopic events that determine the properties of the crystalline product.","4281":"The gamma\/gamma\u2019-lattice misfit delta is an important structural parameter of Ni-base superalloys determining the efficiency of precipitate strengthening and the thermal stability of the g\/g\u2019-microstructure. A fundamental question is: which sign of delta is beneficial for creep strength of superalloys? The sign of delta determines the orientation of g\u2019-rafts forming under creep conditions. At high temperature under tensile load and delta<0 the g\u2019-phase forms rafts Normal to axis (N-rafts), but if delta>0 the forming rafts are Parallel (P-rafts). Under compressive load it is vice versa: P-rafts at delta<0 and N-rafts at delta>0. From different arguments it was concluded that delta>0 should be beneficial for the creep strength. But until now no direct experimental proof of these theoretical predictions exists. Two equivalent Ni-base alloys with the same absolute values of misfit but opposite misfit signs are designed, cast as single-crystal bars and tested under creep conditions.","4282":"This proposal concerns to study the dynamic response of additively manufactured auxetic metamaterials made from metal. This particular class of lattice structure metamaterials displays unconventional material behaviour: it contracts laterally rather than expands upon compression. As a consequence, specific strength and stiffness are potentially better than for other lattice or porous materials, which makes these materials interesting for light-weight crash absorbers. An important question in this context is, from what critical velocity onwards the auxetic structural response is replaced by a cell collapse mechanism. Real-time visualization of this mechanism in the bulk of the material can only be performed with X-ray imaging. Preliminary investigations of the dynamic effects have shown that critical velocities are ~100-200 m\/s, which can be attained with the gas gun setup at ID19.","4285":"We propose to perform in-situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction experiments to study microstructure evolution during Additive Manufacturing (AM) of a 316L Stainless Steel (316LSS).

For this purpose, the fuel pins are currently being stored in the fuel ponds of the former reprocessing plant, THORP, at Sellafield. Under these wet conditions, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) has been observed on the cladding of some fuel pins, jeopardizing the containment of radioactive material inside the cladding.\r\nResidual stress in the cladding, caused by Pellet-Cladding Interaction (PCI) is suspected to be the driving force behind the SCC. The nature and magnitude of these stresses, and the quantity of affected fuel pins are currently unknown.\r\nFor this purpose, the Incremental Centre Hole Drilling (ICHD) technique is being adapted for application on AGR fuel.

Due to the high cooling rate, the formation of undesirable microstructural features such as cracks and pores are common. These limitations have hindered laser technology from reaching its full industrial potential. Manipulating the thermal field has the potential to satisfactorily control the microstructure and residual stress. A secondary laser can provide flexible and controllable approach to achieve thermal manipulation. However, this new approach cannot be fully evaluated using traditional a posteriori techniques due to the transient nature. We developed a laser system, enabling the elucidation of underlying physics in situ. Here, we propose to combine ID31\u2019s high energy range with our in situ laser system. We will perform in situ synchrotron XRD at ESRF to under-stand the mechanism of microstructure and stress evolution during laser processing and how a secondary laser can manipulate and improve the process.","4291":"Different forms of porosity can occur in the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process, hence the hot isostatic pressing method (HIP) is becoming a routine postprocessing method for critical applications: this closes the pores and improves the microstructure through high temperature and simultaneous high pressure. However, despite performance improvements that are well proven, some pores may open up on subsequent heat treatment, indicating that these pores have been \u201csqueezed\u201d and not fully closed. This work focusses on imaging these HIPed \u201csqueezed\u201d pores in different static samples at high resolution, artificially induced and characterized prior to HIP by lab CT. In situ heat treatment using a furnace at beamline ID19 in combination with rapid \u03bcCT scans will allow visualization of the opening of these pores in near real time. The gained knowledge is important for an improved understanding of the porosity in L-PBF material and about which pores are more critical.","4292":"Carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) are critical materials in the move to Net Zero for their unique high stiffness and tensile strength-to-weight ratio. However, their Achilles\u2019 heel is their poor compressive strength due to premature failure by kinking. Kink bands forms suddenly and catastrophically, and it is known that fibre waviness\/misalignment is key to its early onset. Catastrophic kink-band initiation is known to form in less than 0.2 ms1, requiring extremely fast in situ X-ray imaging, to resolve the event with the necessary high spatial resolution. Here, we propose to combine ID19\u2019s high flux with our in situ ten-sion-compression rig to perform fast synchrotron radiography at > 100 kHz to understand the mechanism of kink banding during CFRPs compressive failure and how the carbon fibre microstructure im-pacts\/triggers the kink bands for the first time.","4294":"Additive Manufacture (AM) of high temperature Ni alloys has significant potential for the intricate cooling features found in jet engines. However, existing Ni superalloys are unsuitable for AM as they exhibit strain age cracking after manufacture. Neural networks and thermodynamic simulations have recently been used to design a new range of Ni superalloys with tailored \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2019 compositions that overcome this issue. High temperature lab X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD) has been shown to be insufficient to quantify and validate this analysis. Therefore, in this study, synchrotron XRD will be used verify, optimise and refine these models by characterising the lattice mismatch between \u03b3 and \u03b3\u2019 in 6 of these alloys.

The huge industrial potential of LAM would be further unlocked by tailoring the \u2018un-printable\u2019 high-performance engineering alloys for the ultra-fast non-equilibrium solidification process. It is necessary to understand the highly transient mechanisms occurring during rapid solidification.

In response to the reviewer of previous round about why there is interest in pores at 650 degrees for Ti6Al4V as this is not an operating temperature: Additive manufacturing is maturing very well but porosity remains an issue - pores act as stress concentration locations, initiating cracks and failure under cyclic loading. Hot isostatic pressing is widely used now for critical applications to eliminate this threat, since it has been shown to close pores, improve microstructure and, consequently improve fatigue properties. However, a deeper understanding of this pore closure is needed. This project aims to image and provide insight into pores that have been closed but then re-open after subsequent heat treatment. Not because heat treatment is expected in practice but to better understand the \"squeezed pores state\".

High fracture toughness relies upon energy dissipation during crack propagation and the BN interphase between the SiC fibre and the SiBCN matrix plays a key role. Here we will use fast in situ X-ray tomography on ID19 to reveal the role of the interphase during failure under 3 point-bending and compact tension with the necessary high speed and spatial resolution (2 tomos per second and 1 \u03bcm voxel resolution) to quantify the energy absorbing fibre-pull-out mechanisms for the first time.

It has been shown that ice damage initiates well before the measured maximum stress is reached and thus is likely to have a strong influence on the measured dynamic response. We propose to examine, for the first time, subsurface fracture initiation and propagation in two types of atmospheric ice, formed at different temperatures (Rime and Glaze), resulting in distinct microstructures. We seek to utilise real-time phase contrast X-ray radiography to reveal the link between key microstructure features (pores, flaws) and initiation of subsurface cracks during dynamic loading with a cooled Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) system. This understanding is essential for the development of new microstructure-informed damage models for ice, which in turn are needed for safety assessment of aerospace engine components.","4300":"Bimetallic structures, a combination of two different metals, have gained broad attention in recent years because of their multifunctional properties integrated in a single structure component. The 316L-Ni bimetallic structure we produced via directed energy deposition (DED) inherits excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility from AISI 316L stainless steel, and high electrical and thermal conductivities from pure nickel. However, there is a sharp microstructural transition region: the grain structure is distinguished at the interface due to the sudden change in the composition. Such discontinuity brings about the fracture weakness due to the interfacial residual strain. We seek to investigate the interfacial strain field during mechanical loading of this bimetallic structure by using in situ transmission X-ray powder diffraction. Various DED parameters will be assessed, hence providing guidance to optimise the manufacturing routine for industrial and scientific community.","4301":"High voltage LNO are the most promising candidates for commercialization, due to their high mass-specific energy density, high operating voltages and initial high capacity. However, during delithiation at high voltage, these materials presents phase reactions involving large volume changes, which cause cracks and capacity fade.

The main driving force that settles the structure is considered as the gravity. However, when the spherical particle size is less than 30-50 microns, air friction starts to dominate the particles\u2019 motion. The crucial question remains to be answered: what is the particle size effect on the self-assembly crystallization process? We seek to observe the self-assembly process of spherical particles of various sizes using in situ micro-tomography, therefore identifying the influence zone of this size effect.","4305":"Cathode engineering the particle morphology has emerged as a promising route for increasing capacity retention in lithium batteries, with the recent million-mile single crystalline (SC) cathodes, where interparticle cracking and oxygen loss are suppressed compared to their polycrystalline (PC) counterparts.

The carbonization mechanism of plastic waste treated by catalyzed APC has been scarcely explored and no reports are available concerning the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) technique. It has been shown that the catalyzed APC of polyethylene bags and polystyrene cups leads to paramagnetic, conducting pure carbon microspheres with various morphologies and compositions. In this project, we aim to study in situ the real-time carbonization of common plastic waste (e.g., cigarette filters) to highlight differences in phase, composition, interlayer spacing, porosity, defectivity, and microscopic texture before, during, and after the thermal conversion, and to clarify the mechanism as a function of plastic type, carbonization temperature and residence time using the WAXS technique and coupling it with the pair distribution function.\r\n","4312":"Establishing viable 2nd life opportunities for batteries retired from EV applications is central to improving the circularity of the battery economy.

It can be problematic due to the mechanical instability of cracked electrodes and is a particular hindrance to thicker electrodes and those based on aqueous slurries. Alternatively, controlled cracking may facilitate ion diffusion and improve battery performance and durability for fast charging of thick electrodes. This proposed experiment will elucidate the mechanisms of crack formation using phase and absorption contrast imaging at ID19 over a range of scales to directly observe crack nucleation and evolution for the first time. This improved understanding will enable control of the cracking process, allowing more advanced electrodes to be slurry cast industrially.","4315":"This proposal compares extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and burst-wave lithotripsy (BWL) with the aim to identify the most suitable clinical modality to comminute body calculi.

It is also likely that cavitation will occur during high-velocity impacts, contributing to the formation and propagation of cracks and shock waves. However, at these concentrations, shear-thickening fluids become opaque, hindering the visualisation of crack formation with conventional imaging techniques.

This leads to Kirkendall-induced porosity near the joint interface, potentially causing joint failure. The porosity evolution depends on material composition, crystallography, temperature, and stress duration. The study aims to investigate similar conditions as a previous study (ME 1513) but with a Ni\/CMSX-4 joint with different crystallographic orientations and annealing times. Combining the experimental \u00b5-tomography data with the phase-field and continuum simulations should provide information into the complicated mechanisms of void  formation, evolution and kinetics of the kirkendall-porosity.\r\n\r\n","4327":"Ceramic materials like zirconia and alumina are becoming more and more important in the biomedical area. With the development of 3D printing techniques, as vat photopolymerization (VPP), the design and manufacturing of complex geometries for Bone Tissue Engineering (BTE) scaffolds became possible. Multilayer geometries have been proposed to increase toughness, slow crack propagation and improve reliability. The study of the residual stresses in 3D layered geometries is difficult to be predicted by analytical models and few experimental tests have been conducted to analyse the stress profile. Employing the X-ray Synchrotron Diffraction, and particularly the Laue microdiffraction, it\u2019s possible to evaluate the superficial stress profile for a depth up to hundreds of micrometres. The experimentally obtained stress data can be used to validate numerical models which predicts the residual stresses in complex geometries and assess the overall apparent toughness of layered 3D BTE scaffolds.","4328":"The armored skin of long-spine pufferfish contains a repetitive pattern of very thin interfaces of highly mineralized hard spines and highly stretchable soft skin.\r\nActivating this armor as a defense mechanism exposes the interfaces to two extreme conditions: body inflation stretches the skin and induces tension strains to the interface; rigid spines receive intense stresses forming complex strains-stresses at the interfaces. In this project, we study the role of soft-hard interfaces in the spiny skin of porcupinefish in preventing mechanical failures under extreme conditions despite a drastic mechanical mismatch. Hence,\r\nwe aim to understand the architectural morphology of the skin-spine interfaces and their reorganizations, which opens possibilities for the next generation of load-bearing, stretchable biomaterials with encoded functions.","4329":"This proposal seeks to elucidate how damage in novel thermoplastic composite materials develops at the ply scale, and how damage accumulation depends on the loading velocity with particular focus on high-rate loading. Answering these research questions is only possible with ESRF ID19\u2019s unique capability of in-situ monitored high-velocity loading experiments whilst performing sub-surface phase-contrast X-Ray imaging in the MHz range. The scarcity of experimental evidence on that topic is currently a limiting factor in the development of physically-based models for these materials. It has also traditionally led to oversized structures in the transport industry, especially for accident situations (e.g., collision and\/or impact). Consequently, this investigation results should enable a better understanding of the physics of damage in that material, allow the development of advanced behaviour law and lead to most accurate design possible for future structural parts.","4330":"Kirkendall porosity forms and develops in joints made of different materials exposed to high temperatures over a long period of time. This is due to the diffusion of elements accompanied by a vacancy flux. Hence, in a materials combination of pure Ni and Ni-base superalloy CMSX-4 joined by diffusion welding, alloying elements move from CMSX-4 to pure Ni, while Ni atoms and vacancies move in the opposite direction. However, the detailed development of the Kirkendall porosity, such as the time of the start of the pore formation and then of further growth, also in relation to the distance to the diffusion-welded interface, is still unknown. Furthermore, the shape of the developing voids depends on time, temperature and crystallographic orientations. In-situ 3D \u00b5-tomography can answer the kinetics of the forming and developing Kirkendall porosity.

For decreasing the green hydrogen cost to comparable levels to hydrogen produced by steam reforming, the electrolyzer systems must be optimised. One of the most significant energy losses during electrolyzer operation at industrial conditions is due to inefficient mass transport. \r\nPrevious neutron radiographic measurements have indicated that bubbles are immobilized in industrial porous foam electrodes, effectively increasing the resistance and decreasing the available surface area in the system. By performing x-ray imaging we will be able to study the growth, movement, and distribution of bubbles for improved understanding on this critical topic. The electrolyzer is constructed in cooperation with the industry to obtain the most industrially relevant and accurate knowledge on bubble dynamics.\r\n","4332":"Natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites will play a crucial role in meeting NetZero requirements as they combine environmental sustainability with excellent mechanical properties at low weight. Despite their advantages, such composites exhibit poor performance under compressive loading due to issues like fibre kinking.  Our focus turns to understanding the behaviour of kinking during compressive failure. This requires high frame rate imaging, as catastrophic kink band initiation occurs quickly. To capture this event with the necessary high spatial resolution, we propose in-situ compression on ID19. In this beamtime, we aim to understand the compressive performance of newly developed flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) composites, in which the epoxy resin is made of renewable resources, the so-called \u2018greenpoxy\u2019. This work will lead to new designs to improve their compressive performance by suppressing kinking band formation.","4333":"The anode-free form of lithium battery offers a large potential benefit in energy density over traditional Li-ion, however suffers from severe performance degradation during cycling. Capacity loss is typically attributed to extensive Li inventory reduction associated with the continual creation of excess SEI and \u201cdead\u201d Li. The morphology of the Li plated during cell charging is a key performance driver, with dense, planar films preferable over high surface area dendrites. New electrolyte formulations to control morphology are a promising solution, however their effect remains unclear, particularly under repeated cycling. Here we propose to study the morphology of plated Li in the presence of various electrolytes, comparing pristine and aged samples.

The disruption of spinal joints is related to alterations in the tissue structure and biomechanics at the micro- and nanoscale. However, measuring such changes quantitatively in intact organs remains challenging. Here, we will apply a ground-breaking multiscale synchrotron X-ray imaging technique developed by us (TomoSAXS) to measure for the first time the 3D fibrillar nanostructure in human IVD in healthy and diseased conditions, using high-energy SAXS and phase-contrast tomography.

This technique was successfully implemented in the forward direction at NanoMAX to study nano-indented Si wavers. The study of the dynamical diffraction echoes in Ni in the diffraction direction can only be performed in a beamline with the beam properties and detector geometry such as ID01.

We have expanded our SBI image retrieval software to model dark-field as anisotropic blurring, allowing us to retrieve directional dark-field projections from SBI data. We will then extract directional, volumetric scattering data, similar to X-ray tensor tomography. This signal is especially useful for materials with a strongly directional microstructure.

While the effect has been demonstrated by several groups with visible photons, ultra-cold atoms, and electrons  it has never been demonstrated with x-rays. The demonstration of IFM with x-rays will open intriguing possibilities for measurements with reduced dose mainly for biological samples where radiation damage can be a significant limitation. On the fundamental side, the use of the high efficiency photon number resolving x-ray detectors can be used for the test of the effect at the theoretical limit, which is hard to do with optical photons.

These 3D CZT sensors can acts as building element for instrumentation in next generation of high-energy telescopes, such as focal planes of new high energy focussing optics (e.g. broadband Laue lenses). A fine spectroscopy combined with sub-mm position resolution in 3D and a powerful digital readout will allow the precise reconstruction of the photon interaction, a feature that is essential to achieve, at the time, high efficiency and response uniformity, good background rejection capabilities, and high sensitivity in scattering polarimetry.

TexTom differs from SASTT as it uses a projection model, which uses all available reflections in the diffraction pattern and not just a single q-range, as SASTT does. We propose to deploy this technique at ID15A and study the attainable real and reciprocal space resolution on a custom-designed texture test pattern. In this way, we will obtain ground truth data before the technique finds wider application on biomaterials such as the bone-tendon enthesis or technical materials such as fibre reinforced polymers.

This proposal will implement and develop the first speckle-based dark-field tensor-tomography experiments, at ID19. Currently, using speckle-based approaches, directional dark-field imaging is limited to projection, therefore providing only two-dimensional information. Current tensor-tomography techniques require tomographic data to be collected about multiple axes of rotation. Due to the two-dimensional sensitivity of speckle-based imaging, data is required about only two rotation axes, making it more dose efficient. We have developed the critical underlying theoretical formalisms and believe that experimental implementation is the next significant step to develop speckle-based X-ray imaging into a user-friendly high-resolution imaging modality.","4361":"X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XRF-CT) is an important imaging technique that provides three-dimensional chemical maps.

Despite its success XRF-CT faces several challenges related to the requirement to focus the incident beam and raster scan the sample. We propose to exploit an innovative approach known as Ghost Imaging for XRF-CT that eliminates the need for raster scanning the sample and that can be used as a full field imaging method. This approach has several advantages including (a) a significant reduction in the measurement time or deposited dose, (b) measuring more complex samples and at higher resolutions compared to present-day techniques, (c) higher tolerance to positioning drifts.

Full-field X-ray imaging can reach such resolution if the setup is combined with strongly focusing optics capable of generating the desired magnification. In this kind of imaging approach, the phase contrast modality is preferred due to the fact that, at this scale, samples present very low absorption and therefore low contrast. To the best of our knowledge Dark Field (DF) has never been measured at spatial resolution better than a micron. The ambition of this proposal is to perform speckle-based imaging to extend the DF range to the nanoscale.","4363":"This proposal aims at developing an advanced 3D X-ray ptychographic imaging technique that can achieve volumetric imaging with high spatial resolution and fast data acquisition. Ptychography can be extended to 3D imaging in two ways: multi-slice ptychography or ptychographic tomography. Ptychographic tomography relies on 2D ptychography to supply projections to conventional tomographic algorithms, whilst multi-slice ptychography uses the redundancy in ptychographic data to split the reconstruction into a series of axial slices. Whilst multi-slice ptychography can handle thick specimens and has a much smaller data requirement than ptychographic tomography, its depth resolution is relatively poor. Here we propose an imaging modality that combines the benefits of the two approaches, enabling isotropic 3D resolution imaging with a smaller number of angular measurements than theoretically required by 4-5 times.","4364":"While Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) has been successfully applied in different material systems, it is less successful for highly strained nanocrystals. Merging the wavefront modulation concept into BCDI will be a feasible strategy to break its limitation.

Inspired by a previously developed theoretical frame work, we propose the utilization of a pencil beam and X-ray powder diffraction for the tomographic reconstruction of local strain distributions achieving an aspect ratio of 1:1. A test scan at PETRA III showed encouraging results, but reconstruction quality was severely affected by anisotropic diffraction caused by an undersized beam.

Connexins are the conventional intercellular channels that mediate electrical neurotransmission across synapses and are modulated by several intracellular factors like calmodulin. On the other hand, other members of the family resemble the structural organisation of connexin hemichannels, but are primarily involved in the efflux of ATP from cells. The ATP-release channels are also called Pannexins and are vital to mediate apoptotic cell death and inflammation processes. The ATP release is mediated by the C-terminus of the Pannexin channels that control entry into the channel pore and cleavage of the C-terminus leads to large efflux of ATP from cells.

The primary target cells for leptin are neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Under normal physiological conditions leptin signaling acts as a molecular feedback mechanism that reduces appetite and stimulates energy expenditure. In conditions of leptin resistance, a decreased sensitivity to leptin signaling results in the inability to sense satiety which leads to the development of obesity. Despite decades of research on leptin and its receptor (LepR) as key regulators of body weight and homeostasis, the mechanism for the assembly of the leptin signaling complex is poorly understood at the molecular level. Building on recently acquired structural and mechanistic insights we produced a stabilized version of the extracellular assembly of the human leptin complex suitable for high-resolution cryoEM imaging.","4672":"The idea is to characterize cerasomes particles.

In this way, SARM1 activation is directly triggered by a decrease in the concentration of NAD+ (a hallmark of several stress conditions), and not necessarily only by the introduction of an activating factor. Very recently, we have also determined the cryo EM structure of SARM1 in a metastable duplex conformation, induced by a new inhibitor that we have discovered.

Target alteration can result from the spontaneous mutation of a bacterial gene or can be mediated via modifying enzymes. For example Erythromycin resistance methyltransferases (Erms)  specifically mono\/dimethylates the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Methylation of the target site by Erms helps the pathogens to develop resistance to several classes of drug moieties. The target base, A2058, is buried deep inside the rRNA scaffold in the mature 50S ribosomal subunit and remains inaccessible to Erms. Deciphering the structure of 50S precursor-Erm complex would help in delineating the targeting mechanism of methyltransferase. in a ribosomal setting. Understanding the targeting determinants can be exploited towards the design of drugs in order to reverse the onset of resistance.

Additionally, nsp14 carries an exonuclease domain, which operates in the proofreading system. nsp14 and nsp16 were reported to independently bind nsp10, but the available structural information suggests that the concomitant interaction between these three proteins should be impossible due to steric clashes. In our work (https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2022.01.25.477673v1 ), we show that nsp14, nsp10, and nsp16 can form a ternary complex (MST, enzymatic assays, SAXS, TEM). This interaction is expected to encourage formation of mature capped viral mRNA, modulating the nsp14 exonuclease activity, and protecting the viral RNA. A high-resolution structure of the triplex would greatly improve the understanding of how the component proteins are undergoing the structural changes upon the ternary complex formation.","4677":"We aim at solving the structure of temporal photosynthetic supercomplexes such as Photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) during steady state and under stress conditions by the cryo EM technique.

However, the herd immunity against poxviruses is dwindling in humans. Accordingly, poxviruses including monkeypox virus are considered as potentially highly threatening for their pandemic \u2018spillover\u2019 risk. Here, we strive to develop novel virostatics for the fight of poxviral dieases.

The latter is particularly important for SSX with respect to radiation damage. Thus, our BAG proposal has two aspects, a technical one, the implementation and comparison of various sample delivery approaches at ID29, using a highly radiation sensitive metalloprotein model system and a scientific one, the structure determination of a predicted but so far elusive flavin N5-oxide intermediate of the enzyme EncM. Obviously, the technical aspect not only affects the scientific aspect, but also has implications for the community at large using SSX.","4685":"We are developing a new serial crystallography instrument for next generation synchrotron facilities in order to make the synchrotron serial crystallography (SSX) more accessible for end users.

We expect that the throughput is improved by an order of magnitude from the crystallisation setup to data acquisition. The proposed instrument combines the acoustic levitation diffractometer (ALD) the new standardised crystallisation plate developed at PSI with the high flux polychromatic beam at the ESRF and a high frame rate integrating detector.","4686":"In the past, many macromolecular complexes could not be structurally characterized at atomic resolution as they were unsuitable for crystallization and X-ray crystallography and as electron microscopy could not provide high resolution data. This changed rapidly in the last decade, as tremendous progress was achieved in the single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) field. Meanwhile, cryo-EM became the method of choice to determine the structure of such complexes, opening a new era of structural biology. In this BAG we will, using cryo-EM, determine the structures of complicated protein machineries including large multi-subunit complexes, protein-nucleic acid complexes and membrane protein complexes. Our projects will contribute to improve the understanding of the molecular basis of energy conversion and cellular respiration, nitrate and ammonium metabolism, ribosome and ribosome-associated functions, DNA damage repair and maintenance.","4689":"This BAG application builds on the development of single particle cryo-EM in the Italian Structural Biology community, as in Italy there is no top-end instrument available. The groups in this application have acquired know-how in cryo.EM through international collaborations or by acquiring medium-level in-house equipment. Access to the CM01 beamline at the ESRF has been instrumental for the achievement of high-profile scientific results and publications in top journals. Presently three screening microscopes are available in Italy, these instruments will boost sample production and the number of applications to CM01. Given these premises a BAG from Italian institutions could ensure timely data collection, nurturing the expansion of the field in Italy and a high-level scientific production.","4691":"Structural biology research groups located in India constitute the INDIA-BAG and will utilize MX & SAXS to study different biological macromolecules.

A brief description of over 50 research groups is provided in the global summary and a summary of their research contributions involving data collected at ESRF is provided in the 2 year BAG report. The ESRF-India partnership is supported by a single grant provided to the RCB by the DBT. Please note that a report listing no. of shifts utilized, details of users and the research output from these visits has to be sent to the DBT to obtain release of funds to pay ESRF membership dues. Consequently, all the structural biologists from India are grouped in a single BAG to enable monitoring of progress to collect the required statistics. \r\n","4693":"This BAG coordinates activities of groups from the South-West of the UK. The focus is on projects in Immunology, transcriptional regulation, and enzymology. A particular strength are the macromolecular complexes that several of the groups target.

Cardiff is joining the bag as a new member. \r\n\r\nPlease note comments in the report on COVID and sample shipment. Experimental work has been affected by Covid, which has reduced the output, and by travel restrictions.  Further, we have had problems with loosing samples on transport as they were held up in customs, with three affected shipments. Due to these complexities Portsmouth have decided to leave the bag.","4694":" The Radiation Damage BAG investigates the fundamental mechanisms of radiation damage.

It is composed of 18 groups distributed in 4 research Institutes.","4712":"Drug resistance is a major public health threat, as it results in an untreatable pathology with very poor prognosis. Often, drug resistance is associated with multi-drug resistance, which is the ability of a microbe or cancer cell to resist to many structurally unrelated drugs. The disease is thus resistant to virtually all the therapeutic arsenal. One of the major mechanisms to create this resistance is the active efflux out of the cell of the active compounds. This simply decreases the drug concentration inside the cell bellow cytotoxic levels. We investigate this mechanism in this proposal. We are investigating the structural transition of the transporter to expel the drug, having already collected 4 datasets along the transition path. This proposal is the continuation of a previous proposal, to obtain the last dataset before publication. Data have already been collected on the IBS Glacios, but limited at 6\u00c5 resolution. We are applying for Krios beamtime to reach higher resolution. ","4713":"PolD is an archaeal replicative DNA polymerase that possesses an atypical catalytic core (two-barrel) that is only found in RNA polymerases. \r\nWe have reported he individual crystal structures of each subunit of PolD (Sauguet et al. 2016) as well as the Cryo-EM structure of PolD in complex with DNA (Raia et al , 2019) and PCNA (a processivity factor) (Madru et al. 2020). So far, the structure of the ternary complex of PolD with an incoming nucleotide and a DNA or RNA primer across a DNA template has not yet been resolved (Elongation mode). \r\nSuch a structure has been challenging to obtain with a wild type version of PolD due to the flexibility of the primer substrate in the protein, we therefore created two different PolD variants (each including a different set of mutations) that showed to stabilize the elongation mode of PolD. Resolving these structures would be crucial to understand the positioning of the nucleotide in such a DNA polymerase with a unique catalytic core fold. \r\n","4715":"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are Class C GPCRs. They are obligate dimers, dimerization being fundamental for their function. mGluRs are activated by the binding of the main excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, within an extracellular domain (ECD). Conformational changes induced by glutamate-binding are then transmitted to the transmembrane domain composed of 7 transmembrane helices (7TM) that allows signal transduction within the cell. Class C GPCR activity can be modulated by the binding of Positive Allosteric Modulators (PAM) or Negative Allosteric Modulators (NAM) to the 7TM. Our research interest is to understand the structural basis of class C GPCR dimers signal transduction and their allosteric regulation. Multiple structures of PAM bound receptor will be solved and they will provide a comprehensive understanding on the nature of ligand binding in the 7TM as well as conformational changes associated to the binding of PAM at the mGlu receptor. ","4716":"The onset of antimicrobial resistance is primarily brought about by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Among the various ways microbes develop resistance, target modification offers a convenient and efficient way via which pathogens can bypass the effect of these drugs. Target alteration can result from the spontaneous mutation of a bacterial gene or can be mediated via modifying enzymes. Erythromycin resistance methyltransferases (Erms) is an example of the latter and specifically mono\/dimethylates the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Methylation of the target site by Erms helps the pathogens to develop resistance to several classes of drug moieties, i.e., the macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B families. The structure of the 50S precursor-Erm complex will help to delineate the rRNA and protein structure-based determinants determinants that facilitate such a specific catalytic process.","4717":"Microtubules composed of \uf061\uf02d\uf062 tubulin heterodimer units undergo constant growth and shrinkage. This property is defined as dynamic instability, which is an integral part of the cellular activity. In neurons, the dynamic microtubules are present together with stable microtubules. Several microtubule-associated proteins (MAP) have been characterized for regulating dynamic microtubules, however the molecular mechanisms used to stabilise microtubules are largely unknown.  Our team study the neuronal microtubule stabiliser MAP6 for several years and showed recently that MAP6 binds inside and outside the microtubule cylinder. Deciphering at the molecular level how MAP6 binds to microtubules (outside and inside) will help to understand how this microtubule associated protein increases the stability of microtubules in neurons. ","4718":"The alternative complement pathway (AP) is a crucial part of the human innate immune system and is in first line of defence against invading pathogens. The AP is solicited by pathogen proteins which often interact with human complement factor 3 (C3), the central hub of the complement cascade. This interaction is sufficient to block progression of the complement cascade. Within the AP, the first step of activation involves the conversion of C3 into C3(H2O) which forms the fluid-phase convertase.  \r\nThe aim of the proposal is to resolve for the first time the structure of intact C3(H2O) at near-atomic resolution. Previously we obtained a preliminary structure of C3(H2O) with a small data set at low resolution. The high-resolution structure of C3(H20) will inform about the conformational changes that occur upon cleavage of the thioester bond while the ANA domain (C3a when released) is still being present.","4719":"The conformational flexibility of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a prerequisite to sense a variety of stimuli and link them to different signaling partners. Such high plasticity to interact with an important range of signaling partners, representing a challenge for structure determination. Our research interest is to understand the structural basis of the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) signal transduction and their allosteric modulation. Our group already solved the V2R active structures in complex with either G proteins or arrestin. We are now working on solving the inactive state of the V2R in complex with an antagonist, the mambaquaretin-1. The last is a toxin that fully inactivate the V2R signaling. By comparing the active and inactive structures at high-resolution, we will decipher the different conformational changes leading to various signal transduction. The goal is to rationally design, on a structural basis, new selective ligands with potential therapeutic value.","4720":"Single chain polymeric nanoparticles (SCPNs) formed from amphiphilic heterograft polymers are versatile platforms in biomedicine as drug delivery vehicles, sensors or for imaging. We are developing SCPNs as bio-orthogonal catalysts for catalysis in vitro en-route to in situ drug synthesis for cancer therapies and reduced side effects. We developed transition metal loaded nanometre-sized polymeric nanoparticles loaded with Pd, Cu, or Rh-based catalysts, for specific reactions in water and bio-media. We are currently studying the structure-activity relationships both at ensemble and single molecule level, on amphiphilic polymers with variations in hydrophobic, hydrophilic and supramolecular grafts content. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the size, shape, and compactness of these catalytic nanoparticles in order to understand the influence of their microstructure on the catalytic activity.

Each project is evaluated on its feasibility before being incorporated in the crystallization pipeline. PTPSP goal is to create a dynamic and efficient platform to move projects  forward, and collecting data at ESRF is therefore essential to our community. For many years, PTPSP has long-term proposals at SLS (PSI, Switzerland), however with SLS closing mid-2023 for an upgrade, PTPSP would need beamtime at ESRF during that period","4722":"In this work, we investigate whether microemulsions may be employed as delivery systems of AMPs. Specifically, we investigate (i) structural parameters of microemulsions believed to affect skin permeation, e.g. through tight junctions in the stratum corneum, and (ii) interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic AMPs and microemulsions. Results from SAXS measurements are combined with data from cryo-TEM, skin permeation studies, and bacterial killing assays. In doing so, we aim at elucidating whether AMPs affect microemulsion structure, and how this may depend on properties of both microemulsion and AMP, and subsequently if structural parameters can be associated with skin permeation and antimicrobial effects in the skin.","4723":"The Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) provides Macromolecular Crystallography support to our CAT members from eight Universities in the USA, including Northwestern University, University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Michigan State University, University Wisconsin, Vanderbilt University, and University of Illinois at Chicago, and also to General Users.

Secondly, we utilize structural insights to guide target selection and development of lead compounds for drug development. Fundamental insights obtained into biological processes are often closely coupled to target identification and development of tools, reagents, or inhibitors, which feed into a range of biomedical applications. Our research relies heavily on high quality, reliable and tunable synchrotron radiation, along with state-of-the-art optics, detectors, sample changers, and computation, to support determination of new structures, as well as collect high resolution diffraction data to provide the level of accuracy important in structure-guided drug design.","4730":"The ISMB spans Birkbeck and UCL with researchers in the core Departments at Birkbeck Biological Sciences and several UCL Research Departments.\r\nResearch groups from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and Kingston University (KU) are joint co-applicants as they have strong links and collaborations with groups from ISMB.

Furthermore, we are interested in plant-pathogen interactions and the function of nucleotide derived signalling molecules in cellular stress physiology and organization. A 200 keV cryo-electron microscope was recently installed at the UMR to complement our efforts to structurally characterize macromolecular complexes, which do not readily crystallize.

For this, PAC protein was produced, purified and characterized. Structural changes around the FMN chromophore could be elucidated using time-resolved crystallography (TRX). However, structural changes happening in the AC domain could not be observed using crystallographic techniques as the crystal packing is preventing them. We suspect a bigger conformational change is required to activate the AC domain, which could be confirmed using SAXS.

Photoswitchable ligands offer the possibility to explore the conformational dynamics of GPCRs activation mechanisms. We will combine GPCR photoswitchable ligand and time-resolved X-ray crystallography to decipher light-induced 7TM conformational changes and side-chain motions that define the structural basis of GPCR activity.

Studies will be conducted to assess specific and global X-ray radiation damage at the unprecedented flux densities ID29 will deliver. TR-SSX will then be applied to several enzymes and light-sensitive proteins to study structural changes on the micro- to millisecond time-scale following reaction triggering.

Phytochromes are light regulated enzymes where both light perception and enzymatic activity reside on the same polypeptide chain. The light signal is transduced from a central chromophore through about 150 \u00c5 to the enzymatic domain.

We will combine in this BAG research interests from groups from CFEL and EuXFEL, that span from methods development for pink beam SSX data processing and sample delivery to usage of the beamline to gain insights in the structure and dynamics of biological targets. On the methods development side, the Hamburg team pioneered both SSX with experiments at PETRAIII and pink beam SSX (PBSX), first at BioCARS (APS) and soon after at beamline ID-9 of ESRF.

Our goal is to resolve the structure of the full length VSV G (i.e. with its transmembrane domain and intraviral part) in several conformations using cryoEM. This will lead to a better insight into the mechanism of membrane fusion. VSV G is the most used viral glycoprotein to deliver a cargo to a cell of interest (especially when using pseudotyped lentiviral vectors); this study will also open perspectives in the field of biotechnologies with interesting applications in oncotherapy.","4791":"This study focuses on Histatins, a family of saliva proteins that act as a first line of defence of our innate immune system and possess antiviral\/antimicrobial\/antifungal properties.

This\r\nstudy aims to understand why Hst5 has a greater killing efficacy for fungi and microbes and less for Influenza Virus A, while the opposite relationship prevails for Hst1 and Hst3. We will learn about the distribution of oligomers\/complexes, their structure, size, and shape, and the intra-complex\/oligomers' distances.

Paradoxically, Ku protein binds telomere DNA ends and contributes to their protection. But Ku is also an essential actor of the NHEJ double strand break repair pathway and it can facilitate NHEJ-dependent fusions between telomeres. Our aim is to unravel the molecular mechanisms played by telomere factors Rap1, Rif2 and Sir4 to protect telomeres against the action of the DNA repair factor Ku. We have obtained a first structure of scKu-DNA-scRap1 complex using a glacios of Institut Pasteur and Cryosparc reconstruction, but to improve the resolution we have prepared new grids after purification of complex on a gel filtration column and we would like use the Titan Krios of ERSF to collect a new serial images. ","4795":"The [FeFe]-hydrogenase PbHydA from Paraclostridium bifermentans shows both very high reactivity towards H2 production and an oxygen protected inactive conformation, which can be completely reversed to the active state. To understand the molecular basis of this high oxygen tolerance we need to resolve the 3D structure of the enzyme.\r\nWe were able to produce the enzyme in this oxygen tolerant state at high purity and in high enough yields to begin structural work. As it forms stable tetramers, the overall size (300kDa) is in the target range for SPA analysis.\r\nWe apply for access to the SOS SPA pipeline based on previous encouraging results during the CryoEM Workshop in May 2023.\r\n","4796":"This research is a continuation of previous investigations (MX-2517) and aims to further explore the impact of high pressure on the structure of glucose\/xylose isomerase (XI), a homotetrameric protein with industrial significance. By conducting experiments using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) at pressures up to 600 MPa, we aim first to test this experimental setup (at 4 bunch mode) as well as to deepen our understanding of how pressure influences the stability of this protein, cavities size, and global conformational changes. The findings from this study will build upon existing knowledge in the field of macromolecular studies under extreme conditions and contribute to advancing our understanding of high-pressure protein crystallography, particularly in the context of industrial applications.","4797":"Bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) are the most abundant organisms on earth. In order to replicate, bacteriophages hijack and eventually kill bacteria, making them a potential useful tool to treat bacterial infection. They contain the biggest diversity of modified nucleobases observed in nature so far, that prevent them from cleavage by host restriction endonucleases. However, this modified alphabet of nucleobases can make the genome of such bacteriophages resistant to sequencing by commercial polymerases. \r\n\tThe discovery of a polymerase capable of reading any type of modified genomic DNA would be a great tool for the knowledge of this hidden viral world. Recently, the bacteriophage YERA41, that infects Yersinia ruckeri bacteria, was isolated. It appears to be an unconventional phage that contains hypermodified thymidine in its genomic DNA, that only the phage DNA polymerase (DNAP) can replicate. ","4798":"Surfactants manufacturers are actively working on replacing, partially or totally, synthetic oil-based surfactants with biobased surfactants (BS) in consumer goods, for BS are established as being less toxic, with better environmental compatibility and produced from renewable feedstock. However, home and personal care products still require surfactants formulation, optimized to obtain high-performance products. A fundamental understanding in the self-assembly properties of blends of biosurfactants with industrial surfactants is then necessary. In this proposal, we use a high throughput SAXS beamline to study the phase diagram in water under diluted conditions (< 5 wt%) for mixtures of biosurfactants (sophoro-, rhamno-, cellobiose-, gluco-lipids) with industrial surfactants, negative\/positive\/neutral (SDS, LAS, CTAB, Pluronic P123, F127). This study will be essential for understanding BS\/surfactant blends and sketch their use in commercial formulations in the field of personal care.","4799":"Microtubules play crucial roles in cellular processes. They alternate between phases of growth and shrinkage, described as dynamic instability essential to their activity. In neurons, dynamic and stable microtubules co-exist but the mechanisms underlying this stability still remain unclear. Recently, MAP6 was described as the first mammalian neuronal microtubule intraluminal protein that confers strong stability to microtubules. Based on sequence similarities, we identified the neuronal specific paralog of MAP6 which is MAP6d1. We found that MAP6d1 promotes rescues and reduces growth\/shrinkage rates leading to the microtubules entering the pause phase. Surprisingly, MAP6d1 is also directly involved in the formation of microtubule doublets. As MAP6d1 is exclusively present in the neurons with motile cilia whose cytoskeletal arrangement includes microtubule doublets. Our objective is to solve the structure of MAP6d1 induced-microtubule doublets using cryo-electron tomography.","4800":"Protein synthesis or translation, takes place on the ribosome. However, due to various stresses stalling of the ribosomes does often occur on mRNAs devoid of a terminating stop codon. All bacteria share a common unique biological mechanism for rescuing stalled ribosomes on a non-stop mRNA, called trans-translation and based on the transfer \u2013 messenger RNA (tmRNA) and the protein SmpB.  Our precedent cryo-EM studies has already revealed the molecular basis of this mechanism in Escherichia coli. However, no one has yet clarified how tmRNA \u2013 SmpB intervenes on the ribosome during trans-translation on pathogenic bacteria. The proposed project aims at studying the molecular interactions between tmRNA-SmpB complexes and stalled ribosomes in six ESKAPE pathogens. This deep structural understanding of trans-translation in each ESKAPE pathogens will clarify the molecular basis for the specificity in trans-translation and help with the development of new antibiotics.","4801":"A recent proteomic study identified Nucleocapsid protein (Np) of SARS-CoV-2 as a potential interactor of RNA helicase UPF1: the key player of NMD (a cellular mechanism involved in Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay). The direct interaction and its physiological, structural and biochemical implications are unknown.We recently produced recombinant human UPF1 and SARS-CoV-2 Np proteins and demonstrated their direct interaction in vitro.Our present goad is to solve by SPA cryo-EM the structure of UPF1\/Np complex with or without RNA substrate and determine the role of this interaction for viral replication. Overall this project aims at shedding new light on the interplay between NMD and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, the structural information gathered on the Np\/UPF1 complex will pave the way for the identification of structure-based novel therapeutic strategies. \r\n","4802":"In Israel, the cryo-EM SPR community is rapidly expanding with the established facility at the Weizmann Institute (Krios, since 2019), a new facility at Ben-Gurion University (Glacios), and an upcoming one at the Hebrew University (likely Glacios), leading to a sharp increase in cryo-EM projects undertaken by Israeli researchers.

While synthetic chemistry lacks suitable catalysts to functionalize carbon dioxide in mild reaction conditions, autotrophs do it constantly, and thus there is increasing interest in exploiting the CO2-fixation mechanisms offered by nature. In this exchange proposal, we propose fast time-resolved structural-dynamics studies of one of the fastest CO2-fixation enzymes, enoyl-CoA carboxylase\/reductase (ECR), using ambient temperature serial X-ray crystallography on Beamline ID29, ESRF, which achieves 10\u03bcs resolution.

Our microfluidic chips for TR-SMX will enable rapid sequential data collection from hydrated microcrystals at room temperature under optimized, protein-specific conditions.

We are having more projects that utilize the ESRF single crystal capabilities as well as the continuous increase in SAXS time. As mentioned last year It is not trivial to provide a summary that covers all research topics encompassed by the BAG.  We expect some BAG members to resume using ESRF after utilizing other facilities.  As much as we appreciate the immense capacities of ESRF, the majority of BAG members are discontent (to say the least) regarding the post-shutdown\/Covid-19 travel regulations imposed by the management.  It seems that bureaucracy rather than common sense is prevailing and an accompanying letter will be submitted adjoined to the proposal\/report.

SBCF is based on two pillars - cryo-EM and macromolecular crystallography. The later being conducted with the use of state-of-art beamlines at European synchrotron radiation sources. Since 2019 SBCF assisted in over 55 peer-reviewed publications.

Whereas some real structural work could be carried out on Glacios microscopes, for difficult samples the use of a krios is indispensable (heterogeneous sample or limited concentration requiring a large number of images; small protein etc). Only these samples will be selected for Krios time at the BAG level.","4820":"This proposal gathers Principal investigators from Institutions across France that use cryoEM to unravel the molecular mechanisms associated with different fundamental biological processes. Scientists belong to 10 centres that currently use CM01 for cryoEM. All the PIs in this application were part of the previous BAG MX2441, with one new member who has previously submitted samples to CM01 via rolling access. For this reason, and due to more regular use of microscope time from current users we have asked for a moderate increase in the number of shifts ( from 42 to 50).\r\nAccording to our listing, over 18 projects are ready for data collection at ESRF CM01. Projects include the study of bacterial secretion systems (Bordeaux, Lyon, Paris), viruses and their infection mechanisms (Marseille), translation and its control (Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris, Strasbourg), transcription (Strasbourg, Paris), cancer (Paris, Bordeaux, Toulouse) and macromolecular transport (Bordeaux, Lyon, Strasbourg).","4821":"This BAG application builds on the development of single particle cryoEM in the Italian Structural Biology community, as in Italy there is no top-end instrument is open to rhe structural biology community.\r\nThe groups in this application have acquired know-how in cryoEM through international collaborations or by acquiring medium-level in-house equipment. Access to\r\nthe CM01 beamline at the ESRF since August 2020 has allowed the development of projects from groups that do not have in-house equipment that resulted in paper in publication on Nucleic Acid Research NAR.\r\nWe now have four screening microscopes in Italy and three more are being funded, making the access to CM01 more demanded and relevant for high-resolution data and, consequently high profile publications.","4822":"The Iberian cryoEM BAG is a large consortium (~40 groups) composed of Portuguese and Spanish laboratories working in biologically relevant problems including disease related metabolic enzymes, antibiotic resistance, DNA replication and DNA maintenance, protein synthesis, virus structure and its replication\/transcription mechanisms, and macromolecular complexes involved in the control of key cellular processes like protein folding and degradation. For these research groups electron cryomicroscopy is a fundamental tool and access to ESRF facilities is essential to achieve their objectives.","4823":" The Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) provides Macromolecular Crystallography support to our CAT members from eight Universities in the USA, including Northwestern University, University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Michigan State University, University Wisconsin, Vanderbilt University, and University of Illinois at Chicago, and also to General Users.

In order to go further into details of all these studies, access to ESRF facilities is a requirement.","4829":"The Dundee\/St Andrews\/Glasgow\/Aberdeen BAG research interests fall into two broad areas. Firstly, we use structural information to understand mechanisms of fundamental biological processes, protein engineering, enzymes, and biological chemistry. Secondly, we utilize structural insights to guide target selection and development of lead compounds for drug development. Fundamental insights obtained into biological processes are often closely coupled to target identification and development of tools, reagents, or inhibitors, which feed into a range of biomedical applications. Our research relies heavily on high quality and reliable synchrotron radiation, along with state-of-the-art optics, detectors, sample changers, and computation, to support determination of new structures, as well as collect high resolution diffraction data to provide the level of accuracy important in structure-guided drug design.","4830":"The ISMB spans Birkbeck and UCL with researchers in the core Departments at Birkbeck Biological Sciences and several UCL Research Departments. Research groups from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and Kingston University (KU) are joint co-applicants as they have strong links and collaborations with groups from ISMB. All groups share common interests in disciplines including structural, chemical, molecular and cell biology; using multidisciplinary and multiscalar approaches. ISMB, UCL, QMUL and KU investigators, ranging from early-career research fellows to internationally-established senior academics, apply X-ray crystallography carried out mainly at our Wellcome funded facility at Birkbeck, as an essential method enabling: i) description of the atomiclevel mechanistic details of macromolecules and macromolecular machines, and ii) structure-based drug discovery, while iii) complementing and supporting cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) projects.","4831":"The HeidelBAG unifies structural efforts of EMBL Heidelberg and the Heidelberg University Biochemistry Center (BZH). Central to all projects are large assemblies involved in chromosome organization and transcription control, in nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA regulation, in translational control by ribosome associated factors, in protein targeting and membrane protein insertion, or in post-translational and RNA modification and processing. Nearly all projects make use of integrated structural biology techniques (MX, SAXS\/SANS, NMR, cryo-EM) combined with complementary biophysical and AI approaches. MX remains the essential and invariant tool for high resolution information of challenging functional modules. More and more pathological implications of the studied crucial cellular processes come into focus. In the 1st year of the continued proposal, the BAG reports on 8 publications and 25 PDB entries and many unpublished results. ","4832":"The BAG groups 10 teams from 6 Marseille laboratories. Mutual understanding amongst all PIs provides a solid base for efficient organization of the BAG. Research revolves around infection, health and biotechnology. For the next beam time allocation period (6 months) we could make efficient use of 12 MX and 2 SAXS shifts. Three teams combine structural biology with medicinal chemistry and beam time at MASSIF for large ligand-screening campaigns will mostly suit their purpose. Access to beamlines with tunable energy will be instrumental for projects requiring experimental phasing. One team uses exclusively Bio-SAXS. Allocation of one shift per session would be welcomed. Remote access for MX sessions has become very popular whereas scientists prefer to be on-site for Bio-SAXS experiments. ","4833":"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA, plays a crucial role in numerous biological processes. m6A reader proteins, which recognize and interpret these modifications, serve as key mediators in epitranscriptomic regulation. \r\nUsing computational modeling, structure-based drug design, and high-throughput screening techniques we have identified lead compounds against the modulators of m6A. With this proposal we aim to further develop our lead compounds into highly potent and selective chemical probes targeting the nuclear m6A-mRNA reader protein YTHDC1. These chemical probes illuminate protein-RNA interactions, revealing epitranscriptomic regulation mechanisms. By manipulating m6A reader proteins, they enable targeted therapies for diseases driven by dysregulated epitranscriptomic processes.\r\n","4834":"To transcribe and replicate their genome, mononegaviruses use a sophisticated RNA synthesis machinery made of a polymerase complex and a ribonucleoprotein template. Structural information on how these two components assemble to form a functional transcription complex is lacking. The objective is to decipher the molecular architecture of the transcription complex of vesicular stomatitis virus using cryo-electron tomography. It will provide the first structural information on the full transcription complex of a mononegavirus and new insight into the molecular mechanisms used by these viruses to transcribe their genome. This is an application to the \u201cSolution to Structure\u201d pipeline.","4835":"The vast majority of bacteriophages (phages) - bacterial viruses - present a tail that allows host recognition, cell wall perforation and safe channelling of the viral DNA from the capsid to the cytoplasm of the infected bacterium. The majority of tailed phages bears a long flexible tail (Siphoviridae) at the distal end of which a tip complex, often called baseplate, harbours one or more Receptor Binding Protein\u00b7s (RBPs). Interaction between the RBPs and the host surface triggers cell wall perforation and DNA ejection, but little is known on these mechanisms for Siphoviridae1. After preliminary data obtained by cryo-electron tomography on phage T5 upon interaction with FhuA reconstituted into liposomes, we now aim to study the channel formed by phage T5 upon interaction with E. coli mini-skinny cells, by cryo-electron tomography. Subtomogram averaging should shed light on the structure of the channel and the nature of host interacting partners. ","4837":"The aim of this research project is to determine the influence of synchrotron radiation on the induction of radiation damage in selected model protein structures in the presence of copper, zinc and other divalent metal ions. Human serum albumin (HSA) and human cystatin C (HCC) were selected as model systems, which were previously examined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in complexes mainly with Cu(II) and Zn(II) cations. The analysis using the bioSAXS technique will determine potential structural changes and correlates them with radiation damages visible in XAS studies.","4838":"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are Class C GPCRs. They are obligate dimers, dimerization being fundamental for their function. mGluRs are activated by the binding of the main excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, within an extracellular domain (ECD). Conformational changes induced by glutamate-binding are then transmitted to the transmembrane domain composed of 7 transmembrane helices (7TM) that allows signal transduction within the cell. Class C GPCR activity can be modulated by the binding of Positive Allosteric Modulators (PAM) or Negative Allosteric Modulators (NAM) to the 7TM. Our research interest is to understand the structural basis of class C GPCR dimers signal transduction and their allosteric regulation. Multiple structures of PAM bound receptor will be solved and they will provide a comprehensive understanding on the nature of ligand binding in the 7TM as well as conformational changes associated to the binding of PAM at the mGlu receptor.","4839":"Protein synthesis or translation, takes place on the ribosome. However, due to various stresses stalling of the ribosomes does often occur on mRNAs devoid of a terminating stop codon. All bacteria share a common unique biological mechanism for rescuing stalled ribosomes on a non-stop mRNA, called trans-translation and based on the transfer \u2013 messenger RNA (tmRNA) and the protein SmpB. Our precedent cryo-EM studies has already revealed the molecular basis of this mechanism in Escherichia coli. However, no one has yet clarified how tmRNA \u2013 SmpB intervenes on the ribosome during trans-translation on pathogenic bacteria. The proposed project aims at studying the molecular interactions between tmRNA-SmpB complexes and stalled ribosomes in six ESKAPE pathogens. This deep structural understanding of trans-translation in each ESKAPE pathogens will clarify the molecular basis for the specificity in trans-translation and help with the development of new antibiotics.","4840":"The aim of our project is to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the prominent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway, the NHEJ (non-homologous end joining). No repaired DSBs can led to cell death, chromosomal aberration or immunodeficiency syndromes. NHEJ starts with DSB recognition by the heterodimeric protein Ku that recruits the processing factors (nucleases, polymerases) and the ligase complex to end with DNA ligation (Zahid et al 2021).\r\nWe are mainly focus on the structural studies of long-range to short-range synaptic transition in S. cerevisiae NHEJ, as a model of study. An additional aim to unveil the architecture of key DNA-protein complexes involved in this budding yeast NHEJ is to compare it with the human system Chaplin et al 2021, Nemoz et al 2018)from an evolutionary point of view. \r\n","4841":"MICALs form a family of mainly cytosolic multidomain enzymes that control actin cytoskeleton dynamics. They are peculiar actin-binding proteins as they cause F-actin depolymerisation by oxidation of actin residues thanks to the H2O2-producing NADPH oxidase activity of the N-terminal flavoprotein domain, which is enhanced in the MICAL-F-actin complex. The catalytic domain is followed by several domains, responsible of the control of the activity upon interaction with regulating small molecules and proteins. MICALs participate in cell differentiation, migration, division, vesicle trafficking and even gene expression through their actin depolymerising activity or H2O2 production leading to oxidation of largely unknown target proteins. Elucidating the 3D structure of MICAL1 by cryoEM, will clarify the hypothesised peculiar mode of regulation of the activity, and will be key to devise ways to modulate the enzyme activity in the context of diseases like cancer and neurological disorders.","4842":"Although considered as the most toxic DNA lesion, programmed DSBs (prDSBs) are essential for a number of physiological processes such as T and B cell development, meiosis, transcription and replication. prDSBs require tight coordination between DNA cleavage and DSB repair. To unravel this close collaboration we use the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia. Indeed, during its new polyploidy macronucleus (MAC) development, the Piggy-Mac transposase and its partners, PiggyMac-Like (PgmL1 to PgmL5) excise DNA at specific DNA sequence. The prDSBs generated are then repaired by the Non-Homologous End Joining Pathway. Our collaborators have recently shown that the PgmL1 and PgmL3 are the first factors to step in the recognition of the specific DNA sequences. Thus, the major aim of this proposal is to characterize the structural functions of PgmL1 and PgmL3 in presence or not of DNA molecule by cryoEM.","4843":"The aim of this research is to solve a first high-resolution structure of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in complex with a Staphylococcus aureus (SA) pore forming toxin component, namely \u03b3 hemolysin A (HlgA). We have obtained complexes of monomeric HlgA and atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1), which represent the initial molecular step leading to the formation of transmembrane pores that are able to lyse human red blood cells (which express ACKR1). This work will provide a structural basis to understand how pathogenic SA bacteria hijack human GPCRs, and help design potential inhibitors or anti-SA vaccines.","4844":"PLGA-NPs represent a promising class of nanomaterials with versatile applications in the fields of drug delivery, biomedicine, and biotechnology. The biodegradability, biocompatibility, and tuneable drug release kinetics of PLGA-NPs make them attractive candidates for drug encapsulation and delivery systems. However, one of the main obstacles for using NPs as drug carriers in clinical settings is the uncertainty about how they interact with proteins in the blood. These interactions can indeed modify both the behaviour of NPs, in terms of their efficacy in drug delivery and safety, and the functionality of the interacting proteins. In this project, we propose to investigate, with synchrotron Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering, the structure of different types of PLGA-NPs in the presence of different amounts of BSA. As a result, we will obtain information on the protein corona as well as on the dissociation constant and the Hill cooperative index that rule the NP-BSA interaction.","4845":"This proposal outlines the application of in-solution synchrotron SAXS to investigate HSPB8, an intrinsically disordered protein acting as a chaperone in protein folding and aggregation prevention. The primary objective is to elucidate the biophysical changes induced by the pathogenic mutant K141E on the stability and function of HSPB8. SAXS experiments will be conducted under different conditions for both the wild type and the pathogenic mutant, including temperature, ionic strength, and concentration of paroxetine, an  antidepressant drug. The collected SAXS data will be analyzed with the variational Bayesian method (VBWSAS) aimed to re-weight the ensemble of conformers derived from enhanced sampling atomistic simulations. The integration of SAXS data with computational simulations will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural alterations associated with HSPB8 mutations and the effect of drugs shown to restore the chaperone activity of the mutant protein.

It combines groups working on different topics with a major focus on cell signaling proteins, drug discovery, long non-coding RNAs, nucleic acid-protein complexes, and host-pathogen interactions. The proposers have long-standing experience in the use, as well as the development of beam lines for macromolecular crystallography and biological small angle X-ray scattering and have participated in successive BAG applications over the years, mostly at the ESRF but also at other synchrotrons. The BAG responsible is  Andrew McCarthy (EMBL Grenoble) for this application round.","4871":"Within this BAG proposal we aim to investigate the structure-function relationships of various soluble and membrane proteins in ground and intermediate states that are involved in signal transduction processes and\/or enzymatic substrate conversion. In photosensitive proteins such as phytochromes and DNA photolyases we want to visualize in detail the different intermediates of their photocycle or changes after defined light exposure and thereby improve the understanding of their signalling mechanisms. Light-activated rhodopsins are found in all three domains of life and serve as a link to convert solar energy into biological functions such as signal transduction, ion transport and modulation of enzyme activity\r\nHere we investigate wild-type and mutant variants of eukaryotic and microbial rhodopsins that function as ion\/proton pumps at the structural level.

The laboratories take advantage of single crystal and small angle X-ray diffraction methods to study the structure-function relationships in various macromolecules. A unifying factor for the clear majority of the macromolecules under study is their relationship to human health, either directly, being human proteins involved in some disease, or indirectly, as proteins expressed by human pathogens and validated as potential pharmacological targets. Other projects investigate basic chemical processes, the study of plant viral proteins, or aim at characterising macromolecules with potential biotechnological applications including drug delivery.\r\n","4874":"This proposal is a collaborative effort of the Structural Biology Groups of Madrid with the objective to form a strong core of scientist devoted to this area of\r\nresearch in Spain. It is composed of 21 groups distributed in 4 research Institutes.","4875":"The project aims to elucidate the 3D organization of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) amyloids. These fibrils responsible for the onset of Isolated Atrial Amyloidosis (IAA), a localized form of cardiac amyloidosis primarily affecting the heart atria.\r\nIAA is characterized by the deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in the atrial tissue of ANP, a hormone synthesized by the atria. ANP fibrils lead to the disruption of tissue architecture and electrical conduction. Structural information on the architecture of ANP fibrils is lacking, hindering a deep understanding of their interaction with the environment and the mechanisms leading to the formation of the fibrillar structures.\r\nAdvancements in helical reconstruction procedures in cryo-EM and in extraction techniques of ex-vivo amyloid fibrils offer opportunities to explore the structural characteristics of amyloids. This research could pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions and improved diagnostic strategies for IAA.\r\n\r\n","4876":"Single chain nanoparticles are polymeric nanoparticles made from intramolecular cross-linking of individual chains, which can also be made of polypeptides or proteins. Here, we propose to study the structure of SCNPs based on the enzyme \u03b1-Amylase denatured in urea solutions and collapsed via intra-molecular crosslinking. The enzymatic activity is supressed upon denaturation, whereas internal cross-linking recovers part of this activity. This proposal aims to perform a detailed structural characterization by SAXS of the enzyme and their SCNPs to compare with the enzymatic activity.  ","4877":"By mimicking Nature's ability to control biomolecular association, artificial systems can be developed to design higher order structures through supramolecular interactions. Here, we will explore the formation of supramolecular assemblies through the interactions of helical peptides functionalised with non-canonical side chains. Our preliminary results show that different oligomerisation states can be selectively achieved by altering the structure of those side chains. As such, these design motifs can modulate assembly formation, from small oligomers (e.g., dimer, trimer) to higher order structures (e.g., octamer, decamer), as well as the populations of those as discrete oligomers (e.g., 100% pentamer) to co-existing structures (e.g., varied populations of monomer, trimer and pentamer). The proposed experiment aims to provide a detailed picture of the assembly modes, which will aid to develop a general mechanism of peptide association.","4878":"Nature is known to form a variety of complex silica-based architectures with exquisite structural control. Among them are the glass spicules in marine sponges that exhibit a diversity of highly regular three-dimensional branched morphologies, which are a paradigm example of symmetry in biological systems. During spicule formation, the process of silica formation and deposition is templated by organic filaments that are composed of proteins, called silicateins, which are arranged in a mesoscopic single crystal-like structure. The topic of this proposal is the study of the silicatein crystal polymorphism in-situ, inside the biomineralized amorphous glass tissue.","4879":"Members of the photolyase-cryptochrome superfamily (PCSF) utilise transient electron transfer (ET) for diverse reactions including light-driven DNA repair, and photo- and magnetoreception. As such, they represent a ubiquitous and central class of enzymes which has attracted an enormous amount of attention. Over the last years\u2060, our group has specialised in the time-resolved crystallographic characterisation of these reactions, with one exception: repair of (6-4) Photoproduct (64PP) DNA lesions via (6-4)Photolyases. With the current proposal, we aim to employ Time-resolved serial oscillation crystallography (TR-SOX) techniques to structurally characterise this reaction for the first time.","4880":"Pentiptycene-anthracene (PAn-OCn) crystals are an ideal platform for delving into the fundamental aspects of in crystallo photochemical processes due to their light-driven [4+4] cycloadditive chemistry. In our previous experiments at the ESRF we used the unusual setup at the FIP2 (BM07) beamline, where an online microspectrophotometer is built perpendicularly to the X-ray beamline, to conduct simultaneous fluorescence and X-ray diffraction experiments with a time-resolution of ~30 seconds. From these, and based on a variety of analytical techniques, we observed the structural\/kinetic features of PAn-OCn chemistry. Most importantly, our data suggested the presence of a reaction intermediate, which, due to low occupancy and short life-time, we could not structurally characterize. Thus, we propose to repeat our PAn-Ocn experiments at the ESRF at a higher time-resolution to determine the nature of the reaction intermediate.","4881":"We have recently shown that the MAP6d1 protein is the first neuronal protein able to form microtubule doublet structures in vitro. In agreement with the in vitro data, we observed that in neurons, MAP6d1 colocalises with the basal body and the proximal segment of the primary cilia where microtubule doublets are specifically present (article in preparation). Another striking structural feature of microtubules polymerized in vitro by MAP6d1 are microtubules with luminal protofilaments which have never been described before. The aim of this proposal is to explore the whole microtubule architecture of murine neurons by collecting high resolution cryo-ET data from neurons grown on microscopy grids and investigate whether microtubule doublets are present in other compartments than cilia and where microtubules with inner protofilaments are observed in neurons.","4882":"CLIMP-63 (cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63) is a key player in the formation of the correct endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure. It has been shown that in the ER, CLIMP-63 assembles into trimeric units and higher order super-stable structures that are S-acylated. We have expressed and purified several truncated constructs of CLIMP-63 from several species that lack the transmembrane domain. This soluble ER luminal domain (monomer mass ~58kDa) behaves as a trimer in vitro (shown by MALS and mass photometry analysis), most likely forming a parallel coiled-coil. While crystallisation experiments are set up, we would like to study the conformation of these CLIMP-63 variants in solution using SEC-SAXS. Structural information obtained by SAXS, in combination with our biophysical studies, would be very useful to validate the 3D models and assess the sample heterogeneity and suitability to perform further crystallographic and cryo-EM experiments. ","4883":"Human MICAL1 belongs to the MICAL family of multidomain enzymes that control actin cytoskeleton dynamics and related processes through their F-actin depolymerising activity. The latter is due to the NADPH-dependent H2O2-producing reaction of the N-terminal FAD-containing catalytic domain, consisting of reduction of the flavin (FAD) coenzyme by NADPH followed by reduction of O2 and oxidation of target proteins with regeneration of the oxidised coenzyme. The catalytic domain is  followed by  regulatory domains that lead to an autoinhibited MICAL1 form in the free \u201cas isolated\u201d state. Thanks to the first data collection session at ESRF CM01 (MX2618) we obtained a reconstruction at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution and built a model of full-length MICAL1 in the \u201cclosed\u201d autoinhibited oxidised form. To clarify the mechanism of autoregulation of the activity we now wish to tackle the structural characterization  of the NADPH-reduced enzyme.  ","4884":"Within the proposed experiment, we aim to collect monochromatic and anomalous crystallographic data on ligand-free and ligand-bound protein targets. First, we will focus on staphylokinase (SAK), a pharmacologically attractive indirect plasminogen activator protein of bacterial origin that forms stoichiometric noncovalent complexes with plasmin, promoting the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin. We will probe biocrystals of a non-immunogenic SAK, which we recently prepared in our lab. Moreover, we will aim to collect data on Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) isoform, which is a key player in the neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we aim at dissecting the molecular mechanism of ApoE oligomerization, that leads to pathological aggregates frequently found in brains of AD patients.Finally, we will probe crystals of a newly discovered FYY protein (iso-penicillin N-sythase-like dioxygenase), which is a  precursor for biosynthesis of a high-energy marine luciferin - coelenterazine.","4885":"Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven to be a superior vehicle for the delivery of genetic material like RNA, also known as the basis for the COVID-19 vaccine. Much work has already been done on LNPs to understand their fundamentals and to identify optimal lipid compositions. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of stereoisomers of single lipid components on transport efficiency and targeting properties of LNPs. We recently explored lipid stereoisomers, finding that isomeric differences can increase the transfection efficiency by several folds and also have an influence on cell selectivity. Recent reports show that the efficiency of endosomal escape can be attributed to the internal structure of LNPs. We postulated that the different isomers influence the lipid packing and thus the internal structure. In this proposal we plan to use SAXS to gain a deeper understanding of how lipid isomers change the nanostructure and thus the properties of the resulting LNP formulations.","4886":"In the cell this regulatory code is determined by transcription factors (TFs) that recognise specific DNA sequence motifs. TFs commonly work together to form TF-TF complexes on DNA.  Even though individual interactions between TFs are often weak, the complexes formed on DNA can still be highly specific, both in terms of the TF-TF pairing, and the spacing between the individual motifs. The molecular basis of this specificity is, however, unclear. This project aims to determine the structural basis of cooperative binding of multiple transcription factors to free DNA. As models, we will use homeodomain proteins that have diverse biological roles despite binding to the same motif on free DNA. The homeodomains differ, however, in choice of TF partners such as basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. The specific aims of this research program are to:\u00a0determine the molecular basis of partner choice of canonical homeodomain proteins and to understand the structural basis of spacing preferences.","4887":"This study will focus on the Histatins (Hst), a family of saliva proteins that act as a first line of defence of our innate immune system and possess antiviral\/antimicrobial\/antifungal properties. Of specific interest are Histatin 1 (Hst1), Histatin 3 (Hst3), and Histatin 5 (Hst5). These peptides contain 38, 32, and 24 amino acids, respectively, of which the 22 first amino acids in the primary sequence are close to identical, barring a few deviations in Hst1. Here, we aim to understand from a biophysics perspective why Hst5 has a greater killing efficacy for fungi and microbes and less for a virus such as Influenza A (IAV). In contrast, the opposite relationship prevails for Hst1 and Hst3. The aim is to achieve a molecular understanding of the underlying physics and the structure-function relationship by utilizing the toolbox we have developed for more than a decade of research for Hst5, combining computer simulations and experiments. ","4888":"Biomolecular condensates are important organizers of cellular biochemistry. Understanding their structure and function can, for example, shed light on several neurodegenerative diseases. Although biomolecular condensates play such an important role, we barely understand their internal structure. So far, it is known that structures below the optical resolution limit are proposed to exist. These scales are accessible with X-rays, which are well suited to quantifying the organization of molecules through the structure factor. Here, we propose experiments at the BioSAXS BM29 beamline at the ESRF to further unravel the structure of biomolecular condensates. We hope that these experiments not only shed light on our own system, but also again demonstrate the power of X-rays to a growing community of condensate scientists.","4889":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate the structural features of polymeric micelles made of 8 novel different hydrophilic derivatives of vitamin E, to be used as nanocarriers for the delivery of neuroprotective drugs to the retina.

In this project, we aim to obtain on-demand control on the particle conformation in aqueous media via incorporation of various stimuli-responsive moieties. The resulting variations in the polymer microstructure are envisaged  to steer the particle interactions with biological surroundings such as proteins, receptors or cellular membranes. Hereto, we have developed nanometre-sized polymeric particles comprising photoswitches or H-bonding moieties and are currently investigating their structure-interaction relationship. Elucidating their size, shape and compactness is of great importance to understand the influence of the introduced stimuli responsive groups on the particle microstructure and in line their biological interactions.

Teneurin-3 is alternatively spliced at two sites, resulting in four isoforms. Previously, we reported that all these isoforms adopt completely different conformations, and two isoforms contain Arg2563Trp at intramolecular domain-domain contacts. On basis of molecular dynamics simulations, thermal stability, and cell clustering assays, we now show that specifically these two isoforms are stabilised on the molecular level, leading to loss of trans-cellualar adhesion.

Following promising preliminary cryoEM results, we aim to use high-resolution cryoEM to elucidate the molecular architecture of FAM118B filaments and their interfaces, providing insights into their structural and functional roles.

However, capturing these conformational changes, especially during catalysis, has proven difficult using conventional experimental methods. Uniquely, time-resolved X-ray crystallography (TRX) can provide insight into these dynamic changes, but is often compounded with substantial experimental challenges. To surmount these challenges and enable TRX on typical beamlines, we have pioneered cryo-trapping TRX. Our SPITROBOT crystal plunger enables to move beyond canonical static imaging of proteins and instead capture short-lived reaction intermediates, that report on dynamic biochemical processes as they unfold. Here we aim to demonstrate that the next generation plunger \u2018SPITROBOT-2\u2019 enables reaction quenching within 25 ms and allows following the dynamic events during ligand binding and catalysis for several model systems.

Since clinical trials have been recently launched to test the ability of TNAP inhibitors to block pathological calcification, the elucidation of TNAP structure, and the impact of its inhibition would be very useful. To date, only one recent study experimentally determined a 3D structure of human TNAP, but the enzyme was deglycosylated and analyzed without ligands [1]. In fact, no structural data exists for the TNAP protein in the presence of ligands (substrates, potential effectors, or inhibitors) and has never been studied by cryo-EM.","4920":"Within the proposed experiment, we aim to collect monochromatic and anomalous crystallographic data on ligand-free and ligand-bound protein targets.

This vast concentration disparity between the dense and dilute regimes poses the question: what are the protein's conformational states as the concentration increases from dilute towards dense? PGL-3 has two globular domains followed by an intrinsically disordered tail. While one of the folded domains participates in dimerization, the role of the other one and the disordered tail is unclear. We aim to obtain structural information in dilute, concentrated below phase separation, and phase separated conditions to establish the effect of salt, protein concentration and temperature on structure.","4923":"The Enoyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (InhA) is an\nessential enzyme for this pathogen's survival and the main target for Isoniazid, which is one\nof the first-line drugs used for tuberculosis treatment.

Yet, enzymes have evolved and developed numerous strategies and structural features to complete their tasks. Along an enzymatic pathway, several frequently assemble into multi-enzyme complexes for efficient transport of substrates from one active site to another using different strategies, including substrate channeling, where intermediates are directly transferred to the second active site via a tunnel, without being released into the surrounding solution. Channeling enhances the efficiency of enzymatic pathways, and prevents the release of unstable, reactive or toxic intermediates.\nIn this experiment, tryptophan synthase will be used as a model to investigate substrates channeling.

This project focusses on oil-in-water micro-swimmers, which are self-propelled droplets of liquid crystal.  Their motions are powered by the gradual transfer of oil into surfactant micelles, which then swell in size.  However, several such transport mechanisms are possible: a direct observation of the size-distribution of micelles would allow discrimination between these mechanisms, and quantification of e.g. their reaction kinetics.  Our aim is to achieve such direct measurement with SAXS of a the time-evolution of micelles in a diffusive boundary layer above a well-defined oil-water interface.

The hair-like structures appear simple, but show a striking performance in sensitivity, specificity and mechanical robustness. It is unknown how the architecture and the composition (chitin-protein) contribute to the mechanical and functional characteristics of the hair sensilla. Therefore, we apply to perform studies on two types of sensilla, namely tactile hair and flow sensitive trichobothria in C. salei. To do so we plan to scan SAXS\/XRD\/XRF at various region of two sensilla types along the hair shaft and the hair base to quantify chitin\/protein ratio, the chitin fiber orientation and the distribution of halogens like Br.

In the proposed experiment, we suggest to get closer to physiological conditions, by applying the method to hydrated cells. We will fabricate special fluid chambers and investigate MEFs expressing either healthy wild type desmin or a disease mutant of desmin (R406W) which leads to protein aggregates in the cells.

By tuning residence times, we will analyse specific timepoints for a prolonged duration, unlike traditional in-situ studies where one instantaneous measurement provides data. Furthermore, we intend to optimise the flow cell so observed timepoints can be monitored by characterising different locations on the cell. We will also use the cell to conduct accelerated kinetic studies using a transient technique in which rapid screening of residence times generated by a flow rate switch is performed. This technique requires high intensity x-rays afforded by synchrotron sources enabling short acquisition times. By identification of particle properties such as core diameter at various residence times the synthetic conditions can be altered to allow for tailoring of the produced product.

Our goal is to study the shape and size of the PIC micelles at low concentration, describe the interactions arising at intermediate concentration and characterise the mesophases formed at high concentration, and at various temperatures and pH. Particularly, we are interested in unravelling the influence of the architecture of the neutral block of the copolymer (by studying a linear neutral block or a comb-type one) and of the length of the polyelectrolyte on the shape and size of micelles, but also the type of mesophase achievable.","4996":"We want to determine the structure and stability of concentrated artificial oxygen carriers (AOC) in aqueous suspension, by combined ultra-small angle X-ray\r\nscattering (USAXS) and SAXS measurements.

Its function is poorly understood due to open questions on the molecular level organization and structure. These can be answered by studying the self-assembly of monolayers of selected TFLL lipids on an aqueous interface. Our unique lipid library containing representatives from the major TFLL lipid classes is well suited for this task. In a preselection process we have studied the surface potential and pressure profiles of different species and selected the most promising ones for GIXD and XRR studies.

These anomalies point to the possible existence of a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in Te, which is similar to the one purported in water. Compared with water, however, the ability of Te to reach deep supercooling without crystallization makes it possible to explore its phase diagram close to the LLCP. Therefore, we propose to study the structure of supercooled liquid Te under pressure at ID15B, aiming at revealing details of the phase diagram including the vicinity of the LLCP.","5016":"Solid assemblies of organic compounds often include some inevitable misfit between constituents, giving rise to geometric frustration. In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, for small enough assemblies there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favourable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In the proposed experiment, we will follow the morphological evolution and branching of slender protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also demonstrate the role of spontaneous processes in biological tissue formation.

Such nanoparticles are characterised by an atomically-defined thickness and display outstanding physical properties. Different growth mechanisms have been proposed to explain their controlled thickness, but they are still debated and no universal mechanism has been reported so far. Using time-resolved SAXS\/WAXS for In2S3 NPL, we have identified an unreported growth mechanism based on a nucleation-induced lamellar self-assembly process. Our preliminary experiments on CeF3 and CdSe wurtzite NPL suggest a similar mechanism, hinting for a universal mechanism and begging further investigation. We propose to confirm these findings by broadening the range of experimental conditions on the anisotropic growth of different material to explore in detail their growth mechanism.

","5018":"The glass transition is an out of equilibrium transition from the fluid to a disordered solid obtained at very high volume fractions. The glass transition is a dynamical arrested transition where colloids are trapped within the cage formed by their neighbors. The absence of rearrangement on long time scales leads to the solid behavior of the suspension. This transition has been well studied for hard-sphere colloids. Here, we aim to study this transition for fractal colloids, namely fumed silica dispersed in a good solvent. Preliminary results show that this system presents two originalities compared to hard-sphere colloidal systems. As the volume fraction is increased, the system viscosity diverges at low volume fraction, 30% and the colloids interpenetrate each other.

Thanks to recent advances in beamline and detector technology, and most importantly the synthesis of tracer particles with very narrow size distribution and tunable radius, precise measurements of viscosity will become possible with the required spatial and temporal resolution.

In each protocol, the target pressure will be varied to study the effect of the pressure jump length on the rate of the phase transition. These two processes (micellar collapse and swelling) will be studied on both sides of the maximum of the co-existence line, i.e., under weak and strong dehydration of the micellar shell.

We will determine the location of two important pseudo-phase boundaries that we identify as the Lifshitz line and the Widom line, in two similar ternary mixtures: water\/ethanol\/1-octanol and water\/ethanol\/2-ethyl-1-hexanol. The later is an isomer of 1-octanol, with a greater propensity for self-aggregation in the form of rings rather than chains, making it far more difficult to pack.

Flowing up on our proposal SC 5187 we suggest to extend our study of the hair sensilla of the spider, Cupiennius salei to include the effect of water on the chitin-protein structure. To do so we plan to perform SAXS\/XRD\/XRF scans on fully hydrated samples (intact hairs and cross sections). With this we will be able to elucidate the effects of water on the structure of the hair sensilla.

We will fabricate special fluid chambers and investigate keratin-rich cells expressing particularly pronounced protein bundles, as a bench mark for studying such ordered structures.","5032":"Cellulose is considered as non-melting since thermal degradation precedes melting temperature in the standard processing condition. However, when duration is short enough, physical aphase transition is considered to precede chemcial degradationWe explore the possibility of melting crystalline cellulose samples by combining ultra-fast calorimetry technique and in-situ X-ray scattering in order to understand local fast-occurring processes during phase transition. We will use the in-situ setup on ID13, which combines nanocalorimetry with nano- and microfocus X-ray scattering (the setup was designed and installed on the ID13 beamline during the LTP project SC-3898). The insights on the mechanisms of melting crystalline cellulose will help evaluating its potential for using it as a renewable material in an efficient way.","5033":"Bone toughness depends on the many interfaces joining the different structural units of bone. Among these, cement lines are thin layers separating osteons from the surrounding bone. Cement lines are still one of the least understood features of our bones; yet these structures are believed to play a key role in bone fracture resistance. The main aim of this research is to characterize the mineral properties of cement lines by small and wide angle x-ray scattering with (sub)micrometer resolution to test the hypothesis that cement lines exhibit different mineral particle size, orientation and crystallographic parameters w.r.t. surrounding bone. We assume that such difference, reflected into different biomechanical properties, provides cement lines with the ability to hamper crack propagation. Our findings shall clarify the contribution of cement lines to bone toughness and guide the design of bone-inspired composites, with a tunable fiber\/matrix interface to enhance toughness.","5034":"The aim of the present proposal is to investigate dynamics and structure of soft microgel particles composed of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks (IPN) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) dispersed in water through XPCS and SAXS. The study will be performed on an IPN microgel at high PAAc content that, in a recent rheological study [1], has revealed liquid-glass and glass-jammed transitions at increasing concentration. Moreover, the system is characterized by a volume phase transition (VPT) from a swollen to a shrunken state around T=305 K, therefore it would be interesting to probe the dynamics and structure as a function of temperature across the VPT for a microgel with high PAAc content, at high concentration. In these conditions, the VPT will be accompanied by a transition from a liquid to an arrested state and to a change in the particle softness [2].","5035":"We propose an in situ GISAXS experiment study in collaboration with Procter & Gamble UK (the partner\r\nof InnovaXN project), the world leading manufacturer in personal care products, to study the spontaneous\r\nself-assembly of novel polymer-surfactant multilayer films.

It is hypothesized that the LLT takes place in supercooled water in an experimentally inaccessible region (so-called no-man\u2019s land) because of the rapid crystallization. Here, we will explore the LLT by suppressing crystallization with the use of cryoprotected aqueous solutions. We aim to go beyond LLT structural kinetics studied previously and explore the dynamic properties with X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). Varying the concentration and composition of the solutions allows us to explore different parts of the state diagram.

This model system can capture essential steps and structural mechanisms of vesicle adhesion to a membrane, e.g. like interaction range, contact area, adhesion state, lateral correlation in adhering SVs, as well as structural changes of the bilayer induced by adhering vesicles. For the first time, this assay will also address the pivotal role of the protein synapsin.","5041":"We will use X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to reveal the reversible dynamics of the light-soaking domains in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. These domains appear due to light-induced segregation of iodide and bromide ions in MAPb(I\/Br)3 films and are characterized by different band gaps and slightly different crystal structures. Using the scattering of coherent X-rays in Bragg geometry, we will characterize the size of the iodine-rich and bromide-rich domains and obtain a characteristic time scale of their formation. This information will help to improve the stability of the perovskite-based solar cells.

The motivation of this work is to find the reason behind the ferromagnetism in the single-atom (e.g. Fe, Co,\r\nNi, and Cu) doped TiO2, an unexpected property with no bulk analogue. These XES\/RIXS measurements can uniquely\r\ndetermine whether the observed magnetization is due to a magnetic moment from one of the constituent elements, or\r\ntheir orbital hybridization.","5043":"We will study topological defects in smectic liquid crystals at the scale of a single defect or a very small number of defects, using nano-diffraction on a thin film (8CB smectic liquid crystal) made of topological defects  oriented by a rubbed polymer substrate. The aim will be to study defect core structures and elastic distortions around the core at a scale that is still poorly understood for liquid crystal materials. We will also study how these structures evolve when approaching the transition to nematic phase or when nanoparticles are confined and organised within the core of these defects. We will scan in 1D, perpendicular to the oriented defects, both in GISAXS (reflection) and in TSAXS (transmission) to allow at each point for a full reconstruction of the smectic layer distortion and topological defects determination.

We hypothesize that the orientation of the nanostructure reflects the spiral macrostructure, defining its mechanical properties. Previous experiments have shown microstructure with a high anisotropy in the tusk direction with helical deviations from the tusk axis, however, the small sample size restricted the ability to connect the macrostructure to the local features investigated. How the organization of the nanostructure connects to these macroscopic features can only be done by probing the nanostructure through scattering in macroscopic samples. Therefore, we propose to use small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography with a high-energy beam to study the 3D arrangement of the mineralised collagen fibres in the tusk at the macroscopic scale. That will be of high importance for understanding the structure of the tusk and its connection to tusk mechanics.","5045":"We propose to perform multi-scale tomography at either beamline BM18 or BM05 on different molluscan shells.

To achieve coexistence of emulsion droplets and the nematic phase, i.e., to avoid the formation of a classical microemulsion, we need a deeper understanding of the nanostructural features of the system and the effects of added solutes, utilizing time resolved SAXS\/WAXS with temperature control.","5078":"Manmade photonic materials promise to bring tremendous benefits to society as their capability to emit, detect, manipulate and control light is expected to be accompanied by several technological breakthroughs. However, the approaches to creating brilliant colors similar to those found in nature are still in their infancy. In this context, we propose the use of ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) for the evaluation of bio-inspired photonic structures fabricated by exploiting the self-assembly of various building blocks. We aim at a statistical quantification of how different processing conditions affect artificial photonic structures characterized by different symmetries with sizes in the order of visible light wavelengths. We expect the combination of the experiments proposed here with 3D imaging analysis using focused-ion beam (FIB) tomography, microspectroscopy measurements, and optical simulation to shed light on the structural coloration of bio-inspired photonic structures.","5080":"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in many species throughout nature to fight pathogens such as bacteria or even by bacteria themselves to fight other bacteria. These molecules have been around for hundreds of millions of years and have largely been able to avoid bacterial resistance. Yet, they are surprisingly little used in treatments \u2013 mainly because they are rather unstable towards serum proteins and may be toxic to other cells. Here we will focus on nanoparticles obtained by peptide- polymer coacervates and study their formation kinetics under different mixing ratios, pH and ionic strengths . The system under investigation will be poly(acrylic acid)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PAA-PEO) and various antimicrobial peptides with different charges and length. By understanding the kinetic pathways and stability we aim to obtain better control of the processing conditions required for pharmaceutical applications. ","5081":"LNPs are fabricated via rapid-mixing at low pH, where lipids dissolved in alcohol are combined with the acidic aqueous phase containing the mRNA (volume ratio 1:3 ethanol:water), leading to high entrapment efficiencies. Subsequent processing involves dialysis to remove ethanol and neutralize the pH, creating LNPs of neutral surface charge. Understanding the mechanisms behind mRNA-LNP formation is crucial for improving their design. We wish to investigate the fast formation of LNPs by rapid mixing of the molecular alcoholic solution of lipids and the aqueous phase, with a stopped-flow device. We will compare results obtained without RNA, and with RNA of different lengths to cover the entire relevant range.","5082":"We propose to unravel the precise assembly and disassembly mechanism of Cp183 and the coassembly mechanism of RNA with Cp183 capsid protein into mature paricles under different solution conditions. The detailed structural changes will be studied at msec temporal resolution. We will characterize the structure, kinetics, mechanism, and energetics of the assembly and disassembly processes under different conditions. To distinguish between different theoretical kinetic models, we need to vary the initial conditions of the assembly and disassembly reactions. Varying the salt concentration or pH has a critical role on the assembly and disassembly processes, as these factors determine the strength of the interaction between protein capsid molecules and between the RNA and the capsid protein. ","5083":"The EU chocolate market was worth around $45 billion in 2022. However, this business can have a negative environmental impact since 1kg of chocolate has a global warming potential of 2.91-4.15kg CO2 eq., primary energy demand of 30-41 MJ and water footprint of 31-63L. The main contribution for this carbon footprint comes from the raw materials (milk powder, cocoa derivatives and sugar). For this reason, chocolate manufacturers are exploring novel solutions to replace or reduce the amount of these ingredients in chocolate. Cocoa butter and milk fat equivalents (CBE, MFE) are mixtures of triglycerides extracted from different plant-based sources that resemble these two fats in their physical properties. In this project we will use SAXS and WAXS to investigate the crystallization behaviour of commercial CBEs and MFEs, both on their own and mixed with cocoa butter. Our investigation can enable rational design of novel, sustainable chocolate recipes and the related manufacturing processes.","5084":"We will study electrodynamically levitated droplets of a model respiratory aerosol containing the lung surfactant DPPC and salts, using microfocus SAXS\/WAXS in a controlled humidity cell. We will explore the impact of the surfactant self-assembly on salt crystallisation as the droplets lose water and equilibrate with their environment. Our findings will help understand the effect of aerosol microenvironment on virus stability in exhaled droplets, which impacts on transmission of airborne diseases.","5085":"We will study mm-scale droplets of a model respiratory aerosols containing the lung surfactants DPPC and POPC , using microfocus SAXS in a controlled humidity acoustic levitation cell. Temporal and spatial changes in orientation and lattice parameter of the self-assembled surfactant phases throughout the droplet will give insights into water diffusion through and out of the droplet. These are large unknowns in understanding the behaviour of respiratory aerosols after exhalation, key to understanding persistence and spread of airborne pathogens, but the role of the surfactant components and their self-assembly has not been considered. The experimental and modelling methodology is similar to our previous published work on self-assembly of droplets of model lipids and fatty acids from cooking emissions, from a technique development and environmental perspective. ","5086":"In our proposed stopped-flow SAXS experiments we want to elucidate the structure of the initially formed complexes during the mixing of humic acid with oppositely charged cationic polyelectyolyte (cPE). The aim of the sf-SAXS experiment is to probe how the mesoscopic structure of formed complexes evolves over time under different conditions, such as the type of cPEs, their Mw, the mixing ratio and the solvent quality (e.g. the salt concentration). This shall allow for rationalising the tendency for further growth into flocs and precipitates, the compactness of formed complexes, and the tendency to form long-term stably dispersed aggregates \u2013 all aspects of central importance for ultimately understanding the flocculation process that is essential in raw water purification.","5087":"It is unknown how insects form 3D photonic crystals and diversify structural colours via similar compositions (chitin and proteins). We found five phylogenetically close but differently coloured Pachyrhynchus weevils develop 3D diamond photonic crystals in each scale and tune the crystal orientations to produce different colours. We hypothesize such differences in photonic crystal structures between species are accompanied by variations in cuticle compositions, specifically the ratio of chitin\/protein and their crystallinity.  High-resolution XRF-XRD study suggested here will be complemented with micro-FTIR and micro-Raman mapping. This work will reveal the correlation between molecular compositions and photonic crystals structure in differently coloured cuticular scales, the distribution of different components in the skin and photonic crystals in cuticular scales will pave the way for understanding the morphogenesis of diamond photonic crystals of Pachyrhynchus weevils","5088":"The proposed experiment is aimed at studying the structure formation in novel biodegradable polyurethanes for biomedical applications based on multiblock architectures including crystallizable poly(1,4-butylene adipate) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) blocks. These materials demonstrate thermo-induced shape memory effect with two switching points below and above human body temperature. We are going to perform time- and temperature-resolved microfocus SAXS\/WAXS experiments to address formation of two independent crystal phases of covalently bonded blocks inside one spherulite as a function of time and sample thermal history. In addition, will analyze the polymorphic behavior of spherulites using ultrafast heating\/cooling programs. In the proposed experiment, the distribution and thermal behavior of these phases in one single spherulite will be monitored by micro-focus X-ray diffraction combined with nanocalorimetry.","5089":"Lignocellulosic based biocomposites are important for sustainable development. Our group recently developed a green in-situ polymerization of \u025b-caprolactone in lignocellulosic networks, which exhibit high mechanical performance and increased degradable rate in a controlled manner. However, the multiscale structure in our system, including micro\/meso structure of fiber and polymer matrix is not completely understood. We hope through scanning X-ray microdiffraction we can identify the distribution of PCL inside\/outside of the preserved wood cell, and determine the structural variations, such as crystallinity and crystal orientation, etc. We will conduct an ex-situ experiment to control the PCL content, fibrillation extent of wood fibers, and degradable conditions to understand the effects of structural variations. This research will be very important to comprehend the mechanical properties and degradability of the biocomposite samples for improved material design. ","5090":"Previous work using diffraction has shown that the nanocrystal c-lattice parameter in mouse bones can vary due to stresses induced by shrinkage or expansion of collagen in the nanocomposite. Here we propose to use diffraction mapping to examine the effects of dehydration on nanocrystal deformation in different bone tissue types of healing bone, namely callus and cortical bone tissues. The c lattice parameter will be determined in relation to bone healing sites to assess the effects of changes to the levels of mineralization in murine bone samples. By measuring lattice constants before and after exposure to collagen-destroying radiation, residual strain distributions will be determined. Results will help us understand the role and emerence of residual strains in the natural tissue and to asses to what extent, tissue healing modulates these strains.","5091":"This project is aimed at studying the molecular organization in thin films of a series of perovskite solar cells. These molecular architectures propose a probably optimal trade-off between the charge carrier mobility, processing and efficiency due to the molecular architecture. The detailed crystalline structure and phase diagrams will allow to optimize the charge carrier transport in the electronic devices based on such materials. We will also study the stability of perovskite solar cells under differnet conditions. We will use a special environmental chamber to get information about the structure evolution and under different external conditions, including temperature, UV presence and atmosphere for in-situ measurements. This solar cells will be studied using GIWAXS method during applying  different temperatures and UV light. Those, the thermal stability and electrical properties of perspective for organic electronics systems will be studied.","5092":"The aim of this work is to explore the morphological features of novel light modulators termed \u201cphotovoltaic spatial light modulators\u201d (PSLM) for smart window applications. Such modulators co-invented by consortium of our PSLM project funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique, France) are based on polymer semiconductors and liquid crystalline hybrid materials that form an organic multilayer as the photosensitive element. Specifically, due to their exquisite physical properties these materials offer control over the incoming solar radiation","5093":"The aim of this proposal is to study in-situ the structural evolution that water-based suspensions of colloidal polymeric particle suspensions (latex) undergo during film formation by Grazing Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS). The systems under study are soft colloids that closely resemble resins used in real everyday applications and show different drying mechanisms. The latexes entail different chemistry and structural properties (defined by the particle composition, the glass transition temperature of the polymer, and the crystallinity of the phases) and hence exhibit different film formation mechanisms.","5094":"This study aims to investigate the growth of blends of pi-extended selenadiazolopyrazine with diindenoperylene in thin films, featuring various heterostructures (mixed bulk-heterojunction and planar heterojunction). The growth will be monitored in situ via grazing incidence wide angle X-ray diffraction experiments, followed by post-annealing. The insights gained about the molecular arrangement, structure, and mixing behavior of these unique materials will be utilized to elucidate the photophysics of the mixed films, which are of relevance to optoelectronic devices.","5095":"2D polymers (2DPs) have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their interesting electronic properties. One way to realize 2D polymer crystals with large domain size and high crystallinity is by surfactant-monolayer-assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS). After studying the surfactant monolayer assembly and selforientation of the monomers in a previous proposal, we are now planning to investigate the last step in our SMAIS process - the polymerization. The overall goal of the project is to better understand the relation between the surfactant monolayer, the supramolecular pre-organization of the monomers, and the final crystal structure (crystallinity, orientation) of the fully polymerized 2D polymers.","5096":"Lipid membranes are highly interactive and the structure of the proteins is intimately connected with the lipid environment. The motion of lipids and proteins occur on time scales from ns to ms. We introduce a model system in which we use photo-switchable glycoconjugates to induce structural changes in a membrane consisting of DPPC to study the lipid-lipid interaction. The reversibly switching of the glycoconjugates results in a conformation change of the molecule. Existing static XRR and GID measurements on mixed monolayers revealed reversible structural changes in the ordering and orientation of the lipids. The observed structural changes suggest a mechanical coupling between the lipids. The dynamic of this coupling is not well understood yet and needs more investigation. This experiment will not only contribute to the fundamental understanding of membrane dynamics but also to potential applications for molecular switches such as drug delivery, cell recognition and optical storage.","5097":"The transition towards sustainable, plant-based protein sources for food systems requires knowledge on how plant-based proteins interact with food-relevant microstructures. In particular, in the formulation of aerated food systems (e.g. foams), the mechanism by which plant-based proteins stabilise the interfaces is considerably different than that of traditional animal-based protein. This proposal aims to investigate the in situ structures and formation dynamics of plant-based proteins at the air-water interface, using grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The structural information provided by GISAXS forms the missing link between (in house) state of the art interfacial rheology and high resolution but ex situ and static atomic force microscopy (AFM). The experiment will provide a major step forward towards a general understanding of the interfacial stabilisation mechanisms of plant-based proteins.","5098":"The formation of semi-fluorinated alkanes (FnHm diblocks) stable Langmuir films has been known for decades, but their structure at the nanoscale has been only recently elucidated. FnHm diblocks self-assemble at the air-water interface into regular, monodisperse arrays of hexagonally-packed hemimicelles 25 nm to 40 nm in diameter, depending on the chain length, as probed by GISAXS and GIXD. We study mixed binary films of different F8Hm (m between 14 and 20). From thermodynamic measurements, the films might comprise either a segregation of pure hemimicelles, either a mixture of pure or mixed hemimicelles. We intend to perform GISAXS and GIXD experiments to elucidate the structure of the mixed films and determine the intra- and intermicellar structure of the mixed monolayer, towards a better understanding of, and thus ultimately controlling, the mechanism of formation and self-assembly of the hemimicelles.","5099":"The classical Debye-H\u00fcckel theory of electrolytes is no longer valid at very high concentrations (> 1M). Recently, it has been shown that the range of electrostatic interactions is far greater than the Debye length in concentrated electrolytes, called \"underscreening\". The proposal is to map concentration depth profiles of ions in solutions of simple salts in the vicinity (0 - 30 nm) of (a) the air-water interface and (b) the interface decorated with a monolayer of charged or uncharged surfactants. These systems would allow the influence of concentration and surface potential on ion distribution to be investigated. Simultaneous X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXF) at ID10 is highly suited for the determination of concentration depth profiles of different ions can be determined with \u00c5 resolution. Should such experiments be successful it is likely that this method would become the gold standard technique for future investigations of underscreening.","5100":"Because the molecular packing has direct impact in the charge carrier mobility of organic field effect transistors (OFETs), identifying the different polymorphs and determining their stability at the interfaces are key factors for device optimization. In this experiment, we aim at providing a link between the crystallographic changes and electrical conductivity evolution by in-situ monitoring the structure by GIWAXS and the electrical current collected OFETs for C8O-BTBT-OC8, a model system for understanding and controlling polymorphism in devices. This experiment will advance our understanding on the role of interfaces and the kinetic factors affecting the stability of each polymorph.","5101":"This project centres around the creation of machine learning models which will ultimately allow for the prediction of the morphology and ultimately the physical properties of self-assembled aggregates. Due to the mechanisms which lead to molecular self-assembly being poorly understood, the design of new materials for devices is often unachievable. We therefore are developing a model that would predict the morphology of the aggregate from chemical structure alone. In order to generate models capable of predicting the properties of self-assembled aggregates, high-resolution data across a range of compounds needs to be acquired to achieve a prediction with sufficient confidence in order to be useful. This could pave the way for the design of responsive organic materials with the capability of replacing metals in high-value mechanoresponsive devices, amongst other applications.","5102":"We propose to use in-situ anomalous X-ray diffraction to study the working electrode of an electric double layer capacitor. Varying the photon energy at the absorption edge of the electrolyte ions will allow us to obtain ion-specific information and extracting the pair distribution functions, specifically ion-ion, ion-water, and ion-carbon interactions.","5103":"We aim to characterize the structure and dynamics of aqueous gels made of carbon black (CB) nanoparticles stabilized by carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC). These gels are critical to numerous applications, including flow batteries and energy storage. SAXS and XPCS experiments will be performed both at rest and under mechanical solicitation. Here, we focus on the transition from polymer-dominated CB-CMC gels to electrically conductive colloid-dominated CB-CMC gels that we have identified via electric impedance spectroscopy and rheological measurements. In the former case, the gel is based on a continuous polymer network physically crosslinked by isolated CB aggregates, whereas in the latter, a continuous CB network spans the whole material.","5104":"Cellulose is a biodegradable polymer of many uses. It is soluble in some ionic liquids(IL), being environmental solvents. This implies complex interactions between chain and the two IL constituents. We observed that SAXS at large concentration is different from what expected for a usual polymer solution. Moreover, in presence of a few % of water (IL are hygroscopic), an even stronger scattering is measured. This suggests strong concentration fluctuations, getting solvent out of possible clusters. Our first goal here is to study concentration fluctuations, over the full q range. We need a higher flux than lab SAXS due low contrast and low concentrations of chains and water; D2AM is sufficient for medium q range. We need ID02 for its irreplaceable low q range. Our second goal is in-situ study solvent penetration in nanocellulose crystals of a textile fiber, through scanning exploration of a gradient of concentration during swelling. We need a narrow beam only available on synchrotron. ","5105":"Since the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of the mRNA vaccines, RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles have emerged as an efficient delivery system for nucleic acid-based therapeutics. Recently we have developed new formulations of lipoplexes (i.e. complex multilamellar vesicles) which are a promising tool for NA-based therapeutic delivery systems. This proposal aims to study the internal structural organization of the lipoplexes by varying several parameters: : type of nucleic acid used (pDNA, mRNA, siRNA, ASO), process parameters, lipid composition (especially the influence of ionizable lipids), and environmental parameters (temperature and pH). Synchrotron-SAXS will allow us to accurately characterize the multilamellar organization of the lipoplexes, which is challenging with other methods. The results will provide insight into the complex structure of lipoplexes and contribute to the development of improved delivery systems for mRNA and other NA therapeutics.","5106":"Amorphous materials such as polymeric, colloidal or spin glasses are thermodynamically out of equilibrium materials. Such materials undergo aging, a microstructural evolution under quiescent conditions, wherein their free energy decreases with time [1]. Aging can be altered by training the material with a succession of small amplitude creeps and relaxations without breaking the material such that the material reaches deeper minimum in its free energy landscape than it would during quiescent aging.  Overaging has been extensively studied in colloidal glasses and leads to a higher material elasticity and a slowdown of the relaxation time scales. Yet, overaging in colloidal gels is not fully documented (no dynamics measurements). Here, we aim to show that the training of colloidal gels leads to overaging  using rheology coupled to SAXS and XPCS. We will vary the training protocol (to test for efficiency) and compare two gels: carbon black gels and ludox gels to go for universal trends.","5107":"This proposal aims to investigate the oxidation of soot particles produced during combustion processes, with a focus on understanding the impact of different fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Soot particles, which have known links to health issues and climate change, will be studied using a double-stage burner and advanced optical techniques. The addition of Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) at ESRF will allow for detailed analysis at smaller scales. The study aims to isolate and better understand the oxidation process, contributing to improved combustion and emission reduction in the aeronautic industry. The requested beamtime at the ID02 beamline is justified for its unique capabilities in examining particle sizes and morphology. The expected results will inform numerical simulations and aid in developing models for soot oxidation, potentially impacting emissions reduction strategies.","5108":"Our research aims to resolve the phase transitions that occur when alcohol is introduced into aqueous solutions of DMPC and DOPC lipid at high alcohol volume fractions. Alcohol is known as an effective lipid solubilizer, which is exploited in disinfection and drug delivery. A proper understanding of the phase evolution under these conditions is vital to the development of tailored solvation environments for lipids. While there have been numerous studies on alcohol and lipid at lower concentrations, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of the phase behavior of these concentrated solutions. ","5109":"The physical understanding of colloidal transport within liquid-saturated porous media is a prerequisite in many environmental and industrial fields. We wish to use XPCS to study colloidal transport in 3D in a non-transparent mineral-based confining matrix filled with water. This presents several advantages over optical studies of colloidal transport, which rely on optically transparent samples, a 2D geometry and optical matching of the filling fluid. We build upon our knowledge of aqueous clay suspensions and gels to provide a \u201csoil-like\u201d confining matrix, which presents a local planar confinement (platelets separated by the order of 10 to 100 nm) in an overall isotropic sample. In such matrix, we shall study diffusion of 30nm Au nanoparticles. We expect to extract (a) effective diffusion coefficents of Au colloids as a function of platelet separation and size (b) the detailed shape of the time-dependent scattering function for future development of diffusion models in such media.  ","5110":"How gels behave under stress is of uttermost relevance for many applications; it is also scientifically important and challenging, as it involves out-of-equilibrium multiscale materials. In this proposal, we propose to investigate how the structure of colloidal gels evolves during their compaction. To do so, we propose to couple standard imaging and SAXS measurements during the drying in a controlled environment of millimetric beads of fractal colloidal gels. We will characterize how the hierarchical multiscale (from nm to um) structure of gels evolves during drying, as a function of the drying rate and initial colloid volume fraction. We will compare the scattering profiles at rest to the ones during drying to extract the relevant length scales for the compaction and use reverse Monte-Carlo strategy to extract the structure of the colloidal gel during compaction, allowing us to unveil the physical mechanisms at play.","5111":"Nowadays, intensive research is devoted to the development of efficient RNA vectors, able to efficiently complex the genetic material and deliver it to its biological target. In this proposal we would like to investigate the structure and potential efficacy of newly developed lipid-based formulations of non-lamellar structure, containing biocompatible cationic and\/or ionizable lipids, for the delivery of RNA-based therapeutics. We will investigate (i) the structure of the new formulations in different experimental conditions, via static SAXS experiments (ii) the interaction mechanism\/kinetics of the different formulations with synthetic lipid vesicles mimicking endosomal membranes under different pH conditions, via stopped-flow SAXS. This research seeks to advance our understanding on how these lipid particles interact with lipid vesicles and will contribute to the development of evermore effective RNA delivery systems.","5112":"We propose to measure the macroscopic rheology and microstructure of a model system of dense soft microgel particle suspensions using a unique combination of high-shear capillary rheometry and USAXS. Recent measurements revealed distinct differences in shear-thinning viscosity and particle shape depending on the shear rate and particle softness (crosslink density). To our knowledge, USAXS is the only instrument able to measure low q (0.005 nm-1) and capture 2D scattering data necessary to probe anisotropic scattering of relatively large particles (D ~ 260 nm). In addition, the ESRF provides sufficiently high flux needed for small sample volumes (0.25 mm pathlength) and small beam sizes (50 \u00b5m) to probe different flow-planes within the thin capillary. Results from this work will be of significant interest to the rheological and colloidal communities, who aim to understand the effects of particle softness on colloidal suspension rheology.","5113":"We wish to conduct a series of time-resolved SAXS studies during the synthesis of new hydrolytically degradable diblock copolymer nanoparticles. We have recently shown that such nanoparticles can be prepared by \u2018reverse sequence\u2019 polymerisation-induced self-assembly (PISA) in aqueous media with negligible hydrolysis occurring during their synthesis. In essence, a degradable hydrophobic precursor is solubilised using a water-miscible monomer (N,N\u2019-dimethylacrylamide, DMAC) as a co-solvent. As the DMAC polymerise, the hydrophobic block solvency worsens and, at some monomer conversion, nucleation occurs to form latently degradable nanoparticles. Given the highly asymmetric copolymer composition at this point, we predict that (i) the initial nuclei should be vesicles (rather than the spheres observed for conventional PISA syntheses) and (ii) there should be an unprecedented evolution in particle morphology from vesicles to worms to spheres as the DMAC polymerise to full conversion.","5114":"Microtubules (MTs) are one of the major components of the cytoskeleton, involved in cell division, intracellular transport, cell motility, and cell shape. Precise control of the highly-frequent events of tubulin nucleation is needed for a proper cytoskeleton function. Despite years of research, tubulin nucleation is still one of the least understood steps of MT dynamics. To determine the molecular mechanisms directing tubulin nucleation, we will reconstitute in-vitro a minimal model system that mimics the key elements of non-templated cytoskeleton MT assembly. Using state-of-the-art time-resolved SAXS (TR-SAXS) and our home-developed cutting-edge analysis tools, we shall follow, in real-time, the active self-organization, dynamic structures and energetics of tubulin protein subunits and their regulation by nucleotide hydrolysis. These data will resolve the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level by which nucleotides, tubulin, and MT assemble and function.","5115":"A large body of work has been devoted this last decade to membraneless organelles, also called biomolecular condensates, which turn out to ensure a number of essential functions in cells. Notably, they enable biochemical reactions involved for instance in metabolism, homeostasis, stimulus response but also pathological processes such as fibrillation and virus production. Unlike membrane-bound compartments, the formation of these condensates can be viewed as phase separation of fluid mixtures occurring within the active environment of living cells. The chemical reactions hosted by the condensates consume fuel and release waste that are externally adjusted, thus driving the system in a nonequilibrium state. The objective of this project is to investigate the phase separation kinetics of bioinspired condensates under either passive or active conditions, that is, when phase separation is driven by free energy minimization or biochemical reactions, respectively.","5116":"The aim of the proposal is to investigate the self-assembly process and lyotropic liquid crystalline nanostructural formation of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) upon mRNA complexation, on a millisecond time scale using the rapid mixing stopped-flow device combined with the time-resolved SAXS capabilities of the high brilliance ID02 beamline. Driven by the successful clinical use and the exceptional potential of LNPs for mRNA delivery, this proposal will investigate the millisecond kinetics and structural formation of mRNA binding with a range of clinically relevant ionizable LNPs, including the BioNTech\/Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (ALC-0315 and ALC-0159), and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (SM-102 and PEG-DMG).","5117":"The proposed experiment is aimed at studying crystallization mechanisms of semi-crystalline multiblock polyurethanes using ultra-fast chip calorimetry. The studies will be focused on newly synthesized polyurethanes based on poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) as the soft block and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) as the hard block. We are going to perform time-resolved in-situ SAXS\/WAXS experiments to address details of competitive crystallization of soft and hard blocks as a function of chemical composition and thermal history. In addition, using ultrafast heating and cooling we are going to analyze phase composition of the samples containing both PBA and PCL blocks. ","5118":"We will study topological defects in smectic liquid crystals on the scale of a single defect or of a very small number of defects, using nano-diffraction on a thin\r\nfilm (8CB smectic liquid crystal) made of topological defects oriented by a rubbed polymer substrate. We will also study how these structures evolve \r\nwhen nanoparticles are confined and organised within the cores of these defects and how the nanoparticle organization evolves as a function of liquid crystal thickness and nanoparticle concentration. We will scan in 2D, the scanning perpendicular to the oriented defects, both in GISAXS (reflection) and in TSAXS (transmission), allowing for a full reconstruction of the smectic layer distortion, topological defects determination and nanoparticle assembly orientation. Data analysis will take advantage of the methodology previously established in previous average measurements, allowing for a future automatic analysis of the nanoscale scanning.\r\n","5119":"In this experiment we are trying to understand the phenomenon of double melting in semi-rigid chain polymers such as poly(ether ether ketone), (PEEK). As in previous works the focus was laying on the limits of recrystallization of polymer chains during fast heating using \u03bc-beam WAXS, this time we are going to use a dedicated \u03bc-beam SAXS experiment to understand the direct mechanism of the multiple melting behavior that, until now, could only be accessed for crystallization temperatures above the recrystallization limit addressed with conventional heating methods in SAXS and AFM. To achieve this we are going to exploit the exceptionally high flux of the ID13 with its low divergence micro beam setup. We will extend the standard WAXS\/SAXS setup to a pure SAXS configuration to get better resolved SAXS information allowing to extract detailed morphology parameters using the interface distribution function approach.","5120":"Insect wings are remarkably stable lightweight structures that endure the loads of millions of flapping cycles during flight. The insect wings are built of cuticle, a biological composite material of proteins and embedded reinforcing chitin fibers. A wing is structured as a thin cuticular membrane reinforced by tube-shaped longitudinal and cross veins, which subdivide the wing membrane into polygonal so-called cells. Previous experiments using scanning X-ray micro- and nanodiffraction focused on the distribution and orientation of chitin nanofibers in unloaded wing sections. In the membrane, the chitin fibers were oriented longitudinally far from the veins and, surprisingly, perpendicular to the veins in their vicinity. From these results we propose a specific reinforcement of the wing cells to the tensile loads acting on them during flapping flight. In the proposed experiments, this hypothesis will be tested by stretching different sections of a wing in situ under load control.","5121":"This proposal is submitted in continuation of our previous experiment at ESRF (SC5408, ID13, July 2023) in the aim of completing the dataset. The experiment is part of a larger investigation on osteoporotic bone strength, where a deeper understanding of the microstructural changes in bone tissue as a function of age is still missing. In the context of a series of multi-scale structural, mechanical and numerical studies, we aim to acquire high-resolution small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography measurements of the human femoral cortex at a sub-lamellar level. This continuation experiment will complete the dataset allowing us to investigate structure-property relations at the micro-scale, which will contribute to the development of a non-linear homogenized finite element model of the proximal femur, with the aim of improving the assessment of hip strength and fracture predictions in the ageing human hip.","5122":"The aim is to follow the microstructure of novel thermoresponsive hydrogels made of magnetic nanoparticles (akaganeite or nontronite) and Pluronic PF127 copolymer in order to develop cost-effective, and biocompatible hydrogels with multiple stimuli-responsive characteristics. Preliminary rheological experiments reveal a non-monotonic behaviour for storage modulus and gel strength as a function of the temperature. Incorporation of NPs alters the gel network formed by PF127 micelles leading to a transition from a liquid to a strong gel mediated by a soft-gel state, whose microstructure remains unexplored. We propose to investigate the relationships between the structural organization changes and rheological properties, during in situ thermal treatment of hybrid hydrogels with and without the presence of a magnetic field. We expect to improve the understanding on the enhancement of strength and flexibility of PF127 gels with the presence of nanoparticles.","5123":"Full-physical synthesis of metal nanoclusters below 3 nm in size holds the promise to deliver ligand-free clusters that are active for catalytic or (bio)photonic applications. Stabilization of the smallest clusters in laser-induced fragmentation remains a challenge, if ultrapure colloid from laser ablation without any surfactants is used. We introduced graphene oxide (GO) as non-passivating agent (report to SC5265). In the first experiment an influence on the fragmentation at high laser fluence was found. This change is explained as caging effect rather than inhibition of cluster ripening. Therefore, it is proposed to block agglomeration via direct adsorption of the initial colloid on GO by electrostatic screening prior to fragmentation.","5124":"In addition to the usual glass transition, vitrimers (polymer networks with associative crosslinks) show a transition from viscoelastic liquid to viscoelastic solid (topological transition). This is due to the freezing of the reversible network topology, caused by the slowing down of the bond exchange reactions upon cooling. The vitrimers investigated by us present clusters of linkers embedded in the polymer matrix. The T-dependence of the inter-cluster average distance reveals an increase in the expansion coefficient at the temperature where the viscosity reaches 1012Pa.s (defined as the topological transition Tv). We aim to follow the structural relaxation of the system at the inter-cluster level, to determine the T-dependence of its characteristic time and compare it with the activation energy of the bond exchange reaction. This study shall provide the definite microscopic observation of the topological transition by scattering techniques.

The sample preparation chamber developed in our group allows deposition of multi-component organic thin films with lateral gradient distribution of the components. Spatially-resolved X-ray scattering measurements along the gradient axis of such samples will provide compositionally-resolved information about the crystalline structure, degree of intermixing and morphology of the blends. Exploiting machine learning (ML) tools for X-ray scattering data analysis, we will extract the relevant structural information from the measured data in close to real time. These results will be correlated with the optical properties of the same samples measured prior to the X-ray experiment.

In particular, we will investigate how the dispersion composition (NP\/BSA ratio and ionic strength) will affect the monolayer structure and density by means of grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR). Then, the monolayers will undergo a compression\/expansion cycle in a Langmuir trough and, during both compression and expansion, GISAXS and XRR will be performed. This will allow determining the inter-particle distance variation and eventual desorption\/re-adsorption phenomena. This study will provide new fundamental insight on the effect of NP\/BSA interactions on the conformation of adsorbed BSA. Moreover, it will allow assessing the use of mixed NP\/BSA dispersions as novel green adaptive surfactants for the stabilization of complex fluid interfaces.","5127":"Lipid-porphyrin conjugates (Lip-Por) are unique compounds that can self-assemble into liposome-like structures named \u201cPorphysomes\u201d.

The aim of the proposed project is to assess the structural changes upon illumination of the monolayers made either of pure conjugates or their mixture with cholesterol, by analyzing the vertical fine structures of the monolayers but also the density profiles of the sulfur groups present in their structures and ions present in the buffer before and after illumination by the unique combination of X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXF) at the air\/buffer interface respectively.","5128":"We propose to study the dynamics of synaptic vesicles  and of artificial lipid vesicles in dense vesicle pools by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), extending our previous work on artificial lipid vesicles. Pools are aggregates of vesicles which are clustered together by proteins causing an attractive interaction. We are interested in the short range (hindered) diffusion of vesicles which are at least partially arrested in the pool.  The dynamics  takes place on much slower timescales than free diffusion, and can also be distinguished from free diffusion via the q-dependence.","5129":"We propose a combined grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and X-ray reflectivity study on the effect of aerolized and gaseous perfluorocarbons (a- and gFCs) to protein adsorption at Langmuir films using different proteins, surface pressures and gas pressures at beamline ID10 of the ESRF. Aim of the proposed experiment is the determination of the lateral and vertical structure of model membranes of lung surfactant lipids like anionic DPPA and zwitterionic DPPC before and after protein adsorption and the influence of an overlying FC atmosphere to the protein adsorption behaviour. The substances have been selected based on their biomedical research interest. Especially a- and gFCs with a high vapour pressure are in focus of research as they represent a new approach to replace liquid FC ventilation and the unsafe use of the animal LS replacements to treat LS injuries or deficiency in adults and neonatal children.

In Li-ion the liquid electrolytes are flammable by nature and moving to a safe solid-state one is of interest. In addition, solid electrolytes are foreseen as a solution to avoid the main drawback of such batteries, i.e. polysulfide shuttle. During cycling, the soluble products, Li polysulfide (Li2Sx, 2<x<8), produced at the cathode diffuse in the electrolyte until the anode, in a back-and-forth manner leading to strong capacity fading. This dynamic process is highly dependent on the electrolyte nature and new chemistry is needed to develop a reliable device. We propose XANES and XES investigation on solid-state organic\/inorganic electrolyte. To mimic battery failure, the electrolytes are pre-contaminated with Li2Sx of different chain lengths and concentration. The goal is to determine the interlink between the electrolyte nature and the polysulfides to move toward an optimized material.","5132":"     This LTP aims at developing a new capability at ESRF combining in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction with flash differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC). FDSC is an emerging technology that allows for the precise control of sample temperature and the measurement of calorimetric properties at heating\/cooling rates of 10^4 K\/s or above, several orders of magnitude higher than conventional calorimetry. Combining FDSC with high-energy X-ray diffraction will allow us to obtain detailed structural information on the atomic scale of systems in previously unprobed thermodynamic states. This new technique can be applied to a wide range of systems including but not limited to supercooled liquids, glasses (oxides, metallic glasses, chalcogenides, etc.), polymers, and phase change materials.

The far higher reactivity of EGDMA than that of NIPAM results in the formation of microgels with unique, star-like architecture. Our hypothesis is that the improved properties (sharper volume phase transition, higher swelling degree) arise from such structure. We aim to verify this hypothesis and to gain strict control over the synthesis of star-like microgels. To this end, we will measure form factors of particles produced with varying synthesis parameters and combine their analysis with numerical simulations, to reach in-depth understanding of the relationship between synthesis protocol and structure and key features of the microgels.

These photonic materials offer technological breakthroughs, yet controlled fabrication remains a challenge. Self-assembly of nanosized building blocks shows promise for creating periodic arrangements, but quantifying large volumes and their order\/disorder is problematic. We propose using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Ultra-Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (USAXS) to characterize self-assembled photonic assemblies made with colloidal patchy particles. Although 3D FIB tomography is limited to small volumes, combining it with X-ray scattering can illuminate structural coloration mechanisms in artificial photonic structures.","5140":"The early-age structure of amorphous alkali aluminosilicate gels, the binding phase in low-CO2 alternative cements, will be characterized for the first time using a stopped-flow apparatus paired with SAXS and USAXS to support a kinetic model describing the mechanism of gel formation. The analysis of a wide range of gel chemistries will provide critical insight into changes in structure and kinetics due to gel chemical composition. The USAXS beamline at ESRF is uniquely poised to investigate this system due to the required q-range of 0.001 nm-1 to 1 nm-1 along with a time resolution of several milliseconds. Understanding the time-resolved structure is critical for chemical formulation strategies to control rheological properties of low-CO2 geopolymer cement binders.

We developed a novel multicompartment delivery systems, in which cytotoxic drug is encapsulated into fibroin nanoparticles with outer lipid shell. To improve tagreting and transport properties of the nanovectors, the lipid shell was modified by extracelluar vesicles. However, the internal structure of such hybrid nanovectors remains unknow as well as fusion mechanism with lipid membranes and effect of protein corona on their interaction, that is crucial to optimize shell composition  for efficient drug delivery and release.

The mechanisms directing these processes are poorly understood, owing to the size of tubulin and its highly dynamic character. Tau proteins that stabilize MT, are major determinants of cytoskeleton stability. Malfunctions of tubulin and tau are involved in various pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We propose to reconstitute in vitro minimal model systems that mimic these key elements of the cytoskeleton, and follow, in real-time, their coassembled dynamic structures, stability, and interactions.

Most bioactive molecules are poorly soluble in water and need hydrophilic carriers to be assimilated1. Nanovectors ensure optimal performance with minimal quantities due to high surface\/volume ratio. In the most promising formulations the carriers are also derived from natural sources. In these systems the structure-function is complicate, stemming from the subtle balance of many contributions. Here we propose to study the structure of new nanoformulations prepared from agricultural wastes (OP) or algae (EPS). Both components were mixed with the helper lipid egg-yolk phosphocholine to impart amphiphilic character for self-assembly and structural versatility at the nanoscale. The nanocarriers were used to deliver hydroxytyrosol, neem and 3-omega oils to plants and insects.

To improve such processes, it is crucial to understand the timescales of ion-induced assembly and how these are affected by process conditions. Additionally, it is essential to improve our understanding of ion transport through the assembled CNF hydrogel and to critically assess the hypothesis that the ion-induced assembly \u201clocks\u201d the oriented structure of CNFs. In this experiment, we use a shear-free flow-focusing mixing experiment combined with in-situ scanning SAXS to gain insights into the ion interactions with CNF dispersions and hydrogels.

For e.g., tuning the nanostructure of LCNPs results in a significant difference in the release profile of encapsulated bioactives. However, it is uncertain whether these LCNPs retain their original structure upon contact with physiological relevant media at body temperature, and the link between their internal nanostructure and cell cytotoxicity. Here we will use SAXS to unravel the real-time phase behaviour of LCNPs with different cell media, and further investigate the relationship between nanostructure, cell cytotoxicity and uptake. The results will shed light on future strategies to transform LCNPs into a viable therapeutic entity ideal for biomedical applications.","5150":"Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth and an essential sustainable resource to humanity. Native cellulose exists in a crystalline nanofiber, cellulose microfibril (CMF). CMFs in higher plants are believed to have identical nanoscale morphology with a fibril width of 3 nm due to the shared biosynthetic mechanisms. However, cellulose-rich plant tissues have thicker CMFs, including cotton fiber with 5-nm-wide CMFs. This size variation is puzzling and beyond the current understanding of plant cellulose biosynthesis. Here, to better understand the structural evolution of cotton CMFs during the late development stage, we will use microfocus X-ray scattering to probe the ultrastructural change of never-dried cotton fiber in various drying conditions. The results will help us understand the formation mechanism of thick CMFs in cotton.

It plays a role as an exoskeleton and is also used in dioptrical systems as a lens. Multiple cuticle modifications to adjust the properties to its specific function have been reported, such as metal ion incorporation, hydration, chitin fiber orientation and halogen doping. These modifications not only affect the macroscopic material properties but may also act on the chitin crystallite lattice. Previous results show minute lattice strains of chitin c-axis across horseshoe crab cornea, when measured in dry conditions, which may increase the chitin birefringence affecting the overall optical properties of the lens. Using high resolution scanning WAXS to obtain complementary data under hydrated conditions will help understanding the fundamental relationships in natural chitin-based materials and pave the way for tuning anisotropic properties for synthetic fibrous materials.","5152":"Biomimetic minerals are not on par with their natural counterpart, mostly due to lack of understanding regarding the biological control that is exerted during the mineral morphogenesis. Not only the physico-chemical attachment of monomers\/precursors and their assembly is important, but also the biological control over the system. In addition to specific biomolecules, mechanosensing and subsequent mechanotransduction via the cytoskeleton is thought to shape the forming biomineral. We propose using sea urchin skeletogenic cell cultures to identify the influence of the cytoskeleton on biomineralization in situ, measuring different preparations of skeletogenic cells by means of XRD\/XRF mapping to obtain spatially resolved information of processes taking part in shaping the nascent mineral phase and its crystallization. These experiments will allow to answer questions at the interface of the physico-chemical understanding of biomineralization and the biological control over this process.","5153":"Silk threads spun by bagworms (Psychidae) show superb mechanical properties, resulting from a highly ordered fibrillar organization. The SAXS\/WAXD analyses using nanoscale X-ray beam for a single bagworm silk (performed at ESRF, ID-13 beamline during SC5011and 5259) resolved an anisotropic structural feature made of a radial gradient in diameters of mesoscale nanofibrillar assembly. However, influence of such radial heterogeneity of mesoscale nanofibrillar assembly on the mechanical properties of bagworm silk has not been known. In order to clarify the influence of radial structural heterogeneity on the mechanical properties, we will conduct a dynamic SAXS\/WAXD measurements using nanoscale X-ray beam during the single fiber stretching in this proposal, and we aim clarifying how the radial heterogeneity of mesoscale structural order affect on the superb mechanical properties of bagworm silk.","5154":"Mycelium composite has attracted significant attention in the last two decades for its functionality and sustainability. While the mycelium formation is essential to the production of the composites, the fungal growth results in the decay of the cell wall structure, which is thought to be detrimental to the composite properties. Here, we utilize the wood decay to activate the biomass as a starting material for wood-based carbon materials. We expect that the wood decay will result in more porous cell wall structures, while the mycelium growth will contribute to the increase of nitrogen in the biomass due to the deposition of chitin as the main component of fungal cell walls. To examine the effects of fungal effects on the ultrastructure of wood, we will conduct a simultaneous S\/WAXS experiment of mycelium composite. The results will provide insight into the structural changes and will contribute to designing of activation process of wood by fungal growth","5155":"We will study the structure of nanorod assemblies confined within smectic grain boundary topological defects. We have shown that these nanorod assemblies  present well-defined order and orientation everywhere on a given sample leading to anisotropic optical properties. However, in order to take full profit of these properties but also in a more fundamental perspective, to understand in depth the anisotropy that can be reached for the optical properties of nanorods arrays, it is important to fully control the structure of these nanorod arrays. We will thus determine the order and orientation of various nanorod assemblies as a function of nanorod size and of nature of the ligands grafted around the nanorods that may be coupled to the smectic layers below the nanorod assemblies. We will study the impact of the liquid crystal structural variations as a function of thickness.

Many efforts are underway to develop photonic or optoelectronic BPLC devices but are hindered by narrow BP temperature ranges, widened by adding polymers or nanoparticle, NPs. Inorganic NPs are also added to increase functionality and lower high driving voltages needed for display applications. We previously showed that 4 nm gold NPs in BPLCs reversibly form giant 3D cubic crystals but apart from our study, the NP spatial distributions, important for applications and understanding BPLC properties, have not been characterized. Small angle Xray scattering, SAXS, will be applied to study the effect of the NP size and shape on the NP spatial distribution and BPLC thermal stability.

To this purpose, we would like to enlarge the time and length scales probed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using\r\nX-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). A peculiarity of microgel particles is their softness, namely the ability to deform and compress, adjusting both\r\nshape and volume, in contrast to hard spheres. By controlling the peculiar particle softness of a microgel, we would like to explore the dynamics of overpacked\r\nstates that encompass glassy and jamming dynamics to highly compressed states with an effective volume fraction much larger than one.

We propose to create a metallic layer anchored below a diacetylene monolayer to produce a metal-organic device with various electronic response. We will use the strategy we developed based on the Langmuir monolayer procedure. The monolayer will be formed by the diacetylene molecule deposited on a subphase containing silver ions. The silver layer is obtained via the reduction of the ions by radiolysis of the water limited below the surface and induced by the evanescent x-rays beam which is simultaneously used to probe the surface transformations.

A thin GO layer can be effectively utilized in applications such as transparent conductors, sensors, et al. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) is a widely used technique for thin film deposition. However, conventional LB deposition often results in the folding and overlapping of GO nanosheets before achieving continuous layers. This effect is influenced by edge-to-edge negatively charged interactions of GO nanoflakes, governed by the presence of ionized carboxylic acid groups. Carboxylic groups can be employed to modify GO nanoflakes with amino molecules, altering charge and van der Waals interactions. The proposal aims to use XRR and GIWAXS techniques to study GO assembly at the air-liquid interface. The results will help determine the composition of modified or reduced GO nanoflakes and experimental conditions for defect-free layer formation.","5160":"The description of the ion transfer over an active interface remains largely unexplored at the molecular level. According to a 2011 study by H. B. de Aguiarin on surfactant at LL interface, many well established theories on molecule conformation or orientation may need to be reexamined in light of new research. These studies on ion transfer at liquid\/liquid interface are essential for progressing in fundamental understanding of factors governing the separation process. Our proposal involves pursuing an innovative methodology that was established several years ago at ILL and ESRF. This involves combining complementary experiments (using neutrons and X-rays) with modelling to concentrate on this particular mechanism. \r\nX-ray reflectivity (on ID10) will be used to probe the liquid \/liquid interface in order to identify the uranyl cation distribution (U022+) at equilibrium that will driven by extractant molecules (monoamide in oily phase) from the aqueous phase up to the organic phase. \r\n","5161":"Access to the rotational dynamics is essential for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and their use in magnetically-induced hyperthermia, where heat is generated due to the rotation of the MNPs in a medium by exploring them to an alternating magnetic field. By embedding MNPs in a thermo-responsive hydrogel, the structure shrinks with increasing temperature and will change the translational and rotational diffusion of the NPs. Therefore, we propose an experiment to measure these smart magnetic systems' dynamics in dependence on temperature and magnetic field strength using XPCS and XCCA. We want to investigate the translational as well as the rotational dynamics of anisotropic active cobalt ferrite nanoparticles embedded in the smart polymer matrix. We want to clarify the rotational movement of the NPs within the gels by triggering the system with different magnetic field strengths and temperatures.

Our sample preparation chamber allows the deposition of multicomponent organic thin films with lateral gradient distribution of the components. Spatially-resolved X-ray scattering measurements along the gradient axis of the films will provide compositionally-resolved information about the crystalline structure, degree of intermixing, and morphology of the blends. These results will be correlated with the optical properties of the same samples measured prior to the X-ray experiment.

Their properties are determined by the attractive interactions and volume fraction of their subunits. CGs' microstructure and mechanical properties can be adjusted through moderate shear. Here, the studied CGs consist of colloid-polymer mixtures (PAM & fumed silica particles in water\/glycerol mixtures) that either (i) spontaneously aggregate into gels or (ii) undergo shear-induced gelation via irreversible colloid flocculation due to polymer bridging. This research explores shear-assisted aggregation by Rheo-SAXS -XPCS to determine the range of mechanical properties and microstructures that can be generated. It also compares these properties with those created by varying the volume fraction for a fixed shear history. Additionally, it seeks to identify shear sequences that can \"freeze\" structural anisotropy in CGs upon cessation of flow.","5164":"Enzymatic milk gels result from the destabilization of casein micelles, which are natural colloids found in milk. After aggregation,\nthese soft particles have been shown to display \u201ccontact-aging\u201d, i.e. the reinforcement of their contact or \u201csintering\u201d over time. This\nmicroscopic mechanism may drive the pronounced structural aging reported for a wide variety of colloidal gels, where the gel network is\nfound to coarsen over time. The casein micelles are colloids with softness that can be adjusted by varying the pH or adding different types of\nsalt. Within this proposal, we aim to relate the microscopic rearrangement of casein micelles with tuneable softness and the evolution of the\nmesoscopic structure of the gels.","5165":"We request beam time on ID2 with the stopped-flow device to monitor the formation of toroid poly(benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) nanoparticles. Upon solvent-shifting (good to poor solvent) this hydrophobic homopeptide forms nanoparticles (100-800 nm) with a variety of morphologies, including toroids and other multi-handle topologies. Until now, no satisfactory mechanism has been proposed to account for the emergence of these intriguing shapes. Our preliminary experiments unambiguously show that the toroids exist in solution (cryo-TEM, SAXS) and that they form within less than 10s (stopped-flow). However, more information is needed about the structural changes at this time scale. Today, time resolved USAXS-SAXS coupled with stopped-flow is the only experiment able to monitor the topological changes from an isotropic droplet to a toroidal particle.

One common strategy to increase this stability involves modifying the NP-grafted ligands. Contrary to common wisdom, our experiments indicated that the dependence on chain length can be nonmonotonic: short and long chains destabilized CdSe NPs but intermediate-sized ones were stabilizing. In this proposal, we aim to determine the interactions acting between NPs in solution, and to resolve how these vary with ligand type. We propose to use exacting SAXS measurements to extract the second virial coefficient, which combined with all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations will allow to evaluate the interaction potential between the NPs.

We are going to explore with X-ray scattering the structural features of these systems at different conditions of swelling where interplay between the hydrophilicity of PMOx and the hydrophobicity of HEMA provides highly swollen hydrogels with the unique ability to sustain larger deformations due to the hidden length stored in aggregated hydrophobic HEMA backbones. ","5168":"We have recently developed a new class of thermoresponsive amphiphilic diblock copolymers that can switch reversibly between four copolymer morphologies in aqueous solution. This enables the viscoelastic properties of the material to be controlled within a narrow temperature range that is relevant for potential biomedical applications. We now wish to conduct a series of time-resolved SAXS studies during the synthesis of such thermoresponsive diblock copolymer nanoparticles via RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerisation. We also wish to use SAXS\/USAXS to characterise the evolution in copolymer morphology from spheres to worms to vesicles to lamellae between 5\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C. A machine-learning algorithm will be implemented to analyse these SAXS patterns and hence quantify the composition of intermediate mixed phases (e.g. spheres + worms, or worms + vesicles, or vesicles + lamellae).","5169":"Modern food emulsions prepared entirely with plant-grown products are attracting increased market share as they offer routes to sustainable food supplies as well as healthy products.  Applications include drinks and other products with various amounts of oil and stabiliser.  Pea proteins are attractive for these applications as they provide for low allergenicity.  Recent studies with scattering methods, confocal microscopy and rheological measurements have identified several interesting properties with large amounts of protein in the continuous water phase that cause complex flow behaviour with a yield stress and time dependent moduli.  This proposal will investigate this behaviour with rheoSAXS measurements that should provide understanding and lead to improvements for materials where rheology is crucial both in processing and for \u2018mouth feel\u2019 when consumed.","5170":"Living cells are organized into distinct sub-compartments to facilitate spatiotemporal regulation of biological reactions. Groundbreaking studies suggested that membraneless compartments of proteins and nucleic acids play such a crucial role and are formed through a liquid-liquid phase separation. Many in vitro models mimicking these compartments \u2013 hereafter called condensates \u2013 have emerged to understand their liquid-like properties. Here, we will investigate the growth and dissociation kinetics of condensates composed of phosphorylatable peptides and RNA, driven by enzymatic reactions. We will use time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-USAXS) to probe the size evolution in the submicrometer scale. The collected data will constrain models allowing us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, in particular whether the growth and dissociation are limited by enzymatic reactions or by diffusion.","5171":"Wood is a fundamental material for our everyday life. The useful properties of wood, such as its lightweight, strength, and durability, come from its unique tissue structure. The xylem tissue consists of fibers, vessels, and ray cells, each serving distinct roles. The organization of wall components (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin) is believed to govern the functionality of each cell type. Still, limited research has been done to characterize the structural differences among these components at high spatial resolution. In this experiment, we will examine 36 wood species using scanning X-ray microscopy to analyze the ultrastructure of xylem tissue cells. We expect to uncover how cellulose and other wall components are organized across different xylem cells and how these structural differences correlate with their functionalities. The outcomes will deepen our understanding of xylem morphogenesis and functionalities and offer insights for designing new cellulose-based materials.","5172":"The aim of the proposed experiment is to investigate the structure\/properties relationship of novel grafted-to block copolymers of low molecular weight towards promising applications in nanolithography. The self-assembly of such grafted polymers has not been studied in detail. Especially, the capability of selective blocks to form rare morphologies that offers for these materials unique advantages for nanotechnology applications. Diblock copolymers with oligomeric side chains provide high controllability over their dimensions, enabling the creation of various architectures. The complex chemical architecture provides polymorphic behavior which can be addressed during in situ SAXS\/WAXS experiments with multi-stage temperature program. The selective melting and crystallization processes of various blocs will be studied under different thermal conditions. ","5173":"The objective of this proposal experiment lies in using in situ annealing experiments on a temporal scale to clarify the correlation between the morphology evolution of complex multicomponent organic solar cells (OSCs) and their device performance, which aims to precise control the phase separation length scales through the manipulation of crystallization, and seek to identify the optimal balance between crystallization and phase separation to achieve efficient and stable organic solar cells. Our motivation is to integrate kinetic and thermodynamic analyses to uncover the transformation from single-molecular packing to multiple-phase-scale changes for the morphological evolution during thermal annealing treatment of thin films deposited by ultrasonic spray-coating and to reveal the complex structure-performance relationships that connect morphological evolution with device efficiency.","5174":"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a spontaneous segregation of molecules into distinct liquid phases, creating functional environments that regulate biochemical reactions. LLPS involves protein-protein and protein-water interactions, with water playing a crucial but often underexplored role. Kosmotropic and chaotropic agents, such as Hofmeister series salts, can alter water structuring and protein dynamics, impacting LLPS. However, their specific effects on LLPS dynamics are unclear due to difficulties in probing water's role. X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) offers a unique opportunity to investigate fast and complex dynamics. This proposal aims to utilize XPCS to study LLPS dynamics in protein solutions modulated by kosmotropic and chaotropic agents, to elucidate how changes in water structuring influence the phase behaviour and internal dynamics of the separated phases. This will provide crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive LLPS.","5175":"Stress-relaxation mechanisms are regularly observed in amorphous systems, ranging from soft colloidal gels to hard metallic glasses. They are often characterized by hyper-diffusive particle displacements and compete with the spontaneous structural relaxations. Despite intense research is ongoing both experimentally and theoretically, their nature and properties at the microscopic length-scale remain elusive. For this reason, we want here to use Small Angle X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy to study the dynamical signatures (length-scale dependence, degree of cooperativity) of the stress relaxation mechanisms in a colloidal glass as a function of the amount of residual internal stresses. This experiment will give a contribution to the understanding of the stress-related dynamical behaviours, frequently recognised in glassy systems but not yet fully clarified.","5176":"We will use GIWAXS and GISAXS to understand the structural changes in mixed halide perovskites APbX3 (A=methylammonium, formamidinium, cesium; X=Cl, Br, I). We will track the light-induced segregation of halides in I\/Br and Br\/Cl mixed perovskites. We will observe the formation of pure phase domains (i.e. I-rich, Br-rich or Cl-rich) and characterize their typical size and time scale over which they appear. We will study the influence of chemical composition and crystal grain size on halide migration. This information will help to improve the stability of the perovskite-based solar cells and give an insight into ion migration in perovskite structures.\nThe samples will be prepared at ESRF using own portable spin coater which was already tested at ID10.","5177":"Considering the shift towards a recycling-based economy, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol (CO2+3H2\u21ccCH3OH+H2O) has the potential to emerge as a sustainable route for generating both an energy source and a platform chemical. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere have been increasing fast and steadily since the industrial revolution, causing global warming and climate change with far-reaching consequences for the planet. Thus, developing technologies that limit carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is vital before environmental damage is irreversible. To this end, CO2 capture and conversion into added-value chemicals is an important and viable strategy to reduce CO2 emissions while creating economic value.","5178":"Steel slag is one of the most common wastes produced by the steelmaking process1. Since the world\r\nsteel-request has increased during the last decades, the need to upcycle these slags has become\r\nmore demanding and urgent. In this framework, Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking slags (EAF-slags)\r\nrepresent a real challenge for the upcycling processes, because of their heterogeneous composition\r\ndue to the presence of different metal oxides (e.g., FeO, Ca2SiO4, Mg2SiO4, Ca12Al14O33) at different\r\nsize ranges. Going through the state-of-the-art, these slags present various revalorization\r\npotentialities, such as filters for P-removal from wastewater2, additives for Portland cement3, and\r\nfillers for polymers4. ","5179":"The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the impact on the long- and short-range of defects accumulation induced by alteration in the stoichiometry of Li-rich\r\nlayered oxide as well as lithium extraction\/insertion in the electrochemical charge\/discharge in lithium batteries (LIBs) by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution\r\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS).","5180":"Recycling spent Li-ion batteries has attracted significant attention (high demand, pollution). On the other hand, Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) have been studied ascathodes for batteries. PBAs structure, AxM[M \u00b7 zH2O, consists of a double perovskite framework with (C#N) anions bridging MN6 and M C6 octahedra; A+ and H2O occupy the interstitial sites. PBAs capacity to intercalate Ni and Co was suggested by Cui et al.; such a possibility opens the utilization of PBAs for Li-ion battery recycling, using an equivalent technology than employed for lithium recovery. We have studied the recovery of Co and Ni by an electrochemical method using K0.68Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.89 1.86 H2O. However, the electrochemical and structural studies showed contradictory results suggesting that Co2+\/Ni2+ intercalation could be hindered by competition with H3O+.","5181":"This proposals combines our expertise in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with multi-facility characterization to reveal the fundamental relationships between\r\nsynthetic parameters and formation steps of MOFs relevant for capturing, storage and further conversion of industrial exhausts into valuable chemicals. The\r\nsorption capacity and kinetics of MOFs are strongly dependent not only on the type of framework but also on the number and type of defects, crystallite size and\r\nshape. The inter-relation\r\nbetween the macroscopic properties and mechanism of nucleation and growth represents one of the main grey areas, which hinders further progress in the tailored\r\nsynthesis of MOFs for targeted applications. Our aim is to unravel the crystallization mechanism of Zr-based MOFs establishing the link between the temporal\r\nevolution and structure of intermediate compounds and secondary building units (SBUs) with the macroscopic properties of the final MOF.","5182":"Aerospace components are susceptible to wear and damage over time due to the harsh operating\r\nenvironments, which involve both high rotational speeds and high temperatures. Many of these\r\ncomponents reach their \u201cend of life\u201d stage prematurely due to our inability to repair them. This\r\nproblem is especially wasteful and uneconomic because such components, particularly turbine\r\nblisks, use high-strength and high-cost Ni-based superalloys. Such material requires special tooling\r\nand consumes a significant amount of energy during the original manufacturing process. Repairing\r\ndamaged aerofoils can save ~ 45% in terms of carbon footprint and ~ 36% of the total energy when\r\ncompared to replacement with a new aerofoil [1]. The energy and cost savings are much higher for\r\nturbine blisks, where the whole blisk needs to be replaced even if a single aerofoil is damaged.","3349":"Pathogenic mechanisms of absestos-related diseases are still not well understood. In chrysotile, the most commercialized asbestos, Fe and other toxic metals are worth considering in its pathogenicity. Their release is strictly connected to that of Mg when fibres are dissolved in the lung environment. In vitro THP1-cells studies with chrysotile fibres, reporting the contribution of Fe in cells mortality, demonstrated the formation of aggregated structures of both fibrous and non-fibrous species. In these clusters, we identified micrometric iron compounds by Raman spectroscopy as Fe oxides and sulphides. Dissolution products herein needs further investigation, especially in the spatial distribution of elemental Fe and toxic metals. Synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence mapping and micro-XANES analyses are expected to clarify the metals mobilization mechanism, highlighting both their intracellular spatial distribution and the changes in their valence state.
