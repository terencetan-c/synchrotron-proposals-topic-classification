developed a crystallization strategy that promotes in-plane growth of ZIF-L on nanoporous single-layer graphene, forming a few unit-cell-thick film. This 2D morphology of the MOF film allows us to achieve extremely attractive gas separation performance marked by H2 permeance over 1000 GPU accompanied with H2\/N2 selectivities of over 40. While electron diffraction in TEM along the [001] zone axis seem to confirm the structure of ZIF-L, we could not obtain in-depth understanding of lattice parameter and crystallinity of the ZIF-L film, partly arising from the fact that ZIF-L is not stable under the electron beam. In particular, our interest is to understand the similarilty and differences of the novel 2d film with reference to the known 3D structure. Finally, the synthesis strategy, based on promotion of in-plane grain growth and etching of out-of-plane growth, is extremely attractive to replicate to wider range of two-dimensional MOFs and MOFs interesting for carbon capture.\r\n","13":"We have synthetized and fully characterized the spin \u00bd 1D- Heisenberg magnet \u03b2-VOSO4. However, we find disagreements between the measured lab x-ray and neutron ToF patterns (taken at 10K) and the published room temperature atomic structure. These disagreements are either due to a distortion of the lattice or to the presence of impurities. Either way, we need to clarify this to fully understand the structure and magnetism in our samples. Here we propose to initially take the diffraction pattern of our powder sample as a function of temperature (10K-300K) and if necessary, complement this with single crystal diffraction patterns. ","26":"Barocaloric (BC) materials are solid state compounds that present large thermal changes related to solid-solid phase transitions induced by pressure. It is very important to understand the structural transitions that take place as a function of pressure from 1 bar to 1000 bar in these materials. Recently, a custom-made sample-cell developed at ESRF-SNBL showed that we are able to induce phase transitions in situ with pressure and access a new window into the dynamic structural changes occurring during BC transitions. In this proposal we will examine the dynamic structural changes occurring in situ under pressure and temperature of 6 different materials: [(CH3CH2CH2CH2)4N][M(N(CN)2)3] (M = Mn2+ or Cd2+) [1, 2], (C10H21NH3)2MnCl4 [3], (C9H19NH3)2MnCl4 [3],  (NH4)2SO4 [4], and CH(NH2)2I [5], with some of the largest BC tunability and reversible entropy changes known. The measurements will determine key mechanisms dictating BC properties and help to tailor BC properties further.\r\n\r\n\r\n","38":"Conversion\/alloying materials (CAMs) as anodes for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) offer higher capacities than conventional intercalation materials but struggle with stability over many cycles. Their complex cycling mechanism, undergoing through a series of transformations combining crystalline and amorphous phases, make CAMs challenging to understand on the basis of chemical structures even with the most informative operando techniques. We have recently observed that Sb-based CAMs have surprisingly high capacity at high charge rates, and preliminary operando XRD results suggest that this may be because of different cycling mechanisms compared to slower charge rates, suggesting that kinetics plays a crucial role in the formation of certain phases during cycling. Thus, this experiment will focus on elucidating the main structural differences in the reaction mechanism of a selection of Sb-based CAMs and their Bi- and Sn-analogues as a function of the applied cycling rates with operando XRD.  ","41":"In this experiment, we aim to study mechanism of formation of heteroatom doped graphene inside the confined space of layered silicate.\r\nWe use synthetic fluorohectorite clay, which are 1 nm thin negatively charged sheets kept together by interlayer cation, and we exchange cations by dyes. We\r\n demonstrated that we can synthetize graphene in clay interlayer by pyrolyzis using different dyes, such as safranine, cyan violet etc. at very low temperatures\r\n compared to standard process used in industry.\r\nThis heterostructure \u2013 layered silicate with heteroatom doped graphene in the interlayer is promising candidate not just for fabrication of doped graphene itself, but\r\n also for battery applications as active components of anodes. We want to 1) study kinetics of pyrolysis to understand formation mechanism of graphene and 2)\r\n select other potential dye candidates that will lead to formation of as large graphene flakes in the interlayer as possible.","59":"The synthesis of Azo-(U-PEO)2 was recently achieved by L. Harvey, a novel molecule containing both as a bis-urea and an\r\nazobenzene, imparting 1D self-assembly through cooperative hydrogen bonding and light responsiveness, respectively. Two poly-(ethylene\r\noxide) arms (2000 g\/mol per arm) are linked to the core, providing isolated polymer bottlebrushes in solution, that are soluble in both aqueous\r\nmedia and some organic solvents. Light scattering and cryo-TEM measurements show that this system self-assembles into long nanocylinders\r\nin water (several hundreds of nm long, Nagg = 900), and are disrupted upon irradiation. It is however mandatory to carry out SAXS\r\nmeasurements to study the polymer bottlebrush nanostructure in toluene as well as in mixtures of water\/DMSO, probed in absolute scale of\r\nintensity over a wide q range (like D2AM-ESRF SAXS-detector at 2.9m: q=0.0025 to 0.15 \u00c5-1 with WAXS overlap (det. 0.3m: q=0.08 to 1.4\r\n\u00c5-1 ) as already tested ; idem SWING-SOLEIL).","86":"We want to use high-resolution crystallography to continue or do new fundamental research on: 1) the oxygen-sensitivity of metalloenzymes and metalloproteins; 2) maturation proteins involved in the biosynthesis of metal sites in hydrogenases and nitrogenase; 3) SAM radical enzymes; 4) the biological assembly of iron-sulfur clusters; 5) the role of quinolinate synthase in NAD biosynthesis; 6) transduction of signals like oxygen and NO by Fe-S cluster-dependent transcriptional regulators. Our main goal is to improve our understanding of structure-function relationships such as those determining oxygen sensitivity and oxygen-tolerance of Fe-S clustercontaining proteins, those involved in the catalysis of important biochemical reactions and those involved in Fe-S cluster-dependent signal transduction. More distant goals include the design and production of improved and\/or artificial metalloenzymes, facilitating their use for biotechnological applications.","109":"Understanding the lithium storage mechanism of alternative and novel anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial in order to elevate LIB technology towards the next generation. We, therefore, aim to unravel the de-\/lithiation mechanism of Nb2O5 anodes when used between 3.0 V and 0.01 V, i.e., exploiting the entire active potential range - which offers enhanced specific capacities, but has not been elucidated in detail so far. Interestingly, the specific capacity can be boosted even further via Bi doping, which has so far never been reported as well. Spectra in the XANES region from operando XAS measurements will provide information about the electronic structure and the changes in oxidation state of the electroactive species. The longer ex situ EXAFS measurements will provide complementary information on the local structural changes around the two absorbers, and the results are expected to contribute to the difficult task of realizing next-generation LIBs.","111":"The idea of producing a crystalline alloy with good properties based on a heavy mix of elements was completely new and pushed the boundaries of properties understanding beyond what was known so far from one- and two-element based alloys, leading to the discovery of High Entropy Alloys (HEA). A general lack of experimental data on the crystal structure and local distortions in HEA \u2013 all factors considered crucial for the understanding of mechanical properties \u2013 emerges from the latest reviews. This project plans to tackle directly some of these aspects: a bcc alloy, so-called Senkov alloy based on Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Hf elements, and its precursors, will be investigated by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The results will be then related to i) mechanical properties to be measured on the same compounds and integrated with the literature, and ii) on-going crystal structure investigation on similar hcp-based and fcc-based high entropy alloys.","120":"We aim to elucidate the Li storage mechanism of Nb2O5 when de-\/lithiated in the range of 0.01-3.0 V, which offers almost twice the capacity compared to the common range of 1.0-3.0 V. Interestingly, Bi doping increases the initial capacity even further. Previously, we have performed an ex situ study on Bi-doped and neat orthorhombic Nb2O5 at selected potentials of the 1st and 2nd cycle, and the results show that the storage mechanism is very complex. Since ex situ samples are single data points, the operando measurements are highly complementary. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: (i) Are the ex situ results confirmed by the operando results? (ii) How do the species change in-between the ex situ data points and (iii) what is the exact role of Bi? In addition to the 1st cycle, we will also perform an operando analysis of the 200th cycle. The results will (iv) shed light on the fading mechanisms and are, thus, essential for the further improvement of such materials.","122":"The idea of producing a crystalline alloy with good properties based on a heavy mix of elements in near-equiatomic stoichiometry, leading to the discovery of High Entropy Alloys (HEA) was completely new and pushed the boundaries of properties understanding beyond what was known so far from one- and two-element based alloys. In the context of high entropy shape-memory alloys related to Ti-Zr-Hf-Co-Ni-Cu-Pd, and its precursors, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will be used to investigate bond distances between selected pair of elements. The structural phase transition between martensite and austenite states will be analyzed, i.e. the fundamental mechanism on which shape-memory-effects are based. Finally, a broader comparison of this system in its austenitic phase will be carried out with data already acquired in previous experiments on hcp-based (Ti-Hf-Zr-Al-Sc) and fcc-based (Al-Cr-Co-Cu-Fe-Ni) systems, for a better understanding of crystal structure properties in HEAs altogether.","141":"In paleoenvironmental archives such as peat and lake sediments, bromine (Br) generally show some correlation with organic matter (OM), but the relationship between Br and OM is not linear. The Br\/OM ratio has been proposed as a proxy of the origin of historical primary productivity (macrophytes vs planktonic). We hypothesize that Br speciation could be a finer paleoenvironmental proxy. To test this hypothesis, a better understanding the cycling of Br in sediments and of chemical changes occurring during burial and sediment diagenesis are needed. This proposal is a continuation of exp EV373. We wish to complement our dataset of Br K-edge bulk HERFD-XANES spectra, with sediments at low Br content, and sources compartment.","143":"We propose to study the Cu speciation in a chronosequence of low-Cu acidic soils characterized by increasing vine age, which received repeated inputs of Cu-based fungicide. Copper accumulated in the surface horizons of all studied soils whereas Cu migration towards depth was only observed for the oldest vine (>72 years). Furthermore, isotopic analyses on the Cu-fungicide and the three soil profiles revealed unexpected results and a large isotopic variability. Our aim is to (1) study the temporal evolution of speciation of Cu from the fungicide after deposition on the vineyard soils and (2) investigate the drivers of Cu redistribution processes and the dominant bearing phases responsible for Cu mobility with depth in the soil profile. Due to the very low Cu concentration in soils, from 2 to 120 \u03bcg.g-1, we propose to combine XANES and EXAFS analyses to decipher the fate of Cu in vineyard soils affected by long-term Cu-fungicide application.","164":"Crystalline ceramics have been suggested as potential immobilization matrices for high-level radioactive wastes generated in the late stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. Lanthanide orthophosphate ceramics have been shown to be excellent candidates for the incorporation of trivalent dopants such as Cm3+, Am3+, and Pu3+. It is further known, that monazites can accommodate tetravalent actinides. Their incorporation requires coupled substitution reactions, which preserve charge neutrality within the phosphate ceramic structure, such as An4+ + M2+ = 2 Ln3+. This can be achieved via varius synthesis routes. For U4+ and Th4+, several records of successful substitution exist. In contrast, for Ce4+ acting as an analogue for Pu4+ it has been argued that incorporation is extremely limited due to a change in the oxidation state. In the present study we aim at understanding such redox phenomena in Ce-doped phosphate phases at elevated temperatures.

The rheological properties and oil binding capacity of the resulting oleogels are largely influenced by the fat crystal network. Therefore, it is important to investigate the melting and crystallization behavior of the crystalline oleogelators. In this project, different oleogelator types (waxes, monoglycerides (MAG) and diglycerides (DAG)) will be used. During the production, the gelator concentration and type as well as the shear rate and cooling rate will be adapted to investigate the effect of processing on the formation of the fat crystal network.

Improved power conversion efficiency of OPV has resulted in part from optimized processing protocols - influencing changes in microstructure, governing device performance. In the context of quantities probed via GIWAXS; molecular orientation plays a significant role in light absorption and molecular ordering affects charge carrier transport and recombination.  Templating layers can induce a different crystalline polymorph and preferred molecule orientation in overlayers. A class of materials already successfully implemented in solution processed OPV as both a charge transport layer and a morphological template is self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). This proposal aims to investigate SAMs in a VTE OPV context, quantifying the molecular changes that the SAM induces.

However, their complex cycling mechanisms, involving multiple transitions between crystalline and amorphous phases, make them challenging to understand based on chemical structures even with the most advanced operando techniques [1]. The purpose of the proposed experiment is to understand the cycling mechanisms of two conversion\/alloying materials for Na-ion batteries (Bi2MoO6 and Sb2S3) by combining operando PDF and XAS with the new and improved setup at BM31 (to be installed this summer). ","210":"Cu-exchanged zeolites have proven to be good candidates for direct conversion of methane to methanol (DMTM), with Cu-mordenite (Cu-MOR) zeolite being exceptionally well suited for this task. Recent studies suggest the oxygen in the synthesized methanol to originate from the water rather than the O2 of the initial activation step. Furthermore, preliminary results from our group focusing on the activation of C-H bonds in lower alkanes (\u2265 C2) over Cu-MOR, find no apparent differences with respect to the activation atmosphere (O2 or He). Therefore, with in situ XAS experiments, we want to monitor the Cu-species and track small variations in the local environment of Cu formed during the activation in different atmospheres (O2, He, H2O). This study promises to shed more insight on and facilitate a better understanding of the nuclearity of the active sites in relation to the methanol productivity, a crucial step for the further improvement of the DMTM reaction.","213":"In this project, by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and pair distribution function (PDF) measurements, we aim to probe structural, electronic, and morphological dynamic changes in In2O3-based catalytic systems used for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

The hydrothermal conditions during APR lead to changes in metal oxidation state,  re-dispersion and dealloying of the catalyst nanoparticles. Thus, operando XAS and XRD studies will be conducted to determine the local environment, dispersion and metal phase of Pt and Mn in samples prepared by different synthesis methods. The experiments are expected to give insight into the catalyst changes during the reaction, which may lead to deactivation. It will provide crucial information used in the rational design of APR catalysts to improve the catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.

By conducting ex situ as well as in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments to identify the speciation of these bimetallic catalysts especially under working state, we expect to elucidate the interplay between structure and catalytic performance for Rh-based catalyst and the active site for ethanol formation. The outcomes of this proposal will enable to rationally design the next generation of catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, which would have an important impact on decarbonizing our economy.","226":"Active materials for anodes of Na-ion batteries operating under conversion\/alloying mechanisms offer higher capacities than conventional intercalation materials but struggle with stability over many cycles. Their complex cycling mechanisms, when a material undergoes through a series of transformations combining crystalline and amorphous phases, make them challenging to understand on the basis of chemical structures even with the most informative operando techniques [1,2]. This experiment will focus on two main groups of materials: Bi and Sb-based compounds for Na-ion batteries.  Both types of materials create amorphous phases during cycling that we want to characterize with operando PDF to get a more complete understanding of their cycling mechanism. To do this we want to employ the use of multivariate analysis, allowing the separation of signals for easier analysis. For the Bi and Sb compounds, we also want to use operando XAS (XANES and EXAFS) to obtain element specific information.

On the one hand, Cr as foreign element at the interface was detected by the SEM and TEM analysis. On the other hand, it was possible to show that many LSCF grains at the interface show differences in their elemental composition. While it was possible to analyze the elemental composition of the impurities at the interface via TEM, so far the local crystal structure of the impurities \/ changes could not be revealed.  Therefore the extraordinary lateral resolution of the X-ray Laue microdiffraction could be the key analytical tool to clarify, if the local change in chemical composition also leads to a structural change of the material, e.g. LSCF locally transforms from a perovskite to a Ruddlesden-Popper \/ double perovskite structure.

We have developed a new strategy for generating hybrid crystals, where we have found that the addition of small amounts of organic solvents to the crystallisation medium facilitates the occlusion of high levels of additives in crystal hosts (calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and manganese carbonate). With the ability to precisely tune the composition of the hybrid crystals, we now have a unique opportunity to investigate their structure\/composition relationships. HR-PXRD will be used to determine how the crystal lattice is affected by the occlusions.

Pulsing between and within capacitive, Faradaic, and catalytic conditions in CO2-containing and CO2-free electrolytes will allow us to differentiate between the bulk lattice response to the charged state, the surface chemistry and active state of the catalysts. Our comparative studies using size-selected Ag and Au particles will allow us to draw more general conclusion on the dynamics of catalysts under electrochemical conditions.

This is motivated by the interest in further understanding the unique adsorption behaviour of this MOF, which involves a combination of interaction of the guests with both open coordination sites on the metal atoms and fluorine atoms from the organic linkers, accompanied by a concerted rotation of the aromatic rings upon insertion of the guest species, as suggested by in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy, in situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.","318":"Recently it has been shown that hydrogenation reactions at 4 - 10 GPa afford unique all-hydrido hypervalent [SiH6]2- complexes in the crystalline hydridosilicates A2SiH6 (A = K, Rb).

Their bonding properties closely relate to those of the recently discovered superconducting phases PH2 and H3S. The latter shows a record high Tc of 203 K. However, these binary phases can only be observed at ultrahigh pressures >100 GPa. At the same time, switching to ternary systems can lower the synthesis pressures down to several GPa.

HR-PXRD has been already exploited (ID22) with the known isomorphous Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4-bis(pyrazol-4-yl)benzene] [1], unveiling the CO2\/framework interactions. The same experiment on Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 will enable us to unveil its CO2 adsorption sites and host-guest interactions, thus disclosing the role of the NH2-function in the adsorption process. Also through a comparison with the HR-PXRD results obtained on Fe2(BDP)3, this experiment will allow a deeper understanding of the improved CO2 separation properties we observed after amino functionalization.[2] This will also open the way to the design and synthesis of improved, new generation adsorbents.","338":"This proposal aims to develop new multidimensional operando synchrotron methods for studying Li-ion batteries (LIBs).

These calculations predict the stability of crystalline pCO phases that were never experimentally attained, probably because of the kinetic hindrance of this transformation.

A second experiment [CH-5458] revealed anisotropic lattice dynamics driven by photoinduced CT small-polarons. Here we propose to develop time-resolved serial crystallography for studying non-reversible processes by using a fresh powder sample for every laser shot. This will allow studying the global out-of-equilibrium dynamics, from the formation of CT small-polarons, to cooperative and macroscopic phase nucleation.

Such experimental conditions were recently found to trigger the formation of monovalent Ni species (Ni(I)), as observed by in-situ EPR results, which can catalyze H2 production without the need of a sacrificial agent or noble metal co-catalyst. Ni(I) formation is likely dependent on the presence in the reduced-TiO2 nanoparticles ('grey' titania) of surface Ti(III) sites, thus creating an artificial redox chain based on a monovalent nickel (Ni(I)) electron transfer relay. To corroborate the mechanism, we propose the use of High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD) X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the Ni and Ti K-edges, to study in operando the local electronic and atomic structure of Ti and Ni under photocatalytic H2 evolution conditions.","362":"Excellent performance of Cu-exchanged chabazite zeolites (Cu-CHA) as catalysts for NOx removal from exhaust fumes has very recently paved the way for these materials to the catalytic converters of the last-generation diesel cars.

To understand the mechanism of deactivation we need to investigate Cu-S species which are formed after interaction with SO2. This proposal aims to reveal the mechanisms of sulphur poisoning and regeneration of Cu-CHA zeolites at the molecular level, monitoring the electronic structure and local environment of sulphur by element-selective X-ray absorption spectroscopy during the in situ adsorption and desorption of sulphur.

Such system was selected due to its narrow 3-D pore structure, capable for effective capture and separation of Kr and Xe gas molecules. The monitoring of potential structural changes upon temperature\/pressure\/time-dependent adsorption in combination with the volumetric and theoretical studies is of a great importance for understanding the mechanisms of gas adsorption or\/and separation particularly in Al2O(MDIP) and the other MOFs in general.","368":"Nitridic compounds with mixed cations are a highly diverse class of compounds. They feature immense structural diversity and intriguing properties such as thermal and chemical stability and ionic conductivity. However, extreme reaction conditions which are conditional to their synthesis yield microcrystalline samples and structural analysis is challenging. Ta8PN15 with the rare motif of PN6 octahedra was successfully investigated at ID11. Further syntheses now afforded TM-nitridophosphates (TM = Ta, Mn, Cr, V) and according to powder patterns, TM-nitridosilicatephosphates (TM = Cr, Mn) are the first nitridic amphiboles. In all these cases, electron diffraction can identify new compounds but the combination of TEM and synchrotron diffraction from micron-sized crystallites outperforms electron crystallography or powder diffraction by far. This investigation will extend this field towards the chemistry of transition metal compounds with promising properties and rare structural motifs.","373":"The goal of this study is to identify structural descriptors for the catalytic performance of very small (1-2 nm) silica supported, Ni-Ga nanoparticles for the CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. Supported nanoparticles of small size (up to a few nanometers in diameter) feature different surface sites than their larger counterparts, leading to a distinct catalytic behaviour of such materials. To probe the structure of the NixGay\/SiO2 catalysts under reaction conditions and elucidate the origin of their favourable catalytic properties, we will use operando X-ray total scattering. The identification of structural similarities and differences with materials of larger particle size, will be key to advance our understanding of Ni-Ga based alloys and intermetallics for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.","377":"In the uranium-oxygen system an interesting interplay between the uranium charge distribution and crystallographic properties exists. The application of diffraction techniques allows to resolve the structural elements, whereas the assessment of chemical states is usually performed from spectroscopic methods, separate from each other. Ambiguity sometimes remains on the actual charge localization, especially in complex molecules. We propose to perform DAFS around the U L3-edge (17.170 keV) on mixed-valence uranium oxides, in order to obtain site-specific information on the chemical state of uranium. These type of experiments, further supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, can provide a unique and unprecedented insight on the charge localization in uranium compounds, which is invaluable information with respect to nuclear fuel material properties.","382":"Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process is an effective method to produce light olefins such as propylene. Recently we have discovered unusual propylene selectivity over Ca-containing zeolite catalysts. We assume that the interaction between Ca2+-cites and hydrocarbons occurs in a non-trivial way greatly affecting the MTO mechanism. However, the exact mechanisms behind destabilization of coke precursors and improvement of propylene selectivity remain poorly understood. Here we propose to perform operando XRD measurements at ID31 beamline. With the aid of operando XRD study, we expect to elucidate the difference in the zeolite unit cell parameters during the methanol-to-olefins reaction over Ca\/ZSM-5 catalysts, and correlate the change with gradual increase of hydrocarbons retained. The experiment will allow us to link the hydrocarbons evolution to the structural properties of the catalyst simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding to reveal the catalyst deactivation mechanism.","389":"Nickel coordinated within pyridinic nitrogen on a carbon backbone structure (Ni-N-C) has extraordinary electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ni-N-Cs can substitute platinum group metal (PGM) in order to reduce device costs. Synthesys for these electrocatalysts is based on pyrolytic processes with controlled temperature and atmosphere. The identification of the metal containing active sites and understanding of their formation during pyrolysis is crucial to enhance the M-N-C synthesis processes and active site reactivity. X-ray Adsorption Spectroscopy (XAS) will be used to reach our main goal, to define speciation of the Ni during pyrolysis, occurring at constant T (up to 800\u00b0C with 50\u00b0C step). This in-situ study, supported by ex-situ samples prepared at constant temperature, will: i) reveal the dynamics formation of Ni containing active sites during pyrolysis; ii) identify the temperature in which the desired active sites are formed.","392":"SION-X (Cu2[(BO)(OH)2](OH)3), in the form of copper (Cu) nanoparticles (NP), is a very promising self-healing and sustainable catalyst for hydrolysis and hydrogenation reactions of widespread industrial applications (production of polymers, dyes, pharmaceuticals, or H2 for energy applications). However essential properties, as the structure, coordination, and oxidation state of Cu in the NP remain uncharacterized. We therefore propose to investigate the oxidation state and local structural environment of Cu in the as such SION-X, and after two important catalytic reactions, by means of X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Cu K-edge.","396":"Cu-exchanged zeolites are the most studied materials for the direct conversion of methane to methanol (DMTM), a \u201cdream reaction\u201d with important consequences in the fields of environment, energy and resource management. Although the mechanism of DMTM is debated, Cu(I)\/(II) redox speciation, and especially Cu reducibility, plays a key role in this reaction. Currently, the main technique used to quantitatively assess Cu oxidation state in these materials is XANES spectroscopy. We have been currently developing a new technique to titrate Cu(I) on such systems, based on the specific interaction of CO with this species, that exploits isothermal volumetric adsorption as a quantitative tool. This methodology, however, could be affected by the lack of accessibility of Cu(I) ions by CO within the zeolitic framework. A comparison with a well-affirmed technique for the same quantification, as Cu K-edge XAS, is thus desirable.","397":"Emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel vehicles is a major contributor to air pollution around the world, especially in densely populated areas. To comply with NOx emission regulations, diesel vehicles are equipped with NH3- SCR catalysts, which is the most effective technology for mitigation of NOx emissions. However, catalytic activity of these materials decreases after prolonged exposure to sulphur, ever-present in the diesel fuel. This proposal aims to reveal the mechanisms of sulphur poisoning and regeneration of Cu-CHA zeolites at the molecular level, monitoring the electronic structure and local environment of active Cu centres by element-selective X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) during the in operando adsorption and desorption of sulphur under real SCR conditions. Obtained results will be crucial to optimise regeneration procedures for the catalysts, increasing thus their efficiency.","403":"Stimuli responsive materials that are able to twist, bend, deform, move or change their shape can find multiple applications in manufacturing of smart devices and\/or medicine. Spin-crossover materials are sensitive to light, temperature or pressure changes. Here we propose a comprehensive X-ray diffraction study of pressure-, temperature- and light-switchable materials. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of pressure-induced structural transformations and spin-crossover transitions, we propose to perform a series of comprehensive high-pressure (0.1MPa - 10GPa) single crystal diffraction measurements for 1D, 2D and 3D iron(II) coordination polymers.","404":"The aim of the proposal is the determination of the crystal structure of a multifunctional molecular material {[FeII(pyrazole)4]2[NbIV(CN)8].4H2O}n (FeNb) at low temperature and high pressure (up to 1 GPa) in order to understand the pressure-induced spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon and its relation to the magnetic and photomagnetic properties of this compound. The low temperature magnetic data for FeNb suggest that the observed pressure-induced SCO occurs in an ordered manner leading to the change of the ferrimagnetic ordering to the antiferromagnetic one and then to a paramagnetic state around 1.0 GPa. Each of these pressure-induced magnetic phases is expected to show a different photomagnetic response. The proposal will demonstrate for the first time the simultaneous control of the photoswitching properties of a molecular magnet using pressure and temperature. It will also form a basis for understanding the complex magnetic behavior of the studied compound at extreme conditions.","406":"This proposal is aimed at exploring the chemistry of Sb and N under extreme conditions, particularly focusing on the synthesis and characterization of antimony nitride. The study addresses fundamental issues about pnictogens chemistry and is relevant to the design and high pressure synthesis of new advanced materials.\r\n","413":"Linear olefins have attracted industrial attention as a basic feedstock and important intermediate in the production of polyethene and plasticizers. Butene dimerization on zeolite or metal organic framework supported Ni based catalysts represents an appealing route to selectively synthesize linear olefins from undervalued cracking fractions. Despite constituting isolated Ni sites, the rate of butene dimerization varies substantially depending upon the catalyst support and shows the following trend: Ni-FAU >> Ni-CHA > Ni-MFI >> Ni-UiO-66. We hypothesize that the local chemical environment and the electronic properties of Ni encapsulated in different supports impact the activation of butene thereby resulting in substantially different rates for butene consumption. We therefore propose to investigate the structural and electronic properties of Ni in a series of Ni-CHA, Ni-MFI, Ni-FAU, and Ni-UiO-66 catalysts, with varying Ni content, via HERFD-XANES, VtC-XES, and EXAFS measurements.","414":"We have prepared four variants of the NcAA9C LPMO copper enzyme: the wild-type and three mutants in which the gatekeeper residue Glutamine (Gln) has been substituted for Glutamate (Glu), Asparagine (Asn), or Aspartate (Asp). We wish to utilize Cu K-edge and EXAFS data to supplement interpretation and reconciliation of electrochemical, biochemical, EPR, and computational data which we have collected to evaluate the effect of gatekeeper residue identity on the stabilization of the Cu site in the +2 vs +1 oxidation states.","420":"Lead Halide Perovskites (LHP) colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) easily self-assemble into ordered Superlattices (SLs) exhibiting uncommon collective emission properties (superfluorescence). LHP SLs also show atomic interference between NCs due to alignment of atomic planes, manifesting as multiple fringes of\r\nthe 100 \/ 200 (cubic notation) X-ray peaks in 1D WAXS patterns. In our ongoing research on the topic, we investigate possible interplay between structural interference and collective emissive properties. Here, we intend to perform high-resolution in-situ and ex-situ combined 2D GIWAXS\/specular diffraction experiments on fully inorganic \/ hybrid LHP NC SLs, aiming at: i) monitoring self-assembly from the early-stages taking place inside the colloidal suspension upon slow-solvent evaporation, to the final dried film, possibly exploring in-plane and out-of-plane atomic interference; ii) studying atomic interference in binary SLs grown ex-situ as sub-micrometer thick films.","435":"To meet the global carbon neutral goals, the demand for clean energy and low carbon footprint industrial processes is growing rapidly. There is particular interest on development of NH3 stores as reversible hydrogen source due to its excellent gravimetric\/volumetric hydrogen density. We seek to develop novel ammonia storage systems and request 4 days on ID22 to study the preferred binding sites and locations of adsorbed gas molecules within three porous Cu-MOFs (MFM-100, MFM-101 and MFM-102). The high resolution and in situ gas loading apparatus of ID22 make it ideal for analysing the phase transition, dynamic behaviour and host-guest interactions associated with these processes in these porous MOFs as demonstrated by our recent research collaborations with ID22 scientists. This proposal will provide key structural information on how NH3 are captured and stabilised within the pores of these porous MOFs.","439":"The main goal of the proposed experiments is to determine the structure and evolution of phases in novel Co-CeO2 catalysts prepared by flame-spray pyrolysis.\r\n These materials are promising catalysts for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ hydrocarbons. Operando XRD and PDF experiments during H2-TPR and reaction in\r\n CO2+H2 mixture will be performed. The investigation of the structural properties of Co-CeO2 formed in the course of reduction will allow establishing the\r\n structure-activity relationship for this promising catalytic system. This information is necessary to identify the role of active Co-sites and support. Overall these\r\n experiments will be instrumental in designing the next generation of active and cost-efficient catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into value-added C2+ hydrocarbons.","443":"We propose to explore Compton scattering in the simplest molecule (H2) in the gas phase in the molecular frame of reference. The experiment will yield the first 3-dimensional Compton profile of a molecular orbital (in the molecular frame of reference) for a gas-phase molecule. We will also investigate how the Compton profile of one electron is altered by excitation of the second electron in H2 via electron-electron correlation. In order to perform the experiment we will bring a COLTRIMS Reaction Microscope with a truck from Frankfurt and install it for one week at ID31. We had two beamtimes before the shutdown with our transportable specialised endstation, which yielded three publications in Phys. Rev. Lett. demonstrating the power of our multi-particle coincidence technique.","449":"Natural circular dichroism is the principal tool used to characterize chiral compounds. For this reason, the terms chirality and optical activity are often used interchangeably. However, these terms are distinct, which can be most clearly appreciated by comparing optical activity in the UV-visible range and in the X-ray range. Theoretically speaking, there are some enantiomorphic and UV-active crystal space groups where optical activity in the X-ray range is forbidden, while there also exists non-chiral space groups for which X-ray optical activity is allowed. As whatever is not forbidden must be observable, we here propose to record, for the first time, X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism (XNCD) for crystals belonging to the XNCD-active, but achiral and nonpolar, crystal class -42m.","458":"We plan to investigate by in situ XAS the surface of a Pt anode during the Kolbe electro-oxidation of aqueous carboxylic acids. Under reaction conditions, the Pt surface is conditioned, and develops a \u201cbarrier layer\u201d which provides high selectivity towards alkanes, while the undesired water oxidation reaction to oxygen in suppressed. We propose to use in situ XAS to investigate (i) the formation and composition of the barrier layer and (ii) the surface structure of the Pt electrode during the Kolbe oxidation of aqueous carboxylic acids. This information, yet unknown to date, is crucial to improve the process selectivity and to develop alternative electrodes composed of earth abundant non-noble materials.","462":"Recently, we have developed a new electrochemistry which may greatly enhance energy density in aqueous zinc battery system. To be specific, tellurium or selenium, which are both chalcogen, is used as active material of cathode. At high working voltage, anion storage could be triggered by applying high-concentrated electrolyte. Meanwhile, traditional cation storage could also be used at low working voltage. Impressively, this 6-electron electrochemistry brings high capacity beyond 1000 mAh g-1 which will further enhance performance of aqueous battery. In this proposal, we intend to use in-situ XAS to probe into changes of valence state and coordinate state of our active materials during charging and discharging, thus to understand the mechanism behind. Our studies will provide significant knowledge on electrochemistry of anion storage. ","470":"Metallocenes are the family of MCp2 (where M - metal ion and Cp - cyclopentadienyl ring,) compounds that have been serendipitously discovered about 70 years ago and ignited a new branch of chemistry: organometallics. Although its first-synthesized, most stable and most well-known representative, ferrocene, has been thoroughly investigated over decades, its phase diagram and pressure behaviour have been only recently explored. Nickelocene is one of the isostructural analogues of ferrocene. Although, resembling ferrocene molecular and crystal structure, it does not comply with 18-electron rule, which in consequences gives huge instability of the system, structurally manifested in a significant elongation of metal\u2013cyclopentadienyl ring organometallic bonds. We would like to explore pressure-driven transformations and reactivity of nickelocene. Due to the relatively large instability of nickelocene, we also expect its higher reactivity under pressure when exposed to high pressure.","473":"Our international community of researchers was awarded four shifts in proposal 2844 on the HED instrument of the European XFEL in June 2022 to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of high-pressure nitridation reactions in diamond anvil cells. The aim of the proposed synchrotron experiment\r\nis to perform a post-synthetic analysis of the samples studied at the EuXFEL. Synchrotron radiation and single-crystal XRD will provide more detailed structural information about the synthesized materials. ","479":"We propose to investigate ultrafast, complete and non-reversible photo-induced phase transitions by using the \"streaming crystallography\" methodology developed during our previous beamtime on ID09 (CH-6162). This enables to investigate photo-transformations within the hysteresis, by performing time-resolved X-ray diffraction on continuously-refreshed crystals. First results in Co-doped Mn(III)Fe(II) Prussian Blue Analogues microcrystals revealed full conversion towards the Mn(II)Fe(III) phase after 650 nm excitation, driven by elastic deformations involving cooperative symmetry and volume changes. A deeper analysis of the underlying mechanisms is however necessary, as both phase front propagation and global crystal expansion can intervene. Here we propose to further investigate this point by tuning the excitation wavelength, switching from surface-only to bulk absorption. Additional measurements on PBAs with different Co doping rates will allow modulating the elastic energy cost.","488":"U M4,5-edge RIXS measurements are proposed to study the electronic structure and bonding of air-sensitive non-aqueous model complexes that have been\r\n synthesised to broaden knowledge of 5f orbital contributions to actinide frontier molecular orbitals. The selected series of molecular U complexes will be used to\r\n trace out the sensitivities of RIXS to coordination geometry and metal-ligand covalency. Particular attention is directed towards lower oxidation states U(IV) and\r\n U(III). The model complexes selected show evidence from density functional theory of covalent bonding involving the 5f orbitals. The results will be relevant to\r\n nuclear waste clean-up and recycling processes.\r\n","491":"Photoresponsive MOF materials are exciting candidates for various applications, including, but not restricted to, controlled gas capture\/storage\/release. We have utilized the state-of-the-art gas-phase atomic-molecular layer deposition (ALD\/MLD) thin-film technique to incorporate fully functional photoresponsive  linkers into a crystalline metal-organic matrix. The ALD\/MLD synthesis yields in-situ crystalline iron-azobenzene\/stilbene thin films which provide a suitable environment for the efficient trans-cis  photoisomerization reaction to occur. Here, we  aim in ex-situ 1s2p RIXS measurements at the iron pre-edge region of various photoresponsive metal-organic thin-film samples. Our goal is to gain understanding of the changes in the local environment of iron when these materials are reversibly irradiated by UV and visible light, and to relate the structural changes to changes in the materials\u2019 properties.","493":"This work will shed light on the stabilization mechanism of Pt-Ni-based electrodes in acid media using ionic liquid by collecting Ni HERFD XANES and EXAFS spectra under potential control. The first part of the experiment will be devoted to the stability studies, where in the second part we will investigate the role of ionic liquid on electrooxidation and reduction of Ni.  ","495":"We will use SAXS and WAXS to study the particle size, porosity and atomic structure of hard carbon (HC) from various sources under working conditions in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). HC is one of the most promising anodes for SIBs and can be produced by the pyrolysis of several inexpensive organic by-products. Surprisingly, the electrochemical performance of the HC is very dependent on the feedstock used to produce it. This experiment will help us to understand the differences between HC prepared from different feedstocks and the extent to which they are linked to porosity and structure.","503":"The use of metabolic MRI has many clinical advantages and especially in identifying tumours at an early stage. However, the difficulty in obtaining a strong enough magnetic signal impedes its common use. For this MRI technique to work one needs to take advantage of the polarization of a metabolite which is unfortunately naturally only 1ppm. Here we propose to overcome this limitation by \"conjugating\" the desired metabolite with an inorganic mineral, in which the polarized state exhibits a relatively long relaxation time, and thus may serve as a spin reservoir and, via the process of spin diffusion, elongate the relaxation time of the metabolite. Hench, incorporating metabolites such as pyruvate into the lattice of a crystal should allow a much longer relaxation time and could potentially allow much longer and better imaging. Herein we will study the effect of incorporation of metabolites into the calcite on its lattice (ID22) and correlate it with polarization relaxations. ","504":"The interaction between DNA and biominerals is of key importance, as over the centuries it is known to enable the preservation of the organic molecules, encoding the hereditary information, and even give hints to origin of life. Herein, we propose to study the interaction of CaCO3 with  nucleotides \u2013 the building blocks of DNA and RNA and to study how they get incorporate into the lattice of CaCO3 and what is the affect of this incorporation on the lattice. HR-PXRD measurements will allow us to study the interaction of single nucleotides as well as full DNA strands with inorganic CaCO3 crystals. We will be able to unravel the parameters which govern the incorporation of such molecules into the inorganic crystalline structure. This research can elucidate how such interaction enables the preservation of DNA over the years, as well as the use of CaCO3 in gene-realted medical applications such as gene targeting. ","507":"This project aims to improve our understanding of degradation phenomena in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) catalysts using operando scattering techniques. With the present proposal, we will combine two AST protocols for operando measurements, to make them more comparable to a \u201creal-life application\u201d and at the same time reduce the required measurement time substantially. We will apply the new concept of operando SAXS \/ WAXS measurements in a grazing incidence configuration allowing \u201ccatalyst-depth depending\u201d information. We will compare a bimodal Pt\/C catalysts with the respective monomodal catalysts. The combination of operando SAXS \/ WAXS measurements and ex-situ TEM analysis will be used to develop fitting models that will allow us to obtain probability functions similar to size histograms obtained in TEM analysis. Most importantly the model should not require the assumption of log-normal size distributions that does not take degradation phenomena into account.","509":"The use of high energy X-ray diffraction is proposed to investigate operando the fine structure-activity-stability trends of carbon-supported platinum-rare earth (Pt-RE\/C) nanoalloys during the electrochemical conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

The electroreduction of CO (CORR) to fuels is one of these technologies. C1 (methane, methanol) and C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol, propanol etc.) can be produced via the electroreduction of CO, derived from CO2 or CO-rich waste streams [1]. CO is a key intermediate in the C2+ products formation during widely studied CO2RR. Using CO as a feed gas is a novel approach and improves the selectivity towards C2+ molecules. Cu is the only element active for C-C coupling but exhibits low selectivity [1,2]. The addition of Ag is reported to promote the presence of residual Cu2O in the catalysts important for C-C coupling [3]. We prepared and studied several Cu-Ag catalysts with varying compositions with improved catalytic performance towards C2+ products. Our goal is to investigate the impact of Ag on the performance of these Cu-based catalysts by WAXS.","516":"The understanding of covalency in the chemical bonding between transition metal ions and anions or molecules (ligands) is critical to a vast number of disciplines. We have recently demonstrated that direct experimental evidence of magnetic moment delocalization, i.e. covalency, onto chloride ions in paramagnetic molecules can be obtained through the observation of XMCD at the chlorine K edges. In this proposal, we will (1) expand this methodology to determine the covalency in the paramagnetic [ReBr6]2\u2013 as a function of secondary coordination sphere of the molecular entities, and (2) determine the relative covalency of Cl and P in the mixed ligand trans-[ReCl4(PPh3)2]. Experimentally, this information is accessible from the combined analysis of the XANES and XMCD at the Re L2,3, Br K, Cl K, P K edges \u2013 all of which are reachable at ID12. In a nutshell, both subprojects aim at establishing XMCD as a means for assessing covalency parameters in transition metal complexes and materials.","527":"We have prepared samples of the C\u2013H activating Cu metalloenzyme Cbp21, an AA10 LPMO which participates in the depolymerization of chitin. The samples feature protein which is either bound or unbound to chitin in the Cu(II) and Cu(I) oxidation states. Furthermore, we will prepare turnover intermediates under monooxygenase conditions, and isolate these sample via freeze quench methods. The successful collection of Cu K-edge XAS\/EXAFS data will provide insight into the perturbation of the Cu site upon substrate binding, as well as mechanistic insight into the LPMO during mono-oxygenase turnover. We intend to utilize a fluorescence detected-XAS configuration with multi-element, high-sensitivity detector and cryostat available at BM23.","535":"Monitoring changes in catalyst composition and structure during operation is of the utmost importance to derive unambiguous structure\/function relationships, and to guide the design of better catalysts. Our aim is to follow and elucidate changes of oxidation states, structure and coordination environments in Cu-In electrocatalysts during the CO2 reduction reaction by operando XAS. Cu-In materials have been recently shown to exhibit enhanced catalytic performance. We have recently established a synthetic framework which allows the tuning of the morphology of Cu-In nanoparticles, serving as a perfect tool to elucidate structure\/property relationships reliably. Lab-based electrochemical tests have established that the product distribution varies greatly as a function of these morphologies and differs from monometallic Cu and In catalysts of the same size, and synchrotron-based XAS studies are needed to further rationalise the sources of the performance variation.

The BPPs under investigation consist of a conductive carbon filler, crystalline graphite, and polypropylene binder. As a first goal of the current proposal, we would like to study the influence of conductive filler type on the inner structure of the BPPs and correlate the structure with electrical conductivity. These BPPs need to be (electro-)chemically resistant to avoid corrosion. Therefore, as a second goal of the experiment, we want to conduct ex situ experiments on corroded BPPs to probe structural changes taking place from the surface towards the bulk in order to gain inights on the corrosion mechanism. To summarize, we are investigating the degradation of BPPs upon electrochemical corrosion and developing novel carbon materials to improve their lifetime and thereby, the efficiency of VRFBs in the current project.","546":"Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly modular, porous, crystalline polymers. While COFs have several applications, most are synthesized as unoriented aggregates of nanoscale crystallites. Overcoming this challenge, our new synthesis uses a modulator and transimination catalyst to yield single-crystalline, imine-linked 2D COFs in under five minutes as compared to existing month-long syntheses. However, the polymerization itself is not yet well-understood. To investigate key reaction parameters, we will systematically vary our growth conditions and monitor COF formation in situ by ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering at ESRF ID02. We hypothesize that COF single crystals form via simultaneous polymerization and crystallization processes, unlike polycrystalline COFs that polymerize much faster than they crystallize. Collectively, such insights into COF growth will enable rational design of synthetic conditions for single crystals of next generation 2D polymers.","552":"Cu-exchanged chabazite zeolites (Cu-CHA) are excellent catalysts for NOx removal from the exhaust gas of diesel vehicles, via the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 to N2 and H2O (NH3-SCR). However, these catalysts deactivate upon exposure to SO2, that is formed from the sulfur-containing compounds in the diesel fuel. As we showed in our recent paper using XANES, EXAFS and XES data from BM23 and ID26, SO2 reacts predominantly with the [CuII2(NH3)4O2]2+ complex, and the other Cu-species in the NH3-SCR cycle remain virtually unaffected. To better understand the impact of SO2, it is important to look at the interaction between the catalyst and NO after exposure to SO2. In the proposed experiment we will reveal the influence of SO2 on the interaction between NO and Cu-CHA by monitoring the reaction of the [CuII2(NH3)4O2]2+ complex with NO in situ before and after exposure to SO2.","555":"Cost efficient and long-term stable catalysts are in great demand for the CO2 hydrogenation to methane, a key process involved in conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals and fuels. Recently we prepared Ni-doped ceria nanoparticles 3.5 times more active than conventional Ni-supported on ceria. After a detailed in-situ NAP-NEXAFS study we demonstrated the formation of tetrahedral (Td) NiO sites on the surface of ceria nanoparticles which are less reducible (in H2) than standard octahedral (Oh) NiO. However soft X-ray measurements are challenging at operando conditions (1 bar of gas) while Ce M4,5- and Ni L-edge did not give access to structural and electronic variations in a reaction-time scale. Therefore we propose here an operando hard X-rays XAFS\/DRIFTS of the two aforementioned catalyst to unlock Ni-Ce synergic electronic and structural behavior coupled with the precious IR information on the formed reaction intermediates finally aiming to describe the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism. ","558":"\tIn recent years, a fundamental debate over the spectroscopic signatures- and by extension the very existence- of Cu(III) centers has emerged. We have recently validated the interpretation of Cu(III) as a formal oxidation in molecular complexes in a detailed X-ray absorption and Valence-to-Core emission (VtC XES) study. Our recent work motivates us to further explore not only other debated Cu(III) centers, but also to push towards even higher oxidation-states. For several decades now, cesium hexafluoridecuprate (Cs2CuIVF6) has been the only know example of a formal Cu(IV) ion; however, it lacks spectroscopic investigation. We will measure the Cu XAS and XES signatures of a series of copper fluoride salts in various oxidation states to provide some of the rarest examples of high-valent copper spectroscopy.","571":"Exsolution method for the synthesis of supported nanoparticles is gaining much more attention since its enhanced catalytic properties, longer life-time and coking resistance. Titanate-based materials have been largely explored for the exsolution from B-site of reducible non-noble metals\/alloy and they cover a wide range of applications. The choice of metal is strictly connected with the final use of the catalyst; therefore, we identified the nature of the dopant(s) in B-site a key role to elucidate in the nanoparticle formation.\r\nHereby, we propose to investigate the exsolution mechanism in a general system (La0.5Sr0.5)1-xTi1-xMxO3 where x = 0.10. We will investigate both single-metal M (= Ni, Cu) and bimetallic (M_(x\/2)^' M_(x\/2)^'') systems involving Ni, Cu and Fe.

The processes forming the Brazilian world-class lateritic deposits of Seis Lagos (2.81 wt% Nb2O5) and Catal\u00e3o-I (1.22 wt% Nb2O5) will be assessed and compared. Unlike the Catal\u00e3o-I deposit and most Nb deposits worldwide in which pyrochlore is the main ore (type-1 deposits), the Seis Lagos laterite is characterised by an elusive Nb speciation defined by neoformed Ti, Fe and Ce oxides (type-2 deposits) that formed from the alteration of primary Nb minerals to de identified. \u03bc-XAS and \u03bc-XRD spectra will precise Nb speciation in these lateritic deposits. The ore minerals observed in situ will be compared to the Nb average speciation and to the quantitative mineralogy obtained by bulk analyses.

Using an analogue of the Early Earth \u2018seawater\u2019, we followed the formation and transformation of GR and greenalite in the absence and presence of As and P. The combination of As and P is crucial because As(V) is a key competitor for phosphate, but highly toxic to all living cells. To assess to what extent the formation pathways of GR and greenalite in these early oceans would have shaped As toxicity and thus P bioavailability can tell us about how these processes affected the evolution of microbial processes (photosynthesis) and, ultimately, life as we know it today.","766":"The existence of alkali-bearing carbonates in deep mineral inclusions and the presence of K-rich carbonatitic melts in the upper mantle raised the attention to the role of potassium within the Earth's deep carbon cycle.

Specifically, the liquid structure will be investigated by angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction, while density will be extracted by the quantitative analysis of both liquid structure and absorption profile. The density obtained by both methods will be compared to verify the robustness of density extracted from liquid structure analysis.

This hypothesis can only be verified by detailed observations of the anatomical structures - intracranial articulation, histology of the dermal spines and fine anatomy of the scales - in synchrotron light. The anatomy and morphological characterization of this specimen will enrich an ongoing project on the evolutionary characteristics of coelacanths, that is, their monotonous or highly derived anatomy and body plan, and the genetic and developmental causes at the origin of these life traits.","791":"Pursuit of sustainable agrifood production has been driving the emergence of precision agriculture. Foliar application of nanomaterials (NMs) for nutrient delivery allow to directly target the plant, limiting soil inputs, waste, and environmental degradations. However our understanding of the fate and behavior of NMs after their foliar deposition (bioavailable species, NM-leaf interaction, routes of uptake and translocation) remains limited. We are studying the impact of various Zn-based NMs, on their foliar uptake and bioavailability when deposited to pepper plants leaves. The NMs tested are bare ZnO NMs and surface modified ZnO NMs with Zn3(PO4)2. The phosphate shell is meant to study if a less soluble coating will enhance Zn bioavailability through surface charge modification and\/or change the ionic release on the leaf. In this proposal we propose to fstudy the route of foliar uptake of the bioavailable Zn species, their translocation and their transformation inside the leaf.","797":"Deformation in the Earth\u2019s crust localizes onto faults that may rupture rapidly producing earthquakes, or undergo slow aseismic slip that may or may not accelerate into coseismic slip.

This phenomenon termed \u2018fatigue\u2019 is crucial in studies focusing on the evaluation of extensive storage of CO2 relying on shales as an efficient sealing caprock. Shale rocks suffer cyclic loading during drilling, leading to possible near-well fracturing. In addition, thermal stresses may arise during these cycles due to the expansion cooling of the injected CO2. All these processes may affect the mechanical stability of such geological formations. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the response of the rock mass under cyclic loading conditions. The proposed experiment aims to investigate in detail the fatigue damage evolution in rocks due to the cyclic loading expected for the rock mass through the lifetime of a CO2 storage operation by using dynamic in-situ X-ray imaging using the Hades apparatus.\r\n","966":"Multiphase flow in porous media is a scientific topic of huge environmental importance, and recent advances in X-ray sources and detectors have made it feasible to study this field experimentally. Many liquid-liquid fluctuations take place on a time scale of seconds, with the pore-level Haines jumps occurring within milliseconds. It is consequently difficult to follow these processes with time-resolved 3D microscopy. Due to the short time scales, 3D imaging of these pore-scale phenomena has hitherto been limited to snapshots before and after the process has taken place. We thus propose original measurement strategies for i) real-time 3D imaging of steady-state multiphase flow fluctuations, and ii) reversible Haines jumps. We expect that these efforts will improve our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of multiphase flow, specifically testing recently published theoretical models for multiphase flow.","967":"","969":"Further investigations on Hg speciation in tree barks","986":"This study aims to be the first investigation of the dispersion of tellurium (Te) in the environment around areas naturally enriched in Te, testing the hypothesis that biological processes are important.

","991":"The new EU regulation on cadmium (Cd) concentration in cocoa-derived products affects the cocoa market worldwide, especially in Latin-America, and requires the development of mitigation strategies. The potential for postharvest Cd mitigation during fermentation was recently highlighted. Data suggest that cacao fermentation induces a mobilization of Cd in the cacao nibs (the inner part of the bean), followed by outward migration of Cd from the nib to the testa (the shell) and the mucilage. It is hypothesized that Cd mobilization during fermentation is related to breakdown of phytate in the nibs and consecutive release of phytate-bound Cd. Bulk XANES analysis can offer crucial knowledge to identify whether this correlation between phytate breakdown and nib Cd mobilization is causational or not. This knowledge can lead to the development of post-harvest techniques to reduce the Cd content in cacao beans.","992":"With a predicted world population of over 9 billion people in 2050 and rapid economic growth, the pressure on natural resources is exponentially increasing.

In the context of a circular economy, this project aims at extracting REEs from a secondary source: bauxite residue produced from alumina extraction. This project proposes to develop environmentally sustainable extraction processes (soft physico-chemical and bio-inspired processes) with thorough characterization of the waste including metal speciation. We propose here to investigate bulk speciation of Yttrium (proxy for Heavy REEs) in bauxite residue samples formed from 2 bauxite sources (lateritic and karstic origins) as well as in the residue after partial leaching of Yttrium to better understand leaching mechanisms and how speciation affect leaching yield. ","1003":"Tropical weathering of ultramafic rocks leads to the formation of nickel (Ni) laterites in which iron (Fe), Ni and chromium (Cr) are enriched across a weathering profile. In the case of Cr, the hexavalent species, Cr(VI), is a highly mobile and toxic pollutant. Cr(VI) can often leach into groundwaters, making it crucial to understand the processes that control its mobility. Fe (oxyhydr)oxides are usually the main mineral phase in the most weathered zones of Ni laterites, and are critical hosts for Cr species. However, their role in the redox behavior and partitioning of Cr species, as well as the mechanisms involved in sequestration or release into (ground)waters is unknown. To address this, we will probe the speciation and local bonding environment of Cr in both natural Ni laterite samples and synthetic analogues using Cr K-edge XAS. Thus, we can quantify speciation changes along a vertical redox gradient in Ni laterite profiles, and evaluate Cr leaching potential into groundwaters.","1005":"We aim to characterise the dispersion and speciation of cobalt (Co) in rocks and regolith samples around relatively undisturbed natural anomalies. Cobalt cycling is well-studied in only a few environments such as in marine (Mazzotta et al., 2021),  and lateritic (Newsome et al., 2020) but poorly studied in surface environments. Currently, cobalt is obtained primarily from mine wastes and tailings piles (Dehaine et al., 2021) \u2013 meaning humanity is becoming increasingly reliant on mine waste processing as the demand for Co in batteries for electric cars and other applications surges. However, soluble Co is toxic in high concentrations to a range of biota. We aim to produce a model of the controls on Co mobility and toxicity in the regolith. This natural analogue study aims to improve our ability to predict the long-term fate of Co introduced into the environment because of expanding anthropogenic uses, along with managing the fate of resource-grade Co in mining waste piles.","1009":"Due to the large quantity as residual mineral waste, municipal solid waste incineration - bottom ash (MSWI-BA) is an interesting secondary raw material that can be utilized for road construction.

In a previous study, we performed a long-term leaching test of MSWI-BA in a lysimeter for almost six years to investigate the efficiency of the treatment process on the release of hazardous substances. While concentrations of chloride, sulfate and the majority of the heavy metals started to decrease rapidly with progressive liquid-to-solid ratio (L\/S), the ecotoxic hazardous elements antimony (Sb) and vanadium (V) behaved differently.

This proposal aims to perform a very accurate structural analysis at low temperatures of Eu2Pd2Sn in order to understand the origin of a soft-phonon-like excitation at around 25K observed in specific heat measurements. In particular this analysis could unveil if around that temperature a progressive change of structure between the high temperature orthorhombic and the suspected low temperature monoclinic polymorph occurs.

In fact, we recently revealed how Mn-substitution is able to pin a CDW in Fe-based SC, adding a new fundamental ingredient to explain their physics. By means of Mn substitution, we are confident to reveal if an incommensurate modulation (marking a CDW state) characterizes also the crystal structure of FeSe.\r\nThe aim of the present proposal is to determine the occurrence of a possible incommensurate structural modulation in pure and very lightly Mn-substituted FeSe .","1076":"We seek to study low-temperature crystal structure of glaserite-type Na2BaCo(PO4)2 that was recently proposed as a candidate material for quantum spin liquid, an exotic state of matter with highly non-trivial electronic properties.

We surmise that this geometry may be in fact distorted as a result of cooperative rotations of the CoO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, and shall challenge this conjecture by high-resolution and total-scattering measurements at ID22.

This, however, represents only one of the two types of collective charge modes in the cuprates. As well as the three- dimensional plasmon, t-J model calculations also predict the presence of a spin polaron excitation, which is a lower energy mode that arises from the formation of a narrow polaronlike band of spin correlation dressed bosons. This proposal will use Cu L-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of La2-xCexCuO4 (LCCO) to discover the spin polaron excitation and characterize its momentum and doping dependence.

However, neutron scattering does not provide insight into the orbital character of these excitations. It is widely believed that interactions responsible for the Mott insulating state are encoded into this orbital texture. With the improvements provided by the ERIXS spectrometer, it is now possible to probe both orbital and spin excitations simultaneously in Ca2RuO4. We therefore propose to study the low-energy spin-orbital excitation spectrum of Ca2RuO4 via the oxygen K-edge at which ID32 delivers an energy resolution just below 30 meV.\r\n","1090":"Observations from space probes strongly support the presence of dissolved ionic species (e.g. Mg, Na, Cl, SO4) in deep oceans of icy moons like Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus and Titan to pressures of several GPa.

However important, this discovery does not answer all questions on persistent luminescence and electron transfer between metal dopants in general. A significant hurdle that is yet to be taken is explaining how the charge is transported between the (photo)redox partners.

Less direct signatures of the pseudogap have been found in measurements other than ARPES, but the determination of T* is there not univocal. This is a problem in materials where ARPES cannot be performed, such as YBCO. We propose to use very high resolution RIXS to study the opening of the superconducting gap and of the pseudogap in YBCO.

We aim to obtain reliable quantitative data that is necessary to further understanding of the behavior of similar simple network forming glasses under ultra-high pressures.The proposed research will have strong interdisciplinary implications including the studies of density and local structural changes in the silicate melts under extreme pressure conditions of the deep Earth.","1148":"Warm dense matter describes plasma at very high densities in which long-range coupling between particles cannot be ignored. Due to the difficulties in both creating and diagnosing such matter, the theory of its behavior is underdeveloped, yet it is pervasive throughout the universe. This proposal uses a unique combination of pulsed power to produce warm dense matter conditions, and the radiographic capabilities of ID19 to provide quantitative measurements of dynamics in these plasmas. We will significantly improve upon our initial research from 2018, measuring how the electrothermal instability could affect measurements of resistivity in dense plasmas, hoping to explain fundamental questions in conductivity modelling; explore how the Richtmyer Meshkov instability is affected by plasma density, which is key to Inertial Confinement Fusion; and in new experiments study how the Kelvin Helmholtz instability forms in counterpropagating plasma flows, like those observed in stellar outflows.","1151":"We propose to continue our investigation of the structural anisotropies in bulk metallic glasses with X-ray nano-diffraction. Our initial experiment at ID16B revealed large and unexpected structural anisotropies discovered by analyzing the full 2D diffraction pattern. The patterns showed large intensity variations as a function of the azimuthal angle. The results of the studies we propose on several samples with different growth conditions and degrees of stability can inform the relationship between the observed anisotropies and important properties of metallic glasses, pointing to the need to have structural information beyond the density-density pair distribution function.  Further, these studies may provide new information relevant to the glass transition, a long-standing open question in condensed matter physics.","1165":"Ferroelectric superlattices have recently emerged as the main platform for exploring novel ordered polar phases (e.g. domain supercrystals, polar vortices and skyrmion lattices), with interesting topologies and novel functionalities (e.g. negative capacitance). While state-of-the-art aberration corrected electron microscopy can provide useful information about the local polarization, much less is known about the response of these unusual polar structures to temperature and applied fields. We propose to use the scanning x-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) capability at ID01 to study the complex superdomain structure, its evolution under applied field, and phase transitions in PbTiO3\/SrTiO3 superlattices under tensile strain.","1172":"The proponents' recent discovery of molecular rotors (Nature Chem. 2020, 12, 845) which can retain their fast dynamics down to very low temperature, such as 2 K, with nearly negligible activation energy (as low as 6 cal\/mol), led to a rich multiplicity of distinct rotary phenomena, mirrored in NMR relaxation complex profiles. Now we have reached a neat advancement by inserting ultra-fast dipolar rotors in metal-organic framework  (MOFs) of the family of frustrated trigonal rotors (FTRs), generating fast responsive and switchable ferroelectric materials for memories and electrically driven optical devices. Therefore,  it would be challenging to detect order-disorder transitions of such new dynamical materials at extremely low temperatures by synchrotron-source X-ray diffraction. Moreover, identifying rotor conformations, occupation of specific sites and symmetry changes as a function of temperature  will help explain unprecedented mobility and the mechanism of motion in the solid-state.","1174":"Sr5xBa5-5xNb10O30 (SBN) is a ferroelectric material crystallizing in an unfilled tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB, general formula (A1)2(A2)4C4(B1)2(B2)8O30) structure, with three species (Sr, Ba and a vacancy) distributed over the A1 and A2 sites, resulting in inherent disorder. The cation distribution directly affects the ferroelectric and dielectric properties of SBN, and can even be used to tune the material properties. Thus, it is important to characterize and quantify the cation disorder. However, with this configuration of cations (two sites and three species), the occupancies of all species on both sites are impossible to retrieve from a single X-ray diffraction experiment. We intend to perform high-resolution resonant scattering on SBN with selected compositions (x = 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.61) at different temperatures (T = RT, 300, 800, 950 \u00b0C) to overcome the limitation of conventional powder diffraction, and accurately quantify the cation disorder in SBN.","1178":"Near equiatomic composition, FeRh bulk alloys exhibit a CsCl-type (B2) chemically ordered phase related to a metamagnetic transition from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) to a ferromagnetic (FM) state close to ambient. This first order metamagnetic transition is generally interpreted in terms of the collapse of induced Rh magnetic moment at low temperature. The objective of this proposal is to study thermally driven chemical order transition and magnetism in bi-metallic FeRh nanoalloys. To reach this purpose, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism (XAS\/XMCD) experiments on ID12 will be performed at both Fe K-edges and Rh L-edges on in-situ UHV annealed mass-selected FeRh nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in amorphous carbon matrix. These results will allow us to describe local structural and magnetic evolution for each specific element as a function of FeRh clusters size.  ","1184":"Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) has been a premier tool in the study of cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Spectrometers with increasing energy resolution near the Cu-L3 edge have been able to detect and study several states and excitations below 1eV energy-loss, including magnon, and paramagnon excitations, and static charge order and its dynamic excitations. With the advent of energy resolution better than 35 meV at the Cu L3-edge, it has been possible to study the bond stretching phonon mode at ~70meV and its coupling to the electronic charge order. We recently performed Cu L3 RIXS on a cuprate superconductor and discovered a never before reported mode with sub 1eV energy. There are many possibilities for its origin, including charge, magnetic or lattice excitations. We propose to investigate the physical origin of this mode by leveraging the unique capability of ERIXS to resolve the polarization of the scattered photon.","1185":"Several theoretical proposals suggest that the microscopic origin of the superconductivity in high Tc cuprate superconductors might reside in the modulations of the electron density. However, charge density waves (CDW) demonstrated over years a clear competition with the superconductivity: they weaken below Tc and are enhanced by magnetic fields. The recently discovered charge density fluctuations (CDF) might instead represent the long-sought excitations, since their signal is not reduced below Tc. Here, we propose to study in YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 films the response of CDW and CDF to magnetic fields of the order of 1 T, which we will achieve using an optimized geometry with two permanent magnets and a concentrator, and that we already tested to induce a significant variation in the charge order signal. Depending if CDW and CDF behave differently or not, we will be able to say if they have a common nature or instead if CDF might be regarded as a possible candidate to drive the pairing. ","1191":"Pressure induced amorphous to amorphous transition in covalently bonded substances with open local structures have been extensively studied over the years. However, this is not the case for amorphous metallic glasses with closely packed local structures and high coordination numbers. Pressure induced local structural changes in these densely packed disordered systems and its correlation with the anomalous pressure behavior are still poorly understood. We aim to take a further step into this issue by investigating the pressure behavior of closely packed local structures in a simple system, binary Ni62Nb38 metallic glass. We propose to use EXAFS, an element selective technique and ideal probe of local structures in amorphous systems. The goal of the current project is to improve the current understanding on the pressure behavior of closely packed disordered systems, a matter of importance for basic and applied sciences.","1193":"The rare-earth iridates, with general formula A2Ir2O7 (A = rare-earth ion), crystallise in a pyrochlore structure. They display a wide range of exotic magnetic and electronic low temperature properties, dependent on the specific rare-earth ion, due to the inherent magnetic geometric frustration of the rare-earth and Ir4+ (J = \u00bd) corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices. Surprisingly however, initial magnetic ordering of the Ir4+ sublattice appears to be primarily dependent on the A ion size (and hence the interatomic distances\/compound\u2019s lattice parameter), rather than the rare-earth\u2019s specific electronic properties. To investigate this relationship, we propose to measure the lattice compressibility and the structural evolution with pressure of several A2Ir2O7 members, to allow proper interpretation of property measurements under pressure. We request beam time to use synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, in a DAC.","1196":"Superconducting cuprates universally have a propensity towards charge ordering. Superconductivity and charge order (CO) show an intricate competition that can be tuned by external parameters such as magnetic field, hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure. Experiments under uniaxial compression have revealed that a dramatic nonlinear suppression of the superconducting Tc favors a long-ranged 3D CO. For now, large pressures have been applied to YBa2Cu3O6.67 (Tc=65 K), a doping at which CO is strongest in the absence of pressure. However, the doping dependence at high pressure remains to be investigated. During our recent x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment on YBCO6.67 under uniaxial compression, we have followed the evolution of 2D CO and the emergence of the 3D CO state while simultaneously monitoring the modifications of the lattice. Here we propose to extend our study to different dopings and to investigate the CO in uniaxially strained YBa2Cu3O6.55 (Tc=60K) and YBa2Cu3O6.80 (Tc=82 K). ","1199":"We propose to study the evolution of the charge density wave (CDW) under hydrostatic pressure up to 15 GPa in a canonical 3-dimensional (3D) CDW transition metal dichalcogenide, VSe2. We have previously observed that van der Waals interactions account for the prevention of the CDW formation at high temperature and its temperature dependence of the CDW is described by anharmonic effects. Here, we intend to track the pressure and temperature dependence of the elastic CDW peak in VSe2 and obtain the critical exponents as a function of pressure as the van der Waals forces get suppressed and the anharmonic effects induce the quantum melting of the charge density wave. ","1203":"Polynitrogen (poly-N) compounds have been actively pursued driven by their potential as ultrahigh-performing propellants and explosives. Thus far, the binary systems' investigation for poly-N species was largely limited below 125 GPa, and never has the threshold above 200 GPa been breached\u2014although theoretical calculations predict even more exotic N chemical arrangements to be synthesized. This proposal aims to explore the terra incognita that is poly-N chemistry in the multimegabar regime by probing laser-heated Ca-N and Sr-N systems up to 240 GPa, employing the single-crystal X-ray diffraction from the polycrystalline samples (SC-XRDp) technique for structural determination. Of great fundamental physicochemical interest, the discovery of novel high pressure poly-N species is also indispensable as targets for lower pressure syntheses. ","1237":"The insulator-metal transition in RNiO3 (R is rare-earth) has revolutionized the fields of condensed matter physics along the last 30 years, aiming to unveil the mechanisms behind the localized-to-itinerant transition in those strong correlated electronic systems. Most studies were devoted to perovskites with 4f R ions; however, little is known on R ions with fully occupied orbitals in the trivalent state, as the case of Tl3+. Here, the main goal is to study the crystal structure evolution across the N\u00e9el temperatures (TN = 125 K and TN* = 202 K) and the insulator-metal transition (550\u2013600 K) in TlNiO3 perovskite nickelate using the state-of-art high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffractometer at D22. The questions to be addressed here: what is the critical temperature for the insulator-metal transition in TlNiO3? Is the its lattice sensible to display magnetoelastic coupling at the reported N\u00e9el temperatures? A precise high-temperature phase description of TlNiO3 is highly requested.","1240":"With the proposed experiment we aim to perform pair distribution function (PDF) analyses on 16 samples belonging to the Ce1-x(Nd0.74Tm0.26)xO2-x\/2 and\r\nthe Ce1-x(Nd0.63Dy0.37)xO2-x\/2 systems (x= 0.05-0.60). PDF analyses will be performed to gain information on the local structure of the present systems, trying to unravel the non-trivial relationship between their ionic conductivity and local structure. In fact, in Ce1-xRExO2-x\/2 systems (RE= trivalent rare earth ion), the high ionic conductivity observed between 673 and 973 K at low dopant amount is strictly related to the structural properties, even at the local scale, and to the occurrence of defect aggregates. Consequently, an in-depth structural study is fundamental to evaluate the chemical nature and the amount of the doping ions giving rise to the most efficient electrolytes for a possible application in solid oxide cells working at the intermediate temperature range.","1271":"Gas hydrates are crystalline hydrogen-bonded water frameworks encaging gas atoms or molecules at high gas densities. Hydrates of natural gas occurs on the sea floor on Earth and hydrates of astrophysically relevant gases are candidate components for the interiors of the icy bodies of the outer Solar system. Due to its high weight percent of hydrogen, H2-hydrate is also a promising material for solid hydrogen storage, and pressure is a key parameter to explore this direction as it promotes novel stoichiometries with increased storage capacities as well as increased temperature ranges of stability. We propose to explore the stability and the structures formed by the H2-hydrate in the 50 GPa-150 GPa pressure range by x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cell. Based on published calculations and by analogy with the high-pressure behaviour of CH4 hydrate, we expect that this system forms a new high-pressure structure above 50 GPa which will be stable in the Mbar range.","1277":"The many families of cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTSC) have common electronic properties besides superconductivity, but possess structural and chemical differences that can complicate the identification of those universal features that are necessary for the understanding of the superconducting mechanism. All cuprates show a propensity towards quasi 2D short-ranged charge ordering (2D CO) that competes with superconductivity, however a long-range 3D CO state has so far only been observed in YBa2Cu3Oy (YBCO) after application of high magnetic fields (B>20 T) or uniaxial pressures that are able to weaken superconductivity (SC).\r\nThe aim of the current proposal is to explore whether uniaxial pressure strengthens 2D CO in single layer tetragonal HgBa2CuO4+x (Hg1201) similarly to YBCO and whether strain is eventually able to induce a 3D CO state. This proposal would benchmark whether 3D CO is a universal feature relevant for cuprate HTSC.","1280":"We plan to use laser-heated diamond anvil cell to measure the phase diagram of tin in the 1-2 Mbar range, with a focus on relative stability of hcp vs bcc phase. In fact, static\/dynamic compression under close P-T conditions (~180 GPa) seem to produce different hcp\/bcc phases. We aim at determining if compression rate, or non-hydrostatic stress, have an effect on the phase adopted by this metal under stress.","1283":"The search for materials harder than diamonds is one of the holy grails of material sciences. Many candidate compounds have been suggested and carbon nitrides are among the most compelling.1,2 As it stands, none of the high-pressure experiments on the C-N system resulted in the full structural determination of a new carbon nitride. Here, we propose to employ the extremely powerful method of single-crystal X-ray diffraction of a polycrystalline sample (SC-XRDp) to characterize the reaction products of a laser-heated carbon-nitrogen precursor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE, C6N4), between 20 and 130 GPa. The compressibility and stability range of the produced carbon nitrides will be determined. Preliminary experiments show the synthesis of a new compound.","1315":"Our work is devoted to the study of the interplay between gas adsorption and dynamics in Metal Organic Frameworks. We developed a novel class of MOFs endowed with ultra-fast rotors with energy barrier as low as 6 - 20 cal\/mol. We explored the modulation of rotational dynamics by guest species, that can be effectively applied to drive a dramatic response of the dynamic properties in the solid state. Moreover, gas adsorption could also trigger structural rearrangement of MOF structure that can affect the rotational behaviour of molecular rotors. In our endeavour to fabricate switchable ferroelectric materials and porous dynamic materials for ultra-low concentration gas detection, it would be of extreme importance the study of the interplay between gas adsorption, molecular rotors dynamic and structural phase transitions. Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction would provide fundamental information about the structure of MOFs both at variable temperatures and under gas pressure.","1316":"The rare-earth iridates, with general formula A2Ir2O7 (A = rare-earth ion), crystallise in a pyrochlore structure. They display a wide range of exotic magnetic and electronic low temperature properties, dependent on the specific rare-earth ion, due to the inherent magnetic geometric frustration of the rare-earth and Ir4+ (J = \u00bd) corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices. Surprisingly however, initial magnetic ordering of the Ir4+ sublattice appears to be primarily dependent on the A ion size, rather than the rare-earth\u2019s specific electronic properties. To investigate this relationship, we have measured the lattice compressibility and the structural evolution with pressure of several A2Ir2O7 members at room temperature and 20 K (ESRF, ID15b, HC-4856). To corroborate our very recent results, the temperature evolution of structural parameters is proposed to be investigated. We request beam time to use synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and ID22 diffractometer.","1336":"Recent resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies have revealed low-energy plasmon excitations in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, highlighting their relevance for the normal state and superconducting properties. Moreover, the plasmonic charge excitations in cuprates are well described by the t-J-V model with long-range Coulomb interaction, providing a new way to determine the charge dynamics and related electronic energy scales. Here, we propose to apply this sensitivity of RIXS to study the newly discovered infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. From the plasmon spectra we will determine the parameter set that describes the low-energy physics of the nickelates, which is so far missing. In this fashion, key questions including their similarities to the cuprates, especially the strength of electronic interactions can be addressed. Furthermore, by following the evolution of charge excitations as a function of Tc, their roles in superconductivity will be examined.","1426":"The proposed experiment focuses on exploring the phase diagram of the novel iron oxide, Fe5O6, using Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction at high-pressure and low-temperature conditions (up to 100 GPa and down to 20 K).

The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the wholly uncharted W-C-N system between ambient pressure and 130 GPa using laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DAC) and synthesize novel ternary compounds. To realize this aim, the crystal structure of the newly synthesized compounds, along with their corresponding synthesis conditions, will be elucidated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of polycrystalline samples.

However, there is no general consensus on the origin of ferroelectricity in these materials, and our understanding of the composition-structure-properties relationship is further complicated by the complex modulations, octahedral tilting patterns and mixed occupancy that is also known to exist for this class of materials.

We propose to characterize through \u00b5-XRF\/\u00b5-XANES analysis the chemical speciation and stratigraphic distribution of compounds in artificially aged CdY model paints prepared with pigments synthesized by different historical methods, to provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of degradation in relation with the manufacturing process.

Our goal is to study the colour change by looking at several glass production parameters, by using experimental glasses, that follow the composition of Post-Roman archaeological glass fragments from Tintagel castle (UK). Using bulk and micro Fe and Mn K-edge XANES combined with micro XRF spectroscopy will enable the characterisation of the oxidation state of Fe and Mn in fragments produced using different parameters, and the study of the dichroic character of the archaeological samples.

Due to their stunning properties, they are recently been studied for several biomedical applications. However, little has been reported about the fate that these nanoparticles follow once they have performed their function in the human body and this aspect is essential if they are to be used for clinical applications. In this experiment, we aim to study the long-term intracellular degradation process that magnetosomes undergo in 3D models (spheroids) of human lung carcinoma cells (A549) by tracking the structural and electronic changes that Fe atoms undergo by means of Fe K-edge XANES spectroscopy. In parallel, the degradation of iron oxide commercial nanoparticles designed for biomedical applications will be studied to compare with that of magnetosomes.","2816":"In order to control their high redox activity, in living systems Cu ions are normally coordinated to proteins and short peptides. One of the main functions of Cu in biology is as a catalytic redox centre in enzymes where the role of Cu is often to activate dioxygen. The coordination chemistry of Cu(II) and Cu(I) bound to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are very different (e.g. in the case of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Similar differences in the coordination chemistry is also reported in the Cu-\u03b1-synuclein that is related to Parkinson disease. Such flexible Cu-IDP are quite competent in di-oxygen activation to form reactive oxygen species, which could contribute to the oxidative stress observed in the diseases.Hence a central question is how this redox process can occur. In fact, going from Cu(II) to Cu(I) and back needs a quite important rearrangement of the peptide around the Cu-ion. Answering this question is the main goal of the present proposal.","2818":"Many insects rely heavily on polarisation vision navigate through their world but we understand little about the features of their visual systems that underlie this behaviour, partly due to the lack of methods for resolving photoreceptor structures in 3D. The aim of this project is to take advantage of the recently developed nano-tomography technique, well established at ESRF, to create high resolution 3D models of the fine structures of insect eyes. With this beamtime we will describe, for the first time, the 3D structure and orientation of the dorsal rim area (DRA) which is part of the eye used primarily for navigation by sensing polarized light. The work will provide the first nanoscale 3D reconstructions of insect eyes and provide new insights into how this important compass cue is sensed by insects. If successful, our results will also lead to the first publications using nano-tomography to describe the fine detail of animal eyes.","2821":"The goal of the experiment is a full 3d quantitative analysis of the dentate gyrus (DG) region in human hippocampal tissue, and pathological changes of the 3d structure due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In particular, we firstly want to test the hypothesis that AD is accompanied by changes in neuron structure, density and packing in the DG, and secondly whether amyloid plaques are linked by filamentous connections. For this purpose, we will use the unique capabilities of ID16a as a world leading instrument for full field 3d high resolution phase contrast, in combination with advanced iterative phase retrieval and segmentation algorithms.","2824":"Aim of the project is to assess the structural properties and evolution of scaffolds prepared by electro-spinning or force-spinning intended to enhance cutaneous wound healing of chronic lesions and burns. The composition and preparation protocol have been formulated in order to obtain scaffolds insoluble in aqueous fluids, suitable to support cell growth, migration and proliferation, while providing protection of the lesion from microbial contamination and an optimal hydration and gas exchange, crucial for healing. The scaffolds are based on biocompatible and bioactive natural polysaccharides, initially dissolved in water, with no need of any organic solvent, thus meeting the guidelines of green chemistry. We plan to compare the basic scaffolds, in the form of flat or tubular objects, with loaded ones, added with nanoparticles with phyllosilicates, hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and antimicrobials (ZnO NP, Ag, Cu NP) intended to improve the environment conditions for tissue repair.","2831":"The knowledge of the carcinogenetic and cytotoxic mechanisms of asbestos in living organism is still uncomplete, also due to a lacking characterization of the asbestos modifications during its prolonged stay in the biological tissue. To gain new knowledge on the structural modifications of asbestos, and on the chemical composition of the asbestos bodies (i.e. the ensemble of the original asbestos and of the Fe-coating it develops in the tissues), we propose to perform single crystal nano-XRD measurements on Asbestos Bodies (AB) and Asbestos Fibers (AF) recovered from the lung tissues of exposed workers by a non-invasive approach based on their magnetic properties, and on AB and AF still embedded in the original lung tissues.  ","2844":"Campaniform sensilla  are among the most sensitive mechanosensory organs in the animal kingdom; however, we currently lack high-resolution anatomy that would reveal the biomechanical principles that underlie their remarkable sensitivity. Here, we propose to use X-ray phase contrast nanoscale tomography to image several hundred mechanosensory organs on the wing and haltere of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Imaging these structures at 50 nm resolution will allow us to analyze how campaniform sensilla sense mechanical forces produced during flight. This will represent a major step toward understanding the biological design principles that underlie mechanosensation.","2855":"Crocodilians and their closest living relatives appeared in the Late Triassic. Major questions still remain about the growth strategies and tissues of these ancient crocodilians. Answering these questions is key for understanding the evolutionary history of living crocodilians and requires sampling broadly across fossil crocodilians using osteohistological methods. A challenge for this line of research is that classical osteohistology requires destructive sampling, and early crocodylomorphs are rare components of the fossil record. Synchrotron microtomography offers a non-destructive alternative to destructive approaches and has already shown great promise in imaging internal bone microstructures. In this study, we propose to use PPC-SR\u03bcCT at submicron voxel size to image osteohistological cross sections of the long bones of four key fossil species from South Africa. This study builds a framework for understanding growth strategies across Crocodylomoprha and other vertebrate clades.","2857":"Meat-eating dinosaurs (therapods) exhibit ziphodont teeth: serrated, blade-like teeth with cutting edges comprised of a series of \u2018denticle\u2019 structures. We have recently observed extraordinary levels of structural organisation of the crystallites that form these features in tyrannosaur teeth. To extrapolate structure-function relationships we need to study modern analogues unaffected by fossilisation. We will study the teeth of Komodo dragons \u2013one of the only living reptiles with similar features. In this experiment we wish to understand whether specific elemental distributions that are observed in fossil samples are important to the Komodo denticle structure or are an artefact of fossilisation. ","2871":"Copper is an essential trace element in humans and therapeutic approaches based on the interaction of synthetic ligands with Cu attracted considerable medicinal interest. For instance, Cu-ligand complexes (Cu-L) are intensively investigated as anticancer agents. An often-implicated mechanism of cytotoxicity in cancer cells is the increased production of reactive oxygen species catalysed by the Cu-L. This can occur in the presence of native reductants, such as ascorbate or glutathione (GSH), under aerobic conditions. Based on the literature and our recent results, the lysosome might be an important place of action for these Cu-L. Moreover, the GSH oxidation by Cu-phenanthroline complexes increased at lower pH, such as the typical lysosome value 5. Therefore, the present project aims to understand why the catalytic activity increases at lower pH. This is of fundamental interest as thiol reactivity normally drops with pH and this finding could be of importance in the anticancer mechanism.","2888":"The large diversity of metal complexes provides attractive platforms for anticancer drug design. We recently synthesized iridium(III) and gold(III) complexes that inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro.

We propose to undertake correlative studies combining chemical imaging of cells by Synchrotron Radiation X-Ray Fluorescence (SR-XRF) with molecular imaging by optical microscopy to uncover their spatial distribution at the organelle level.","2903":"SARS-CoV-2 is an encapsulated virus responsible for a lethal respiratory illness since its outbreak at the end of 2019. Interestingly, the fusion domain of the spike protein triggers the fusion between viral and host membranes, initializing the infection. However, the molecular mechanism regulating this process has not been deeply understood. Our approach to date has been to study the interaction of several putative fusion peptides at or near the N-terminus of S2 subunit with model membranes in the form of monolayers, composed of cholesterol and natural lipids extracted from yeast cells. A  combination of different X-ray surface scattering methods available at ID10 beamline (XRR, GISAXS, and GIXD) will help to answer questions still not answered such as how does the fusion region induces the reorganization of the lipid packing, as well as, how is the fusion process modulated by lipid composition and environmental factors such as the presence of divalent cations.","2937":"The CarH photoreceptor is a light-activated transcription regulator and it is a promising target for optogenetic applications. We have recently shown that structural changes in CarH after light absorption can be followed by time-resolved X-ray scattering (LS-2958). To disentangle tertiary and quaternary signals, we performed a second experiment ( LS-3091) on a mutant (H132A-CarH) and a homolog of CarH in which quaternary changes are prevented or modified, respectively. The previous experiments enabled us to follow the cascade of structural events occurring in CarH on a time scale from \u00b5s to hundreds of ms. A comparison with static data showed that the relevant time scale of the photoreaction in native CarH extends longer than hundreds of ms, most likely because of the presence of large scale slow quaternary changes leading to the photoproduct. Here we propose to complete our study by collecting time-resolved scattering data in native CarH on the time scale from ms to several s.","2944":"Several peptides and proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyloid-beta in Alzheimer\u2019s or alpha-synuclein in Parkinson\u2019s disease are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) and can bind Cu to form Cu-IDP complexes. These Cu-IDP are able to catalyse the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of a reducing agent (ascorbate) and dioxygen. This ROS production needs the redox cycling between the two redox states (Cu(I), Cu(II)) and is thought to contribute to the neurodegeneration.\r\nIn the proposed project we propose to perform variable temperature XAS measurements in which we photoreduce Cu and then perform XAS experiments at different cryogenic temperatures in order to capture and characterize the intermediate redox states of Cu-Amyloid \u03b2 and Cu-alpha-synuclein.\r\n","2958":"The goal of this proposal is to perform a multimodal imaging of the neuronal Robo1 cell receptor with Slit2. Slit proteins and their cognate binding partners, the cell surface Roundabout (Robo) receptors family, are one of four major neuronal developmental guidance cues pathways. The implication of Slit-Robo signalling in other fundamental biological processes also makes it an attractive therapeutic target. However, while Slit2 and Robo1 are well studied there are still open questions about how Slit binding triggers Robo signalling at the cell surface. More recently, we have recombinantly produced several Slit2 constructs, including an uncleavable version (Slit2-U), all incorporating a 6xHis tag. We propose to screen these to identify the minimal version of Slit2 necessary for Robo1 endocytosis, and the cellular effect of a Slit2-U. Next, we would like to determine if Slit2 is internalised with Robo1, and if so, its cellular location and correlate this with Robo1 light microscopy.

The identification of MB in extinct species would provide an objective means to recognize gravid females. However, reports of fossil MB-like tissues are contentious because MB resembles avian bone pathologies (BP). Recently, our team made progress establishing criteria unique to MB, with the goal of discriminating it from BP. We studied MB and BP in over 60 bird species and found that i) MB skeletal distribution is linked to pneumaticity, differing from BP; ii) MB microstructure is uniform among neognaths and small paleognaths, but may differ in large ratites, the most ancestral bird species; iii) some avian BP have a similar molecular composition as MB. In light of our discoveries, our project aims at reassessing the nature of purported MB-like tissues in pterosaurs and non-avian dinosaurs using Synchrotron X-ray imaging.","3044":"Linking structure, kinetics and ultrasound propagation in deforming granular matter","3045":"In situ imaging of damage evolution during non-proportional load path changes","3046":"Dynamic fracture in implanted silicon wafers","3047":"Ultrafine eutectic alloys for a new generation of metals for additive manufacturing","3049":"Investigation by 3D nano-imaging of the healing ability of a new Al alloy","3051":"A deep insight into the intracellular fate of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals in a invertebrate model: a focus on in vivo nanoparticle ","3052":"","3055":"","3057":"","3059":"","3061":"","3062":"We aim to investigate the strain fluctuations induced by TiN electrodes in epitaxial Si\/SiGe quantum well (QW) heterostructures for housing of spin qubits.

Qubits are operated at cryogenic temperatures, while the strain is dependent on temperature due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion. Thus measurements at low temperature are necessary to determine the strain distribution which will affect the qubit. We will compare the experimental results with Finite Element (FEM) simulations based on an edge-force model.

These steels have exceptional ductility and strength, making them candidate materials for automotive structural components. However, the mechanisms responsible for their properties are complex and not well understood. Observing in-situ deformation in 3D will provide a new capability to measure and understand how stress localisation and grain neighbour interactions trigger or supress twinning and\/or phase transformations. The proposal is complementary to far-field 3DXRD investigations at Diamond Light Source, which we are leading. It will deliver a greater understanding of the relationship between localised crystallography, grain morphology, mechanical state, position and neighbouring crystal environment of austenite grains during their transformation to the martensite phase.","3075":"The experiment aims to reveal the microscopic physics of how metals break. It is well known that ductile failure takes place by nucleation, growth and coalescence of voids, yet the microscopic understanding of interaction between void evolution and the local structure is lacking. The deformation microstructure is a hierarchical organization with grains comprising subgrains of varying orientation and stress. Recently we have generalized 3DXRD for studying sub-\u00b5m sized subgrains. For its first application, we propose to map all subgrains in a relevant volume of a deformed Al polycrystal and correlate with a 3D movie of the void dynamics from tomography.  This correlation will allow us to identify the origin of failure. Expected results will guide the theory with respect to how microstructural features affect failure. Specifically, these results will be compared to crystal plasticity simulations extended by a dilatational model of void growth and serve as a guide for model development.","3077":"This proposal aims at unveiling the chemical reactivity of nanoparticles in inorganic liquids, ie. molten salts, which are highly relevant to design new materials for electrocatalysis applied to energy conversion. Because these liquids operate between 300 and 700\u00b0C, they require special approaches in order to probe reactions in situ. Herein we want to understand structural transformations of metal nanoparticles when they react with boron and phosphorus in molten salts, and to evidence the formation of new solids with potentially high impact for energy conversion. In situ time resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering (PDF analysis) will enable evaluating the composition and temperature ranges where intermediates and new solids, including amorphous phases, form and then crystallize during the reaction. These data will unveil new solids and nanomaterials and provide the first understanding of reaction mechanisms into molten salts.","3078":"The proposed research aims at characterizing the process of plastic strain localization and its propagation in the bulk of polycrystalline Ni using a combination of X-ray diffraction imaging techniques.

The experimental data will give access to the temporal and spatial evolution of slip bands and enable assessment of the influence of the local grain neighborhood on propagation of plasticity throughout the 3D grain microstructure during early stages of plastic deformation (0-2 %). The collected data will also be used for subsequent 3D simulation work (crystal plasticity and dislocation dynamics) by the project partners.","3083":"Lead-free antiferroelectric (AFE) materials have shown promising energy storage properties that can surpass the currently used PbZrO3-based antiferroelectrics. But while the high energy density of AgNbO3 bulk ceramics is comparable to that of lead-based AFE, its full potential of energy storage performance and working-temperature range has not yet been realized, primarily due to the lack of understanding of phase stability under external perturbation. The effect of mechanical stress on the temperature-dependent AFE phase boundaries. Investigating this relationship is crucial to implement lead-free AFE materials into applications by improving the working temperature range of AgNbO3-based capacitors. Therefore, we propose an in situ mechanical stress and temperature-dependent investigation of AgNbO3 crystal structure to reveal the effect of bias stress on the AFE phase stability and thus allow the use of bias stress to modify the AFE phase stability of other material systems.

In contrast to the more common filamentary switching, manganite devices can switch homogeneously over the whole device and might be superior with respect to their cell-to-cell and cycle-to-cycle variability. However, it is still unclear which are the nanoscale interface mechanisms governing RS. Performing operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will enable us to gain insights into the chemical and structural changes taking place. The main objectives of this proposal are to: 1) experimentally measure the structural and chemical changes related to RS with time-resolved resolution (scale of seconds) by operando electrical measurements; and 2) obtain spatially resolved XAS maps below and between the electrodes with micrometric resolution before, during and after the change in resistance.","3099":"Metal NPs are organised in metal core, surface coating, and protein corona. Optical microscopy suggests that degradation of these elements in cells occurs at different rates, but fluorescence probes can detach or get degraded. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using nanofocused X-ray is ideal to study the localisation of metal NPs with subcellular resolution. Recently, we developed a method to label surface coatings of NPs with brominated tags. This allowed performing XRF and XANES that confirmed differential cellular degradation of cores and coatings of Au NPs after long incubations. Yet, we do not know what happen at short incubations, or with the protein corona formed around those NPs. We want to use XRF maps in cells treated with colloidal NPs at ID16A to probe the relative localisation between Au cores, Br coatings and Gd-labelled proteins. This will provide new insight into the cellular degradation process of colloidal NPs, which is important to assess their potential as biomedical tools.","3101":"Al parts might be subjected to overloads leading to voids, cracks and the replacement of the part. A promising solution is to use self-healing material. A self-healing Al alloy was produced by SLM based on Al-Si and Mg powder. The microstructure is composed of a Si network and Mg2Si precipitates in a \u03b1-Al matrix. During an overload, void nucleation occurs due to fracture of the Si network and of precipitates. The idea is to use a heat treatment to trigger the diffusion of the healing agents to the cavities. The healing potential of fractured Mg2Si was already proven but the SLM microstructure is different and its influence on the healing efficiency and kinetics needs to be investigated. Nanoholotomography allows observing the same area before and after healing in order to track the damage and to assess the healing potential of the material. As the SLM microstructure will not be noticeable, FIB-SEM will be used to evidence the influence of the microstructure on the healing efficiency.","3109":"This proposal will develop, and make available to the user community, a new experimental and algorithmic framework to conduct simulation informed multi-modal in situ experiments on metallic materials.

Achieving this ambitious goal requires (i) a new, fully integrated, in situ load stage compatible with both id11 end stations (ii) an efficient data processing pipeline for DCT, topotomography and scanning-3DXRD acquisitions (both interactive & automated) and (iii) experimentally driven mechanical simulation routines to add stress\/strain fields to the reconstructed data.","3110":"This proposal establishes an industrially relevant methodology for operando characterization of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions under harsh conditions in gas and liquid phases currently unavailable for regular users.

Initially, a spectral database of well-defined Pd and Ru compounds will be collected and used as a training set for machine learning. Then, we will step by step increase the complexity of experimental conditions from currently available cells to a reactor that can withstand up to 250\u00b0C and 50 bar, with the possibility to sample the gas phase and carefully dose liquid reactants.

Recent work by the proposers demonstrates that the aggregates instead experience significant stress variability. Our proposed experiments will exploit combined 3DXRD, scanning 3DXRD and x-ray computed tomography, with digital volume correlation, to quantify stress variability and aggregate-matrix debonding during elastic and inelastic stages of compression in-situ.

On the other hand, remagnetization and recrystallization of magnetic phases can occur from the biosynthesis of degraded elements inside cells. We therefore propose a time-comprehensive study by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of the nanoparticles in the cellular environment at different stages of tissue maturation.

Herein, we propose operando HERFD-XANES\/XES measurements by using a pulse reactor at ID26, which will help us elucidate the evolution of Fe species at a high temporal resolution during methane non-oxidative coupling process. We will perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of Fe speciation by using HERFD-XANES with a focus on the pre-edge features, and identify the specific ligands (C or O) linked to Fe-centers by XES. This information will allow us to directly link the structure and evolution of active sites to their catalytic activity under real reaction conditions and therefore will provide a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst activation and deactivation mechanisms.","3168":"Plastic crystals (PCs) are promising materials with piezo-, ferroelectric, magnetic- and barocaloric properties. Recent discoveries of colossal barocaloric effects suggest they could have important applications in solid-state cooling. Recently we observed colossal barocaloric properties (\u2265100 J kg-1 K-1) under moderate pressures (<1 kbar) in [(CH3)3(CH2Cl)N]FeCl4 and [(CH3)3(CH2Cl)N]GaCl4. The properties of these materials, along with similar PCs, result from combinations of changes in the long-range structural symmetry and local molecular orientation. But the link between structure and properties is not clear. Thus, here we examine the dynamic structural changes occurring as a function of temperature and pressure to accompany calorimetric measurements and determine the precise chemical-structure mechanisms behind the functional properties. This study will provide vital information for developing effective property engineering strategies.","3170":"Magnetic semiconducting thin films with high coercive field and remanence at room temperature are of primary importance for spintronic applications. We plan to realize such films by doping with iron a tetragonal CuO layer grown in epitaxy on SrTiO3(001). A key feature to obtain the desired properties is the Fe substitution of Cu in the CuO tetragonal structure. This configuration should result in a large magnetic superexchange interaction. We will use in situ non-resonant and resonant x-ray diffraction (RXD) to study the films structure. RXD, measured at the Fe K edge, allows to quantify the occupancy rate of the two cations on a same crystallographic site. At the same time GIXRD will allow to exclude the presence of spurious phases.","3178":"This proposal aims at discovering new bi-dimensional materials made of transition metals and boron: MBenes. Although these solid-state phases are expected to exhibit important optoelectronic and catalytic properties, their synthesis could be achieve up to now only at a very small scale and with a large amount of crystal defects, which hinder the study of their properties. To reach some of these materials for the first time, especially a bidimensional iron boride, we want to explore an unreported synthesis pathway: the exfoliation of lamellar compounds MAB (A=metalloid) into inorganic liquids: molten salts. To achieve this goal, we need to understand the reactivity and the transformations of metal borides into molten salts, which are mostly a black box for chemical synthesis. We will shed light on the evolution of these layered materials into molten salts by performing in situ time resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering (PDF analysis).","3185":"In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) during different heat treatments will be applied to study the crystallisation mechanism and microstructural evolution of  Fe-Co soft magnetic alloys manufactured via Selective Laser Melting (SLM). This investigation aspires to elucidate how different heat treatment profiles can induce multiple crystallisation mechanisms that together can affect the final magnetic and mechanical properties of the alloy. This investigation will allow to quantify the relationship among post processing parameters, microstructure, and the associated mechanical\/magnetic properties in SLM engineering components.","3188":"The printing parameters of laser powder bed fusion techniques should be optimised in a way to minimize magnitude of residual stresses. Eigenstrain theory provides an alternative for 3D residual stress mapping by combining experimental data from optical profilometry measurements with numerical models. The proposed experiment aims to interpret 2D plane distribution of residual strains using strain tomography technique at different layers of CM 247 LC specimen. The data from strain tomography measurements will take place of optical profilometry data for the 3D eigenstrain reconstruction of residual stresses. This will provide cross validation between reconstructed residual stresses using two data set. The results of this experiment will allow the use of low cost and accurate eigenstrain reconstruction method, that use optical profilometry data, for 3D residual stress mapping in LPBF printed parts reliably and will help optimisation of printing parameters of LPBF techniques.","3189":"This work focuses on the development of green and energy-efficient sorbents for CO2 optimized for different carbon capture applications. Our preliminary results indicate that Ca-based layered double hydroxides (Ca-LDHs) can be tailored to outperform state-of-the-art sorbents. Here we propose to investigate the adsorption mechanism of CO2 on phase-pure Ca-LDHs of different chemical composition using in situ pair distribution function (PDF) analysis as a function of relative humidity and pCO2. PDF analysis is especially suited to uncover this mechanism due to (1) its potential to unravel short-range order of disordered materials \/ adsorbates; and (2) the occurrence of amorphous intermediates after the conversion of CO2 to CO32-. The specific binding location(s) of CO2 within the Ca-based LDHs will be determined based on the description of the short-range order structure provided by the PDF, aided by additional experimental data and computational simulations.","3197":"Recently we developed an approach to shift the selectivity of cheap Ni-based catalysts, typically used for methanation of CO2, from CH4 to CO by promotion with In. By varying the Ni\/In ratio in a set of Ni-In\/SiO2 catalysts, we found that intermetallic Ni-In nanoparticles display excellent activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction with negligible CH4 formation. X-ray diffraction shows that reduction leads to the formation of Ni-In alloys, which are responsible for the increased activity and selectivity. To link the phase composition and morphology of these alloys to the catalytic performance, a set of operando SAXS\/WAXS experiments is necessary. In these studies we will monitor the alloying caused by varying the reduction conditions and determine the relevance of the formed phases for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. These insights will be instrumental for designing novel highly active and selective catalytic materials for CO2 hydrogenation.","3203":"The focus of this proposal is the study of the structure of superconducting Gd-doped YBCO thin films by EXAFS on the Y K edge and Gd L3 edge with the aim to gather information about the topology of the atoms around the absorber which can give hints about the atomic arrangement of Gd and Y and hence about the nature of the Gd-induced defects.","3208":"Among hydrated borates, inderite and inderborite are two mineralogical species which display a different H2O content (40 wt% in inderborite and 48 wt% in inderite, respectively). In the last years, our team have studied several hydrated borates, each one displaying one (or more) phase transition at high-pressure in the P-range 1.6-14 GPa. The findings suggest a linear correlation between the H2O content and the pressure at which a hydrated borate undergoes a phase transition, but more studies are needed in order to confirm a real trend. \r\nFurthermore, hydrated borates are believed to be a potential aggregate in radiation-shielding concretes due to the large cross section for thermal neutron of the isotope 10B.  A comprehensive characterization of the crystal-chemistry, elastic properties, stability and structural behavior of natural borates at varying T and P conditions is advisable for modelling their behavior as aggregates in radiation-shielding concretes.","3209":"The goal of this proposal is to observe and quantify the 4D strain-induced structural evolutions of biomimetic models of vocal folds (polymeric matrix reinforced by 3D fibrous lattices), once subjected to realistic mechanical vibratory loadings using synchrotron X-ray 4D tomography.\r\nTo do so, there is a need of (i) methodological developments regarding acquisition and reconstruction procedures to image fast-oscillating structures (50 to 400 Hz) at various spatial resolutions (10 \u03bcm to 2 \u03bcm). (ii) multiscale structural and mechanical characterization of realistic vibrating models of human vocal folds that will mimic the mesoscale multi-layered structures made of microscale fibrous architectures.\r\nThis study will provide unprecedented 4D multiscale information to gain an in-depth understanding of the link between the multiscale structures and the micromechanics of vocal-fold tissues with their unique vibratory performances, which is required to develop new biomimetic oscillators.","3212":"In this study, we aim to apply a correlative combination of holographic tomography, x-ray fluorescence computed tomography and 2D-XRF with a  nanoprobe to obtain key insights into durability issues of Fe-based fuel cell catalyst materials. Fe-leaching from the C-encapsulated iron nanoparticles present in the initial catalyst as well as concomitant-poisoning of the catalyst layer's H+-conducting ionomer with leached Fe-ions are both possible mechanisms to which instability issues are ascribed. The unique combination of x-ray techniques above, correlatively applied to a pristine and degraded sample allow us to resolve structural integrity and material distribution (holography) of both catalysts together with elemental distributions mapped on top of the morphology (fluorescence). The results, in combination, will provide insights on both possible degradation mechanisms.","3215":"This proposal aims at analysing the sintering of agglomerated submicronic ceramic powder by in situ nanotomography. High temperature sintering is the main fabrication process of ceramics. It involves complex phenomena that are difficult to observe with conventional techniques. 3D imaging in the course of sintering has proved to be highly valuable for improving the understanding of sintering of metal and glass powders. More recently, during MA-4632 experiment, a micron-size ceramic powder has been 3D imaged throughout sintering at 1500\u00b0C, taking advantage of the resolutions and scan times available at ID16B-NA. In this following project, we will use the same procedure for in situ observation of agglomerated submicron zinc oxide powder compacts that exhibit inter-agglomerate pores. Quantitative analysis of 3D images will allow following the changes of these pores in the course of sintering, which play a key role in the properties of sintered ceramic parts.","3223":"Liquid metal catalysts (LMCats) bear the prospect of continuous 2D materials (2DM) production with unprecedented structural quality, efficiency, and speed. We have previously succeeded in studying the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene on liquid copper at 1370 K (see the previous publications). Meanwhile, growing graphene on liquid catalysts at lower temperatures is of great technical and economic interest. One important candidate is tin, which has a relatively low melting point (505 K) and an exceptionally low vapor pressure. However, tin has very low catalytic activity for graphene growth. Hence, an alloy between tin and a more active metal can provide a compromise between a lower melting point and enough catalytic activity. This proposal aims to grow graphene on a liquid Cu-Sn alloy surface and study the interactions and the atomic structure of the Gr\/Cu-Sn interface using XRR, GIXD, and XRF. This is to be done using the dedicated liquid diffractometer at ID10.","3227":"We have devised two groups of Cu-based electrocatalysts through two approaches: surface modification with Ag single-atoms and co-catalysis between Cu and Nitrogen Doped Carbon (NDC). These catalysts electrochemically convert CO and CO2 to C1-C3 liquid products (e.g., acetate, ethanol, and propanol) at high selectivity. Electrochemical conversion of CO and CO2 to valuable chemicals is of large interest because it provides ways to recycle CO2. Using operando XAFS, combined with computational studies, we can investigate the influence of surface Ag and NDC additives and explain changes in selectivity trends. We aim to employ this state-of-the-art characterization technique to correlate the atomic bonding distance around the catalyst atomic center and coordination environment to the selectivity of our electrocatalysts towards liquid products. A better understanding of these electrochemical processes during the reaction is needed to foster further development.","3229":"FeNC catalysts are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells while their stability need to be improved. Due to their heterogeneous composition, it is difficult to discriminate the contribution of the various iron sites to the activity and degradation. During the ORR, oxygen is either reduced to water or to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is suggested that H2O2 formation is one of the main reasons for the instability. It\u2019s relevance for degradation might decrease, when the catalyst is capable of the further reduction of hydrogen peroxide. In this beam time, we will explore the potential induced changes of iron sites at different conditions to identify which iron sites contribute to which step(s) of the ORR mechanism. Complementary to XAS and XES, the samples will be probed at the same conditions by in situ M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy. Data interpretation is assisted by theoretical calculations. ","3237":"High voltage spinel cathode materials such as LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) are the next step in the evolution of lithium-ion battery technology. Despite relatively large theoretical energy density and fast charging capabilities, the phase transitions of these materials are complex and poorly understood. Operando Scanning X-ray Diffraction microscopy (SXDM) will allow us to follow these phase transitions at the scale of single nanocrystals, and determine the link between cationic ordering, strain, mosaicity, and the dynamics of the phase transitions during battery (dis)charging. The experiment is aimed at studying the spatial distribution of redox processes and lithium deintercalation occurring in single crystal particles. The obtained data on strain transformation would give us valuable information about variations of lithium ionic order and phase evolution at nanoscale and will allow to image heterogeneities in way inaccessible by any other method.","3240":"High ionic mobility in promising solid-state electrolytes of the NaSICON \u2013 type family depend of the temperature dependent distribution of alkaline ions over different crystallographic positions within the 3-dimensionally connected channel structure of the material. Ordering phenomena towards low temperature stepwise reduce the symmetry from the highly conduction, rhombohedral R-3c aristo structure towards monoclinic structures (C2\/c, Cc, P21\/c, P21\/n), yet most of the intermediate states are unsolved and transition phenomena not fully understood. Using a combination of in-situ single \u2013 crystal and powder X-ray diffraction measurements (200 K <= T <= 600 K), the structural phase transition sequences will be studied on 4 representative compositions. From the obtained data we will be able to develop a general model for structural phase traditions in the NaSICON family of compounds having high potential in modern energy related material science.","3252":"Ductile cast irons (DCI) alloyed with silicon and molybdenum (high SiMo-alloys) are commonly used in engine components where materials that can withstand harsh conditions are needed, e.g., in manifolds of the exhaust systems. However, for a detailed understanding of the micromechanical behavior of the materials, an in-situ 3D approach is needed. Here we propose a methodology combining digital volume correlation based on x-ray tomography with line beam and scanning 3DXRD. This combination of techniques will allow us to study intragranular variation of strain and orientation, follow grains even after yield, and obtain information on the shapes and sizes of the grains in the material. This also makes it possible to extract local stress-strain curves from different regions of the sample.\r\nSuch information will be very useful in understanding the micromechanics of the materials, in terms of e.g. yielding behavior, and can also be used to calibrate numerical material models.","3254":"Piezoelectric organic-inorganic hybrid capacitors are widely used and intensively studied in order to improve their piezoelectric properties. Anyhow, the internal structure of such devices is not well known at the microscale. Micron X-ray beam allows probing the internal structure by scanning the vertical device direction in order to obtain X-ray diffraction (XRD) in transmission geometry. The aim is to gain information on the structure of the organic matrix, the inorganic particles, and the matrix-electrode interfaces as a function of vertical position and electrical poling at different temperatures for various inorganic particle concentrations and particle surfactants.","3265":"With the use of nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres supporting the Pt nanoparticles(Pt\/HCS), we have produced a catalyst with high electrochemical surface area and high mass activity. Initial characterisation and testing have shown the catalyst is able to resist support corrosion and reduces Pt agglomeration. After 6000 potential cycles mimicking a PEMFC cathode compartment, the catalyst retained higher electrochemical surface area compared to the commercial Johnson Matthey 40 wt% Pt catalyst. Small Pt particles were formed with deposition on the outside of the shell and inside the pores of the shell. The new catalysts demonstrate high activity (>380 \u03bcA cm\u22122 and 240 mA g\u22121) surpassing the commercial Pt\/C by more than 10%. The catalysts demonstrate excellent durability compared to a commercial Pt\/C in load cycling, experiencing less than 50% changes in the mass-specific activity (MA) and surface area-specific activity (SA). ","3269":"NiMnGa alloys are FeSMA where the thermoelastic martensitic transformation (TMT) is correlated to the ferromagnetic transition and the Curie Temperature (Tc). Materials  where the Tc is overlapped to the TMT temperature have attracted interest for multifunctional properties as magnetocaloric and magnetomechanical coupling. Due to the high brittleness of these systems, attention has been devoted to sintering routes. The tuning of the grain and microstructure gives a modulation of TMT temperatures, and  the shift of its temperatures to overlap with Tc. The correlation of magnetic and martensitic transition could be influenced by local order of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state. The stored energy due to the sintering process could induce structural distortion that influence the magnetic order. An investigation of microstructure and a description of its cell parameter is interesting in NiMnGa samples, where the Tc and the TMT temperatures are far or near to be overlapped.","3273":"TbPc2 molecules are single molecular magnets (SMM) considered as of possible Qubis realizations in future quantum computing technology and for spinterfaces, spin filtering systems in semiconductors. Metallic substrates are well studied for these molecules but destroy most of the SMM properties. Insulating substrates like MgO are better suited for this purpose revealing coercive fields up to 2 T. Here we will investigate a ferromagnetic semiconducting surface, EuO. This surface is relatively stable in UHV conditions and will be prepared on-site. The magnetic properties of TbPc2 will be investigated on top of this surface. ","3274":"We propose to perform high-resolution fluorescence-detected XANES (HERFD-XANES) at the Pb and Bi L3 edges to clarify how Bi3+ heterovalent doping changes the electronic structure and electron transport properties of a one-dimensional hybrid halide pseudo-perovskite, (TMSO)PbI3 (TMSO = (CH3)3SO+), either undoped, lightly or heavily doped. In this way, we will get helpful information about the doping-electron properties relationship and, ultimately, about the fundamental understanding of hybrid perovskites in thermoelectric or optoelectronic devices.","3277":"We aim to elucidate the role of Bi3+ as dopant in APbI3 hybrid halide pseudo-perovskites (A = CH3NH3+ (MA) or (CH3)3SO+ (TMSO)). These compounds present different connectivity of [PbI6] octahedra and, accordingly, a different structural dimensionality. This difference affects the electronic levels of the pristine compounds and, consequently, of the doped samples. Heterovalent doping on these perovskites significantly decreases the bandgap and is massively beneficial for electric conductivity. Through XAFS measurements at Pb- and Bi- edges on samples with different Bi doping, we expect to elucidate the role of the local structure in changing the electronic structure and band gap of model compounds for thermoelectrics and photovoltaics.","3278":"The study aims at understanding mechanistic details of three-way catalysts (TWC) by exploring the struc-ture of Pd species in Pd\/Al2O3 and Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts during systematic variation of reaction atmos-phere, from simplified to realistic gas mixtures. The operando investigations of Pd K edge will be com-plementary to those conducted in our previous HERFD-XANES experiments at ID26 on Pd L3 edge (pro-posal MA-4916), and will contribute to a holistic comprehension of TWC functionality. In short, we will focus on: (1) identification of inhibition\/boosting phenomena by operando monitoring the evolution in Pd oxidation state during interaction with CO, C3H6 and NO and their combinations, and (2) revealing the impact of catalyst support and reaction mixture on noble metal sintering and redispersion.","3281":"We are going to perform and monitor a reaction between nitrogen and multicomponent refractory alloys (high-entropy and ternary alloys) under compression and heating in a DAC to observe a formation of high-entropy nitrides based on platinum group metals.

Our study will give insight into reactions of multicomponent platinum-based alloys with nitrogen to obtain ultra-incompressible multicomponent nitrides recoverable at ambient conditions.","3300":"Bismuth (Bi)-based catalysts have the potential to produce formic acid  through electrochemical CO2 conversion. The inevitable reconstruction of catalysts under working conditions is unfortunately not well understood, resulting in inaccurate understanding of structure-property relationships. Here, we fabricated two-dimensional Bi oxyhalides electrocatalysts, i.e.BiOBr (BOB)  and BiOCl (BOC). A selectivity (97%) of CO2 to formic acid was obtained with current density up to 156 mA\/cm2 on BOB, whereas BOC displayed a lower selectivity (80%) with current density of 116 mA\/cm2.  In order to elucidate the real active sites, we propose to perform in situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy at the Bi L3 edge. Together with the in situ X-ray diffraction study we have conducted, a link will be built between the different catalytic behavior and the nature of catalytically active sites in the studied catalysts, which would pave the way for the rational design of next-generation electrocatalysts.

A coupling with X-ray tomography would allow the investigation of dealloying rates and resulting morphology.","3317":"Ionic diffusion in a solid is affected by both local and long-range crystal order. Understanding the relationship between ionic diffusion and crystal structure in different length scales will help to design new and better high-performance solid electrolytes for solid-state battery. We want to perform a detailed local structure analysis of newly discovered Na3-xY1-xZrxCl6 (NYZCx) based Na ionic conductor. Various parameters of NYZCx at local length scale, including transition metal ordering, mixing, and intrinsic vacancy effect on Na ion dynamics. For example, NYZCx synthesized at different processes shows a drastic change in conductivities like other Na-based superionic conductors such as Na3PS4, and NaZrCl6. We believe that a detailed understanding of the local structure of this NYZCx synthesized at different routes explains more insights about Na ion dynamics and help to create the design principle of high superionic conductor for solid-state battery applications. \r\n","3322":"The methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction is a key process in the C1 chemistry. MTO is heterogeneously catalysed by crystalline solid materials like zeolites. Many aspects of this reaction have been investigated also employing advanced synchrotron techniques such as in situ\/operando powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The main focus of these studies was mainly on catalyst deactivation and formation of coke precursors within the pores (unit cell expansion). Our aim is to study the MTO process applying time resolved high energy PXRD in order to assess the dynamic behavior of selected zeolite frameworks in dedicated transient experiments. We will i) look at the time-resolved changes in lattice parameters during and after short controlled pulses of methanol to study the dynamics of the framework in the active period of the catalyst; ii) we will correlate this behavior with the timing of release of the products, possibly indicating the direct dynamic involvement of the framework in the reaction","3331":"In this proposal, we will use high energy\/flux complementary synchrotron radiation techniques at beamline ID31 to systematically investigate how catalyst type and corresponding NP size affects cathode catalyst layer stability and CO2 electrolysis performance under reported accelerated stress tests (ASTs). Simultaneously, building upon our previous work at ESRF, we will track water and ionic distributions throughout the MEA at different stages during the ASTs to differentiate catalyst decay mechanisms from changes in mass transport-related decay, which may arise from physical gas diffusion electrode (GDE) degradation leading to changes in properties such as porosity and hydrophobicity. Overall, in this proposal we seek to understand state-of-the-art CO2 electrolysis device degradation mechanisms through AST protocols by probing the operando chemical and morphological changes to the catalyst layer and its local hydration environment during operation.","3338":"Metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au, are widely employed for biomedical applications in the fields of diagnosis or drug\/gene among others. They exhibit a variety of properties, being the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) one of the most recognized. The LSPR band depends on several properties of the NPs and surrounding media, which alter the physical properties and thus the final response in their specific application. The aim of this proposal is to study, by XANES and EXAFS techniques at the Au L3-edge, the electronic and structural modifications induced in different Au NPs by changing their size, shape and aggregation state to correlate with the plasmonic and photothermal response. 3D aggregates of different dimensions will be analyzed determining the structural variations and the disorder effects generated in the nanostructures by the biological media. Cluster formation of NPs depends on the size and shape of NPs and it is a key parameter in the biomedical applications.","3340":"Here, we aim to improve the black phase stability of CsPbI3 at ambient conditions without compromising the optoelectronic properties by controlled doping-induced lattice strain. Incorporation of the dopant can occur via two pathways: by substitution with the B-site metal or by occupation of interstitial sites\/grain boundary in the lattice. Depending on the incorporation type, the cationic\/anionic charge state and occupancy would be modified to neutralize the overall system, leading to distinct changes in the lattice and band structures creating measurable structural and optical signatures. For the doping case it is important to know where the dopant is sitting and how it is helping to reduce the spontaneous strain, which call for systematic local atomic structure and electronic state characterization of Cs and I atom in series of Bi3+ doped CsPbI3 to investigate the underlying operation and phase degradation mechanisms. Therefore, high resolution XAFS is mandatory for all the systems.","3351":"A major issue during turbine blade production for aeronautic applications is the formation of defects such as stray grains, freckles, and segregated areas.These defects are linked to the development of strain and convective flows during the solidification step.

The experiment will consist in visualizing the solidification of samples of a commercial Ni-base alloy and a model binary alloy for comparison with numerical simulations. To achieve this goal, directional solidification experiments will be monitored with a unique high-temperature furnace allowing time-resolved synchrotron radiography and diffraction imaging to be concomitantly used.","3352":"By using the advanced capability at ESRF, we aim to capture and quantify the subsurface failure mechanisms when CFRPs are subjected to impact loading at temperatures relevant to aviation service (-60\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C). The ultimate goals are to delineate and characterise the role of delamination, fibre debonding, fibre breakage, matrix crack, and matrix\/fibre interaction in a time-resolved manner as they occur during dynamic mechanical loading. Briefly, the thermomechanical behaviour of CFRP specimens will be characterised using an SHPB under a controlled thermal environment. High-speed X-ray phase contrast imaging will be used to obtain subsurface radiographic sequences of damage features, while X-ray digital image correlation will enable us to quantify subsurface deformation fields. The results of this research will provide unique data to validate advanced damage models for this important class of materials and will help guide future material design in the aerospace industry.","3356":"Al parts might be subjected to overloads leading to voids, cracks and the replacement of the part. A promising solution is thus to use self-healing material. A self-healing Al alloy was produced by LPBF using liquid-asssisted healing strategy. The microstructure is composed of high melting point Al cells surrounded by a lower melting point eutectic network. During an overload, void nucleation occurs due to fracture of the eutectic network. The idea is to apply a heat treatment to trigger the melting of the low melting point eutectic phase which can thus flow and fill the voids due to damage. The healing potential of these LPBF Al-Mg alloys was already proven but the mechanical properties of the developed healable Al-Mg alloy are rather low compared to other high strength Al alloys. Alloying elements were thus introduced in the material and their effect on the healing efficiency should be analysed. ","3360":"Pellistors have been used commercially for decades. They consist of a miniature Pt coil encased in a porous catalytic bead of Rh-doped ceramic (ca. 800 \u00b5m diameter). Since the target gases must diffuse and combust at active Rh sites inside the pores of the ceramic bead, the internal pore structure of the pellistor is integrally linked to sensor performance. Its 3D structure is not adequately studied. For this study, sub-100 nm resolution with a field of view (FOV) over hundred microns is required. So far this is unfeasible. We will make it feasible with the very recently developed technique multi-beam ptychographic tomography and achieve the required resolution over large FOV (\u2265 100 \u03bcm) to investigate the pore structure of the intact Rh\/Al2O3 pellistor at 21 keV.","3367":"In this proposal we are planning to study van der Waals heterostructures consisting of combinations of different 2D polymers and graphene. Initial results of structures comprised of 2D polyimide and graphene have shown very interesting optoelectronic properties including a fast interlayer charge transfer.

This calls for novel ways to engineer strain and regulate phase, and suitable methods to characterization the phase transition dynamics. CsPbI3 perovskite is promising for optical applications; however, it is unstable under ambient conditions, forming a yellow non-perovskite phase, hindering adoption. This project aims to use Br-doped CsPbI3 crystals as a materials platform to examine radiation-induced disorder and phase stabilization: Stage I will induce local structural disorder via resonant X-ray absorption at Br sites, and Stage II will examine the microstructure and thermal-phase properties. This is motivated by preliminary data of synchrotron radiation-induced stabilization of CsPbI3 perovskite, opening a new paradigm for stabilization. However, this is only empirically understood, and experiments at SNBL-BM01 will help develop models to rationalize\/exploit these observations.","3407":"Among thermoelectric materials, Cu2-\u03b4S alloys display unique advantages of nontoxicity, a rather low cost, and environmental friendliness, and thus have aroused extensive research interest. Monoclinic \u03b3-chalcocite, Cu2S, presents a rigid Cu-sublattice, while the \u03b2-hexagonal and \u03b1-cubic higher temperature phases have shown liquid-like ionic conductivity with excellent thermoelectric properties. Besides, the tetragonal \u03b4-phase is formed under high pressure and has been proposed as a more stable structure for applications, but its investigation is still limited. The goal of this proposal is twofold: i) to characterize the structural features of the tetragonal phase at RT for a Cu2-xMnxS series prepared under high pressure; ii) to analyze the evolution across the phase transitions at low and intermediate temperatures (in the 200 - 750 K interval) of the tetragonal \u03b4-phase Cu2S and of the Mn-doped derivatives, to use investigate the electronic density and the ionic disorder.

The cubic perovskite BaTiO3 comprises one of the most renowned ferroelectrics, where co-operative displacements of the Ti4+ cations along the <111> lattice direction produce the macroscopic polarisation. BaTiO3 can also exist in a hexagonal polymorph (h-BaTiO3), which \u2013 despite also being ferroelectric \u2013 has attracted surprisingly little attention. Moreover, the mechanism of ferroelectricity in this material has remained contentious owing to its insufficient structural characterisation. We seek to resolve the controversy regarding its ferroelectric ground state by performing a variable-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction (S-XRD) study. This will inform how ferroelectric properties can be engineered into similar structural architectures, informing the design of multifunctional ceramic materials for future electronic devices.","3413":"Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) powered by renewable electricity can convert detrimental CO2 emissions into sustainable fuels and chemicals. By using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and by reacting CO2 from the gas phase, high eCO2R current density can be achieved. GDEs, however, degrade fast during eCO2R due to flooding by the electrolyte, thus operating for < 100 h. Flooding can be curbed in polymer GDEs using hydrophobic substrates, but it can still be induced by precipitation of hygroscopic carbonate crystals in the GDE due to CO2 dissolution. In our previous work, polymer GDEs of small pore size were 50x more stable than their large pore size counterpart (< 1 h to > 50 h). We thus propose to use operando XRD in Beamline ID31 to study carbonate precipitation during eCO2R, its kinetics and its dependence on GDE pore size. As GDE degradation is the most severe issue facing eCO2R, these results will provide fundamental understanding as well as important technological guidelines.","3441":"Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have shown superior performance in various electro-optic applications, such as  light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic cells, which depend on the interconversion of photons and mobile charge carriers. The charge carrier becomes thus dressed by a local lattice deformation, forming a polaron quasiparticle. Because of the weak-to-intermediate electron-phonon interaction in LHPs, large polarons develop, with the lattice distortion spanning over multiple lattice constants, i.e., a few nanometres. Our target is to identify the crystallographic phase, coordination chemistry, local octahedral tilting, disorder, etc. on illuminated CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with synthetically tuned morphologies of cubes, hexagon and polygons. For the development of the relation between particle shape and corresponding polaron, we have to performed temperature dependent wide angle x-ray scattering with and without applying femtosecond pulsed laser.","3502":"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a versatile class of highly porous crystalline materials, are firmly established as promising performers for applications in catalysis, separations, sensing and more. One of the major challenges in the MOF field is development of scalable, reliable and green synthetic methods to produce high quality MOF materials. Recently reported green ambient temperature syntheses of MOFs in water from metal and ligand salts stand out in their simplicity, rapid nature and industrial attractiveness. However, these methods work only for some MOFs, questioning their broad applicability. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the underlying mechanisms of formation of MOF-74 family materials in aqueous phase in order to shed light on systems\u2019 speciation and processes of nucleation and growth, with larger goals of understanding fundamentals of MOF growth in such systems and developing reliable rapid and green synthetic procedures for numerous MOF families.","3531":"Sodium-ion batteries are attracting much attention for electrochemical energy-storage applications due to the higher abundance and lower cost of sodium\r\ncompared with lithium. Layered transition-metal oxides, in particular NaNiO2 (NNO), hold promise as high-capacity cathode active materials. However, they\r\ntypically suffer from capacity degradation during battery operation. To address this issue, NaNi0.9Ti0.1O2 (NNTO) has been successfully synthesized and found to exhibit significantly improved cycling performance and stability over NNO. This is due in part to benefits of having two active redox couples, namely Ni2+\/Ni3+ and Ni3+\/Ni4+, in NNTO. To correlate the redox chemistry with the electrochemical behavior and to gain insights into the electronic and local structural environments of nickel and titanium, we plan to perform in-situ XAS measurements at the Ni and Ti K-edges.","3590":"On the underlying mechanisms of chemical binding and accumulation in heart and brain tissue of Gadolinium of Gadolinium-based contrast agent","3595":"Multiscale Quantification of Covid-19\u2019s impact on lung vasculature from whole lobe to alveolar\/microvascular scales","3596":"The aim of this project is to design and prototype hyaluronic acid sodium salt (HA)-dexamethasone nanoparticles for a synergic treatment of patients on ventilators in intensive care units, as in serious cases of COVID-19. The final goal is the development of a new promising ha-dexamethasone liquid formulation to be delivered as an aerosol during artificial ventilation. Aim of the proposal is to characterize by SAXS the structure of nanoparticles as a function of composition, HA molecular weight and polymer\/drug ratio. Moreover, we want to study the interaction of the different formulations with mucus models: stability or structural modifications of the nanoparticles, propensity to penetrate the mucus barrier, mucoadhesion. Results will give information on the structural evolution of the nanoparticles, helping in the selection of the most promising formulations.","3597":"The aim of this proposal is to study the ability of radioluminescent nanoparticles (nanoscintillators) to potentiate synchrotron radiotherapy by inducing deep-tissue photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiation dose-enhancement effect (RDE). While the RDE effect results from an excess of energy deposited by photo- and Auger electrons that are created when X-rays interact with heavy-elements, PDT relies on photosensitizers (PS) that generate cytotoxic species upon light activation. As light penetrates weakly in tissues, PDT is usually limited to superficial tumors. To reach deep tumors, nanoscintillators can be used to locally convert X-rays into visible light and remotely induce PDT. In this project, we will investigate the ability of a nanoscintillator (Lu3Al5O12:Pr) conjugated to a clinically used PS (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) to induce a PDT and RDE effect in vitro in 2D and 3D cultures of pancreatic tumors.","3599":"PhotoBioModulation (PBM) is a novel treatment that exploits laser light at 600-1000 nm to produce analgesia in many clinical conditions. Although PMB use is established, the mechanism of action oi still poorly understood.  Evidences indicate that PBM in sensory neurons modulates calcium influx induced by a noxious stimulus. To complement results obtained with conventional studies, the present proposal aims at using XRF microscopy for studying calcium distribution in sensory neurons, before and after laser light stimulation. The analyses will help to improve the understanding and thus the clinical use of PMB for pain","3603":"Humans and other large organisms are three-dimensional multiscale biological systems where large scale function and structure are dependent on the macrostructure\u2019s interconnectivity down to the cellular and subcellular level. Using the exceptional coherence provided by the ESRF-EBS, we have demonstrated that propagation-based phase-contrast can effectively decouple resolution from specimen size in soft tissue, obtaining 1.4 micron voxel resolution in 150 mm diameter human organs. Through this Long Term Proposal (LTP) we will develop the techniques required to image whole human and animal bodies ex vivo at 25 micron resolution, zooming to sub-micron voxels (0.7micron) locally, resolving sub-cellular structures through hard- and soft-tissue. Resolving how the micro (sub-cellular) interacts with the macro (whole organism) across length scales will provide all new insights into biological and biomedical function. This is true for both healthy and pathological system level behaviour.","3616":"This proposal aims at studying the ability of nanoscintillators to potentiate synchrotron radiotherapy by inducing deep-tissue photodynamic therapy (PDT) and\r\n radiation dose-enhancement (RDE).

The aim of the proposal is the structural characterization by USAXS\/SAXS of biomechano-responsive 3D polymeric scaffolds, both porous and fibrous. The evolution of the scaffolds under mechanical stress and their resilience will be observed to assess the nanoscale response to a mechanical solicitation. Results will help in the multiple-length-scale mechanic analysis of thermoplastic-based scaffolds, able to improve surgical repair or reconstruction of tendons\/ligaments.","3664":"In-situ Mapping of Twinning in Graphite by Diffraction Contrast Tomography","3665":"Evolution of pore morphology during shrinkage under hot isostatic pressing and growth by interdiffusion via Kirkendall mechanism in Ni-base ","3671":"Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is the most common additive manufacturing technology. It involves complex laser-matter interactions that occur in microseconds which is difficult to characterise. Existing work uses X-ray imaging to study a laser melting of a single powder layer and is far from the true LPBF process. Here, we request a long-term proposal to co-develop a state-of-the-art facility with ID19 to image the LPBF process: (1) we will deliver an in situ AM rig (that can perform multi-hatch\/layer) to the ESRF; co-develop (2) ultra-fast correlative imaging techniques to monitor fast dynamics during LPBF; (3) employ multi-beam technologies to reduce defects; exploit the big data acquired to (4) develop machine-learned algorithms for image segmentation, and (5) advance multiphysics process simulation to predict the process and support experimental design. This work will advance our understanding of LPBF and underpin the expected growth of the global AM market (~$100bn in 10 years).","3672":"Fast-charging Li-ion cells that are sufficiently power dense while also durable and safe will increase the competitiveness of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). To achieve this, the local state-of-charge (SoC_ and temperature must be sufficiently controlled. However, in practice this is highly challenging and informed design from experimental feedback is not possible as invasive methods are required to obtain such information. In these experiments we will employ ultra-fast powder X-ray diffraction computed tomography to monitor the crystallography of the current collectors and electrodes within operating lithium-ion batteries to map the temperature and SoC in real-time. These experiments would be the first of the report of dual-temperature and SoC mapping during operation and the findings will have immediate tangible impacts upon our fundamental understandings of battery operation for researchers, as well as providing much needed insight for cell designers within the commercial sphere.

With the recent EBS upgrade enabling an expansive test matrix, synchrotron radiation computed tomography will be used to visualize and analyze in situ damage nucleation and progression to support the establishment of fundamental relationships between diverse, unexplored damage precursors (i.e., morphological features that nucleate or alter damage progression) and the complex failure mechanisms exhibited in aerospace-grade carbon microfiber reinforced plastics. The generated data will also support the development of seminal artificial intelligence-driven automated morphology and damage segmentation tools and, consequently, accelerate all future studies of 4D damage in heterogeneous materials.","3678":"Exploiting X-ray phase contrast imaging, this proposal aims to extend our physical description of the cavitation bubble cloud dynamics in a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) field to the internal cloud dynamics. The expected comprehensive description will contribute to improve the use of HIFU in multiple medical applications. More specifically, we intend to conduct HIFU-cavitation bubble cloud experiments in (1) a boundary-free environment to describe the canonical dynamics of bubble clouds and (2) in a human body environment (using phantoms) to address the effect of boundaries on the cloud dynamics mimicking conditions in HIFU-based clinical therapies.","3681":"Crystallization of lipids is important for the functionality and sensory properties of fat-containing food products. Such products are often dispersions, in which particles are stabilized by a dispersing agent. In this project, the effect of particle hydrophobicity and the dispersing agent on fat crystallization will be investigated at different length scales. WAXS and SAXS have traditionally been used to study the nano-scale polymorphism during fat crystallization. The polymorphs further arrange into crystal nanoplatelets (CNPs), which are the building blocks of the fat crystal network. SAXS analysis enables to quantify the average CNP thickness and the thickness distribution. More recently, on the meso-scale, USAXS is used to estimate size, shape and aggregation of CNPs. The presence of non-lipid ingredients in dispersions induces additional interactions and alterations in the fat crystallization process, resulting in an increased complexity. ","3690":"We have developed a novel gas-solid reactor design using non-stoichiometric oxides as oxygen-carrier materials (OCMs). The OCM develops a gradient\r\nin oxygen potential along the length of the chemical reactor. These varying oxidation potentials have many advantages, such as overcoming the chemical\r\nequilibrium constraints encountered in conventional reactors. We have demonstrated the principle of operation using the water-gas shift reaction and published high-impact publications in Nature Chemistry with ESRF co-authors and in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., ACS Appl. Energy Mater. and ACS Nano. We now seek to extend this work to direct, one-step methane-to-hydrogen production. This could be a breakthrough technology for a future low-carbon fuel economy. This work will involve two strands, (i) controlling the oxygen capacity and chemical potential via doping strategies and materials selection, (ii) producing OCMs with novel properties by harnessing exsolution processes.","3695":"Technological functionality and sensory properties fat-containing food products often depends on the crystallization of the lipids present. Such food products are often suspensions, meaning they contain a dispersed particle phase in a continuous fat matrix. Most often, the dispersed phase is stabilized by a dispersing agent. Both dispersed phase and dispersing agent can influence fat crystallization. In this proposal, the effect of shear on fat crystallization in model suspensions will be investigated. The effect of different shear rates is expected to take place at different length scales (nano- to meso-scale) and thus to be visual both in SAXS and USAXS. Model systems comprising fat, food-grade particles and a dispersing agent will be studied. SAXS will allow to study the fat\u2019s chain length arrangement and crystal nanoplatelet thickness (CNP), while USAXS provides an estimate of the CNP size and the aggregation thereof.","3722":"","3726":"Fourier Transform Holography (FTH) is an established microscopy technique with nanoscale resolution providing images of one projection of the magnetic moments in a thin sample. We propose to extend the scope of the technique by realizing a full vectorial determination of the magnetic moments in two test samples: one with Landau domains around a vortex core, and one with a skyrmion lattice. This improvement is highly desirable for the study of materials with complex magnetic textures such as skyrmions, chiral domain walls, Bloch points, etc...","3728":"We propose to establish a new community-driven mode of access dedicated to the study of materials under rapid and extreme loading. This mode will utilise the block allocation group (BAG) model, pooling together shared equipment, personnel and expertise to underpin and enhance the science at the intersection of X-rays and dynamically-compressed matter. This Shock-BAG would build-upon the dedicated gas-gun, Hopkinson bar platforms, and multi-MHz X-ray imaging scheme arising from our recent LTP, offering these proven tools and expertise to grow the high-rate and shock user community at ESRF. In addition, the Shock-BAG would serve as a home for emergent techniques, such as pulsed power-, laser- and explosive-drive, which share similar challenges and diagnostic needs. The combination of these research tools will enable us to probe the properties of matter at extreme conditions, from damage in composites panels, to the physics of earthquakes.","3736":"Ghost imaging works by preparing two copies of a patterned illumination beam. One copy is sent through the specimen and only the total intensity transmitted is recorded, by a point (or bucket) detector. The second copy is measured directly by an array detector (without passing through the sample). The first experimental x-ray ghost imaging was achieved at ID19@ESRF and reported by our team, in a landmark paper in 2016. In subsequent experiments at ID19 we produced 2D, 3D and then phase-contrast x-ray ghost imaging. This proposal takes the topic in a completely new direction: ghost projection.  Rather than recording bucket-signal correlations to image an object, we establish such correlations to create a desired image. We create an arbitrary spatial distribution of intensity by illuminating a single spatially-random screen and transversely scanning it. This proposal aims at realising a 2D ghost projection proof of concept, can be considered as a spatial light modulator for x rays.   ","3737":"Time-resolved X-ray tomography at light sources has experienced rapid development in the last 10 years, evolving from static or quasi-static 3D acquisitions to 3D movies at 200 Hz, as recently demonstrated. The rapid evolution of such techniques results from the improvement of sources, detectors, and reconstruction algorithms. However, the acquisition or rotation process has not been changed and has become a bottleneck to explore faster dynamics. For example, rotations induce shear forces that may alter the studied dynamics and difficult for the sample environment to probe such dynamics. We recently have demonstrated at\r\nESRF X-ray multi-projection imaging (XMPI) that avoids rotating the sample by illuminating it with several X-ray beams. Thus, we will demonstrate imaging of previously inaccessible dynamic processes evolving at timescales that cannot be accessed with currently existing techniques.","3738":"The POLAR-2 instrument is a space-based X-\/gamma-ray polarimeter which will be launched in Spring 2025. The instrument is being developed by a Swiss, Polish, German and Chinese collaboration. It will perform polarization measurements of photons coming from a range of astrophysical sources. To perform such measurements it is of crucial importance to study the performance of the instrument prior to launch using a dedicated polarized beam. For this, X-rays at different energies from a well-controlled beam are required. The ESRF facility therefore forms the ideal location to verify the POLAR-2 detector concept. Measurements will be performed on the final prototype of POLAR-2 for a range of different energies and instrument configurations in order to gain a full understanding of the detector performance. The results of this study will form the basis of one scientific publication, whereas further lessons learned from this study can still be implemented in the final detector design.","3741":"This proposal concerns renewal of the Shock block allocation group (BAG). As a reminder, the purpose of the Shock BAG is to coordinate and promote access to high-resolution X-ray imaging to further study of materials under rapid and extreme loading. The BAG pools together shared equipment, personnel and expertise to underpin and enhance the science at the intersection of X-rays and dynamically-compressed matter. Thus far, the BAG has successfully operated 2 out of 5 intended run periods, focusing on the already established gas-gun, and Hopkinson bar platforms. These first campaigns enabled the research of 12 independent teams, thereby sharing the overhead in setting-up and tearing-down, and helping ensure good quality data was obtained. This renewal seeks to extend the Shock BAG to enable support of emergent techniques identified in the original proposal, such as pulsed power-, laser- and explosive-drive, which share similar challenges and diagnostic needs.","3762":"Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology University of Leeds Block Allocation Group","3767":"Structural studies of various proteins in Uppsala and Stockholm","3768":"PROTEINS RELATED TO PATHOGENESIS OF DISEASES, VIRAL PROTEINS, CELL DIVISION, SIGNALLING AND CHROMATIN PROCESSES","3770":"Structural Biology of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes from India","3775":"Southampton, UCL Royal Free, Exeter, Portsmouth Block Allocation Group (BAG)","3776":"Fundamental and Applied Aspects of Radiation Damage","3777":"Finnish National Protein Crystallography Consortium (FinnProCC)","3778":"Macromolecular Crystallography BAG - Portugal","3780":"Cambridge MRC Block allocation","3782":"Macromolecular Crystallography at South-East Andalusia","3783":"Austrian Crystallographic Diffraction Consortium (AC-DC)","3784":"BAG Paris Rive-Gauche","3785":"BAG BARCELONA","3789":"BAG STRASBOURG NANCY PALAISEAU","3792":"Stockholm BAG","3793":"Understanding the 3D structure of a variety of proteins related to the human health","3794":"BAG for the Structural Biology Groups in Madrid","3799":"Macromolecular Crystallography in Lyon\/Toulouse\/Bordeaux\r\nIBCP-MMSB \/ IPBS \/ IECB IBGC CBMN","3801":"Danish Biochemistry and Structural Biology BAG","3806":"Structural Biology in Marseille","3807":"PSB SAS platform BAG: joint applications of solution small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering\r\n(continuation)","3808":"Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology University of Leeds Block Allocation Group","3810":"Macromolecular crystallography at the Philipps University Marburg (MarBAG)","3812":"IBS BAG","3813":"Holland-Belgium BAG","3814":"Structural investigation of membrane and water soluble proteins","3815":"Structural studies of various proteins in Uppsala and Stockholm","3818":"PROTEINS RELATED TO PATHOGENESIS OF DISEASES, VIRAL PROTEINS, CELL DIVISION, SIGNALLING AND CHROMATIN PROCESSES","3829":"Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of recombinant Hantaan virus nucleocapsids","3831":"DNA conformation within the complexes DNA-DPS grown in vitro","3835":"Macromolecular Crystallography at South-East Andalusia","3837":"Paris Rive-Gauche BAG","3838":"BAG BARCELONA","3839":"Structural Biology at EMBL Grenoble and IBS-CIBB","3840":"Berlin-Karlsruhe - Macromolecular Crystallography BAG - Structural Biology of light responsive, signal transducing and metalloproteins","3841":"FRANKFURT\/SAARLAND BAG: ATOMIC MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF MEMBRANE PROTEINS","3846":"Understanding the 3D structure of a variety of proteins related to the human health","3847":"BAG for the Structural Biology Groups in Madrid","3848":"Structural Biology of Macromolecules and Macromolecular complexes from India","3849":"Structural biology of multiprotein systems in signalling and metabolism","3850":"Russian BAG for Xtallography and BioSAXS","3851":"Proteins and protein\/DNA\/RNA complexes involved in biosynthesis, protein folding and\r\ndegradation, splicing, cancer, host pathogen interacti","3853":"Fundamental and Applied Aspects of Radiation Damage","3854":"Finnish National Protein Crystallography Consortium (FinnProCC)","3855":"Structural Biology BAG - Portugal","3858":"Munich Crystallography BAG","3859":"Structural remodelling of photosynthetic membrane complexes","3869":"Cryo-EM structure of a mammalian membrane adenylyl cyclase","3870":"Toxoplasma ATPsynthase","3880":"Cryo-EM structure of reaction centre light harvesting 1 core complex from purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides","3889":"Investigating structural changes in allosteric activation and inhibition of tyrosine kinases","3898":"3D reconstruction of the ACAD9:ECSIT complex at high resolution","3906":"High-resolution cryo-EM structure of distinct forms of human \u03b12-macroglobulin","3912":"High-resolution structure of the homotetramer tyrosin hydroxylase (TH)","3930":"IBS BAG","3948":"Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of La Crosse virus full length polymerase","3962":"","3965":"","3966":"","3967":"","3968":"","3969":"","3970":"Molecular determinants of arginine decarboxylase polymerisation during bacterial acid stress response","3972":"The BAG of Montpellier gathers researchers from distinct institutes (CBS, IGF, IRIM and LPHI) affiliated to the INSERM, the CNRS and the university of Montpellier. \r\nThe CBS is a node of the national infrastructure FRISBI.

We analyse the structures of different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; e.g. melanocortin-4 receptor and rhodopsin), either alone or in complex with their cognate G-proteins, to understand their signalling mechanisms. In our work on the biocatalytic splitting of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons, we analyse the membrane-bound and soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases, proteins of the remarkably small subgroup of hydrogenases that are active under aerobic conditions.

Interestingly, despite their beautiful coloration these photonic structures are far from perfect, and often contain a \u201ccertain amount\u201d of structural disorder. While this is optimized in nature, man-made approaches to producing similarly brilliant colors are still in their infancy. Currently, the big stumbling block is the lack of a measure of the degree of order in the biological \u201cblueprint\u201d. We propose the use of ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) for a statistically meaningful quantification of the degree of order in 3D photonic structures found in weevil scales that contain various degrees of disorder, nicely demonstrating nature\u2019s common approach towards producing distinct coloration. We therefore expect the USAXS experiments proposed here to shed light on the fundamental coloration mechanisms in weevils and similar biophotonic structures.","4343":"We propose to study the dynamics of synaptic vesicles (SV) [1] and of artificial lipid vesicles in dense vesicle pools by XPCS.

Center-of-mass movements as well as relaxation of deformations and viscoelastic strain fields in the pool are expected to contribute to the XPCS signal, and will be disentangled via the q-dependence and by varying the sample setup (density, SV versus simple vesicles, protein concentration etc.). Here we extend our previous SAXS study of SV pools (SC-5112) by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) using highly brilliant ESRF undulator radiation.

Since cocoa trees only grow in some tropical areas, this increased demand have pushed farmers to convert regions of intact forests into cocoa plantations. Between 2001 and 2014 Ghana lost 175,000 hectares of forest due to cocoa expansion. Such amount of deforestation can have a serious impact on biodiversity and climate change. For this reason, food manufacturers have started to develop strategies to replace or reduce the amount of cocoa used in chocolate. One of them is the use of cocoa butter equivalents, mixtures of triglycerides from multiple sources (e.g., sunflower oil, mango kernel, sal) that resemble cocoa butter in physical and chemical properties. In this project we will investigate the crystallization behaviour of selected CBEs from different origins, and compare it with that of cocoa butter. This study can enable the design of more sustainable chocolate recipes and manufacturing processes.\r\n","4363":"The interaction kinetics of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) with its payloads such as proteins and mRNAs controls product stability, loading and release efficiency, as well as efficacy after administered in the biological system. We still have very limited understanding of interactions between charged LNPs and the gene-editing therapeutic candidates such as mRNAs and RNPs. The aim of the proposal is to investigate the structural dynamics of LNPs upon mRNAs and ribonucleoprotein (RNPs) loading on a millisecond time scale using the rapid mixing stopped-flow BioSAXS facility at the ID02 beamline. Steady state SAXS experiment has shown that the ionisable ALC-0315 lipid can form lyotropic liquid crystalline cubic and hexagonal mesophases which are responsive to pH. We will investigate how model mRNAs and RNPs drive nanostructural changes of cationic LNPs, including the BioNTech\/Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (ALC-0315 and ALC-0159), and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine LNPs (SM-102 and PEG-DMG).","4391":"In this proposal we aim to understand how the composition of graphite nanoplatelet-based inks for printed flexible conductors affects the ink\u2019s structural response to shear forces during printing by performing rheo-SAXS experiments at ID02. We will investigate the effects of: graphite loading, aspect ratio, and additives on shear-induced structural rearrangements like platelet alignment, which will affect the conductivity of printed conductors. Moreover, we aim to understand the previously observed heat-induced gelation mechanism on a structural level, which is essential for ink spreading behavior on substrates. We have recently investigated the static colloidal properties of our graphite dispersions at ID02 (proposal SC5184) and now would like to focus on the dynamic properties by simulating printing conditions with rheo-SAXS. ","4414":"Carrageenan and gelatin are biopolymers that may form hydrogels upon cooling. They are commonly used in the food industry as thickening or gelling agents, and more recently in cosmetics and pharmaceutics Here, we present an atypical carrageenan: Kappa\/iota hybrid carrageenan (KI): a linear biopolymers with a random sequence of kappa and iota segment. KI does not display synaereses (expulsion of the solvent) during gelation contrary to classical carrageenan and it is plant based contrary to gelatin. It is therefore well suited industrial application and it will make greener and healthier materials. We aim to study the structural and rheological behaviour of those polymers during the sol-gel transition and to understand the particularity of KI suspensions compared to classical carrageenan and gelatin suspensisons.","4466":"Hybrid perovskite structures are promising materials for inexpensive and efficient solar cells. In particular formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite has shown to be a promising material for single-junction solar cells, reaching a certified power conversion efficiency of over 25%. However, FAPbI3 solar cells face one hurdle on the way to commercialization. The desired black alpha-phase FAPbI3 can spontaneously transform into a photoinactive delta-phase at room temperature. Therefore, the realization of stable and pure phase alpha-FAPbI3 perovskites is of utmost importance. The production method has a huge impact on the crystallization pathway and the quality of the final film. Here we propose a comparative real time study of the three most promising methods: annealing, gas quenching and anti-solvent method. This will give us insight into the different crystallization pathways and how they impact the quality of the resulting film."},"title":{"4":"Understanding the structure of two-dimensional
