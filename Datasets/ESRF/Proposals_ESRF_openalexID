On one hand, their therapeutic efficacy and toxicity depend on how they transform in the organism after administration and how they degrade, where the excess of iron is regulated by ferritin-like proteins in homeostasis processes. On the other hand, remagnetization and recrystallization of magnetic phases can occur from the biosynthesis of degraded elements inside cells. We therefore propose a time-comprehensive study by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of the nanoparticles in the cellular environment at different stages of tissue maturation. The electronic structure of Fe and other elements that take part of the nanostructures (Co and Zn) will be probed to track the different phases formed during their degradation or re-biosynthesis inside cells.

HR-PXRD has been already exploited (ID22) with the known isomorphous Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4-bis(pyrazol-4-yl)benzene] [1], unveiling the CO2\/framework interactions. The same experiment on Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 will enable us to unveil its CO2 adsorption sites and host-guest interactions, thus disclosing the role of the NH2-function in the adsorption process. Also through a comparison with the HR-PXRD results obtained on Fe2(BDP)3, this experiment will allow a deeper understanding of the improved CO2 separation properties we observed after amino functionalization.[2] This will also open the way to the design and synthesis of improved, new generation adsorbents.","141":"Al parts might be subjected to overloads leading to voids, cracks and the replacement of the part. A promising solution is to use self-healing material. A self-healing Al alloy was produced by SLM based on Al-Si and Mg powder. The microstructure is composed of a Si network and Mg2Si precipitates in a \u03b1-Al matrix. During an overload, void nucleation occurs due to fracture of the Si network and of precipitates. The idea is to use a heat treatment to trigger the diffusion of the healing agents to the cavities. The healing potential of fractured Mg2Si was already proven but the SLM microstructure is different and its influence on the healing efficiency and kinetics needs to be investigated. Nanoholotomography allows observing the same area before and after healing in order to track the damage and to assess the healing potential of the material. As the SLM microstructure will not be noticeable, FIB-SEM will be used to evidence the influence of the microstructure on the healing efficiency.","143":"The BAG includes numerous principal investigators which are the majority of structural biologists in Israel.

The claim of the spin-liquid state realized in Na2BaCo(PO4)2 relies on the presence of an undistorted triangular geometry of the magnetic Co2+ ions. We surmise that this geometry may be in fact distorted as a result of cooperative rotations of the CoO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, and shall challenge this conjecture by high-resolution and total-scattering measurements at ID22. Our experiment will establish real structure of Na2BaCo(PO4)2 at low temperatures, shed light on the relevance of the spin-liquid scenario for this compound, and offer new insights into the structural chemistry of glaserite compounds.","157":"This proposal aims at implementing a new access route to the ESRF structural analysis capacities for the Heritage Science community. The upgrade to the ESRF-EBS was the triggering element to propose a single block allocation group (BAG). After discussion with multiple interested research teams, it was decided to target two complementary analytical configurations at the ESRF: High angular resolution XRD (ID22) and High lateral resolution XRD (ID13). The combination of these two beamlines generates precious clues on the origin, processing and degradation of historical materials. The new analytical capacities of the EBS, combined with an optimized access route is expected to increase the output of the Cultural Heritage community, to reinforce a scientific network of expert users structured around the ESRF, and to initiate new European collaborations in Heritage Science.","165":"The BAG groups 8 teams from 4 Marseille laboratories.

To be added that during the ESRF shutdown all the activities of the BAG have moved to Soleil and the moving back of activities to ESRF is affected by natural inertia. 2 shifts for 6 month at the BIOSAXS beamline, split up in two sessions, suit our needs. Two teams of the BAG combine structural biology with medicinal chemistry and beam time at MASSIF for large ligand-screening campaigns will mostly suit their research purposes.

Today all structural biology groups are turning to cryo-EM. The EM demand is therefore extremely high and present in the 4 Institutes. \r\nIn a nutshell, there are 42 PIs that could benefit from Krios time on the EPN campus (more than 90 different samples). Around 20 % of the sample are ready for high resolution data collection with already prepared grids that have been pre-screened on Glacios microscopes. Whereas some work could be carried out on Glacios microscopes, for difficult samples the use of a krios is indispensable (heterogeneous sample or limited concentration requiring a large number of images; small protein etc). Only these samples will be selected for Krios time at the BAG level.\r\n","202":"This proposal gathers Principal investigators from French Institutions that use cryo-EM to unravel the molecular mechanisms associated with various biological processes.

The potential for postharvest Cd mitigation during fermentation was recently highlighted. Data suggest that cacao fermentation induces a mobilization of Cd in the cacao nibs (the inner part of the bean), followed by outward migration of Cd from the nib to the testa (the shell) and the mucilage. It is hypothesized that Cd mobilization during fermentation is related to breakdown of phytate in the nibs and consecutive release of phytate-bound Cd. Bulk XANES analysis can offer crucial knowledge to identify whether this correlation between phytate breakdown and nib Cd mobilization is causational or not. This knowledge can lead to the development of post-harvest techniques to reduce the Cd content in cacao beans.","214":"The BAG includes groups situated at four Flemish universities: Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent and Leuven.

Many projects deal with membrane proteins, cell surface receptors and protein-protein complexes. Central to the research in the BAG associated groups is the employment of integrative methods in structural biology combining X-ray crystallography, SAXS, and cryo-electron microscopy.

The low temperature magnetic data for FeNb suggest that the observed pressure-induced SCO occurs in an ordered manner leading to the change of the ferrimagnetic ordering to the antiferromagnetic one and then to a paramagnetic state around 1.0 GPa. Each of these pressure-induced magnetic phases is expected to show a different photomagnetic response.

Interestingly, despite their beautiful coloration these photonic structures are far from perfect, and often contain a \u201ccertain amount\u201d of structural disorder. While this is optimized in nature, man-made approaches to producing similarly brilliant colors are still in their infancy. Currently, the big stumbling block is the lack of a measure of the degree of order in the biological \u201cblueprint\u201d. We propose the use of ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) for a statistically meaningful quantification of the degree of order in 3D photonic structures found in weevil scales that contain various degrees of disorder, nicely demonstrating nature\u2019s common approach towards producing distinct coloration. We therefore expect the USAXS experiments proposed here to shed light on the fundamental coloration mechanisms in weevils and similar biophotonic structures.","236":"The BAG is quite large with 24 principal investigators covering almost all groups in Israel.

There are several projects that are directed towards molecular recognition with implementation towards drug design.   In addition, we still have the ribosome project and the design of unique antibiotics with specific functional interactions from the mycinamycins family and their resistance related mechanism compared with other macrolides and the photosystem and how it converts light into energy.

Although the mechanism of DMTM is debated, Cu(I)\/(II) redox speciation, and especially Cu reducibility, plays a key role in this reaction. Currently, the main technique used to quantitatively assess Cu oxidation state in these materials is XANES spectroscopy. We have been currently developing a new technique to titrate Cu(I) on such systems, based on the specific interaction of CO with this species, that exploits isothermal volumetric adsorption as a quantitative tool. This methodology, however, could be affected by the lack of accessibility of Cu(I) ions by CO within the zeolitic framework.

The main focus of these studies was mainly on catalyst deactivation and formation of coke precursors within the pores (unit cell expansion). Our aim is to study the MTO process applying time resolved high energy PXRD in order to assess the dynamic behavior of selected zeolite frameworks in dedicated transient experiments. We will i) look at the time-resolved changes in lattice parameters during and after short controlled pulses of methanol to study the dynamics of the framework in the active period of the catalyst; ii) we will correlate this behavior with the timing of release of the products, possibly indicating the direct dynamic involvement of the framework in the reaction","445":"Our work is devoted to the study of the interplay between gas adsorption and dynamics in Metal Organic Frameworks.

Moreover, gas adsorption could also trigger structural rearrangement of MOF structure that can affect the rotational behaviour of molecular rotors. In our endeavour to fabricate switchable ferroelectric materials and porous dynamic materials for ultra-low concentration gas detection, it would be of extreme importance the study of the interplay between gas adsorption, molecular rotors dynamic and structural phase transitions.

A promising solution is thus to use self-healing material. A self-healing Al alloy was produced by LPBF using liquid-asssisted healing strategy. The microstructure is composed of high melting point Al cells surrounded by a lower melting point eutectic network. During an overload, void nucleation occurs due to fracture of the eutectic network. The idea is to apply a heat treatment to trigger the melting of the low melting point eutectic phase which can thus flow and fill the voids due to damage. The healing potential of these LPBF Al-Mg alloys was already proven but the mechanical properties of the developed healable Al-Mg alloy are rather low compared to other high strength Al alloys. Alloying elements were thus introduced in the material and their effect on the healing efficiency should be analysed.

However, the polymerization itself is not yet well-understood. To investigate key reaction parameters, we will systematically vary our growth conditions and monitor COF formation in situ by ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering at ESRF ID02. We hypothesize that COF single crystals form via simultaneous polymerization and crystallization processes, unlike polycrystalline COFs that polymerize much faster than they crystallize.

By using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) and by reacting CO2 from the gas phase, high eCO2R current density can be achieved. GDEs, however, degrade fast during eCO2R due to flooding by the electrolyte, thus operating for < 100 h. Flooding can be curbed in polymer GDEs using hydrophobic substrates, but it can still be induced by precipitation of hygroscopic carbonate crystals in the GDE due to CO2 dissolution. In our previous work, polymer GDEs of small pore size were 50x more stable than their large pore size counterpart (< 1 h to > 50 h). We thus propose to use operando XRD in Beamline ID31 to study carbonate precipitation during eCO2R, its kinetics and its dependence on GDE pore size. As GDE degradation is the most severe issue facing eCO2R, these results will provide fundamental understanding as well as important technological guidelines.","540":"The proposed LTP shall enable us to link tightly high-resolution 3D imaging at ID16B with processing to establish more enhanced all solid-state batteries (ASSB).

Incorporation of the dopant can occur via two pathways: by substitution with the B-site metal or by occupation of interstitial sites\/grain boundary in the lattice. Depending on the incorporation type, the cationic\/anionic charge state and occupancy would be modified to neutralize the overall system, leading to distinct changes in the lattice and band structures creating measurable structural and optical signatures. For the doping case it is important to know where the dopant is sitting and how it is helping to reduce the spontaneous strain, which call for systematic local atomic structure and electronic state characterization of Cs and I atom in series of Bi3+ doped CsPbI3 to investigate the underlying operation and phase degradation mechanisms.

In the case of Cr, the hexavalent species, Cr(VI), is a highly mobile and toxic pollutant. Cr(VI) can often leach into groundwaters, making it crucial to understand the processes that control its mobility. Fe (oxyhydr)oxides are usually the main mineral phase in the most weathered zones of Ni laterites, and are critical hosts for Cr species. However, their role in the redox behavior and partitioning of Cr species, as well as the mechanisms involved in sequestration or release into (ground)waters is unknown. To address this, we will probe the speciation and local bonding environment of Cr in both natural Ni laterite samples and synthetic analogues using Cr K-edge XAS. Thus, we can quantify speciation changes along a vertical redox gradient in Ni laterite profiles, and evaluate Cr leaching potential into groundwaters.","582":"The Netherlands BAG includes structural biology and enzymology groups situated at six Dutch universities (Utrecht, Groningen, Wageningen, Leiden, Eindhoven and Maastricht) and at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, with a total of fourteen PIs.

WAXS and SAXS have traditionally been used to study the nano-scale polymorphism during fat crystallization. The polymorphs further arrange into crystal nanoplatelets (CNPs), which are the building blocks of the fat crystal network. SAXS analysis enables to quantify the average CNP thickness and the thickness distribution. More recently, on the meso-scale, USAXS is used to estimate size, shape and aggregation of CNPs.

X-ray diffraction shows that reduction leads to the formation of Ni-In alloys, which are responsible for the increased activity and selectivity. To link the phase composition and morphology of these alloys to the catalytic performance, a set of operando SAXS\/WAXS experiments is necessary.

Ordering phenomena towards low temperature stepwise reduce the symmetry from the highly conduction, rhombohedral R-3c aristo structure towards monoclinic structures (C2\/c, Cc, P21\/c, P21\/n), yet most of the intermediate states are unsolved and transition phenomena not fully understood. Using a combination of in-situ single \u2013 crystal and powder X-ray diffraction measurements (200 K <= T <= 600 K), the structural phase transition sequences will be studied on 4 representative compositions. From the obtained data we will be able to develop a general model for structural phase traditions in the NaSICON family of compounds having high potential in modern energy related material science.","1201":"Humans and other large organisms are three-dimensional multiscale biological systems where large scale function and structure are dependent on the macrostructure\u2019s interconnectivity down to the cellular and subcellular level.

Since cocoa trees only grow in some tropical areas, this increased demand have pushed farmers to convert regions of intact forests into cocoa plantations. Between 2001 and 2014 Ghana lost 175,000 hectares of forest due to cocoa expansion. Such amount of deforestation can have a serious impact on biodiversity and climate change. For this reason, food manufacturers have started to develop strategies to replace or reduce the amount of cocoa used in chocolate. One of them is the use of cocoa butter equivalents, mixtures of triglycerides from multiple sources (e.g., sunflower oil, mango kernel, sal) that resemble cocoa butter in physical and chemical properties.

Meanwhile, growing graphene on liquid catalysts at lower temperatures is of great technical and economic interest. One important candidate is tin, which has a relatively low melting point (505 K) and an exceptionally low vapor pressure. However, tin has very low catalytic activity for graphene growth. Hence, an alloy between tin and a more active metal can provide a compromise between a lower melting point and enough catalytic activity.

Due to the short time scales, 3D imaging of these pore-scale phenomena has hitherto been limited to snapshots before and after the process has taken place. We thus propose original measurement strategies for i) real-time 3D imaging of steady-state multiphase flow fluctuations, and ii) reversible Haines jumps.

This can occur in the presence of native reductants, such as ascorbate or glutathione (GSH), under aerobic conditions. Based on the literature and our recent results, the lysosome might be an important place of action for these Cu-L. Moreover, the GSH oxidation by Cu-phenanthroline complexes increased at lower pH, such as the typical lysosome value 5. Therefore, the present project aims to understand why the catalytic activity increases at lower pH. This is of fundamental interest as thiol reactivity normally drops with pH and this finding could be of importance in the anticancer mechanism.","2069":"We propose to study the Cu speciation in a chronosequence of low-Cu acidic soils characterized by increasing vine age, which received repeated inputs of Cu-based fungicide.

Furthermore, isotopic analyses on the Cu-fungicide and the three soil profiles revealed unexpected results and a large isotopic variability. Our aim is to (1) study the temporal evolution of speciation of Cu from the fungicide after deposition on the vineyard soils and (2) investigate the drivers of Cu redistribution processes and the dominant bearing phases responsible for Cu mobility with depth in the soil profile. Due to the very low Cu concentration in soils, from 2 to 120 \u03bcg.g-1, we propose to combine XANES and EXAFS analyses to decipher the fate of Cu in vineyard soils affected by long-term Cu-fungicide application.","2074":"The portfolio of this BAG includes structural investigation of membrane proteins as well as soluble proteins relevant to various scientific fields.

We have recently shown that structural changes in CarH after light absorption can be followed by time-resolved X-ray scattering (LS-2958). To disentangle tertiary and quaternary signals, we performed a second experiment ( LS-3091) on a mutant (H132A-CarH) and a homolog of CarH in which quaternary changes are prevented or modified, respectively. The previous experiments enabled us to follow the cascade of structural events occurring in CarH on a time scale from \u00b5s to hundreds of ms. A comparison with static data showed that the relevant time scale of the photoreaction in native CarH extends longer than hundreds of ms, most likely because of the presence of large scale slow quaternary changes leading to the photoproduct. Here we propose to complete our study by collecting time-resolved scattering data in native CarH on the time scale from ms to several s.","2308":"The aim of the JSBG BAG proposal for ID29 beamline is to develop new methods for time-resolved serial crystallography experiments at 4th generation source and to study time dependent structural conformation of biological macromolecules that are studies at the ESRF-EMBL-GR Joint Structural Biology Group.

Accurate P-V-T equations of state (EoS) of relevant materials are of capital importance to better constrain the structure, dynamic and evolution of icy worlds.

The effect of mechanical stress on the temperature-dependent AFE phase boundaries. Investigating this relationship is crucial to implement lead-free AFE materials into applications by improving the working temperature range of AgNbO3-based capacitors. Therefore, we propose an in situ mechanical stress and temperature-dependent investigation of AgNbO3 crystal structure to reveal the effect of bias stress on the AFE phase stability and thus allow the use of bias stress to modify the AFE phase stability of other material systems.

Currently, no analytical method can observe both solution-phase and solid-phase concentration gradients simultaneously in LIBs. In collaboration with the ESRF, we recently demonstrated the ability to visualize both the solution-phase Li+ gradient and solid-phase state of charge (SoC) simultaneously through tandem X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) at the ID-31 beamline.

Ni(I) formation is likely dependent on the presence in the reduced-TiO2 nanoparticles ('grey' titania) of surface Ti(III) sites, thus creating an artificial redox chain based on a monovalent nickel (Ni(I)) electron transfer relay.

Now we have reached a neat advancement by inserting ultra-fast dipolar rotors in metal-organic framework  (MOFs) of the family of frustrated trigonal rotors (FTRs), generating fast responsive and switchable ferroelectric materials for memories and electrically driven optical devices. Therefore,  it would be challenging to detect order-disorder transitions of such new dynamical materials at extremely low temperatures by synchrotron-source X-ray diffraction. Moreover, identifying rotor conformations, occupation of specific sites and symmetry changes as a function of temperature  will help explain unprecedented mobility and the mechanism of motion in the solid-state.","2800":"This project investigates the effect of high pressure (hp) on the structural stability and architecture of nanometric supramolecular associates and molecular conformations in selected alcohols as model hydrogen-bonding (HB) systems.

On the one hand, Cr as foreign element at the interface was detected by the SEM and TEM analysis. On the other hand, it was possible to show that many LSCF grains at the interface show differences in their elemental composition. While it was possible to analyze the elemental composition of the impurities at the interface via TEM, so far the local crystal structure of the impurities \/ changes could not be revealed.  Therefore the extraordinary lateral resolution of the X-ray Laue microdiffraction could be the key analytical tool to clarify, if the local change in chemical composition also leads to a structural change of the material, e.g. LSCF locally transforms from a perovskite to a Ruddlesden-Popper \/ double perovskite structure.

While electron diffraction in TEM along the [001] zone axis seem to confirm the structure of ZIF-L, we could not obtain in-depth understanding of lattice parameter and crystallinity of the ZIF-L film, partly arising from the fact that ZIF-L is not stable under the electron beam. In particular, our interest is to understand the similarilty and differences of the novel 2d film with reference to the known 3D structure.

With the advent of energy resolution better than 35 meV at the Cu L3-edge, it has been possible to study the bond stretching phonon mode at ~70meV and its coupling to the electronic charge order. We recently performed Cu L3 RIXS on a cuprate superconductor and discovered a never before reported mode with sub 1eV energy. There are many possibilities for its origin, including charge, magnetic or lattice excitations. We propose to investigate the physical origin of this mode by leveraging the unique capability of ERIXS to resolve the polarization of the scattered photon.","2912":"FeNC catalysts are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells while their stability need to be improved. Due to their heterogeneous composition, it is difficult to discriminate the contribution of the various iron sites to the activity and degradation. During the ORR, oxygen is either reduced to water or to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is suggested that H2O2 formation is one of the main reasons for the instability. It\u2019s relevance for degradation might decrease, when the catalyst is capable of the further reduction of hydrogen peroxide. In this beam time, we will explore the potential induced changes of iron sites at different conditions to identify which iron sites contribute to which step(s) of the ORR mechanism.

These calculations predict the stability of crystalline pCO phases that were never experimentally attained, probably because of the kinetic hindrance of this transformation.

Materials  where the Tc is overlapped to the TMT temperature have attracted interest for multifunctional properties as magnetocaloric and magnetomechanical coupling. Due to the high brittleness of these systems, attention has been devoted to sintering routes. The tuning of the grain and microstructure gives a modulation of TMT temperatures, and  the shift of its temperatures to overlap with Tc. The correlation of magnetic and martensitic transition could be influenced by local order of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state. The stored energy due to the sintering process could induce structural distortion that influence the magnetic order. An investigation of microstructure and a description of its cell parameter is interesting in NiMnGa samples, where the Tc and the TMT temperatures are far or near to be overlapped.","2947":"Bismuth (Bi)-based catalysts have the potential to produce formic acid  through electrochemical CO2 conversion. The inevitable reconstruction of catalysts under working conditions is unfortunately not well understood, resulting in inaccurate understanding of structure-property relationships.

A selectivity (97%) of CO2 to formic acid was obtained with current density up to 156 mA\/cm2 on BOB, whereas BOC displayed a lower selectivity (80%) with current density of 116 mA\/cm2.  In order to elucidate the real active sites, we propose to perform in situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy at the Bi L3 edge.

Here we propose a methodology combining digital volume correlation based on x-ray tomography with line beam and scanning 3DXRD. This combination of techniques will allow us to study intragranular variation of strain and orientation, follow grains even after yield, and obtain information on the shapes and sizes of the grains in the material. This also makes it possible to extract local stress-strain curves from different regions of the sample.\r\nSuch information will be very useful in understanding the micromechanics of the materials, in terms of e.g. yielding behavior, and can also be used to calibrate numerical material models.","2980":"Gas hydrates are crystalline hydrogen-bonded water frameworks encaging gas atoms or molecules at high gas densities. Hydrates of natural gas occurs on the sea floor on Earth and hydrates of astrophysically relevant gases are candidate components for the interiors of the icy bodies of the outer Solar system. Due to its high weight percent of hydrogen, H2-hydrate is also a promising material for solid hydrogen storage, and pressure is a key parameter to explore this direction as it promotes novel stoichiometries with increased storage capacities as well as increased temperature ranges of stability. We propose to explore the stability and the structures formed by the H2-hydrate in the 50 GPa-150 GPa pressure range by x-ray diffraction in diamond anvil cell. Based on published calculations and by analogy with the high-pressure behaviour of CH4 hydrate, we expect that this system forms a new high-pressure structure above 50 GPa which will be stable in the Mbar range.","2984":"With the proposed experiment we aim to perform pair distribution function (PDF) analyses on 16 samples belonging to the Ce1-x(Nd0.74Tm0.26)xO2-x\/2 and\r\nthe Ce1-x(Nd0.63Dy0.37)xO2-x\/2 systems (x= 0.05-0.60). PDF analyses will be performed to gain information on the local structure of the present systems, trying to unravel the non-trivial relationship between their ionic conductivity and local structure. In fact, in Ce1-xRExO2-x\/2 systems (RE= trivalent rare earth ion), the high ionic conductivity observed between 673 and 973 K at low dopant amount is strictly related to the structural properties, even at the local scale, and to the occurrence of defect aggregates. Consequently, an in-depth structural study is fundamental to evaluate the chemical nature and the amount of the doping ions giving rise to the most efficient electrolytes for a possible application in solid oxide cells working at the intermediate temperature range.","3020":"Time-resolved X-ray tomography at light sources has experienced rapid development in the last 10 years, evolving from static or quasi-static 3D acquisitions to 3D movies at 200 Hz, as recently demonstrated. The rapid evolution of such techniques results from the improvement of sources, detectors, and reconstruction algorithms. However, the acquisition or rotation process has not been changed and has become a bottleneck to explore faster dynamics. For example, rotations induce shear forces that may alter the studied dynamics and difficult for the sample environment to probe such dynamics. We recently have demonstrated at\r\nESRF X-ray multi-projection imaging (XMPI) that avoids rotating the sample by illuminating it with several X-ray beams. Thus, we will demonstrate imaging of previously inaccessible dynamic processes evolving at timescales that cannot be accessed with currently existing techniques.","3079":"Metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au, are widely employed for biomedical applications in the fields of diagnosis or drug\/gene among others.

The aim of this proposal is to study, by XANES and EXAFS techniques at the Au L3-edge, the electronic and structural modifications induced in different Au NPs by changing their size, shape and aggregation state to correlate with the plasmonic and photothermal response. 3D aggregates of different dimensions will be analyzed determining the structural variations and the disorder effects generated in the nanostructures by the biological media. Cluster formation of NPs depends on the size and shape of NPs and it is a key parameter in the biomedical applications.","3104":"The BAG groups 11 teams from 6 Marseille laboratories. It has lately been reorganized, with 2 PIs changing affiliation, and 2 laboratories revisiting internal organisation, but mutual understanding amongst all PIs provides a solid base for efficient organization of the BAG. Research revolves around infection, health and biotechnology. For the next beam time allocation period we could make efficient use of 10 MX and 2 SAXS shifts. This amount of beam time reflects what we had asked for in previous rounds. 3 teams combine structural biology with medicinal chemistry and beam time at MASSIF for large ligand-screening campaigns will mostly suit their purpose. Access to beamlines with tuneable energy will be instrumental for projects requiring experimental phasing. One team uses exclusively Bio-SAXS and allocation of one shift\/session would be welcomed. Remote access for MX sessions has become very popular whereas scientists prefer to be on-site for Bio-SAXS experiments.","3121":"The understanding of covalency in the chemical bonding between transition metal ions and anions or molecules (ligands) is critical to a vast number of disciplines. We have recently demonstrated that direct experimental evidence of magnetic moment delocalization, i.e. covalency, onto chloride ions in paramagnetic molecules can be obtained through the observation of XMCD at the chlorine K edges. In this proposal, we will (1) expand this methodology to determine the covalency in the paramagnetic [ReBr6]2\u2013 as a function of secondary coordination sphere of the molecular entities, and (2) determine the relative covalency of Cl and P in the mixed ligand trans-[ReCl4(PPh3)2]. Experimentally, this information is accessible from the combined analysis of the XANES and XMCD at the Re L2,3, Br K, Cl K, P K edges \u2013 all of which are reachable at ID12. In a nutshell, both subprojects aim at establishing XMCD as a means for assessing covalency parameters in transition metal complexes and materials.","3131":"We have developed a novel gas-solid reactor design using non-stoichiometric oxides as oxygen-carrier materials (OCMs). The OCM develops a gradient\r\nin oxygen potential along the length of the chemical reactor. These varying oxidation potentials have many advantages, such as overcoming the chemical\r\nequilibrium constraints encountered in conventional reactors. We have demonstrated the principle of operation using the water-gas shift reaction and published high-impact publications in Nature Chemistry with ESRF co-authors and in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., ACS Appl. Energy Mater. and ACS Nano. We now seek to extend this work to direct, one-step methane-to-hydrogen production. This could be a breakthrough technology for a future low-carbon fuel economy. This work will involve two strands, (i) controlling the oxygen capacity and chemical potential via doping strategies and materials selection, (ii) producing OCMs with novel properties by harnessing exsolution processes.","3132":"Pannexins are homolgoues of gap junction channels that remain as single membrane channels to facilitate release of ATP and other ions through the channel pore. Pannexins are in three isoforms and we seek to study isoform 3 through cryoEM. PANX 3 is the shortest of the three isoforms and displays both calcium and atp release properties. The three isoforms differ in their pore organization and PANX3 displays the widest pore among the three from our earlier structure. We therefore seek to obtain an improved resolution structure of PANX3 at the ESRF CM01 cryoEM facility","3149":"Active materials for anodes of Na-ion batteries operating under conversion\/alloying mechanisms offer higher capacities than conventional intercalation materials but struggle with stability over many cycles. Their complex cycling mechanisms, when a material undergoes through a series of transformations combining crystalline and amorphous phases, make them challenging to understand on the basis of chemical structures even with the most informative operando techniques [1,2]. This experiment will focus on two main groups of materials: Bi and Sb-based compounds for Na-ion batteries.  Both types of materials create amorphous phases during cycling that we want to characterize with operando PDF to get a more complete understanding of their cycling mechanism. To do this we want to employ the use of multivariate analysis, allowing the separation of signals for easier analysis. For the Bi and Sb compounds, we also want to use operando XAS (XANES and EXAFS) to obtain element specific information. ","3182":"We aim to elucidate the role of Bi3+ as dopant in APbI3 hybrid halide pseudo-perovskites (A = CH3NH3+ (MA) or (CH3)3SO+ (TMSO)). These compounds present different connectivity of [PbI6] octahedra and, accordingly, a different structural dimensionality. This difference affects the electronic levels of the pristine compounds and, consequently, of the doped samples. Heterovalent doping on these perovskites significantly decreases the bandgap and is massively beneficial for electric conductivity. Through XAFS measurements at Pb- and Bi- edges on samples with different Bi doping, we expect to elucidate the role of the local structure in changing the electronic structure and band gap of model compounds for thermoelectrics and photovoltaics.","3186":null,"3302":"Hybrid perovskite structures are promising materials for inexpensive and efficient solar cells. In particular formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite has shown to be a promising material for single-junction solar cells, reaching a certified power conversion efficiency of over 25%. However, FAPbI3 solar cells face one hurdle on the way to commercialization. The desired black alpha-phase FAPbI3 can spontaneously transform into a photoinactive delta-phase at room temperature. Therefore, the realization of stable and pure phase alpha-FAPbI3 perovskites is of utmost importance. The production method has a huge impact on the crystallization pathway and the quality of the final film. Here we propose a comparative real time study of the three most promising methods: annealing, gas quenching and anti-solvent method.

Depending on the chemistry and structure a wide range of interesting magnetic and electronic properties are known to exist among these materials, including ferroelectricity. However, there is no general consensus on the origin of ferroelectricity in these materials, and our understanding of the composition-structure-properties relationship is further complicated by the complex modulations, octahedral tilting patterns and mixed occupancy that is also known to exist for this class of materials. Here we propose a temperature dependent high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction investigation of the structures, modulations and mixed occupancies of a wide group of TTBs, namely ferroelectric Ba4A12Nb10O30 (A1 = Li, Na, K, Rb) and non-ferroelectric A24Bi2Nb10O30 (A2 = Na, K, Rb, Ba).","3438":"This LTP aims at setting a laser-driven dynamic compression platform on ID09 in order to perform ps time resolved X-ray diffraction pump probe experiments at high pressure.

With this new high power laser system, pressures in the 100 GPa range could then be generated, an order of magnitude higher than what can be presently achieved on ID09. Over the three years of the LTP, this dynamic compression platform will be mounted, interfaced with the synchrotron beam, tested and made user friendly so that other groups interested by Xray structural studies of matter under dynamical compression could use it.

","3569":"The aim of this proposal is to study the ability of radioluminescent nanoparticles (nanoscintillators) to potentiate synchrotron radiotherapy by inducing deep-tissue photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiation dose-enhancement effect (RDE). While the RDE effect results from an excess of energy deposited by photo- and Auger electrons that are created when X-rays interact with heavy-elements, PDT relies on photosensitizers (PS) that generate cytotoxic species upon light activation. As light penetrates weakly in tissues, PDT is usually limited to superficial tumors. To reach deep tumors, nanoscintillators can be used to locally convert X-rays into visible light and remotely induce PDT. In this project, we will investigate the ability of a nanoscintillator (Lu3Al5O12:Pr) conjugated to a clinically used PS (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) to induce a PDT and RDE effect in vitro in 2D and 3D cultures of pancreatic tumors.","3573":"We aim to investigate the strain fluctuations induced by TiN electrodes in epitaxial Si\/SiGe quantum well (QW) heterostructures for housing of spin qubits. For this, we employ Scanning Xray Diffraction Microscopy (SXDM) at low temperature. Strain fluctuations are expected to cause variations in the local electromagnetic potential in the QW, which will strongly influence the qubit performance. Qubits are operated at cryogenic temperatures, while the strain is dependent on temperature due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion. Thus measurements at low temperature are necessary to determine the strain distribution which will affect the qubit. We will compare the experimental results with Finite Element (FEM) simulations based on an edge-force model. We have chosen TiN as an electrode material because it is commonly used in CMOS processes, which are suitable due to their technological maturity to fabricate large arrays of qubits with homogenous properties.","3580":"Metal NPs are organised in metal core, surface coating, and protein corona. Optical microscopy suggests that degradation of these elements in cells occurs at different rates, but fluorescence probes can detach or get degraded. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using nanofocused X-ray is ideal to study the localisation of metal NPs with subcellular resolution. Recently, we developed a method to label surface coatings of NPs with brominated tags. This allowed performing XRF and XANES that confirmed differential cellular degradation of cores and coatings of Au NPs after long incubations. Yet, we do not know what happen at short incubations, or with the protein corona formed around those NPs. We want to use XRF maps in cells treated with colloidal NPs at ID16A to probe the relative localisation between Au cores, Br coatings and Gd-labelled proteins. This will provide new insight into the cellular degradation process of colloidal NPs, which is important to assess their potential as biomedical tools.","3595":"This research proposal aims for understanding the dynamic behaviour of single atom supported over CeO2 towards the CO2 hydrogenation reaction under operando conditions.

The study here will shed the light in understanding trend in supported single atom and sub nano-metric cluster catalysts across periodic table in 4d and 5d transition metals. With the results we expect to be able to evaluate (a) how dynamic are the single atoms\/clusters under CO2 hydrogenation conditions (b) what are the roles of active species evolved and (c) why single atom of certain metals favor reverse water gas shift reaction to make CO or alternatively prefers for methanation reaction to produce CH4.

The same technique has uncovered the existence of the pseudogap, i.e., a larger energy gap affecting only a fraction of the Fermi surface up to the temperature T*>>Tc. Less direct signatures of the pseudogap have been found in measurements other than ARPES, but the determination of T* is there not univocal. This is a problem in materials where ARPES cannot be performed, such as YBCO. We propose to use very high resolution RIXS to study the opening of the superconducting gap and of the pseudogap in YBCO. The sensitivity of RIXS to the gap opening has been recently demonstrated for BSCCO, for which ARPES and Raman spectroscopy were used as reference. We propose to use RIXS for the important case of the gaps of YBCO, with the goal of determining T*.","3613":"Electron transfer processes underlie the functional behaviour of many lanthanide-based compounds. Recently, a long-standing debate was settled via a combination of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy, substantiating that a reversible electron transfer between Eu2+ and Dy3+ is responsible for the persistent luminescence (long afterglow) of several aluminate and silicate crystals. However important, this discovery does not answer all questions on persistent luminescence and electron transfer between metal dopants in general. A significant hurdle that is yet to be taken is explaining how the charge is transported between the (photo)redox partners. It has been speculated that it can move through the host crystal\u2019s conduction band, be directly transferred between the lanthanides, or that a mobile intrinsic defect is involved.

The Mott insulating states of Sr2IrO4 and Ca2RuO4 are thought to be triggered by a combination of electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling. In Ca2RuO4, where spin-orbit coupling has a comparable energy scale to the crystal field splitting's, neutron scattering has successfully probed dispersive single magnon excitations. However, neutron scattering does not provide insight into the orbital character of these excitations. It is widely believed that interactions responsible for the Mott insulating state are encoded into this orbital texture. With the improvements provided by the ERIXS spectrometer, it is now possible to probe both orbital and spin excitations simultaneously in Ca2RuO4. We therefore propose to study the low-energy spin-orbital excitation spectrum of Ca2RuO4 via the oxygen K-edge at which ID32 delivers an energy resolution just below 30 meV.\r\n","3626":"The heterocomplex formed by the alarmin HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box 1) and cytokine CXCL12 is relevant in inflammation related diseases (e.g. cancer) as it promotes C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-dependent recruitment of inflammatory cells to injured tissues and exacerbates the immune response in pathological conditions. This heterocomplex is a fundamental drug-target, however its three-dimensional (3D) structure is still unknown because of the challenges posed by the intrinsic dynamics of the system. To obtain structural information on the heterocomplex assembly in solution we aim to integrate our biophysical data on the complex (obtained by means of NMR, MST, AUC) with SAXS measurements.

Our goal is to study the colour change by looking at several glass production parameters, by using experimental glasses, that follow the composition of Post-Roman archaeological glass fragments from Tintagel castle (UK). Using bulk and micro Fe and Mn K-edge XANES combined with micro XRF spectroscopy will enable the characterisation of the oxidation state of Fe and Mn in fragments produced using different parameters, and the study of the dichroic character of the archaeological samples.

Butene dimerization on zeolite or metal organic framework supported Ni based catalysts represents an appealing route to selectively synthesize linear olefins from undervalued cracking fractions. Despite constituting isolated Ni sites, the rate of butene dimerization varies substantially depending upon the catalyst support and shows the following trend: Ni-FAU >> Ni-CHA > Ni-MFI >> Ni-UiO-66. We hypothesize that the local chemical environment and the electronic properties of Ni encapsulated in different supports impact the activation of butene thereby resulting in substantially different rates for butene consumption. We therefore propose to investigate the structural and electronic properties of Ni in a series of Ni-CHA, Ni-MFI, Ni-FAU, and Ni-UiO-66 catalysts, with varying Ni content, via HERFD-XANES, VtC-XES, and EXAFS measurements.","3753":"In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) during different heat treatments will be applied to study the crystallisation mechanism and microstructural evolution of  Fe-Co soft magnetic alloys manufactured via Selective Laser Melting (SLM).

Major questions still remain about the growth strategies and tissues of these ancient crocodilians. Answering these questions is key for understanding the evolutionary history of living crocodilians and requires sampling broadly across fossil crocodilians using osteohistological methods. A challenge for this line of research is that classical osteohistology requires destructive sampling, and early crocodylomorphs are rare components of the fossil record. Synchrotron microtomography offers a non-destructive alternative to destructive approaches and has already shown great promise in imaging internal bone microstructures. In this study, we propose to use PPC-SR\u03bcCT at submicron voxel size to image osteohistological cross sections of the long bones of four key fossil species from South Africa. This study builds a framework for understanding growth strategies across Crocodylomoprha and other vertebrate clades.","3819":"Several theoretical proposals suggest that the microscopic origin of the superconductivity in high Tc cuprate superconductors might reside in the modulations of the electron density. However, charge density waves (CDW) demonstrated over years a clear competition with the superconductivity: they weaken below Tc and are enhanced by magnetic fields. The recently discovered charge density fluctuations (CDF) might instead represent the long-sought excitations, since their signal is not reduced below Tc. Here, we propose to study in YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 films the response of CDW and CDF to magnetic fields of the order of 1 T, which we will achieve using an optimized geometry with two permanent magnets and a concentrator, and that we already tested to induce a significant variation in the charge order signal.

The work will provide the first nanoscale 3D reconstructions of insect eyes and provide new insights into how this important compass cue is sensed by insects. If successful, our results will also lead to the first publications using nano-tomography to describe the fine detail of animal eyes.","5335":"We propose to develop time-resolved serial crystallography on powder to study ultrafast and non-reversible photoinduced charge-transfer transition in Prussian blue analogues nanocrystals. A previous experiment at ID09 revealed the complete phase switching within the thermal hysteresis, with volume and symmetry change towards a stable phase, precluding so usual pump-probe studies. A second experiment [CH-5458] revealed anisotropic lattice dynamics driven by photoinduced CT small-polarons. Here we propose to develop time-resolved serial crystallography for studying non-reversible processes by using a fresh powder sample for every laser shot. This will allow studying the global out-of-equilibrium dynamics, from the formation of CT small-polarons, to cooperative and macroscopic phase nucleation. Both processes involve volume expansion and symmetry change, fully characterized by shifts of the Bragg peaks, and which have to be probed by X-ray diffraction.","5338":"In this experiment, we will identify the dynamics of the (bulk) structural and morphological response of oxide-derived Cu and Ag-doped Cu electrocatalysts to potentiodynamic electrochemical and CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) conditions. We will record high energy diffraction pattern with ms time resolution during potential pulse experiments for varying potential ranges. Pulsing between and within capacitive, Faradaic, and catalytic conditions in CO2-containing and CO2-free electrolytes will allow us to differentiate between the bulk lattice response to the charged state, the surface chemistry and active state of the catalysts. Our comparative studies using size-selected Ag and Au particles will allow us to draw more general conclusion on the dynamics of catalysts under electrochemical conditions. Complementary operando small-angle X-ray scattering measurements on selected conditions will shine light on the morphological evolution under potentiostatic and \u2013dynamic CO2RR conditions.","5343":"In order to control their high redox activity, in living systems Cu ions are normally coordinated to proteins and short peptides. One of the main functions of Cu in biology is as a catalytic redox centre in enzymes where the role of Cu is often to activate dioxygen. The coordination chemistry of Cu(II) and Cu(I) bound to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are very different (e.g. in the case of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Similar differences in the coordination chemistry is also reported in the Cu-\u03b1-synuclein that is related to Parkinson disease. Such flexible Cu-IDP are quite competent in di-oxygen activation to form reactive oxygen species, which could contribute to the oxidative stress observed in the diseases.Hence a central question is how this redox process can occur. In fact, going from Cu(II) to Cu(I) and back needs a quite important rearrangement of the peptide around the Cu-ion. Answering this question is the main goal of the present proposal.","5347":"In condensed matter physics there is growing interest in correlated phenomena that arise via competing instabilities, such as those provided by systems like FeCr2S4 with its strong spin-orbital (SO) interaction that compete with Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions. In FeCr2S4 these strongly correlated phenomena are manifested as, e.g., a metal-to-insulator transition, colossal magnetoresistance and half-metallic ground state. Despite significant investigation for the last 50 years the exact space-group or even the crystal symmetry, of the low temperature phase is yet to be established. \r\nThe aim of this proposal is to establish the space-group of the system below 9 K. This will be done with high-resolution X-ray scattering at ID22 to have the best chance possible to observe the subtle structural changes that is expected, before Rietveld refinements are used to determine the symmetry. Time permitting, we will also collect data of the structure across the transitions at 165 K and 60 K.   \r\n","5354":"The defining feature of antiferroelectric materials is the unique phase transition from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric states induced by an external electric field, which is accompanied by a significant increase in polarization and strain. The aim of this experiment is to investigate the mechanisms of these transitions in newly emerging lead-free antiferroelectric materials. In particular, the focus is on the origin of reversibility. This goal will be achieved by studying the structural\/microstructural behaviour of three representative groups of antiferroelectrics in situ under electric field application while simultaneously measuring the macroscopic response. We expect to find structural origins responsible for reversibility, which is a prerequisite for the use of these materials in applications.","5359":"We propose to continue our investigation of the structural anisotropies in bulk metallic glasses with X-ray nano-diffraction. Our initial experiment at ID16B revealed large and unexpected structural anisotropies discovered by analyzing the full 2D diffraction pattern. The patterns showed large intensity variations as a function of the azimuthal angle. The results of the studies we propose on several samples with different growth conditions and degrees of stability can inform the relationship between the observed anisotropies and important properties of metallic glasses, pointing to the need to have structural information beyond the density-density pair distribution function.  Further, these studies may provide new information relevant to the glass transition, a long-standing open question in condensed matter physics.","5364":"Fast-charging Li-ion cells that are sufficiently power dense while also durable and safe will increase the competitiveness of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). To achieve this, the local state-of-charge (SoC_ and temperature must be sufficiently controlled. However, in practice this is highly challenging and informed design from experimental feedback is not possible as invasive methods are required to obtain such information. In these experiments we will employ ultra-fast powder X-ray diffraction computed tomography to monitor the crystallography of the current collectors and electrodes within operating lithium-ion batteries to map the temperature and SoC in real-time. These experiments would be the first of the report of dual-temperature and SoC mapping during operation and the findings will have immediate tangible impacts upon our fundamental understandings of battery operation for researchers, as well as providing much needed insight for cell designers within the commercial sphere. ","5371":null,"5385":"Green rust (GR) and greenalite are highly reactive, redox-sensitive iron (Fe) phases that are believed to have played a crucial role in cycling of Fe, key nutrients (e.g., P) and toxins (e.g., As) in Fe2+- and Si-rich deep Early Earth oceans ~2.4 billion years ago. Using an analogue of the Early Earth \u2018seawater\u2019, we followed the formation and transformation of GR and greenalite in the absence and presence of As and P. The combination of As and P is crucial because As(V) is a key competitor for phosphate, but highly toxic to all living cells. To assess to what extent the formation pathways of GR and greenalite in these early oceans would have shaped As toxicity and thus P bioavailability can tell us about how these processes affected the evolution of microbial processes (photosynthesis) and, ultimately, life as we know it today.","5386":"Among hydrated borates, inderite and inderborite are two mineralogical species which display a different H2O content (40 wt% in inderborite and 48 wt% in inderite, respectively). In the last years, our team have studied several hydrated borates, each one displaying one (or more) phase transition at high-pressure in the P-range 1.6-14 GPa. The findings suggest a linear correlation between the H2O content and the pressure at which a hydrated borate undergoes a phase transition, but more studies are needed in order to confirm a real trend. \r\nFurthermore, hydrated borates are believed to be a potential aggregate in radiation-shielding concretes due to the large cross section for thermal neutron of the isotope 10B.  A comprehensive characterization of the crystal-chemistry, elastic properties, stability and structural behavior of natural borates at varying T and P conditions is advisable for modelling their behavior as aggregates in radiation-shielding concretes.","5399":"We propose an experiment to study the intrinsic dynamics of the fast martensitic transformation in shape memory alloys. The kinetic laws of the martensitic transformation remain an open fundamental question due to the lack of experimental tools for inducing and tracking the process at the high-driving-force regime with sufficient time resolution.  The unique state-of-the-art CdTe Keck-PAD detector, allows us to fully utilize ESRF capabilities and break through current technological barriers of X-ray detection. The novel CdTe detector technology has superb quantum efficiency at energies over 40 keV and sub-microsecond time resolution, enabling a depth-resolved investigation of the phase transformation in typical high-quality NiTi wires of various diameters. Gradual increase of the X-ray energy allows for radially resolved detection by variation of penetration depth of austenite-martensite interfaces in the axisymmetric nano-crystalline material along different radii at different times.","5405":"We have devised two groups of Cu-based electrocatalysts through two approaches: surface modification with Ag single-atoms and co-catalysis between Cu and Nitrogen Doped Carbon (NDC). These catalysts electrochemically convert CO and CO2 to C1-C3 liquid products (e.g., acetate, ethanol, and propanol) at high selectivity. Electrochemical conversion of CO and CO2 to valuable chemicals is of large interest because it provides ways to recycle CO2. Using operando XAFS, combined with computational studies, we can investigate the influence of surface Ag and NDC additives and explain changes in selectivity trends. We aim to employ this state-of-the-art characterization technique to correlate the atomic bonding distance around the catalyst atomic center and coordination environment to the selectivity of our electrocatalysts towards liquid products. A better understanding of these electrochemical processes during the reaction is needed to foster further development.","5409":"In the uranium-oxygen system an interesting interplay between the uranium charge distribution and crystallographic properties exists. The application of diffraction techniques allows to resolve the structural elements, whereas the assessment of chemical states is usually performed from spectroscopic methods, separate from each other. Ambiguity sometimes remains on the actual charge localization, especially in complex molecules. We propose to perform DAFS around the U L3-edge (17.170 keV) on mixed-valence uranium oxides, in order to obtain site-specific information on the chemical state of uranium. These type of experiments, further supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, can provide a unique and unprecedented insight on the charge localization in uranium compounds, which is invaluable information with respect to nuclear fuel material properties.","5410":"The idea of producing a crystalline alloy with good properties based on a heavy mix of elements was completely new and pushed the boundaries of properties understanding beyond what was known so far from one- and two-element based alloys, leading to the discovery of High Entropy Alloys (HEA). A general lack of experimental data on the crystal structure and local distortions in HEA \u2013 all factors considered crucial for the understanding of mechanical properties \u2013 emerges from the latest reviews. This project plans to tackle directly some of these aspects: a bcc alloy, so-called Senkov alloy based on Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Hf elements, and its precursors, will be investigated by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The results will be then related to i) mechanical properties to be measured on the same compounds and integrated with the literature, and ii) on-going crystal structure investigation on similar hcp-based and fcc-based high entropy alloys.","5443":"Nitridic compounds with mixed cations are a highly diverse class of compounds. They feature immense structural diversity and intriguing properties such as thermal and chemical stability and ionic conductivity. However, extreme reaction conditions which are conditional to their synthesis yield microcrystalline samples and structural analysis is challenging. Ta8PN15 with the rare motif of PN6 octahedra was successfully investigated at ID11. Further syntheses now afforded TM-nitridophosphates (TM = Ta, Mn, Cr, V) and according to powder patterns, TM-nitridosilicatephosphates (TM = Cr, Mn) are the first nitridic amphiboles. In all these cases, electron diffraction can identify new compounds but the combination of TEM and synchrotron diffraction from micron-sized crystallites outperforms electron crystallography or powder diffraction by far. This investigation will extend this field towards the chemistry of transition metal compounds with promising properties and rare structural motifs.","5446":"This proposal is aimed at exploring the chemistry of Sb and N under extreme conditions, particularly focusing on the synthesis and characterization of antimony nitride. The study addresses fundamental issues about pnictogens chemistry and is relevant to the design and high pressure synthesis of new advanced materials.\r\n","5452":"shear thinning and shear thickening are two phenoma commonly observed when colloidal suspensions flow. Shear thinning corresponds to a decrease of the viscosity as the shear rate increases while shear thickening corresponds to an increase of the viscosity as the shear rate increases. Here, we will use a dispersion of carbon black particles (fractal colloidal particles of diameter 70nm) in oil to study the shear thinning effect and a dispersion of fumed silica particles (fractal colloidal particles of diameter 300nm) dispersed in Polypropylene glycol. Time Resolved Ultra Small Angle X-ray Scattering coupled to rheology will be used to monitor the structure of the dispersion along its flow curve. Decreasing the shear rate in shear thinning carbon black dispersions should lead to larger and larger clusters while we believe that it is the contrary in shear thickening fumed silica dispersions.","5455":"We propose to study the dynamics of synaptic vesicles (SV) [1] and of artificial lipid vesicles in dense vesicle pools by XPCS. Pools are aggregates of vesicles which are clustered together by proteins causing an attractive interaction. We target  in particular the short range (hindered) diffusion of vesicles which are believed to be at least partially arrested in the pool. Center-of-mass movements as well as relaxation of deformations and viscoelastic strain fields in the pool are expected to contribute to the XPCS signal, and will be disentangled via the q-dependence and by varying the sample setup (density, SV versus simple vesicles, protein concentration etc.). Here we extend our previous SAXS study of SV pools (SC-5112) by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) using highly brilliant ESRF undulator radiation. We want to understand how a vesicle diffuses within a dense cluster which is formed by gel-like interaction with specific proteins, notably synapsin.","5505":"Water electrolysis is a promising and environmentally friendly means for renewable energy storage. However, the difficulties met to replace Ir anodes by more abundant transition metal oxides (TMO) is hindering its development on a large scale. Despite numerous publications devoted to the investigation of TMOs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which occurs at the anode and largely dominates the energy losses, the nature of the active sites is not fully understood yet, hindering the development of materials for water electrolysis. TMOs with spinel structure constitute a promising class of materials due to a relatively low synthesis temperature, and to their composition-dependent and widely tunable properties. In this project we study core-shell Fe3O4@CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) annealed under an oxidative atmosphere to advance the understanding of the oxidation states of the NPs under these conditions and compare it to the oxidation under a potential performed previously.","5544":"U M4,5-edge RIXS measurements are proposed to study the electronic structure and bonding of air-sensitive non-aqueous model complexes that have been\r\n synthesised to broaden knowledge of 5f orbital contributions to actinide frontier molecular orbitals.

Particular attention is directed towards lower oxidation states U(IV) and\r\n U(III). The model complexes selected show evidence from density functional theory of covalent bonding involving the 5f orbitals. The results will be relevant to\r\n nuclear waste clean-up and recycling processes.\r\n","5549":"In paleoenvironmental archives such as peat and lake sediments, bromine (Br) generally show some correlation with organic matter (OM), but the relationship between Br and OM is not linear. The Br\/OM ratio has been proposed as a proxy of the origin of historical primary productivity (macrophytes vs planktonic). We hypothesize that Br speciation could be a finer paleoenvironmental proxy. To test this hypothesis, a better understanding the cycling of Br in sediments and of chemical changes occurring during burial and sediment diagenesis are needed. This proposal is a continuation of exp EV373. We wish to complement our dataset of Br K-edge bulk HERFD-XANES spectra, with sediments at low Br content, and sources compartment.","5573":"We propose to establish a new community-driven mode of access dedicated to the study of materials under rapid and extreme loading. This mode will utilise the block allocation group (BAG) model, pooling together shared equipment, personnel and expertise to underpin and enhance the science at the intersection of X-rays and dynamically-compressed matter. This Shock-BAG would build-upon the dedicated gas-gun, Hopkinson bar platforms, and multi-MHz X-ray imaging scheme arising from our recent LTP, offering these proven tools and expertise to grow the high-rate and shock user community at ESRF. In addition, the Shock-BAG would serve as a home for emergent techniques, such as pulsed power-, laser- and explosive-drive, which share similar challenges and diagnostic needs. The combination of these research tools will enable us to probe the properties of matter at extreme conditions, from damage in composites panels, to the physics of earthquakes.","5607":"The use of high energy X-ray diffraction is proposed to investigate operando the fine structure-activity-stability trends of carbon-supported platinum-rare earth (Pt-RE\/C) nanoalloys during the electrochemical conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

With the present proposal, we will combine two AST protocols for operando measurements, to make them more comparable to a \u201creal-life application\u201d and at the same time reduce the required measurement time substantially. We will apply the new concept of operando SAXS \/ WAXS measurements in a grazing incidence configuration allowing \u201ccatalyst-depth depending\u201d information. We will compare a bimodal Pt\/C catalysts with the respective monomodal catalysts. The combination of operando SAXS \/ WAXS measurements and ex-situ TEM analysis will be used to develop fitting models that will allow us to obtain probability functions similar to size histograms obtained in TEM analysis. Most importantly the model should not require the assumption of log-normal size distributions that does not take degradation phenomena into account.","5680":"Cost efficient and long-term stable catalysts are in great demand for the CO2 hydrogenation to methane, a key process involved in conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals and fuels. Recently we prepared Ni-doped ceria nanoparticles 3.5 times more active than conventional Ni-supported on ceria. After a detailed in-situ NAP-NEXAFS study we demonstrated the formation of tetrahedral (Td) NiO sites on the surface of ceria nanoparticles which are less reducible (in H2) than standard octahedral (Oh) NiO. However soft X-ray measurements are challenging at operando conditions (1 bar of gas) while Ce M4,5- and Ni L-edge did not give access to structural and electronic variations in a reaction-time scale. Therefore we propose here an operando hard X-rays XAFS\/DRIFTS of the two aforementioned catalyst to unlock Ni-Ce synergic electronic and structural behavior coupled with the precious IR information on the formed reaction intermediates finally aiming to describe the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism. ","5684":"The POLAR-2 instrument is a space-based X-\/gamma-ray polarimeter which will be launched in Spring 2025. The instrument is being developed by a Swiss, Polish, German and Chinese collaboration. It will perform polarization measurements of photons coming from a range of astrophysical sources. To perform such measurements it is of crucial importance to study the performance of the instrument prior to launch using a dedicated polarized beam. For this, X-rays at different energies from a well-controlled beam are required. The ESRF facility therefore forms the ideal location to verify the POLAR-2 detector concept. Measurements will be performed on the final prototype of POLAR-2 for a range of different energies and instrument configurations in order to gain a full understanding of the detector performance. The results of this study will form the basis of one scientific publication, whereas further lessons learned from this study can still be implemented in the final detector design.","5685":"This work will shed light on the behaviour of Fe-N-C catalysts during oxygen reduction reaction as well as on their deactivation mechanisms in an acid polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) device.

Simultaneously, building upon our previous work at ESRF, we will track water and ionic distributions throughout the MEA at different stages during the ASTs to differentiate catalyst decay mechanisms from changes in mass transport-related decay, which may arise from physical gas diffusion electrode (GDE) degradation leading to changes in properties such as porosity and hydrophobicity. Overall, in this proposal we seek to understand state-of-the-art CO2 electrolysis device degradation mechanisms through AST protocols by probing the operando chemical and morphological changes to the catalyst layer and its local hydration environment during operation.","5733":"The use of metabolic MRI has many clinical advantages and especially in identifying tumours at an early stage. However, the difficulty in obtaining a strong enough magnetic signal impedes its common use. For this MRI technique to work one needs to take advantage of the polarization of a metabolite which is unfortunately naturally only 1ppm. Here we propose to overcome this limitation by \"conjugating\" the desired metabolite with an inorganic mineral, in which the polarized state exhibits a relatively long relaxation time, and thus may serve as a spin reservoir and, via the process of spin diffusion, elongate the relaxation time of the metabolite. Hench, incorporating metabolites such as pyruvate into the lattice of a crystal should allow a much longer relaxation time and could potentially allow much longer and better imaging. Herein we will study the effect of incorporation of metabolites into the calcite on its lattice (ID22) and correlate it with polarization relaxations.

The compound is estimated to show a wide range of properties and possible applications like electrochemical water splitting, nonlinear optics or ferroelectricity.","5741":"Halide perovskites have complex short-\/long-range order, which is connected to their phase properties. This calls for novel ways to engineer strain and regulate phase, and suitable methods to characterization the phase transition dynamics. CsPbI3 perovskite is promising for optical applications; however, it is unstable under ambient conditions, forming a yellow non-perovskite phase, hindering adoption. This project aims to use Br-doped CsPbI3 crystals as a materials platform to examine radiation-induced disorder and phase stabilization: Stage I will induce local structural disorder via resonant X-ray absorption at Br sites, and Stage II will examine the microstructure and thermal-phase properties. This is motivated by preliminary data of synchrotron radiation-induced stabilization of CsPbI3 perovskite, opening a new paradigm for stabilization. However, this is only empirically understood, and experiments at SNBL-BM01 will help develop models to rationalize\/exploit these observations.","5771":"Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have shown superior performance in various electro-optic applications, such as  light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic cells, which depend on the interconversion of photons and mobile charge carriers. The charge carrier becomes thus dressed by a local lattice deformation, forming a polaron quasiparticle. Because of the weak-to-intermediate electron-phonon interaction in LHPs, large polarons develop, with the lattice distortion spanning over multiple lattice constants, i.e., a few nanometres. Our target is to identify the crystallographic phase, coordination chemistry, local octahedral tilting, disorder, etc. on illuminated CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with synthetically tuned morphologies of cubes, hexagon and polygons. For the development of the relation between particle shape and corresponding polaron, we have to performed temperature dependent wide angle x-ray scattering with and without applying femtosecond pulsed laser.","5781":"This proposal seeks to use grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to characterise the microstructure of vacuum thermally evaporated (VTE) organic photovoltaics (OPV), tuned with templating layers.

In the context of quantities probed via GIWAXS; molecular orientation plays a significant role in light absorption and molecular ordering affects charge carrier transport and recombination.  Templating layers can induce a different crystalline polymorph and preferred molecule orientation in overlayers.

This proposal will use Cu L-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of La2-xCexCuO4 (LCCO) to discover the spin polaron excitation and characterize its momentum and doping dependence. The properties of this mode will provide critical information about the unconventional electron liquid that hosts high-temperature superconductivity, how it interacts with spin correlations and deepen our understanding of the t-J model and its validity.

This proposal aims to perform a very accurate structural analysis at low temperatures of Eu2Pd2Sn in order to understand the origin of a soft-phonon-like excitation at around 25K observed in specific heat measurements. In particular this analysis could unveil if around that temperature a progressive change of structure between the high temperature orthorhombic and the suspected low temperature monoclinic polymorph occurs.

We are studying the impact of various Zn-based NMs, on their foliar uptake and bioavailability when deposited to pepper plants leaves. The NMs tested are bare ZnO NMs and surface modified ZnO NMs with Zn3(PO4)2.

This first order metamagnetic transition is generally interpreted in terms of the collapse of induced Rh magnetic moment at low temperature. The objective of this proposal is to study thermally driven chemical order transition and magnetism in bi-metallic FeRh nanoalloys. To reach this purpose, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism (XAS\/XMCD) experiments on ID12 will be performed at both Fe K-edges and Rh L-edges on in-situ UHV annealed mass-selected FeRh nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in amorphous carbon matrix.

Furthermore, preliminary results from our group focusing on the activation of C-H bonds in lower alkanes (\u2265 C2) over Cu-MOR, find no apparent differences with respect to the activation atmosphere (O2 or He). Therefore, with in situ XAS experiments, we want to monitor the Cu-species and track small variations in the local environment of Cu formed during the activation in different atmospheres (O2, He, H2O). This study promises to shed more insight on and facilitate a better understanding of the nuclearity of the active sites in relation to the methanol productivity, a crucial step for the further improvement of the DMTM reaction.","6572":"Monitoring changes in catalyst composition and structure during operation is of the utmost importance to derive unambiguous structure\/function relationships, and to guide the design of better catalysts. Our aim is to follow and elucidate changes of oxidation states, structure and coordination environments in Cu-In electrocatalysts during the CO2 reduction reaction by operando XAS. Cu-In materials have been recently shown to exhibit enhanced catalytic performance. We have recently established a synthetic framework which allows the tuning of the morphology of Cu-In nanoparticles, serving as a perfect tool to elucidate structure\/property relationships reliably. Lab-based electrochemical tests have established that the product distribution varies greatly as a function of these morphologies and differs from monometallic Cu and In catalysts of the same size, and synchrotron-based XAS studies are needed to further rationalise the sources of the performance variation. ","6585":"Technological functionality and sensory properties fat-containing food products often depends on the crystallization of the lipids present. Such food products are often suspensions, meaning they contain a dispersed particle phase in a continuous fat matrix. Most often, the dispersed phase is stabilized by a dispersing agent. Both dispersed phase and dispersing agent can influence fat crystallization. In this proposal, the effect of shear on fat crystallization in model suspensions will be investigated. The effect of different shear rates is expected to take place at different length scales (nano- to meso-scale) and thus to be visual both in SAXS and USAXS. Model systems comprising fat, food-grade particles and a dispersing agent will be studied. SAXS will allow to study the fat\u2019s chain length arrangement and crystal nanoplatelet thickness (CNP), while USAXS provides an estimate of the CNP size and the aggregation thereof.","6671":"Carrageenan and gelatin are biopolymers that may form hydrogels upon cooling. They are commonly used in the food industry as thickening or gelling agents, and more recently in cosmetics and pharmaceutics Here, we present an atypical carrageenan: Kappa\/iota hybrid carrageenan (KI): a linear biopolymers with a random sequence of kappa and iota segment. KI does not display synaereses (expulsion of the solvent) during gelation contrary to classical carrageenan and it is plant based contrary to gelatin. It is therefore well suited industrial application and it will make greener and healthier materials. We aim to study the structural and rheological behaviour of those polymers during the sol-gel transition and to understand the particularity of KI suspensions compared to classical carrageenan and gelatin suspensisons.","6826":"The proposed work is aimed at discovering a completely new magnetoelectric (ME) material, wherein we investigated the physical properties of a one-dimensional\r\n(1D) spin-chain compound MnSb2O4 by means of various comprehensive
