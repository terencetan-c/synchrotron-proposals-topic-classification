    "title":"Crystal structure of vermiculite and exfoliated single nanolayers.",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The aim of the following proposal is to determine crystal structure of natural vermiculite clays of different types using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction, before and after exfoliation into single nanolayers. Vermiculite is a 2:1 layered silicate, composed of 1 nm thin sheets kept together by interlayer cations. The structure of the thin nanolayer is complex, it consists of octahedral sheet sandwiched between the two tetrahedral sheets. \r\nWe have acquired 12 types of vermiculite originating from different areas in the world, and we have managed to exfoliate most of them into the single nanolayers. However, the exfoliation process does not work the same for all of these vermiculite types. As we do not know the exact crystal structure of our vermiculites, we hence cannot estimate the charge of the nanolayers, that will explain the exfoliability of the material.\r\n\r\n\r\n present in the interlayer, ensuring charge neutrality of the crystals. Structural formula is (Si4-x Alx) IV (Al2-y Mgy) VI O10(OH)2,(x+y)M + (dioctahedral) and (Si4-xAlx) IV (Mg3-yMy 3+ ) VI O10(OH)2,(x-y)\/2Mg 2. Individual nanosheet is a \"sandwich of sheets\" composed from two types of atomic sheets -two tetrahedral sheets sandwiching one octahedral sheet. All tetrahedra and octahedra have metal inside: Al and Si in case of tetrahedral sheet and Al, Mg and\/or M 2+ and M 3+, which is a divalent and trivalent metal, for the octahedral sheets. Vermiculite can be found in two different compositions, dioctahedral and trioctahedral. Interlayer cations are exchangeable, if the charge is low enough (around 0.6-0.7 per half unit cell). Exfoliation resulting into the dispersion of single sheets in liquid (water) allows large scale self-assembly production of layered nanocomposites by deposition on surface to form heterostructures, nanocomposites  Vermiculite crystal were first crushed to the fine powder and put into the glass capillaries (diameter 1 mm), closing the capillary with glue in case of the 1WL layer hydrated vermiculite, and using glass wool for samples prepared for in-situ drying. During in-situ drying of samples, samples were exposed to water first, then heated up upon constant pumping of vapour, from 50-90 \u02daC with a rate 60 K\/hour and subsequently heated up to 120 \u02daC with the same ramp rate and kept at 120 degrees for a time which was necessary for complete drying of the samples. Dry samples were further exposed to liquid H2O2, in order to study in-situ delamination of the layers Data has been processed using Bubble  which was sucked into the powder just by the capillary forces due to the presence of glass wool and small diameter of capillary. Use of pump to suck liquid into the powder was not needed. We observed that intercalation happens immediately after exposure of powder vermiculite to liquids we chose. However, in case of water, just several layers were hydrated, which allowed us to determine which cations we have in the interlayer, when we combined these results with elemental analysis we have from XPS (see Table  d 001\/I sample K Non-hydr.

    "title":"Time-resolved monitoring of structural changes during in situ hydration of starch granules",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The water content in starchy substrates impacts their formulation, properties, processing and aging. In particular, the structural characteristics of native starch granules at different lengthscales (lamellar repeat and degree of crystallinity) are generally determined after a several-day equilibration of starch powders (a few hundred milligrams) at controlled relative humidity. Our experiments aim at shedding light on the hydration dynamics by monitoring the structural changes over the course of a few hours, as a function of the amylose\/amylopectin ratio and allomorphic type of the granules, to rationalize the equilibration process. Moreover, by simultaneously collecting time-resolved WAXS and SAXS data, we will assess the correlation between the long-range lamellar order and short-range crystal structure in the starch granules upon hydration. Starch, the major energy reserve of higher plants and the main source of calories in our diet, is widely used in food and non-food industries. Starch is a mixture of two homopolymers of glucose, namely linear amylose (~20 wt%) and branched amylopectin (~80 wt%). Although their shape and size (1 to 100 \u00b5m) depend on their botanical origin, all native starch granules exhibit a multilayered organization with different structural lengthscales: i) alternating semicrystalline and amorphous growth rings (200-600 nm) and ii) alternating crystalline and amorphous lamellae from the clustered distribution of amylopectin branches, with a repeat distance of 9-10 nm  Sample preparation. Powders of native starch granules, amylose spherulites and amylose-ibuprofen complexes were previously dried into primary vacuum during 24 h and the partial disappearance of the semicrystalline structure was assessed by laboratory WAXS. The semi-dry powders were rapidly poured into 3-mm (o.d.) glass tubes folded into a L-shape in a flame. The powders were maintained with of porous Teflon wool at both ends, close to the fold (Fig.  Experimental set-up. The tubes were mounted on an automatic sample changer and the top of each tube was connected by silicon pipes to the hydration system that was lent by the PSCM platform (Fig.  Native starch granules yield powder XRD patterns corresponding to one of two distinct allomorphs (mainly monoclinic A-type and hexagonal B-type) or a mixture of both. In both cases, the crystals contain double-helical chains stabilized by a number of water molecules. Preliminary results from the collected data show that changes in the relative intensities of the WAXS profiles upon hydration can be detected within the first hour of hydration, the crystallinity slowly developing afterwards (Fig.  The literature reports that reaching maximum water uptake by a few hundred milligrams of starch granules requires several days of equilibration at a relative humidity of 95%. In our experiments, although we only used a few milligrams and blew a humid nitrogen atmosphere through the specimens, the hydration process, as judged by the evolution of crystallinity, remained rather slow. However, during experiments carried out over several hours (typically between 3 and 12 h), preliminary data treatment showed that it was possible to detect changes in peak position and relative peak intensity in WAXS patterns. Further processing of the WAXS and SAXS data should provide information on the dynamics of these early stages of hydration and subsequent drying, and on differences that may depend on the crystal type, granule size, amylose\/amylopectin ratio, etc. We will evaluate the possible correlation of the ordering processes in starch granules at different lengthscales as well.

Objectives (from proposal): The idea of producing a crystalline alloy with good properties based on a heavy mix of elements was completely new and pushed the boundaries of properties understanding beyond what was known so far from one-and two-element based alloys, leading to the discovery of High Entropy Alloys (HEA). A general lack of experimental data on the crystal structure and local distortions in HEA -all factors considered crucial for the understanding of mechanical properties -emerges from the latest reviews. This project plans to tackle directly some of these aspects: a bcc alloy, so-called Senkov alloy based on Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Hf elements, and its precursors, will be investigated by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The Senkov alloy was chosen because it is the most studied in literature from the mechanical properties point of view, but detailed structural information at the atomic scale are still missing. The results will be then related to i) mechanical properties to be measured on the same compounds and integrated with the literature, and ii) on-going crystal structure investigation on similar hcp-based and fcc-based high entropy alloys. Five different edges Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf and Ta have been measured for reference foils, several reference compounds such as the ternary TiZrHf, TiNbHf, a quaternary MoNbTaW, an hcp based Al15Sc10Ti25Zr25Hf25, and the main compound -also known as Senkov alloy -, TiZrHfNbTa.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Solid Oxide Cells are promising candidates for the creation of smart grid systems that will maintain undisturbed energy flow, especially with a high share of\r\nrenewable sources. The present proposal is dedicated to the structural analysis of the cermet-supported catalysts containing active centres made of metallic\r\nnanoparticles introduced via the conventional wet impregnation route, focusing on the intermetallic synergistic behavior between Ni and secondary metal. The\r\ntransition metals were added into Ni\/YSZ scaffold as a cost-effective alternative to noble metals. The introduction of a secondary promoter metal resulted in\r\naltered electrochemical and catalytic efficiency of the electrochemical devices from the SOCs family, especially when water\/CO2 coelectrolysis mode is applied.The measurements of high-energy X-ray absorption K edges should reveal the relation between the Ni valence, type of secondary metal added, and the oxidation states within new intermetallic phases itself. Bimetallic electrocatalysts for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells -intermetallic synergy and structural alterations  During the measurements at the LISA beamline at the ESRF, materials consisting of the nickel cermet infiltrated with different transition metals were studied. Samples were provided in both oxidized state (marked as OX) and reduced in pure hydrogen at 800\u00b0C (marked as RED). Additionally, some reference materials, such as manganese oxides or Co-containing spinels, were measured as well. Materials were measured in the transmission mode at room temperature. As the amount of infiltrated metals was low (~3 wt.%) when compared to the nickel (~50 wt.%), the absorption signal from the Ni K-edge overwhelmed other materials. In case of the K-edge of elements with atomic number lower than Ni (Z<28), this problem was solved by the cutting off the Ni K-edge energy range, however the signal remained noisier. Unfortunately, for Cu-impregnated cells, the EXAFS signal of Ni K-edge was significantly overlapping with Cu K-edge, which made it impossible to measure Cu edge in transmission mode and because of this reason, for Cu-modified samples, fluorescence mode was applied. Collected data was analysed using the Athena software. Because the Ni spectra were of perfect quality, the Fourier transform was performed to analyse the EXAFS region and to determine the changes in the local surrounding of Ni atoms with respect to different infiltrated metals. FT was not implemented for Cu\/Ni-YSZ samples, as in this case, the Cu K-edge was disturbing the EXAFS spectra of Ni. The XAS spectra for Ni-edge in both oxidized and reduced states are presented in the Fig.  The FT EXAFS signal (with phase correction of 0.5 \u00c5 included) is presented in Fig.  Wide-range XAS spectra of Mn, Fe, and Co are plotted in Fig. ",

    "title":"Unraveling the De-\/Lithiation Mechanism of different (Bismuth-doped) Niobium Oxides via ex situ and operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We aim to elucidate the Li storage mechanism of Nb2O5 when de-\/lithiated in the range of 0.01-3.0 V, which offers almost twice the capacity compared to the common range of 1.0-3.0 V. Interestingly, Bi doping increases the initial capacity even further. Previously, we have performed an ex situ study on Bi-doped and neat orthorhombic Nb2O5 at selected potentials of the 1st and 2nd cycle, and the results show that the storage mechanism is very complex. Since ex situ samples are single data points, the operando measurements are highly complementary. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: (i) Are the ex situ results confirmed by the operando results? (ii) How do the species change in-between the ex situ data points and (iii) what is the exact role of Bi? In addition to the 1st cycle, we will also perform an operando analysis of the 200th cycle. The results will (iv) shed light on the fading mechanisms and are, thus, essential for the further improvement of such materials. Proposer: Giovanni Orazio LEPORE Beamline(s): LISA@ESRF Shift: 18 Achievements: Within this experiment, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted for both non-doped monoclinic and (Bidoped) orthorhombic Nb2O5 in the 1 st and 200 th cycles at either Nb K-edge or Bi LIII-edge, complemented by ex situ measurements for electrodes after 200 cycles. Spectra at the Nb K-edge and Bi LIII-edge were collected in transmission mode, and simultaneously in fluorescence mode for the Bi LIII-edge. A preliminary analysis of the XANES indicates that: i) The local environment of monoclinic Nb2O5 between the 1 st and 200 th cycles is different. ii) The Nb K-edge for orthorhombic (Bi-doped) Nb2O5 exhibits an intense evolution in the local geometry in the first cycle. Nevertheless, its oxidation state reaches the initial state (Nb 5+ ) after a full cycle, which is in agreement with the ex situ XANES data. iii) The spectra at the Bi LIII-edge reveal a reduction from Bi 3+ to metallic bismuth, and then further to LixBi. Upon delithiation, Bi was only partially reoxidized to its metallic form after the first full cycle. During the 200 th cycle, the same behavior was observed, i.e., at 0.01 V, the LixBi alloy is formed and at 3.0 V, metallic Bi 0 was found, but with a bit low oxidation state. Graphite is still the anode material of choice for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity of around 370 mAh g -1 vs. Li + \/Li, low de-\/lilthiation potential, enabling high specific energy at the full cell level. However, the slow kinetics of the lithium intercalation may lead to serious lithium plating during rapid charging, particularly at low temperatures. ",

In the context of high entropy shape-memory alloys related to Ti-Zr-Hf-Co-Ni-Cu-Pd, and its precursors, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will be used to investigate bond distances between selected pair of elements. The structural phase transition between martensite and austenite states will be analyzed, i.e. the fundamental mechanism on which shape-memory-effects are based. Finally, a broader comparison of this system in its austenitic phase will be carried out with data already acquired in previous experiments on hcp-based (Ti-Hf-Zr-Al-Sc) and fcc-based (Al-Cr-Co-Cu-Fe-Ni) systems, for a better understanding of crystal structure properties in HEAs altogether.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Unravelling the lithium storage mechanism of alternative anode materials is critical for the ongoing development of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Previously, we have performed a comprehensive XAS characterization of various metal-doped CeO2 anode materials, in particular Fe-doped CeO2, revealing the atomic scale reduction of the dopant within the host structure. Our results provide information on the oxidation state of the cations upon cycling and on the structural mechanism of dopant incorporation and its effect on the de-\/lithiation mechanism. We aim to extend the reaction mechanism to Ru-doped CeO2. Remarkably, doping CeO2 with 15 at-% Ru provides the highest capacity among all metal-doped CeO2 anodes studied so far. Ex situ & operando XANES spectra are pivotal for elaborating the evolution of valence states and the bonding state of the electroactive species. Longer ex situ EXAFS will reveal the evolution of coordination environment and local structure around Ru and Ce.  Figure ",

    "title":"Crystallization of low-solid oleogels: characterization of lamellar thickness",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Oleogelation is a promising technique in which liquid oil and a low concentration of high-melting crystalline oleogelators are used to replace saturated fats. The rheological properties and oil binding capacity of the resulting oleogels are largely influenced by the fat crystal network. Therefore, it is important to investigate the melting and crystallization behavior of the crystalline oleogelators. In this project, different oleogelator types (waxes, monoglycerides (MAG) and diglycerides (DAG)) will be used. During the production, the gelator concentration and type as well as the shear rate and cooling rate will be adapted to investigate the effect of processing on the formation of the fat crystal network. Simultaneous and time-resolved SAXS\/WAXS analysis will help to gain more insight in nucleation and crystal growth. Hereby, special attention will be given to the lamellar thickness of crystal nanoplatelets.  Crystallization of low-solid oleogels: characterization of lamellar thickness Experiment number: A26-2-951 Beamline: BM26 Date of experiment: from: 22\/11\/2022 to: 25\/11\/2022 Date of report: Shifts: 9 Local contact(s): Martin Rosenthal Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Filip Van Bockstaele -Ghent University, Food Structure and Function Research Group Kato Rondou -Ghent University, Food Structure and Function Research Group Report: Persons who participated in the experiments -Kato Rondou -Fien De Witte -Ivana Penagos All participants are affiliated to Ghent University, Food Structure and Function Research Group. The aim of the research The results obtained with these experiments will contribute to getting a better fundamental understanding in the relation between processing and the microstructure of oleogels (based on monoglycerides and waxes). The strength of using synchtrotron data is that results could be obtained for the oleogels containing only 1% of solids and obtaining time-resolved measurements. Different X-ray techniques are used to characterize the oleogels from nano-to mesoscale. Within this research, the main aim is to further develop methodologies to obtain more information about the size and variability of crystal nanoplatelets and the impact of processing on this (Fig.  Two different setups were used. The oleogels (varying concentration and hardstock) were dynamically produced at Ghent University by applying high cooling rates and high shear rates. To investigate the effect of processing, these oleogels were measured with kaptons without any additional heat treatments. Additionally, the samples were molten (80\u00b0C) and cooled by varying the cooling rate (1 -5 -10 -20 \u00b0C\/min) and final temperature (5 -10 -20 -25\u00b0C) in capillaries to investigate the effect of cooling rate and crystallization temperature. With the experiments performed at BM26, the generated data contributes to elucidate the impact of high shearing rate and cooling rate on the final fat crystal network of low-solids systems. Despite having two problems related to the beam, we were able to perfom almost all our experiments. It was notable that even for some of the samples (not all) with only 1% hardstock a good result was obtained. Additionally, based on the results obtained with the time-resolved measurements, the impact of changing the cooling rate and final temperature can be observed. However, more detailed results are kept confidential to avoid conflicts on publications. It is expected to submit at least one publication containing part of the results obtained with this project. Further research is being executed to obtain complementary data from PLM, DSC, rheology, etc. We want to thank our local contact Martin Rosenthal for all his help during our stay at the ESRF.",

High-performance TPC parts are produced via a rapid stamp-forming process, yielding a complex, transient (non-isothermal) crystallisation environment leading to a distinctly anisotropic crystalline structure. Such variations in structure inevitably lead to local variations in material properties; mapping this inhomogeneity is critical to predicting performance. Particularly, mapping these variations would reveal the local processing history of the material and is critical for the development of accurate process simulation tools. Here, we propose the use of microfocus WAXS to create a detailed map of the crystalline morphology of an industrially-processed polyamide (PA66) laminate material with 60% w.f. glass fibre (PA66-GF60). Thermoplastic composites (TPCs) such as glass fibre reinforced polyamide laminates offer a unique material solution for low-carbon mobility applications, enabling high-volume manufacture of inherently sustainable (recyclable) light-weight components. High-performance TPC parts are produced via a number of techniques including rapid stamp-forming and bladder inflation processes. This yields a complex, transient (nonisothermal) crystallisation environment leading to a distinctly anisotropic crystalline structure in the part. Such variations in structure inevitably lead to local variations in material properties; mapping this inhomogeneity is critical to predicting performance. Mapping these variations can reveal the local processing history of the material and is critical for the development of accurate process simulation tools. Here, we used microfocus WAXS to obtain a map of the crystalline morphology of an industrially-processed polyamide (PA66) braided laminate material with glass fibre (PA66-GF). The material is a comingled polyamide glass braided structure which was consolidated using a recently developed rapid bladder forming process  2D WAXS patterns were taken as the X-ray beam mapped across the sample. Figure  Figure  The results show that good flow of the resin is achieved during the newly developed rapid moulding process. Despite the short processing time a polyamide \uf061 crystal structure arising from the controlled cooling is seen throughout the sample. This shows that despite high process TAKT time needed for automotive part production, a stable component can be produced. Further work is under way to establish if there are localised differences in morphology arising close to the fibre edges that may play a role in part quality.",

    "title":"Coupling of plastic deformation and magnetism in Heusler alloys: an in situ microLaue experiment during compression of micropillars",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Magnetic interactions strongly depend on local order and interatomic distances. Hence mechanical deformation can lead to interesting modifications of magnetic ordering. Recently the group at University of California at Santa Barbara has observed a decrease in net magnetization after plastic deformation of compressed ingots or ground powders of the Heusler alloys MnAu2Al. These experiments have clearly evidenced the role of plastic deformation on magnetic properties in this intermetallic alloy; the converse could also be a potent effect wherein long-range magnetic order could influence the energy landscape for dislocations and their mobility. This raises the interesting question of the impact of long-range magnetic order on plastic properties and dislocation dynamics. This proposal aims at a thorough investigation of the initial stages of plastic deformation in Heusler micropillars using a combination of microcompression and microLaue diffraction. Magnetic ordering is intimately related to local atomic environment (nature and distances of neighboring atoms) and mechanical deformation can lead to a wide range of interesting phenomena. The coupling between mechanics and magnetism is particularly evident in ordered intermetallics that undergo plastic deformation, where dislocations may place atoms on new atomic sites, and therefore create new chemical environments and interatomic distances. In a recent study  Sample preparation is decribed in figure  For in situ microcompression tests, the nanoindenter FT-NMT04 (FemtoTools) [2] equipped with a diamond flat punch was brought by IM2NP group and installed on the goniometer of the BM32 beamline. This was actually the first time this device was installed on BM32 beamline. During compression in displacementcontrolled mode with a displacement rate of 30 nm\/s, Laue microdiffraction patterns were recorded using a sCMOS camera installed at 90\u00b0 with respect to the incident polychromatic X-ray beam. The beam size on the 40\u00b0 inclined sample was 300 nm x 500 nm. Cyclic loading-unloading curves with increasing maximum load were applied to each micropillar until a clear sign of plastic deformation was visible in the load-displacement curve. During compression, in order to prevent any unwanted additional force in the sample under loading time scans at a fixed position on the pillar were acquired. 2D Laue microdiffraction maps were recorded of the micropillars both in their pristine state and after compression. An example of such an experiment is shown in figure  For the first time the FT-NMT04 nanoindenter has been installed successfully on beamline BM32. Twelve single crystal MnCu2Al micro-pillars have been compressed in situ while recording Laue diffraction patterns. A detailed analysis of these patterns (in particular the rotation of the crystal lattice) is underway using the LaueTools software and the LaueTools neural network (newly developed by the BM32 beamline staff). In addition, the compressed pillars are being thoroughly characterized by transmission electron microscopy. This successful experiment opens avenues for continuing using in situ Laue microdiffraction for the investigation of the coupling between plasticity and magnetism in Heusler alloys. In particular, it would be of high interest to investigate the plastic behavior of alloys such as MnCu2Al, which is not ferromagnetic at room temperature.",

    "title":"Transformation-induced plasticity in zirconia-based ceramics: an in situ microLaue experiment\r\nduring compression of micropillars",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Ce-stabilized zirconia (CSTZ) presents very interesting opportunities as a ductile ceramic that does not suffer from low-temperature degradation. It is known that this\r\nductility arises because of martensitic transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) but the microscopic mechanisms at the origin of the onset of the transformation and\r\nthe influence of different factors such as stress magnitude, crystal orientation are still unknown. In this experiment we want to spatially-resolve strain, crystal\r\norientation and phase, and dislocation nature using micro-Laue diffraction on CSTZ micropillars during in situ compression at different levels of plastic strain. The\r\nresults of such an experiment will be very valuable for the understanding of TRIP in CSTZ. The martensitic transformation of 12 mol% ceria-doped tetragonal zirconia micropillars (MPs) was followed by in-situ compression combined with Laue microdiffraction at the BM32 beamline. To perform it, the following proceedings were done ahead of the experiment: First, 12 mol% ceria-doped zirconia pellets were sintered at 1600 \u00baC for 10 hours dwell time. The high temperature and sintering time were used to facilitate the growth of large grains with sizes of up to 8 \u00b5m needed for the subsequent micro-machining of single-crystalline micropillars. Electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD, Symmetry, Oxford Instruments) was performed after cutting the pellets into triangular-shaped pieces, and preparing the surface with low-energy milling (Ilion II, Gatan), reducing surface damage and preventing premature phase transformation. These steps are summarized in Fig.  Figure  During the deformation of ceria stabilized tetragonal zirconia, three deformation behaviors compete with each other: transformation, slip, and fracture. The martensitic transformation is likely to be affected by the crystal orientation 1 . The main criterium of the crystalline orientation of the grains selected for the preparation of the micropillars was the Schmid factor SF. For calculating SF, the tetragonal supercell faces ( ! \" \u2248 1, \ud835\udc434 % \ud835\udc5a2) were used as slip planes. After selecting the grains with crystalline orientations favoring the martensitic transformation, micropillars were milled out of the bulk material using a focused ion beam microscope (FIB, Zeiss NVision 40). In this experiment, two different pillar sizes were tested, one with an aspect ratio (height\/diameter) around 2.5 -3 (\"P\" pillars), and another with an aspect ratio around 4 (\"C\" pillars). The orientation for each P pillar is presented in the inverse pole figure displayed in Fig.  E1 E2 E3 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc39 )*+ P1 45.6 26.3 0.3 0.33 P2 81.9 2.0 47.0 0.08 P3 15.8 88.4 56.4 0.21 P4 142.4 80.1 53.0 0.21 P5 114.6 58.5 5.7 0.37 P6 120.7 138.3 47.0 0.50 P7 35.6 46.2 87.7 0.35 P8 127.5 6.0 82.0 0.08 P9 48.8 48.2 68.6 0.43 P10 5.8 61.3 33.7 0.38 M1 ----M2 175.8 144.8 65.3 0.44 For the other pillar configurations, their orientations are shown here according to their Miller indices in Table  Table  [001] \u2248 0 For in situ microcompression tests, the nanoindenter FT-NMT04 (FemtoTools) equipped with a diamond flat punch was installed on the goniometer of the BM32 beamline. During compression in displacementcontrolled mode with a displacement rate of 30 nm\/s, Laue microdiffraction patterns were recorded using a sCMOS camera installed at 90\u00b0 with respect to the incident polychromatic X-ray beam. Cyclic loadingunloading curves with increasing maximum load were applied to each micropillar until a clear load drop was visible in the load-displacement curve. 2D Laue microdiffraction maps were recorded of the micropillars both in their pristine state and after compression. The Laue microdiffraction patterns were indexed using the LaueTools software and the LaueTools neural network (newly developed by the BM32 beamline staff) which allowed to deduce the monoclinic and tetragonal crystalline phases, the crystalline orientation, and the deviatoric strain for each measurement position within the 2D Laue microdiffraction maps. The calculated maximum stresses obtained from the load-dipalcement curves for all mechanically tested micropillars are shown in Fig.  Due to a slight taper, the diameter of the micropillars increases from the top towards the bottom. The effecive diameter of the deformed zone was calculated\u00b9 using Equation  Where \ud835\udc51 ,2& and \ud835\udc51 32, are the top and bottom diameters of the transformed region, respectively. From Fig.  P1 P2 P6 P8 P10 M2 C1 C2 C3 C4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Maximum Stress (GPa) Figure  In Fig  From these preliminary results, the martensitic transformation was observed even for orientations that were believed to not favor the transformation, where the compression axis \/\/ crystal orientation. Some of the SEM images recorded after mechanical testing show cracks, raising the point of competition between transformation, slip, and fracture. If pillars \"P\" and \"C\" are compared, the latter presented higher maximum stresses. This can be related to the different aspect ratios and different crystalline orientations. In addition, misalignments may also affect the mechanical test, causing sample bending. With this experiment, knowing the corresponding cell variant from the tetragonal\u2192monoclinic transformation is possible, and will aid in understanding how the transformation is preferred for the 12 mol% ceria-doped zirconia. The next steps involve a time-resolved experiment to have a better resolution of when the transformation occurs along the stress-strain curve, and evaluation of by-crystalline micropillars to understand how the transformation propagates between grains. Figure 11 -Pillar P9 pristine and compressed state. Scanning electron microscope images, and laue maps acquired using lauenn are used here to represent the martensitic transformation. A zirconia particle was present during mechanical testing, thus the pillar was still considered undamaged and can be used for further mechanical tests. From the material index map: green = tetragonal; yellow Figure 12 -Pillar P10 pristine and compressed state.

A schematic illustration on the sample preparation steps and the nano-tomography as well as a simulation is shown in Figure  The experiments were carried out at the ID16A nano-imaging beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)  A FReLoN indirect detector system  For the near-field ptychography, the structures of multi-layered coating of the KB optics were used to create a structured beam required for the technique  For the holographic tomography experiments, each sample was scanned at 4 different sampleto-detector distances z2  The reconstruction of the 3D volume of each sample consisted of three steps: i) phase retrieval of each ptychographic scan; ii) pre-processing of each tomographic projection including registration of the misplacement of the sample at each angle; 3) tomographic reconstruction. The phase retrieval was performed using the Python package Ptypy  Afterwards, the resulting images were interpolated back to the initial image size and used as initial guess to the difference map algorithm for 2,000 additional iterations without binning. This was followed by 300 iterations of the maximum likelihood refinement  The reconstruction of the 3D volume consisted of four steps: i) preparation of the image before the phase retrieval; ii) phase retrieval of each holographic scan consisting of image at 4 different sample-to-detector distances; iii) registration of the misplacement of the sample at each angle; iv) tomographic reconstruction. Before the phase retrieval, the average of the 20 dark images was subtracted from the corresponding scan images and empty beam images to take into account the dark noise of the detector. Afterwards, the scan images were divided by the average of the 21 empty beam images to remove the inhomogeneities of the incoming beam. The resulting projections were re-aligned with respect to the known random displacements that were applied during data acquisition. Subsequently, the projections at the four distances were interpolated to reach the pixel size of the images in the first distance. The phase retrieval of the resulting projections with a pixel size of 50 nm was performed using the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) approach  For the inclusion\/grain analysis, the ptychography data-sets were examined on a Windows 10 x64 workstation. The VGDefX-Algorithm from the Porosity\/Inclusion Analysis Module of the software package VGSTUDIO MAX, version 3.1.0. was used. Volumes were imported in 16 bits, resulting in 65,536 different grey levels, where the lower grey levels represent less dense parts and the higher grey levels represent denser parts of the volume. Because of different 16bit normalization value during the image processing, the grey levels of C3S were defined to be in the range of 42,800 to 65,535 (0 h and 20 h) respectively from 49,500 to 65,535 (12 h and 16 h). The resulting sub-volumes were then further analysed by the inclusion detection algorithm \"VGDefX\" with the analysis mode set to \"inclusion\", auto threshold mode \"deviation\", and a deviation factor of -1.00. The analysis area from all of the original volumes was restricted because of a lower signal to noise ratio at the top of the scans. The algorithm produced distinct 3D shapes of C3S, which were further used for the grain size distribution based on the diameter of the grain defined by the diameter of the virtual sphere around the grain. Lower grain size limit was fixed at a minimum volume of 8 voxels. Image stacks reconstructed from the holo-tomographic scans relative to the reference sample and hydrated samples were processed using the freely available software ImageJ  The hydration of tricalcium silicate (Ca 3 SiO 5 , C 3 S in cement notation) has been investigated in a large number of studies to understand the complex reactions that occur during the hydration of ordinary Portland cement  The mechanism of C 3 S hydration is consistently described as a dissolution-precipitation process with precipitation of C-S-H on the surface of C 3 S  Gas adsorption measurements are state-of-the-art for the experimental determination of the specific surface area of anhydrous cementitious materials. Alternatively, the surface area of C 3 S can be calculated from the particle size distribution, usually under the assumption that the particles are spheres without consideration of the particle roughness. Laser scattering is commonly applied to determine the particle size distribution of anhydrous cement\/C 3 S. Because gas adsorption and laser scattering are not phase selective, neither method can be used to measure the C 3 S specific surface area of hydrated samples because these contain anhydrous and hydrous phases (C 3 S, C-S-H and portlandite). Imaging techniques such as electron and X-ray microscopy have high potential in the experimental determination of the particle size distribution and thus the specific surface area of C 3 S during hydration. This is due to the ability of these methods to identify individual particles in the microstructure. High resolution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be used to record 3D images of cementitious materials using focussed ion beam serial sectioning  For high resolution X-ray imaging (2D and 3D), the high brilliance of synchrotron radiation was shown to be advantageous to study multihierarchical materials like cement pastes  In Near-Field Ptychographic X-ray Computed Tomography (NF-PXCT), X-ray absorption and X-ray phase-contrast imaging of the samples are obtained also in the holographic regime. The near-field ptychographic approach is based on the acquisition of holograms of the sample at different lateral positions within a structured incoming coherent beam to solve the ill-posed problem in phase-retrieval  Although the experimental determination of the evolution of the particle size distribution of C 3 S remains a challenging task, hypotheses were proposed to address this important issue. In the first hypothesis, it is assumed that the degree of hydration of the bulk material is equal to that of the median particle size. Based on this assumption, the median particle radius was used to calculate the reacted rim of C 3 S (e), the C-S-H layer thickness (E) and the full particle size (R P , consisting of a C 3 S core overgrown by C-S-H)  The first aim of the present work is to fill the mentioned experimental gaps regarding the measurement of the specific surface area of C 3 S during the main hydration period. Therefore, the C 3 S particle size distribution is measured by state-of-the-art 3D X-ray nanoimaging technology, uniquely available in 3rd generation synchrotron facilities such as ESRF including the novel near-field ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (NF-PXCT) and holographic X-ray computed tomography (HXCT). The present work is thus the first application of NF-PXCT for characterization of cementitious samples. The used techniques provide an unprecedented high sensitivity to sample morphology and unprecedented high resolution to study dynamics in cement. Thereby, the particle size distribution data are obtained from the analysis of local distribution of the particle morphology by measuring each particle individually. The second aim of the present work is to evaluate the 'reaction zone hypothesis' by simulation of the development of the C 3 S particle size distribution during hydration based on the gathered data. The degree of hydration of C 3 S is needed as an input parameter for this purpose, which is independently analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and thermal analysis (TA). Additionally, the C-S-H layer thickness at the C 3 S surface is evaluated by SEM imaging. The latter approach is complicated by the fact that SEM is a 2D-method which is discussed in Section 3.2. The reliability of the 'reaction zone hypothesis' is explored by comparison of the measured and predicted control parameters: C 3 S particle size distribution and specific surface area of C 3 S. The aqueous phase composition is measured by means of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) during the main hydration period. Combination of the various results allows us to discuss the development of the C 3 S particle size distribution during hydration with additional information on the liquid phase composition. Tricalcium silicate was produced by high temperature solid state reaction from a blend of calcium carbonate (Merck p.a.) and highly dispersed silicon dioxide (Merck p.a.). The raw materials were homogenized and fired at 1520 \u2022 C for 8 h in a platinum crucible and subsequently quenched at 20 \u2022 C. This procedure was repeated twice and the material was ground between the high temperature treatments to improve its homogeneity. For high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography, the volume of the sample has to be very small. To guarantee that a sufficient number of particles are in that volume, the particle size of the C 3 S has to be below 10 \u03bcm. For this purpose, the material was ground in batches of 25 g for 20 min in a zirconia disk mill at 700 rpm under the addition of 0.08 g diethylene glycol as a grinding aid. The particle size was further reduced in an air classifier to remove particles larger than 10 \u03bcm. The individual batches of C 3 S were finally homogenized. The particle size distribution measured by Laser scattering is provided in the supplementary information (Fig.  The C 3 S produced in this study has the following chemical composition (determined by chemical wet analysis based on titration of calcium, gravimetric determination of silicon and ICP-OES analysis for all other elements): 72.8 wt.-% CaO, 26.1 wt.-% SiO 2 and 1.0 wt.-% LOI, whereas the concentration of foreign oxides was below the limit of detection (0.1 wt.-%). The free lime concentration determined by Franke-method  All experiments were designed to match the requirements of synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. As stated before, particle sizes below 10 \u03bcm are specifically prepared in order to increase the spatial resolution of the tomography. Therefore, a relatively high water\/C 3 S-ratio (by mass) of 3.0 was required to produce a workable suspension as the surface area of the starting material is very high. This water\/solid-ratio is higher than normally used for hydration studies on pastes but it was recently confirmed that hydration kinetics of C 3 S are not affected by the water\/solid-ratio above 0.5  The closed vessel filled with the suspension was stirred for 24 h at a temperature of 25 \u2022 C. Samples (approx. 6 mL suspension) taken after 4, 8, 12, and 16 h of hydration were filtered in a gaseous nitrogen pressure filtration unit using filters with a pore width of 15 nm. This relatively small pore width of the filter was used to avoid C-S-H particles from passing through the filter, especially when superplasticizers are present  Sample preparation for SEM characterization included embedding of the hydrated samples in epoxy resin and mechanical polishing using diamond slurries of 15, 9, 3, and 1 \u03bcm particle size. The polished samples were coated with gold to ensure electric conductivity of the sample surface. The samples for synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography were produced by embedding the samples in a commercial two-component epoxy resin. Thin filaments composed of epoxy resin and sample material were pulled while the epoxy-C 3 S mix was already stiff but still workable. After hardening of these filaments containing the samples embedded in epoxy resin, these were cut into small segments with a length of 1-2 mm. Segments with a diameter of approximately 100 \u03bcm were selected under an optical microscope and glued to the sample post of the device by epoxy resin. Thus, the final length of the filaments was approximately 1 mm and the diameter was approximately 100 \u03bcm. Only the anhydrous C 3 S was mixed with a highly adsorbing polymer before embedding in resin as described before. This was done to produce an organic film on the surface that enables the observation of individual C 3 S particles instead of agglomerates. For this purpose, 1.00 g C 3 S was mixed with 2.00 g polymer dispersion (styrene-acrylate co-polymer model latex in  XRD patterns of the hydrated samples were obtained in a D8 Advance diffractometer (BRUKER-AXS) equipped with a LynxEye detector using a Cu-tube operating at 40 mA and 40 kV. The scans from 7 to 70 \u2022 2\u03b8 were recorded with a step size of 0.011 \u2022 2\u03b8 and a counting time of 0.5 s per step. The concentration of individual phases was calculated using the Rietveld-software Topas 5.0 (BRUKER-AXS), using a recently developed external standard method  Thermogravimetry data were obtained in a TA instruments SDT Q600 device at a heating rate of 10 K\/min under a stream of nitrogen. The water content of C-S-H was determined by subtraction of the change in mass related to dehydration of portlandite and the decarbonation of calcium carbonate from the loss on ignition at the final temperature (1000 \u2022 C). It was revealed in this calculation that the C-S-H of the hydrated C 3 S sample contains 2.6 mol of water. Under the assumption of a Ca\/Si molar ratio of 1.7 for C-S-H, the hydration reaction of C 3 S can be written as: Eq. (  Single-pulse and cross-polarization ( 29 Si{ 1 H} CP) experiments were conducted by 29 Si solid-state NMR to quantify the concentrations of C 3 S, C-S-H and metastable hydrate phase  The 29 Si{ 1 H} CP experiments were conducted using parameters that were adjusted using a sample of \u03b1-C 2 SH at the same MAS frequency of 4 kHz. The spectra were recorded using an initial 1 H pulse (\u03c0\/2 pulse length of 4.5 \u03bcs), a contact time of 4 ms with a 1 H rf field strength of 38.3 kHz (ramp 10090) and a 29 Si rf field strength of 30.9 kHz, 1 H decoupling during acquisition for 10 ms, a recycle delay time of 3 s and 1024 scans. The concentration of C 3 S, C-S-H, and a metastable hydration product containing Q 0 sites was computed from the (corrected) relative intensities from the deconvolution of the spectra, the silicon concentration in the sample and the molar weight of the phases. The molar weight of C-S-H and the metastable hydration product is based on the composition of these phases assuming 1.7 CaO  All chemical shift data are reported relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an external standard. The software DMFit was used for the deconvolution of the spectra  The 29 Si{ 1 H} MAS NMR (CP) spectra and the chemical shifts of the phases are presented in the supplementary information of this article (Fig.  Ion concentrations in the filtered aqueous solutions were analysed by ICP-OES using a Horiba Jobin Yvon, active M with radial observation. Calcium and silicon concentrations were measured at a wavelength of 373.69 nm and 251.61 nm, respectively. The aqueous phase was obtained by filtration of the suspensions after 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 16 h of hydration. The filtered solutions were diluted and stabilized by the addition of 0.2 g of 5 M HNO 3 for analysis by means of ICP-OES. This dilution was taken into account. Microstructural characterization was carried out using a SEM equipped with a field emission gun (Nova NanoSEM 230 FEI). For the detection of backscatter electron images, 12 kV acceleration voltage and 1.8 nA probe current were used (high vacuum mode of the instrument). The C-S-H layer thickness was measured by manually selecting undisturbed (by sample preparation and vacuum) hydration rims. For each sample more than 50 particles have been analysed. It is known that C-S-H can lose water when exposed to high vacuum but it is not expected that the morphology is significantly affected by this dehydration (measurements were taken in areas where no significant shrinkage cracking was observed). The experiments were carried out at the ID16A nano-imaging beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF)  The samples obtained during the hydration experiment were analysed by three independent methods to determine the degree of hydration. These include QXRD, 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. The degree of hydration is calculated from the evolution of the concentration of tricalcium silicate in the samples when using QXRD and 29 Si NMR. In contrast, the C 3 S concentration is indirectly assessed by thermal analysis by using the determined concentrations of C-S-H and portlandite to stoichiometrically calculate the C 3 S concentration (Eq. (  (2): A corrected R 2 = 0.99955 was achieved with the fit parameters A1 = 97.6 wt.-%, A2 = 19.5 wt.-%, t0 = 12.9 h and dt =2.1 h. This mathematical fit is also given in Fig.  As shown in Fig.  In addition to the C 3 S concentration, the aqueous phase of the C 3 S suspensions during hydration was analysed by ICP-OES (Table  The hydrated samples were investigated by SEM with the aim of evaluating the C 3 S particle size distribution and the C-S-H layer thickness at the surface of the C 3 S particles during hydration.

Fig.  The image processing from the NF-PXCT experiments is exemplarily shown in Fig.  In the following, the identified C 3 S particles were converted into particle size distributions. The volume distributions of the anhydrous C 3 S particles are shown in Fig.  Fig.  Results in Fig.  A hydration time dependent particle size distribution measurement during C 3 S hydration with full phase selectivity was achieved in this study by employing synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. As mentioned in the introduction, this experimental data was unavailable up to now for a description of the C 3 S hydration. The obtained data on the development of the particle size distribution are used to evaluate the 'reaction zone hypothesis'. This hypothesis claims that the hydration proceeds in an identical reacted depth (rim) for all sizes of particles (Fig.  With the reacted rim thickness e (Fig.  From D i (\u03b1), the mass of particle of class i(m i ) can be calculated using the corresponding volume of a sphere and the mass density of C 3 S (3.16 g\/cm 3 ). The degree of hydration of particle of class i at time t, \u03b1 i (t), reads: With m i (t) and m i,0 being the mass of the particle i at time t and at time zero, respectively. The sum over all particles classes i weighted by the number of particles in each class N i of the initial bulk sample gives the degree of hydration of the bulk sample \u03b1(t): During simulation, the reacted rim thickness e is iterated until the global degree of hydration of the particles matches the measured degree of hydration at time t of the bulk sample (\u03b1(t), Eq. (  For the following simulation, the measured particle size distribution (NF-PXCT only) of the reference sample and the degree of hydration of the bulk samples are used as input parameters. Fig.  The simulation in Fig.  The degree of hydration of particles with diameter ranging from 0.40 \u03bcm to 6.31 \u03bcm decreases from 1.0 to 0.2 non-linearly. After 16 h of hydration, particles smaller than 0.98 \u03bcm have completely reacted and after 20 h this value is 1.22 \u03bcm. The simulated values for the distribution of the degree of hydration over the initial particle sizes (Fig.  The 'reaction zone hypothesis' is qualitatively evaluated by comparing the measured values of the C-S-H layer thickness and the particle size distribution in the following. A quantitative evaluation will be presented afterwards by the comparison of the measured and predicted specific surface area of C 3 S during hydration. The qualitative evaluation step regarding the simulation based on the 'reaction zone hypothesis' centres around the comparison of the predicted and measured particle size distribution of C 3 S during hydration. In addition to the particle size distribution of the starting material (measured by NF-PXCT), also the degree of hydration of the samples is taken into account as an input parameter. From this, the volume fractions of C 3 S in the size classes i can be calculated for the hydrated samples. The results of this calculation are compared to the measured values in Fig.  The results from the simulation and nano-tomography are displayed in Fig.  It is evident from Fig.  It is important to point out that the simulation data obtained from the shrinking core model closely agrees with the experimental data thus confirming the validity of that model -at least for the samples analysed in this study. The qualitative evaluation of the 'reaction zone hypothesis' shown in Section 4.3.1 is now followed by quantitative tests by analysing the surface area of C 3 S during hydration (Table  The surface area data in Table  In view of the quantitative comparison in Table  The reaction zone hypothesis was applied here for the computation of C 3 S layer dissolved during hydration and showed good agreement with the experimental data for the evolution of the C 3 S particle size distribution during hydration. In addition to this, the reaction zone hypothesis can be applied to the thickness of the C-S-H layer formed around the C 3 S particles during hydration as originally proposed  The present study focuses on the measurement of the time-dependent C 3 S particle size distribution during the main hydration period of C 3 S. Since the C 3 S particles are overgrown by C-S-H, phase selective synchrotron radiation nano-tomography was applied for the first time to cementitious materials by combining two different operation modes (HXCT and NF-PXCT). The obtained volume distribution of C 3 S particles shows good accordance between HXCT and NF-PXCT results. The experimental data indicate that the C 3 S particles sizes decrease during hydration, which leads to a decrease of the specific surface area of C 3 S due to the consumption of small particles. The obtained experimental results are used to simulate the process of C 3 S dissolution during hydration using a constant reacted rim thickness for all C 3 S particle sizes that varies with the degree of hydration ('reaction zone hypothesis' ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"In this experiment we plan to collect T-variable x-ray diffraction and PDF on a series of tin-based metal halide perovskite. Performing this experiment will be particularly important to access the average  andlocal structure of tin-based  halide  perovskite  of  relevance  for  photovoltaics  applications.  We  expect  to  clarify  the  structural stability and the sequence of phase transitions and make a correlation between average and local structures and compare these results to those already obtained by our group on the lead-based analogue materials. Experiment title: Probing average and local structure in tin halide perovskites Experiment number: CH-5879 Beamline: ID11 Date of experiment: from: 04\/05\/2021 to: 07\/05\/2021 Date of report: 23\/02\/2022 Shifts: 6 Local contact(s): Eleanor Lawrence Bright Carlotta Giacobbe Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Rossella Chiara Mauro Coduri* Lorenzo Malavasi Marta Morana* Department of Chemistry, University of Pavia, Italy Report: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are intereseting materials for their manifold applications, from photovoltaics to photocatalysis. These compounds have general formula ABX3 where A is a small organic cation, such as methilammonium=CH3NH3 + (MA) and formamidinium=HC(NH2) + 2 (FA), or Cs; B is usually Pb, Sn or Ge, and X is a halide, like I, Br or Cl. Whereas the average structure and optical properties of MHP have been thoroughly characterized, their local structure has been only partially explored, despite its influence on the functional properties  X-ray PDF data were collected the material science ID11 beamline (exp number CH5879), at incident wavelength at incident wavelength 0.158135 \u00c5 , using a Dectris Eiger2 X CdTe 4M detector placed 125 mm away from the sample. The distance was calibrated against a CeO2 standard using the pyFAI package, which was used also to integrate the 2D images  Rietveld refinement to assess the quality of the samples was performed using the software Topas  In the etire teperature range the data suggest a trend of incresing distortion with tincreasing the size of the cation, from MA to FA, and the hardeness of the anion. As a consequence, the bromide compositions show a larger distortion than the iodide counterparts. In the PDF data, the distortion appears as asymmetry and broadening in the peaks related to the Sn-X and X-X distances. The observed effects agree with the hypothesis that these compounds are subject to a dynamic off-centering of the B cation that is thermally activated and thus enhanced by temperature5. In order to understand the underlying distortion in the local structure of these materials different models were tested against the room temperature data (RT) to allow for octahedral titling and octahedral distortion. For all the studied materials the local structure was found to be of lower symmetry with respect to the average one, which is cubic. The iodide compounds were well descbide by a rhombhedral model, wherease the bromide ones needed an orthorombic distorsion. A similar trend is also present at low temperature and a similar approach was applied to describe the local structure. Whilst the bromide compounds show large distorstion and are descbribed by an orthorohmbic model, the iodide ones are consistent with a tetragonal model. The distortion is larger at low temperature and for the bromide compounds, whereas at room and higher temperature the local structure of tin iodide compounds seems to be more affected by off-centering of B site cation due to the larger activity of the lone pair with respect to lead analogs ",

    "title":"Phase diagram and local structure of Gd2(Zr1-xTix)2O7 and (Gd1-yNdy)2(Zr1-zCez)2O7 pyrochlore matrices for nuclear waste disposal",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Aim of this proposal is to to map the crystallographic structure at different scale lengths of the following pyrochlore systems: A) Gd2(Zr1-xTix)2O7 solid solutions, which are promising compositions as matrices for the immobilization of actinides, and B) single and double doped (Gd1-yNdy)2(Zr1-zCez)2O7 compounds, to simulate the actinides immobilization (Nd3+ and Ce4+ are used as surrogates for incorporated Am3+ and Pu4+, respectively).\r\nTo this purpose, high-resolution diffraction data will be analyzed using both the Rietveld method and the pair distribution function (PDF) analysis.\r\nThe final goal is to map exhaustively the disorder introduced by doping (that is varying x, y and z in the compounds formula) paving the way to the use of these pyrochlore materials for actinides immobilization. Owing to its radiation resistance, Gd2Zr2O7 is a potential matrix for incorporating radionuclides. In experiments simulating the \u03b1-decay of embedded radionuclides with ion beam irradiation, it has been demonstrated that the susceptibility to radiation-induced amorphization in the system Gd2(Zr1-xTix)2O7 steadily decreases with increasing Zrcontent. When irradiated, the structure of Zr-rich compounds dissipates the radiation energy undergoing a phase transition from the pyrochlore to the defect fluorite structure  Pyrochlore samples of composition: Gd2(Zr1-xTix)2O7 (x=0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.85, 1) and (Gd1-yNdy)2(Zr1-zCez)2O7 with all the possible combinations of y, z = 0.00, 0.25 and 0.50 were prepared by solid-state reaction, firing the pelletized mixture of starting oxide at 1500 \u00b0C for 24h for several times (5-7) with intermediate grindings and re-pelletizing until a homogeneous material was obtained. XRPD patterns were collected at the ID22 beamline on powdered samples at RT and 90 K using the high-resolution setup of ID22 (\u03bb = 0.35417647 \u00c5) for Rietveld refinements and the 2-D detector (\u03bb = 0.17712028 \u00c5) for PDF analysis We will present here and discuss only results from data collected at 90 K since the RT ones show similar trends. Moreover, we will skip the data on double doped samples because the analysis of their complex behaviour at the local scale is still in progress. In Figure  Both single doped and the double doped systems deserve to be more deeply investigated, completing the analysis of their phase diagrams at different length scales for several reasons: a) they are interesting per se due to their complex behaviour varying the compositional coordinates; b) radiation damage of Gd2Zr2O7 brings to progressive transformation of the average structure from the pyrochlore to the fluorite structure; thus moving along the y coordinate in Gd2(Zr1-yCey)2O7 should mime the same effect; c) since Nd doping of Gd2Zr2O7 contributes to reduce disorder, a full understanding of its role in single and double doped samples should allow to plan Am and\/or Pu doped Gd2Zr2O7 samples for nuclear waste disposal with enhanced resistance to radiation damage. The combined use of HR-XRPD and PDF analysis has proved to be an effective way to address these problems and accurately maps the structures at different length scales. Also EXAFS measurements would play an important and complementary role in mapping the cations environments. In fact, in these very symmetric multi-element systems, coordination shells (1 st -M-O, 2 nd -M-M\u2026) of different cations drop at similar interatomic distances. EXAFS would complete the PDF analysis supplying unique element-sensitive information on cations environments at the very local scale.",

Ce K-edge is chosen instead of Ce LIII-edge, because the EXAFS k-range at the latter is limited by Ce LII edge. The sample was hosted in the DRIFTS cell in the powder form, and its mass was optimized to obtain the best S\/N ratio for XAS measurements. Sample was desolvated in He flow in situ, heating from RT to 423 K, cool back to RT and then dose the adsorptives (CO2 and CD3CN, separately in two different experiments) gradually increasing the partial pressure of the adsorptive in the gas feed. Acetonitrile, being strongly adsorbed, was desorbed by means of a programmed heating ramp. Long EXAFS were at each pressure point during the adsorption experiments (around 15 points for each adsorptive). Water desorption and the uptake of the adsorptives were monitored by mass spectrometer connected to the gas outlet of the cell. Results and discussion: XAS data allowed us to refine the position of the atoms neighbouring Ce: water or carbon dioxide. Their distances were refind by the means of EXAFS fitting (see Figure ",

    "title":"Mapping formation conditions and phase relations of hydrogen-rich phases in the ternary systems A-Si-H (A = Na, Li)",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Recently it has been shown that hydrogenation reactions at 4 - 10 GPa afford unique all-hydrido hypervalent [SiH6]2- complexes in the crystalline hydridosilicates A2SiH6 (A = K, Rb). This suggests that a broader diversity of anionic hypervalent silicon hydride species should be attainable. Their bonding properties closely relate to those of the recently discovered superconducting phases PH2 and H3S. The latter shows a record high Tc of 203 K. However, these binary phases can only be observed at ultrahigh pressures >100 GPa. At the same time, switching to ternary systems can lower the synthesis pressures down to several GPa. We propose to perform in situ studies of reactions AH+Si+H2 (A = Li, Na) at pressures around 9 GPa and in a temperature range 300 \u2013 700 \u00b0C, using ID06-LVP, ESRF. The aim is to exploit the well-controlled p,T environment in LVP experiments to unfold formation conditions and phase relations of new ternary A-Si-H hydrides containing novel hypervalent Si-H species. Sample preparation for CH-5986 was performed in advance at DESY and handled entirely in an Ar-filled glovebox due to air and moisture sensitivity of the starting materials. Powders of alkali metal hydrides (LiH, NaH) and silicon were mixed in either 1:1 or 2:1 AH:Si molar ratio and pressed into pellets of ~2 mm OD, 1 mm height. Along with two pellets of ammonia borane hydrogen source (NH3BH3) the samples were enclosed into sodium chloride (NaCl) capsules of 3 mm OD, ~3.5 mm height. The amount of NH3BH3 per sample corresponded to \u22658 \u00d7 molar excess of hydrogen with respect to Si, while the complete decomposition of the hydrogen source at target pressures was expected at ~300 \u00b0C.  During 15 shifts allocated for CH-5986 a total of 6 experiments were performed: 3 runs were dedicated to each A-Si-H system with both 2:1 and 1:1 AH:Si compositions being examined. Five of the experiments were run successfully, while one terminated in a blowout during heating. Exact reason for the blowout was not clear, but possibly related to a collapse of the X-ray transparent gasket insertion. In case of Na-Si-H system samples employing 2NaH:1Si molar ratio were first studied at starting pressure of 9 GPa (Fig.  Overall, during CH-5986 we have observed a formation of at least one novel ternary phase in proposed A-Si-H systems (A=Na, Li). We plan to extend studies of these systems using binary A-Si Zintl phases (instead of AH-Si mixtures) as more reactive precursors to unlock other theoretically predicted metastable ternary phases as well as to improve their formation kintetics. Further experiments at ID06-LVP would be extremely beneficial for this project. First publication based on CH-5986 results is currently being prepared. a) b)",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"In situ XAS and VtC-XES experiments will be performed under electrocatalytic conditions for a dimeric copper-pyalc complex to unravel the mechanistic pathways of the Cu-complex for efficient water oxidation. This proposal aims to provide for the first time experimental understanding into the electrochemically generated in situ active catalytic species for water oxidation in a dinuclear Cu(pyalc) complex under real operando conditions. To this end, we propose the realization of in situ HERFD-XANES, EXAFS, VtC-XES experiments on our newly discovered Cu(pyalc) complex under bulk electrolysis condition. This study offers an excellent opportunity to directly monitor surface structure-transformations, evolution of the local-coordination, metal ligand interactions, changes in the electronic states and Cu valence state. These results will offer new insight into the mechanistic pathways in dimeric Cu-complexes for the design of efficient water oxidation catalysts. The in-situ HERFD-XANES & VtC-XES experiments under chronoamperometric conditions were performed at the ID26 beamline. Ex-situ measurements were carried out on Cu reference samples pressed into pellets. For all in-situ measurements, a in-house bulit in-situ electrocatalysis flow-cell with kapton windows was used (Fig.  Analysis of the Cu references samples indicated the presence of major and minor pre-edge peaks for Cu(II) and Cu(III) valence states. In addition, the Cu(III) pre-edge is shifted by 1.79 eV to higher energies as compared with Cu(II) (Fig.  The combined in-situ data from HERFD-XANES and VtC-XES suggest that water oxidation turnover includes a formal Cu(III) species. The pre-edge intensification and oxy ligand contribution supports the above hypothesis. Further correlations are to be drwan from DFT calculations and simulations so as to completely confirm the optimized geometry and electronic states of the active species. The experiemntal data clearly suggest the presence of a high valent Cu intermediate.

    "title":"Combined scattering contrast imaging of catalyst pellets under operando conditions to understand Mn promotion in Co\/TiO2 Fischer Tropsch cat",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"A study of a series of Mn-doped, TiO2-supported Co Fischer-Tropsch catalysts have shown surprising selectivity towards alcohols. Previous XRD-CT experiments conducted provided some insight into the progression of the cobalt phases during reduction and reaction at various doping levels, however the Mn phases were not observable due to their high dispersion. Observing these catalysts under operando conditions (Fischer-Tropsch reaction at 20 bar gas (barg)) via combined \u03bc-XRD-CT\/\u03bc-PDF-CT with a spatial resolution ~ 1 \u03bcm will provide valuable understanding into the Mn (and Co) species present during catalysis, and so provide insight into the cause of the observed selectivity changes. 10 %Co\/TiO2 extruded trilobe pellets (radius ~ 1 mm) with varied Mn loadings (0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5% and 10%) were activated at 300\u00b0 C and in 100% H2 at BP facilities. An additional 10% Mn sample was activated at 450\u00b0 C. They were then reacted in FT conditions for 300 hrs. Conversion and selectivity were measured during the reaction. The reactor was an 8-channel high throughput unit, with common gas feeds, pressures but individual liner temperature control. 1ml of catalyst was loaded into each liner ahead of leak testing, activation and FT synthesis. The extrudates were unloaded from the reactor without removing their wax coating as a self-passivating procedure, using only a short nitrogen purge step. Samples (0%, 3% and 5% Mn) were also reacted for 150 hrs in FT conditions and recovered for analysis, using an analogous 4-channel reactor  The pellets were mounted in glass capillaries (3 mm diameter and 0.1 mm wall thickness) and secured with quartz wool. The \u00b5-XRD-CT and \u00b5-PDF-CT scans of the extrudates were performed at ESRF, ID31. A picture of the experimental set-up is presented in Figure  After calibration of every 2D diffraction image, pyFAI software  TOPAS was used to perform Rietveld analysis on the XRD-CT data for quantitative phase analysis and structure determination. Initially, the CeO2 standard was refined to find the instrumental parameters which were then fixed in the subsequent refinements. The Rietveld analysis was initially performed on the summed diffraction pattern of the entire XRD-CT data in order to arrive at a suitable starting model for subsequent sequential refinement of all the data. Scale factors were refined for each phase initially followed by lattice parameters and then crystallite size and strain parameters. Firstly, the known dominant phases, rutile and anatase, in the catalyst phase were included and refined in the input file. Next, cobalt metal phases (FCC and HCP) and cobalt carbide were refined. Due to the similar X-ray scattering effects coefficients of Mn and cobalt, cobalt and Mn oxides could not be refined separately. It is known that mixed metal oxide spinels form  The atomic pair distribution function (PDF) was produced by Fourier transforming the XRD-CT data using PDFGetX3 software  Low wt % of CoO was present in the higher Mn loading samples (5% and 10% Mn). Note that no reflections due to the anatase TiO2 polymorph are present in this portion of the diffraction pattern. The mean XRD-CT refined patterns for the samples are illustrated in Figure  The XRD-CT spatial maps presented in Figure  It was found that the FCC crystallite size decreases with increasing Mn loading as seen in Error! Reference source not found. which corresponds to previous research  The summed PDF patterns were produced by summing all the Bragg data for each pixel and then Fourier transforming the result. Similar to the XRD refinement, an increase in Mn loading resulted in increased Co2C formation, first appearing at 3 wt % Mn, whilst Co 0 (FCC and HCP) phases were present at lower Mn loadings (0% and 1%). There was a higher percentage of FCC\/HCP cobalt detected in the PDF than in the XRD indicating the presence of small cobalt metal particles. A larger percentage of CoO is detected at higher Mn wt % indicating that the Mn was present in disordered or small mixed-oxide spinels (Co1Mn1-xO) particles that could not be detected by XRD. The refinement of the mean patterns from 0-10 \u00c5 is presented in Figure  The results from the PDF-CT refinement correlated with the results from the XRD-CT refinement where an increasing Mn loading was found to lead to an increase in Co2C formation on the extrudate periphery and decreasing Co 0 (FCC and HCP) content in the centre. The PDF-CT wt % maps are presented in Figure  The Rwp is multiplied by a factor of one third in the maps in order to visually identify any abnormalities and correlation. It is found that the error is uniform throughout at around 30 %. The errors in real-space PDF refinements are usually higher than those in XRD and this Rwp value is tolerable and indicates a reasonable fit.  Catalyst stability was investigated throughout the reaction and the results for the 2% Mn catalyst are presented in Figure  \u00b5-XRD-CT and \u00b5-PDF-CT techniques were used as complementary techniques to study Co\/TiO2\/Mn FT catalyst where it was found that increasing Mn loading corresponded to increasing cobalt carbide content and decreasing cobalt metal (FCC and HCP) in passivated catalyst recovered after reaction. It was found that the cobalt carbide was located on the periphery of the catalytic extrudates whilst the cobalt metal phases (FCC and HCP) were at the centre. This could be due to a higher partial pressure of CO at the periphery due to pore diffusion limitations of the syngas. It has been found that Co2C is formed inversely proportionally to the H2\/CO ratio  Recovering and imaging the catalyst after 300 hrs of reaction provided an insight into the catalytic structure during industrially relevant conditions and timescales. This enabled the study of the formation of the cobalt carbide phase as a function of Mn loading with spatial resolution by using XRD-CT and PDF-CT chemical imaging techniques. -Analysis of the presence of stacking faults in the Co\/TiO2\/Mn catalyst. -Investiating the role of Mn in the formation of Co2C in the catalytic systems. -The use of different supports and the formation of carbides with alcohol\/olefin selectivity. -Formation of carbides with different syngas ratios during reduction and reaction.",

    "title":"Unveiling the CO2 adsorption sites in the triangular channels of Fe2(BDPNH2) metal-organic framework by in situ HR-PXRD",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The experiment proposed hereafter is meant to get structural understanding of CO2 adsorption by the novel amino-tagged metal-organic framework (MOF) Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 [H2BDP-NH2 = 2-amino-1,4-bis(pyrazol-4-yl)benzene], taking advantage of in situ high resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) at different temperatures and CO2 loadings. HR-PXRD has been already exploited (ID22) with the known isomorphous Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4-bis(pyrazol-4-yl)benzene] [1], unveiling the CO2\/framework interactions. The same experiment on Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 will enable us to unveil its CO2 adsorption sites and host-guest interactions, thus disclosing the role of the NH2-function in the adsorption process. Also through a comparison with the HR-PXRD results obtained on Fe2(BDP)3, this experiment will allow a deeper understanding of the improved CO2 separation properties we observed after amino functionalization.[2] This will also open the way to the design and synthesis of improved, new generation adsorbents. The primary CO2 adsorption sites were located by means of the Simulated Annealing approach and then refined through the Rietveld method. Comparing the HR-PXRD data of Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 upon CO2 adsorption, neither loss of crystallinity, nor amorphization or phase transition were observed in the studied range of temperatures and pressures. A preliminary whole powder pattern refinement showed a first unit cell volume contraction in the CO2 pressure range 0-1 bar, followed by a slight expansion (\uf044V < 1%), both related to CO2 loading. In order to localise and quantify the adsorbed CO2, assessment of the guest position and orientation followed by Rietveld refinement is currently in progress. To now it can be show that three primary adsorption sites with different occupancy were invariably identified, irrespective of the essayed conditions. Interestingly, both at 273 and 298 K, the applied CO2 pressure affects the degree of positional disorder featured by the central phenyl ring of one of the two independent ligands and of the amino groups interacting with the CO2 molecules. The amount of CO2 adsorbed increases applying higher pressures and it is inversely proportional to the adsorption temperature. Monte Carlo simulations are currently in progress to further strengthen the correctness of the experimental findings. Our structural insight will provide key information to shed light on the chemical and structural properties a host should possess for efficient CO2 adsorption and separation at rather mild conditions.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to use X-ray emission spectroscopy to investigate the charge compensation mechanisms in KV1-y(VO)y(PO4)F1-y positive electrode materials for K-ion batteries in operando and ex situ conditions. We expect to obtain unambiguous information on the evolution of V oxidation state and the impact of the vanadyl type \u201cdefects\u201d (V=O) on the redox processes upon K+ extraction\/intercalation. Finally, by comparing operando HERFD-XAS spectra with our previous XAS ones, we will provide a more accurate description of the electronic rearrangement of KV1-y(VO)y(PO4)F1-y positive electrodes upon cycling. This study will pave the way for future investigation on battery materials, where the average description of electronic structure is often insufficient to thoroughly understand the impact of the reaction mechanisms on the electrochemical properties, such as voltage fade, hysteresis, and life span.  Among the positive electrode materials developed up to now for K-ion batteries (KIB), layered oxides have been proposed as active materials due to their ability of reversibly inserting alkali ions.  connected through PO4 tetrahedra and forming tunnels for the diffusion of K + ions. The V oxidation state and its local environment in KVPO4F1-xOx (x= 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) have been recently investigated by ex situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. While the V mean oxidation state of the pristine compounds agrees with those obtained by XPS, the presence of V 2+ was not detected by XAS.  The CtC-K\u03b1 lines, which arise from fluorescence after a 2p electron fills a 1s core hole, are the lowest energy emission lines. The 2p spin-orbit coupling causes the K\u03b1 line to split into two components: K\u03b11 (K-L3, 2p3\/2 \u2192 1s) and K\u03b12 (K-L 2 , 2p 1\/2 \u21921s). CtC-K\u03b1 emission lines showed a shift to lower emission energy as the oxidation state increased as a function of the O content of the pristine materials. This was observed at the K\u03b11 line of the CtC-K\u03b1 emission, and the intensity of the K\u03b12 line decreased with increasing oxidation (Fig.  The results of the CtC-K\u03b1 and CtC-K\u03b2 emission lines show different sensitivities. The CtC-K\u03b1 emission line appears to be sensitive to the local structure of the material, similar to conventional XAS measurements. Meanwhile, the CtC-K\u03b2 results suggest sensitivity to both the local geometry and may be use to distinguish the differences in ligands, due to 3p-3d electron exchange interactions. We aim to perform further analysis through ab initio and first principle caculations to understand the emission spectra obtained. We ultimately aim to disentangle the different factors affecting the spectral signatures and to relate these factors to the electronic properties, which affects the electrochemical properties of these materials. Several challenges were encountered during the experiment, including difficulties in measuring the valence-tocore (VtC) K\u03b2 emission lines due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Despite this setback, the collected data will still be used for alternative analysis. Another issue encountered was the measurement of ex situ materials, which were susceptible to oxidation, hindering the planned investigation into the charge compensation mechanism of KVPO4F at different states of charge. The emission spectra did not show significant changes. To overcome these issues in future experiments, it is recommended to adopt better material handling techniques to avoid oxidation and damage to delicate samples. Additionally, an attempt was made to perform operando measurements for KVPO4F, however, frequent beam dumps during battery operation forced the measurements to be stopped.",

    "title":"Structure, redox and luminecence properties of hexanuclear Ce\/Zr clusters in new bimetallic MOFs with various connectivities",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Structure and exact stoichiometry of the hexanuclear {CexZr6-xO4(OH)4} cornerstones in a series of novel bimetallic Ce\/Zr MOFs with different linkers and Ce\/Zr ratios will be determined by Ce and Zr K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy. Ce L3-edge XANES spectroscopy will be used to correlate reducibility of Ce centers with Ce content, connectivity of the framework and their luminescence properties for molecular sensing. Due to their unique properties metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) remain the object of intense studies and a huge number of new materials with different structures and properties are reported every year. MOFs based on the 12 fold (12-c) connected hexanuclear {Zr6O4(OH)4} cornerstones, e.g. UiO-66, are known for their thermal stability and high surface area. Catalytic and sensing properties of these materials can be improved by introducing redox-active Ce(IV) ions and synthesizing MOFs with low cluster connectivity. Synthesis of MOFs have been carried out mainly through solvothermal techniques where water and\/or DMF is used as a solvent to react the Ce containing salt to the linker molecules to yield the MOF. In such conditions it is quite common to observe an in situ reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III)  A series of reactions involving acetonitrile solutions of CAN (Cerium(IV) Ammonium Nitrate) and various dicarboxylic acid linkers (see Figure  The results obtained during the beamtime confirmed that Ce(IV) centers do reduce to Ce(III), as shown by the shift of the absorption edge towards low energies, during the solvothermal reaction before reacting further with the linker to precipitate the MOF crystals. The kinetics of the reduction process are generally faster than those of the crystallization (10-20 minutes vs. 2-5 hours). This is clearly depicted by the quasi-simultaneous XANES and PXRD data shown in Figure  1) The experiment proved that Ce(IV) reduces to Ce(III) before crystallizing the MOF in all materials tested. 2) Hexanuclear molecular Ce\/Zr-O cluster are stable in solution and thus they can be further exploited in MOF synthesis",

This run was performed by using the \"standard\" 6\/8 HP assembly with hard cubes having 3 mm truncations and enclosing a 7 mm octahedrally shaped sample region. The sample chamber, inside the Cr:MgO octahedron, was a hBN (pressure sensor) cylindrical cavity with 2.2 mm outer diameter, 1.4 mm internal diameter and 2.0 mm length, filled entirely with the precompressed DPhA powder sample. At variance with the DAC and the Drickamer type LVP set-ups, this set-up provided substantially isotropic compression, which led us to the extremely interesting opportunity of investigating the effect of the intrinsic anisotropy of the starting molecular phase on the formation of carbon nano-threads, as opposed to the extrinsic, uniaxial stress related anisotropy typical of the two opposed anvils systems. The P-T path was 0-29-0 GPa, at room T, and the sample has been compressed with continuous XRD data collection in order to characterize the degree of conversion. We also attempted in situ electrical resistance measurements using the Keithley 6430, similarly to run1 and run2, and here too measurements were entirely dominated by parasitic currents, which prevented us to observe the true sample resistance. Then, at variance with what we found with DACs and Drickamer type apparatuses, we did not observe the phase transition at around 8-9 GPa (figure ",

    "title":"Formation and development of induced mechanical strains in the presence of residual strains: A in-situ X-ray indentation on avian eggshells",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The eggshell evolved with the paradox of being strong enough to preserve the embryo from mechanical stresses but brittle enough to allow the chick to hatch. The shell is a biomineralized tissue composed of distinct calcitic layers incorporated with organic molecules at both structural (intercrystalline) and atomic (intracrystalline) scales. These inclusions and microarchitectural arrangements of the crystalline layers result in the combination of high Young\u2019s modulus and direction-dependent fracture toughness in the bioceramics. On the other hand, impurities come with consequence, the formation of interfaces with mismatches that can evolve and integrate internal forces within materials. The presence of these internal forces, which are the sources of residual strains\/stresses, has been reported. However, to this day , how these residual strains\/stresses modulate the mechanical performance and functionality of the eggshell remains unclear.  This experiment aimed to understand the role of organic inclusion on the mechanical performance of the ostrich eggshell. In specific, we intend to elucidate the interaction of applied and organic-induced\/residual stresses and study the role of pre-stresses on the functionality of these bioceramics. The eggshells (fresh and hatched) were cut longitudinally with a fine diamond wire in a small piece of approximately 2mm*150 \u00b5m *150 \u00b5m. The samples were mounted on a holder and aligned to the diamond tip of the home-designed indenter. As a comparative reference, a series of the samples were heat-treated prior to the experiment to eliminate the organic-induced strains. The samples were scanned in no-load, low-load (elastic deformation), high-load (damaged), and unloaded conditions. The allocated time on ID13 was 4 days, the qrange cover was from 1 to 5 \u00c5 -1 at 12.7 KeV, beam size 4\u00b5m * 4\u00b5m, the exposure time was 2ms, and a sample to detector distance of 12cm. The step size was 5 or 10 \u00b5m depending on the resolution needed for the map. The first day was used for the alignment of the indentation set-up and the correction of the rotational displacement (the various cable bringing tensions). The second day was dedicated to the exclusion of the reflection created by the diamond indenter. Accordingly, we started the measurements on 19.11.21 at night. Due to recent results at BESSY on M\u03bcSPOT beamline, we decided to rotate the sample, surprisingly the diffracted signal obtained at ID13 revealed many Bragg reflections at each selected position with a beam size much smaller (4*4\u00b5m at ESRF compared to 30*30\u03bcm at BESSY, see section V). The revealed Braggs reflections\/peaks will allow us to determine the stress orientation with the use of the maximal intensity through the applied rotation range. A summary of the measurements performed during this run: \uf0b7 Full mapping (length from inner layer to outter layer) of the fresh sample (no external load) to investigate the residual strains (0\u00b0 to 122\u00b0) \uf0b7 Mapping (under the indent) of the fresh sample under applied loads allows us to investigate the interaction of the applied and residual stress and strains and their distribution inside the control eggshell, \uf0b7 Mapping (under the indent) of the heat-treated sample under no and applied loads to investigate the organic removal on development of applied strain, \uf0b7 Mapping (under the indent) of the hatched eggshells under no and applied loads to study the structural evolution (resorption of Ca) prior to the hatching and its role on the mechanical characteristics of the eggshells We did not have any problem with the instruments and but a few beam time was lost during the run due to 4 beam shutdowns. For the continuation proposal that will be submitted in September 2022 the local contact advise us to ask for 1 day \"Machine Dedicated Time\" plus the regular 5 days as for the previous proposal. The raw spectra images were processed directly during measurement on ID13 with the in-house software: radial integration of 720 bins taking into account detector calibration run (and electronic background). All processed data were analysed at the MPI with an in-house built Matlab code. The corresponding Intensity and Q values were extracted from the H5 files and classified in a Matlab matrix by X and Y position in the sample. Then, the data were filtered for the noise (single pixel, cosmic rays, impurities), the baseline was corrected with the code by Mirko Hrovat (2009), and SAXS signal is excluded. Then each Bragg signal is fitted with the peakfit code of Thomas C. O'Haver (2015). As shown by Fig 1 : all different fits have a low error and the Voigt fit was the best match for most of the Bragg signal, but the Voigt fit was not optimised for the large brunch of spectra: If most of the peaks were better fitted, some fit showed bimodal distributions instead of unimodal distribution (the parameters could not be optimised for all the peaks to be fitted). This was leading to computer-induced false indexing. The Gaussian signal was constant reliability through all tested Bagg peaks. The Lorentzian fit has an error a bit higher than the two previous fits, inducing mistakes in maximum intensity. Contrary to BESSY the Lorentzian fit was not optimum and the Godness of the Fit gives better consistency with a Gaussian fit. The presence\/absence of SAXS signal is then used to create a mask (map) of the sample position II) ID13 results: Full high resolution map of the fresh Ostrich eggshell For the high-resolution full map of the overall sample, the arm supporting the diamond indenter was not installed allowing a 0 to 188\u00b0 rotation of the sample. The sample was characterised under a 4\u00b5m beam spot size and the step was 5 \u00b5m horizontally and 10 \u00b5m vertically, 161*414 WAXS patterns were recorded. As visible in Fig 2 and 3, the rotation influence the maximum intensity and the presence\/absence of the Bragg signal. This experience aimed to determine the difference between the fresh Ostrich eggshell layers and the crystal residual stress orientation. The eggshell is composed of 6 different layers characterised by a different Young's Modulus, the rotation will help us to collect the maximum peak intensity and have an overview of the organisation without indentation. Those data are currently in the fitting process (high calculation and RAM needed), then the rotation angle has to be considered before the reconstruction of the sample maximum intensity map. III) ID13 results: Stress and strain distribution For those experiments, 161*81 WAXS patterns were recorded per sample\/condition\/rotational angle from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 (step of 2\u00b0). From the previous analysis Bragg peak center maps are reconstructed. Samples were analysed before load, during the loading (the load curve has been recorded by our set-up), and at rest (without load). A first mapping is done by using only the Bragg peak center (from our fit) in one single angle, and we can see the region of interest during the load (see Figs.  Last but not least data interpretation, we will compare the Bragg peak width concerning indentation, taking into account that the rotation influence the width. Once the region of interest is selected in the previously cited map (Bragg center, intensity width) the processed 1D data will be extracted via an in-house built Matlab interface. The background will be subtracted from the WAXS curves and manual fit analyses will be conducted. ID13 results: Effect of Egg hatching\/ heat treatment condition The fresh sample will be compared to the different conditions for each analysis: Bragg peak center map per rotation, max intensity in all rotations, and the width map. This analysis will be performed after the end of the calculation of Step II. As our experiment resulted in a very large dataset (23TB) and automatic analysis of the Bragg peak was performed, a user interface was created with Matlab allowing (without coding skill required) the navigation from the previously created PNG map to the original datasets (raw and processed). This will be used for localisation of the region of interest, checking of the fit (done manually on Origin for the extracted 1D file(s)), and saving the 2D pattern of this ROI.",

    "title":"Studying non-reversible charge-transfer phase transition with time-resolved powder serial crystallography",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to develop time-resolved serial crystallography on powder to study ultrafast and non-reversible photoinduced charge-transfer transition in Prussian blue analogues nanocrystals. A previous experiment at ID09 revealed the complete phase switching within the thermal hysteresis, with volume and symmetry change towards a stable phase, precluding so usual pump-probe studies. A second experiment [CH-5458] revealed anisotropic lattice dynamics driven by photoinduced CT small-polarons. Here we propose to develop time-resolved serial crystallography for studying non-reversible processes by using a fresh powder sample for every laser shot. This will allow studying the global out-of-equilibrium dynamics, from the formation of CT small-polarons, to cooperative and macroscopic phase nucleation. Both processes involve volume expansion and symmetry change, fully characterized by shifts of the Bragg peaks, and which have to be probed by X-ray diffraction. The purpose of the CH-6162 beamtime was to develop a new experimental methodology to perform time-resolved serial crystallography on continuously-refreshed powder, in order to investigate non-reversible photoinduced processes in real time. In particular, Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) crystals are known to exhibit thermal hysteresis between two phases: a Low Temperature (LT) phase and a High Temperature (HT) phase, which is accompanied by Charge Transfer (CT) between the two metallic centers (e.g., from Mn III (S=2)-Fe II (S=0) to Mn II (S=3\/2)-Fe III (S=1\/2) in RbMnFe PBAs). The LT-HT phase transition can be driven by light absorption within the hysteresis, leading to non-reversible and even complete transformation, as demonstrated in a previous beamtime (CH-5458)  Using these implementations, we have measured the X-ray diffraction pattern of the dispersed RbMnFe crystals excited by 650 nm light, which induces the non-reversible LT-to-HT transition (Figure  There was no synchrotron radiation at ESRF during the first three days of the beamtime (from 02\/11 evening to 06\/11 morning), due to vacuum issues in the ring. We thus had only three days left for TR-XRD measurements. ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Open metal sites are strong adsorption sites in metal-organic frameworks. Sorption experiments show that the enthalpy of adsorption of ethylene on the materials investigated herein does not follow the trend observed typically for other adsorptives with similar strength of interaction. The experiment\u2019s aim is to investigate the structural response of the MOFs upon exposure to ethylene and compare it to other relevant adsorptives. Samples of several synthesis batches of the best diffracting compound in the MOF series under investigation were filled into capillaries, evacuated under heating, and flame sealed in vacuum or exposed to predetermined pressures of C2H4 and then flame sealed prior to the experiment. Several synthesis batches were used to make sure to obtain useable data in case there were deviations between syntheses and confirm reproducibilty. By the time the diffraction data was collected (at room temperature), these samples had sufficient time to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium of the adsorption. The intention was to use the data to determine the static hostguest structure at different loadings of ethylene. Another advantage of this approach is that one avoids potential exposure to unwanted atmosphere during sample preparation at ESRF. Overview of the measurements: Sample ID Preparation Comment IMB-1-015 Flame sealed in vacuum Expected to yield the desolvated MOF structure. Rietveld analysis indicates ~20 % of water is still on open metal site.

They were transferred into the glove box of the Chemistry Lab, where the capillaries for the indivdual experiments were filled. Variable temperature powder diffraction data was collected for the following samples and conditions: Sample ID Measurement program Comment IMB-1-015 Aborted Several capillaries were prepared and tested. They all turned out to be degraded, i.e. the compound had decomposed in between preparation in the home lab and experiment time (less than 1 week).

    "title":"Charge localization in mixed-valence uranium oxides from diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS)",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"In the uranium-oxygen system an interesting interplay between the uranium charge distribution and crystallographic properties exists. The application of diffraction techniques allows to resolve the structural elements, whereas the assessment of chemical states is usually performed from spectroscopic methods, separate from each other. Ambiguity sometimes remains on the actual charge localization, especially in complex molecules. We propose to perform DAFS around the U L3-edge (17.170 keV) on mixed-valence uranium oxides, in order to obtain site-specific information on the chemical state of uranium. These type of experiments, further supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, can provide a unique and unprecedented insight on the charge localization in uranium compounds, which is invaluable information with respect to nuclear fuel material properties. The physico-chemical properties of uranium and its oxide-derived compounds have been investigated extensively for almost a century. Uranium finds its main application as nuclear fuel in commercial power generation and research reactors, but also in other application fields such catalysis a growing interest is developing, owing to the complex coordination chemistry and the wide range of possible valence states that has been observed. We have characterized the oxide phase known as U3O7 (or more formally U60O140) extensively in the last 5 years, but encountered ambiguous results on the charge distribution. Datasets of X-ray absorption experiments carried out at the U M4-edge and at the U L3-edge did not indicate a substantial contribution of U (VI)  in U3O7  The DAFS experiments were carried out on beamline ID22, which is equipped with a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer. Samples were loaded in glass capillaries with a kapton sleeve, and the packing factor was chosen to limit absorption effects. Sample preparation was performed at the laboratories of SCK CEN, and samples were mailed to the ESRF stores before the start of the beamtime. All samples were first screened at a more typical beamline energy of 35 keV, before shifting the monochromator to the range of interest (17 keV). Several scans were performed in orde to determine the experimental approach, i.e. stepsize in energy, 2theta range of interest, total counting time, number of repetitions, etc. in order optimize the available beamtime. Around 8 h was needed to complete one DAFS measurement, covering a 200 eV range with steps of 2 eV. It was foreseen to measure simultaneous to the diffraction data the fluorescence yield by mounting a detector close to the sample, at an angle to the beam direction. However, it was found out that the fluorescence detector was not able to measure the absorption edge correctly at the predicted energy, while the edge could be observed from the scattered intensity arriving at one of the Eiger dector channels. It was concluded this detector system was faulty, and could not be used. Fortunately X-ray absorption data had been previously acquired on the same set of samples, during different beamtimes at the ESRF, and this data could be used for the further processing of the DAFS data. In hindsight, it would have been valuable to measure the absorption of each sample in transmission mode, during the DAFS experiment, as this data can be directly used to correct for absorption effects in the diffraction data, and to predict the anomalous scattering factors f' and f'' at the incident energies. The prepared samples were systemically measured throughout the available beamtime. For some of the samples (most notably for \u03b2-UO3, but also for U3O8) significant instabilities (peak shifts and intensity variation other from absorption effects) in the diffraction patterns were observed during the acquisition. The origin for these instabilities are likely a result of beam damage. Different sample positions were tried to mitigate this issue, but this was not succesful for the experiment on the \u03b2-UO3 sample. During the beamtime we started with the development of Python scripts in order to process the diffraction data, with the aim to produce a spectrum of the reflected intensity, for a selection of reflections, corrected for the Lorentz factor, absorption and background. The script was further worked out in the later weeks and months, in parallel assessing also the theory of anomalous diffraction and developing a routine to extract information on the anomalous scattering factors f' and f''. Ultimately, the goal is to compare the f'' spectrum of uranium in different chemical states (U (IV\/V\/VI) ), and to retrieve this information also in mixed-valence compounds as a function of the contributing atomic sites. Currently, the routine is being finalized and first results on the UO2 sample are being obtained (see Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process is an effective method to produce light olefins such as propylene. Recently we have discovered unusual propylene selectivity over Ca-containing zeolite catalysts. We assume that the interaction between Ca2+-cites and hydrocarbons occurs in a non-trivial way greatly affecting the MTO mechanism. However, the exact mechanisms behind destabilization of coke precursors and improvement of propylene selectivity remain poorly understood. Here we propose to perform operando XRD measurements at ID31 beamline. With the aid of operando XRD study, we expect to elucidate the difference in the zeolite unit cell parameters during the methanol-to-olefins reaction over Ca\/ZSM-5 catalysts, and correlate the change with gradual increase of hydrocarbons retained. The experiment will allow us to link the hydrocarbons evolution to the structural properties of the catalyst simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding to reveal the catalyst deactivation mechanism. The data have been fully analyzed and we are working on including them in a publication. With the aid of operando XRD study, we elucidated the difference in the zeolite cell size and a-and b-unit cell parameters upon the MTO reaction over HZSM-5, Ca\/ZSM-5, Sr\/ZSM-5 and Na\/ZSM-5 catalysts and correlated the change with gradual increase of hydrocarbons retained. First, we acquired the diffractogram arrays upon the working catalyst from five different positions along the bed (Fig. ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The capability to address and to individually manipulate molecular magnetic moments is a prerequisite for the fabrication of future information technology devices that will incorporate molecular magnetic materials. This is possible for chiral magnetic materials displaying the magnetoelectric effect, where the absence of inversion symmetry leads to efficient coupling of local electric fields to the molecular magnetic moment. This magnetoelectric coupling leads to magnetochiral dichroism (MXD). To achieve a sizeable magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for efficient manipulation of molecular magnetic moments by electric fields, strong spin-orbit coupling in the targeted material is required. Thus, lanthanide-based materials appear as excellent candidates to this purpose.\r\nWe propose herein to study the MXD of Eu(II) chiral coordination complexes to demonstrate the strongest possible magnetoelectric coupling in lanthanide-based molecular materials. The ability to individually adress molecula r centres on a surface is a requirement for future device implimentation of molecular systems.

    "title":"Exploration of Novel Hydrogen-rich Hydrides at GPa Pressures in Na\u2013Si\u2013H System using NaSi as Reactive Precursor",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Systems A\u2013Si\u2013H (A=Li, Na) have recently attracted attention since computational predictions suggested potentially superconducting and superionic hydrogen-rich ternary phases accessible at high pressures. As a characteristic feature, these A\u2013Si\u2013H phases are built from anionic hypervalent silicon-hydrogen species. Remarkably, their bonding properties relate closely to those of the recently discovered superconductors PH2 and H3S with Tc\u2264203 K. Such binary hydrides, however, are observed only at Mbar pressures. Anionic silicon-hydrogen species in A\u2013Si\u2013H phases may serve as recoverable proxies. Our earlier studies at ID06-LVP, ESRF revealed the compound Na3SiH7 accessible by hydrogenating NaH+Si mixtures at 5\u20139 GPa. To unfold formation conditions and phase relations of other predicted stable Na\u2013Si\u2013H phases containing hypervalent Si\u2013H species, we propose expanding in situ hydrogenations at ID06-LVP by employing reactive precursor NaSi in reactions NaSi + NaH + H2 at p,T up to 10 GPa, 700\u00b0C. beneficial, as it allows for efficient mapping of p,T space to not only search for new materials, but also to study their phase behaviour and recovery pathways as well as to optimize synthesis conditions for large scale production and ex-situ characterization. ID06-LVP offers a unique opportunity to collect time-resolved angledispersive in situ PXRD during the reactions in multicomponent systems at GPa pressures while providing stable heating over a wide range of temperatures and sufficiently large sample volumes.  Sample preparation for CH-6290 was performed in advance at DESY and handled entirely in an Ar-filled glovebox due to air and moisture sensitivity of the starting materials. Powdered sodium silicide (NaSi) in a pure form or mixed with NaH in 1:1 molar ratio was pressed into pellets of either 1.5 or 2 mm outer diameter (OD) and 0.8-1 mm height. Along with two pellets of the hydrogen source ammonia borane (NH3BH3) the samples were enclosed into sodium chloride (NaCl) capsules of either 2.5 or 3 mm OD and 2.5-3.5 mm height. Smaller and larger sample\/capsule sizes were used for 10\/5 and 14\/8 multianvil assemblies, respectively. The amount of NH3BH3 per sample corresponded to ~6 \u00d7 molar excess of H2 with respect to Si, while the complete decomposition of the hydrogen source at target pressures was expected at ~300 \u00b0C.  The experiments at ID06-LVP were performed with 10\/5 and 14\/8 multianvil assemblies depending on the target pressure. Sample capsules along with MgO plugs of the same OD were loaded into graphite heaters (3.2 or 4 mm OD for 10\/5 and 14\/8 setup, respectively). The graphite heaters and the two outer ZrO2 plugs (3.2 or 4 mm OD) were then enclosed inside 10 or 14 mm OEL Cr-doped MgO octahedra. The passage of the current was ensured by topping the heaters with molybdenum (Mo) foils with respective OD, which, in turn, were in contact with Mo leads (1 mm OD, 1.6 mm height) inserted into the ZrO2 plugs. The octahedra were positioned between eight gasketed 32 mm tungsten carbide (WC) anvils (5 or 8 mm TEL). To minimize the contribution of assembly materials to PXRD data, X-ray transparent SiBCN cylinders as well as MgO or BCN rectangles were inserted along the beam direction into the octahedra and the gaskets, respectively. The outer side of WC cubes was insulated with epoxy sheets, except the copper foil contacts at the cubes adjacent to the Mo leads. Samples were brought to target pressure in 7-11 GPa range and heated using Delta Elektronika SM6000 power supply by regulating the power. AD-XRD data (\u03bb=0.234375 \u00c5) were collected continuously during compression, decompression (30-60 sec\/pattern) and heating (1-2 sec\/pattern) using a customized DECTRIS PILATUS3 X CdTe 900K-W-ESRF detector. The new detector system was highly advantageous for our experiments as it allowed to acquire the data with very good signal-to-noise ratio at extremely high time resolution and thus detect the slightest changes in the patterns on heating, while accessing wide 2\u03b8 range (~1.8-16\u00b0) essential for structural characterization. The heating rate and duration were adjusted depending on the observed changes in the diffraction and lasted up to 8 hours in order to drive the reactions to completion and study phase transition behaviour of the products. Temperatures were estimated based on power -temperature calibrations of the assemblies performed earlier at DESY, P61B, using type C thermocouple. Heating was terminated either by temperature quenching or slow cooling, and the samples were further decompressed and recovered at ambient conditions. During 15 shifts allocated for CH-6290 a total of 6 experiments were performed, including 2 runs for the hydrogenation of pure NaSi and 3 runs for the 1NaSi:1NaH mixture. An additional experiment targeted formation and phase transformations of ternary hydrides in Ba-Si-H system at ~8 GPa. Four of the experiments (3 performed using 14\/8 assembly at 7 and 11 GPa, one using 10\/5 assembly at 8 GPa) were successful. Other two runs performed with 10\/5 cell at ~11-12 GPa terminated in blowouts during compression and heating. Exact reason for this was not clear, however, it may be related to the pressure-induced phase transition of NaSi and\/or possible instability of X-ray transparent gasket insertions. Both pure NaSi and 1NaSi:1NaH mixture were first reacted with hydrogen at the starting pressure of ~7 GPa. Strong similarities were observed in both experiments. H2 release was expected to be complete by ~300 \u00b0C, however, no significant changes were observed in the patterns until above ~370 \u00b0C. Interestingly, during the further temperature increase several sets of reflections emerged sequentially in the PXRD patterns. The final set of peaks appeared at ~400 \u00b0C and remained unchanged upon slow cooling for the run employing pure NaSi. The time resolution of 1 sec\/pattern allowed us to single out at least four phases in the observed sequence (Fig. ",

    "title":"Insight into the high-pressure stability of hydrazobenzene and pressure-induced polymerization of azobenzene from crystal structure analysis",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"While hydrazobenzene is stable up to at least 28 GPa, azobenzene undergoes a polymerization reaction at much lower pressure of ca. 18 GPa, however, preserving the azo groups. Although a polymerization mechanism was proposed by us in a previous study, the high-pressure structure of azobenzene close to the reaction remains unknown. We propose here to solve the high-pressure structures of azobenzene and hydrazobenzene at pressures up to the polymerization reaction of azobenzene, and up to the stability limit of hydrazobenzene at >28 GPa. This will give us most accurate information on the possible reaction path of the polymerization of azobenzene and the influence of N\u2013H...C hydrogen bonding on the superior high-pressure stability of hydrazobenzene if compared to azobenzene. Overall, the results of the proposed study will contribute to the understanding of the relation between the molecular packing and the mechanisms of pressure-induced polymerization reactions in aromatic compounds. In recent years, pressure-induced polymerization of aromatic compounds has become a well-established route for the generation of novel carbon nanomaterials containing sp 3 carbon-bonded networks. In earlier highpressure studies by Dong et al.  We have determined the crystal structures of azobenzene and stilbene up to polymerization pressure at 28 GPa and 18 GPa, respectively. For azobenzene, the high-pressure phase transition occurred at 13 GPa. It was apparent as a discontinuity in all the cell axes and \uf062 angle, while the unit-cell volume compressed uniformly (Fig. ",

The low temperature magnetic data for FeNb suggest that the observed pressure-induced SCO occurs in an ordered manner leading to the change of the ferrimagnetic ordering to the antiferromagnetic one and then to a paramagnetic state around 1.0 GPa. Each of these pressure-induced magnetic phases is expected to show a different photomagnetic response.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We have prepared four variants of the NcAA9C LPMO copper enzyme: the wild-type and three mutants in which the gatekeeper residue Glutamine (Gln) has been substituted for Glutamate (Glu), Asparagine (Asn), or Aspartate (Asp). We wish to utilize Cu K-edge and EXAFS data to supplement interpretation and reconciliation of electrochemical, biochemical, EPR, and computational data which we have collected to evaluate the effect of gatekeeper residue identity on the stabilization of the Cu site in the +2 vs +1 oxidation states.

Recent computational investigations into the reaction mechanism of LPMO identify a crucial second sphere residue, termed the \"gatekeeper\" residue, as playing a crucial role by engaging the co-substrate in strained conformations to facilitate activation of the O-O bond. In our research, we had recently prepared four variants of NcAA9C LPMO which focused on mutations of the gatekeeper residue. For each variant, both the Cu(I) and Cu(II) congeners were prepared. Data collection on two of the variants (WT and Q164E) in PFY-detected XAS configuration suggested differences Cu(I) congeners of the two species, while the Cu(II) data were similar. However, data collection on other lower-concentration samples were hampered by the presence of background metallic Cu signal (presumed from the cryostat) and strong ice diffraction issues. In order to circumvent these issues, we chose to collect at ID26 using a HERFD configuration. The ID26 beamline was configured for a HERFD experiment and equipped with Si(311) double crystal monochromator for upstream energy selection. The detector comprised of a Johann arrangement of five Si(111) analyzer crystals and an Avalanche Photodetector windowed to the Cu K\u03b1 emission region. Samples were housed in a liquid He cryostat held at 30 K during data collection. The choice of the Si(311) monochromator crystals was made for two reasons: (1) the increased energy resolution relative to the Si(111) would help identfy subtle shifts in the XANES spectra between the mutants and (2) the decrease in flux can be somewhat beneficial for highly photosensitive Cu(II) samples, which easily photoreduce to Cu(I) under X-ray flux. Our research group has previously utilized such a setup to great success with data taken on the Fe-containing sMMO metalloenzyme (data collected prior to the storage ring upgrade at ESRF).  It was nonetheless possbile to collect XANES data of superior resolution (relative to previously collected data using a PFY-detected configuration). The XANES region of the Cu(I) congeners for all four variants were collected, and the improved energy resolution revealed a subtle shift to higher energy for the 1s\u21924p feature of the Q164E mutant compared to the other three variants (WT, Q164N, Q164D) (Figure  In addition to the Cu-LPMO data collected, K\u03b1-detected HERFD-XAS data were collected on small molecule tripodsupported Co complexes of varying oxidation states with either a ligand-centered radical or close-shell complex. This data has been published. ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The experiment will elucidate on the atomic structure, shape, facet orientations and epitaxy of magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) grown on alpha-Al2O3(0001) using grazing incidence x-ray diffraction under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Exposing the NPs to formic acid (HCOOH) allows for tracking of adsorption-induced structural changes inside the particles and at the interface between the organic molecules and the oxide NP surfaces. The interaction at the interface is argued to be the key element for the exceptional mechanical stability of a new class of nanocomposite materials, assembled from magnetite NPs linked by carboxylic acids. A detailed atomistic understanding of the magnetite surface\/ organic acid interface is vital to further tailor the mechanical properties of such novel nanocomposite materials. \u2022 1 Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY \u2022 2 Universit\u00e4t Hamburg 3 Juelich Centre for Neutron Science We investigated the growth of magnetite nanoparticles on Al2O3 (0 0 0 1) substrate by reactive physical vapor deposition of iron into an oxygen atmosphere. In the first step, the effect of temperature and deposition time of iron on the growth of magnetite was investigated. Temperature was varied from 300 to 700\u00b0C in order to grow epitaxial nanoparticles (NPs) with strong facet signal to monitor the CTR changes before and after dosing formic acid. Based on the thermodynamic point of view, elevating the temperature leads to the formation of larger nanoparticles with respect to the Wolff rearrangement. The growth temperature of 450\u00b0C was followed for further characterization as an optimum target temperature since no iron-oxide-related reflections were detected at the higher temperature (700\u00b0C). It is worth mentioning that the reflectivity results on the prepared sample at 700\u00b0C didn't represent the acceptable thickness\/features for the deposited layer. A similar observation was obtained for the prepared sample at Nanolab at DESY. The growth interpretation of magnetite NPs at high temperatures and the propensity of evaporated substances' interaction with the substrate still demand further characterization. In-situ growth of magnetite nanoparticles on the sapphire support was studied at 300 and 450\u00b0C by performing the inplane rocking scans during the growth. To this end, different inplane reflections of magnetite and hematite were selected to monitor the orientation and phase structure of the nanoparticles during the growth. Based on the evolution of the inplane scans through the deposition, it can be concluded that the crystalline structure of magnetite NPs initiated to form instantly after the deposition by recovering the pressure inside the MBE chamber (after closing the oxygen valve and evaporator shutter) since in the middle of the deposition, only a slight increase in 2 2 0 reflection of magnetite is perceived (Figure ",

    "title":"Study How Intracrystalline Amino Acids Tune the Magnetization of Manganese (II) Carbonate",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Incorporation of organic molecules into the lattice of inorganic crystalline hosts is a common phenomenon in biomineralization, and has been shown to alter various properties of the crystalline host. Taking this phenomenon as our source of inspiration, we propose herein to study how incorporation of specific single amino acids into the lattice of manganese (II) carbonate alters its inherent magnetic properties. Our preliminary results show that amino-acid-incorporating paramagnetic MnCO3 exhibits different magnetic behavior as compared to that of pure MnCO3. We will study the effect the incorporation of amino acids have on the lattice distortion and microstructure of the host crystal and correlate this to the measured magnetic properties. We will also study the changes in structure below the N\u00e9el temperature at 5K as well as perform in-situ heating to study the kinetics of the lattice distortion relaxation and correlate this as well to the magnetic properties. \r\n\r\n\r\n Inorganic crystals grown by organisms via biomineralization processes demonstrate fascinating strategies of crystal growth.  T N \u2248 32 K.  MCO was synthesized via both room-temperature drop-by-drop (DD) and hydrothermal (HT) methods, in the presence of the identical molar concentration (80 \u00d7 10 -3 m) in solution of four common l-form amino acids (l-AAs): aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), and cysteine (Cys). These AAs were selected because they are the ones with the most significant levels of incorporation into calcite (for more details, see Experimental Section).  Figure  As both Asp and Cys showed the strongest effects on the magnetic susceptibility of MCO (Figure  We employed synchrotron high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) to detect changes in MCO structure and microstructure caused by the incorporation of Asp. Figure  We used Rietveld refinement to accurately extract the lattice parameters (both a and c) of each sample, and calculated the lattice distortion according to the equation: where a A and c A are the lattice parameters of the Asp-incorporating samples and a C and c C are those of the control sample. Similar to the case of calcite,  Interestingly, along with the induced changes in magnetic susceptibility, Asp incorporation significantly affected the N\u00e9el temperature (T N ) of MCO, namely the temperature of magnetic phase transformation (Figure  Adv. Mater. 2022, 34, 2201652 To further study the effects of Asp incorporation on the magnetic properties of MCO, we repeated our NPD measurements below T N , at a temperature of 3 K. Additional diffraction peaks were observed due to the magnetic phase transformation (Figure  At room temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of MCO decreased with increasing Asp concentration (Figure  where w Asp is the weight fraction of incorporated Asp (as obtained by AAA) and \u03c7 Asp and \u03c7 MCO are the susceptibilities of pure Asp and pure MCO (control samples), respectively. Figure  In contrast to PM susceptibility at room temperature, the increase in MCO susceptibility measured at T = 2 K cannot be explained by a simple rule of mixtures. To explain this effect, we first need to understand what types of magnetic interaction exists in MCO. At low temperatures (below the T N ), MCO is an asymmetric superexchange magnet (i.e., it demonstrates  the so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, DMI).  The significant reduction in the ordered magnetic moment of MCO as a function of Asp incorporation, as observed by NPD, cannot be easily explained in terms of weakening of the DMI. Such a reduction might be correlated to a possible change in lattice symmetry driven by this incorporation. If such a change in symmetry indeed exists, we could hypothesize that the chosen refinement model is not ideal and that a reduction in symmetry should be considered and sought. An additional indication of such a symmetry reduction on the crystallographic level can be demonstrated by refining the oxygen positions of the C2\u2032\/c\u2032 space group (Figure  We have shown for the first time that incorporation of AAs into the crystal lattice of manganese (II) carbonate induces significant changes in its magnetic susceptibility. This phenomenon depends on the magnetic ordering of MCO. At room temperature, MCO is inherently paramagnetic and its susceptibility upon incorporation of AAs decreases following the simple rule of mixture. At low temperatures, MCO is a canted antiferromagnet, which exhibits weak ferromagnetism. Upon AA incorporation, it becomes more magnetically compliant owing to weakening of the superexchange interaction, induced by AAsincorporation-governed lattice expansion. Moreover, as a result of the AAs incorporation, the transformation temperature of these two magnetic states is decreased. This study demonstrates the feasibility of tuning the magnetic properties of a crystalline host via a bioinspired route, namely incorporation of AAs. This method facilitates the use of small, organic biomolecules, which provide the control over the magnetic properties of the host, without the need of changing its chemical structure or stoichiometry. Given the tunability of magnetic properties demonstrated here is based on the change in interatomic distances, we strongly believe that this method can be applied to other magnetic crystals possessing superexchange interactions (among them are Fe 3 O 4 ,  Materials: Stock solutions of 0.2 m Mn 2+ and CO  2-solution to a glass beaker, an appropriate amount of an l-AA was added to the solution (20, 50, and 80 \u00d7 10 -3 m of Asp or Cys, 80 \u00d7 10 -3 m of Gly or Glu), and stirring was continued until the AA was completely dissolved. Meanwhile, 50 mL of Mn 2+ solution was loaded into a plastic syringe, which was placed in a syringe pump. MCO precipitation was initiated by the slow addition of drops of Mn 2+ solution into the CO 3  ii) Hydrothermal (HT) method:  Samples for the NPD experiments were prepared as described above, but because of the higher amounts of material needed for these experiments, four times the amounts of solution (i.e., 200 mL) was used in each case. Magnetization Measurements: Magnetic measurements were carried out at the Quantum Matter Research (QMR) center in the Department of Physics at the Technion. A few mg of each MCO sample was loaded into a plastic holder, which was placed inside a brass tube. The tube was placed inside the SQUID magnetometer (MPMS3, Quantum Design) and the system was sealed and purged with helium. Each sample underwent two types of measurements: magnetic moment versus magnetic field (M-H) at a constant temperature (300 and 2 K), and magnetic moment versus temperature (M-T) at a constant magnetic field (10 Oe), while heating from 2 up to 75 K and after cooling to 2 K at zero magnetic field. Amino Acid Analysis (AAA): As a first step, AAs were removed from crystal surfaces by the addition of 1 mL of 1 m NaOH solution to several milligrams of a sample within an Eppendorf tube. The tube was sealed and agitated for 30 s, and the samples were then centrifuged and washed twice with DI water and twice with acetone. AAA was performed in Xell AG (Bielefeld, Germany). Each sample was dissolved in a weak HCl solution, and this was followed by a derivatization process with AQC (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate).  High-Resolution Powder X-Ray Diffraction: HR-PXRD was carried out on beamline ID22 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France.  Neutron Powder Diffraction: Room-temperature (300 K) and lowtemperature (3 K) NPD experiments were undertaken on the KANDI-II powder diffractometer at the Israeli Research Reactor II (IRR-II) at the Nuclear Research Centre -Negev (NRCN).  Scanning Electron Microscopy: HR-SEM images were obtained with a Zeiss Ultra+ high-resolution scanning electron microscope. The primary electron energy was set to 1.5 keV for all samples; hence, no conductive coating was needed. 15214095, 2022, 34, Downloaded from https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.202201652 by Technion-Israel Institution Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [23\/02\/2023].

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The surface oxidation of platinum is an important process in the degradation of platinum electrocatalysts in polymer-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Upon growth and reduction of an ultrathin Pt oxide layer on the Pt catalyst surface, the surface morphology changes irreversibly and Pt dissolution occurs. In the past we performed comprehensive operando surface diffraction studies of the oxide formation and reduction on Pt(111) and Pt(100) and were able to provide an atomistic view of the oxide growth process. Up to now these fundamental studies have only been performed at room temperature. However, the operating temperature of PEMFCs is around 70\u00b0C and higher. In this experiment, we want to investigate the influence of the temperature on the oxide structure and oxide growth kinetics by operando high-energy X-ray diffraction (HESXRD). Thus, we want to provide further insight into the Pt surface processes under PEMFC-relevant conditions. ",

    "title":"Tuning the magnetic properties of 2D molecule-based magnets via rational control of the layer-layer distance",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"In our group\u2019s efforts toward high-temperature molecule-based magnets, we have recently reported the network Li0.7[Cr(pyrazine)2]Cl0.7\u22190.25(THF) (THF = tetrahydrofuran), which features ferrimagnetic order up to a ground-breaking critical temperature of 515 K. It is the aim of this project to further our understanding of this network by examining the effect of substituting Li+ in the synthesis for other alkali metal cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+). We seek to probe the physical, electronic, and magnetic structure in these compounds via X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD). Elucidating the effects of the alkali metal on the magnetic hysteresis, Tc, layer-layer distance, and other properties will extend our ability to rationally design 2D networks toward desired properties, paving the way for new and improved molecule-based magnets for applications in next-generation devices. The current record for the highest critical temperature Tc for a molecule-based magnet is 515 K, held by the network Li0.7[Cr II (pyz)2]Cl0.7\u20220.25(THF) (1  We note briefly that due to technical issues during the first two days of the ID12 beamtime, we were unable to utilise the better part of these first two days for measurements. These issues were mentioned in further detail in the feedback form our group submitted for this experiment. Compounds 1  The room temperature HR-PXRD diffractograms at a detector distance of 200 mm taken at BM01 of 1  The temperature-dependence of the diffractograms of 2 Na and 3 K was also investigated. Data were collected at 120 K to probe for any potential phase changes at low temperature: apart from slight shifts due to thermal contraction, the diffractograms were identical at 120 K and 300 K. For 2 Na , due to the wellresolved nature of the c-axis reflections (see, for example, the 001 reflection in Fig.  As a final note, we also attempted to collect single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 2 Na at BM01, but these efforts were ultimately fruitless as the samples either contained too many crystallites and simply gave diffraction rings, or no diffraction peaks were observed as the crystallite size was too small. To probe the oxidation state and geometry of the Cr centres in 2 Na -5 Cs , Cr K-edge XANES spectra were measured at room temperature at ID12, using the spectrum of 1 Li as a reference.  The room temperature Cl K-edge spectra of 1  Therefore, we associate the pre-edge feature in the spectra of 4 Rb and 5 Cs to mixing between the Cl 3p and the alkali metal 3d orbitals. For 1  As the intensity of the XMCD signal is proportional to the magnetisation of the Cr atoms, one can monitor the hysteretic behaviour of the system via the XMCD signal as a function of the field. For both 2 Na and 3 K , the rising edge signal at 6000.7 eV was monitored as a function of the magnetic field from -17 to +17 T. The data for 2 Na is displayed in Fig.  The overarching goal of this project is to take the network Li0.7[Cr II (pyz)2]Cl0.7\u20220.25(THF) and increase the distance between the Cr-pyz layers via chemical means, potentially towards exfoliation. A key step towards realising these goals is structural and electronic characterisation of the resulting materials. Through an in-depth HR-PXRD, XANES, and XMCD study at BM01 and ID12, we have achieved a thorough picture of the structural and electronic characteristics of 2 Na -5 Cs . Despite the desired goal of increasing the interlayer distance, HR-PXRD indicated that as the alkali metal increased in size, this distance became lower. The Cl K-edge XANES measurements are consistent with the interpretation that as the alkali metal increases in size, less intercalation occurs, therefore resulting in a smaller interlayer distance. As for 1  The Cr K-edge XANES measurements confirmed identical Cr oxidation states and coordination environments between 1 Li -3 K , all possessing square-planar Cr II centres. The dominant role of the Cr II centres in the hysteretic behaviour of the compounds was demonstrated by XMCD measurements at varying field. Unfortunately, for 4 Rb and 5 Cs , a probable decomposition of the materials precluded a proper analysis of their electronic structures. Overall, the in-depth investigation outlined in the above has given us vital information as to the next steps needed in working towards the goals of this project. New synthetic strategies are required to drive the intercalation of larger alkali metal cations. We have also learnt that the magnetic properties of these materials are not significantly affected by changes in the layer-layer distance, an important knowledge in view of future efforts for rationally designing 2D networks for applications in next-generation devices.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"NaNiO2 is a candidate layered cathode material. It exhibits electron degeneracy in the Ni3+ eg orbitals, resulting in a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion. At lower temperatures, it is both static and co-operative, resulting in a monoclinic unit cell until ~480 K, where the material transitions to a rhombohedral unit cell without a co-operative JT distortion. A recent theoretical study predicts that the high-temperature phase is in fact dynamically stabilised, with the JT distortion surviving the transition at a local level, but appearing undistorted via diffraction methods due to its non-cooperative nature. \r\n\r\nUsing EXAFS at the Ni K edge, in conjunction with recently-obtained neutron PDF, we propose to look at the Ni environment as a function of temperature, studying the bond disproportionation in NiO6 octahedra to see if the JT distortion survives the transition. This will provide evidence for a dynamic JT distortion at high-temperatures.\r\n \u2022 This result is interpreted in terms of the triangular lattice in NaNiO2, as compared with the square lattice in LaMnO3.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims to characterize by Cu k-edge XAS, HERFD-XANES, vtc-XES and RIXS to disclose the finest details on the redox chemistry of Cu sites hosted within a selection of Cu-MOFs. In particular, structural and redox behavior will be investigated during the stepwise methane to methanol reaction. These MOFs, belonging to the UiO-6X family, have been post-synthetically treated to introduce various biomimetic anchoring site, as inspired by the histidine brace coordinating Cu in some enzymes capable of performing C-H bond oxidation. With each technique, will focus on the main reaction stages (desolvation, oxidation and reactivity with CH4). Special care will be put in characterizing the oxidized state, aiming at the identification of potentially active Cu-O species. These outcomes will provide unprecedented structural details on the local environment in such Cu-MOFs at the various reaction stages. This proposal aimed at providing a detailed spectroscopic characterization of a selection of bioinspired metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) containing exposed Cu cations by combining in situ XAS and XES, in order to unravel the finest details of the local coordination and electronic structure of Cu sites upon their exposure to different thermo-chemical conditions. The final goal of this activity is to capture the intermediate stages involved in the direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM), performed by exploiting such Cu-MOFs as catalysts. Within this new proposal, we performed a fully spectroscopy-oriented experiment, by collecting spectroscopic data of outstanding quality we exploited for a thorough quantitative analysis on the local geometry and electronic structure of Cu sites involved in the catalytic process. In detail, we performed in situ Cu K-edge XAS in BM23 and in situ HERFD\/vtc-XES in ID26 to characterize Cu-MOFs at relevant reaction steps. We focused on materials based on the Zr-based UiO-66 and UiO-67 frameworks. In detail, a defective UiO-66 sample has been post-synthetically modified with histidine and then loaded with Cu 2+ ions, in order to reproduce the coordination environment of Cu in the active site of LMPO enzymes. Another class of materials was based on the larger UiO-67 framework, where some of the biphenyl dicarboxylic acid linkers were replaced during synthesis by isostuctural bipyridine dicarboxylic acid. The introduction of the bipyridine motif offered an anchoring site for Cu 2+ ions, with a different coordination geometry. Both in XAS and vtc-XES mesurement, a similar thermichemical protocol was explored to investigate the redox behavior of Cu sites and their impact on subsequent reaction stages: i) initial heating to the optimal desolvation temperature (150 \u00b0C); ii) pre-reduction in H2 at 150 \u00b0C; iii) O2 activation at 150 \u00b0C; iv) reaction with CH4 at 150 \u00b0C; and v) extraction of CH3OH by steaming. At each protocol stage, we collected XAS and vtc-XES spectra. In the case of XAS, the spectral evolution was monitored continuously (time resolution 2.5 min) until spectral invariance was achieved, testifying complete reactivity was reached. In vtc-XES measurments, due to the extreme sensitvity of the samples and consequent long acquisition time, the protocol was explored only until step iii). In Figure ",

    "title":"Investigating the ultrafast mechanisms of complete and non-reversible photo-induced phase transition in Prussian blue analogues using time-r",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to investigate ultrafast, complete and non-reversible photo-induced phase transitions by using the \"streaming crystallography\" methodology developed during our previous beamtime on ID09 (CH-6162). This enables to investigate photo-transformations within the hysteresis, by performing time-resolved X-ray diffraction on continuously-refreshed crystals. First results in Co-doped Mn(III)Fe(II) Prussian Blue Analogues microcrystals revealed full conversion towards the Mn(II)Fe(III) phase after 650 nm excitation, driven by elastic deformations involving cooperative symmetry and volume changes. A deeper analysis of the underlying mechanisms is however necessary, as both phase front propagation and global crystal expansion can intervene. Here we propose to further investigate this point by tuning the excitation wavelength, switching from surface-only to bulk absorption. Additional measurements on PBAs with different Co doping rates will allow modulating the elastic energy cost. The purpose of beamtime CH-6492 was to investigate in detail the ultrafast mechanisms occurring during non-reversible photo-induced phase transition (PIPT) within the thermal hysteresis of a class of molecular materials, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). PBAs are cyanobridged bimetallic compounds whose general structure is M'(III)-NC-M''(II), and they undergo a phase transition based on a charge transfer between the two metallic sites. In the case of the rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate (RbMnFe(CN)6) PBA studied here (called RbMnFe thereafter), the electronic charge transfer is coupled with large structural reorganizations, leading to a phase transition with symmetry breaking between a low-temperature (LT) tetragonal phase and a high-temperature (HT) cubic phase. This leads to a broad thermal hysteresis, where the LT-HT phase transformation can be induced by light absorption. In a previous beamtime (CH-6162), we developed a new experimental methodology to study the ultrafast dynamics of the PIPT in RbMnFe, in the specific case of a non-reversible phase transformation within the thermal hysteresis of the compound. This new approach, that we have called \"Streaming Crystallography\", is based on time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) measurements of RbMnFe micro-crystals dispersed in a continuously-flowing liquid jet. Results from beamtime CH-6162 revealed that PIPT can be complete within less than 1 ns, and leads to a permanent HT phase. However, such a complete transformation occurs only above a laser excitation threshold, whose origin and mechanism remain unclear as many parameters like temperature, excitation wavelength or crystal size can greatly influence the PIPT dynamics. The scope of beamtime CH-6492 was to investigate the specific role of temperature in the conversion dynamics. According to previous stationary studies  Using these new implementations, TR-XRD measurements were done on Co 6%-doped RbMnFe crystals excited by \u03bb=650 nm laser pulses, at different temperatures between -10\u00b0C and +20\u00b0C (Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Our goal is to provide deeper insights into the MSI of Ir NPs deposited on highly graphitized C and TiO2 during OER conditions and to correlate this information with the resulting catalytic activities. Operando electrochemical QuickXAS studies enable us to identify dynamic behavior of the nature of Ir oxide species and its electronic and geometric interactions (oxidation state, local environment) on two different support materials (MSI) as a function of the applied potential (before, during and after OER). In a two-step synthetic route, Ir NPs will be prepared by a colloidal approach and then immobilized either on the carbon or TiO2 support material. From XAS data recorded at Ir LII\/LIII-edges, linear combination fit and EXAFS analysis will be carried out to understand the potential-resolved dynamic behavior of the chemical state of the Ir NPs (2-4 nm) and the nature of catalytically active oxide phase before, during and after the OER. This set of experiments was planned to provide fundamental insights into the metal-support-interactions (MSI) of Iridium nanoparticles (Ir NPs) deposited on three different support materials such as carbon (C), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. Operando electrochemical XAS studies enable us to identify the dynamic behavior of the nature of IrOx species and its electronic and geometric interactions (oxidation state, local environment) on different support materials as a function of the applied potential before and during OER. In a two-step synthetic route, colloiddal Ir NPs were prepared first and then immobilized on either the carbon, TiO2, or ATO support material  During our beamtime, we performed operando electrochemical XAS experiments of different OER catalysts using carbon and TiO2 as support material. Depending on the concentration, XAS spectra were collected in transmission or fluorescence mode to obtain a good signal to noise ratio. A spectro-electrochemical home-made flow cell equipped with our samples deposited on a gas diffusion layer (GDL), a graphite (counter electrode), and an Ag\/AgCl (reference electrode) in 0.05 M H2SO4 was used. A chronoamperomtry method was applied for all measurments starting from OCP to 1.6 VRHE, while holding each potential for at least 10 min in order to obtain sufficient data quality. Due to some technical problems with the monochromator at the beamline, analyses of the Ir LIII-edge XAS data of the samples are very difficult. The monochromator was not stable over a series of XAS measurements. Measurements had to be repeated and therefore not all Ir-based samples could be investigated. XAS data that can be analyzed are shown below in an exemplary manner. Very interestingly, the Ir LIII-edge XANES spectra of the 20 wt.% Ir\/C and Ir\/TiO2 show higher white line intensity compared to the Ir reference foil, signifing a strong oxidation behavior of the Ir NPs. This observation is in excellent agreement with our previous work on particle proximity effect for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)  Overall, we were able to measure operando electrochemical Ir LIII-edge XAS data of Ir NPs supported on C or TiO2 during this beamtime. Due to the particle proximity effect, the Ir NPs supported on carbon are much more oxidized than on TiO2. As the XANES data shows a high oxidation state of Ir, no changes in the potentialresolved XANES data is observed. However, EXAFS data shows an opposite trend in the bond length of Ir-Ir and Ir-O for Ir\/C and Ir\/TiO2, indicating the different formation of catalytically active Ir species during the OER.",

    "title":"In situ XAS on self-assembled Ni-Cu co-catalytic sites on TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 evolution",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We plan to investigate by in situ XAS a photocatalyst for H2 evolution composed, in the as-formed state, of an amorphous sputtered NiCu thin co-catalyst film on a mesoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. 1a). We propose that the active catalytic sites for H2 evolution are formed in situ by (i) dissolution of the NiCu thin film in the dark in the aqueous reaction phase, followed by (ii) Ni and Cu ions re-deposition on TiO2 upon UV illumination. The self-assembled NiCu sites provide efficient and stable photocatalytic H2 evolution. In situ XAS will allow to understand the mechanism of self-assembly of this photocatalytic system and the nature of the active sites for H2 evolution. The present work investigates compositional changes of Ni, Cu, and NiCu co-catalysts on a TiO2 photocatalyst for H2 evolution under transient UV illumination. For this, we performed in-situ XAS measurements in fluorescence mode on 10 nm-thick nanocrystalline Ni, Cu, and NiCu co-catalyst thin films on ~8 \u03bcm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layers. Experiments were conducted in de-ionized H2O and H2O\/MeOH (20 vol%) solutions, under intermittent illumination conditions (i.e., light on\/off cycles). The summary of the experiments is shown in Table  For the in-situ measurements, we adapted a homemade cell (as sketched in Figure  To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, groups of 20 scans were merged and then fitted using the software Athena. This provides a time resolution of ca. 30 minutes. To minimize beam damage, a beam size of 200 \u03bcm \uf0b4 400 \u03bcm was chosen and a scanning pattern was created to acquire each spectrum at a previously unexposed location. To minimize sample exposure to the X-ray beam, the fast shutter was kept always closed except during data acquisition. Before starting the in-situ experiments, references were measured to perform linear combination fitting. Said references were: 100 nm thick sputter-deposited films on SiO2 wafer, and powders of NiO, Cu2O and CuO. The obtained spectra presented severe spectral distortion caused by self-absorption. For this reason, we disregarded such reference spectra and fitted the XANES spectra using reference spectra obtained in transmission mode in previous beam times (e.g., at DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Such reference spectra used for fitting were obtained for metallic Ni and Cu foils, powders of NiO, Ni(OH)2, Cu2O and CuO, and aqueous NiSO4 solution. We discuss in the present report only data for experiment \"Ni_H2O\" for the sake of brevity. Ni_H2O: Figure  The system then proves to be stable over time (up to 136 minutes after immersion), as no further change in the oxidation state of the co-catalyst film can be observed. UV1: More remarkable changes, however, occur during UV illumination (\"UV\" in Figure  Dark2: After switching off the UV illumination (\"dark2\" in Figure  The obtained data allow for following in-situ the behavior of nanocrystalline Ni co-catalytic thin films on mesoporous TiO2 in pure water. Summarizing, no significant changes occur in the Ni co-catalyst without UV illumination. However, irradiation with UV light causes the complete oxidation of the co-catalyst thin film and its partial dissolution according to the following reaction scheme (Equations 1-3): \u210e\ud835\udf10 \u2192 TiO 2 + e -+ h + (1) Ni + 2h + + H 2 O \u2192 NiO + 2H + (2) 2H + + 2e -\u2192 H 2 (3) To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first experimental in-situ evidence to corroborate the observation of Crozier et al.

    "title":"Tracking the evolution of transition metal single atom catalysts for the CO2 electroreduction: an operando HERFD XANES and XES study",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Transition metal-nitrogen-doped carbons (TMNCs) are an attractive class of systems that shows promise application for the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, despite important advances in the field, some open questions remain about the nature, stability and evolution of the possible metal active sites during CO2RR under static and pulsed potential conditions. Herein, we propose, for the first time, an operando combined a HERFD XANES and XES study targeting the CO2RR active species for a series of TMNCs materials (Co, Cu, Fe and Ni TMNCs), relevant for CO2RR research. The unique structure\/electronic sensitivity of these spectroscopic techniques will be fundamental to have access the finest spectral features characterizing the CO2RR active centers, their reactive intermediates and possible C\/O ligands, allowing us to clarify the main reaction steps and explain the TMNCs catalytic properties. The measurements were performed in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte under a static current of -10 mA, corresponding to a current density of -15.7 mA\/cm 2 . The applied current was controlled by a BioLogic potentiostat. Ni K-edge high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption near edgestructure (XANES) and valence to core (vtc) K\u03b22,5 X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements were performed at the ESRF beamline ID26. The storage ring operated in 7\/8 multibunch mode with an electron current of 200 mA. Three undulators produced the incoming radiation, which was monochromatized by a pair of Si (111) crystals, cryogenically cooled. The energy calibration of the incident beam was done using a reference metallic Ni foil by setting the first reflection point of the Ni K edge to 8333 eV. HERFD XANES spectra were collected in a continuous scan mode by varying the incident energy from 8320 to 8450 over Ni K edge with an energy step 0.1 eV and duration 40 seconds per spectrum. The maximum of the Ni K\u03b2 fluorescence line (8266.8 eV) was selected with an emission spectrometer in Rowland geometry with five Ge (620) analyzer crystals (R = 1 m) aligned at Bragg angel of 79.09\u00b0. The emission spectrometer was aligned using the elastic peak at K\u03b2 fluorescence energy. Si avalanche photodiode (APD) with 200 \u03bcm thickness and 10 x 10 mm 2 active area was used as a detector. The position of the beam on the sample was changed after each scan to minimize the possible beam damage, where in total 12 spots have been probed in case of HERFD XANES and vtc-XES. Spectra were normalized by the incoming flux recorded by detecting the scattering from a Kapton foil with a photo diode. As a first step of our investigation, we tried to follow the CO2RR reaction for one hour using HERFD XANES. The collected spectra were normalised for the absorption jump using the ATHENA software and are shown in Figure  Nonetheless, we saw that the spectra quality was sufficient to enable the spectra interpretation using the principal component analysis (PCA)  The PCA analysis of the HERFD-XANES dataset of  while the fifth and furthere principal components encodes just experimental noise. In accordance with this evidence, we supposed the existence of four chemical species evolving during CO2RR conditions. Herein it is worth underlying that in our previous analysis performed on a similar catalysts (collected in conventional XAS mode at Bessy II -KMC 3 beamline) we found that the dataset could be represented by just three components  The extraction of the HERFD XANES spectra corresponding to each species was realised using the transformation matrix approach  The XANES spectra, isolated by transformation matrix approach, and corresponding concentrations profiles are reported in Figure  Afterwards the contribution of the Ni species bound to the two CO groups is stabilised to a contant concentration value of ca. 30%. The fourth component identified by the transformation matrix approach, coincides with the reference spectrum for Ni(OH)2 (\u03b2-form) spectrum and, as indicated before, we associate its presence to a beam effect. The formation of Ni(OH)2 had the largest impact on the concentration of Ni species bound to the two CO groups. In order to obtain more insights on the catalysts speciation and in particular to validate the suggested structures, we acquired the Ni vtc-K\u03b22,5 XES spectra of the sample in the initial state (in air before the reaction) and during CO2RR, respectively. The collected spectra are reported in Figure  , where the \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b are the extreme values of the selected energy range. We tried to confirm these finding by simulating the Ni vtc-K\u03b22,5 XES spectra for these two states. To do so, following approach was used. First, we fitted the HERFD XANES spectra of the first and third component using the Machine Learning indirect approach  Best fit result obtained fitting the HERFD XANES spectra for the first and third components showed in Figure  We tested this approach before on a known compound, the Ni-Phthalocyanine (see Figure ",

    "title":"Exploring flexibility of the new Mn(III)-based MOF",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims to solve the structure of a series of new Mn(III)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a flexible structure, as well as investigating their guest sorption properties. The series of new MOFs is related to the well-known MIL-53, which possesses a breathing behaviour. The originality of our series of MOFs, apart from the fact that it is based on Mn(III) metal centres, is that it has alkoxy bridging linkers. It is known that both, the nature of the metal centres and of the bridging linkers have an important influence on the breathing behaviour of MIL-53. We aim at solving the structure of several of those MOFs with linkers of various sizes (EtO-, PrO-, etc.) with the help of variable-temperature X-ray synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments; collecting very good quality diffraction data is mandatory. Furthermore, adsorption of guests and possible flexibility of the structure of the new MOFs will be investigated with respect to various solvents and gasses. The proposal of experiment CH-6536, \"Exploring flexibility of the new Mn(III)-based MOF\", aimed at solving the structure of a series of new Mn(III)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with an expected flexible structure, as well as investigating their guest sorption properties. The series of new MOFs is related to the wellknown MIL-53, which possesses a breathing behaviour. The originality of our series of MOFs, apart from the fact that it is based on Mn III metal centres, is that it has alkoxy bridging linkers. Indeed, the vast majority of MIL-53 MOFs possesses inorganic OH-bridging linkers, or more rarely F-  The beamtime was sufficient for running all the planned experiments, and experiments on some supplementary samples were performed during the last shifts of the experiment. This included thermodiffraction on various MOF samples to evaluate their activation process, gas sorption in the Mg-gallate (N2O and CO2) MOF, as well as a porous dodecaborate ((Me4N)2B12H12) (CO2), single scan XRD and fast thermodiffraction experiments of a few samples of materials for hydrogen storage and composite materials for solid-state electrolytes. Thermodiffraction data of a high-quality Mn(III)-based terephthalate obtained in methanol enabled us to refine its structure (Figure  Figure  Additionnaly, peak shifting is observed, which, according to a preliminary data treatment, corresponds to an increase in the b parameter and a decrease of the \u03b2 angle of the unit cell. This indicates that the pores of the MOF gradually open with increasing amounts of nitro functions on the linkers. Further refinement of the data is however needed to evaluate the origin of the peak splitting. The structure with the largest pore opening (i.e. using 60 mol% of 2-nitroterephthalate for linker substitution) has been tested for potential flexibility by sorption of CO2, but unfortunately no significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed during this experiment, indicating no or only very low uptake of the gas, with no associated structural change. Similarly, 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Normalized intensity 2\u03b8 (\u00b0) 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Normaized intensity 2\u03b8 (\u00b0) no structural change was observed upon exposure to dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol or dimethylsufoxide (DMSO). A derivative of the Mn(III)-based MOF with naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate as and extended linker was also synthesized in methanol. A thermodiffraction experiment showed that the obtained MOF is a new framework with is similar to the previously described MIL-69 (which has previously been reported only with Al, Ga and V metal centers) (Figure  A. B. C. This new MOF shows interesting behaviour upon exposure to various solvents molecules, as indicated by the thermodiffraction data collected on samples upon exposure to acetone, dichloromethane, DMF, DMSO, ethanol and acetonitrile. Surprisingly, exposure to DMF leads to amorphization of the structure, which was shown to be perfectly reversible upon exchange with ethanol, leading to recovery of a highly cristalline phase of the structure displayed in Figure  Given the efficiency with which the experiments were performed, advantage of remaining beam time (last two shifts) has been taken to study several other interesting systems. This includes several MOFs, porous materials, hydrogen storage materials and composites for solid-state electrolyte applications. Magnesium gallate is a MOF that is known for its interaction with several gases, and has been shown particularly useful for adsorption of CO2, due to the particular S-shaped isotherms occuring during sorption of this gas in this particular framework  A small series of other microporous MOFs was charaterized by thermodiffraction under air to determine their structural thermal stability, as thermogravimetric analysis of the measured samples does not enable this due to difficult guest removal. The knowledge of the thermal stability of the measured samples will enable the optimization of activation processes for hydrogen storage purposes. Thermodiffraction data of a (rare case of) porous cocrystal was also recorded, to complement laboratory data obtained on a single crystal. The aim of this experiment was to determine the structural integrity of the sample under the conditions used in the lab for gas sorption, to elucidate remaining questions about the properties of this sample. A porous dodecaborate, namely (Me4N)2B12H12, was recently obtained by us and revealed the presence of isolated pores. Recent experiments showed that, altough those pores are isolated one from another, gas sorption is possible (as demonstrated by sorption isotherms). Therefore, this material was subjected to an in situ experiment consisting of CO2 loading under a fixed pressure and temperature. The results showed an important change in diffraction patterns upon exposure to the gas, which is promising in further understanding of the sorption processes in this material. Four samples of candidate solid-state chemical hydrogen storage materials were also characterized by thermodiffraction. This will enable to evaluate the structure of intermediates that are formed during the dehydrogenation of the studied solids. A last series of samples, composed of zeolites impregnated with hydrides (solid-state electrolytes materials) was measured by thermodiffraction. This enabled to determine the thermal stability of those composites. We also measured nice single crystals data on two complicated cases within our collobaration with UNamur. The experiments enabled the following about the Mn(III)-based MOFs: -The structure of the terephthalate-based MOF obtained in methanol could be refined on a high quality sample; -We showed that the terepthalate-based MOF obtained in methanol and its multivariate derivatives are rare examples of MIL-53 analogues that do not demonstrate any breathing behaviour upon heating, exposure to gases or solvents; -Partial substitution of terephthalate by 2-nitro terephthalate in the Mn(III)-based MIL-53 derivative leads to partial pore opening; -A new MIL-69 type MOF has been obtained with Mn(III) as metals center, but presents no flexibility upon heating; -The structure of a new Mn(III) MOF composed of terephthalate units was obtained and its reversible (frustrated) flexible behavior was demonstrated by thermodiffraction data. The above described results are currently being complemented with supplementary analyses to prepare a manuscript for publication. Further in-depth interpretation of the obtained diffraction data will also be performed to finalise the refinement and localise light elements in the pores, including guests and alkoxy groups which may have been overlooked by the preliminary data treatment (for example in the MIL-69 derivatives, since bridging -OMe groups were found in the MIL-53 derivative and synthesis conditions where highly similar for both MOFs). Further gas loading experiments on the flexible terephtahalte Mn(III) MOF obtained in ethanol will be performed in our lab to evaluate the potential functional porosity of the material upon gas exposure, despite loss of cristallinity. Data obtained during the other experiments will also be subject of upcoming publications, dealing with among other things: -The activation process and sorption mechanisms of CO2 and N2O in Mg gallate; -The synthesis and porous properties of a rare case of porous cocrystal; -The synthesis and gas sorption properties of (Me4N)2B12H12; -The dehydrogenation intermediates of new hydrogen storage materials; -The structural stability of solid-state electrolytes based on zeolite-hydride composites",

    "title":"DNA and RNA incorporation into minerals: from origin of life to gene therapy",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The interaction between DNA and biominerals is of key importance, as over the centuries it is known to enable the preservation of the organic molecules, encoding the hereditary information, and even give hints to origin of life. Herein, we propose to study the interaction of CaCO3 with  nucleotides \u2013 the building blocks of DNA and RNA and to study how they get incorporate into the lattice of CaCO3 and what is the affect of this incorporation on the lattice. HR-PXRD measurements will allow us to study the interaction of single nucleotides as well as full DNA strands with inorganic CaCO3 crystals. We will be able to unravel the parameters which govern the incorporation of such molecules into the inorganic crystalline structure. This research can elucidate how such interaction enables the preservation of DNA over the years, as well as the use of CaCO3 in gene-realted medical applications such as gene targeting.  Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) is the most abundant biomineral.  Although they do not embrace any structural role, the significance of nucleic acids (NAs: DNA and RNA) as biomacromolecules is undeniable, as they encode the genetic information of all living organisms.  We synthesized CaCO 3 in the presence of two nucleobases, adenosine and cytosine, chemically linked to a ribose ring and one or three phosphate groups. The CaCO 3 samples were grown in the presence of three different concentrations (1, 5, 10 mM), of four different nucleotides: adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cytosine monophosphate (CMP), and cytosine triphosphate (CTP, see Figure  Our first objective was to determine whether the presence of nucleotides during CaCO 3 precipitation results in their incorporation into the mineral's structure. To this end, we used inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to detect phosphorus. These measurements were performed only after a bleaching treatment, which allows us to assume that the phosphorus detected within the samples originates solely from incorporated organic molecules, rather than from molecules adsorbed on the crystal surface (see the Experimental Section for more information). The concentration of the nucleotide molecules in the crystals was calculated according to eq 1 where [P] and [Ca] are the measured concentrations of phosphorus and calcium, respectively (in M), and N P is the number of P atoms in the nucleotide (N P = 1 for AMP and CMP, and N P = 3 for ATP and CTP). As presented in Figure  As CaCO 3 can be found in several crystalline phases,  Figure  Since vaterite is the major phase among the resulting CaCO 3 polymorphs (Figure  where a N and c N are the lattice parameters of the nucleotideincorporated samples, and a C and c C are those of the control samples, respectively (which also contained small amounts of vaterite\ufffd2.706% wt, as was calculated using Rietveld refinement). The calculated lattice distortions are presented in Figure  We used high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) to observe the morphology of the crystals. Figure  To further confirm the incorporation of nucleotides, as well as to study the thermal behavior of the crystals, we employed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure  It can be noted that the total weight loss can be generally assigned to the two main contributions: (i) decomposition of the incorporated organic molecules and (ii) water evaporation,    originating solely from the ACC phase.  We further attempted to understand the mechanism by which nucleotides get incorporated within the vaterite unit cell during crystallization. Considering the synthesis procedure, we can assume that when the nucleotides are set to dissolve in a Ca +2 -containing solution, dissolved Nuc-Ca ion (pre-nucleation) clusters can be formed due to the strong phosphatecalcium coulombic interaction.  This study represents a thorough investigation of the interaction of nucleotides with CaCO 3 mineral. We showed that the presence of nucleotides during CaCO 3 growth promotes the formation of both ACC and vaterite\ufffdtwo of its metastable forms. While the effect of nucleotides on the resulting CaCO 3 polymorph was recently shown,  We believe this research can shed light on the complicated organic-inorganic interactions in living organisms, and specifically, on the synergy between biominerals and hereditary materials. It can explain the mechanism by which nucleic acids are preserved, probably via incorporation within minerals, along with the effect of mineralization inhibition which occurs due to extracellular nucleotides. Moreover, the results presented in this study may open new routes for gene delivery applications via CaCO 3 as a mineral hosting nucleic acids.  \u25a0 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Calcium Carbonate Precipitation. A 0.2 M Ca +2 stock solution was prepared by dissolving calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl 2 *2H 2 O, Spectrum) in DI water. 50 ml of the solution was transferred to a 100 ml glass beaker, and the required amount of nucleotide (0, 1, 5, 10 mM) was added to the beaker and stirred for complete dissolution. The nucleotides used were adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate 99% (AMP, Acros Organics), adenosine triphosphate 95% (ATP, Angene), cytidine 5\u2032-monophosphate disodium salt 99% (CMP, Alfa Aesar), and cytidine 5\u2032-triphosphate disodium salt 97% (CTP, Alfa Aesar). Control (reference) samples were prepared the same way, without adding nucleotides to the Ca +2 solution. The beakers were covered with Parafilm with 3 holes in it and placed in a sealed desiccator, together with \u223c5 g of ammonium carbonate ((NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 , Sigma-Aldrich), for 1 week. During this time, the (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 spontaneously decomposes according to Then, the formed CO 2 diffuses into the aqueous solution and initiates CaCO 3 precipitation After 1 week, the resulting powder samples were filtrated, washed several times with DI water, and left to dry in air. Samples Bleaching. A small amount of each sample was transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Then, \u223c1 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution (NaOCl, \u223c5%, Alfa Aesar) was added, and the tube was sealed and shaken for one minute. This way, the organic molecules on the surface of the crystal decompose, and the incorporated ones are not affected. Then, the tubes were centrifuged (10 000 rpm, 10 min) and the liquid was disposed of. This process was repeated three more times with DI water and then once with ethanol in order to remove all NaOCl residue. Then, the samples were left to dry overnight in a vacuum oven at 50 \u00b0C. Phosphorus (P) Determination. P atoms were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), using an iCAP 6300 Duo ICP-OES spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) for elemental analysis. The dry bleached samples were dissolved in <3% HNO 3 solution (in DI water) and were measured using ICP-OES for the detection of Ca and P. Nitrogen (N) Determination. N atoms were determined by CHNS Elemental analysis, using a Flash 2000 Organic elemental analyzer (Thermo Scientific). Around 2 mg of each bleached sample was weighed together with 8-10 mg of vanadium (V) in a tin (Sn) crucible and was inserted into the CHNS analyzer. The combustion temperature was set to 950 \u00b0C, the carrier gas was He (99.999%), and the flow rate was 140 mL min -1 . Combustion was initiated by adding oxygen gas (O 2 ) at 250 mL min -1 , for 5 s. High-Resolution Powder X-ray Diffraction. HR-PXRD was performed in the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France).  Raman Spectroscopy. A small amount of each selected sample was dispersed on a microscope glass slide and was placed in a LabRAM HR Evolution Micro-Raman. For each sample, the area of interest was selected using an optical microscope, then scanned in the range of 100-1500 cm -1 , using a 532 nm laser. High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy. HR-SEM micrographs were taken using a Zeiss Ultra+ FEG-SEM. The energy of the primary electrons was set to 1.5 keV. Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy. EDS was performed in the Ultra+ SEM. Samples were carbon coated prior to the measurement to avoid electrical charging. From each sample, spectra were taken at three different points. Coherence Length Calculation. The (101) diffraction peak (the most intense reflection of vaterite) of the selected samples was fitted to a Voigt function using the OriginLab software. Then, the coherence length was calculated based on the Lorentzian portion (W L ) of the diffraction peak full width at half-maximum (FWHM).  \u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT * s\u0131 Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at  Crystal Growth & Design pubs.acs.org\/crystal Article https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.cgd.3c00367 Cryst.

    "title":"Following Pd and In phase formation under operando conditions during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Pd\/In2O3 has been shown to be a promising catalyst used for hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. Characterisation of the\r\nPd\/In2O3 pre- and post-reaction combined with theoretical modelling, pointed to the proper anchoring of palladium clusters to In2O3,\r\npermitting particularly improved H2 dissociation. In contrast, in situ XAFS data has shown that In and Pd go onto form a bimetallic nanoparticulate species during reaction. Some of our recent work, has shown that it is possible to create supported Pd\/In (on Al2O3) with a similar level of CO2 hydrogenation performance to Pd\/In2O3. This work provides us with an opportunity to examine the nature of Pd\/In species for optimal methanol yields since the In data in particular will be less dominated by In2O3. We propose to perform XAFS measurements during activation (in H2) and under operando conditions (during CO2 hydrogenation) to follow the structure of Pd and In speciation and to correlate this with performance (activation vs. deactivation). PdIn-C with varying Pd\/In ratios (2:1, 1:1 and 1:2) were tested first. PdZn\/TiO2 catalysts with varying Pd:Zn ratios (1:1, and 1:20) and 5 wt% Pd fixed loading were prepared by the chemical vapour impregnation and used for comparison purposes, amongst others. Combined XAS-XRD in situ studies at Pd, In and Zn K-edge were conducted at the BM31 beamline at ESRF. The catalyst was sieved to a particle size within 106-212 \u03bcm, and it was placed inside a 1.5 mm quartz capillary microreactor with a wall thickness of 10-20 \u03bcm, fixed between two quartz wool plugs. The capillary was glued with epoxy onto the metallic frame that fits inside the furnace to allow for homogenous heat distribution in the capillary. A K-type thermocouple was in contact with the sample bed to monitor and control the temperature. The gas flow rate was controlled by the beamline's custom gas delivery system. The catalysts were reduced in situ in a flow of 5% H2\/Ar gas at 5\u00b0C\/min up to 400\u00b0C for 1h, while the effluent gases of the reactor were analysed by mass spectrometry (Pfeiffer). Samples were then subjected to reaction conditions (1:3:1 CO2:H2:Ar, up to 250\u00b0C at 20 bar) for approximately 1 hour. XAFS measurements were collected at the different edges (transmission and fluorescence mode depending on the edge) in cycles, in which XRD would be the last spectrum to be recorded. These cycles were repeated throughout the whole reduction and reaction processes. XRD patterns were measured in transmission using the DECTRIS PILATUS3 X detector way above the absorption edge. XRD data collected before and after reduction shows a clear increase in the metallic component in all features, though variations can be seen depending on the In:Pd ratio of the system. The Pd1In2\/C post reduction is consistent with a In3Pd2 alloy forming, Pd1In\/C with InPd alloy and finally Pd2In1\/C with InPd3. In all cases we see strong InPd alloy formation. Focussing on the Pd and In K-edge EXAFS during the process shows some small changes during reduction. and b) & d) R-space plots. For all samples, we see little change in the Pd edge on reduction, with the XANES pre-edge showing good agreement before and after reduction, with similar oscillations. The R-space plot shows the same signals are present in both cases, with greater intensity after the reduction for Pd1In\/C only. This is likely due to agglomeration in the system, leading to larger crystalline In\/Pd particles, and hence larger coordination numbers. Significant differences are seen in the In K-edge, with a shift in the pre-edge on reduction to lower energy. This is also seen in the R-space plot as there is a growing signal at 2.5 \u00c5, relating to an In-Pd or In-In distance, whereas the signal at 1.7 \u00c5 has greatly diminished, which is attributed to In-O distances, typical of In2O3 (Indium oxide). Comparing the three samples shows a trend in the amount of oxidic character prereduction. Overall, on reduction there is an increase in the metallic character of the indium, and little change to the Pd. In all three samples there was little change in the XRD pattern during the reaction, and little change in the XAS data. The only notable change was in the intensity of the R-space plot, as a function of temperature. However, we attribute this difference to a change in the thermal disorder, and not to any structural change. The Pd K-edge XANES spectrum collected for the PdZn\/TiO2 samples pre-reduction simulates that of the Pd foil reference for the 1:1 sample, while with higher Zn loading, this spectrum closely resembles that of the PdO reference. This may be due to leftover hydrogen being left in the gas lines from the previous experiment. We have previously observed that these systems can quickly reduced to Pd metal at room temperature in the presence of hydrogen. Both samples follow a similar trend during reductiontheir oscillations dampen to a different extent while the temperature rises. This means that the more Zn available in the system, the larger the extent to which the alloy will form. In this case, the last spectrum (dark blue) for the (1:1) sample looks like a mix of different phases, with metallic Pd as the dominant one, whereas the (1:20) sample seems to be dominated by PdZn contributions. Figure  When it comes to the sample with higher loading, it can be seen that ZnO dominates over TiO2 phases and that reduction conditions also lead to the formation of the \u03b2-PdZn alloy, although in this case, to a greater extent. A broad feature at around 6.8\u00b0 and a shoulder at around 5.5\u00b0 can be seen in the pre-reduced sample. Such features disappear after the reduction and are not seen again; thus, it was assumed that they arise due to unknown substances polluting the surface. These were easily removed after the heat treatments.  The PdIn\/C series showed the formation of alloys on reduction. However, little change was seen during the reaction itself. This shows that any alloy formation occurs during the pre-treatment and that the catalysts are highly stable during the CO2 to methanol reaction. The same trend was observed in the rest of the samples tested, showcasing the stability of these alloys under reaction conditions.",

    "title":"Understanding the effects of manganese on reduction, reaction and dynamic behavior on catalytic activity of nickel-manganese spinel CO2 meth",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Nickel-based spinel are stable, active and selective catalysts for the methanation of CO2, but their stability makes them difficult to activate. By adjusting the composition of such spinels, the reducibility at low temperatures is significantly increased. The methanation of CO2 using nickel spinels has not yet been studied under operando conditions to correlate the structural changes to the catalytic properties. Here, the influence of manganese on the reduction process and its role in the reaction will be investigated. First, investigate in EXAFS\/XANES information on the evolution of the oxidation states and the local coordination environment of the metals (Ni and Mn) during reduction and catalysis. We couple it with XRD, to correlate these changes with accompanying changes in the long-range order of the material. These information will increase the understanding of properties required for highly active spinel catalysts in CO2 methanation and thus contributes to better catalysts. Ni\/Al2O3 is the state-of-the-art catalyst for the methanation of CO2 due to the high selectivity and low cost of nickel. For this catalysts, sintering and oxidation of the nickel particles on the surface leads to a decrease in productivity with increasing time-on-stream, especially under dynamic H2 dropout conditions.  Ni0.9MnxAl2-xO4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 2) catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation of the corresponding nitrates with one molar sodium hydroxide at a constant pH of 9 and concurrent calcination at 800 \u00b0C. The supported NiMn1\/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and subsequent calcination at 500 \u00b0C. Ni & Mn K-edges were measured in the XANES (for Ni: 8270 -8430 eV, Mn: 6500 -6650 eV) or EXASF (for Ni: 8230 -9330 eV, Mn: 6440 -7540 eV) range depending on the experiment. The XANES range is used to determine the oxidation states and can also be used with the linear combination analysis (LCA) to determine phase fractions based on reference samples. The EXAFS range will be used to determine bond lengths. In addition, XRD spectra (energy: 48.6 keV, wavelength: 0.25509 \u00c5) were recorded to follow phase transitions during the experiments. The catalysts were tested using the quartz capillary flow reactor cells (1mm OD) and gas delivery systems available at the beamline. The corresponding spinel (Ni0.9Al2O4, Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4 or Ni0.9Mn1.75Al0.25O4) or supported catalyst were diluted 1:3 with Quartz, pressed, crushed and the 50 -100 \u03bcm fraction was filled into the capillaries. Depending on the experiment, the following procedures were used. The temperature programmed reductions (TPR) were conducted in 10% H2 in He, with a heating ramp of 7.5 K\/min up to 900\u00b0C. Pretreatment\/Reduction of the catalyst was carried out by heating to 450 \u00b0C and holding for 1 h in 10 % H2 in He. The operando CO2 methanation experiments were performed at 350, 400 & 450 \u00b0C for 1h each with subsequent reoxidation at 500\u00b0C in synthetic air for 2h. Furthermore, the effect of H2 dropouts were tested by switching off the H2 supply several times for 1 h with subsequent methanation for 1 h. The XAS-TPR runs show that the introduction of manganese leads to the formation of active metallic Ni sites at lower temperatures. XRD-TPR confirmed that the Ni0.9Mn1.75Al0.25O4 spinel structure is destroyed during reduction from 400\u00b0C and a new Ni0.25Mn0.75O1 phase is formed. In contrast in Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4 the supporting spinel structure stays intact. The H2 dropout experiments revealed no change in oxidation state or activity for any of the catalysts tested. The Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4 catalyst shows high redox cyclability, with Ni & Mn K-edges, phase fractions (LCA analysis of XANES data) and methane yields that remain unchanged after multiple consecutive cycles of active site formation by reduction and active site reintegration by oxidation into the hosting spinel structure (c.f. figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Nitrogen is the element can that store and release the largest quantity of chemical energy through the transformation from its single- to triple-bonded states. A single-bonded, nitrogen-only, solid would be the ideal high-energy density material because of its performance but also due to its eco-friendly nature. One pathway to achieving this is to produce a polynitrogen salt in which a polynitrogen anion is stabilized by a polynitrogen cation. While many energetic anionic nitrogen species have thus far been discovered, options are severely lacking for polynitrogen cations. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the fluorine-nitrogen system up to 130 GPa in laser-heated diamond anvil cells and observe the formation of the first pressure-formed polynitrogen cation. Based on successful preliminary experiments, CoF3 will be used as the fluorine reservoir. All samples will be characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The aim of this proposal was to investigate the fluorine-nitrogen system up to 130 GPa in laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DACs) and observe the formation of the first pressure-formed polynitrogen cation. Previously employed successfully during preliminary experiments, CoF3 was used as the fluorine reservoir and loaded along with molecular nitrogen (N2). All samples were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The goals were: i) the investigation of the fluorine-nitrogen system at pressures up to 130 GPa, ii) the synthesis of novel FxNy solids with polynitrogen cations as well as potential CoxNyFz solids, iii) the determination of their crystal structure by employing in-situ synchrotron SC-XRD and, iv) establishing the produced compounds' equation of state and find out if they are recoverable to atmospheric pressure. BX90-type DACs with culets of 250 to 120 \u03bcm were prepared. CoF3 was loaded along with molecular nitrogen, acting as a reagent as well as a pressure transmitting medium. Pressures were measured based on the equation of state of gold; 1 a small Au chip having been placed inside the sample cavity. As planned, the samples were precompressed to pressures between 10 and 70 GPa and laser-heated to temperatures above 2000 K at our laboratory in CSEC (Edinburgh). These samples were brought to ID11 for single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of the synthesized phases. Over the whole investigated pressure range, our preliminary analysis revealed only two phases besides the precursors: the previously found Co2F3 compound and a CoF2 solid with the fluorite-type structure (PdF2), both shown in Figure ",

    "title":"Operando Vtc-XES and HERFD-XANES Studies on the Water Oxidation Mechanisms of Active Metal-Carbodiimides",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Previously, we performed XAS studies to try to confirm the oxidation of Co centers and Co-O\/-N\/-C coordination. Due to the low resolution of those XAS experiments to distinguish O\/N\/C species with similar Z-number, we were not able to resolve the real active local-structure driving OER in CoNCN\/CNTs. In this proposal, we aim to perform operando Vtc-XES and HERFD-XANES experiments to monitor the local-structure reconstruction processes in metal carbodiimides on carbon nanotubes (MNCN\/CNT, M=Co\/Fe\/Ni) and unravel the effective coordination of metal centers for improved electrocatalysis. The Vtc-XES sensitivity to identify light C\/N\/O atoms in complex metallic matrixes, will allow us to determine the energy shifts in the ligand 2s ionization energies of bound C\/N\/O species upon catalytic activation. This will offer in-depth understandings on the structure-function relationships between coordinating O\/N\/C atoms and metal centers for designing high-performance MNCN-based electrocatalysts. Rechargeable metal-air battery can be a promising energy storage device for renewable energy due to its safety, high theoretical energy density and low cost.  Our previous experiment results indicate that metal carbodiimides (MNCN) can be a promising catalyst for oxygen catalysis. In this experiment at ID 26, valence to core X-ray emission spectroscopy (VtC-XES) and highenergy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption near-edge structure (HERFD-XANES) spectroscopy were employed to uncover the subtle change of local geometry and electronic property in cobalt carbodiimidebased catalysts during ORR and OER. Experiments first started from the beam damage test for sample pellets to determine the measurement method. Next, ex-situ VtC-XES and HERFD-XANES spectra of samples, including pellets and electrodes, were recorded. Because of the serious influence from the bubbles caused by beam irradiation and the intense beam absorption from KOH electrolyte, the electrochemical reaction was performed under several potential in a cell for 1 hour in advance, and then the electrodes were dried quickly and measured. VtC-XES and HERFD-XANES spectra of CoNCN loading on oxidized carbon nanotubes (CoNCN\/O-CNTs) during ORR and highly\/lowly crystalline-(HC\/LC-) CoNCN during OER were collected. The CoNCN\/O-CNTs electrode was first investigated under various potential for ORR by HERFD-XANES. As shown in Figure ",

In particular a set of combined xy and tilt stages for sample alignment on the rotation axis or a hexapod (which would serve as xy and tilt stages) will be acquired.

In terms of personnel, during the first year of the LTP, Ph.D. student B. Bazi (Ghent University) was permanently stationed at the ESRF DUBBLE beamline and closely collaborated with the ID15A group on site to improve on the detection conditions available for micro-XRF at ID15a. 3. Technical and Scientific Milestones Achieved (in relation to the milestones identified in the original proposal): Year 1 Two ID15A beamtimes were scheduled for the first year of our LTP: June 2022 and January 2023. June 2022: Due to the timing of sample allocation from JAXA's Hayabusa2 project, the dress rehearsal for the OSIRIS-REx project (originally scheduled in our LTP as a milestone in the first half of Year 3) was brought forward to our first LTP beamtime in June 2022. Here we measured Caphosphates and carbonates within two CM2 meteorites, as analogue material for the samples expected from the aqueously altered asteroid Bennu at the end of 2023. The Winchcombe meteorite is particularly interesting, since it is a meteorite that was seen to fall very recently (2021) in the UK and was recovered immediately for analysis before terrestrial weathering could occur. One of the main technical aims of this beamtime was, for example, to determine the optimal orientation of the sample relative to the two detectors (one Si-based, one Gebased) and the beam in order to reduce the noise-to-signal ratio for a similar sample size (1-2 mm) and mount (embedded within a 25 mm epoxy disc) to those expected in the Bennu samples. For this, two different orientation set-ups were employed (Fig.  Scientifically, we were able to analyse Caphosphates and carbonates observed within these two samples, including the observation and analysis of a Ca-phosphate-rich rim (around a phyllosilicate nodule) that was revealed to be also Y-and REE-rich (Fig.  During these experiments, similar measurement conditions as previous tests were applied, aside from the implementation of the improved detection geometry where the detectors are mounted under shallow angles with respect to the sample surface, whereas the latter is mounted perpendicular to the primary excitation beam. Additionally, a specialised dualpinhole detector collimator was designed for use with the Ge detector, thus restricting the detector field of view to a narrow volume (approx. 1mm diameter) surrounding the samplebeam point of incidence, and reducing unwanted spectral contribution originating from the surrounding instrumentation. The application of such a collimator has a positive effect on the signal-background ratio compared to alternatively available collimators. These findings are envisioned to be published in the scope of a more methodological manuscript (Analytical Chemistry, Spectrochimica Acta B). Year 2 Year 3 ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Seismic data from the Earth\u2019s core and different accretion scenarios implicate the presence of elements lighter than Fe or Ni to explain the observed seismic density deficit. Here we propose to study in detail the compression behaviour of iron-compounds relevant for the Earth\u2019s core (FeO, Fe3C, Fe7C3, FeS, Fe3S, FeSi) using high energy-resolved X-ray Absorption Near Edges Spectroscopy (XANES) up to 150 GPa.\r\nSuch data are presently not available due to experimental difficulties, but are fundamental for constraining the Earth\u2019s core composition. We plan to use the new compression data on endmembers to develop machine learning programming based on artificial intelligence in collaboration with the University of Toronto.  The aim of this beamtime was to record accurate XANES and EXAFS signal for different Fe end-members as a function of pressure at room temperature. We used the experimental setup now available on BM23, allowing us to simultaneously record XRD patterns, ruby fluorescence to measure pressure and high-quality EXAFS signal at the Fe-k-edge in a Diamond Anvil Cell. Unfortunately, we were not able to analyse the XANES region of the spectra with a 0.2 eV energy resolution using the Si (311) crystal, as previously mentioned in our proposal, as the absorption of the diamond was too high, even using drilled Nano Polycrystalline Diamonds (NPD). The experiment has been mainly carried out using a solid pressure medium, KCl. This pressure medium could also be used as pressure calibrant above 40 GPa, when due to non-hydrostaticity the ruby fluorescence signal becomes too weak. Our first trials using Ne as pressure medium were not successful, potentially related to small cracks in the fragile drilled nanopolycrystalline diamonds.",

The outcome, among other characteristics, is the incorporation of the proteins and organic molecules within the inorganic crystal host. We have shown that this incorporation leads to lattice strains in the host crystal. \r\nRecently, it is becoming evident that water plays a cardinal role in biomineralization, specifically affects the mode of organic molecules incorporation and gets incorporated together with the organics. We now take another step forward and propose to study the effect of trapped water on the incorporation of organic species, and on the crystalline host\u2019s structure and microstructure. We aim to answer the following questions: What is the effect of the water molecules on the lattice? What is the relative contribution of strain and microstructural changes that is derived from the water molecules?  Investigating the effect of amino acid incorporation into the crystal lattice of magnetite: from structure to magnetic properties We synthesized CaCO3 using a previously reported hydrothermal method.  First, we wanted to see whether replacing H2O with D2O has an effect on the resulting CaCO3. Figure  To study how the water content in calcite is affected by organic incorporation, which tends to induce lattice expansion, we synthesied CaCO3 in the presence of aspartic acid (Asp)the amino acid with the highest incorporation level in calcite.  Next, to study how the water content in calcite is affected by inorganic incorporation, we synthesized CaCO3 in the presence of Mg anions, which are known to induce lattice contractions.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The autonomous construction of shelters using in-situ resources, such as via additive manufacturing (3D printing) of regolith feedstock, is a necessary prerequisite and priority to sustain longer duration human presence on the Moon from both a cost and risk perspective. We aim to use powder diffraction data to generate the baseline fundamental description of simulants \u2018TUBS-M\u2019 and \u2018TUBS-T\u2019, with a particular emphasis on phase evolution during sintering and recrystallization. For improved fidelity we propose here to look at the expected strong influence of systematically incorporating two distinct volatile-containing glass beads types according to returned Apollo specimens to 1) characterise the state of the sample during the process as a function of glass content, 2) observe sintering rates as a function of the same, and 3) model sintering behaviour, supported by external mechanical testing. By comparison of the raw simulant profile with earlier in-house measurements using the hot air blower, we were able to exceed the former's 1000 \u00b0C limit and observe increased melting. Using calibration tables, we aimed to peak at 1100 \u00b0Cat which the raw basaltic simulant retains little crystallinity. Although originally configured to reach 154 W, the maximum power had to be reduced to avoid capillary softening and drooping. Initial inference of temperature from the expansion of the Pt lattice constant using multiple peaks however proved inconsistent, although calculation of the idealised Pt lattice parameter at 134 W indicated a maximum temperature of 960 \u00b0C, supported by the retained crystallinity with 50 wt% glass (Fig.  The 1 mm quartz capillaries unexpectedly did not withstand high temperatures and chemically interacted with several of the sample compositions, melting out of the beam before 134 W. In all cases the capillary ruptured at the tip (Fig.  Sample state was observed during the heating as a function of glass content, from which sintering rates may be calculated considering the onset and extent of melting. Although peak broadening is observed at higher glass concentrations, both 50 wt% high temperature curves show a lower amorphous contribution than at ambient temperature (purple lines in Fig. ",

Many stoichiometric compounds have been synthesized in the Fe-H system under pressure, from interstitial hydrides, FeH and FeH2 to compounds, FeH3 and FeH5. Yet, the exploration have been limited to 130 GPa. We propose to explore by combined XAS\/XRD experiment the Fe-H phase diagram up to Earth\u2019s core conditions, in order to uncover and characterize novel high stoichiometry iron hydrides. Behind these scientific goals, the instrumental technique towards ultra-high pressure and hydrogen loading represents a challenge by itself, and experience gained during this experiment will be of benefit to the entire high-pressure community. In order to decouple technical challenges, two high pressure cells were loaded. The two cells were prepared with toroidal DAC design  The main goal was to measure the data quality obtained on the new ID24-DCM beamline at ultra-high pressure and to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of toroidal anvils made of NPD, independently of problems induced by hydrogen loading. We reached during this first run pressure above 300 GPa, with excellent signal-to-noiseratio. EXAFS data allows to determine the first neighbours distance of the hcp structure and determine the pressure in the cell. Fe EXAFS data -Left panel K 2 .\u03c7(K), right panel FT.

An understanding of the speciation and solubility of Nb in hydrothermal solutions is key in helping both Nb exploration and mineral processing. High-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can reveal fine features of the XANES spectra, thus help identifying important Nb aqueous complexes (with O, F and Cl) that are hard to identify using conventional XAS detection techniques. This study plans to measure the coordination structure and solubility of Nb in hydrothermal fluoride, chloride and carbonate solutions at up to 500 \u00b0C and 800 bar to better understand the transport and deposition properties of Nb and its fractionation from its geochemical twin tantalum (Ta) in hydrothermal systems.

    "title":"Characterisation of uniquely preserved soft-tissues and food residues in coprolites from Late Permian and Late Triassic terrestrial tetrapod localities",
    "abstract_inverted_index":" A large number of coprolites (>100 specimens) were scanned at beamline ID19 during two experimental sessions in a total of 12 shifts (plus 2 extra shifts rewarded at the first session due to another experiment finishing early). The experiment was highly successful, releasing far more information from these structures than can be obtained by traditional techniques such as sectioning, and has so far generated two publications  Because this project represented the first use of propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SR\u00b5CT) on coprolites, an initial paper was prepared to demonstrate the method and give examples of its benefits on coprolite material 1 . This paper was published in the highly-ranked journal Scientific Reports and was rewarded big attention in both media and the scientific community. The results were also presented as an oral presentation at the biggest annual conference for vertebrate paleontology (SVPs annual meeting), and the abstract was chosen for the press packet of the meeting. In this initial study, two examples of Triassic coprolites with remarkable food remains (one containg a semi-articulated fish and the other delicate beetle remains, Fig.  Simultaneously, scans of two Devonian coprolites, tentatively attributed to coelacanths, were used together with a specimen with similar gut contents to present one of few examples of conodont-feeding animals yet known 2 . Several other publications are in the pipeline. Two examples that are near submission are based on coprolites from the Upper Triassic of Poland. Firstly, three large coprolites from the Lipie \u015al\u0105skie clay-pit at Lisowice were scanned and shown to contain large amounts of bone fragments (>50% of the total volume), including bones from dicynodonts and temnospondyls as well as crushed, serrated archosaur teeth. The coprolites as well as the serrated teeth are linked (by associated footprints and body fossils) to Smok wawelski, a large predatory archosaur with a poorly resolved systematic position. Our findings show that Smok wawelski was a top predator with a diverse menu, including frequent exploitation of bones (osteophagy) resulting in repeated destruction of its teeth. Osteophagy is rarely connected to extinct archosaurs, with the exception of the Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids that lived some 140 million years later. These results were presented at the International Conference of Continental Ichnology (ICCI), held in South Africa last year. A manuscript is currently in the last steps of being submitted to a high-ranked international journal based on these results. Secondly, coprolites of one particular morphotype (i.e. a \"population\" of coprolites of similar shapes) from the rich Carnian locality Krasiej\u00f3w are shown to contain abundant beetle remains (notably elytra), like the specimen illustrated in Figure ",

    "title":"Decomposing the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility signal of Oman serpentinites by texture analysis",
    "abstract_inverted_index":" The aim of our proposal was the quantitative decomposition of the magnetic susceptibility signal of the bulk rock into the contributions by the different mineral phases of samples from the Oman ophiolite. Measurements of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS) are typically used to describe the magnetic fabric of the rocks yielding high anisotropies and high susceptibilities. As AMS is a bulk sample method, the contributions of the different portions of the single mineral phases cannot be distinguished. Modeling the AMS of the rocks from crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) of the different contributing mineral phases based on single crystal magnetic susceptibilities can be used to deconvolute the contribution of each phase  Diffraction experiments of 37 samples were conducted at the beam line ID22. A transmissional setup with a rotational stage suitable for our sample holder, and a 2D image plate detector were used. For the texture measurements the samples were rotated around a vertical axis with a rotational step of 5\u00b0 within a range of 180\u00b0 resulting in 36 measurement steps. To avoid detector overflow but also to gain enough counts, 20 single images per measurement step were collected and summed up. Exposure time per frame was set to 0.26 s for most of the samples. We used a beam energy of 70 keV with a beam size of 1x1 mm and a sample detector distance of 1600 mm. This allowed us to measure full patterns even of minerals with high d-values. To ensure that we consider possible heterogeneities of the natural material and to improve statistical data representation especially of the mineral phases of low portion, we run up to 20 texture measurements per sample at different height positions along the cylinder axis. In addition to the serpentinite samples we measured several clay samples, which will help to make a correlation between Fe-content and magnetic susceptibility for sheet silicates and their anisotropy.",

    "title":"Micro-porosity and pore structure of ordinary chondrite meteorites using synchrotron radiation micro-tomography",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Micro-porosity and pore structure of ordinary chondrite meteorites using synchrotron radiation micro-tomography The aim of this experiment was to reveal the micro-porosity and its structure within fall ordinary chondrite samples using synchrotron radiation micro-tomography, which allows quantitative determination of porosity properties. A deeper insight into the structure and texture of porosity may elucidate the formation and metamorphism of chondrites in the early solar system. In addition, thermal properties are highly dependent on porosity and thus investigation of porosity properties is necessary for quantitative modelling of thermal evolution, thermal transport properties as well as present state of meteorite parent bodies, asteroids, and small bodies. High-resolution synchrotron radiation micro-tomography measurements of micro-porosity of meteorites are reported in e.g.  The samples in this experiment are all unweathered falls. Two thirds of their average composition is comprised of olivine and pyroxenes and one third of iron-nickel alloys and sulfides. Prior to the experiment at ID19, we characterized the samples by conducting 1) optical studies using thin sections, (2) Backscattered electron (BSE) image studies that provide 2D images of pore structures present on smooth sample surfaces, (3) nitrogen pycnometer measurements that approximate the total porosity value of the bulk samples, (4) bulk thermal conductivity and diffusivity measurements, and (5) bulk and grain density\/volume measurements  In the experimental sessions, we used two imaging configurations, one for low-resolution (LR) and another for high-resolution (HR) imaging. LR imaging provides an overview of the sample, while imaging at HR reveals the detailed porosity structure in a smaller sub-volume. A filtered pink beam was used to generate a polychromatic energy spectrum that illuminates the sample with a peak energy of ~65 keV (LR) or ~78 keV (HR). To form propagation-based phase contrast that enhances the edges, such as between a pore space and a solid phase, and allows quantitative density measurement, the X-ray detector was placed downstream from the sample (2.82 m for LR and 0.1 m for HR). Applied optics had either 1x magnification resulting in 6.5 \u00b5m pixel size (LR) or 10x magnification resulting in 0.65 \u00b5m pixel size (HR). The size of the field of view for the LR scans was 16 mm x 10 mm and 1.6 mm x 1.4 mm for the HR scans. We obtained novel results of three-dimensional porosity properties of chondrites and relationships between them. Figure  Three-dimensional imaging shows the distribution and types of porosity within the chondrite samples. Further, for many of the chondrites imaged in this experiment, quantified 3D pore properties have not been reported in previous studies. It is expected that the major portion of the porosity volume can be detected using highresolution micro-tomography, although it is highly likely that pores below the detection limit exist. The results reveal the contribution of intra-and intergranular void spaces to the total porosity as well as the connectivity of the pore spaces. Connected component analysis shows that the major portion of the total porosity volume frequently exists in only one component (Figure  The imaging data and quantified results of this experiment are useful in exploring the origin and evolution of the chondrites, but they can also be used in many studies utilizing thermal and porosity properties of meteorites, such as orbit determinations, asteroid probing, and sample return missions. Linking meteorite physical properties to currently determined asteroid physical properties gives deeper insight into the structure of the early forming solar system.",

    "title":"Extending of Carbon Dioxide phase diagram for multi megabar pressure range",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Carbon dioxide (CO2) was widely studied during the last years and despite its simple molecular form at ambient conditions, up to seven crystalline polymorphs of CO2 were reported experimentally, in addition to an amorphous form. Despite its terrestrial abundance and astrochemical significance, carbon dioxide was studied only up to pressures 120 GPa and its behaviour at higher pressures remains unclear.  Here, we propose to in-situ single crystal x-ray diffraction study of CO2 at multi megabar pressure in diamond anvil cells. The samples of solid carbon dioxide will be studied after in house laser heating in temperature range up to 5000K and pressures 100-250 GPa and therefore we would like to establish its phase diagram and reveal new possible phases what are in great interest for chemical and geophysical science. The aim of this proposal was to utilize capabilities of ID11 beamline such as submicron focusing and ultra-high flux of X-ray beam to 1) perform high spatial resolution XRD mapping of the laser-heated CO2 samples at pressures up to 200 GPa to build the phase distribution along the sample chamber of the DAC, 2) Allocate the regions of interest on the best crystallites of any detected phases and 3) collect high-quality single crystal XRD data of this phases to perform their structure solution and refinement. At present moment, ID11 is the only beamline that allows achieving these goals, especially with typically polycrystalline CO2 samples, where the growing of single-crystalline domains with the size of above 1 um is barely possible. This study is important for the understanding of nature's most important molecular crystal due to its abundance in the Earth's, other terrestrial planets, asteroids, and other planetary bodies. Three large opening (90 degrees) BX90 type DACs with different culet diameters (80 to 250 \u00b5m) were prepared for this experiment. The CO2 samples were loaded in two of the DACs (80 and 250 \u00b5m culets) from the liquid phase using a homemade cryogenic loading system along with several pieces of Au for absorption of the laser radiation and dissipation of the heat to the CO2 sample. The third DAC (250 \u00b5m culets) was loaded with the carbon disulfide (which has similar to CO2 molecular symmetry at ambient conditions) along with pieces of Au. Au has the very well-established equation of state and it was used as a pressure gauge in all of our experiments. The CO2 samples were compressed to target pressure of 51 (1) and 130 (3) GPa, and laser heated at our home laboratory equipment up to the maximum temperature of ~8000 K. Each of the CO2 samples were heated with 3 different temperatures at different regions of the sample. The CS2 sample was compressed up to 49(1) GPa and laser heated in a similar manner. High spatial resolution X-ray diffraction maps of CO2 sample at 51 GPa were collected and revealed the presence of well known tetragonal CO2-V phase ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The experiment aims want to compare the combustion pyrometamorphism of limestone, which represents the natural analogous of cement production, and cement materials, by means of ex-situ and in-situ high-temperature Synchrotron X-Ray Powder Diffraction.\r\nCombustion pyrometamorphism is a poorly understood geological process involving sedimentary rocks in a first stage of high-temperature combustion , followed by a late hydration stage, leading the formation of natural analogous of anhydrous and hydrated cement, respectively.\r\nThe main focus of the experiment is to get accurate data on (i) mineral assemblages, (ii) crystallographic parameters (cell parameters, coherent domain size and microstrain), (iii) chemical reactions and (iv) phase transitions during heating of limestone. The results will be useful for geology, leading a deeper understanding on combustion pyrometamorphism, and cement manufacture, trying to discover new cement type for reducing the environmental impact. \r\n\r\n The experiment aimed to compare the Combustion Pyrometamorphism (CP) of limestone, which represents the natural analogous process of cement production, and Cement Manufacture (CM), by means of ex-situ and insitu High-Temperature Synchrotron X-Ray Powder Diffraction (ex-situ and in-situ HT-SXRPD). CP is a complex geological process usually involving sedimentary rocks (limestone, marls, clays, among others) in a first stage of HT combustion (up to 1450 \u00b0C), followed by a later hydration stage featured by the hydration, sulfation and carbonation of previous HT rocks. Therefere, limestone-rich rocks (impure limestone and marls) involved in CP result in the formation of natural analogous of anhydrous (CP first stage products) and hydrated cement (CP later stage products). The main focus of this experiment was to get extremely accurate data related to: (i) crystal phase composition; (ii) crystallographic parameters (cell parameters, coherent domain size and microstrain); (iii) chemical reactions and (iv) phase transitions during heating of limestone from in-situ results. Results were crucial for a better understanding of CP, revealing metamorphic reactions and geological feature changes, and improving CM, particularly finding new cement types (i.e., green-cements also called ecocements) and thermal treatent able to reduce the energy consumption hence limiting CM environmental impact. Ex-situ SXRPD were performed on both natural CP rocks (hydrated and anhydrous) and synthetic (laboratory prepared) cement materials (anhydrous and hydrated cements). Anhydrous CP rocks (ye'elimite-larnite granofels, also called larnite-rich rocks, were collected in Hatrurim Basin in Israel)) are composed of larnite (\ud835\udefd-\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 2 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 4 ), ye'elimite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 4 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59 6 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 16 ), spinel (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59) 2 \ud835\udc42 4 ), shulamite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 3 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59, \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52) 2 \ud835\udc42 8 ) and fluorapatiteellestadite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 5 (\ud835\udc43 1-\ud835\udc65\/2 \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc65\/2 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc65\/2 \ud835\udc42 4 ) 3 \ud835\udc39) as main constituent, plus minor amount of brownmillerite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 2 (\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59, \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52) 2 \ud835\udc42 5 ), mayenite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 12 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59 14 \ud835\udc42 33 ) and ternesite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 5 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 4 ) 2 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 )). Whereas, hydrated CP rocks (calcite-rich rocks) are composed of calcium carbonates polymorphs (calcite, vaterite and aragonite), ettringite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 6 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59 2 (\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3b) 12 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 ) 3 \u2022 26\ud835\udc3b 2 \ud835\udc42) and tobermorite 11\u00c5 (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 5 \ud835\udc3b 2 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 6 \ud835\udc42 18 \u2022 4\ud835\udc3b 2 \ud835\udc42) as main crystal phases, associated with minor gypsum (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 \u2022 2\ud835\udc3b 2 \ud835\udc42), thaumasite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 3 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 )[\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3b) 6 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42 3 ] \u2022 12\ud835\udc3b 2 \ud835\udc42), bulfoteinite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 2 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 2 (\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3b, \ud835\udc39) 4 ), apophyllite (\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 4 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 8 \ud835\udc42 20 \u2022 8\ud835\udc3b 2 \ud835\udc42) and aluminium hydroxes (bayerite, gibbsite and nordstrandite). Two different samples of synthetic cement (green-cements) were prepared and investigated: (i) sample BC represents a Belite Cement with high Fe2O3 and SO3 doped, heated at 1200 \u00b0C at laboratory scale; (ii) sample RM represents the pristine impure limestone of ye'elimite-larnite granofels before CP process, which was sampled in Israel in Rotem Amfort Mine, later laboratory heated at 1200 \u00b0C. Crystal phase composition is roughly different between BC and RM samples: (i) BC is mainly composed of larnite, representing > 60 wt.%, brownmillerite and ye'elimite, plus minor srebrodolskite (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 2 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52 2 \ud835\udc42 5 ), mayenite and k-feldspar (\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56 3 \ud835\udc42 8 ); (ii) RM is mainly based on larnite, ternesite, lime (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc42), fluorapatite-ellestadite and brownmillerite associated with minor mayenite and ye'elimite. In-situ HT-SXRPD was performed on impure limestone (RM) representing the pristine rock of ye'elimite-larnite granofels before CP process. Two different experimental set-ups were emploiyed: (i) heating at different selected T (916, 966, 1029, 1040, 1077, 1095, 1111, 1133 and 1182 \u00b0C) with an increasing rate of 15 \u00b0C\/min till 900 \u00b0C and 5 \u00b0C\/min from 900 to 1182 \u00b0C and a stabilisation time of 10 min before data collection; (ii) continuos step-by-step T increase of \u2053 13 \u00b0C without stabilisation time before data collection with an increasing rate of 15 \u00b0C\/min till 900 \u00b0C and 5 \u00b0C\/min from 900 to 1250 \u00b0C. In-situ experiment performed with the stabilising time pointed out four main features (Fig.  SXRPD results on Combusted Pyrometamorphosed rocks (CP rocks) and their synthetic corresponding cement materials highlighted relevant outcomes for geological and industrial purposes. Ex-situ results on CP rocks were fundamental in higlighting the variability of crystal phase assemblage of ye'elimite-larnite granofels (anhydrous CP rocks), which differs mainly in minor phases, such as brownmillerite, mayenite and ternesite occurrence, which the latter could be used to better constrain the formation temperature (geothermometer). Whereas, hydrated CP rocks revealed higher variability of mineral assemblage compared to anhydrous samples and the ubiquitarius occurrence of minor fluorapatite-ellestadite, spinel and shulamitite, confirming different hydration condition from a location to another (i.e., temperature, pH and chemical compostion of water) and the genesis from direct in-situ weathering of anhydrous rocks (i.e., percolation of water or rains) mainly running along fractures, cracks and weather exposed surfaces. In-situ HT-SXRPD on RM samples (impure limestone from Israel) clarified all main changes occurring during heating of impure limestone, helping in estimating formation temperature and metamorphic reactions of ye'elimite-larnite granofels. Experiments confirmed the involvement of Fap-ell, anhydrite and larnite during ternesite crystallisation starting at 966-1029 and 1098-1123 \u00b0C for experiments with and without the stabilisation time before data collection, respectively. This outcome pointed out two different reactions of ternesite crystallisation depending on the availability of anhydrite: (i) if no anhydrite is available \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d-\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 + \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 \u2192 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b-\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc50 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc39 2 (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 5 (\ud835\udc43  (ii) when anhydrite is available, 2 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\u210e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 \u2192 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 (2 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 2 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 4 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 \u2192 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 5 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 4 ) 2 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 )), or 4 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52 + 2 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\u210e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 \u2192 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52 (4 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc42 + 2\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 2 + \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 \u2192 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc4e 5 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc42 4 ) 2 (\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc42 4 )). The partial involvement of Fap-ell in ternesite crystallisation always releases CaF2 which should be partially hosted in mayenite  Dicalcium silicate highlighted during in-situ experiments all polymorphic transitions at temperatures lower than ones reported for stoichiometric dicalcium silicate [3]-  Ex-situ SXRPD experiment on Belite Cement (BC) slightly doped in sulphur with higher Fe2O3 prepared at 1200 \u00b0C showed up a crystal phase assemblage similar to common BCs plus minor ye'elimite and higher brownmillerite content. Therefore, results confirmed to chance of producing BC using alternative raw materials (i.e., impure natural raw materials and wastes) and reducing CO2 emission thanks to lower combustion T (\u2053 150-100 \u00b0C). Results were crucial in better constraining combustion temperature of ye'elimite-larnite granofels, describing metamorphic reactions occuring during heating: (i) ye'elimite-larnite granofels should have formed at T higher than ternesite breakdown T (1111-1133 \u00b0C) and lower than fluorapatite-ellestadite ones (1150-1182 \u00b0C); (ii) ye'elimite-larnite granofels estimated temperature formation (\u2053 1111 to 1182\u00b0C) excluded the reaching of main melting point (1250-1270 \u00b0C, high-T melt) during CP process. Furthermore, in-situ studies on RM samples, representing the pristine rocks of ye'elimite-larnite granofels before CP, pointed out several benefits of reusing impure limestone as alternative raw material for designing new green-cements with better hydration properties compared to standard Belite Cement (BC) thanks to simultaneous minor elements effects (F-P-S-doping): occurrence at lower T of hatrurite and HT dicalciumsilicate polymorphs (\u03b1-Ca2SiO4 and \u03b1'H-Ca2SiO4) compared to Ordinary Portland Cement conditions, boost the reduction of CO2 emission and improves hydration reactivity. This study confirmed the availability of wastes valorisation (e.g., phosphogypsum, solid urban wastes, F-rich sludges, P-S-F-rich rock wastes, etc.) as partially replacing raw materials in cement manufacture being able to cope with the aim of managing wasterelated problems (dangerous elements pollution, reducing land use for landfills and waste treatment costs) and reducing CO2 emissions (lowering combustion T, grinding energy expenditure, fuel and natural raw materials consumption). Experiments on synthetising Belite Cement with slightly doped in sulphur and high in Fe2O3 (BC sample) prepared at 1200 \u00b0C showed the same stable crystal phase assemblage of ordinary BCs with minor ye'elimite and higher brownmillerite: final mineral assemblage was obtained at 1200 \u00b0C, excepted for minor amount of k-feldspar; (ii) \u03b2-Ca2SiO4 was always stable at room temperature without \u03b3-Ca2SiO4 retrograde polymorphic transition even with a slow cooling. These outcomes allow (a) a strong reduction of energy expenditure and CO2 emission for cement plant, thanks for the lower temperature combustion; (b) the positive reuse of Fe-S-rich wastes as alternative raw material, helping in handling raw materials supply (i.e., shortages of bauxite deposits and availability of limestone) and landfill related problems.",

    "title":"Mobilization of rhenium in magmatic fluids with implications for its exploration",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Rhenium (Re) is one of the rarest elements on Earth (average abundance < 1 ppb) and is of fundamental importance for our modern high-tech industry due to its high thermal stability (melting temperature beyond 3100 \u00b0C). Yet the enrichment process of Re in ore deposits is little understood mainly due to the difficulties to perform experiments at extremely high dilution levels and simultaneously at high P\/T conditions. The new ESRF-extremely brilliant source capabilities and several recent technical developments at the ESRF beamlines FAME and BM23 allow overcoming these limitations. We therefore propose to study systematically the solubility and speciation of Re in fluids as a function of P\/T and fluid composition using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) X-ray spectroscopy. The new data will improve our understanding of Re mobilization in magmatic systems and its enrichment process with implications for the exploration of Re. Experiment title: Mobilization of rhenium in magmatic fluids with implications for its exploration Experiment number: ES 976 Beamline: FAME-UHD BM23 Date of experiment: from: 21.4.2021 to: 26.4.2021 from: 30.4.2021 to: 3.5.2021 Date of report: 13\/09\/2022 Shifts: Local contact(s): Elena Bazarkina Denis Testemale Received at ESRF: 13\/09\/2022 Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Angelika D. Rosa* ESRF, Grenoble, France Joao Elias Figueiredo Soares Rodrigues* ESRF, Grenoble, France Harald Mueller We studied systematically the solubility and speciation of Re in fluids as a function of pressure, temperature (P\/T), and fluid composition (sulfur, chlorine, fO2) using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD). Such information can only be obtained through in-situ synchrotron radiation experiments at high P\/T conditions. We covered the range of P\/T conditions that correspond to Re mobilization during hydrothermal and magmatic processes (0.08-0.5 GPa, and 300 -400 \u00b0C) using optimized devices such as the hydrothermal autoclave and the resistively heated diamond anvil cell. We have conducted two key experimental sessions at FAME-UHD and BM23. At FAME-UHD 12 high P\/T runs were conducted in the autoclave up to 400\u00b0C and 800 bars and in HERFD-XAS mode and on the Re L3 edge (10.535 keV -emission at 8.6525 keV). The X-ray emission spectrometer was equipped with six silicon (642) crystal analyzers and energy resolved Ketek fluorescence detector. Tungsten L3 edge spectra (10.207 keV) were acquired throughout the experiment in transmission mode to verify the monochromator angle to energy calibration. We tested first the signal quality using Re standard solution obtained from the dissolution of NaReO\u2084 in distilled water, Re concentrations ranging from 9.6 to 5000 ppm. These solutions were prepared by Harald Mueller (ESRF Chemistry Laboratory). Best signal quality and no precipitation in the beam were observed for the solutions with intermediate concentrations ranging from 2500 -3333 ppm of Re. With the current beamline and detection settings 9.6 ppm of Re could still be well resolved both with HERFD and transmission XAS (Figure  The dissolution experiment on ReS2 in sulfur-bearing solution revealed an unexpectedly high solubility of Re at 400 \u00b0C and 800 bars. Further solubility experiments of Re, ReO2, and ReS2 are required to constrain its transport and enrichment in natural ore-forming fluids. These additional experiments are required to complement our pioneer measurements at FAME-UHD. We, therefore, plan to submit another proposal to finalize this dataset. At BM23 we tested first the detection limits of Re in the diamond anvil cell using a SDD Vortex detector for X-ray fluorescence detection combined with a polycapillary optics similar to our previous works ",

    "title":"Uranium paleo-speciation in lake sediments as analogues for long-term near-surface repository sites",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims to directly determine, for the first time, the evolution of uranium (U) speciation during the last 8700 yrs in naturally U-rich (up to 815 mg\/kg) lake sediments in the French Alps. Preliminary TEM-EDX, XAS data and selective chemical extractions suggest that a fraction of non-crystalline U could have evolved towards crystalline phases at depth in the sediments. Demonstrating such a diagenetic evolution will require to identify and quantitatively determine U species as a function of depth in sediment cores that have been already sampled and carefully preserved from oxidation. This goal can only be achieved by using EXAFS spectroscopy at the U LIII-edge analyzed using linear combination of reference compound spectra. Measuring the paleo-speciation of U will yield unique information on the long-term fate of U(IV) in anoxic conditions representative of near\/sub-surface contaminated media and repository sites. The proposal aimed at directly determining the evolution of uranium (U) speciation during the last 10 000 yrs in a naturally U-rich (up to 5000 mg\/kg) lake catchment in the French Alps. Major issues concerned the mechanisms of long-term U accumulation in the wetland upstream from the lake and the evolution of U speciation over time. This goal can only be achieved by using XAS spectroscopy at the U L III -edge, that is combined in our project with isotopic measurements, dating methods, and mineralogy. Measuring such paleo-speciation of U will yield unique information on the long-term fate of U(IV) in anoxic conditions representative of near\/sub-surface contaminated media and repository sites. The experiment at the 2-pole wiggler beamline BM23 was thus dedicated to U speciation analysis in wetland soils core samples. The beamtime was splitted into two parts, the first one being dedicated to \u00b5XRF mapping in order to localize U a the micro-scale in the soil and \u00b5XANES spectra on were collected to determine U redox state in representative microstructures, including biological remains. As detailed in the publication issued from to this beamtime  Our main spectroscopic results indicate that, at the particle scale, U is associated to a variety of organic constituents of the soil matrix with a homogenous oxidation state. Bulk EXAFS spectroscopy at the U LIII-edge shows that U is mostly mononuclear, with dominant monodentate binding to organic moieties (C neighbors at 3.45 A). An additional minor fraction of U under polymeric forms is inferred from wavelet (CCWT) analysis of the EXAFS data. These observations are reinforced by 1 M bicarbonate extractions that result in the dissolution of 82-96 % of total U, including putative polymeric species. Combining these spectroscopic results with isotopic information, our study by  Past uranium (U) mining activities have raised worldwide environmental, health, remediation and long-term management concerns  Uranium accumulation in wetlands has been well documented (e.g.,  In wetland soils, high U accumulation is enhanced by elevated organic matter content, which provides abundant U binding sites and boosts microbial activity. Microbial respiration in such water-saturated media then potentially generates reducing conditions, favoring U(VI) reduction to less soluble U(IV) species  Several questions remain unsolved regarding the exact mechanisms leading to both U(IV) and U(VI) fixation by wetland soil OM. Among these, the relative importance of sorption and microbiallymediated reduction and the timing of both reactions need to be further investigated  In this perspective, better determining whether U(VI) to U(IV) reduction remains a prerequisite for U scavenging in wetlands may help to better assess the capacity of various types of wetlands to accumulate U as a function of hydrological conditions and geological settings. Moreover, evaluating the necessity to maintain reducing conditions in the long term to immobilize uranium may be useful to improve contaminated soils management strategies, and to optimize natural remediation processes. To that purpose, we combined a series of complementary analyses including U isotope ratios (d 238 U and ( 234 U\/ 238 U)), gamma spectrometry, micro-and meso-scale U solid state redox and speciation data (determined by (l-)XAS) along with micro-X-ray Fluorescence (l-XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDXS) and electron microprobe (EPMA) analyses on two pedologically distinct cores from the Lake N\u00e8gre wetland. We show that the wetland accumulated massive amounts of U (up to > 5000 lg\/g) and we discuss (i) the molecular-scale mechanisms responsible for such a remarkable enrichment and (ii) the U redox and sorption dynamics in this waterlogged soil over a several thousand years period. Lake N\u00e8gre is located at the outlet of a high-altitude catchment (alt. 2356 m) with scarce alpine meadows covering a granitic bedrock, as described in  Both cores are located on the eastern side of the wetland, downstream of a discontinuous stream which flows partially underground and is presumed to resurge in the cores sampling area (Fig.  In September 2019, we collected stream waters upstream of the wetland and downstream where the creeks flow into the lake (Fig.  At three locations up-and downstream of the east side of the wetland (SCE1, ES1, ES2), the waters were vacuum-filtered in the field at 0.2 lm (nitrocellulose filters -GSWP) with a Sartorius filtration unit and subsequently ultrafiltered under positive pressure at 100 kDa with an Amicon cell equipped with regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration disks. Additional (ultra)filtration steps were done but not retained here: a 0.01 lm filtration because of a filter size similar to 100 kDa, and a 1 kDa ultrafiltration which results are not reliable because of potential U retention by the membrane  Unless stated otherwise, most chemical analysis protocols used in this study are reported in  Because uranium is much more mobile in surface environments than thorium (Th), the proportion of detrital U F(U detrital ) in the core soils can be classically estimated from U\/Th ( 238 U\/ 232 Th) ratios, using a simple mixing model where all Th is considered detrital (Equation (1)): where (U\/Th) soil is the measured soil atomic ratio and (U\/Th) det is the detrital atomic ratio corresponding to the bedrock of the studied watershed, measured at 0.26 \u00b1 0.13  The bulk mineralogical composition of the soils was determined by powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) using the Co K a radiation over the 4-80\u00b02h range with a 0.03\u00b0step. Data were collected in continuous scan mode in Bragg-Brentano geometry using a Panalytical Xpert-Pro diffractometer. For SEM observations, sample powders were embedded into a Mecaprex MT1 epoxy resin, polished and carbon coated. A Zeiss Ultra 55 microscope at IMPMC, equipped with a Field Emission Gun (FEG) and a Bruker Si-drift detector for energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS), was used in back-scattered electron mode with a 15 kV emission and at a working distance of 7.5 mm. EDXS micro-analyses were performed as well as EDXS chemical mapping. The micro-scale chemical composition of a few samples was additionally quantified using a Cameca SX-Five Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA) equipped with 5 Wavelength-Dispersive Spectrometers (WDS) and an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), at the CAMPARIS platform (OSU Ecce Terra). The samples were prepared as for SEM-EDXS with an additional C metallization layer. The EPMA was operated with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 10 nA. Ten elements (Na, Al, Mg, K, Ca, P, Fe, Si, S, U) calibrated with standard minerals were analyzed on several positions of each observed structure. We targeted Ubearing phases previously observed by SEM along with additional phases. Because of the high organic content of the studied soil samples, the total values of EPMA analyses are well below 100 wt% (10 to 35 wt%). Results are thus expressed only in atomic percentages (at%). For the determination of U isotopic ratios ( 238 U\/ 235 U and 234 U\/ 238 U), digested solids and waters were spiked with a double-tracer (IRMM-3636a) and U fractions were separated on an UTEVA resin column (Eichrom Technologies). The measurements were performed on a Thermo Finnigan Neptune MC-ICP-MS housed at the PARI platform (IPGP). A dual Scott\/cyclonic spray chamber with a micro-flow PFA nebulizer (ESI, USA) were used as the introduction system. All isotope signals were collected simultaneously in Faraday cups equipped with 10 11 O (for 233, 235, 236, 238 U + and 232 Th + isotopes) and 10 13 O (for 234 U + isotope and 239 Pu + for the estimation of 238 UH + formation) feedback resistors. The instrumental settings were optimized before each new analytical session and typical sensitivity for 238 U + was $70 mV \/ ppb of U. The instrumental mass bias was corrected internally using the exponential mass fraction law  ( 234 U\/ 238 U) activity ratios were obtained by multiplying the 234 U\/ 238 U isotope ratio with the half-life ratio T 238 \/T 234 of the isotopes. Each sample was analyzed 3-5 times, the uncertainties (2SD) being calculated on all replicates. Reference materials (BCR-2, HU-1, AGV-2, RGU-1) were processed and analyzed along with the samples: their isotopic composition are in good agreement with published data (see  In order to quantify the fraction of noncrystalline U, bicarbonate extractions were performed by reacting soils samples with 1 M NaHCO 3 for 100 h in an anoxic glovebox using O 2 -free water, as described in  2.5.1. Bulk U L 3 -edge XANES and EXAFS data collection and analysis Bulk soil samples were finely ground in an agate mortar, prepared as Kapton tape-covered pellets and mounted on cryostat multi-sample holders that were shipped to synchrotron facilities in individual air-tight containers to preserve the samples from oxidation. The containers were handled in a glove bag or glovebox at the synchrotron beamlines. The sample holder was rapidly screwed on the cryostat rod and immediately inserted in the cryostat sample chamber, and further maintained under purged He atmosphere during the measurements. A first set of U L 3 -edge XAS data was collected in December 2018 at 10 K on the undulator beamline P64 (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron -DESY). Ten bulk wetland soil samples from cores C1  A second set of U L 3 -edge XAS data was collected in June 2021 at 10 K on the 2-pole wiggler beamline BM23 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility -ESRF) in order to obtain higher k-range data for the bulk wetland soil samples C1 18-20 cm and C1 20-22 cm (duplicate of P64 measurement). In addition, solid residues obtained after 1 M bicarbonate extraction of samples C1 20-22 cm and C2 2-4 cm, together with the Lake N\u00e8gre sediment bulk sample NEG18-07 184-189 cm already analyzed by  All bulk XAS spectra at the U L 3 -edge were merged, normalized and background-subtracted using the Athena software  U L 3 -edge data for a large set of model compounds (Tables  Least-square linear combination fitting (LCF) of XANES spectra at the U L 3 -edge was performed using a Fortran 90 custom-built software based on a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm, similar to the software used in previous studies from our group (e.g.,  , where N p is the number of fitting components and N is the number of independent parameters corresponding to the energy range divided by the natural width of the U L 3 levels reported by  Shell-by-shell fitting of the unfiltered U L 3 -edge k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra was performed using a Fortran 90 custom-built least-squares fitting software based on a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizing algorithm, similar to the code used in previous studies (e.g.,  For both EXAFS LCF and shell-by-shell fitting, the fit quality was estimated by a reduced chi-square parameter Chi with N ind = (2DkDR)\/p, the number of independent parameters, N p the number of free fitting parameters, n the number of data points, and e the root mean square of the data noise. This latter value was estimated as the Fourier back-transform of the data in the 15-25 \u00c5 R-range, following a method modified after  Chi 2 R ), where var(p) is the variance of parameter p returned by the Levenberg-Marquardt routine for the lowest Chi 2 R value. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) of the k 3 -weighted experimental and fit EXAFS spectra were calculated after having applied a Kaiser-Bessel window with a Bessel weight of 2.5. Continuous Cauchy Wavelet Transforms (CCWT) of the experimental and fitted EXAFS spectra were calculated using the MATLAB script by  , within the 1.5-5 \u00c5 R-range, with e r the root mean square of the data noise in the 15-25 \u00c5 R-range. Comparisons of fit solutions were done according to F-tests at 95 or 90 % confidence. Micro-X-ray Fluorescence (l-XRF) mapping and subsequent l-XANES analyses of soil sample C1 18-20 cm were conducted at ESRF beamline BM23. Data were collected at room temperature and the X-ray beam was focused with two mirrors in Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) geometry to a $3 \u00c2 3 lm 2 full width at half maximum at sample position. An optical microscope focused on sample position was placed right above the beam for proper tracking of the analyzed spot. The sample was embedded in epoxy resin as for SEM observations but within a N 2 -filled glove bag to prevent exposure to air, covered with Kapton tape to limit oxidation during the experiment and placed perpendicular to the X-ray beam. A continuous N 2 flow was applied on the sample surface to prevent oxidation by air over the course of the experiment. The Si-drift fluorescence detector was placed at a 45\u00b0angle between the beam and the sample plane. The incident beam energy was selected using a Si(1 1 1) doublecrystal monochromator and was set to 17.5 keV for l-XRF mapping. The emission spectrum energy was calibrated using the Cu K a and K b emission lines from Cu tape. The XRF spectra were converted to element-specific fluorescence intensity maps with the PyMca software  These l-XANES spectra were rebinned, normalized and merged using the Athena software. LC fitting was done with the same code and same U(VI) and U(IV) standards as for bulk XANES spectra. Energy was calibrated once at the start of the beamtime using an Y foil in single transmission mode. Monochromator instabilityi.e., the deviation of the incident energy during the course of the experiment -was then accounted for by refining an energy shift parameter for the experimental l-XANES spectra to properly fit with the mixture of U(VI) and U(IV) reference spectra. The obtained energy shift values consistently showed a regular deviation trend over time. In order to complement U redox determination by U L 3 -edge XANES and document the possible occurrence of U(V) species, we performed U M 4 -edge High Energy-Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD)-XANES spectroscopy measurements on the MARS beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron in July 2020. Five soil samples (3 from core C1 and 2 from core C2) were prepared as thin sample pellets. The measurements were performed at room temperature, in similar conditions as those described in Le  A qualitative analysis of the U M 4 -edge HERFD-XANES spectra was done by comparing experimental spectra of the wetland soils with spectra of reference compounds. We selected autunite (Ca (UO 2 ) 2 (PO 4 ) 2 \u00c110-12 H 2 O) as U(VI) reference (Le  The redox and speciation of iron (Fe) in four soil samples (2 of each core) was analyzed by XAS at the Fe K-edge on beamline 4-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) in January 2020. Sample aliquots were mixed with cellulose and pressed as Kapton-covered pellets that were preserved from oxidation by air. The measurements were performed at liquid N 2 temperature in transmission detection mode. The incident energy was calibrated by setting the first inflection point of Fe metal foil at 7112 eV, using a doubletransmission setup. XANES and EXAFS spectra at the Fe K-edge were analyzed by LCF using the same code as for U L 3 -edge data, using a set of model compound spectra chosen from a large database that includes several types of iron phosphate, carbonate, phyllosilicate, (oxyhydr) oxide, sulfide minerals in crystalline, nanocrystalline or amorphous state, as well as Fe(II) and Fe(III)-polyphosphate complexes and a natural Fe(III)-humate sample. After a PCA-TT analysis detailed in Supplementary Material, the best fits were obtained with a combination of a minimal set of 5 components that yielded good fits to the whole set of soil samples studied and accounted as reasonable proxies for the diversity of occurring Fe-bearing species: synthetic Fe(II)-triphosphate  Physicochemical parameters (pH, T, ORP, O 2 , r) were measured one year after core sampling at the exact location of the cores (Fig.  At both locations, the conductivity was low ($50 lS\/cm). C1 consists of three $10 cm layers of dark brown (top) to beige (bottom) colors, overlying the granitic sand in the bottom 3 cm; C2 is homogenously dark brown in the upper part, the bottom granitic sand being met at 22 cm (Fig.  Depending on the Fe speciation, the Fe oxidation state in the soil cores may give indications on the soil redox conditions. The soils contain low Fe amounts, increasing with depth from 0.5 to 2.0 wt% in core C1 and from 0.3 to 1.5 wt% in C2. Results of the LCF analysis of the Fe K-edge XANES spectra, as reported in Table  A combined XANES and EXAFS LCF analysis (Fig.  Major differences are observed in the uranium content of the two cores (Table  As calculated from U\/Th ratios, a negligible U fraction (<1 %) is incorporated into detrital minerals, except in the granitic sand at the bottom of both cores, where up to 10 % of U in the finegrained (sieved) fraction is detrital (Table  Both cores show substantial disequilibria in the 238 U decay chain, highlighting differences in the mobility of U and its daughter radionuclides (Fig.  The uranium isotopic ratios 238 U\/ 235 U -expressed as d 238 Umeasured in the soils of cores C1 and C2 are homogeneous (Table  As reported in the Supplementary Dataset, the water of the eastern stream (PI1, SCE1, ES1) show dissolved O 2 levels (from 7.9 to 6.7 mg\/L) at or close to equilibrium with the atmosphere ($7.5 mg\/L at 13-16 \u00b0C and 2350 m elevation). The conductivity is typical of mountainous streams with low values between 31.1 and 34.5 lS\/cm. Redox potentials gradually increase from 157 to 216 mV along the stream course and are higher than that of the soil water at the location of cores C1 and C2. The pH of the stream is circumneutral (pH 6.9-7.4) and increases shortly after entering the lake at ES2, up to 8.2, which may be explained by photosynthetic activity in the lake surface water. Lower O 2 (4.6-5.6 mg\/L), r and ORP as well as slightly acidic pH values (6.1 and 6.4) were measured in the western stream (E3 and ES3). At the time of sampling, this stream was resurging just before crossing the wetland and thus may not have fully equilibrated with the atmosphere. In the ultra-filtered waters (SCE1, ES1, ES2), the partition of U among particles (>0.2 lm), colloids (between 0.2 lm and 100 kDa) and ''dissolved species\" (<100 kDa, including small colloids) was determined by measuring U concentrations (in lg\/L) after the different filtration steps (Fig.  and the colloidal and particulate U fractions increase (from 0 to 24 % in particles). Twenty meters downstream from the stream outlet (ES2, in the lake), dilution in the lake causes a drastic drop of the U concentration (from 9.6 to 2.6 lg\/L) and no more significant U-bearing particles are detected. The western stream contains three times less U than the eastern one, and is slightly enriched in U (+13 %) after flowing across the wetland. The proportion of U borne by particles decreases from 18 to 1 % in the same interval. The lake water on the eastern shore (LAC-E1) and at the lake outlet has comparable U concentrations to ES2, however with significant particulate U fraction (8 and 11 % respectively). The uranium isotopic composition (( 234 U\/ 238 U) and d 238 U) could be determined in the bulk (non-filtered) and 0.2 lm-filtered samples at SCE1, ES1 and ES2 (eastern stream), and in the bulk water of the eastern spring (PI1). As no significant difference was observed between the isotopic signatures of bulk and filtered samples, we further use the average values of both samples. All waters display ( 234 U\/ 238 U) activity ratios above that of soils from cores C1 and C2 (Fig.  The d 238 U signatures of waters show lower variations: both waters sampled upstream of the wetland (PI1 and SCE1) have similar average d 238 U values of \u00c00.32 \u00b1 0.06 and \u00c00.31 \u00b1 0.09 \u2030 respectively. After flowing through the wetland (ES1 and ES2), the stream displays a slightly higher d 238 U of \u00c00.23 \u00b1 0.13 and \u00c00.18 \u00b1 0.10 \u2030 respectively; this difference is consistently observed among all measured d 238 U of the bulk and filtered samples (see Supplementary Dataset). All waters d 238 U signatures are indistinguishable from that of the soils within uncertainties, except for the lower half of core C1 where the soils are slightly isotopically lighter than the outlet waters ES1 and ES2 (Fig.  3.5. Uranium distribution, redox and speciation in the soil samples 3.5.1. Identification of U-bearing phases by SEM, EPMA and micro-XRF mapping High U content in the soils allowed the investigation of resinembedded samples by SEM, revealing a variety of U-bearing phases detectable by EDXS. Representative examples of such U-rich particles are shown in backscattered electron imaging in Fig.  Additionally, thorough SEM-EDXS observation of the samples showed abundant diatom tests, especially in the C1 core, and Fig.  scarce isolated sulfide grains (pyrite FeS 2 or (Zn,Fe,Cu)S x ) in core C1 at depth (18-20 cm) indicating the local occurrence of sulfidic conditions. A few U-bearing phases were further analyzed by EPMA to quantitatively measure their chemical composition: two organomineral aggregates (100-200 lm wide) and a mineral-coated vegetal remain (200 \u00c2 500 lm) (Fig.  Further investigation of soil sample C1 18-20 cm (4726 lg\/g U) was performed using synchrotron-based l-XRF mapping in order to determine the micro-scale distribution of U with a better detection limit than SEM-EDX and EPMA, and to determine the redox state of U in areas of interest (Fig.  The uranium oxidation state was determined by Linear Combination Fit analysis of U L 3 -edge XANES spectra, after having chosen a single set of U(IV) and U(VI) model compounds that were relevant to nano-crystalline or non-crystalline U(IV) species encountered in soils and sediments and that were among the pure oxidized U(VI) and reduced U(IV) model compounds of our database (Table  Experimental U L 3 -edge XANES spectra of bulk soil samples from cores C1 and C2 with their corresponding LC fits are displayed in Fig.  U M 4 -edge HERFD-XANES spectra collected for five of the bulk soil samples corroborate the results of U L 3 -edge XANES analysis. U(VI) appears to be dominant as indicated by absorption peaks at 3727.7, 3729.6 and 3733.4 eV similar to the U(VI)-autunite reference spectrum (Fig.  Experimental U L 3 -edge l-XANES spectra of U-rich areas identified by l-XRF in sample C1 18-20 cm are shown with their corresponding LC fits in Figs.

The coordination number (CN) value of the two axial O atoms was scaled to the proportion of U (VI) determined by XANES analysis (Table  Table 2 Results of shell-by-shell fitting of U L 3 -edge EXAFS data for wetland soil samples C1 18-20 cm and C1 20-22 cm, and selected model compounds (U(VI)-biosorbed, U(VI)-citrate and U(IV)-humus).

Eventually, we also observe the minor but detectable presence of condensed U phases as indicated by a U-U path at $4 \u00c5. This latter signal is particularly observed in the C1 sample at depth 20-22 cm, as attested by the fitting results (Table  The shell-by-shell fitting results obtained for the U(VI)biosorbed model compound were similar to those obtained for the two soils samples, albeit with a more pronounced contribution of C neighbors in monodentate ($3.5 \u00c5) coordination and a similar contribution of U-P in bidentate ($3.1 \u00c5) coordination (Table  U-P distance at $3.1 \u00c5 even when starting from a monodentate configuration. Moreover, in the same study, both monodentate U (VI)-C and bidentate U(VI)-P binding modes were found in significant proportions in calculated uranyl-organophosphate complexes. These findings further support our interpretation of the U L 3 -EXAFS data of the soil samples and of the biosorbed model compound  The shell-by-shell fitting results obtained for the U(VI)-citrate model compound (synthesized in this study) indicated 6 equatorial atoms with a narrow distance distribution, and second neighbor C atoms showing a distribution of U-C distances in the 2.9-3.5 \u00c5 range (Table  Shell-by-shell fitting results for the U(IV)-humus model compound sample (Table  The lower quality of the U L 3 -edge EXAFS spectra of the other soil samples from cores C1 and C2 precluded a reliable shell-byshell analysis. However, as indicated above, LC fitting of these EXAFS spectra produced similar results for all soil samples (Table  Altogether, the results of XAS analyses indicate that U(VI) and U (IV) are mainly sorbed to organic matter and potentially mineral surfaces (since Si neighbors could be present), in agreement with microscopic observations that show U association with organic soil constituents (Figs.  The 1 M bicarbonate extractions of soil samples resulted in the dissolution of most solid-state U: 92 to 96 % in samples from core C1 and 82 to 93 % in samples from core C2 (Fig.  LC fitting of the XANES spectra of two residual solids showed U oxidation states comparable to those of the initial samples (Table  Interestingly, 10 to 42 % of the initial 232 Th content was found to be leached by the 1 M bicarbonate solution. This indicates that in organic-rich wetland soils, a significant fraction of 232 Th may be associated to labile phases, for example to organic colloids (e.g.,  The structure and chemistry of wetland environments such as that of Lake N\u00e8gre are largely driven by hydrological processes. First, at the wetland scale, the spatio-temporal dynamics of ground-and running surface waters exerts an important control on solutes and particles supply. Second, at the pore scale, complex reactive transport processes take place and regulate U mobility by controlling the spatio-temporal input of nutrients, oxidants and reductants, and by subsequently driving the local microbial activity. For instance, the local U supply may depend on the position relative to the spring input (e.g.,  The texture of the cores points toward an intermediate soilsediment status, with an apparent stratigraphy (also apparent in the radionuclide regrowth profile, Fig.  The oxidation-reduction conditions in the soil pore water at both core locations are hardly predictable as our dissolved oxygen measurements may be overestimated close to the water-air interface. We hypothesize that the O 2 supplied by creeks or diffusing from the atmosphere is consumed by aerobic microbial activity in these organic soils. Overall, the soil redox conditions are probably controlled by seasonal variations of the water table, from fully reducing conditions when the soils are waterlogged (particularly during snowmelt) to more oxidizing conditions in dry periods (such as the time of sampling in September). These global oxidizing conditions are in line with the Fe and U oxidation states observed in bulk soil samples, that are dominated by Fe(III) (69 to 88 % of total Fe, Table  The two soil cores strongly differ in their organic matter content and composition. Core C1 contains relatively low OM amounts ($10 wt% TOC) with low C\/N ratios around 12.7 (Fig.  These differences between cores C1 and C2 are attributed to their contrasting depositional environments (Fig.  As the U concentrations measured in the wetland soils (up to 5200 lg\/g) are far above the U content of the bedrock (2-6 lg\/g,  The apparent decrease in dissolved U concentrations along the eastern stream path (Fig.  The U concentration in the western stream (points E3, ES3) appears to slightly increase after crossing the wetland (Fig.  The d 238 U isotopic composition of the soil samples from cores C1 and C2 was shown to be indistinguishable from the stream waters sampled up-and downstream of the wetland (Fig.  The identification of sorption as the dominant U scavenging mechanism would be consistent with the distribution, redox and speciation of U in the soils. Uranium was shown to be dispersed on a variety of phases, especially organic particles, with variable accumulations that are attributed to heterogeneous affinities of the adsorbing substrates for U (Figs. 5 to 7). Most U is present as U(VI), indicating that U reduction may not be the only required mechanism for U partitioning in the solid phase. The U speciation determined by EXAFS to be dominantly mononuclear\/noncrystalline, with U bound essentially to organic C moieties in monodentate coordination, and the high extent of U extraction by 1 M bicarbonate also support U sorption as the main U fixation process. Incidentally, U binding to C-rich molecules is thought to be the main cause of beam-damage, here U(VI) photo-reduction under the synchrotron beam, which we overcame by using cryogenic temperatures  The high U contents recorded on organic particles including vegetal remains (Figs. 5 to 7) -up to more than 3 at% -indicates the presence of binding sites with very high affinity for U. The type of U-binding organic moieties could not be determined, but we suspect that S and Ca play a major role, as all three elements contents are well correlated at the micro-scale (Fig.  One interesting finding of this study is that the U oxidation state at the micro-scale in one sample (C1 18-20 cm) was found to be homogeneous despite the variety of observed U-bearing phases (Table  Interestingly, the residual U fractions after 1 M bicarbonate extraction have a comparable U oxidation state to that of the initial soil sample and are still dominated by U(VI) (Tables  Although the U oxidation state is dominated by U(VI), significant proportions of U(IV) are detected. As U was supplied to the wetland by well-oxygenated streams, i.e., presumably in U(VI) forms, this means that a fraction of U(VI) was reduced to U(IV) within the wetland. A remaining question is the timing of such U (VI) reduction, before or after U(VI) sorption. d 238 U isotopic ratios are complementary of the redox and speciation analyses and may help in solving this issue. Direct reduction of aqueous U(VI) to U(IV) would likely have resulted in the incorporation of poorly soluble U(IV) in the solid phase following precipitation or sorption, and to an associated isotopic fractionation of $1 \u2030 (U(IV) being isotopically heavier than U(VI)), whether this reduction be abiotic or microbially-mediated  Anecdotally, the absence of significant U(V) contribution in the soil samples (Fig.  No major differences were noted in the processes of U accumulation in cores C1 and C2, despite a discrepancy in the amplitude of U accumulation (Table  Such mechanisms of U mobility in the wetland soils may provide a satisfactory explanation to the soil ( 234 U\/ 238 U) ratios that are lower than the stream waters ratios (1.155 and 1.129) upstream from the wetland (Fig.  The radioactive disequilibria in the 238 U decay chain (Fig.  As shown in Fig.  Our model provides an estimation of the mean age of U accumulation in the wetland soils, which may be considered as an approximate age of soil formation, with high uncertainties due to radionuclide losses. Accordingly, the calculated soil ages span a range from 14.5 to 2-3 kyr BP and are consistent with the sample depths: deep soils generally appear to be older than upper soils (Fig.  A few upper soil samples, especially from core C1, appear to have gained Ra as they are plotted above the closed system Concordia (Fig.  The present study combines a series of complementary geochemical and mineralogical techniques to provide a comprehensive view of the U scavenging mechanisms in two soil cores sampled in a natural mountainous wetland impacted by U supply for $14500 y. In the Lake N\u00e8gre wetland, U likely originates from a (yet unidentified) U-rich source rock within the granite massif, the interaction of which with meteoric waters supplies dissolved U that is transported to the surface and subsequently to the wetland by running stream waters. This continuous U supply over thousands of years resulted in considerable U accumulation by organic complexation in the wetland soils, essentially in noncrystalline\/ mononuclear forms. Bulk and l-XAS revealed that U is mostly present as mononuclear U(VI) sorbed to carboxyl groups of organic matter, and, to a lesser extent, as polymeric U(VI) species at least in the U-richest samples (3000-5000 lg\/g U). Both mononuclear and polymeric phases were extracted by 1 M bicarbonate (82-96 %). From a methodological standpoint, our extensive analyses using XAS at the U L 3 -and M 4 -edges shows that samples containing noncrystalline U species are affected by photo-reduction, which could be overcome by dynamic acquisition of short spectra on different spots. According to l-XRF, SEM-EDX and EPMA analyses, U was dispersed on a large variety of mostly organic structures, with different concentrations attributed to variable affinity of U for the binding sites. Measurement of U isotopic ratios (d 238 U) within the inlet\/outlet waters and soils supported the idea that U sorption is the primary U scavenging mechanism in the studied organic wetland soil. Qualitative analyses of isotopic disequilibria in the U decay chain suggest that a fraction of U may have been scavenged for several thousand years in the wetland, especially in the deepest layers of the studied cores. Over such a long storage period, noncrystalline U species did not significantly evolve toward more crystalline phases. The minor detection of condensed, polymeric U species may be due to high U loadings in some of the studied soil layers rather than U aging. In contrast, an evolution toward U(IV)-Si polymeric species was recently reported as a result of diagenetic evolution of mononuclear U(IV) in the anoxic Lake N\u00e8gre sediments  The combination of mineralogical and isotopic techniques does not support significant direct reduction of aqueous U(VI) to solid U (IV) as the U scavenging process in the wetland soils. Such process, if any, is thus not responsible for the exceptional U accumulation in the Lake N\u00e8gre wetland, but rather is the sorption of U(VI) onto OM. The observed U(IV) proportions, that can reach $50 % in the upper soil layers, are essentially due to reduction occurring after U(VI) sorption. The U oxidation state was found to be homogeneous at the micro-scale, which would suggest that the redox of mononuclear U is driven by the ambient redox conditions at the sample (centi-or millimeter) scale. From the perspective of our deep investigations at the core scale, we suggest that the wetland soils act as an active reactor where chemically eroded U supplied by the watershed creeks is scavenged through sorption to organic matter and is then exported downstream to the lake through physical erosion. These organic soils are thus both sinks and sources of U, which in-and-out U transfers probably depend on seasonal climatic events that control erosion. At the time of the creek water sampling, our observations suggest that the wetland was globally acting as a U sink. Better estimating the current U budget of the wetland would require to spatially monitor U transfers at the annual scale, including during extreme erosion events. Depending on the relative importance of erosion intensity and of the rate of U-binding sites renewal (vegetation and OM in general), the wetland could either be in steady state, i.e., scavenge as much U as it exports, either be a global sink of U (if vegetation develops more than is eroded) or a global source (if soil erosion is faster than renewal). As a consequence, the use of artificial wetlands to attenuate the environmental dissemination of U -although likely efficient in terms of global U budget -requires stewardship in the long term, especially during high precipitation events.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We aim to clarify the binding mechanisms of heavy metals (HM) to cyanobacteria exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the biosorption process, which is an innovative, eco-friendly method for HM bioremoval. To our knowledge, the speciation of HM on different EPS fractions has not been investigated yet. For this purpose, the binding between anionic groups of i) released polysaccharides (RPS) and ii) EPS that are associated with the cells surface of cyanobacteria (biosorbents) to Ni, Cu, Zn, and Au will be studied via both XANES and EXAFS techniques. Thanks to its elemental specificity and low detection limit, XAS spectroscopy represents the most suitable method to obtain information on the local atomic structure of the metals biosorbed to heterogeneous biological samples. The obtained data will provide a characterization of the metal-organic materials obtained through this process. XAS investigations at Cu, Ni, Zn K-edges were performed at the beamline BM08-LISA at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Experiments were carried out in the first experimental hutch (EH1) adopting a non-focused beam (1mmx2mm ca) and Si(311) monochromator crystals. Estimated flux on the sample was ~ 8*10 9 ph\/s. In order to reduce the possibility of beam damage, measurements were performed in vacuum at 80 K using a cold finger LN2 cryostat (T 80 K). XAS spectra were acquired in fluorescence (cyanobacteria samples, summarised in table  XANES spectra and extracted EXAFS of the samples are shown below. This is a preliminary report: since the analysis of the spectra is still ongoing, the data will be updated in the following weeks. Table 2.

    "title":"Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction Investigation of the Heterogenous High Tc La-H Mixtures",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Recent experiments have demonstrated an astonishing close-to room temperature superconductivity (~ 250 K) in laser-heated La-H mixtures between 135 GPa and 200 GPa. While the predicted LaH10 phase with a high superconducting temperature (Tc) was reported to have been observed, both resistivity and powder X-ray diffraction measurements reveal highly inhomogeneous samples with numerous unknown phases. To properly understand the high Tc detected in La-H samples, it is vital to structurally identify all phases present. The here proposed investigation aims at unambiguously solving the crystal structure of all crystalline solids observed in laser-heated La-H mixtures between 135 GPa and 180 GPa by employing the submicronic and high intensity X-ray beam of ID11 to perform single crystal X-ray diffraction on the resulting polycrystalline La-H samples. This crucial investigation will enable the complete understanding of the ultra-high Tc measurements in La-H mixtures. This proposal aimed at exploiting the submicron and ultra-high flux X-ray beam provided by the ID11 beamline to 1) produce a high spatial resolution XRD map of laser-heated La-H samples between 130 and 180 GPa, 2) identify the position of the best La-H crystallites of unknown phases and 3) unambiguously solve their crystal structure by collecting high-quality single crystal X-ray diffraction data. This study, solely possible on the ID11 beamline, is pivotal for the understanding of the exceptional Tc measured from La-H mixtures. BX90 diamond anvil cells with 80 \u03bcm culets were prepared. Lanthanum pieces in paraffin oil (CnH2n+2) were loaded in diamond anvil cells. Due to the small sample cavity, the known equation of state of the rhenium gasket along with the first order vibrational mode of diamond were used as in-situ pressure gauges. The samples were precompressed to the targetted pressures (> 140 GPa) and laser-heated above 2000 K at our home laboratory in Bayreuth. Necessary arrangement had been made to have access to a laser-heating setup at the ESRF, although that setup has a larger beamsize than the one employed at our home institute. Further compressing and laser-heating of some of these samples at the ESRF resulted in diamond anvil failure. Despite the sanitary situation, two team members were able to go work onsite. X-ray diffraction maps of all samples were collected and revealed diffraction lines belonging to pure La, diamond powder formed following the decomposition of heated paraffin, and of many other phases. On the best positions, single-crystal X-ray diffraction datasets were acquired in order to determine the crystal structure of these other phases. At 140 and 176 GPa, the unit cell of the LaH10 compound, was unambiguously identified. This single-crystal data confirms the reported powder X-ray diffraction data.  The next weeks will enable to more fully assess the quality of the collected single-crystal data. The single-crystal reflections are very intense, which is very impressive given the sample and beamsize. Nonetheless, having a crystal domain properly positioned on the center of rotation of the rotational stage is not trivial; despite a very careful centering procedure. As it stands, the best strategy appears to be to collect single-crystal datasets until a single domain, upon preliminary analysis appears to be perfectly centered. While a time-expensive approach, it is essential to obtain the best possible data. In any case, the beamtime was undoubtedly a great success and truly shows how much the ID11 has improved due to the EBS-ESRF. ",

For that purpose, X-ray diffraction collected in diamond anvil cells under high pressure and temperature and subsequent single\/polycristal analysis will be carried out. This aims at an understanding of the mesoscale mechanisms of these transformations, as well as a better control of microstructures of high pressure phases and materials, for fundamental and technological applications. -Results and conclusions of the study-Three diamond anvils cells (DAC), shortly described in Table  In previous runs, we proved the possibility of synthesizing \uf065-Fe single crystals of good quality using \uf061\uf02d\uf03e\uf067\uf02d\uf03e\uf065 transitions instead of \uf061\uf02d\uf03e\uf065 transition [HC-2783,HC-2180,HC-3402]. One difficulty to use these single crystals for fine measurements (such as IXS) is their small size (<20 \uf06dm). We tried to increase it by multiple crossing of < the \uf061\uf02d\uf067 transition line, as this procedure is described in the literature. We performed two \ud835\udefc \ud835\udefe cycles and then increased the pressure in the stability domain of \uf065-Fe (see Figure  A martensitic transformation produces large elastic stresses that is released with twinning and\/or dislocation generation; the plasticity mechanism, which is favoured by the system, has a large impact on the microstructure formed by the transformation. In previous works, we have evidenced that dislocation generation is a major phenomenon in \uf061-Fe<->\uf065-Fe transitions  In Titanium, \ud835\udefc (hcp) to \ud835\udf14 (hexagonal) phase transition induces an unusual grain enlargement, not understood yet  880 840 800 760 720 680 640 600 560 520 480 440 400 360 320 14.0 12.0 10.0 8.0 6.0 Pressure (GPa) \u03b1-Fe \u03b3-Fe \u03b5-Fe FeFoil1 One unexpected output of the experiment is the large effect of sample microstructure on the transition conditions. Titanium \uf061\uf020\uf0e0\uf077 transition onset depends on the starting crystal quality: from 8 GPa for an undeformed crystal to 16 GPa for a deformed crystal (see Figure  -Justification and comments about the use of beam time-After alignment of the beamline and calibration by the local contact on the first day, the beam time was used to stabilize P-T conditions in the DAC and collect data for the three cells. The experiment went smoothly; we appreciated the very small spot size of the beamline and the fast and sensitive detector and the accurate sample holder motors. Data analysis takes time because new methods\/programs need to be established\/written to treat the new h5 data format. -References-",

    "title":"Probing the spin polaron excitations in electron-doped cuprates",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"A recent breakthrough in the understanding of charge dynamics in cuprates is the discovery and characterization of the three-dimensional plasmon in electron-doped superconductors. This, however, represents only one of the two types of collective charge modes in the cuprates. As well as the three- dimensional plasmon, t-J model calculations also predict the presence of a spin polaron excitation, which is a lower energy mode that arises from the formation of a narrow polaronlike band of spin correlation dressed bosons. This proposal will use Cu L-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of La2-xCexCuO4 (LCCO) to discover the spin polaron excitation and characterize its momentum and doping dependence. The properties of this mode will provide critical information about the unconventional electron liquid that hosts high-temperature superconductivity, how it interacts with spin correlations and deepen our understanding of the t-J model and its validity.

These fascinating properties emerge from the nonzero Berry curvature in the inverse triangular antiferromagnetic structure on the Kagome lattice of Mn atoms (Fig.  The nonzero Berry curvature is attributed to the existence of local cluster multipole moments (Fig.  After the tuning of beamline conditions, the total energy resolution of 24 meV (in FWHM) was achieved, which enabled us to detect low-energy magnetic excitations. Within the allocated beamtime, we have collected RIXS data with s polarization for q = (H, 0) and (H, H) paths at 300 K, and with p polarization for q = (H, 0) and (H, H) paths at 300 K and 200 K. We spent more time for the p polarization as it suppresses the charge elastic scattering and made the inelastic signal more visible. As a representative set of experimental data, we show in Figure  To summarize, despite the small bandwidth of magnetic excitations and broad lineshape of the metallic Mn3Sn, the experiment has been successfully completed thanks to the ultrahigh resolution of ERIXS around the Mn L3 edge. Detailed data analysis for the extraction of magnon dispersion is under way. In particular, the differentiation of magnon dispersion taken with 300 and 200 K will give us insight into the two topologically distinct magnetic phases, which will be the main focus of the forthcoming publication. As mentioned in the proposal, we also aim to perform a further RIXS experiment under uniaxial stress, as the strain tuning of magnetism has proven to be effective ",

    "title":"Probing the low-energy orbital texture of Mott insulating Ca2RuO4",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Spin-orbit coupled systems display a rich variation of intricate quantum matter phases. The Mott insulating states of Sr2IrO4 and Ca2RuO4 are thought to be triggered by a combination of electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling. In Ca2RuO4, where spin-orbit coupling has a comparable energy scale to the crystal field splitting's, neutron scattering has successfully probed dispersive single magnon excitations. However, neutron scattering does not provide insight into the orbital character of these excitations. It is widely believed that interactions responsible for the Mott insulating state are encoded into this orbital texture. With the improvements provided by the ERIXS spectrometer, it is now possible to probe both orbital and spin excitations simultaneously in Ca2RuO4. We therefore propose to study the low-energy spin-orbital excitation spectrum of Ca2RuO4 via the oxygen K-edge at which ID32 delivers an energy resolution just below 30 meV.\r\n processes. As is shown in Fig.  Data obtained from this beamtime have been included in a manuscript that is currently under review at npj Quamtum Materials. A preprint has been submitted to the arXiv (K. von Arx, Q. Wang et al., arXiv: 2206.06695). The abstract of this manuscript is attached below. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, stripe order refers broadly to a coupled spin and charge modulation with a commensuration of eight and four lattice units, respectively. How this stripe order evolves across optimal doping remains a controversial question. Here we present a systematic resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of weak charge correlations in La2-xSrxCuO4 and La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4. Ultrahigh energy resolution experiments demonstrate the importance of the separation of inelastic and elastic scattering processes. Upon increasing doping x, the long-range temperature dependent stripe order is found to be replaced by short range temperature independent correlations at a critical point xc \u2248 0.15 distinct from the pseudogap critical doping. We argue that the doping and temperature independent short range correlations originate from unresolved electron-phonon coupling that broadly peaks a the stripe ordering vector. In La2-xSrxCuO4, longrange static stripe order vanishes around optimal doping and we discuss both quantum critical and crossover scenarios ",

    "title":"Local structure of glassy GeO2 at Mbar pressure conditions",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Understanding the structural response of network-forming glasses to pressure is of great interest for condensed matter physics, geoscience and materials science. Silica (SiO2) and germania (GeO2) are prototype network-forming glasses. Recently a large debate is emerging about atomic coordination of these glasses under extreme compression as some experimental and theoretical works have reported that the coordination in glassy phases could exceed that of their crystalline counterparts in the 40-100 GPa range.\r\nTherefore, we propose here to address this issue by investigating the local structure of glassy GeO2 by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy up to the Mbar range (150 GPa) and compare it to that of rutile GeO2.\r\n The goal of this proposal was to characterize the pressure induced structural transitions of glassy GeO2 using EXAFS technique. For this purpose, we have employed diamond anvil cells equipped with nanopolycristalline diamonds (NPDs) to obtain unprecedented high-quality glitch-free EXAFS data up to 161 GPa and a k-range of 16 \u00c5 -1 at the beamline BM23 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Germanium oxide (GeO2) GeO2 represents a structural analog of SiO2, which in turn is a major compound of industrial materials and the main constituent of silicate melts in Earth's interior. Studying structural properties of SiO2 glass at high-pressure conditions remains however challenging due to the high signal absorption of highpressure devices such as the diamond anvil cell. Local structural changes of GeO2 glass can be in turn easily probed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) coupled to the diamond anvil cell equipped with NPDs, which presents an ideal probe to investigate subtle changes of the local atomic arrangements  Two high-pressure X-ray absorption experiments were performed at Ge K-edge. For run1, the sample was loaded in a hole of 50 \u03bcm 2 drilled in a Re gasket and placed in a diamond anvil cell, equipped with two NPDs of 150 \u03bcm culet size. The first run was conducted up to 161 GPa and the sample was loaded without pressure transmitting medium. In the second run a polished glass piece of GeO2 was loaded together with neon as pressure transmitting medium in a DAC equipped with NPDs of 250 \u03bcm cullet size. The run2 was conducted up to 40 GPa. The high-quality EXAFS data obtained at BM23 allow extracting information on the first and second shells (neighbors) including distances, coordination number, Debye-Waller factor for the pairs Ge-O and Ge-Ge. Selected EXAFS functions [k 3 \u03c7(k)] for glassy GeO2 under quasi-hydrostatic compression at different pressures are shown in Fig. ",

Such nanocomposites based on semiconductor nanoparticles in a glass matrix are sought-after for laser technology, in solar cell industry and as natural light sources.

Here, a SiO2-Na2O-ZnO glass matrix was chosen, since it offers the unique possibility to slow the nanoparticle formation kinetics, which is in the micro-and millisecond range in wet environments like solutions, down to minutes or even hours. Furthermore, these nanoparticle-glass composites are primary candidates for future optical applications  In the present experiment, pre-synthesized ultra-thin glasses were studied at beamline ID02 using SAXS and WAXS simultaneously to track any structural changes on the atomic and nanometer scale. Each sample was heated to 610 \u00b0C using a heating ramp of 600 \u00b0C\/min. Upon heating the samples past the glass temperature of the matrix, the Cd and S ions gain mobility and the nanoparticle nucleation starts. With the desired higher annealing times, the mobility further increased and allowed the controlled time-dependent observation of very small nanoparticles and their subsequent agglomeration in the same experimental set-up. The data acquisition rate for each sample was in the minutes range and was continued for several hours. In total two glass samples with different initial concentrations of Cd and S ions were measured at 580 and 610 \u00b0C. As a reference and for the correct background subtraction, a complete data set of the pure glass matrix was measured as well. To prevent beam damage as much as possible and investigate the homogeneity of each sample, the beam position was shifted constantly during the experiments. All detector images were already azimuthally averaged by the beamline staff using their software. At the moment, a script for batch processing of all data sets including the correct background subtraction, scaling on absolute intensities and data modelling is prepared. Even the pure scattering curves already clearly indicate the formation of small nuclei and nanoparticles for temperatures larger than the glass temperature of the matrix (see figure  During data analysis using custom-made procedures, the shape and internal structure (density and crystallinity) of the nanoparticle will be visible and the results will be published in an upcoming research paper, which will bridge the gap in the literature between commonly used theoretical approaches and experimental data of the nucleation and further growth processes of semiconductor nanoparticles.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The aim of this proposal is to use X-ray fluorescence holography experiments to provide insight into the positional and chemical disorder of an icosahedral quasicrystal and an appoximant crystal in the Cd-Mg-Tb system.\r\nThis technique provides unique advantages as a tool to investigate the structure of quasicrystals, particularly because it can directly visualize the local 3-dimensional atomic scale structure in physical space, without being impeded by the phase problem of traditional crystallography. \r\nThe setup for this experiment is well established, and preliminary computer simulations have already been performed to establish a reference frame for the experimental results.  In this proposal, we planned to study the local atomic structure of a Cd-Mg-Tb icosahedral quasicrystal with X-ray fluorescence holography (XFH) with atomic-scale resolution. The aim was to elucidate the role of atomic disorder for the magnetic properties of the material. As a method, XFH can directly visualize the local 3-dimensional (3D) atomic scale structure in physical space, without being impeded by the phase problem of traditional crystallography. This renders XFH unique as a tool to investigate the structure of quasicrystals. We brought 2 sets of samples, i.e. quasicrystals and a two approximant crystals, for which the quality was confirmed beforehand. Unexpectedly however, we detected only a rather small signal (about 1 order of magnitude lower than expected from previous measurements), which was possibly related to the small sample and beam sizes and\/or the low energy of the Tb L\uf061 fluorescence. Therefore, it was necessary to change the sample system. We chose to continue our investigation of the decagonal Al-Co-Ni quasicrystalline system (Co and Ni holograms), for which we already measured initial data in a previous beamtime. Now, we were able to extend these measurements by higher energy holograms, which will provide an increased resolution for the real-space reconstructions and a improved reliability of the signals, which highly benefits the structural characterization of such complex (aperiodic) systems. Decagonal quasicrystals such as the investigated Al-Co-Ni are described by a periodic stacking of quasiperiodic planes. Although their structure might seem simpler to tackle, there are still the subject of current studies because most of the decagonal phases display a significant amount of disorder, seen as diffuse scattering in the diffraction pattern and are ternary intermetallic compounds ",

    "title":"Influence of strains in the occurrence and on the dynamics of the Verwey phase transition in magnetite",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"In this proposal we will investigate the influence of strains in the metal-insulator phase transition (the Verwey transition) of the canonical compound, magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$).  We have shown that strains, either intrinsic or externally induced, have a clear influence in the dynamics of the electronic orderings (see Figure of this proposal) as well as in the electronic phase separation below the metal-insulator transition. A picture of the extent and location of these strains is clearly missing. We firmly believe that the new microcopy recently installed at ID06 will help elucidate these matters. The aim of the experiment was to determine the influence of intrinsic strains on the metal-insulator first order phase transition, the Verwey transition (VT), in magnetite. Magnetite is a canonical compound, where strong electron-electron and electron-phonon [1] interactions cause the phase transformation at TV \u2248 124 K. VT is manifested in anomalies of principal physical quantities, like heat capacity, dynamical susceptibility (\uf063AC), electrical resistivity and crystal symmetry change from cubic Fd3m to low-T monoclinic Cc.

Capturing the evolution of the internal texture of both samples above, in the vicinity and below TV was a crucial part of the conducted experiment. Our plans were to first observe the crystal lattice quality (by mosaicity and strain mapping) at 300 K and correlate it with identical experiments below the Verwey transition. Although the first part was partially successful, it required long time and only initial observation was performed below TV for only one sample. Therefore, we would like to apply for additional beamtime in future. \uf063AC was used to measure the Verwey temperature (see. Fig.  Departures from the ideal crystal structure are inherent in low-T phase of magnetite, where Cc structure naturally forces the occurrence of crystal domains. Therefore, the studies of VT vs. intrinsic strain\/mosaicity should be done below TV; this was our initial goal of the presented studies and this is what we want to achieve in follow-up studies. There were good reasons that our goal was only partially achieved. First, more time than expected in a first place was spent in the Room Temperature (RT) studies. Since we needed three changes of LN2 cryostream due to vacuum issues that prevented us from getting to the transition temperature, and one cryostream refill, several hours were dedicated to the cryostream change requiring addition a temperature ramps. Dismounting a cryostream required removing the sample from the goniometer, hence leading to the need of realignment and scanning of the RT state of the sample for reference. The GE varnish did not hold the sample as nicely as expected, leading to additional remounts and realignments. Beamline experienced pco-edege camera crashed overnight cutting some of our programmed scans that needed to be repeated, and a computer crashed on the morning of Saturday that lead to 2-3h of standy for rebooting. In the same manner some scans were interrupted by electron beam loss. All these unwanted events resulted in at least 4 shifts losts, a number that could be much larger had it not been the help of ID6 beamline Staff.",

    "title":"Looking for pair density waves in YBa2Cu3O7-x via RIXS",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The saga of HTS has been recently enriched by the detection of the pair density wave (PDW) order. Such emerging order characterized by Coopers pairs with finite momentum has been directly observed for the first time by STM in 2016. In agreement with theory, STM experiments determined the PDW wavelength to be twice that of CDW. However a modulation with a wavevector Q=Q_CDW\/2  has not been observed by X-ray scattering experiments so far.\r\nA recent RIXS measurement on underdoped YBCO seems to solve this contradiction: by isolating the quasi-elastic contribution of the RIXS spectra along the (H,0) direction from the background, we revealed both a CDW peak at  Q_CDW\u22480.32 rlu and a second peak at Q\u2248Q_CDW\/2.\r\nHere we propose to study with RIXS the latter peak, as function of temperature T and doping p, in YBCO thin films. The T and p evolution of the peak will tell us if this peak is the long-searched PDW peak, possibly giving hints on its connection with the CDW and the SC states. The doping-temperature phase diagram of cuprate high critical temperature superconductors (HTS) is populated by several symmetry-breaking orders, whose intertwining and competition is considered the key to solve the grand unresolved issues of this class of materials. Some of these orders, as spin density waves (SDW) and charge density waves (CDW) have been disclosed and investigated by many experiments performed in the last two decades. Others instead, even though have been theoretically predicted, still remains inaccessible or experimentally elusive. This is the case of as the pair density wave (PDW) order, a new state of matter with unique properties not encountered in other superconductors. Such emerging order should be characterized by Coopers pairs having a finite momentum Q and therefore generating states with spatially modulating Cooper pair density  Up to now the evidence for the existence of PDW came first, indirectly, by transport experiments on 214 cuprates at doping p=1\/8  A recent test we have performed at ID32 on a strongly underdoped (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 0 = 12 K) YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 (YBCO) thin film gave us an indication of the presence of PDW and of its detectability with X-rays. By integrating the quasi elastic region of the RIXS spectra measured along the (H,0) direction, we disclosed both a charge order peak at qCDW\u22480.32 rlu and a second peak at c. We have achieved this, by properly subtracting the intensity coming from the specular centered at \u0393=(0,0), which covers any small signal below q=0.2 rlu. Based on the aforementioned test, we have decided to investigate, in the framework of the experiment HC4607, this second peak at low momentum value q 2nd in YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 (YBCO) thin films covering a broad range of doping. The usage of several doping levels is crucial to determine the doping range where the second peak is present: this can be crucial to understand the pairing mechanism of PDW and its intertwining with the charge order phenomenon. We have performed Cu-L3 RIXS measurements on three superconducting YBCO samples, grown at Chalmers University  As a first step, for each sample we have investigated the presence of a peak at qCDW\/2 in the quasi elastic region of the spectra (energy range between -40 meV and 100 meV), measured at several momentum values q\/\/ along the (H,0) direction of the Brillouin zone. The background signal, used to properly remove the specular intensity, has instead determined measuring the spectra along the (H,H) direction, and integrating the quasi-elastic region. The measurements have been performed at two\/three temperatures between 20 and 260 K. A summary of the results we have obtained at 20 K in presented in Figure  On the undoped CCO sample (Fig.  Based on the abovementioned result, we have performed on the strongly underdoped YBCO an azimuthal scan in the range between \u03c6 = 0 (H0 direction) and \u03c6 = 45 (HH direction) at two different values of momentum: q = 0.15 \u2248 q 2nd , where we have indication of a putative PDW signal, and at q = 0.44, i.e. far from both the PDW peak and the CDF peak. We expect indeed that the presence of many entangled, symmetry-breaking orders in this sample may be at the origin of a (multi)-folded Brillouin zone. Consequently, that in the chosen azimuthal range the intensity of the collective excitations to which we have access in the RIXS spectra might present a series of discontinuities. While the quasi-elastic intensity changes rather smoothly as a function of \u03c6, the intensity of the dd excitations (determining integrating the spectra in the range between -3 and -1 eV) undergoes unexpected jumps, superimposed to a smoother behavior (Fig.  The results presented in Figures 2 are preliminary and will require additional beamtime to be devoted specifically to this issue. The results based on the (H,0) and (H,H) scan, partially summarized only at one temperature in Figure  This very first experiment confirmed the actual existence of the qCDW\/2 peak in YBCO. The dataset we have collected, and in particular the doping dependence we have determined, will provide to us, after careful analysis, indications on the actual PDW nature and on its relation to the CDW order.

The same technique has uncovered the existence of the pseudogap, i.e., a larger energy gap affecting only a fraction of the Fermi surface up to the temperature T*>>Tc. Less direct signatures of the pseudogap have been found in measurements other than ARPES, but the determination of T* is there not univocal. This is a problem in materials where ARPES cannot be performed, such as YBCO. We propose to use very high resolution RIXS to study the opening of the superconducting gap and of the pseudogap in YBCO. The sensitivity of RIXS to the gap opening has been recently demonstrated for BSCCO, for which ARPES and Raman spectroscopy were used as reference. We propose to use RIXS for the important case of the gaps of YBCO, with the goal of determining T*.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The superconductivity in tri-layer cuprate Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x (Bi2223) is intriguing, not only because it has the highest Tc,max (~110K) among Bi-family, but also the Tc shows a negligible reduction with overdoping. This is very surprising since this obviously violates the Tc dome that is deemed a universal trend for cuprates. However, there is still no consensus on why the Tc is so robust in the overdoped Bi2223. Here we propose to use the high resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to examine the T-dependence of charge excitations and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in optimally and overdoped Bi2223, which are reported to entangle with the superconducting phase of cuprates. The aim is to determine their correlations with the robust high Tc and find out the essential factor for the high Tc superconductivity in Bi2223. The answer can reveal the nature of the highest Tc in tri-layer cuprates and provide insights on how to raise Tc. reference details.

    "title":"Superionic water at high pressures and temperatures",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The aim of this proposal is to explore the structural properties and P-T boundaries of the superionic phases of water, as a continuation of our previous runs HC-2185 and HC-3952. In run HC-2185, using CO2 laser heating, we were able to determine the melting curve of water up to 45 GPa and evidence the transition to the superionic bcc ice [1]. In run HC-3952 we extended the investigated pressure range to 166 GPa using YAG laser heating and observed the bcc-fcc transition at two pressures, 100 and 166 GPa. The aim of the present proposal is to map in more details the bcc-fcc transition line from 50 to 200 GPa and extend the melting line measurement of superionic ice up to 200 GPa. This will allow us to extract the thermodynamics of each phase transition from which it can be determined the molecular or superionic nature. Warm dense water ice is at the center of a great interest due the unusual properties of its superionic (SI) phases and to its rich polymorphism. These newly discovered phases stability regions and thermodynamic properties are needed to accurately model planetary interiors. The protonic mobility associated to superionic state should play a role in the magnetic field of icy giant planets such as Uranus and Neptune  Five diamond anvil cells were prepared: one with 300 \u00b5m anvil culet diameters, two with 150 \u00b5m, one with 100 \u00b5m and one with 70 \u00b5m. Each anvils were first machined by focused ion beam (FIB) with a central circular pit to provide sufficient space for the boron-doped diamond heaters on both sides of the sample cavity. 1.5 \u00b5m-thick Al 2 O 3 layers were deposited on each anvil to provide thermal insulation between the C:B heaters and the diamond anvils. Then, C:B heaters were installed on each anvils and fixed using a sub-micrometer thin layer of UV curing glue. Pure H 2 O was loaded in the DACs cavity, and samples were characterized using Raman spectroscopy. Figures  Samples were studied on the ID27 beamine at the ESRF under two-side YAG laser heating while temperature was measured by optical pyrometry. During X-ray diffraction recording, care was taken to balance temperatures at both sides of the sample and to keep it as stable as possible. Temperature increments of 100 K were used for accurate determination of the boundary line, performing both ascending and descending temperature ramps. A large number of X-ray diffraction data could be collected at various pressure ranging from 30 GPa to 200 GPa. The transition from ice X to fcc-SI could be unambigously observed with more than 3 reflexions from the novel fcc-SI phase up to 200 GPa with excellent quality data as visible in figure  We are currently analysing the data in details in order to refine the boundary line between ice X and the fcc-SI. Since we have been able to finely track the evolution of the fcc-SI phase reflexions with increasing temperature beyond the boundary line, we will be able to extract thermodynamic properties of the fcc-SI such as volume jumps at transition and thermal expansion as planned. Data should also provide interesting information on the transition kinetics. ",

    "title":"Studying anisotropies in vapor-deposited metallic glasses",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to continue our investigation of the structural anisotropies in bulk metallic glasses with X-ray nano-diffraction. Our initial experiment at ID16B revealed large and unexpected structural anisotropies discovered by analyzing the full 2D diffraction pattern. The patterns showed large intensity variations as a function of the azimuthal angle. The results of the studies we propose on several samples with different growth conditions and degrees of stability can inform the relationship between the observed anisotropies and important properties of metallic glasses, pointing to the need to have structural information beyond the density-density pair distribution function.  Further, these studies may provide new information relevant to the glass transition, a long-standing open question in condensed matter physics. The experiment was done with the nano-diffraction setup at ID13. The beamsize was determined to be around 70nm \uf0b4 70nm using a Siemens star. The samples are metallic glasses produced via vapor deposition at controlled substrate temperatures. The compositions include Pd77.5Cu6Si16.5 (at.%) and Zr50Cu50 (at.%). All samples are a few micrometers thick and free-standing, allowing for measurements with a simple transmission geometry. The scans are mainly done over a 2D regular grid on the sample, with various step sizes on the order of 100 nm to 1 \u03bcm. Anisotropy in PdCuSi -One of the main goals of the experiment was to confirm the existence of local anisotropies in the PdCuSi sample. This goal has been achieved. In Figure  The anisotropies around the ring appears to reach \uf0b16%, which is surprising for the following reasons. Since no sharp peaks can be seen in the diffraction images, the ordered regions in the sample should not exceed ~2 nm in size. Thus, in the probed sample volume of ~70nm \uf0b4 70nm \uf0b4 5\u03bcm, there should be no less than 3\uf0b410 6 of ordered regions. Random fluctuations in the orientation of such a large number of regions cannot reach a level of \uf0b16%. Therefore, some kind of long-range ordering must be present in the sample, which is surprising given that the sample appears completely amorphous.  We have further investigated the sample by annealing at 356 \u2103 and 366 \u2103 for 10 minutes. The results of the same analysis as for the as-deposited sample are presented on the second and third row of Figure  Structural inhomogeneities in ZrCu -During the experiment, we also investigated two vapor-deposited ZrCu samples: one deposited at room temperature (smaple #1), and another deposited with the substrate at 242 \u00b0C (sample #2), while other parameters for deposition were kept the same. These ZrCu samples did not exhibit the kind of anisotropy observed in the PdCuSi sample. Instead, we found significant structural inhomogeneities in sample #2 but not sample #1. These inhomogeneities showed up as fluctuations in the Q position of the diffraction maximum from its median value during the scan, i.e., (\ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc5a -\ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc5a median )\/\ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc5a median ; see Figure  This is an intriguing and somewhat surprising finding because the samples deposited at elevated temperatures were found to show enhanced mechanical homogeneity ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Our most recent experiments on ID09 support a scheme whereby the macroscopic volume expansion and spin state switching are separated in time. Such behaviour is different from the expectation that phase transformation only requires atomic displacements in the unit cell, that can occur simultaneously with propagation of a volumic strain.  SCO molecules instead remain trapped by local energy barriers separating low spin and high spin states. The observed delay between the volume increase (caused predominantly by lattice heating) and the macroscopic switching may be an indication of a cooperative process during phase separation that takes longer than the switching of independent molecules. This finding motivates an optimised material design, scalable with size dependent dynamics and intrinsic energetics. Here, we propose to study nanocrystals undergoing molecular spin transition in a form of oriented thin films, and exhibiting negligibly small thermal expansion.

    "title":"Sm valence and closure of the correlation gap in the Kondo insulator SmB6",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The aim of the present proposal is to probe Sm Valence and magnetic state across the magnetic field induced closure of the correlation gap. In resistivity measurements, the closure has been observed at 89 T. It has also been shown, that the correlation gap inferred from resistivity measurements can be reduced through through the application of pressure at a rate of -0.7meV\/GPa. We therefore use pressure to reduce and tune the gap, and pulsed high magnetic fields up to 30T in order to reach the expected closure. Previous measurements at ambient pressure and pressures up to 1.9 GPa did not show a significant evolution of the Sm valence contrary to expectations. In this continuation we therefore aim to corroborate this observation and to extend our measurements to higher pressures. The main objective of experiment HC4723 was to confirm previous results and to further investigate the field induced closure of the resistivity gap by direct valence measurements using XAS. The idea was to reduce the critical field lower than 30 T by tuning the gap under high pressure, and perform field dependent XAS measurements at low temperatures (within the insulating phase) to observe a possible increase of vSm, as the signatures of field induced gap-closure. A second objective was to probe the magnetic state of the sample via XMCD. We measured field dependent XAS measurements at 1.6 GPa. Sm L3-edge XAS data have been collected along the rising and falling slops of 30 T field pulses, at several different temperatures starting from 100 K down to 60 K (with a 10 K step, approximately). An exemplary set of field dependent XAS obtained at 77 K is reported in Fig.  As one can see from In Fig.  Following above mentioned procedures, we obtained vSm for all field values along each field pulse. An exemplary vSm vs. field plot is given in Fig.  We did not find significant valence change in pulsed magentic field up 30 T, at different We attempted to obtain XMCD data, but unfortunately the quality was not sufficient to detect the small expected signal. One possible explanation is a combination of (i) the enhanced spatial coherence of the EBS, (ii) a periodic slope error of the (old) horizontal mirror, and (iii) small (periodic) variations in source position. This ultimately leads to a failure of the normalization procedure of the spectra image and also in the evaluation of difference spectra. We understood that ID24 is planning to replace the mirror in order to mitigate the issue. At the same time ID24 offered support to attempt to exploit the data through correlation with a (temporally) large set of I0 acquisitions. This numerical approach is based on the assumption of a periodic temporal pattern or modes in the variation of the source position.",

    "title":"Metamagnetic transition in size-selected FeRh B2 nanocrystals",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Near equiatomic composition, FeRh bulk alloys exhibit a CsCl-type (B2) chemically ordered phase related to a metamagnetic transition from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) to a ferromagnetic (FM) state close to ambient. This first order metamagnetic transition is generally interpreted in terms of the collapse of induced Rh magnetic moment at low temperature. The objective of this proposal is to study thermally driven chemical order transition and magnetism in bi-metallic FeRh nanoalloys. To reach this purpose, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism (XAS\/XMCD) experiments on ID12 will be performed at both Fe K-edges and Rh L-edges on in-situ UHV annealed mass-selected FeRh nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in amorphous carbon matrix. These results will allow us to describe local structural and magnetic evolution for each specific element as a function of FeRh clusters size.   FeRh clusters were produced in gas phase with two different diameters 3 and 7 nm by Mass-Selected Low Energy Cluster Beam Deposition (MS-LECBD) in UHV chamber on different substrates. While as-prepared NPs are in the chemically disordered fcc A1 phase with a paramagnetic like-behaviour, UHV annealing around 900K leads systematically to chemical ordering for FeRh nanocrystal towards the B2 phase with strong magnetic signature. Notice that Epitaxy has been recently observed on thin film of mass-selected FeRh clusters (in the 3-10 nm range in diameter) deposited on STO substrate (see experimental report A32-3-745 on BM32 beamline) while thick FeRh nanogranular sample (with diameter greater than 30 nm) present a broad metamagnetic transition with applied magnetic field dependence for transition temperature and a global few tens per cent of residual magnetization at low temperature (unpublished SQUID magnetometry measurements). Preliminary XANES Measurements have been performed on a dozen of samples in Fluorescence and Total electron yield at both Fe K-edges (7.13 keV with HE 52 undulator) and Rh L-edges (3.14 keV with HE 38 undulator) by using normal, grazing incidence and Silicon Drift Detector (no filter) in view to optimize experimental conditions to extract significant XMCD signal from our various bimetallic nanostructures. For all the samples, we systematically found that Fluorescence signal is better in grazing incidence (10-20\u00b0) than in normal configuration to avoid Bragg peaks from substrates but also from B2 large nanocristallites in annealed 150nm-thick FeRh samples. Moreover the XAS signal is strongly improved by using the SDD detector as background decrease given the low quantity of absorbing atoms, especially for our thin samples with a few nm of equivalent FeRh thickness. Here, we report comparative XAS\/XMCD results obtained for 3 couples of samples mounted on a specific 15\u00b0 incidence sample holder in the vacuum cryomagnet chamber (up to 7 T in the 3k-320K temperature range): \uf0b7 Thick FeRh NPs samples on Si protected with C-capping (equivalent FeRh NPs thickness of 150 nm) TM1623 (annealed sample at 700\u00b0C) to compare to TM2121 (as-prepared sample) \uf0b7 Thin FeRh NPs with 7 nm in diameter on Si with C-capping (equivalent FeRh thickness of 3 nm) TM1639 (annealed sample at 700\u00b0C) and TM2219 (as-prepared sample) \uf0b7 Thin FeRh NPs with 3 nm in diameter on STO (equivalent FeRh thickness of 1nm) TM2109 (annealed sample at 600\u00b0C with C-capping) and TM2127 (annealed at 800\u00b0C without C-capping) First of all, we clearly obtained two different metallic XANES\/XMCD signatures at the Rh-L2,3 edges for all asprepared and annealed samples as-illustrated on the figure ",

    "title":"Tailoring the magnetism of 4f rare-earth atom lattices formed by metal-organic coordination",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"A single atom with long spin lifetime represents the prototype of the smallest bit for data storage. So far, single atom magnets have been obtained by adsorbing a 4f rare earth atom onto a well-defined site at surfaces, or by inserting it into custom-designed molecular frames. Here we propose a different approach. By combining atom adsorption at surfaces and 2D coordination with organic ligands, we aim at realizing a lattice of rare-earth single atom magnets with tunable magnetic properties. Coordination with tetraphenyl-dicarbonitrile molecules provides high-symmetry C5v crystal field, while the use of graphene as substrate minimizes spin-electron and spin-phonon scattering. The choice of the rare earth species, with oblate or prolate 4f charge distribution and different total angular moment J, determines the orientation of the magnetization easy axis and the spin lifetime. All the samples were prepared in-situ. The metal-organic structures were grown at room temperature by successive deposition of molecules and rare earth (RE) atoms onto the graphene\/Ir(111) surface. We used NC-Ph4-CN molecules as organic ligand, and Tb, Dy, Ho, Er as RE elements. For each RE, several samples have been prepared for coverage calibration purposes. Ideally, a surface completely covered by the metal-organic structures corresponds to a RE coverage of the order of 0.5% of ML, with 1 ML definced as 1 RE atom per graphene unit cell. XAS and XMCD were acquired at the RE M4,5 edges in order to access the electronic state of the RE and the L and S moments. We acquired XMCD spectra as a function of the incidence angle to investigate the easy magnetization axis and the magnetic field dependence of the XMCD intensity to investigate the magnetization reversal mechanism. Further, XMLD spectra provide additional information on the effect of the ligand field on the RE 4f charge distribution. The measurements were carried out at the lowest reachable temperature of ~6 K and magnetic fields up to 7 T. As mentioned in our feedback form, at least 4 out of the 18 allocated shifts were lost because of technical problems (computer failure, end station problems with cryogenic parts). In addition, the quality of the signal was not always satisfactory. In some cases, many more spectra had to be acquired to try to compensate for that. A preliminary analysis of the data obtained for the metal-organic structures formed by NC-Ph4-CN molecules and the RE atoms has been carried out. The results are summarized below. a) When included in the metal-organic structures, all the investigated elements display 4f n-1 electronic configuration, where the 4f n configuration is the one correponding to the atom in the gas phase. This is in contrast with what has been observed for most of the RE as isolated adatoms on the same surface: in fact, only Tb was found in the 4f n-1 configuration as adatom, while Dy, Ho and Er displayed 4f n configuration ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Pressure induced amorphous to amorphous transition in covalently bonded substances with open local structures have been extensively studied over the years. However, this is not the case for amorphous metallic glasses with closely packed local structures and high coordination numbers. Pressure induced local structural changes in these densely packed disordered systems and its correlation with the anomalous pressure behavior are still poorly understood. We aim to take a further step into this issue by investigating the pressure behavior of closely packed local structures in a simple system, binary Ni62Nb38 metallic glass. We propose to use EXAFS, an element selective technique and ideal probe of local structures in amorphous systems. The goal of the current project is to improve the current understanding on the pressure behavior of closely packed disordered systems, a matter of importance for basic and applied sciences. The phenomenon of amorphous-amorphous phase transitions (polyamorphism) has been investigated over the years, mostly in covalently bonded systems with open local structures, such as network forming SiO 2 and GeO 2 glasses  With these motivations, we have perform high pressure EXAFS measurements at the BM23 beamline of ESRF taking advantage of the highly stable energy scanning setp and focusing optics. High pressure EXAFS data have been measurement in transmission mode at both Ni (~8.333 eV) and Nb (~18.98 keV), along two independent runs. Nano-polycrystalline diamond (NPD) anvils of 200 \u03bcm culet have been used in order to obtain glitch free EXAFS data. Initially, samples have been loaded together with Ne pressure medium, however, sample loadings have been prematurely failed, possibly due to the Ne penetration into the microstructures of the NPD anvils. Thus measurements have been continued with new samples loadings with pressure medium of silicon oil. Ni and Nb K-edge EXAFS data have been measurements up to 71 and 60 GPa, respectively. Maximum pressures were limited to those values due to the perforated design of the anvils (also for Nb K-edge, because of the insufficient number of anvils). Selected high pressure EXAFS data at the Ni and Nb K edges are shown in Fig.  Quantitative EXAFS analysis are currently under progress in order to asses the details of the structural changes occurring in this glass under high pressure. Even-though no clear evidences of drastic structural modifications have been identified from the 1 st glance on the data, results of the on-going quantitative EXAFS analysis are still very important for grasping the behaviour of closely packed local structures under high pressure. A good quality article is expected to be published soon after the complete data analysis.",

They are of quantum-mechanicalnature, where overlap of n and pi* wavefunctions occurs along the trajectory which ensures the maximum orbital overlay. In some of the organic anhydride (OA)crystals, the intermolecular CC contacts along this trajectory are exceptionally short and direct the molecules for the nucleophilic addition reaction . We recently discovered a crystal structure distortion and dramatic change in C=O vibrational modes in pyromellitic dianhydride at high pressure. We associate it with intracrystal polymerization, as a result of an effective overlap of C=O groups. In this proposal, we aim to systematically study a series of simple maleic anhydride derivatives, using high-pressure X-ray diffraction technique, in order to derive general rules for pressure-driven condensation in OA crystals, depending on their electronic and supramolecular structure. Maleic anhydride (MA) and its derivatives are compounds of great commercial importance.

    "title":"Determination of nitrogen's phase diagram up to 400 GPa",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"As an archetypal diatomic molecule, the high-pressure polymorphs of molecular nitrogen are an excellent testbed for refining solid-state physics models. Above 110 GPa, the physicochemical properties of nitrogen radically change as it transforms into a polymeric single-bonded solid. It exhibits unique characteristics, such as the highest chemical energy storage and ultra-stiff bonds, compelling for the design of novel functional materials. This proposal aims to uncover nitrogen's phase diagram between 180 and 400 GPa, discover novel polymeric phases and solve their structure with single-crystal X-ray diffraction from polycrystalline samples (SC-XRDp). These experiments will challenge current theoretical models and unveil novel forms of polynitrogen arrangements, providing a rare, but crucial, example of the behavior of simple homoatomic systems at ultrahigh pressures. It must be emphasized that these planned experiments were very ambitious-though realistic-both regarding the samples' preparation as well as the beamline's performance. Regarding the latter, it must be emphasized that such experiments had not yet been attempted. To accomplish the objectives of this proposal, three toroidal diamond anvil cells (DAC), each with a culet size of 40x300 \uf06dm (DAC1), 40x300 \uf06dm (DAC2) and 60x300 \uf06dm (DAC3), were carefully prepared. This anvil geometry is now routinely used at the CEA to reach static pressures above 300 GPa. The DACs were loaded with N2 and precompressed to a pressure of ~150 GPa before arrival to the ESRF. Exceeding this pressure would have led to the nitrogen sample becoming completely opaque, preventing the alignment of ID27's YAG lasers employed for sample laser heating. However, with the nitrogen sample being transparent at 150 GPa, the YAG lasers could be properly prealigned on the sample before further pressure increase. At the beamline, upon running the single-crystal calibrant DAC and later the nitrogen toroidal DACs, a number of stability issues with the beamline were found. Amongst minor problems, sample motors and pinhole drift were also observed, precluding high-quality data to be obtained. Figure ",

Thus far, the binary systems' investigation for poly-N species was largely limited below 125 GPa, and never has the threshold above 200 GPa been breached\u2014although theoretical calculations predict even more exotic N chemical arrangements to be synthesized. This proposal aims to explore the terra incognita that is poly-N chemistry in the multimegabar regime by probing laser-heated Ca-N and Sr-N systems up to 240 GPa, employing the single-crystal X-ray diffraction from the polycrystalline samples (SC-XRDp) technique for structural determination. Of great fundamental physicochemical interest, the discovery of novel high pressure poly-N species is also indispensable as targets for lower pressure syntheses.  Experiments on Ca(N3)2+N2, on the other hand, resulted in the synthesis of four Ca-N phases, CaN5, \u03b1-CaN6, \u03b2-CaN6 and CaN8, with all but \u03b1-CaN6 being previously unobserved. Their structures, drawn in Figure  The decompression of these phases was initiated, but could not be completed within the allocated beamtime. With the synthesis of four phases, including three new, the beamtime was undoubtedly a great success. Future experiments will again attempt the investigation of the Sr-N system at very high pressures and complete the decompression of the CaN5, \u03b1-CaN6, \u03b2-CaN6 and CaN8 compounds.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"As an archetypal molecular system, oxygen is one of the most studied elements at high pressures and features a surprisingly complex solid-state behavior. Stable from 10 GPa, the \u03b5-O2 phase is comprised of exotic (O2)4 units, and transforms into the \u03b6-O2 polymorph above 96 GPa. Observed up to the highest pressure attained on oxygen, 134 GPa, this molecular, metallic, and superconducting phase is of the utmost importance for fundamental condensed matter physics and earth sciences. Even though the crystal structure of \u03b6-O2 is a prerequisite for its understanding, it could not be refined due to insufficient data quality. In this proposal, single-crystal X-ray diffraction of polycrystalline samples (SC-XRDp), coupled with the EBS-ESRF fuelled ID27 beamline's exceptional capabilities, will be employed to unambiguously solve the crystal structure of \u03b6-O2 and unveil the phase diagram of oxygen up to 200 GPa.\r\n\r\n As an archetypal molecular system, oxygen is one of the most studied elements at high pressures and features a surprisingly complex solid-state behavior.

Observed up to the highest pressure attained on oxygen, 134 GPa, this molecular, metallic, and superconducting phase is of the utmost importance for fundamental condensed matter physics and earth sciences. The main objectives of this proposal were to solve the currently unknown structure of \u03b6-O2-essential for the understanding its properties-employing singlecrystal X-ray diffraction and extend the phase diagram of oxygen from 134 GPa to 200 GPa Results BX90-type diamond anvil cells (DACs) were prepared to cover the pressure domain between 120 and 200 GPa. As detailed in the proposal, the culet of the diamond anvils was coated with a thin layer of MgO, planned to act as a chemical as well as a thermal insulator from the diamond anvils, and the cells were cryogenically loaded with O2. The DACs were precompressed to the targetted pressure of 130 GPa and laserheated at the University of Bayreuth. These DACs were then brought to the ID11 beamline of the ESRF for their characterization by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction. A full map of the experimental chamber encouragingly revealed well-defined singlecrystal X-ray diffraction spots, suggestive of the formation of a new phase that appeared to be distinctive of any known oxygen allotropes. High-quality single-crystal data was collected, and the corresponding structure was solved and refined. Unexpectedly, the synthesized solid was found to be an orthocarbonate with the Mg2CO4 stoichiometry (see Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to study nano-scale density inhomogeneities in metallic glasses (MGs) and how they relate to the stability and mechanical properties of the glasses, using nano-tomography at ID16A. Recent studies have shown that density inhomogeneities on the length scale of ~100nm and up to 20% in magnitude exist in melt-quenched MGs. On the other hand, a family of vapor-deposited MGs have been found to exhibit a greater stability and an enhanced mechanical uniformity, but it remains to be seen how their structure differs on the nanoscale. In particular, it is unknown whether density inhomogeneities exist in these ultra-stable MGs, and if so, what is the level and length scale. Phase-contrast X-ray tomography at ID16A is well suited to answer this question thanks to its capability to detect low-level electron density fluctuations. The results are relevant to both the physical nature of the glass transition and industrial applications based on the mechanical properties of MGs. The aim of the experiment is to investigate whether sub-micrometer density fluctuations exist in metallic glasses. This is motivated by the results reported in Ref.  During this beam time, we have performed nano-holotomography on different metallic glass samples at ID16A. The high stability and high resolution (down to 10 nm voxel size) are ideal for the purpose of our study. While analysis is still underway, we have obtained some preliminary results that may point to interesting behaviors in the samples. In particular, we show in Figure  However, further work is needed to exclude the possibility that our observations are artifacts arising from the measurement and\/or the analysis.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We have recently reported strong anomalous Hall effect in heterostructures of non-magnetic SrIrO3 (SIO) and ferromagnetic LaCoO3 (LCO) which demonstrated proximity-induced ferromagnetism in SIO. This has been demonstrated to arise from interfacial charge transfer from Ir to Co, which we propose to investigate further using detailed temperature dependent Ir L- edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at beam line ID12 on a selection of high quality SIO\/LCO heterostructures. Our aim is specifically to investigate the changes of the local electronic and magnetic structure of interfacial Ir ions, and in particular to check possible break-down of the pseudo-spin scenario. Additionally, we aim at gaining fresh insights at the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) \u2013 which is generally both of fundamental and technological interest - and its relation to oxygen octahedral rotations.  of the Ir L 2,3 XANES spectra is the sharp 'white-line' (WL) feature that corresponds to 2p \u2192 5d electronic transitions. The Ir L 2 -edge is sensitive to transitions involving 5d 3\/2 (i.e. J eff =3\/2) holes, while the L 3 -edge is related to both 5d 5\/2 (J eff =1\/2 and the crystal field e g manifolds) and 5d 3\/2 final states. Because the WL features are more pronounced at the L 3 edge than the L 2 edge, we can infer that these unoccupied 5d states are primarily 5d 5\/2 rather than 5d 3\/2 in nature, consistent with the almost completely filled J eff =3\/2 bands. The L 2,3 spectra display a systematic shift of spectral weight to higher energy and an increase of WL-Peak area with decreasing SIO layer thickness or number of SIO\/LCO interfaces per film. This indicates an increase of the t 2g -derived unoccupied density of states which is very likely related to an electron transfer from Ir 5d to Co 3d states at the interface. The charge transfer inherently results in a change of the chemical valence state of Ir. In Fig.  In summary, during the allocated beamtime we succesfully could adress to all the points raised in our proposal HC5007. A systematic change of the chemical valence state of Ir was observed with decreasing SIO layer thickness due to the interfacial charge transfer at the SIO\/LCO interface. Despite the large degree of epitaxial strain within the HSs, the observed BR was found to be nearly the same in all HSs indicating a SO coupled pseudospin ground state of the Ir. The Ir magnetic moment was found to be rather small, m t \u2248 0.018 \uf06dB, and parallel alligned with respect to the magnetic field demonstrating a FM coupling of the SIO and LCO layer at the interface.

We propose to use Fourier transform holography, with our recent developments towards magnetic tomography, to image the 3D structure of this new type of domain walls and compare the results with the published model. Samples were thus prepared by growing a 300 nm thick layer of permalloy by magnetron sputtering at ~400\u00b0C on a SiN membrane. The back side of the latter had previous been covered with a thick Au-Ti multilayer designed to be opaque to soft X-rays. 4 devices were etched in the permalloy layer, and FTH masks milled by FIB in the Au-Ti multilayer in front of the permalloy samples. One of them is shown in Figure  Compared to the previously existing set-up, we used 2 days to optimise a procedure to combine data with and without beamstop: special care was taken to reject harmonics, allowing to use a strong attuator (a 2.5 \u00b5m thick zinc film) for the measurement of the direct beam. This improved set-up to make quantitative measures, whereas approximations were needed without the direct beam measurements. For instance, the charge image now shows similar contrast to SEM (Figure  First the 4 devices were imaged in normal incidence, to try to identify those with the most interesting magnetic textures.

This is a unique phenomenon among reported TE materials; however, its origin remains highly debated. Several scenarios have been proposed among the most likely one, but not completely accepted, relates the low \u03baT to a highly anisotropy in the phonon scattering. This may be related to the Sn\u2013Se bond anharmonicity and anisotropy. This kind of information with a local character and dependence on the solid's vibrational properties could be only accessed by spectroscopies at local-range, as the case of EXAFS or Raman. We propose to study the bond anharmonicity and anisotropy in binary SnSe using high-quality EXAFS under isobaric condition in DAC and cryostat from 2 to 300 K at HP (100 GPa). These data will improve our knowledge on the features of the intrinsic low thermal conductivity in SnSe at non-ambient conditions and will have a high impact for further developments in thermoelectrics. different isothermal conditions were considered as an additional parameter for accessing different bond anharmonicity degrees. Changing the pressure also played an important role for further variations in bond anharmonicity and anisotropy, which improve the thermoelectric performance. EXAFS investigations were then conducted at different temperatures with high-quality data for allowing properly fittings of higher order cumulants, which are related to anharmonicity in the pair-potential (here, Sn-Se). The local atomic arrangement was probed using EXAFS measurements at the Sn K-edge up to a k-range of 17.5 \u00c5 -1 (Fig.  Data analysis is still in progress.

    "title":"Synthesis of novel YFe2H(x>10) compounds up to 100 GPa: a possibility to recover a high content H-storage material at ambient pressure",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Hydrogen uptake by a metal drastically increases under high hydrogen pressure. New polyhydrides compounds are interesting as H-storage materials and hold great promise as high temperature superconductors. Pressures in the 100 GPa range have to be applied and unfortunately none of these novel Metal-Hydrogen compounds is metastable at ambient pressure. Hence, there is now great interest to form such H-rich compounds at high pressure and to recover them at ambient pressure by adding a third element. The aim of this proposal is to show that searching for ternary hydrides is indeed a good strategy. We performed ab-initio calculations showing that YFe2H10 is predicted to form at about 20 GPa and that it could be recovered metastable at ambient pressure. YFe2 alloy will be compressed in excess hydrogen and the formation of YFe2Hx compounds will be characterized by a detailed structural study at various pressures. The metastability of the YFe2H at ambient pressure will be investigated. Under pressures of few tens of GPa, many elements have been predicted to form poly-hydrides with unconventionally high hydrogen stoichiometry. Interestingly, many of these superhydrides are predicted to have a conventional superconductivity, some with a remarkable almost ambient critical temperature  The experimental study of pressure-induced hydrides in FeH2 alloy seems a good candidate to demonstrate indeed the validity of the ternary hydride hypothesis. YFe2 has been observed to readily absorb hydrogen with almost continuous amount, leading to YFe2H5 above 0.1 GPa. Interestingly, YFe2H5 has been shown metastable at ambient pressure  Another aim is to go in the 100 GPa range to increase further the H content in YFe2Hx>10 and observe the transition from interstitial to reorganized hydrides. The two end-member components, Fe and Y, already formed very intriguing super-hydrides, namely FeH5 and YH6. The H sub-lattice in YFe2H>11 superhydride might be very interesting. DFT calculations are under progress to guide our experimental search. The goal of our experiment was the following: 1) use standard DACs to synthesize YFe2H(6 -10) by compressing YFe2H4.2 in excess hydrogen up to the 80 GPa range. Perform XRD determination of the structure, volume and hence observe the highest stoichiometry stable at a given pressure. Measure the volume upon decompression to show ambient pressure metastability. 2) Synthesize super-hydride of YFe2Hx by going above 100 GPa. Three diamond anvil cells were prepared covering various pressure range. YFe2H4,2 was loaded with an excess of hydrogen in the four DACs. A first cell mounted with diamonds with culets of 300\u00b5m was loaded with two pieces of YFe2H4,2. XRD measurements were performed up to 51 GPa, leading to an equation of state for YFe2Hx (see fig.  We investigated the metastability of YFe2H7 with another cell by decompressing it while taking XRD measurements. The decompression started at 30 GPa (see fig.  Another DAC, with culets of 150\u03bcm was loaded with YFe2H4.2, in order to investigate the formation of YFe2H10 at a higher pressure range, up to 90 GPa. XRD measurements were made but the results need more analysis. At first glance, there seems to be a mix of different phases. To conclude, in the present experiment we managed to form YFe2H7, to obtain complete structural data by measuring the single-crystal diffraction of this hydride, and to show that YFe2H7 is not metastable under ambient pressure. We now need to further explore the megabar pressure range in order to carefully investigate the formation of YFe2H10. A new proposal will be submitted to pursue this study.  ",

    "title":"Molecular-to-Atomic Transition in Solid Oxygen",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Oxygen is a unique element, with the only known molecular magnet and with very small compact valence orbitals allowing the short double chemical bond in the oxygen molecule. Remarkably, oxygen exhibits a richer phase diagram than other diatomic molecular systems. To date, the structural investigation of oxygen under pressure has been limited to 133 GPa and the structural characterization of the metallic transition about 100 GPa has been disclosed by single-crystal X-ray microdiffraction.  The structural evolution of metallic phase of solid oxygen and the possibility of inducing a molecular dissociation in the solid state remain totally unknown. With this proposal, we will explore to pressures exceeding 300 GPa, by single crystal X-ray microdiffraction, the phase stability of the metallic phase and uncover other possible phases and crystalline structures of very dense solid oxygen.  As pressure increases, solid oxygen shows a wide range of physical properties  The objectives of this research proposal regarding dense solid oxygen were as follows: re-examine the structure of \uf065-O2 and attempt to determine the structure of the \uf07a-phase, prevailing above 96 GPa. We also aimed at addressing other relevant questions: is the metallic phase of oxygen stable upon further densification? How does molecular bonding evolve and lead to yet unknown denser crystalline phases? Can the application of pressure lead to a molecular dissociation? We worked to resolve these research objectives by taking advantage of the upgraded capabilities of the ID27 High Pressure Beamline, by carrying out powder and single crystal Xray microdiffraction to elucidate crystalline structures at extreme pressure conditions. Three gasketed diamond anvil cells capable of reaching pressures in excess of 100 GPa were loaded with mixtures consisting of an inert gas (Ne or He) and oxygen, with a maximum concentration of 20% oxygen. The intent was to obtain both polycrystalline (with Ne) as well a single crystal sample (with He) of oxygen at high pressure following the reported procedure  Oxygen mixed with Ne to produce fine polycrystalline samples, although laser heated at high pressure, did not yield XRD data suitable for atomic position refinement as anticipated. For this report, we thus concentrate on results achieved from a single crystal grown under pressure in He. From the X-ray diffraction images, the very good quality of the single crystal led to the confirmation of the crystalline structure of the \uf065-phase having a monoclinic unit cell (space group: C2\/m) with eight oxygen molecules. Furthermore, the clustering of four molecules to form \"O8 supramolecular units\" was validated ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We plan to use laser-heated diamond anvil cell to measure the phase diagram of tin in the 1-2 Mbar range, with a focus on relative stability of hcp vs bcc phase. In fact, static\/dynamic compression under close P-T conditions (~180 GPa) seem to produce different hcp\/bcc phases. We aim at determining if compression rate, or non-hydrostatic stress, have an effect on the phase adopted by this metal under stress. -Objective & expected results-We planned to use laser-heated diamond anvil cell to measure the phase diagram of tin in the 0.6-2 Mbar range, and especially the melting curve at high pressure. We had already a large set of data collected on synchrotron Soleil but very few on the melting curve because of the difficulty to keep molten in the laser hot spot. In the 1.6-Mbar range, we wanted to test the effect of temperature increase on the hcp phase which forms at 1.6 Mbar. -Results and conclusions of the study-Five laser-heated diamond anvils cells (LHDAC), shortly described in Table  The two runs Sn47 and Sn48 were used to study the melting curve of tin between 20 to 70 GPa and the stability of the different crystaline phases. The liquid was identified on XRD patterns thanks to the fast and sensitive detector as presented in Figure  Around 160 GPa at room temperature, Sn-bcc undergoes a phase transition to an hexagonal structure Sn-hcp  The run KI was used to provide complementary data (between 0 and 20 GPa) to obtain the P-V relation for KI at room temperature. The collected data are consistent with the previous one collected at higher pressure. The obtained EOS is slightly different than the one proposed by K\u00f6hler  After alignment of the beamline and calibration by the local contact on the first day, the beam time was used to align and collect date (XRD) for the five cells. The experiment went smoothly; we appreciated the very small spot size of the beamline and the fast and sensitive detector and the accurate sample holder motors. -References-",

    "title":"XRD of water ice above 200 GPa under variable P-T conditions: revealing a structural complexity at planetary interiors pressures.",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal is a continuation of proposal HC-4677 which aimed at measuring the boundary line between bcc insulating and fcc-superionic (fcc-SI) phases of ice. A sample assembly with two boron-doped diamond absorbers has been optimized and it enabled a controlled laser heating of the ice sample up to 200 GPa. A negative slope for the bcc to fcc-SI transition and a metastable quenched fcc-SI phase at ambient temperature have been observed. That hints to the stability of the fcc-SI phase below 1000K by going to 300 GPa. Also, compact phases with greater packing density than bcc should be observed by compressing water ice up to 400 GPa at 300K. We plan to continue the exploration of the detailed structural properties of dense water ice above 200 GPa. These are very challenging measurements of great impact to model planetary interiors of Uranus, Neptune\r\nand other ice giant exoplanets.\r\n Scientific background and objectives H 2 O presents a fascinating phase diagram, exhibiting numerous crystalline structures, amorphous phases and fluid polymorphism depending on thermodynamical conditions. Among ices, superionic (SI) phases that are stable at extremely high pressures and temperatures has attracted great attention due to their unusual fluid-like proton diffusion within a fixed oxygen lattice. Besides its fundamental interest, the high protonic conductivity in SI ice is expected to instigate the unusual non-dipolar and non-axisymmetric magnetic fields of giant ice planets (e.g. Neptune and Uranus), motivating detailed studies of their stability fields and physical properties. Early theoretical and numerical predictions have proposed SI ice phases sharing the same bcc oxygen sublattices as ice VII and X, but also with a close-packed fcc O sublattice  Four diamond anvil cells were studied as synthetized in table  Details Objectives #1 34 \u00b5m (toroidal anvils) The two toroidal anvils were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) machining The gasket hole measured 14 \u00b5m. A small piece of gold was loaded alond with the ice sample for pressure determination using gold EOS. -Measure the ambient temperature EOS of ice up to 300 GPa. #2 50 \u00b5m Central circular pits were FIB-machined to provide space for the two BdD absorbers in the DAC cavity. 1.5-2 \u00b5m-thick Al 2 O 3 layers were deposited on each anvil for thermal insulation. The two absorbers were carefully glued in each pits by using a very thin layer of UV-curing glue. -Probe the bcc-fcc boundary line up to 250 GPa. -Finely measure thermodynamical properties of the fcc-SI phase. -Collect data on the 300 K EOS with frequent sample annealing. # After H 2 O loading, all samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy at our laboratory. Samples were brought at the ID27 beamline of the ESRF to collect in-situ XRD data at ambient and high temperatures using the double-sided YAG-heating set-up available at the beamline. Temperatures values were measured by optical pyrometry. A large number (~250) of ambient temperature XRD diffraction pattern were collected on sample #1 between 1 GPa and 230 GPa, the pressure at which one diamond anvil broke. XRD patterns from both the ice sample and the gold pressure gauge were taken at each pressure changes. These measurements extend the knowledge of the ice EOS ~50 GPa higher than previously published data. Large non-hydrostatic stresses in the sample #1 were observed. Furthermore, at the highest pressures values, only the first X-ray reflexion was sufficiently strong to be followed. Hence, we decided to collect 300 K density measurements on sample #2 during pressure increase: BdD absorbers allowed to perform frequent annealing up to 2000 K to relax non-hydrostatic stresses. Data are currently under analysis to compare the two compression curves. In sample #2, #3 and #4, heating ramps were performed while collecting in-situ XRD patterns at various pressure conditions. Care was taken to balance the temperature at each side of the sample and keep it stable during XRD measurements. Small temperature increments of ~100 K were performed. Frequent XRD cartographies were collected to investigate sample inhomogeneities. Sample #2 reached 220 GPa and ~2700 K when the anvils broke inducing a pressure drop to ~ 60 GPa. Samples #3 and #4 were keeped at their last investigated pressures (200 GPa and 80 GPa) for further analysis. These measurements allowed to confirm our previous measurements up to 200 GPa, and are currently under deeper analysis. XRD measurements during heating ramps have allowed to investigate the thermal expansion of the fcc-SI phase. During several quasi-isobaric ramps at different pressure conditions, we have been able to observe a strong variation of fcc-SI phase volume, manifesting a thermal expansion bump (Schottky bump). Such feature was reported as a direct signature of the superionic transition ",

    "title":"Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Carbon Nitrides",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The search for materials harder than diamonds is one of the holy grails of material sciences. Many candidate compounds have been suggested and carbon nitrides are among the most compelling.1,2 As it stands, none of the high-pressure experiments on the C-N system resulted in the full structural determination of a new carbon nitride. Here, we propose to employ the extremely powerful method of single-crystal X-ray diffraction of a polycrystalline sample (SC-XRDp) to characterize the reaction products of a laser-heated carbon-nitrogen precursor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE, C6N4), between 20 and 130 GPa. The compressibility and stability range of the produced carbon nitrides will be determined. Preliminary experiments show the synthesis of a new compound. For these experiments, we proposed to employ the extremely powerful method of single-crystal Xray diffraction of a polycrystalline sample (SC-XRDp) to characterize the reaction products of a laser-heated carbonnitrogen precursor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE, C6N4), between 20 and 130 GPa. These experiments were expected to result in i) the synthesis of novel CxNy solids, ii) the determination of their crystal structure and iii) obtaining their equation of state and establishing if they are recoverable to atmospheric pressure. These experiments were previously impossible to do without the ESRF incredibly intense beam combined with the SC-XRDp technique and were hoped to finally provide answers regarding the feasibility of synthesizing ultrahard CxNy compounds. BX90-type diamond anvil cells with culets of 120 to 80 \u03bcm were prepared. TCNE was loaded along with molecular nitrogen, acting as a reagent as well as a pressure transmitting medium. Pressures were measured based on the equation of state of the Re gasket and verified using the Raman signal of diamond and nitrogen.  The experiments were a huge success. A new phase was synthesized as well as solved and refined using the obtained single-crystal data. An unwarp of the data collected at the pressure of synthesis of shown in Figure  With the synthesis of this phase, and its recoverability to ambient conditions our objectives were accomplished. However, further investigation of the C-N phase diagram, for example employing different precursors, is of great relevance to try and produce other novel C-N phases with different stoichiometry than the one here obtained.

    "title":"Studying the laser amorphization of tellurium",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Tellurium shows many interesting properties, but our knowledge about the amorphous solid state of Te is limited, mostly due to its spontaneous crystallization at room temperature. It has recently been demonstrated that amorphization can be induced in Te by ultrafast optical lasers, but no structural information of this amorphized phase has been reported. Thus, we propose to study laser-amorphized Te using optical pump, X-ray probe at ID09. We aim at measuring the WAXS pattern of the laser-amorphized Te and studying its temperature dependence. Our results will reveal details on the structure of amorphous Te, possibly over a wide temperature range, which will provide crucial information to understand the thermodynamic and structural behaviors of Te. Figure  A typical scan is performed in the following way: First, we collect several X-ray diffraction patterns of the cold (crystalline) sample. Then, we deliver 10 laser shots onto the sample. This is because the degree of amorphization was observed to increase significantly with the number of laser shots, up to about 10 shots. The same phenomenon was also observed by Cheng et al.  Figure  We also analyze quantitatively the evolution as a function of time, as shown in panels C and D. The former shows the change in the intensity of the crystalline peak (slightly below 2 \u00c5 -1 ) and the latter the change in the intensity of the amorphous feature, both with respect to the cold diffraction data. These time-dependence data can be well described by an exponential decay function fit, as indicated by the red dashed lines. The extracted decay time constant, \ud835\udf0f 0 , is about 90 s. We note that similar re-crystallization results have been observed by Cheng et al. ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Iron(II)oxalate dihydrate has emerged as an important building block for the preparation of new, functional advanced materials. Despite the extensive investigation carried out over the years, almost nothing is known about its physico-chemical properties at extreme conditions. Preliminary results have shown that FeC2O4 \u00d7 2 H2O exhibits several structural transitions upon pressure increase. The simple chemical composition, the high oxygen fugacity of the system and the capability of Fe to exist in multiple valence states, are desirable conditions to attempt on the synthesis of new exotic C, O and H bearing materials at extreme conditions. The aim of this study is the investigation of structural evolution (electronic and atomic) of FeC2O4 \u00d7 2 H2O at extreme pressures and its stability at extreme pressures and temperatures. Synthesis of new materials with similar elemental stoichiometry will help elucidating light elements sequestration during Earth\u2019s differentiation processes.

From Figure  The XRD spectra are shown in the figure  In the XRD integrated patterns we identified with asterisks the appearance of new peaks, with circles the disappearance of previous peaks and with arrows the evident variations in peaks intensity. Qualitatively, we could locate a first change in the structure at 7,9 GPa, where new peaks emerge and others disappear. We noticed, in accordance with preliminary studies of M\u00fcller et al. ",

    "title":"Magnetism of mass-selected FeRh B2 nanocrystals in epitaxy on perovskite oxide",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Near equiatomic composition, FeRh bulk alloys exhibit a CsCl-type (B2) chemically ordered phase related to a metamagnetic transition from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) to a ferromagnetic (FM) state close to ambient. Recently, we underlined the main role of Rh atoms on the metamagnetic transition for samples with high-density FeRh nanoparticles assemblies, where Rh kept a residual FM signature even at low temperature. The objective of this proposal is to study low-density samples, of mass-selected FeRh nanoparticles (NPs) grown on perovskite oxide, from X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism (XAS\/XMCD) experiments at Fe K and Rh L-edges at ID12 to explore interfacial strain effects on the magnetic order of epitaxial FeRh nanoparticles. Both use of quarter-wave plate to enhance the circular polarization rate and SDD with appropriate energy filter mounted in the 8T-cryomagnet would improve the signal to noise ratio in such diluted hybrid-nanostructures. FeRh clusters were produced in gas phase with two different diameters 3 and 7 nm by Mass-Selected Low Energy Cluster Beam Deposition (MS-LECBD) in UHV chamber on Si, SrTiO3 (STO) and Nb doped STO (Nb-STO) substrates at Lyon with a carbon capping before their transfer in air. We have verified that as-prepared NPs are in the chemically disordered fcc A1 phase, while UHV post-annealing above 600\u00b0C leads systematically to chemical ordering for FeRh nanocrystal towards the B2 phase  By using two Silicon Drift detectors (SDD) mounted in the vacuum 8T-cryomagnet chamber, we first measured 140nm-thick FeRh on Si substrate annealed 3h 700\u00b0C (TM2228-B2) sample as a reference to optimize the Xray beam alignement on a 10\u00b0 sample holder at room temperature under 2T applied magnetic field and in order to estimate the circular polarization enhancement obtained by using or not the qwp. In both cases, a clear XANES signature characteristic of the chemically ordered B2 FeRh phase has been evidenced on this sample from oscillation just after the white Rh L3,2 edges  Here, we report comparative XAS\/XMCD results at 2T and one hysteresis loop at L3-Rh edge up to 7T: \uf0b7 Thin FeRh NPs with 7 nm in diameter on Si with C-capping (equivalent FeRh thickness of 3 nm) TM2219 sample (as-prepared and annealed 3h at 530\u00b0C + 1h at 580\u00b0C) to compare to reference TM2228 B2. \uf0b7 Thin FeRh NPs with 7 nm in diam. on Nb-STO with C-capping (equivalent FeRh thickness of 1 nm) TM2335 (as-prepared sample and annealed 3h at 530\u00b0C) to compare to above sample TM2219 on Si substrate. \uf0b7 Thin FeRh NPs with 3 nm in diameter on Nb-STO with C-capping (eq. FeRh thickness of 0.5 nm) TM2334 (as-prepared sample and annealed 3h at 530\u00b0C + 1h at 580\u00b0C) to compare with 2 already annealed samples on STO TM2109 (at 600\u00b0C) and TM2127 (at 800\u00b0C). First of all, for in place annealing temperature T\u2264 530\u00b0C, we noted nor clear structural, nor magnetic evolution from XANES\/XMCD spectra at L-Rh edge (as seen in Fig.  As a conclusion, this present XAS\/XMCD study at Rh L2, 3 edges on very diluted FeRh NPs samples clearly underlines the fact that SDD with appropriate energy filter adapted in the 8T-cryomagnet improve the signal to noise ratio and that the use of qwp enhance the circular polarization rate enough to be able to detect structural and induced magnetic moment at the local Rh environment for FeRh NPs assemblies with less than a few nm of equivalent FeRh thickness ",

    "title":"Determination of nitrogen's phase diagram up to 400 GPa",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"As an archetypal diatomic molecule, the high-pressure allotropes of molecular nitrogen are an excellent testbed for refining solid-state physics models. Above 110 GPa, the physicochemical properties of nitrogen radically change as it transforms into a 3D polymeric single-bonded solid. While ab-initio calculations predict a straightforward phase diagram for the polymeric phases\u2014with only three polymeric solids up to 2100 GPa\u2014recent experimental investigations suggest a much greater complexity. As it stands, four polymeric nitrogen phases have been synthesized below 245 GPa, with only one matching theoretical predictions. We here aim to uncover nitrogen's phase diagram between 220 and 400 GPa, discover new polymeric phases, solve their structure with single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and determine their stability range. These experiments will challenge current theoretical models, providing a rare example of the behavior of simple homoatomic systems at ultrahigh pressures. To accomplish the objectives of this proposal, two toroidal diamond anvil cells (DAC), each with a culet size of 25x350 \uf06dm (DAC1), 25x350 \uf06dm (DAC2), as well as a DAC equipped with regular bevelled diamond anvils of 30x350 \uf06dm (DAC3), were carefully prepared. All were loaded with molecular nitrogen at high pressure (~1300 bars) in a gas loader, and a small aggregate of Au, used as a pressure calibrant and, if necessary, as a laser absorber. DAC1, DAC2 and DAC3 were precompressed to pressures of 210, 70 and 130 GPa. Unfortunately, the anvils of DAC1 broke moments before our departure to the ESRF. Moreover, the geometry of DAC2 was non-optimal, with a sample cavity of about 6 \u03bcm at 15 GPa. DAC3, however, appeared as a very promising sample with an experimental cavity of about 12 \u03bcm at 130 GPa (see Figure  It must be noted that this beamtime was also the impetus for an ID27-led development: an on-axis and offline YAG laser-heating system. The system, designed by CEA and ESRF staff, was assembled before the beamtime. The system presents advantages over an off-axis online setup, i.e. a very straightforward and fast sample alignment procedure, an adjustable, smaller beam size (down to 1 micron) thanks to the use of Mitutoyo objectives coupled with a variable beam expander, and the fact that it frees the beamline for X-ray measurements on other samples while another is being heated. Given its very new nature, the system does not yet allow for temperature measurements. Upon arriving at the ID27 beamline, the CeO2 and vanadinite calibrants were ran. After screening DAC2 and DAC3, a change of strategy was decided in order to maximize the beamtime's scientific output. Indeed, it was decided to laser-heat DAC3 at the pressure of 150 GPa to try to form either cg-N or bp-N, both synthesizable at this pressure.  According to the above-described strategy, DAC3 was laser-heated at 150 GPa using the new offline setup, and a large single-crystal of cg-N formed. The DAC sample was successfully pressurized to 250 GPa in seven pressure steps and, as shown in Figure ",

    "title":"Study of the degradation of Cadmium Yellow in historical and historically reconstructed oil paints",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal concerns the study of the composition and degradation of Cadmium Yellow (CdY) oil paints in relation to the historical synthesis methods of the pigment. Although the degradation mechanism of CdY paints has been elucidated, it has been demonstrated that not all CdY paints show the same extent of degradation. This fact can be related to the use of different historical synthesis methods, which influence the pigment properties and could induce a different reactivity of the pigment. We propose to characterize through \u00b5-XRF\/\u00b5-XANES analysis the chemical speciation and stratigraphic distribution of compounds in artificially aged CdY model paints prepared with pigments synthesized by different historical methods, to provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of degradation in relation with the manufacturing process. The research will complement the study of historical paint samples from original CdY degraded paintings, to compare artificial degradation with real one.  The first experimental session aimed at studying the composition and degradation of Cadmium Yellow (CdY) oil paints in relation to the historical synthesis methods of the pigment  The second experimental session was dedicated to the study of the degradation occurred on the passe-partout of the Folio 843 of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus. The passe-partout shows a darkening phenomenon along the edge of Leonardo's drawing. Preliminary analyses have demonstrated that the degradation is not of micro-biological origin, but is most probably associated to the presence of Hg. The study performed at ID21 aims at defining the chemical speciation of Hg to hypothesize the chemical processes that have induced such type of degradation. This will allow to adopt the appropriate measures of active and preventive conservation for this and other Folios showing the same type of degradation. The model paints were prepared mixing cadmium yellow pigments (synthesized from two different historical recipes and commercially available) with linseed oil, and artificially aged for 45 days under light and at high relative humidity conditions (RH ~80%). Thin sections were prepared to map the distribution of the chemical species through the cross-section. The passe-partout of the Folio 843 of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus was cut in three paper samples, belonging to the dark, medium dark and white regions. No further preparation was adopted. In each experimental section \u00b5XRF maps, fluo-XAS (at S K-edge) maps and single point \u00b5XANES at different elements edge were acquired. Data were analysed with PyMCA, ATHENA and TXM-Wizard. Quantitative estimation of the compounds through \u00b5XANES measurements and correlation with \u00b5XRD analysis (obtained at ID13) are currently undertaken. Analysis conducted at ID21 on CdY paints shows a clear difference in the degradation of the paintings prepared from different pigments. Indeed, samples prepared from pigments synthesized from Na2S have a more prominent degradation, with the formation of a thick cadmium sulfate layer on top of sulfide layer. In contrast, reference samples and samples synthesized from H2S show a very low quantities of cadmium sulfates. Beside the presence of sulfate (due to photo-oxidation of CdS), sulfites were also detected in the degraded samples, as possibly intermediate states of degradation. Analysis on the passe-partout of Folio 843 of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus shows the co-localization of Hg and S in the dark and medium-dark regions, suggesting the presence of black mercury sulfide. Sulfide is also detected through \u00b5XANES at S K-edge. No mercury was instead detected in the white paper, allowing to hypothesize that mercury was originally present as antibacterial agent in the glue mixture used for the adhesion of the edge around the Leonardo's drawing, which degraded developing black HgS. The collected data on CdS have been complemented with \u00b5XRD data collected at ID13 and will be published in a paper in preparation. An abstract will be submitted for presentation for ChemCH conference. Data on Folio 843 of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus will be complemented with HR-XRD at ID22 and published later.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"During the 2005 excavation campaign at the Capitolium of Cumae, the first Greek colony on the mainland of Italy, pottery was unearthed.\r\nPottery is considered one of the elements that set off the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution and changed the human beings\u2019 lifestyle from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement. The study of the pottery production method is useful to understand the technological level reached by an ancient civilization. One of the most informative aspects is the firing history which includes the heating rate, the maximum temperature reached, the firing duration and the atmosphere in which the ceramic is fired that can be oxidising or reducing. \r\nThanks to different experimental techniques like XRPD, XRF, SEM and FTIR, is possible to estimate the firing history, characterize the raw materials used for the pottery production and, finally, understand if these relics have been fired in the open air or closed kiln.\r\n\r\n The software Qualx2 1 was used to perform a qualitative phase analysis on all of the collected diffraction patterns. These preliminary studies demonstrate that the mineral composition of the various samples is quite similar, with the exception of samples 6 and 10, which show no signs of pyroxenes. Furthermore, with the exception of sample 7, all of the samples contain hematite, indicating an oxidising environment during the firing. Given the mineral composition, a firing temperature greater than 900 \u00b0C might be estimated for all the samples. Sample 5, a kitchen pottery shard, caught our attention since its peculiar mineral composition suggests a firing temperature higher than 1100 \u00b0C. a For space reasons we decided to show only a few representative samples.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims at deepening understanding the complex discoloration issue of emerald green and Scheele\u2019s green paints (hereafter called \u201cEM\u201d and \u201cSH\u201d, respectively) affecting late 19th c.-early 20th c. oil paintings. \u00b5-XRF mapping and \u00b5-XANES spectroscopy at S K-, Cu K- and As K-edges will be exploited to perform a spatially resolved study of EM and SH oil paint systems before and after exposure to controlled conditions of light, humidity and temperature. Such analyses will permit to define how the pigment formulation, the binding medium and environmental agents trigger EM and SH degradation processes. A spatially resolved study by \u03bc-XRF and \u03bc-XANES spectroscopy analyses at S K-, Cu K and As K-edges to understand the degradation process of Cu-\/Asbased oil paint systems. Experiment number: HG-199 Beamline: ID21 Date of experiment: from: 25\/11\/2022 to: 28\/11\/2022 Date of report: 01\/03\/2023 Shifts: Local contact(s): Marine Cotte Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): During the two experiments, we investigated the alteration products of the copper and arsenic-based pigments Emerald Green (Cu(CH3COO)2\u20223Cu(AsO2)2) and Scheele's Green (hereafter called \"EM\" and \"SH\", respectively)  To understand how the additives\/synthesis residues and environmental parameters (light and\/or humidity) affect the chemistry of EM and SH oil paints, we have performed \u03bc-XRF mapping and \u03bc-XANES analysis at Cu K-edge (ID21) and at As Kedge (BM23) on a series of artificially aged model samples made with EM and SH synthesized powders and with historical EM powders. The list of samples that we have analyzed at beamlines ID21 and BM23 is reported below: a) EM and SH-based model samples (24 in total): synthesized or historical powders mixed with linseed oil (4:1 weight ratio) before and after exposure to different aging conditions (combination of light and relative humidity); table  b) set of Cu-, and As-reference powders and of pigment powders used to prepare mock-up samples (ca. 20 in total). All model paint mock-ups were investigated as embedded resin thin-sections (thickness of ca. 5 \u00b5m) both at beamline ID21 and BM23 Each reference powder was analyzed as a thin film (thickness< 50 \u03bcm) fixed on sulfur-free tape. \uf0b7 ID21-experimental set-up. \u00b5-XRF and \u03bc-XANES measurements at Cu K-edge (8.978 *keV) were performed at the scanning X-ray microscope (SXM) end-station using a fixed exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator. The incident beam was focused with Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors down to a diameter of ca. 0.5\u00d70.5 \u00b5m\u00b2 (h\u00d7v). The energy calibration was performed at the Cu K-edge by setting the position of the peak maximum of the first order derivative spectrum of copper foil at 9.00545 keV. XRF signals were acquired in the horizontal plane and at 69\u00b0 with respect to the incident beam direction using a single energy-dispersive silicon drift detector (Xflash 5100, Bruker).   Single point \u03bc-XANES spectra were acquired in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy around the Cu K-edge (8.95-9.2 keV; energy step: from 0.5 to 1 eV). Full spectral XRF mode XANES mapping experiments were performed by tuning the energy of the incident beam around the Cu K-edge. Maps of the same region of interest were collected by employing 20-30 ms\/pixel at ca. 120 different energies with a variable energy step (from 1 to 4 eV). \uf0b7 BM23-experimental set-up. \u00b5-XRF and \u03bc-XANES investigations at As K-edge (11.8667 keV) were performed using a fixed exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator and an incident beam with a diameter of ca. 3\u00d73 \u00b5m\u00b2 (h\u00d7v). XRF signals were collected by means of both a 13-element Ge detector and Si drift-diode array detector. \u03bc-XANES spectra were recorded in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy across the As K-edge (11.83-12 keV; energy step: 0.5 eV). The XANES spectra were recorded by following a line across the thin-section, with 5 \u00b5m step in the bottommost side of the paint (bulk area) and with 2.5 \u00b5m step in its uppermost part (i.e. closer to the surface). \u03bc-XRF maps of the same region of interest were collected using 200 ms\/pixel at the three following energies: (i) 11.8759 keV and (ii) 11.87961 keV to favor the excitation of As 3+ and As 5+ -species, respectively and (iii) 12.0 keV to obtain the XRF intensity of all As-species. ATHENA  As an example, Figure  Concerning SH mock-ups, they show a very similar reactivity with respect to EM samples, by revealing the formation of a superficial As 5+ -rich alteration layer (in general thicker than the one of EM mock-ups) after treatment both in the presence and absence of light. In addtion, in some of SH samples, the oxidation of As 3+ to As 5+ occurred along with the reduction of Cu 2+ to Cu + (data not reported).",

    "abstract_inverted_index":" Background. Brown algae of the Laminariales (kelps) are the strongest accumulators of iodine among living organisms. They represent a major pump in the global biogeochemical cycle of iodine and in particular, the major source of iodocarbons in the coastal atmosphere. Nevertheless, the chemical state and biological significance of accumulated iodine have remained unknown. Elucidation of these questions was the objective of this study. Using an interdisciplinary array of techniques, chiefly relying on synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we showed that the accumulated form is iodide  Conversely, Sr is strongly associated with alginate in brown algal cell walls (Fig.  Outlook and wider context. Currently, we are complementing this work by transmission electron microscopy using chemically fixed vs. cryofixed L. digitata tissues in order to unambiguously establish the nature of the vesicles containing the intracellular iodine store (in particular, whether these are indeed vacuoles). We are planning to publish this in an interdisciplinary paper together with results of radiolabeling experiments showing that iodide is mobilized upon oxidative stress by a hitherto-uncharacterized anion transporter different from the well-known eukaryotic chloride channels. Opposite subcellular distribution patterns for three elements -Strontium is mostly in cell walls, like by passive adsorption from seawater -Bromine is in vacuoles mostly in the inner cell layers of the thallus -Iodine is in vacuoles mostly of the outer cell layers of the thallus Contrary to earlier reports based on chemically fixed samples, in shock-frozen hydrated samples bromine and iodine are localized not in the cell wall but in the vacuole.

    "title":"Reconstruction of a neural circuit that controls walking by combining X-ray nanotomography and electron microscopy",
    "abstract_inverted_index":" Our understanding of the nervous system is built on our knowledge of the structure and connectivity of neurons. However, unraveling their structure is a daunting technical challenge because neuronal axons and dendrites are small in diameter (~20-1000 nm) and traverse long distances (millimeters or more). With current technology, we generally can either image a sparse subset of neurons with a large field of view (FOV) through fluorescent labeling and visible light microscopy (LM) or comprehensively map small regions via electron microscopy (EM). Advancing our understanding of neuronal networks will require imaging modalities that can simultaneously achieve high resolution and large FOV. At present, LM and magnetic resonance imaging techniques can image large regions, but not with sufficient resolution to densely resolve neuronal processes. Recent advances in super-resolution imaging have greatly improved resolving power for LM  Hard X-rays are an attractive illumination probe for imaging thick tissue samples with fine spatial resolution due to their high penetration power and sub-nanometer wavelength. Previously, attenuation-based X-ray microtomography with a synchrotron source enabled visualization of metal stained, sparse wiring in the Drosophila brain  Here we present a pipeline based on X-ray holographic nano-tomography (also called X-ray nanoholotomography, or XNH) that enables imaging of large volumes of neural tissue with sufficient resolution to extract the morphologies of densely packed neurons without specific labeling. We combined a highly focused and brilliant hard X-ray nano-probe  To explore the potential of XNH for imaging neuronal morphologies, we imaged samples of mouse cortex as well as the brain, ventral nerve cord (VNC), and leg of adult Drosophila. We varied the reconstructed isotropic voxel size (edge length) from 30 nm to 120 nm, yielding FOVs (edge length of square cylindrical volume) from 60 \u00b5m to 240 \u00b5m (96 \u00b5m to 384 \u00b5m with extended FOV, see Supplementary Table  XNH imaging was conducted at the nano-imaging beamline ID16A at the European Synchrotron (ESRF). For image acquisition, the samples were positioned downstream of the focal spot of a highly brilliant X-ray beam (Fig.  Figure  To quantify the spatial resolution of XNH image volumes, we utilized Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC)  Although FSC is a commonly utilized method to quantify resolution in many imaging modalities including X-ray imaging, its implementation is somewhat controversial  To verify that XNH images faithfully reproduce the ultrastructure of biological samples, we collected thinsections of samples after XNH imaging and imaged the same regions at higher lateral resolution with EM. We found that corresponding EM and XNH image data from the Drosophila leg nerve (50 nm pixels, Fig.  Based on the similarity between XNH and EM images, we reasoned that cell type-specific labeling strategies previously developed for EM could be adapted for XNH. EM-visible labeling of specific cell types has been achieved using peroxidases that deposit dense precipitates inside the organelles of genetically-defined cell populations  To image large regions with complex topology at high resolution, we stitched multiple, overlapping XNH scans to image the majority of a Drosophila leg (coxa, trochanter, femur, and tibia segments) and the associated first thoracic (T1) neuromere in the VNC (Fig.  Until now, tracing of individual neuron morphologies from X-ray image data has been only possible through sparse labeling  While manual tracing can produce targeted, highquality reconstructions, it can be time-consuming. To accelerate neuronal reconstructions, we adapted an automated segmentation pipeline developed for EM  To assess whether automated segmentation can be used with XNH data to reconstruct neuronal morphologies, we applied automated segmentation to an XNH image volume encompassing the majority of a T1 neuromere and part of the main front leg nerve (Fig.  Here, we present non-destructive, X-ray phase-contrast imaging of neural tissue with sufficiently high resolution and FOV to densely reconstruct individual neuronal morphologies. We have obtained these results by combining several innovative elements. The instrument developed at the ID16A beamline at the European Synchrotron  Sample properties are also important for image quality. Here, we chose to use heavy-metal staining protocols for EM, which enhance contrast in cell membranes, facilitate dense reconstruction of neurons, and allow the same samples to be imaged post-hoc with EM (Fig.  We demonstrate that XNH enables individual neuronal morphologies to be reconstructed in their dense circuit context. Here, we adapted reconstruction approaches developed originally for large-scale EM. Because XNH images appear qualitatively similar to EM images (Fig.  The larger voxel size of XNH data relative to EM data offers several practical advantages. Larger voxels produce substantially smaller image files for a given tissue volume, which can be analyzed without specialized hardware infrastructure necessary for large-scale EM datasets. Furthermore, manual and automated analysis can be completed more rapidly, considering the reduced complexity of the task. Indeed, we deployed CNNs for automated segmentation in XNH volumes on timescales of a few hours (~ 0.1 s\/\u03bcm 3 XNH compared with ~ 10 s\/\u03bcm 3 for ssTEM). XNH is complementary to and compatible with both LM and EM imaging. XNH offers superior resolution with denser labeling compared to most LM techniques, and can image samples too thick for LM without tissue clearing. XNH achieves lower resolution than volumetric EM, however, offers advantages in speed, convenience, and data handling. Since physical thin-sectioning is not necessary, XNH can image specimens that are difficult to cut reliably (such as a whole Drosophila leg). XNH image data also requires no section-to-section alignment, eliminating a step that continues to be a computational challenge for large-scale EM datasets. By filling a gap between the resolutions of LM and EM, XNH can enable multiscale characterization of neural circuits that depend on both long-range connections and local computations, such as the Drosophila motor system and mammalian cortex. For example, a population of cortical neurons could be functionally imaged with LM, their long-range inputs mapped via XNH, and their local connectivity reconstructed using targeted EM. At the resolutions achieved here, XNH is well-suited for mapping projectomes (i.e. atlases of all large-caliber connections between brain regions). Previously, singleneuron-resolution projectomes have been obtained using large-scale EM or built up from sparse fluorescent labeling  It is worth noting that the results demonstrated here are still far from any theoretical resolution limits for hard Xrays, which have wavelengths on the angstrom scale. In practice, XNH resolution is limited by focusing optics, mechanical stability and precision of stage movements, sample warping and performance of reconstruction algorithms, rather than by fundamental physical limits. The upgrade of the European Synchrotron (to be completed in 2020), along with planned improvements to X-ray optics and detectors, will likely improve imaging resolution and throughput. Future technical advances may allow XNH to resolve the thinnest neuron branches and the synapses between them, opening a wide array of applications in mapping neuronal circuit connectivity.",

    "title":"Cu-coordination changes triggered by external ligands",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"In order to control their high redox activity, in living systems Cu ions are normally coordinated to proteins and short peptides. One of the main functions of Cu in biology is as a catalytic redox centre in enzymes where the role of Cu is often to activate dioxygen. The coordination chemistry of Cu(II) and Cu(I) bound to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are very different (e.g. in the case of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease). Similar differences in the coordination chemistry is also reported in the Cu-\u03b1-synuclein that is related to Parkinson disease. Such flexible Cu-IDP are quite competent in di-oxygen activation to form reactive oxygen species, which could contribute to the oxidative stress observed in the diseases.Hence a central question is how this redox process can occur. In fact, going from Cu(II) to Cu(I) and back needs a quite important rearrangement of the peptide around the Cu-ion. Answering this question is the main goal of the present proposal. Cu deregulation has been reported in several neurodegenerative diseases. Misplaced Cu is supposed to bind to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides in Alzheimer's (AD) or \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's (PD) diseases. Both peptides\/proteins belong to the class of the so-called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and are prone to form amyloids, i.e. beta-sheet rich aggregates. Moreover, these Cupeptide\/protein complexes have been shown to catalyze efficiently in vitro the ROS production in the presence of dioxygen and reducing agents. Hence Cu-bound amyloid peptides became the target of a therapeutic approach aimed at inhibiting the over-production of Cu-induced ROS might lead to the oxidative stress observed in AD and PD. The coordination chemistry of Cu(II) and Cu(I) bound to A\u03b2 peptides is very different. In A\u03b2, both Cu(II) and Cu(I) bind to the N-terminal domain (A\u03b21-16). Cu(II) is coordinated in a distorted squarepyramidal geometry with 3 nitrogen atoms (two belonging to histidine residues) and 1 oxygen atom, plus an axial O ligand, while Cu(I) has a digonal coordination involving two histidine residues. In order to explain the relatively efficient ROS production by Cu-A\u03b2, it has been suggested that the latter is catalyzed by a low populated Cu-state, called an \"in-between state that can cycle between Cu(I) and Cu(II) redox states with little atomic rearrangement and hence produce efficiently ROS. In this proposal, we aimed at trapping and characterizing possible intermediates in Cu-A\u03b2 redox cycling via X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at the Cu K-edge. XAS measurements at the Cu K-edge were performed at the BM30 beamline of the ESRF. In order to identify possible intermediate species appearing during the Cu(II)-A\u03b21-16 photoreduction process, the spectra of Cu(I)-A\u03b21-16 and Cu(II)-A\u03b21-16 resting states were first acquired and best-fit structures were obtained (Figure ",

In particular, we firstly want to test the hypothesis that AD is accompanied by changes in neuron structure, density and packing in the DG, and secondly whether amyloid plaques are linked by filamentous connections. For this purpose, we will use the unique capabilities of ID16a as a world leading instrument for full field 3d high resolution phase contrast, in combination with advanced iterative phase retrieval and segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, the allocated beamtime allowed us to compare differently stains (OsO4, rOTO) used to enhance contrast for the myoloarchitecture of murine corpus callosum (CC), at voxel sizes down to 50 nm , see Fig.  In summary, the specificiations of ID16a (including the progress associated with the upgrade) allowed us to demonstrate increased resolution and image quality based on optimized data acquisition and phase retrieval\/ reconstruction algorithms. Different staining protocols were successfully implemented, resulting in a promising multimodal, correlative and multiscale approach ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) drives many critical cellular processes. We will use laser-induced release from a caged, inactive form of ATP followed by short X-ray pulses at the dedicated time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) beamline ID09 at ESRF-EBS to study protein conformational change in real time. We aim to identify fast-forming ATP-binding states in both bacterial and eukaryotic ATP-driven Ca2+ transport, and to monitor how the lipidic environment affect functional structural rearrangements. We will use the same pump-and-probe methodology to track catalysis of nucleotide interconversion, which is central to cellular hemostasis. Here, we aim to determine kinetics and structural dynamics of fast-forming intermediates associated with ATP binding. The results will provide better understanding of lipid-induced membrane transport regulation, cooperative protein dynamics, and significantly increase the number of protein targets for similar time-resolved X-ray studies.  P-type ATPase proteins are found in biological membranes and execute active transport by means of ATP hydrolysis to transport (mostly ions) against a concentration gradient. These membrane protein transporters are critical to several important biological processes, such as the muscle contraction-relaxation cycle, cellular homeostasis of transition metals, and upholding membrane potential. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) governs muscle relaxation and is by far the best-characterized member of the P-type ATPase family with several crystallized intermediates  Having established a TR-XSS experimental design and MD simulation-based structural refinement protocol for P-type ATPase activation, we now seek to explore other targets in the family. SERCA is a special case due to its very high presence in membranes from rabbit skeletal muscle. Therefore, to study other P-type ATPases would require performing TR-XSS experiments on recombinant proteins. In the LS-2999 experiment, we collected two high-quality datasets a bacterial Ca2+ ATPase (LMCA1) (Fig. ",

    "title":"High resolution powder diffraction of proteins associated with pharmaceutical interest.",
    "abstract_inverted_index":" The current proposal focuses on the structural determination via XRPD of nano\/micro-crystalline proteins and complexes associated with diseases and epidemics, which are or will become a threat to public health. XRPD allows for studies of low quality crystals, polymorph screening and time-resolved studies. The proteins that we will study are: (a) Microcrystalline protein drugs against diabetes: Insulin-ligand complexes & insulin analogues for improving drug delivery & formulation. (b) Target proteins of newly emerging viruses for drug design. Concerning drug delivery, microcrystalline samples will be produced and characterized upon variation of their physicochemical environment. We focus on pH, humidity and oxidative stress mimicking in vivo conditions. In the present experiment we collected X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) data from macromolecular samples on ID22, the high-resolution powder diffraction beamline at ESRF. Approximately 200 samples of human insulin cocrystallized with various small organic ligands at different pH levels were measured during this experiment. Human insulin is a highly polymorphic protein, with 3 distinct molecular conformations and crystallizing in over 30 crystal forms (i.e. crystal polymorphs) by variation of its physicochemical environment. Our team has been systematically exploring the phase map of human insulin upon ligand binding and pH variation, for the development of novel, more effective, crystalline, anti-diabetic formulations (Figure  Using an already established crystallization protocol, we prepared insulin samples with 11 different ligands, namely derivatives of phenol (phenol, 4-nitrophenol, p-coumaric acid, resveratrol), resorcinol (resorcinol, \u03b1-resorcylic acid, \u03b2resorcylic acid) and benzoic acid (benzoic acid, 4hydroxybenzoic acid, gentisic acid, gallic acid). Data were collected from borosilicate glass capillaries loaded with the polycrystalline slurries, employing the new 13-channel crystal analyzer stage and the EIGER 2M detector. The data were then indexed, and Pawley refinements were performed, enabling the extraction of accurate unit-cell parameters for each phase present per samples. Multiphase refinements were performed for datasets with co-existing crystal polymorphs. Contrary to single-crystal techniques, the ability to characterize the entire crystalline sample with powder diffraction has proven to be crucial in our case. While the high polymorphicity of human insulin constitutes it an ideal target for polymorph screening experiments, at the same time, slight variations on the crystallization protocols can lead to vastly different polymorphs. For the past two years we have been trying to grow single crystals for several polymorphs of interest, especially for phenol and resorcinol complexes. By adapting the batch protocols for single crystal growth, we have introduced additional variation to the crystallization condition, resulting in our inability to grow crystals of certain polymorphs. By collecting data at ID22 from samples grown with multiple crystallization protocols, we were finally able to identify the factors affecting polymorph selection on our samples. Using the insights from the high-resolution XRPD data, we managed to grow single crystals for the polymorphs of interest and collect diffraction data at other synchrotron facilities. Structure solution and refinement is still ongoing. During our experiment, we also collected a few datasets which were then reprocessed to reduce the axial divergence, that is especially pronounced at the low 2\u03b8 range, by employing the 2D segments recorded by the EIGER detector  Overall, the data collected at ID22 have enriched the ever-expanding phase map of human insulin, guided subsequent singlecrystal experiments and enabled structure refinement attempts of polymorphs that were previously considered too hard to tackle via powder diffraction.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Recent studies have shown that pineal gland (PG) dysfunction, due to PG volume reduction and PG calcification, is involved in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this framework, we propose the investigation of the PG soft tissue and calcification from post-mortem human brains in norm and AD pathology on the cell level, using X-ray holographic nano-tomography for a comparative study. This research will allow us to evaluate the degree of involvement of the human pineal gland in the development of AD.

Numerous studies indicate that PG functional activity is significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, indicating an important role for PG in development of AD. However, the degree of involvement and damage of the human PG in the development of AD is not fully understood yet. The aim of the present study is the thorough investigation of the morphological features of PG soft tissue and mineral concretions in human PG without pathology (control group) and in PG affected AD. We intend to analyze in 3D the topological arrangement of calcified zones in PG, inspect primary calcification centers and investigate the PG soft tissue degeneration in control and AD groups. Samples: The samples were 0.4x0.4x4 mm3 fragments of the post-mortem human PG in norm and AD states. In total 7 samples were measured: 2 samples in norm state and 5 samples with AD. 2 samples (1 norm + 1AD) were prepared according to standard protocol for electron microscopy with osmium tetroxide staining followed by Epon 812 resin embedding; 5 samples (1 norm + 4 AD) were prepared without staining followed by paraffin embedding. Set up: Tomographic images were acquired at ID16a beamline using standard holographic nano-tomography set up with imaging detector lens-coupled to a Ximea camera using the CMOS image sensor technology with 6k x 6k pixels binned to 2k x 2k. The energy of incident X-ray beam was 33.35 KeV and an effective pixel size was of about 100 and 150 nm. Moreover, we acquire in local tomography selected regions of each sample with effective pixel size 25 nm and 50 nm. The detector exposure time for each projection was 100, 150 and 200 ms. For each sample a total of four tomographic scans images were acquired by placing the sample at predetermined distances from the detector. During a step-wise tomographic scan we acquired 2000 projections with rotation of the sample over 180 degrees. Data processing: For phase maps reconstruction, each of four radiographs were dark-and flat field corrected, resized to have the same dimensions, aligned, and then a phase retrieval algorithm was applied. The alignment of the projections and the phase retrieval are done using in-house GNU Octave scripts whereas the tomography reconstruction is done using the FBP method available in PyHST2. The correct understanding of PG physiology requires precise information about the structural organisation of its prinicipal morphological components. To solve these issues, we rely in our resesarch on the classical methods of histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy as well as on X-ray phase contrast micro-tomography imaging ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Nature is known to form a variety of  complex architectures with exquisite structural control. These include 2D mesoporous silica structures found in the cell walls of diatoms and 3D mesoporous crystalline calcite structures found in the cysts of some dinoflagellates. Both examples exhibit long-range morphological regularity, which is beyond the reach of current human technology. In the proposed experiment, we will apply nano-holotomography imaging method to follow the morphological evolution of commonly studied model species of diatoms and dinoflagellates with the goal of: (i) understanding the forces and thermodynamic constraints that govern the formation of highly regular 2D and 3D mesoporous biomineralized structures (morphogenesis); and (ii) correlating between the morphology and the mechanical performance of these architectures (function). During the last few decades, significant progress has been made in understanding key biochemical mechanisms responsible for biogenic mineral formation. However, little is known about the physical forces and thermodynamic constraints that regulate the morphogenesis of biomineralized tissue on the macroscopic scale. Our recent work shows that the formation of mineralized ultrastructures in a variety of calcium carbonate-and amorphous silica-based tissues is the result of a thermodynamically driven self-assembly processes.  To study the nano-architectures mentioned above, we used the holotomographic imaging method on the beamline ID16A-NI. The exceptionally small beam and the resulting nanometer-sized resolution matches well the approx. 100 nm feature size that we needed to resolve. We followed the morphological evolution of the two investigated organisms at five consequent stages of their formation. The imaging beamline ID16A-NI made it possible to perform zoom-projected imaging that was combined into phase-retrieved holotomographic reconstructions of the small samples. We investigated a total of 10 samples containing a number of frozen cells collected at 5 different stages of their development -five samples per organism. Furthermore, we performed both \"low\" resolution holotomographic overview scans and also local-tomography using the higher resolutions of the experimental setup, of 40 nm. The holotomography datasets were phase retrieved to quantify local structural variations in density and reconstructed to create 3D models of the cells at different stages of growth.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal is part of a larger project that will develop a novel biosensor, based on nanostructured biomimetic lipid membranes, to detect plasma protein biomarkers of severe pathologies. The project will characterise, at the nanoscale, the structure\/function relationship linked to the interaction of protein biomarkers with biologically relevant lipids. These interactions will be investigated by means of scattering techniques using large-scale facilities to optimise the lipid composition for specific biomarker detection. The aim of the project is to study at nanostructural level the interaction between the biomarker, soluble Vascular-Endothelial cadherin (sVE), and biologically relevant lipid bilayer membranes using X-ray scattering techniques, and particurlarly to identify how different lipids can affect this interaction to build a potential biosensor, in which this interaction is enhaced, that is aimed for early detection of scarce biomarkers in blood samples. These fundamental results will better elucidate the mechanism of interaction between protein and lipids and will set the basis for the development of biosensors aimed to optimise the sensitivity and reliability of biosensing techniques for biomarkers of tumours. In this context it is important to understand the effect of glycosylation since the majority of biomarkers of tumours are glycosylated. As reported in a previous related study  For each system we acquired various scans in different positions of the empty silicon substrate, the bilayer and the bilayer after the injection of the protein. The kinetic of absorption\/insertion of proteins was also studied. Examples of reduced and normalised reflectivity curves are reported in Figure  Data analysis is in progress and is performed using both the Motofit plug-in for Igor Pro and the software Refnx to check the consistency of results between programs. The sample systems are being modelled as a series of homogeneous slabs, each slab will be described by the four parameters thickness, SLD, roughness and solvent percentage or hydration in the layer. In particular, for the fit of the bilayer a 4 slabs model have been used, whereas various slabs models for the bilayers in presence of proteins have been tested. The different models tested for protein\/lipid bilayer interaction take into account the possibility of a protein adsorbed layer onto the SLB, a partial penetration of proteins into the outer headgroup layer and also a full penetration of proteins in the SLB with also an additional layer of proteins on top. So far, an in-depth analysis of the data has been performed for POPC and POPC\/DOTAP SLBs in presence of BSA. The model that seems to describe this data most appropriately is the one considering not only the adsorption of the protein on the bilayer, but a partial incorporation of the protein in the outer head region of the bilayer for which we report the example below (Figure  Complementary measurements with sVE on the last lipid composition tested (POPC\/SM\/CHOL 50:25:25) are still necessary. To further discriminate the effect of glycosylation on the interaction, we are willing to perform new synchrotron XRR experiments using different glycosylated proteins, such as alpha-fetoprotein (biomarker for liver cancer) and glycosylated BSA. The interaction with SLBs will be characterised using the same parameters and lipid compositions tested for the previous proteins. The results with the four different proteins will be compared and elucidation on the effect of glycosylation and impact of different lipids will be highlighted.

    "title":"Imaging joint biomechanics in growth and osteoarthritis",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Osteoarthritis is a major financial, social and healthcare burden. Our previous research has identified associations between growth plate cartilage phenotypes and osteoarthritis development. Further, we have developed new synchrotron X-ray imaging (sCT) technologies to allow determination of nanoscale mechanical strains in intact joints under loading using a unique mechanical loading rig (P2R). Here we will build on this work and examine our hypothesis that: growth plate cartilage dynamics and joint biomechanical functionality are intimately linked. We will apply loads to  young, adult and aged osteoarthritis-prone (STR\/Ort mice) and healthy (CBA wild-type mice) intact joints using the P2R and examine the subsequent strain patterns using our unique digital volume correlation code. We will then correlate these to hierarchical anatomical changes in joint tissue structures, to determine their interplay with the mechanical behaviour, and how these may underpin osteoarthritis development. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive, age-related degenerative musculoskeletal disease and a leading cause of pain and functional disability in older adults. OA affects approximately 7% of the global population with 10% of men and 18% of women over the age of 60 presenting with its symptoms, thus bearing significant socioeconomic and healthcare burdens  Whole fresh-frozen ex-vivo mouse hindlimbs from male STR\/Ort and CBA at ages prior to the onset of OA (8-11 weeks), at disease onset (20 weeks) and at advanced OA (40 weeks) (10) (N=6 per group), were thawed to room temperature before being mounted on a Deben CT500 compressive loading rig (Suffolk, UK), consisting of an open frame with two carbon-fibre pillars, between bespoke sample cups (figure  Using our ex vivo methods for knee joint loading with characterisation of strains from full-field sCT images, we find that applied loads predominate in the posterior region of the medial tibial plateu (10), which we have been able to isolate ahead of regionalised analyses following displacement by DVC (figure  Integrating the hierarchical anatomy of the knee joint with nanoscale strain patterning attained by DVC, made possible by high-resolution sCT imaging will enable us to further dissect the complex interplay between tissue physiology and biomechanics that contribute to joint demise in OA. Our preliminary analyses thus far have yielded interesting results and provide an indication that specific structural parameters could be correlated with localised strains across the tibia. Further studies will focus on strain analyses within the lateral and medial condyle of the femur (9, 14) using the sCT images acquired as part of proposal LS-3124. We then aim to establish the link between strain distribution within key structures of the joint with whole tibial and femoral shape analyses using BoneJ ",

    "title":"Metal imaging in Gram-negative bacteria: insights into mode of action of antibiotics",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Understanding antibiotic resistance is of urgent need and a current global problem. We study the use of nitroxoline (Nx) as an antibiotic against multi-drug bacteria. Our recent results show that Nx treatment perturbs metal homeostasis in Gram-negative bacteria by acting as an ionophore that drags distinct metals inside the cell, which leads to metal intoxiciaction and subsequent cell death. Consistent with this model, iron, zinc and manganese are significantly elevated in Nx exposed E. coli cells. However, currently there is no information on the metal localization in Nx treated cells. We hypothesize that certain metals (especially Fe, Zn, Mn) are not evenly distributed but stored in specific regions as shown for other bacteria. To address this question, we would like to use X-ray fluorescence nano-imaging in E. coli under Nx treatment and control conditions. This approach will be crucial to reveal the metal accumulation within the cells and elucidate the mode of action of Nx.  Metal imaging in Gram-negative bacteria: insights into mode of action of antibiotics  The dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a global threat of healthcare systems and novel therapeutic options are urgently needed as demanded by the WHO. We hence studied the repurposed drug nitroxoline (Nx) as a novel therapy option for infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria. We observed a high activity of Nx against Escherichia coli and other relevant pathogens. However, the mode of action of Nx is unclear. Based on our previous results, we hypothesized that Nx could act as an ionophore by transporting divalent metal ions (especially Fe, Zn, Mn) into E. coli. High amounts of Nx could perturb metal homeostasis leading to subsequent cell death. We indeed verified the accumulation of metal ions within the cells by employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). However, metal localization inside the cell is unknown. For bacteria like Deinococcus radiodurans, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) revealed that intracellular metal ions are not evenly distributed but stored in highly organized intracellular compartments, and this was essential for resistance against metal stress  We aimed to achieve the following objectives: (1) Impact of Nx on bacterial cell morphology (2) Confirmation of intracellular metal data obtained by ICP-MS (3) Novel insights into role of other biological relevant metals (4) Quantification of metals in Nx-resistant E. coli (5) Subcellular distribution of metals upon exposure of Nx At our institute, a Nx-resistant E. coli (Nx-R) was generated by evolution experiments for comparison purposes with an isogenic Nx-susceptible E. coli strain (Nx-S). E. coli strains were treated with Nx or DMSO as a control for different time points (0, 15 min, 1 h, 6 h) and Nx concentrations (0; 1 \u00b5g\/mL; 10 \u00b5g\/ml) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Antibiotic effect and cell numbers were quantified by live cell plating. At ESRF, cells were thawed and cell density adjusted with PBS after control by inverted light microscopy. Silica membranes were spotted with 10 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen (plunge freezing). Additionally, bacterial samples were freshly prepared (cultivation and Nx treatment) at the microbiological facility building (EMBL) due to moderate quality of various freeze plunged samples (e.g. ice crystals, low cell density, perturbed surface). XRF experiments were performed under cryo-conditions to obtain spectra and quantify elements by their Klevel emission lines. Low-resolution and fast-position mapping by combined X-ray phase contrast and XRF coarse scans in low-dose mode (6.1\u00d710 10 ph\/s) were performed using a scan step size of 300 \u00d7 300 nm 2 and a dwell time of 100 ms to identify bacteria. Thereafter, XRF fine scans in high-dose mode (2.49\u00d710 11 ph\/s) were done with a step size of either 30 \u00d7 30 or 15 \u00d7 15 nm 2 and a dwell time of 50 ms to obtain quantitative elemental density maps. After fitting and normalization of data, mean intracellular elemental area density were recorded for elements (e.g. Zn, Fe, Ca) and weighted 2D maps were created. Justification of beam time: The requested time of 12 shifts was continuously and comprehensively utilized. We were able to measure seven samples even though duration of measurement took longer than planned and despite several time-consuming technical obstacles (e.g. beam dumps, optimization of freeze plunging). Cell morphology: Comparison of Nx treated and untreated Nx-S E. coli revealed a significant reduction of the cell length after treatment with 10 \u00b5g\/ml Nx from 4.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5m to 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m. Data indicate an increase of manganese, zinc and (to a lesser extent) iron after Nx-treatment (Figure  Due to several time-consuming technical obstacles (e.g. quality of freeze plunged membranes, inhomogeneous cell morphology after 6 h and high Nx treatment, several beam dumps), we could just briefly analyse two samples of with Nx-R with only 1-5 scanned cells each. Comparison of treated and untreated Nx-R show a Nxinduced decrease of intracellular metal ions, indicating that Nx resistance is caused by a high activity of efflux pumps (Figure  Subcellular distribution of metals upon exposure of Nx: Two-dimensional mapping of intracellular metal localization revealed an accumulation of iron in specific areas in particular in the control without Nx treatment throughout the cell; in comparison, calcium or zinc, which seems to be evenly distributed in the cells (Figure  Using XRF nanoimaging, we demonstrated that the bacterial cell size decreased significantly in response to Nx treatment. We confirmed the Nx dependent accumulation of several metal ions in E. coli, which clearly supports the ionophore hypothesis on the mode of action of Nx. We furthermore, observed an increase of copper in the periplasm, which we will validate in functional assays. Our imaging data furthermore suggest that iron is present in certain compartments of the cell. However, due to the lack of 3D mapping, no further conclusions can be drawn and should hence be further investigated. Due to time constraints, the data on Nx-R are derived from few cells, but indicate that Nx leads to reduced intracellular metal content. Further analysis would gain new insights regarding the resistance mechanism. Moreover, we gained important insights on sample preparation and Nx treatment conditions of bacteria for XRF. We think that these data are encouraging and provide important new insights in the mode of action of Nx. The data are however not complete: (a) most of the results are derived from few cells, (b) the Nx-R strain could not be tested entirely, (c) and a 3D tomogram is missing. We would hence like to apply for a continuation proposal. ",

    "title":"Molecular structural basis of the effect of external load on the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal will use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to determine the contribution of novel regulatory mechanisms in the myosin-containing thick filaments in fast-twitch skeletal muscles of mammals to the performance of those muscles in response to changes in external load. The protocols will mimic the normal functions of human skeletal muscles in everyday life, providing the fundamental mechanistic understanding to underpin the development of novel therapies for muscle weakness. The ID02 beamline with Eiger 2-4M detector is uniquely suitable worldwide to determine the relevant molecular structural changes in isolated muscle. Science background. Development of novel therapies to combat muscle weakness in disease and the elderly is limited by a poor understanding of the normal mechanisms of muscle regulation. Muscle contraction is driven by sliding between thick (myosin-containing) and thin (actin-containing) filaments, triggered by a transient increase in calcium ion concentration in the muscle cells. The calcium ions bind to the thin filaments, causing a structural change that permits binding of the myosin motor domains to actin. However, this calcium\/thin filament signaling pathway does not control the strength, speed or metabolic cost of contraction 1 , which depend on a second class of regulatory mechanism that controls the availability of the myosin motors themselves. In resting muscle these motors are held in helical tracks on the surface of the thick filaments, with the motor domains folded back against the filament surface, making them unavailable for actin binding. Moreover, release of the motors from this helical folded conformation is triggered mechanically, by the strain in the filament 2 . This intrinsic mechano-sensing mechanism couples the number of active motors to the external load on the muscle, maximizing the efficiency of contraction. However, the structural basis of thick filament mechano-sensing and its coupling to thin filament regulation remain unknown. The aim of LS3147 was to determine the roles of both myosin-based and thin filament regulation in the response to a change in the external load on a muscle, either a decrease in load that allows muscle shortening and work production, or an increase in load that allows muscles to work as brakes when they are stretched. Experiments carried out during LS3417. Isolated intact extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles from the mouse were mounted vertically at ID02 in oxygenated Krebs solution at 27\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected with 2-ms time resolution on the Eiger 2X 4M detector. Sarcomere length was measured from the first-order sarcomere reflections with a muscle-to-detector distance of 31 m. In the shortening protocol, sarcomere length was set to 2.85 \u03bcm in the resting muscle. Muscles were stimulated repetitively for 120 ms; after 60 ms of fixed-end contraction, during which sarcomere length shortened to about 2.7 \u03bcm, unloaded shortening was allowed for 15 ms to sarcomere length about 2.3 \u03bcm, after which force developed at fixed muscle length. The actin-based second layer line, reporting the activation state of the thin filament, and the low-angle myosin-based reflections that report the activation state of the thick filament and the motor conformations 3-5 were recorded with a muscle-to-detector distance of either 3.2 or 2m. The intensity of the M3 reflection associated with the axial repeat of the myosin motors decreased rapidly at the start of unloaded shortening to about 10% of its tetanus plateau value, then recovered in parallel with force redevelopment after shortening. Its spacing reached a steady value of about 14.28 nm during shortening, significantly lower than its value at rest (14.34 nm). An additional reflection with a spacing of about 14.8 nm, not detectable at rest or at the tetanus plateau, appeared during unloaded shortening. This reflection also appears transiently at the start of stimulation 6 . The first myosin-based layer line recovered to about 30% of its resting value during unloaded shortening, signalling partial reformation of the helically ordered OFF motor conformation. The second actinbased layer line, signalling the azimuthal position of tropomyosin, also decreased substantially during unloaded shortening, more than halfway towards its resting value. These results show that the activation level of both the thick and thin filaments decreases during unloaded shortening, consistent with mechano-sensing in the thick filaments, activation of thin filaments by myosin binding, and positive coupling between the regulatory states of the thin and thick filaments. A second set of time-resolved experiments in which the same X-ray measurements were made using a ramp stretch applied at the plateau of a fixed-end contraction are currently being analysed.",

Recent progress in the group of co-proposer T. Br\u00fcgmann has allowed to keep slices of pig heart tissue in culture for several days, and to use this setup to address questions in cardiac electrophysiology, vegetative physiology and to explore new treatment options including optogenetic termination of cardiac arrhythmia [2,3]. In this proposal, we want to use SAXS with highly brilliant radiation and scanning X-ray diffraction with micro-focused undulator radiation to evaluate the changes of the cultured slices over time and as a function of mechanical loading (prestress, mechanical stimulation). meridional and equatorial reflections at 3m as well as multiple sarcomere reflections at 31m detector distance (not shown). During the ID02 beamtime, further cardiac sample systems weree measured. Since the import authorization had just been granted, we could also scan human heart tissue slices for comparison. Furhter, we also measured isolated and chemically fixed adult (murine) cardiomyocytes in a wet chamber. This served partly as control, and also as a survey of signal levels for cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. The results show that scanning diffraction with relaxed beam size in the range of a few tens of microns still allows to disciminate between individual cells and can reasonably complement scanning diffraction with spot sizes of a few microns or in the sub-micron range, as used in our previous work ",

    "title":"Iron localization and speciation in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous intracellular parasite, able to infect almost all warm blooded species and most cell types. This promiscuity requires sophisticated mechanisms to sense, subvert and store nutrients from host cells. Iron is an essential element for almost all life on earth, including T. gondii, however the reactivity which makes it so valuable in enzymatic reactions can be harmful to cells. For this reason, iron is tightly regulated and carefully stored within cells, however the mechanisms by which divergent eukaryotes such as Toxoplasma do this are largely unknown. We are interested in iron in the context of T. gondii infection, specifically where iron is stored within the cells and how infection modulates the host cell iron response. Using the facility at the ESRF, we hope to resolve these questions and determine for the first time how and where iron is stored in the parasite and how it alters the iron balance of the host cell Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite that can infect all warm-blooded species. Infection is of significant clinical and veterinary relevance worldwide, having both economic and public health consequences. Toxoplasma is arguably the most successful pathogen in the world, infecting 30% of the population worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, infection is asymptomatic, however, the disease is dangerous in immunocompromised individuals and to the developing foetus, resulting in congenital defects or miscarriages. Iron is an essential nutrient for almost all organisms. Iron acquisition systems of many bacteria are important for pathogenesis  Toxoplasma must acquire iron from the host cell it is infecting. However, the mechanisms of iron uptake, as well as subcellular transport of iron have not been previously studied in Toxoplasma gondii. We have recently shown that an iron transporter (VIT) is required for iron storage in Toxoplasma, disruption of this transporter makes the cells hypersensitive to excess iron and prevents virulence of the parasite 1 . However, although iron uptake and storage are required for Toxoplasma, the mechanism of iron uptake remains unknown. Previous studies in the related eukaryotic parasite, Plasmodium, identified a transporter, named ZIPCO which is believed to be involved in the uptake of iron  As ZIPCO is predicted to be essential for parasite survival, we have generated a cell line which allows for inducible knockdown of this major iron transporter. We also generated a parasite cell line which overexpresses this transporter (unpublished results). However, much remains unknown about how the parasite acquires iron and transports it. The proposal therefore aimed at mapping the localisation of iron in wildtype parasites as well as our transporter mutants at a subcellular resolution. We also aimed at determining the speciation of iron within the wildtype parasite as well as the effect of the mutant iron transporter on the distribution of iron. Although parasite host modulation in the context of iron is not well studied in T. gondii, infection of macrophages by the intravacuolar parasite Leishmania impairs macrophage iron homeostasis. Intracellular Leishmania donovani manipulate iron uptake mechanisms by macrophages by directly scavenge iron from the labile iron pool (LIP) of macrophages, enabling the parasite to utilize it for it's intracellular growth  We requested 12 shifts on ID21 to analyse 10 samples. The samples were the following: \u2022 Uninfected Bone Marrow Derived Macrophage's (BMDMs) \u2022 BMDMs infected with wildtype T. gondii \u2022 BMDMs infected with T.gondii overexpressing the major iron transporter ZIPCO \u2022 Uninfected RAW murine macrophages 24h \u2022 RAW murine macrophages infected with wildtype T. gondii \u2022 Extracellular wildtype T. gondii \u2022 Extracellular wildtype T. gondii pretreated with ferric ammonium citrate \u2022 Extracellular T. gondii overexpressing the major iron transporter ZIPCO \u2022 T. gondii where the major iron transporter has not been knocked down \u2022 T. gondii where the major iron transporte, ZIPCO, has been knocked down For each sample we aimed to obtain one coarse map at 2 x 2 \u00b5m, 1 fine map at 300 nm resolution (approx. 3 h) and then about 100 scans for XANES (approx. 2 h) on selected samples. In infected cells, XANES were taken from the background, intracellular parasites, extracellular parasites as well as the host cell. This aimed to give us the resolution needed to map our element of interest (primarily iron) at a subcellular resolution, and to determine the valence of iron, in both infected host cells and in the parasite. We successfully obtained approx. 800 XANES spectra, across all samples (including background scans). We also obtained 213 MAPS (at various resolutions). At the highest resolution we are able to localise iron within the parasite (Fig.  Using our transporter mutant, we were able to quantify iron from parasites and demonstrate for the first time that depletion of ZIPCO lead to undetectable levels of iron within the parasites (Fig.  We were also successful in examining the valence of iron within the parasite. Although more detailed analysis will be performed, we can see that parasite spectra cluster more closely with Fe-oxalate than the Fe-foil standard on a PCA plot (Fig.  The valence of parasite iron is also clearly distinct from host cell iron stores (Fig.  We also find that although BMDMs infected with wildtype T. gondii (red) cluster close together with uninfected BMDMs (green), BMDMs infected with parasites that overexpress the major iron transporter ZIPCO (blue), cluster distinctly to BMDMs uninfected\/infected with wildtype Toxoplasma (Fig.  Figure  In conclusion, the main findings of this study supports that T. gondii acquires iron through the action of the ZIPCO transporter. For the first time, we show that in the absence of ZIPCO, Toxoplasma have significantly less iron compared to wildtype parasites. We also find that parasites that were pretreated with iron, cluster distinctly from wildtype parasites. There was also a clear difference in clustering between BMDMs that were infected with wildtype parasites and BMDMs that were infected with T. gondii that overexpressed ZIPCO, suggesting that parasites that overexpress this iron transporter may be playing a role in modulating the host cell iron following infection. Further analysis on this data is required to understand the mechanisms of parasite host modulation in the context of iron in more detail. The results obtained from this proposed study are very important and central to apicomplexan metal biology. It is currently not known how the parasite takes up iron and how it modules the host cell iron following infection. The results obtained from our first visit to the ESRF in 2022 allow us, for the first time, to start to understand the mechanisms by which T. gondii acquires iron from the host, and how the parasite modulates iron in the host cell at a subcellular resolution. As iron is critical for both the parasite as well as the immune response, it is important to understanding this battle for this essential metal. Further understanding this has the potential to suggest novel strategies for the control of these parasites.",

    "title":"Molecular structural basis of relaxation in skeletal muscle",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Rapid relaxation following active contraction is essential to the efficient performance of both skeletal and cardiac muscle, but its mechanistic basis is poorly understood. The well-known decrease in intracellular calcium concentration is necessary but not sufficient for rapid relaxation, and there is likely to be an additional mechanical trigger. This proposal will use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to characterise the molecular structural changes in the muscle filaments during the relaxation of skeletal muscles of mammals, and their dependence on imposed mechanical perturbations. The results will help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, underpinning the development of novel therapies for disease in both skeletal muscle and in the heart. Report: Muscle contraction is driven by sliding between thick (myosin-containing) and thin (actin-containing) filaments, and triggered by a transient increase in calcium ion concentration in the muscle cells. The calcium ions bind to the thin filaments, causing a structural change that permits binding of the myosin motor domains to actin, providing a start signal for contraction. The strength, speed and metabolic cost of contraction are controlled by a second set of regulatory structural changes in the thick filaments in which the myosin motors are released from the helical folded conformation on the surface of the thick filaments that made them unavailable for binding actin in resting muscle 1 . Release of the motors from the helical folded state is triggered mechanically, by the strain in the thick filament 2 . This intrinsic mechano-sensing mechanism couples the number of active motors to the external load on the muscle, maximizing the efficiency of contraction. The positive feedback loop implicit in this mechanism, together with the fact that actin-bound motors can themselves activate the thin filaments in a second positive feedback loop, are likely to have evolved to maximise the speed of muscle activation. Conversely, they are strongly detrimental to rapid muscle relaxation following the falling phase of the calcium transient. The mechanisms by which muscle escapes these positive feedback loops in order to relax rapidly have remained mysterious, although they are known to involve a phase transition from slow 'isometric relaxation', in which the filaments are locked in an activated state, to 'chaotic relaxation', involving transient yielding of local regions of the muscle cell 3 . The yield point is also mechanically determined, but the molecular structural basis of the yield process is unknown and it has received little attention, despite the fact that rapid relaxation is essential to the normal performance of both skeletal and cardiac muscle and is impaired in muscle disease. Better understanding of the normal mechanisms of relaxation is needed to underpin the development of improved therapies for muscle disease. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction uniquely provides nm-scale resolution of changes in filament structure and myosin motor conformation on the millisecond timescale in living muscles in physiological conditions  The upgraded ID02 beamline with Eiger 2-4M detector is currently the best facility worldwide for such studies. In particular, the combination of large area and small pixel size of this detector allows the intensity of the actin-based second layer line, reporting the activation state of the thin filament, to be recorded at the same time as the low-angle myosin-based reflections that report the activation state of the thick filament and the motor conformations. The ability to move the detector between 2.0 and 31 m in the same experiment allows sarcomere length to be measured in the same preparations and protocols, a capability unique to this beamline. In LS 3206 isolated intact extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the mouse were dissected at the animal facility of the beamline ID17 and then transferred to the beamline ID02, where they were mounted vertically at sarcomere length 2.4\u00b5m at ID02 in a temperature-controlled trough in oxygenated Krebs solution at 27\u00b0C. Electrical stimulation, force measurement, and control of muscle length used the standard methods of our lab 6 . X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with the Eiger 2-4M detector. X-ray exposure was controlled using fast shutters and monitored with a pin diode. The muscle was moved vertically between exposures to reduce radiation damage. Data were analysed with SAXS utilities (M. Sztucki, ESRF), SAXS Package (P. Boesecke, ESRF) and Igor Pro (WaveMetrix Inc). Muscles were stimulated repetitively at 130 Hz for 100 ms at 27\u00b0C, with a recovery period of 3 min between successive contractions. Before the stimulus muscles were stretched by 5% in 8 ms in order to investigate the hypothesis that the resting state is stabilized by binding of the N-termini of myosin binding protein-C to the thin filaments whilst its C terminus is strongly bound to the thick filaments. The 5% stretch would be expected to detach these links. Muscle length was held fixed during the stimulation and for the first 15 ms after stimulation, during which intracellular calcium concentration decreases substantially 7 . Ramp shortening of 5% was then imposed in 8 ms to reduce force to zero, and thereby determine the role of mechano-sensing in relaxation. We recorded an average of 40 runs per muscle in 10 muscles including fixedend controls, using a combination of 2.0, 3.2m and 31m sample-to-detector distances and 2-ms time frames (1.8ms live time). We measured the second actin-based layer line that reports the azimuthal position of tropomyosin from the 2.0-m data. We measured changes in equatorial reflections, myosin-based layer lines, myosin-based meridional reflections (in particular the interference fine-structure of the M3 reflection from the axial repeat of the myosin motors that also reveals the region of the thick filament in which motors are activated ",

    "title":"Molecular bases of regulation of cardiac muscle contractility",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Regulation of heart contractility is operated by both thin, actin containing filaments, and thick, myosin containing filaments. Ca2+-induced structural changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament release the actin sites for interaction with myosin motors. Thick filament mechanosensing adapts to the load the number of motors recruited from the OFF state in which they lie tilted back on their tails unable to interact with actin. In the heartbeat both thin and thick filament activations are under the control of modulatory mechanisms by accessory proteins. Mutations in these proteins cause dysregulation and cardiomyopathy. We use sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray diffraction on intact and demembranated myocytes of the ventricle of wild type, mutant and transgenic animal models to investigate the mechanisms that control thick filament regulation\/dysregulation and test small molecules candidate as therapeutic tools. sarcomere length, upon activation titin in the A band increases its stiffness by 100 time, in this way becoming able to control the orientation of myosin motors in relation to the load (11). However, the classical view of the Starling has been recently reaffirmed in demembranated bundles dissected from the papillary muscle of Yucatan mini-pig showing that, at 22\u00b0C and without recovering the native lattice dimension thick filament is activated at low Ca 2+ by SL increase from 2 to 2.2 \u00b5m (12). Considering the lack in that experiment of the requirements for preserving the OFF state of myosin motors in demembranated fibres  Lowering temperature from 37 to 12\u00b0C, t h e analysis of X-ray data so far shows: (i) decrease of the intensity ratio of the 1,1 over the 1,0 equatorial reflections; (ii) decrease of the intensity (to 1\/3) and the spacing (by 0.35%) of the M3 reflection; (iii) increase of the spacing of the M6 reflection by 0.38% and (iv) decrease of the intensity of the first myosin layer by 5-fold. All these changes indicate, in agreement with previous findings on intact skeletal and cardiac muscle, that cooling produces a progressive disruption of the OFF state of the thick filament, with motor moving away from the ordered helical tracks on the surface of the thick filament. Conclusions. The intact trabecula from the porcine ventricle is a suitable preparation to investigate the structural dynamics of thick filament activation with the same \u03b2-cardiac myosin isoform as in the human ventricle.",

    "title":"Towards improved spin qubit quality: Low temperature determination of strain fluctuations in Si\/SiGe induced by metal surface electrodes",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We aim to investigate the strain fluctuations induced by TiN electrodes in epitaxial Si\/SiGe quantum well (QW) heterostructures for housing of spin qubits. For this, we employ Scanning Xray Diffraction Microscopy (SXDM) at low temperature. Strain fluctuations are expected to cause variations in the local electromagnetic potential in the QW, which will strongly influence the qubit performance. Qubits are operated at cryogenic temperatures, while the strain is dependent on temperature due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion. Thus measurements at low temperature are necessary to determine the strain distribution which will affect the qubit. We will compare the experimental results with Finite Element (FEM) simulations based on an edge-force model. We have chosen TiN as an electrode material because it is commonly used in CMOS processes, which are suitable due to their technological maturity to fabricate large arrays of qubits with homogenous properties. The aim of this proposal was to characterize the local strain and tilt fluctuations within epitaxial Si0.7Ge0.3 \/ 10 nm Si \/ Si0.7Ge0.3 heterostructures (Fig.  During the experiment, the X-ray energy was set to 10.0 keV. The focussing optics for the beam consisted of Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP), Beam Stop (BS) and Order Sorting Aperature (OSA). The focal distance was determined as 145.18 mm. The piezo scanners were placed below the OSA to scan the beam rather than the sample in order to perform mappings on samples in the cryostat. An energy resolved X-ray fluorescence detector was mounted to measure fluorescence signals simultaneously to the diffraction. The fluorescence from the Ni markers and the TiN electrodes was expected to be detected at the K-edges of Ni and Ti respectively, however it was not measureable at the detector settings corresponding to these energies. It was only possible to detect both signals together in the integrated fluorescence signal, which was still suitable for tracking the QuBus during the measurement (Fig.  \uf0b7 MUSST card: First one, then both \"cnt\" inputs, which were required for recording the signals of fluorescence detector and beam intensity monitor respectively, stopped functioning. The issue could be solved, but this required ca. 1.5 shifts. \uf0b7 Beam loss: Occured twice, once briefly and for several hours due to power failure. Together the two beam losses cost ca. 0.5 shifts. \uf0b7 Center of rotation (COR): Depending on the azimuthal angle \u03a6 , the COR seemingly moved its position. The spatial drift in both x-and y-direction with the sample rocking angle \u03b7 varied with \u03a6. The drift in the direction within the scattering plane could be compensated by adjusting the sample height but in not the orthogonal direction. The reason for this issue is still unkown. The increased alignment overhead cost ca. 1 shift \uf0b7 Loss of alignment: The alignment was lost on multiple occasions due to a cause which was unknown at the time. During the last day, it was discovered that movements of the FZP in fzpx (x-coordinate) were not reproducible. Movement of the FZP along fzpx lead to loss of alignment. The repeated losses cost ca. 1 shift In total, three samples were investigated at RT only during this beam time. For each sample, around a QuBus three KMAPs were recorded for three different Bragg reflections from the {3 3 5} family of planes. By overlapping the KMAPs for the different reflections it will be possible to determine the 3D lattice parameters in both in the thin Si QW and the thick Si0.7Ge0.3 buffer. This will allow for independent, model-free calculations of 3D strains and tilts in both layers. A preliminary analysis of two succesful measurements on one sample already demonstrates that the strain fields around the electrodes are resolved by KMAP. Thus in conclusion, the measurements at RT functioned as planned and provide useful data. A comparison of the strain maps for the three different samples will provide information as to which parameters are most relevant for minimizing strain fluctuations in an epitaxial heterostructure for housing spin qubits. However, due to various issues, in particular the instability of the cryostat, the planned measurements at croygenic temperatures could not be carried out. Since the local strain fluctuations at low T are of particular relevance for qubits, it is of high interest to re-attempt a similar experiment during a later beam time.",

    "title":"Nanoparticles of metal-metalloid compounds: studying their reactivity in molten salts to discover functional solids",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims at unveiling the chemical reactivity of nanoparticles in inorganic liquids, ie. molten salts, which are highly relevant to design new materials for electrocatalysis applied to energy conversion. Because these liquids operate between 300 and 700\u00b0C, they require special approaches in order to probe reactions in situ. Herein we want to understand structural transformations of metal nanoparticles when they react with boron and phosphorus in molten salts, and to evidence the formation of new solids with potentially high impact for energy conversion. In situ time resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering (PDF analysis) will enable evaluating the composition and temperature ranges where intermediates and new solids, including amorphous phases, form and then crystallize during the reaction. These data will unveil new solids and nanomaterials and provide the first understanding of reaction mechanisms into molten salts. 1. Objectives In this experiment, we have scrutinized by in situ X-ray diffraction chemical reactions into inorganic molten salts. The aim was two-fold: (1) Understand phase transformations during the reaction of metal nanoparticles with metalloid sources, which yield ex situ nanoparticles of compounds highly relevant for electrocatalysis of water splitting; (2) Screen reaction conditions in the search for new phases occuring as intermediate during reactions, in order to identify the conditions of their synthesis ex situ in the lab. The high flux and high energy 90 keV incident beam accessible at ID11 was necessary to assess the systems of interest mainly for two reasons: (i) the chemical species of interest were diluted; (2) the molten salt media were alkali and alkaline earth halides, highly X-ray absorbing. The experiment was the first opportunity to test on site a new capillary oven we have designed for performing reactions into molten salts while enabling in situ analysis. The first shift of the experiment was dedicated to setting up the oven on the beamline (Figure  We have studied 40 reactions to explore the reaction between nickel precursors (metal nanoparticles or salts) with a boron source (NaBH4) and a silicon source (Na4Si4) or a phosphorus source (phosphines or red phosphorus). These experiments provided very beneficial results to (1) identify the crystallization sequences during reactions and then the conditions required for ex situ selective synthesis of a given phase; (2) explore in only one synthesis the whole temperature range at given positions in the composition spaces, in order to identify possible new metastable compounds. A typical set of data acquired during heating is displayed Figure  In another series of experiments, we have assessed the possibility to monitor the synthesis of iron boride FeB nanoparticles in a molten LiCl-KCl mixtures. Figure  These results also show that we can study the crystallization of Fe-and B-based nanomaterials. This is particularly interesting in the perspective of further experiments in the future, for assessing the synthesis conditions for Fe-based 2D materials.  Overall, the experiment was fruitful in the following sense: -It validated the design of our multipurpose oven for high temperature liquid-phase reactions. It also enabled identifying the future tracks for optimization. -It allowed identifying the crystallization sequence, then the formation mechanisms of several binary and ternary metal-p block elements. This knowledge sheds a new light on reaction mechanisms in molten salts. It will also enable selecting the conditions for ex situ synthesis of nanomaterials that could not be reached before, thus hindering the study of their properties. -Further analysis is now required to track the appearance of unidentified XRD peaks, which might indicate the occurrence of new compounds, which will then require further work for identification. This was the first experiment of the group on ID11. The local team provided excellent conditions for the experiment, and was very helpful for data retrieval and analysis. There were a series of loss of computer connection with the hutch, which resulted overall in the loss of 1 shift. Except this problem, the outcome of the experiment is very positive. Further data analysis is on the way to initiate rapidly the writing of a scientific paper on these first findings.",

    "title":"Relation between the catalytic efficiency, morphology and chemical state of Cu catalyst in high-rate CO2 conversion devices for low-carbon e",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Large-scale utilization of electrochemical CO 2 conversion to value-added chemicals and artificial fuels requires high reaction rates (i.e. high current densities). This can be achieved using Cu catalyst in GDE (Gas Diffusion Electrode) flow electrolyzers, overcoming the mass transport limitations. While Cu catalyst behaviour in traditional cells is well described, it is not clear how this knowledge translates into the advanced GDEs configuration as this arrangement was proposed only very recently. In this proposal, we aim to fundamentally understand the relation between the catalytic efficiency and selectivity, local reaction environments, morphology and chemical state of Cu in GDEs at commercially-relevant current densities. This study will provide rational guidance for improving the performance of GDE based high-rate CO2 conversion devices for low-carbon economy. The aim of beamtime MA-4791 (and the following in-house time) was to investigate multiple aspects of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) based CO 2 electrolysis (CO 2 E). The results obtained from this work will be used to understand the mechanisms behind changes in product selectivity over time. For this purpose, a special electrolysis cell was developed in a collaboration between ESRF ID31 staff and DTU Physics. The cell was thoroughly tested at DTU for electrochemical performance. The first step during the beam was to familiarize, align, and calibrate the cell along with the different components from an X-ray imaging and diffraction perspective. Hereafter, a series of in-operando experiments were performed in order to investigate the following: 1. Initial native copper oxide (CuO) reduction to Cu 2. Variation in water content of the cathode catalyst and gas diffusion layer during electrolysis operation The cell is an MEA type electrolysis cell designed with a casing sufficiently X-ray transparent to execute inoperando investigations of the MEA itself. The MEA is an assembly of two gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) directly in contact with each side of an anion exchange membrane (AEM). In all experiments, the cathode GDE contained a 150 nm sputtered copper catalyst layer, and the anode was a commercial IrO 2 coated GDE. Figure  The surface of the Cu catalyst will unavoidably oxidize during the manufacturing and handling in an air\/oxygen environment, and it has been discussed 1 if this oxide layer was important to the performance of the catalyst. Therefore, the first thing investigated was the reduction of the initial native copper oxide (Cu 2 O) layer. As the crystal structure of Cu 2 O and Cu is different, the reduction process can be observed as a change in the diffracted pattern. Figure  It is expected that water (electrolyte) flooding of the catalyst layer and the GDE impacts cell performance significantly, therefore, a series of in-operando experiments were performed at varying current densities. A total of 9 (3 h) experiments were successfully performed, and the preliminary data analysis indicates a correlation between cell potential and water content in the cathode gas diffusion layer. Figure  The morphology of the catalysts layer was continuously investigated using SAXS, but our preliminary analysis of the data does not show any indication of changes. As the catalyst used was sputtered Cu, we did not expect to observe any significant change in morphology. Our experiments clarified the timeframe in which the initial Cu 2 O layer reduces during CO 2 E. Additionally, a large amount of experiments shows the correlation between water content in the cathode GDE and the cell potential of the CO 2 electrolyzer. An increase in water content at the cathode GDE also correlates with the increase in hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, the catalyst morphology was analyzed and did not show any significant change. In general, the results from the beamtime are highly satisfactory and the quality of our data is excellent. We expect to publish at least two scientific articles based on the obtained results and hope that the work can be continued in the future.",

For instance, Ag2S QDs might serve as the core of nanoplatforms for imaging, drug delivery and therapy. The bottleneck in the development of QD-based nanoplatforms is the lack of information about their stability in biological environments and their biocompatibility. This proposal aims at providing an insightful structural and chemical characterization of Ag2S QDs designed and synthesized in our laboratory. The influence of the coating on the stability in vitro, including in simulated biological media, will be assessed. This will allow us to identify QD formulations that are potentially of interest for the development of novel NIR emitting labels for biomedical applications. according to a TEM characterization. The size is proportional to the reaction time, which was 1h or 2h for GSH-Ag2S, and 30m or 1h30m for Pen-Ag2S. The four QD were measured as synthesized in water (samples labeled \"wat\"), after 24h in cell culture medium (labeled \"med\"), or after 24h in hepatic cells (labeled \"cell\"), in order to probe the stability of these engineered nanomaterials in biological media. As reference samples we used a previously characterized Ag(I)-GSH complex (5 mM) in solution,  The concentration of the \"wat\" samples was in the range 1-4 mM (~100-400 ppm): the EXAFS spectra could be measured on all \"wat\" samples, but the least concentrated ones required a long integration time (up to 9 scans to be merged in the final spectrum). In some \"med\" and \"cell\" samples that were not concentrated enough to acquire the EXAFS spectra, only the XANES region was scanned up to 25.70 keV. The experimental spectra of the \"wat\" samples are reported in Fig.  The EXAFS spectra of the QD, as extracted in the reciprocal space (Fig.  Finally, we could compare the XAFS spectra of the four QDs formulations in water, after 24h in cell culture medium, and after 24h or 72h in hepatic cells. No difference is observed in the XANES spectra of the samples in the different conditions. When the EXAFS spectra could be acquired and extracted, small differences seem to arise in the first spectra after 72h in cells, indicating a possible small deformation of the average coordination sphere of silver (Figure  This study contributed to identify promising engineered nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

Varying these concentrations allows modifying properties of TiOy, and one of the ways to do this is to apply extreme conditions like high pressure (HP) and\/or high temperature (HT). Besides, also nanosize effect can influence behavior of structural vacancies. Thus, within this project we want to study nanocrystalline TiOy at extreme conditions. Obtained experimental data will reveal both size effect and effect of extreme conditions on vacancy concentration and crystal structure, and expand our studies of electronic properties of nano- and microcrystalline TiOy. Obtained during experiment XRD patterns for nano-and microcrystalline TiO y powders are presented in Figures  One of the most important and interesting results obtained from the experiment are the following: 1. The highest obtained value of TiO y lattice parameter a equals 4.208 \u00c5 and was obtained at the point of the simultaneous application of highest pressure (11 GPa) and temperature (~2000 K).

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The scientific objectives of the proposed experiments are to decrypt fundamental mechanisms of the solidification of crystalline silicon (Si) for photovoltaic (PV) applications. The original experiments consist of synchrotron X-ray imaging (radiography and diffraction imaging\/topography) applied to the in situ monitoring of Si solidification. The main issues of the defect formation, ranging from dislocations to grains, and of their complex interaction and dependence will be studied at high temperatures during heating, melting (1414\u00b0C) and solidification. These experiments will generate original and key fundamental results. Moreover, this knowledge can contribute to answer to the challenge of defect control to obtain higher PV efficiency for all most advanced fabrication processes of crystalline Si PV cells. The scientific objectives of the proposed experiments were to decrypt fundamental mechanisms of the solidification of crystalline silicon (Si) for photovoltaic (PV) applications. The original experiments at the basis of this work consist of synchrotron X-ray imaging (radiography and diffraction imaging\/topography) applied to the in situ monitoring of Si during seed heating, partial melting, solidification and cooling down. The main issues of the defect formation, ranging from dislocations to grains, and of their complex interaction and dependence is thus studied up to high temperatures (melting temperature of silicon: 1414\u00b0C). The key fundamental results obtained can contribute to answer to the challenge of defect control to obtain higher PV efficiency for all most advanced fabrication processes of crystalline Si PV cells. The experiments were carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at beam line ID19. The beamline is ideally suited for this experiment because of the large field of view and of the excellent and uniform flux of photons. The IM2NP device named GaTSBI (Growth at high Temperature observed by Synchrotron Beam Imaging) was used for the experiments. This high temperature furnace allows Si heating in solid phase \/ melting \/ solidification and is compatible with X-ray synchrotron imaging methods: radiography and topography. In the radiography mode, the sample is illuminated by the white synchrotron X-ray beam. Radiography enables characterising in situ and in real-time the morphology and dynamic evolution of the solid\/liquid interface during solidification, and measuring growth kinetics. The beam is monochromatised after the sample in order to keep a constant heat load on the sample; the radiograph image is recorded by a camera. In the simultaneous diffraction imaging mode, topographs are collected and allow to reveal grain orientation, twinning, crystal network deformation and dislocation related strain fields as shown in our previous work  Monocrystalline Si seeds with several crystallographic orientations were selected and diffraction spots of interest to reveal strain field and defects were sorted out according to our previous work and during the experimental campaign. Three main related topics were addressed during the MA4859 experiments: 1. Dislocation formation and propagation: For this thematic, a pure mono-crystalline seed was used. The development of dislocations during heating of the seed is first studied in isothermal conditions to characterise the dynamics of dislocations. Then, a temperature gradient iss established to partially melt the sample. At last, solidification is initiated from the remaining solid seed to study the propagation of the dislocations at the seed-regrowth interface, during solidification at the solid-liquid interface and the interaction of dislocations with other structural defects. 2. Sub-grain propagation and evolution during solidification: For this thematic, a sample initially containing subgrains was used as a seed for solidification. It is worth noting that subgrains are major defects for the photovoltaic industry. These investigations are part of a collaboration with INES (National Institute of Solar Energy). The interaction of subgrain boundaries with the solid-liquid interface is studied as well as their evolution during solidification. 3. Effect of silicon nitride crucible coating on solidification: For this thematic, silicon nitride coating was deposited on the boron nitride crucibles generally used in our experiments. This coating is the most widely used in the industry for the fabrication of multi-crystalline silicon ingots. The objective was to study nucleation and solidification in the presence of this industrial coating. This is part of the project FUSING (Fundamentals of Silicon Nucleation and Growth -PhC N\u00b0 45310UH) in collaboration between IM2NP and the group of Pr Marisa Di Sabatino at NTNU in Norway. During this campaign, these challenging, cutting-edge in situ experiments were successfully conducted at temperatures ranging from room temperature to the melting temperature of Si (1414 \u00b0C). From a more technical point of view, the challenge to record simultaneously radiographs and two diffraction spots have been met. An example of images recorded during the campaign is shown in Figure  The GaTSBI set-up coupled with the ID19 imaging environment together with the experience of both ID19 and IM2NP teams are unique tools to answer to the major issues of crystalline defect formation during growth of materials at high temperature in general. Following the success from the experimental point of view, we would like to take advantage of this unique association between the GaTSBI solidification furnace and advanced X-ray imaging to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms at stake during silicon process steps. As mentionned above, the results obtained during the June 2021 experiments are still under analysis and we expect key results concerning the understanding of defect formation during the heating and solidification of silicon. The scientific thematics presented here are of current interest in industry and in research laboratories and require further investigations. They have been clearly identified by the team and will be further studied in the future.",

    "title":"Probing the protein corona around colloidal metal nanoparticles in cellular environments using nanofocused X-ray synchrotron radiation",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Metal NPs are organised in metal core, surface coating, and protein corona. Optical microscopy suggests that degradation of these elements in cells occurs at different rates, but fluorescence probes can detach or get degraded. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using nanofocused X-ray is ideal to study the localisation of metal NPs with subcellular resolution. Recently, we developed a method to label surface coatings of NPs with brominated tags. This allowed performing XRF and XANES that confirmed differential cellular degradation of cores and coatings of Au NPs after long incubations. Yet, we do not know what happen at short incubations, or with the protein corona formed around those NPs. We want to use XRF maps in cells treated with colloidal NPs at ID16A to probe the relative localisation between Au cores, Br coatings and Gd-labelled proteins. This will provide new insight into the cellular degradation process of colloidal NPs, which is important to assess their potential as biomedical tools. behavior was observed after 24 h in cellular environment. The gold to gadolinium ratio increased by a factor of two within the first 24 h treatment. Again, these results could indicate the dynamic exchange of secreted cellular proteins with the preformed Gd labeled CTPR protein forming the initial corona. Overall, the XRF maps of cells treated with pegylated AuNPs surrounded by a labeled protein corona showed the presence of vesicular transport of the hybrid particles, indicated by accumulation of gold and gadolinium in nearly spherical structures in sizes smaller then 1 \u00b5m (compare Fig.  XRF mapping at ID16A shows the possibility of intracellular probing small nanoparticle protein interactions with sub-cellular resolution at relatively low elemental concentrations. The overall analysis supports the hypothesis of the time dependent protein corona disintegration after cellular internalization. However, the small population of these studies, i.e., three cells per condition, suffer from a huge intrinsic cellular variability and thus not allow to determine proper statistic. Currently we are establishing a label for the nanoparticle surrounding ligand to probe the individual intracellular disintegration of gold nanoparticles, stabilizing ligands and protein corona at the same time, which is crucial to understand for future nanomedical applications. Building on the results obtained at ID16A, we are confident to probe our improved system in future XRF mapping and\/or tomography experiments. Thereby we will focus on shorter time points and more cells per condition, which is feasible by faster acquisition times due ongoing upgrades at synchrotron facilities.",

    "title":"Green Steel: The Evolution of Porosity during Hydrogen-Based Direct Reduction of Iron Oxide",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Hydrogen-based direct reduction (H-DR) of iron oxide has attracted immense attention as a promising alternative to producing green steel and mitigating CO2 emission in the steel industry. During H-DR, the volume mismatch between the educt and product phases results in the generation of a large number of pores. Thorough time-resolved 3D characterization of the porosity and the connectivity of the free volume is highly needed for understanding their effects on the reaction kinetics. Hereby, we propose to employ in-situ high-resolution X-ray computed tomography enhanced by phase contrast to fully disclose and quantify the evolution of local microstructures during H-DR of iron oxide, in particular, the size, morphology, distribution, and 3D connectivity of porosity. This information will be further correlated with the reaction kinetics, paving the way to speeding up the solid-gas reaction by the microstructural design of ore pellets as well as thermomechanical process optimization. Fossil-fuel-free ironmaking is indispensable for reducing massive anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the steel industry. Hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) is among the most attractive solutions for green ironmaking, with high technology readiness. In HyDR, pelletized solid iron ores (hematite and magnetite) are reduced by hydrogen gas. Reaction kinetics is affected by micro-to-atomic-scale features of the different oxides and the adjacent iron layers, including crystal defects, porosity, mechanics, and local composition  In this study, we performed in-situ high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) enhanced by phase contrast to characterize the porosity and the adjacent phases at the beamline ID16B during the direct reduction of iron oxide with pure hydrogen. The needle-shaped specimens (with a diameter of ~100 \u00b5m) were prepared from direct-reduction pellets and single-crystal hematite, then they were encapsulated in a hydrogen atmosphere with quartz capillaries. The high-temperature reduction experiments were conducted by heating up the encapsulated specimens using a microheater at the beamline to 700 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C. The spatial resolution of the CT experiments was set as 30 nm by adjusting the sample-to-detector distance. The microstructure of the initial hematite pellet is shown in Figure ",

Material modifications induced by X-ray irradiation are often considered as undesirable side effects in applications involving high brilliance sources such as 4 th generation synchrotrons. However, they can also be exploited for local tuning of electronic properties of materials such as superconducting Bi-2212  To verify this, we irradiated different portions of TiO2 and SrTiO3 samples at ID16B, with a \u224860x60 nm 2 beam at the energy of 17.5 keV, which is known to be able to modify this material from previous experiments performed in similar conditions. In particular, micrometric sized regions were irradiated both in the gap between the metal electrodes and far away from the electrodes. These relatively large regions were meant to be subsequently investigated by means of XANES at ID21. We were expecting a reduction of Ti 4+ to Ti 3+ as a consequence of the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which should result in a shift of the Ti K edge in the irradiated regions of the sample. Thereore, XANES maps were collected at ID21 to check differences in the edge position between irradiated and non-irradiated points, but no clear difference could be seen, as reported in Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The proposal aims atconducting operandoHERFD-XANES studies at Pd L edges for a Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2three-way catalyst for elucidating detailed mechanistic aspects of the concurrent CO and C3H6oxidation and NO reduction reactions by: (1) probing the interaction with the different reactant molecules under various gas atmospheres and temperature conditions, and (2) performing spatially resolved measurements along the cat-alyst bed. Noble metals play an important role in catalysis, with more than 50% going into emission control applications. Among different catalysts, the three way catalyst (TWC) is one of the most important emission control system to reduce the emissions of CO, hydrocarbons (HCs) and NOx of gasoline engine vehicles, when operated at conditions close to stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios (14.7:1, \uf020\uf06c = 1). Stricter regulations and the limited resources of the noble metals require an improvement of the efficiency of such systems, which can only be done by detailed understanding of the noble metal functionality and behaviour during catalyst lifetime. In this context, our study aimed at conducting operando HERFD-XANES studies at Pd L3 edges for Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 and Pd\/Al2O3 three-way catalysts (TWC) for elucidating detailed mechanistic aspects of the concurrent CO and C3H6 oxidation and NO reduction reactions. For this purpose, a series of reference samples containing Pd in different oxidation states and coordination geometries were investigated alongside with Pd TWCs under In situ cell a) b) Pantograp h Crystal analysers Incoming beam slits sample tower simplified reaction conditions. As shown in Figure  Preliminary analysis of the obtained data confirmed the high sensitivity of such measurements and revealed pronounced variations in the HERFD-XANES spectra collected at Pd L3 edges for the different reference materials (Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal establishes an industrially relevant methodology for operando characterization of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions under harsh conditions in gas and liquid phases currently unavailable for regular users. The scientific cases will be based on two classes of novel catalytic systems: Ru-mediated defunctionalization of polyols to olefins and alkenylation of arenes via direct C-H activation over single-site Pd-catalysts. Initially, a spectral database of well-defined Pd and Ru compounds will be collected and used as a training set for machine learning. Then, we will step by step increase the complexity of experimental conditions from currently available cells to a reactor that can withstand up to 250\u00b0C and 50 bar, with the possibility to sample the gas phase and carefully dose liquid reactants. Finally, the ML-based system will be implemented and tested allowing for online evaluation of structural and catalytic data and automated refining of the reaction conditions. ligand surrounding of ruthenium and Ru-ligand distances was developed based on the obtained results In situ experiment on homogenous-heterogenous palladium-zeolite based catalysts in the liquid phase was performed and analysed In situ experiment on homogenous-heterogenous copper-MOF catalysts in the liquid phase was performed and analysed A series of ex situ\/in situ studies on various palladium, ruthenium and rhodium-based catalysts of industrial importance were measured ana analysed 2022\/I BM23 18 shifts scheduled 20 \/II 20 \/I 20 \/II 2. Resources Provided by User team (financial, personnel, technical...): Financial resources. The online mass-spectrometer for in situ and operando experiments was purchased in the end of 2021 and will be installed at BM23\/ID24 beamlines in 2022.

The approach was implemented in PyFitIt code and will be soon released on a github in the new version of the code. External programmer, Denis Ryabov (Rostov-on-Don), was involved in the development of a webbased portal for X-ray spectral data. A design of the high-temperature and high-pressure operando cell for liquid catalytic systems, specifically ruthenium-based catalysts in ionic liquids under harsh conditions with the possibility for fluorescence detection of XANES was made. The cell will be produced and delivered to ESRF in March 2022. Year 1 According to the milestone 1, spectral databases of different well-defined palladium and ruthenium compounds were obtained experimentally and used as training sets for ML learning algorithms directly trained on these spectra and as test set for ML algorithms trained on the theoretical data which were calculated in frame of the scientific case of the project (more than 10,000 theoretical spectra). The web-based interface is being developed where any user will be able to identify the structure of the unknown compound (within the capacity of the database) in the online regime. According to the milestone 2, the developed ML methodology was applied identify the speciation of active sites in the series of palladium and ruthenium catalytic systems based on the ex situ and in situ XANES data, including the experiments performed for low concentrated catalysts, in liquid phase and in presence of gaseous and liquid substrate. These studies will be continued in 2022.",

    "title":"Quantifying Microscale Stress and Strain Fields in Concrete and Cementitious Composites",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We will quantify the microscale stress and strain fields generated during the macroscopic compression of concrete. Currently, the macroscopic modulus and strength of concrete are predicted accurately by \u201cmean-field\u201d micromechanics theories and numerical models based on the postulate that each sand particle (aggregate) in the microstructure experiences the same stress state during macroscale loading and is perfectly bonded to the surrounding cement-paste matrix. Recent work by the proposers demonstrates that the aggregates instead experience significant stress variability. Our proposed experiments will exploit combined 3DXRD, scanning 3DXRD and x-ray computed tomography, with digital volume correlation, to quantify stress variability and aggregate-matrix debonding during elastic and inelastic stages of compression in-situ. Results will improve micromechanics theories and provide first-of-its-kind information on aggregate-matrix interface mechanisms previously inaccessible in-situ. Obective -The aim of this experiment was to use a combination of in-situ x-ray tomography (XRT), 3D x-ray diffraction (3DXRD), and scanning 3DXRD (s3DXRD) at the ID11 beamline of the ESRF to study the microscale stress and strain fields generated during elastic and inelastic deformation of cement samples containing single-crystal sand. The goals of studying such microscale fields were to (1) examine stress variability within aggregates which would imply deviation from well-established Eshelby inclusion theories, (2) examine strain variability within cement paste surrounding aggregates to quantify stress\/strain concentrations which nucleate macroscopic sample failure, and (3) compare experimental measurements with mesoscale simulations for model validation and development of a robust virtual testing environment. The experiments build on progress by the applicants in employing and integrating XRT, 3DXRD, and s3DXRD measurements at the ESRF (ma3373, ma4200, ma4493)  Experiment Summary -Three experiments combining XRT, 3DXRD, and s3DXRD were successfully executed on distinct samples of cement containing single-crystal quartz aggregate. The quartz aggregate volume fraction varied in the three samples from 20 to 30%. The samples were compressed in strain increments in a custom load frame mounted on the rotation stage at ID11.

The kinetic laws of the martensitic transformation remain an open fundamental question due to the lack of experimental tools for inducing and tracking the process at the high-driving-force regime with sufficient time resolution.  The unique state-of-the-art CdTe Keck-PAD detector, allows us to fully utilize ESRF capabilities and break through current technological barriers of X-ray detection. The novel CdTe detector technology has superb quantum efficiency at energies over 40 keV and sub-microsecond time resolution, enabling a depth-resolved investigation of the phase transformation in typical high-quality NiTi wires of various diameters. Gradual increase of the X-ray energy allows for radially resolved detection by variation of penetration depth of austenite-martensite interfaces in the axisymmetric nano-crystalline material along different radii at different times.

V K-edge XAS experiments were performed to chemically characterise the interfacial phases formed on steel by novel vanadium (IV) lubricant additives, under friction conditions in a tribological contact. The chemical composition of the V phases, which are likely formed by complex mechanochemistry in the tribological contact, were followed as a function of high temperature, pressure, and shear. The in situ XANES results, complemented by previous ex and in situ XPS and NEXAFS studies, indicate the tribochemical formation of a composite mixed valence tribofilm, comprising of V(III), V(IV) and V(V), with notable variations between the bulk and surface of the tribofilm. Experiment Details. We used a custom-built tribometer (Fig.  Results. We analysed various vanadium containing compounds with varying oxidation states including VO(acac)2, VButylate and VOTris lubricant additives. Discernible differences were observed in the ex situ XANES spectra for the materials studied, most especially the features due to the 1s \u2192 3d and 1s \u2192 4p electronic transitions.  Conclusions and Future Work. Ultimately, the molecular-level mechanistic information obtained will enable the development of more effective and sustainable anti-wear additives. The results obtained from this experiment will inform future in situ\/operando XAS studies on the tribological properties of other vanadium and\/or molybdenum containing additives. Fig 2.

    "title":"Pores volume evolution and damage nucleation during hot rolling : investigation of opening mechanical fields by in situ X-ray nano-tomograph",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The aim of this experiment is to use the ID16B beamline to perform in situ X Ray nano-tomography during high temperature tensile test on a commercial 2050 aluminium alloy in order to characterize the damage evolution (pore nucleation and growth). The results extracted from the 3D volumes reconstructed will be used to have a better understanding of the phenomenon and feed current models to improve the hot-rolling process of thick aluminium plates.   This experiment has as a main objective to research the damage evolution in aerospace alloy Al 2050. Aluminium 2050 is an alloy widely used for aerospace internal structural components because its high properties combined with its particular low density. During the manufacturing process aluminum alloys undergo various thermomechanical steps, such as hot rolling. In particular, hot rolling enables to close the segregation pores that may form during casting. Exploring new process windows for this process may lead to extreme conditions where tensile states and large strain generate pore nucleation and pore growth. It is essential to learn how the pores evolve during similar conditions. The objective of this study is to mimic these extreme states by in situ tensile tests and track the porosity appearing during the deformation. The experiment took place in two sessions as during November 2021 there was a beam-loss that translated in losing at least two shifts, that were re-attributed in April 2022. The material scanned at ID16B was aerospace alloy aluminium 2050. The specimens scanned were small cylindrical samples of no more than 400 \u00b5m in diameter, especifically designed to meet the requirements of ID16B. The chemical composition of aluminium 2050 aerospace alloy is based on Al-Li-Cu. The experiment was performed at an energy of 17.4 keV with a high flux of 5.35x10^12 ph\/s. During this session at ID16B, in situ high-temperature (400-520 \u00b0C) interrupted tensile tests were performed on the specimens and imaged at each deformation step with two different resolutions: low resolution, 324nm\/pixel, and high resolution with 100 nm\/pixel. The two resolutions allow determining the global strain during the deformation steps and tracking the pore nucleation and growth. Each scan consists in 1003 projections and takes less than 40 seconds to complete. We successfully Figure  scanned 10 samples during the overall beamtime. This generated a vast database which contains thousands of pores nucleating and growing. The 3D volumes are already all reconstructed and segmented to distinguish the porosities and the intermetallic particles as shown in figure  During the shifts awarded for this experiment we performed multiple successful scans. This was possible because of the experimental setup was highly reproducible. The experiments were the main part of communication presentations at multiple conferences: Oral Presentations at: ICTMS 2022 (Grenoble, France), ICAA18 (Toyama, Japan) and ESRF's USER MEETING 2022. These experiments are also the central experimental work for the project InnovaXN XN2019-ESRF04 and will be published in the manuscript of Anthony Harrup's PhD thesis and in papers published in peer-reviewed journals.",

    "title":"Time resolved SAXS for controlled mineralization protocols of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate in presence of fetuin-A",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Biomineralisation is a process by which all living organisms produce mineralized tissues tailored to perform specific functions. Biomineralisation follows a complex and a multistep nucleation pathway understanding of which necessitates understanding the earliest nucleation events and subsequent growth from various possible precursor phases (amorphous or crystalline) to the final mineral phases. Although studied in detail for several decades, the understanding of nucleation and the subsequent growth process is weak, which we attribute to the fact that visualization of this process remains difficult. The experiment proposed here focusses on the time-resolved SAXS measurement to study mineralization of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate using mineralization protocols well optimized by the involved team. It is expected that the experiment will provide insights into the earliest stages of nucleation of the identified systems with \/ without the presence of glycoprotein Fetuin-A . Time resolved small angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) experiments were carried out to study the reaction kinetics on early stages of crystallization which can give insights on early onsets of nucleation. The proposed experiments focussed on the time-resolved SAXS measurement to study formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in presence of different additives such as salts, proteins and polyelectrolytes. It is expected that the experiment will provide insights into the earliest stages of nucleation of CaCO3, and information regarding mineralisation protocols with time resolution of milliseconds will be obtained. It was also proposed to study calcium phosphate formation mechanism, but we prioritised investigating CaCO3 formation as it linked directly to an upcoming beamtime at ID10 (MA-5103) where we studied the different morphologies and crystal forms of CaCO3 arising due to the presence of these additives. During the experiment we performed TR-SAXS measurements for a series of concentrations ranging from 2mM up to 36mM of precursors to precipitate calcium carbonate in presence of several additives for example fetuin-A, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), sodium chloride (NaCl) and poly aspartic acid (PAA) at temperatures of 25, 35 and 45 o C. Two different data-collection procedures were employed: 1. Precipitation in cell flow system: Pumps a bulk solution of reacting precursors through a tube in front of beam to perform measurements. 2. Precipitation in stopped flow system: Pumps separate precursors into a mixing chamber in microliter quantities that react while passing through the beam. Cell flow datasets were analysed to study structural evolution of CaCO3 for 3 different concentrations. In presence of PSS formation of bigger particles was observed on decreasing concentrations of PSS. Hurd-Flower model fitting was performed to trace the size evolution of particles, which also led to discovery of more than one sized population in the solutions which is also reported in literature. Results were published in J. Appl. Cryst. 56, 2023, 1114-1124. Abstract of the publication is given below along with some representative results. \"The formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) as an additive was examined by time resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in a flow system that mimics experimental conditions used at home facilities where the precipitation can be achieved in a beaker. The experiments were carried out at low concentrations to remain in the dilute regime. A model-independent analysis was performed using the Porod invariant which defines the scale factor, leaving only the distribution of radii as the adjustable parameter. The presence of the PSS additive strongly retards the precipitation of CaCO3 NPs. The formation of NPs reaches a state of equilibrium after a few minutes. Here, it is shown that the concentration of precursors at a fixed PSS concentration plays a key role in determining the size of the NPs obtained. A full analysis of the SAXS patterns was carried out using the Hurd-Flower model to account for the weaker intensity decay than the classical Porod behaviour. The temporal evolution of the particle radii was determined. Wideangle X-ray scattering experiments carried out simultaneously show that the particles formed have the structure of vaterite with growth consistent with the evolution of the Porod invariant.\" ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":" 3D Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) in combination with tandem Bragg diffraction to study mineralisation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) using known mineralisation protocols. The study will provide new understanding of how nano-sized grains are packed in 3D in CaCO3 particles thus unravelling the growth mechanism. Key questions are to understand transition from a flat hexagonal particle to a nested one and finally to spheroidal shapes with possibly spiky particles. The proposed experiment will lay the foundation for the development of new methodologies for real time imaging of mineralisation via the use of liquid phase CXDI and initiating research for the development of dynamic CXDI. 3D Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) in combination with tandem wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to study mineralisation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) under the presence of difference additives. The experiments were in continuance of an earlier beamtime at ID02 (MA5094) in order to systematically study the entire crystallisation process of CaCO3 -from early-stage nucleation events leading to growth of crystals into a fully grown microparticles. The central goal of the proposal was to understand how nano-sized grains are packed in 3D in CaCO3 particles thus unravelling the growth mechanism. Key questions are to understand transition from a flat hexagonal particle to a nested one and finally to spheroidal shapes with possibly spiky particles. The upgrade of the CXDI detector to Eiger-4M at ID10C during 2021 allowed us to use 2D Pilatus detector as a WAXD detector instead of Mythen-1D detector. This detector now facilitated not only the studies on crystal structures of the sample particles but also the preferred orientation of the crystal planes within the particles. A total of 28 CXDI measurements were made as a function of three different additives NaCl (a regular table salt), Polystyrene Sulfonate (PSS) and Fetuin-A, using an 8.04 keV monochromatic beam of dimensions 10x10\u00b5m. Particles to image were mounted on sample stage on a Si3N4 membrane of 100nm thickness with the width and height of 3mm with sturdy frame spanning 10mm high and across. The far field specked diffraction pattern was collected on the Eiger-4M detector while WAXD data was captured on the 2D Pilatus detector. The precipitations experiments were done at the ESRF based on the same experimental protocols for MA-4673 and MA-5094. Among several CXDI experiments done during the beamtime, two representative examples are shown in Figures  1.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The study is a continuation of our investigations on understanding mechanistic details of three-way catalysts by exploring the L edges of the noble metal components (previous proposal MA-4916 on Pd L edges). Hence, the aim of the present proposal it to conduct operando HERFD-XANES studies at Rh L edges for a Rh\/CeO2-ZrO2 three-way catalyst for elucidating: (1) the interaction of CO, C3H6 and NO with the noble metal under reaction conditions, and (2) performing spatially resolved measurements along the catalyst bed at selected temperatures during light-off \/light-out. Because it is essential to promote the reduction of hydrocarbons (HCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the air, stricter regulations are progressively implemented  A rational development of these materials implies the identification of active species and understanding the reaction mechanism as crucial steps. For this purpose, the study of the interplay between the noble metal, the support, and pollutant gases is highly important. During our beamtime MA5119 at the ID26 beamline of ESRF, high-energy-resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) was used to study the Pd L3 edge in a Pd\/\u03b3Al2O3 TWC during exposure to realistic gas compositions (CO, NO and C3H6 presence). The new gas-dosing infrastructure available at ID26 allowed a successful completion of our study. An in-situ cell designed by ESRF was used to accommodate the catalyst sample in the tender X-ray emission spectrometer chamber  In general, the high sensitivity of Pd L3 edge during catalyst interaction with various reagents was confirmed. Clear variations in the HERFD-XANES spectra profile were observed upon changes in the gas mixture. For instance, a pronounced decrease in the white-line intensity occurred already at room temperature when switching the gas mixture from O2\/He to CO+O2\/He (stoichiometric mixture -TWC) gas mixture, indicating the reduction of the noble metal (Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We aim to map the strain around spin CMOS compatible spin qubits at cryogenic temperature by Scanning Xray Diffraction Microscopy (SXDM). The qubits are housed in an epitaxial Si\/SiGe quantum well with lithograpically fabricated TiN electrodes on top. Spin qubits qubits are operated at temperatures T close to 0 K, while the local strains in the device will vary with T due to the different coefficients of thermal expansions of TiN compared to Si and SiGe. Strain fluctuations are expected to cause variations in the local electromagnetic potential in the QW, which will strongly influence the qubit performance. Thus SXDM measurements at low T, which are performed on a sample in a He-flow cryostat are necessary to determine the strain distribution during qubit operation. We will compare the experimental results with Finite Element (FEM) simulations based on an edge-force model, which will provide valuable insight for designing large qubit arrays with uniform properties.  The aim of this proposal was to characterize the local strain fluctuations underneath devices for coherent shuttling of electrons (\"QuBus\", Fig.  To map the strain distribution around the QuBus within the 10 nm thin strained Si quantum well (QW), a spatially resolved, non-destructive technique with high lattice sensitivity is needed. Thus, in-situ nano-beam scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) at ID01, is the technique of choice for this research.  For the measurements at LT, the sample was placed in a liquid He flow cryostat and the temperature was kept stable at 4 K.

It is known that this ductility arises because of martensitic transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) but the microscopic mechanisms at the origin of the onset of the transformation and the influence of different factors such as stress magnitude, crystal orientation are still unknown. In this experiment we want to spatially-resolve strain, crystal orientation and phase, and dislocation nature using micro-Laue diffraction on CSTZ micropillars which have been compressed at different levels of plastic strain. The results of such an experiment will be very valuable for the understanding of TRIP in CSTZ. In this experiment, we aimed to mill single-crystal pillars, where three main orientations with low indexes were selected for the in situ compression tests. These orientations of the MPs are according to Tab. 1: Table 1 -Miller indices orientations indexed by electron backscattered diffraction, of micropillars composed of 12 mol.% Ce-doped zirconia. [110] C2 [100] C3 [001] C4 [100] C5 [001] C6 [110] Ex situ Laue microdiffraction maps were acquired for each pillar with a stp size of 0.3 \u00b5m corresponding to the X-ray probe size.

However, when subjected to very high stress, it is reported that this alloy can suffer from embrittlement by a Stress Assisted Grain Boundary Oxidation (SAGBO) mechanism at high temperature. In this proposal we will focus on the kinetics of the rate limiting crack coalescence stage of this damage mechanism and study its sensitivity to microstructural parameters such grain size, texture and precipitation state of the material. For this end, we will perform time-lapse observations of crack coalescence under load at 650 C, using phase contrast tomography. The initial and final 3D grain structure of the samples will be characterized by DCT. Digital volume correlation will be used to quantify the deformation of the material and results will be compared to crystal plasticity and phase-field simulations on the digital twin of the sample volume. observation of the crack networks formed during a pilot test of accelerated stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests under autoclave conditions at Framatome;  The samples submitted to the accelerated SCC tests are loaded in a three-point bending configuration. The shape of the sample is rectangular, with approximate dimensions of 0.27 x 5.0 x 18.0 mm. The area subjected to higher tensile loads was cut to allow transmission over a range of 360 o to perform Phase Contrast Tomography (PCT) measurements. The main conclusion from this pilot test was to change the sample dimensions from a rectangle (30 x 4mm) to an elongated dog-bone shape with 0.27 x 1mm cross section) that is still compliant with the autoclave machines, but also compatible with PCT and DCT characterization at 60 keV. Different propagation distances were also evaluated to allow better capturing the cracks without introducing too many streak artifacts in the reconstructions. As these samples were plastically deformed, DCT reconstructions were not successful in this case. The samples were initially vertically aligned when already mounted inside the Nanox load frame at the 3DXRD endstation of ID11. A series of 5 slightly overlapping DCT sub-volumes were acquired in order to ensure coverage of the entire gage section of the sample. A reference PCT scan was acquired to serve as a standard for the quality of the reconstruction performed during the high temperature tests. The experimental setup for the in-situ SAGBO tests is depicted in the Figures  For this part of the experiment different groups of samples, with varying grain sizes, were grain mapped by DCT. The central part of the samples has been mapped by 7 overlapping DCT scans. Quick reconstructions were performed for the central volume of each sample to confirm data quality and feasibility of grain reconstruction for the different microstructural conditions. The samples were sent to the industrial partner (Framatome) where they are submitted to accelerated SCC tests. Once they are returned to the ESRF they will be scanned again in a similar way to what was shown in the first section of this report and the DCT sub-volumes containing the relevant (damaged) parts of material will be further analysed.

    "title":"Unveiling new boron-based 2D nanomaterials by synthesis in molten salts",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims at discovering new bi-dimensional materials made of transition metals and boron: MBenes. Although these solid-state phases are expected to exhibit important optoelectronic and catalytic properties, their synthesis could be achieve up to now only at a very small scale and with a large amount of crystal defects, which hinder the study of their properties. To reach some of these materials for the first time, especially a bidimensional iron boride, we want to explore an unreported synthesis pathway: the exfoliation of lamellar compounds MAB (A=metalloid) into inorganic liquids: molten salts. To achieve this goal, we need to understand the reactivity and the transformations of metal borides into molten salts, which are mostly a black box for chemical synthesis. We will shed light on the evolution of these layered materials into molten salts by performing in situ time resolved X-ray diffraction and scattering (PDF analysis). MBenes, or boridenes, are new 2D materials made of transition metals and boron, which attract huge interest for their expected electronic and catalytic properties.  This experiment aimed at unveiling the mechanism and chemical conditions under which a selected MAB phase could be synthesized and delaminated: Fe2AlB2. Based on our previous experience and on recent literature reports, we proposed the hypothesis that both procedures (synthesis and delamination) could occur by assistance of a molten salt media. Therefore, we performed in situ time resolved X-ray diffraction to identify the adequate experimental parameters of synthesis and understand the evolution of layered materials into molten salts. This proposal had two aims: (1) Identifying the ideal conditions of synthesis and exfoliation for a specific MAB phase: Fe2AlB2, which would yield an unreported 2D iron boride of large interest for electrocatalysis of hydrogen production from water and for ion batteries.  For the experiment we employed a sample environment setup designed and developed within our group, that is, a capillary vertical oven. This oven has been designed to mimick lab syntheses, including handling of liquid media in an open vessel while flushing inert atmosphere in this vessel (capillary). The first shift of the experiment was dedicated to setting up the oven on the beamline (Figure  After adjusting the analysis and detection conditions, the remaining shifts were dedicated to the analysis of reactions in molten salts. All of the experiments were performed at 10 \u00b0C\u2022min -1 heating rate, which was identified as suitable to ensure crystallization to take place in the systems of interest in the lab. The capillaries were scanned continuously and diffractograms were acquired for 1 s at 10 vertical positions of the capillaries. Hence, for each position, a diffractometer was assessed every ca. 30 s. The experiments were performed with a variable dwell time depending on the specific reaction, which will be detailed for each case. Fe2AlB2 can be synthesized from an elemental mixture (Fe + Al + B), but this usually requires long reaction times, temperatures and reproducibility is challenge. In contrast, its synthesis has also been realized from Al insertion into the FeB compound, which according to the literature renders much higher purity and reproducibility. The FeB compound however presents two structural modifications, a low temperature one that consists of an intergrowth of two structures (named \u03b1-FeB hereafter) and a high temperature modification (\u03b2-FeB), consisting of a classical periodic arrangement. The conditions of synthesis of Fe2AlB2 have not been explored, nor has the influence of the FeB polymorphism as starting material. We firstly assessed the mechanism of transformation of \u03b1-FeB to Fe2AlB2 upon reaction with NaAlCl4 and NaH as Al source and reducing agent, respectively. The diagrams are plotted against the reaction time as a heatmap in Figure  \u03b2-FeB was reacted following the same protocol as the one optimized for \u03b1-FeB, that is FeB:NaAlCl4:NaH = 2:3:10 with heating at 1000 \u00b0C for 1 h. The same in situ experiment starting from \u03b2-FeB (Figure  Classical delamination of Fe2AlB2 by aqueous acidic washing either completely dissolves Fe2AlB2, or does not show major structural changes. Alternative delamination paths were then explored. We proposed the use of the molten-salts delamination method published by M. Li  Following the guidelines offered by Y. Li with respect to the choice of the delaminating salt, Co 2+ , Fe 2+ , Cd 2+ , and Zn 2+ would provide sufficiently elevated electrochemical potentials to trigger Al oxidation. We explored all four of them, in the forms of eutectic mixtures with NaCl in order to lower their melting point: CoCl2 (from 798 to 359 \u00b0C), FeCl2 (from 671 to 372 \u00b0C), CdCl2 (from 564 to 325 \u00b0C) and ZnCl2 (from 313 to 249 \u00b0C). [7] The mixtures were prepared such that they yield the Fe2AlB2:MCl2 (M = divalent cation) ratio of 2:3 and these were heated only up to 600 \u00b0C in order to avoid the decomposition of Fe2AlB2. The results of the in situ scans are shown in Figure  Still, we observed an unexpected behavior. Beyond 400 \u00b0C, certain Bragg peaks from the Fe2AlB2 phase begin to shift to higher q values while the temperature is increasing, contrary to what would be expected from conventional thermal expansion. This denotes an anisotropic shrinkage. This result comes as surprising, since this is not in agreement with previous reports, which indicate that Fe2AlB2 is stable under argon up to at least 1200 \u00b0C  In situ XRD study of Fe2AlB2 along with the empirical temperature profiles and the refined lattice parameters from sequential Rietveld refinement. In each lattice parameter plot, the refined parameters are plotted as a scatter + line, and compared to the lattice parameters expected from thermal expansion in straight line. In light of the systematic observation of the lattice shrinkage, we decided to characterize more deeply this anomalous structural collapse. We followed the structural changes against temperature by performing sequential Rietveld refinements for all the diagrams. The results are plotted in Figure  The refined length of the a, b and c axis are plotted in comparison to the expected length according to the empirical linear anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients -\u03b1a = 8.1(1)\u202210 -6 K -1 , \u03b1b = 11.9(2)\u202210 -6 K - , \u03b1c = 10.7(3)\u202210 -6 K -1 -.  In parallel to the experiment depicted in Figure  To further question the nature of the structural change on Fe2AlB2, we performed an experiment up to 1000 \u00b0C to trigger full decomposition. Interestingly, above 900 \u00b0C a phase of stoichiometry Fe3Al2B2 begins to form, as shown in Figure  The in situ studies were performed thanks to the development of a synchrotron sample environment that permits to work in inert conditions. We studied the synthesis and delamination of Fe2AlB2 and derived compounds. The synthesis of this phase was achieved in molten salts by using \u03b1-FeB as starting material. Al could be inserted inside the \u03b1-FeB structure. Al formation as an intermediate product was confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction. The sequence of reactions was also shown to be identical for the \u03b1 and \u03b2-FeB polymorphs as starting materials. We then explored the exfoliation of Fe2AlB2 with molten salts. The salts did not prove major reactivity. However, Fe2AlB2 exhibited an abnormal lattice contraction with the temperature, which was associated to the formation of Fe\/B vacancies that ultimately lead to a transformation to the Fe3Al2B2 compound beyond 900 \u00b0C. This abnormal thermal behaviour has not been reported previously in the literature and can could only be identified thanks to the in situ monitoring of the reaction. Interestingly, the resulting defectuous compounds would hold a large content of vacancies, which may deeply impact catalytic properties, enable tailoring the physical properties of Fe2AlB2-based materials and possibly assist the exfoliation process. Further studies on this manner are ongoing. ",

    "title":"Structural analysis of electrolyte solutions confined in mesoporous silica",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The goal of this project is to characterize the silica nanocylinders filled with water and ions having various chaotropic and kosmotropic properties with total X-ray scattering coupled with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis as well as appropriate modelling. The results will give structural information such as the density profile within the pores and enabling a better fundamental understanding of the structural properties of water confined in the presence of ions in nanoconfinement. The results presented in this experimental report correspond to the experiments performed in april 2022 (MA5201). The goal of these experiments was to study the effect of cations, presenting various size and solubility, on the structural properties of water confined in nanoporous MCM-41. The samples were prepared by immersing the silica powder in 1M concentration solutions of LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl for 24 hours. In this report, we will present the main results obtained so far. Figures  We will proceed our investigations to study the structural properties of confined water by calculating the differential pair distribution function that has been calculated by subtracting the signal of the dry sample from the signal of the sample filled with an aqueous solution. This allows for the calculation of the PDF of the confined solution with the contribution of the liquid surface interaction. The obtained results are shown in figure  The data obtained for confined water in the presence of ions indicate that the water distortion follows the same order as in bulk solutions. The PDF obtained for LiCl and NaCl solutions exhibits correlation at the same distances as confined water, with a difference in peak intensities around the first neighbors. However, for the CsCl solution, a clear distortion of the water structure is observed. These findings suggest that both confinement and ion properties influence the water structure. The signals obtained from these experiments contain contributions from both water and ions. To investigate the interfacial water structure in the vicinity of the pore surface and separate these signals, we performed atomistic simulations. This study is part of a larger project that also aims to investigate the dynamics properties of water confined in MCM41 samples, in the presence of the same electrolyte solutions, i.e., LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl. To analyze the dynamics properties, quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements were conducted at the IN5 time-of-flight spectrometer at ILL. The obtained results, both structural and dynamics, will be correlated and discussed in a scientific paper that is currently being written.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Current interferometric gravitational wave detectors (VIRGO, LIGO) rely critically on the use of ultra\u2013stable Fabry\u2013Perot cavities. In these systems, a fundamental limit to the inherent performance is set by the thermal noise associated with the dielectric coatings of the cavity Bragg mirrors. Very frequently the mirrors in such applications consist of multilayers of a low refractive index material, such as amorphous SiO2, alternating with a high refractive index material, which is often amorphous Ta2O5. Unfortunately the local structure of a-Ta2O5 has not yet been fully characterised. There is a growing interest to study partially crystallized a-Ta2O5 (where nanocrystallites are formed) as a material with improved mechanical performances. Our aim is thus to investigate the thermal evolution of the local structure of a-Ta2O5 thin films by time\u2013resolved pair distribution function analysis and the crystallization kinetics as well. experiments are published in Ref.  The aim of the experiment was to study the local and medium range structure of amorphous a-Ta2O5 by means of a total scattering experiment with high energy X-rays. In particular, we aimed to investigate the evolution of the structure of a-Ta2O5 thin films submitted to a thermal treatment by time-resolved, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. At this scope, we probed the structural rearrangements occurring when a-Ta2O5 starts to crystallize, in order to identify the resulting polymorphic structure and determine the kinetics of the transformation process. The experiment was carried out at the ID11 Beamline of ESRF. Data were collected by orientating the amorphous a-Ta2O5 thin film (maximum 100-nm-thick) parallel to the X-ray beam (< 1mm along the longitudinal size; see Figs. ",

Unfortunately, the experiment was not so easy due to the small size of the sample and the difficulties in the alignment did not permit to perform all the measurements.

    "title":"Local atomic order and Mbar pressure-temperature phase diagram of BaZrO3 perovskite",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Information on the local scale and structural stability of cubic ABO3 perovskite still lacks systematic detailing.  BaZrO3 is a widely explored material for several applications due to its interesting properties. However, its structural stability under pressure still raises great doubts. This topic is considered a challenge, especially when related to the possible phase transition also at low temperature. The lack of detailed structural data along with the small amount of previous studies on the phase transitions of BaZrO3 makes this topic an interesting to be explored. Therefore, we propose here to study the phase transition under pressure Pm-3m to I4\/mcm in BaZrO3 perovskite and to probe its pressure-temperature phase diagram, considering runs at low temperature (10\u2012300K) and high-pressure (0\u20121Mbar). This will provide information on crystal structure stability of BaZrO3 perovskite. The main objective of this project was to probe the underlying mechanisms at short-range of the octahedral tilting-driven structural phase transition in BaZrO3 using EXAFS data. We performed XAS measurements following the temperature-pressure phase diagram of BaZrO3 perovskite in the 10-300 K and 0-1.2 Mbar ranges. We have asked for this project 6 fresh NPDs with beveled Boehler-Almax design and height 1.6 mm and cullet sizes of 150\/300 \u03bcm. At the ESRF, the proposal was accepted and 18 shifts of beamtime were granted in BM23. Three DACs equipped with NPDs were prepared, as follows: 1 LeToullec CuBe cell for low temperature with 150\/300 \u03bcm NPDs, 1 conventional LeToullec cell for room temperature with 150\/300 \u03bcm NPDs, and 1 LeToullec CuBe cell for low temperature with 200\/300 \u03bcm NPDs. The latter one was loaded with neon gas, while the formers ones were considered for solid loading. In fact, we requested an exchange of one 150\/300 \u03bcm pair for another 200\/300 \u03bcm pair available at the BM23\/ID24 stock. We conducted EXAFS measurements at Zr K-edge (17.998 keV) under isothermal compression at two different temperatures: 15 K and 295 K. In run1, one 150\/300 \u03bcm cell was solid loaded with BaZrO3 and compressed up to 120 GPa. In run 2, we compared the temperature effect on the local atomic structure barium zirconate under pressure. For this purpose, a CuBe cell with 150\/300 \u03bcm NPDs was solid loaded with BaZrO3 and the DAC placed inside a helium-flow cryostat at 15 K. Later, the cell was compressed up to 120 GPa maintaining a fixed temperature at 15 K. In run 3, we probed the effect of hydrostaticity on the local structure at 15 K. A third cell with 200\/300 \u03bcm was loaded with a BaZrO3 pellet (20\u00d720\u00d715 \u03bcm 3 ) and the neon as pressure transmitting medium. Both ruby and gold foil were employed as pressure gauge. We used a helium-flow cryostat for diamond anvil cells developed in collaboration with and at the HP-ESRF sample environment. The temperature was monitored from a Pt-thermocouple mounted near the DAC [see in Fig. ",

These nanometer-thick phases are complex to characterize by solution analysis and difficult to characterize since realistic flat surface at large scale is difficult to obtain after long term alteration by groundwater with UO2+x. The aim of this proposal is to use the direct proof of concept (Lu et al, submitted) to determine on absolute scale the reflectivity as well as the scattering produced by a dense packing of micron-sized grains. Thus, a combination of SAXS and WAXS will allow for the first time to in situ characterize the thickness of these neoformed phases using the reflectivity signal, the nanoporosity of the layer and the crystalline structure of these phases from the scattering signals at higher q on isolated grains.  In this experiment, 4 capillaries filled with 4 mg of U0.93Ce0.08O2 powder having grain sizes comprised between 500 nm and 3 \u00b5m will be prepared in glove box of our laboratory. Three of these capillaries will be filled in glove box with synthetic groundwater prepared as in  In this experiment, spherical particles of UO2 (instead of ThO2) were analyzed in order to determine their morphology and porous texture. These particles were prepared using wet chemistry routes aiming to precipitate directly morphology-controlled actinide oxides from mixtures of solutions. Such methods are mostly based on the hydrothermal decomposition of U(IV) carboxylate, followed by the hydrolysis of the cations which leads to the formation of amorphous U(OH)4 samples, finally aging to UO2.nH2O. In order to minimize the absorption effect, sample located in katpon capillary has been characterized using synchrotron SAXS on ID02 beamline at the ESRF (Grenoble, France). The operating beam energy was 16 keV with a beam size of 70\u00d790 \uf06dm 2 (vertical and horizontal, respectively). The sample to detector distances were 1.4 m, 6 m and 31 m. The scattering patterns were recorded using an Eiger 2 4M detector (Dectris).

    "title":"In situ studies of graphene CVD growth on Cu-Sn liquid alloy: Atomic structure, composition, and interactions at Gr\/Cu-Sn interface",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Liquid metal catalysts (LMCats) bear the prospect of continuous 2D materials (2DM) production with unprecedented structural quality, efficiency, and speed. We have previously succeeded in studying the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene on liquid copper at 1370 K (see the previous publications). Meanwhile, growing graphene on liquid catalysts at lower temperatures is of great technical and economic interest. One important candidate is tin, which has a relatively low melting point (505 K) and an exceptionally low vapor pressure. However, tin has very low catalytic activity for graphene growth. Hence, an alloy between tin and a more active metal can provide a compromise between a lower melting point and enough catalytic activity. This proposal aims to grow graphene on a liquid Cu-Sn alloy surface and study the interactions and the atomic structure of the Gr\/Cu-Sn interface using XRR, GIXD, and XRF. This is to be done using the dedicated liquid diffractometer at ID10. We performed an in-situ study of graphene growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on liquid metal alloys by XRR, GID, and X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The energy of the X-ray beam was set to 22 keV. The goal of the DirectSepa project was to find a low-melting temperature metal catalyst as a replacement for high-melting temperature copper while maintaining the decent catalytic activity and the quality of the growth graphene in order to facilitate the development of technologies for the transfer of graphene directly from the liquid substrate to a solid one. Therefore, we tested the growth on three different alloy systems: Cu mixed with Sn, In, and Ga at different mass ratios. We recorded XRR and GIXD spectra on the clean liquid alloy surfaces before and after the graphene growth. We discovered that both Sn and In reveal relatively poor catalytic activity towards graphene: even with the smallest admixture of these metals (5 wt%), we could not achieve single-layer growth. On the contrary, the addition of Ga does not lead to a drastic change in the growth mechanism. By varying the growth temperature and the gas flows, we achieved single-layer growth up to 60 wt% of Ga. The corresponding XRR curves are shown in Figure  We used Refl1d software to fit the XRR curves. We applied a slab model containing three slabs: Cu, C, and a void in between. The void width directly corresponds to an important parameter -the interlayer graphenecopper gap ",

    "title":"The role of Pd and Rh in three-way catalysts (TWC) under realistic reaction conditions",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The study is a continuation of our investigations on understanding mechanistic details of three-way catalysts (TWC) by exploring for the first time the L edges of the noble metal components (proposal MA-4916 on Pd L edges) under in situ \/ operando conditions. With this proposal we aim at completing our operando HERFD-XANES study on Pd L edges for a Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 three-way catalyst under applied reaction conditions. In a similar manner, we would like to investigate Rh L edges for a Rh\/CeO2-ZrO2 TWC. The obtained results will help to: (1) uncover the interaction of CO, C3H6 and NO with the noble metals under reaction conditions, and (2) perform spatially resolved measurements along the catalyst bed at selected temperatures during LOff\/LOut for elucidating essential mechanistic aspects.  For the development of more stable and efficient catalysts, it is crucial to understand the interactions between the active sites of a catalyst and the support. Elucidating how the catalyst activation, deactivation, and regeneration processes occur under various gas atmospheres is as well essential. Particularly for catalysts containing a low concentration of active species, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has become a powerful tool for element specific studies under reaction conditions. Within XAS, High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD) -X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy in the tender x-ray range (1.5 -5 keV) stands out because it allows studying the electronic structure and the local geometry variation based on the L 3 -edges of 4d transition metals in the catalyst. HERFD -XANES provides background-free data with spectral broadening below the width given by the core-hole lifetime. For all spectroscopic methods, high time and spatial resolution are essential to reveal the evolution of the active catalyst state  During our MA-5358 beamtime at ID26 beamline, HERFD-XANES was used to study the Rh-L 3 edge in a catalyst based on Rh\/\u03b3Al 2 O 3 under simplified reaction conditions. Using the new cell designed by the ESRF (Sample environment) allowed us to perform spatially resolved in situ\/operando HERFD-XANES measurements. The information collected is relevant because it links the catalyst structure at different locations in the catalytic bed with surface reactivity. The in situ\/operando cell was placed inside the X-ray emission spectrometer chamber. The gas mixtures were dosed through mass flow controllers, while the reaction products were monitored with a mass spectrometer and an FTIR spectrometer. The collected HERFD-XANES spectra showed pronounced variations of the Rh-L 3 edge profile for the different reference materials (Figure ",

    "title":"Understanding lattice strain distributions within anisotropic FCC and HCP polycrystals \u2013 key for materials design and modelling",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The relationship between macroscopic and microscopic stresses is central for a quantitative understanding of the mechanical behaviour of structural materials. The goal of this proposal is the validation and improvement of micromechanical methods to estimate local stresses for anisotropic FCC and HCP polycrystalline materials. A particular focus lies on the Maximum-Entropy method (MEM) which is capable of predicting local stresses based on macroscopic mechanical properties and microstructural information. We propose to implement Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT) to determine the shape, arrangement, orientation and average elastic strain tensor of a representative ensemble of individual grains within a polycrystal for increasing tensile loading. Based on this unique experimental dataset, simulations and analytical methods can be combined to validate the MEM, yielding a new computationally extremely efficient approach for hierarchical materials informatics. The aim of these experiments was the validation of theoretical micromechanical methods to estimate local stresses for anisotropic BCC and HCP polycrystalline materials, in particular the Maximum-Entropy-Method (MEM)  Armco iron and 99,99% pure titanium have been selected for the experiments due to their lack of annealing twins  Annealing recipe Pressure Armco Iron 35h at 500\u00b0C + 2h at 750\u00b0C 10 -5 mbar 99,99% Titanium 35h at 500\u00b0C + 1.5h at 600\u00b0C 10 -5 mbar Table  Before the in situ experiments we performed tensile tests for each material and both sample designs to determine the yield strength (see Figure  Figures  A statistical relevant number of grains is required to validate the MEM. To achieve this, our goal was to investigate at least 1000 grains for each sample.

The grain positions and z-components of the average elastic strain tensor of each grain obtained with the FF scan from the EDM-machined iron sample from Figure  The FF data was used to obtain the inverse pole figures (IPF) for different sample axis as shown in Figure  Compared to the initial proposal we have changed two major experimental protocols: 1) Instead of using face centred cubic (FCC) we used bodycentred cubic (BCC) metals, specifically iron. This modification was motivated by the beamline crew, because of their negative experience with twinning in FCC metals, which currently can not be handled easily during data analysis. 2) Instead of using optical microscopy for tracking sample shape canges and feature tracking, we used PCT to track the position of amorphous SiO2 micorspheres applied to the sample surfaces . This enabled a 3D-reconstruction of the macroscopic sample strains with superior spatial resolution and easened our experimental setup (no implementation of an optical microscope in the experimental setup needed). Open question(s) and current work:From an experimental viewpoint we have succesfully conducted all experiments to achieve the primary goals of MA5414. Currently, data analysis and post mortem sample characterization in our home-lab at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is ongoing and could not be completed in the short interval between the experiment and the due date of this report (4 weeks). Already now, several new puzzling questions are identified based on MA5414 which will be part of a new proposal. Four weeks after the beamtime we are still performing an in-depth analysis of all the data and currently start the comparison with MEM approaches. However, already at this early stage, we can conclude: 1) Our sample manufacturing protocol, particularly the EDM-sample design, is well-suited for the intended aim. The sample quality allows for DCT and FF experiments with the required resolution. 2) The PCT on silica microspheres dispersed on the sample surface -with which we replaced the initially proposed optical inspection -proofed to be ideal to track the macroscpic strains in all directions in an accurate, fast and efficient way. 3) The number of grains obtained within one loading step (see right column in Tab. 2) allows for a validation of the MEM, even though this requires stacking of consecutive layers. Per load step we achieved the required number of at least 1000 grains for all samples. 4) The established experimental methodology yields all macroscopic and microscopic parameters which are necessary to accomplish the comparison of the experimental data with MEM appraoches. 5) The first implementation of the experimental data into the MEM framework yields three major observations: (i) Sample eigenstrains are much larger than expected for fully recrystallized and coarsegrained metals, (ii) an informed MEM considering the eigenstrains can predict the evolution of the overall strain distribution in the samples, however, (iii) even for 1000 grains, the variation of the local neighbourhood of individual grains with specific orientation is still low. 6) Based on these observations, we would suggest to investigate samples with different eigenstrain distribution produced by specific annealing conditions and to increase the number of illuminated grains to about 10000. The acquisition rate of DCT at ID11 allows for this increase in sample size and simulations show that this would be sufficient to investigate and incorporate neighbourhood effects. ",

Specifically this study will identify changes in porosity and microcracks formation occurring in specimens upon CO2 exposure; elucidate carbonation extent of low carbon cements, tracing changes in pore structure and formation of crystalline reaction products (e.g. carbonate polymorphs) when exposed to CO2; and will aid validating\/ refuting existing carbonation mechanisms proposed for low carbon cements. These unique outcomes will enable optimisation of cement formulations for increasing carbonation resistance. Experiment title: Understanding the interactions between CO 2 and novel cement materials via advanced XRD-CT Experiment number: MA5424 Beamline: Date of experiment: from: 19-09-2022 to: 24-09-2022 Date of report: 07.09.2023 Shifts: Local contact(s): Dr Partha Paul Dr Marco Di Michiel Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Susan Bernal Lopez, University of Leeds, UK (Main proposer) Prof. Phillip Withers, University of Manchester, UK *Prof. John L.

Phases indicated in the XRD patterns correspond to C-A-S-Hcalcium aluminium silicate hydrate; E-ettringite; Ht-CO2-layered double hydroxide (hydrotalcite); G-gypsum; V-vaterite. Figure  These experiments demonstrate the applicability of XRD-CT to understand complex degradation processes of cement materials upon CO2 exposure. The results derived from this study are providing unique and new insights into the role of secondary reaction products in the carbonation process of these cements. However, when conducting experiments in the previously allocated beamtime, it was not possible to collect data to elucidate how different calcium carbonate polymorphs and how such formation might be linked to the degradation of the main reaction products a calcium aluminosilicate type gel with a tobermorite structure. Since completing these experiments, the applicants have been working on developing strategies to overcome the issues encountered in the first experiments, preventing the collection of data at higher XRD 2-theta values, so that analysis of calcium carbonate polymorphs and degradatation of the main reaction product forming in cements can be conducted. Understanding the type and amount of calcium carbonate polymorphs forming as a function of carbonation of different Ca-bearing phases present in hardened alkali-activated cements, will provide a new understanding about the carbonation mechanism of these cements, and enabling determining the potential ability of carbonation reaction products to precipitate in the pore structure to compensate changes in porosity linked to carbonation. A phenomenon observed in conventional cements, but never evaluated for low carbon cements, such as the ones evaluated in this study.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The Li-mediated ammonia synthesis (LiMeAS) is currently the only proven way to synthesize ammonia electrochemically. However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood, with recent publications stating that the elusive solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer could be a very important factor. Similar to the battery literature, it is believed to prevent excess electrolyte decomposition and regulate the Li plating behavior. In the case of the LiMeAS the SEI layer may control the diffusion rate of the reactants, N2, H+ and Li+. In this proposal, we aim to fundamentally understand the SEI layer as well as the deposit of the electrode at different reaction conditions (electrolyte solvents, salts, current densities and pressures) and investigate how these changes influence the faradaic efficiency (FE). The expected results will help to further understand and improve the performance of the LiMeAs and bring us a step closer to a renewable ammonia production. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), formed as a consequence of Li plating during the Lithium mediated ammonia synthesis (LiMeAS) is often invoked to explain observed changes in stability and faradaic efficiency  When LiBF4 was used, LiF was already detected in the first measurements, indicating thermal decomposition of the electrolyte salt.

    "title":"Systematic operando XAS studies of Pd\/Al2O3 and Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 three-way catalysts",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The study aims at understanding mechanistic details of three-way catalysts (TWC) by exploring the struc-ture of Pd species in Pd\/Al2O3 and Pd\/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts during systematic variation of reaction atmos-phere, from simplified to realistic gas mixtures. The operando investigations of Pd K edge will be com-plementary to those conducted in our previous HERFD-XANES experiments at ID26 on Pd L3 edge (pro-posal MA-4916), and will contribute to a holistic comprehension of TWC functionality. In short, we will focus on: (1) identification of inhibition\/boosting phenomena by operando monitoring the evolution in Pd oxidation state during interaction with CO, C3H6 and NO and their combinations, and (2) revealing the impact of catalyst support and reaction mixture on noble metal sintering and redispersion. Noble metals play a crucial role in numerous catalytic reactions including emission control. To eliminate harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from gasoline-powered vehicles the so-called three-way catalysts (TWC) containing Pd, Rh and Pt have been used since decades  In this context, our study focuses on elucidating changes in the electronic structure of Pd and Rh during the simultaneous NO reduction and CO\/C3H6 oxidation on Pd\/Al2O3 and Rh\/Al2O3 catalysts. The sieved catalyst powders (125-250 \uf06dm) were placed in quartz capillary reactors (OD = 1.5 mm), which were heated by a commercial gas blower (Oxford). The gas mixture containing low concentrations of CO, C3H6 and NO was dosed via mass flow controllers. The reaction products were monitored with MS and FTIR spectroscopy instruments. Initially, a series of Pd and Rh reference samples with different oxidation states and coordination geometries were investigated. Then, the focus was on observing the behaviour of the two catalysts under simplified to more complex reaction conditions in operando mode. Preliminary analysis of the XAS data collected at the middle position of Rh\/Al2O3 catalyst bed during exposure to a stoichiometric CO\/O2\/He mixture indicates a slight reduction of Rh species with increasing the temperature and progress of CO conversion. The Rh K edge XANES spectra measured under reaction conditions at RT and 200\u00b0C are shown in Fig.  Adding to the complementary data collected at Rh and Pd L3 edges (ID26), the obtained information is valuable for understanding the impact of individual reagents and their combinations on the catalyst structure, such as CO+O2, CO+NO+O2, CO+NO+C3H6+O2, and CO+NO+C3H6+H2O+O2. Altogether, these findings will serve as a rational basis for developing more efficient catalysts and advanced microkinetic models that account for the structural changes of the active noble metal under reaction conditions. The collected data will be analyzed in a systematic way to publish detailed information about reagents interactions with three-way catalysts.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Silver sulphide (Ag2S) quantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystal with outstanding optical properties as a broad absorption spectrum and narrow and tuneable emission in the Near-Infrared domain. Ag2S is a non-toxic material, which makes these QD eligible for in vivo imaging and drug delivery. However, their stability in biological systems and their biocompatibility need to be assessed before any in vivo application. We are currently developing Ag2S QDs with different sizes and coatings, in order to optimize their optical properties. We propose to make use of XAFS to investigate the stability of these different formulations in cellular models, including in 3D cell cultures mimicking the liver. This information, corroborated by their photophysical characterization and by cytotoxicity assays, will help us identify the best candidates for the development of nanoplatforms for imaging and therapy.  Additionally, we prepared the complexes formed by silver with GSH (ratio 1\/1 and 1\/2) and with DPen (1\/1) at pH 9, corresponding to an intermediate step of the heat up synthesis approach used for the QD. As reference samples we used a previously characterized Ag(I)-GSH complex (5 mM) in solution at pH 7,  We used custom, screw-less sample holders produced with a 3D printer at the ESRF, sealed with kapton foils on both sides. 100 \u03bcl drops of solutions were deposited in the sample holders and immediately frozen in LN2 in our home laboratory. The samples were transferred to the ESRF in LN2, then mounted in the He cryostat of BM23 for XAS measurements. We measured Ag K-edge absorption spectra by scanning the edge region between 25.30 keV and 26.49 keV (k = 16 \u00c5 -1 ) with the Si(311) monochromator, with constant steps in k in the exafs region. The scans were run in the step-by-step mode. The slits were opened to provide a beam size at sample of \u223c3 \u00d7 1 mm 2 and minimize the photon density, in order to avoid radiation damage. All solutions were measured in the fluorescence mode, with a Vortex SDD detector. The Ag2S reference powder was prepared as a pellet diluted in BN and measured in transmission. 3 to 14 scans per sample were acquired and merged, depending on the Ag concentration. We could acquire high-quality data for all conditions. The data reduction was performed with standard methods using the Athena software. The extracted EXAFS spectra were Fourier-Transformed in the k range [2.3, 12.3] \u00c5 -1 , then fitted in the real space in the R range [1, 3.2] \u00c5, with the XAS viewer GUI implemented in Larch.

The evidence for microcrack formation during the cooling process is illustrated in Figure  The simultaneous evolution of the amount of tetragonal zirconia is roughly evaluated by the evolution of the ratio of the (111)t and (111)m integrated diffracted intensities. We have plotted the evolution of both the appearance of the additional SAXS signal and the zirconia t\u2192m SPT in Figure  Zirconia specimen #1 had already seen, prior this experiment, a heating up to 1300\u00b0C. It was therefore assumed that this specimen contained an already quite dense nanocrack network. On this specimen, we did only one thermal cycle, i.e. heating up to 1350 \u00b0C and cooling. Zirconia specimen #2 was a fresh one. On this specimen, we did 4 thermal cycles loading and we clearly observed variation of the SAXS signal during each cycle and between them. We spent the last day for preliminary investigation of an aluminium titanate specimen, which is another oxide for which the thermal dilation is extremely anisotropic at the crystal scale. Besides few minor problems with the furnace control, the experiment worked well. The D2AM beamline is very well-adapted to such SAXS -WAXS combined in situ high temperature measurements. Fig. 3. Coupling of the increase of the SAXS signal and the zirconia t\u2192m SPT during cooling. (a) Increase of the SAXS signal during the cooling process. The starting point at 1350 \u00b0C corresponds to the blue curve.

    "title":"Structural anisotropy characterization of fiber-reinforced hydrogels scaffolds during extrusion-based 3D printing for soft tissue repair.",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Engineered biomimicking soft tissues have been greatly improved by the use of extrusion-based 3D bioprinting techniques. They are classically made of fiberreinforced hydrogels with designed rheological behavior in order to give mechanical strength and structural support for the cell development. However, the mechanical properties of the extruded material which are influenced by the relationship between the hydrogel rheological behavior and the printing conditions remain unpredictable. Our team has developed a numerical approach to model the orientation of the matrix polymer chains and nanofibrils during extrusion-based 3D printing. To validate the model, the polymer and nanofibril flow-induced anisotropic orientation of the extruded material at the output of the nozzle are needed. -Objective & expected results: -Bioprinting is the process where a tissue engineering construct is manufactured by bioink deposition. One possible bioprinting process is the controlled microextrusion from a cartridge through a nozzle of a hydrogel precursor solution, encapsulating cells or other biological bodies as displayed in Fig.  -Results and conclusions of the study: -Fig.  Our observations have demonstrated that (i) the anisotropy i.e. hydrogel constituent's orientation can be observed in situ through SAXS and WAXS measurements, and (ii) is influenced by the printing conditions, offering the perspective to manufacture anisotropic cellularized tissue engineering constructs with the use of 3D bioprinting. However, such orientation is only significant in the outer part of the extrudate where the highest shearing of the viscous ink is occurring, since at the center of the sample, the hydrogel is evidenced to be mainly isotropic. High shear conditions and a better control of the gelation point seem to be necessary to propagate orientation in the center of extrudates. -Justification and comments about the use of beam time: -The analysis of the effect of printing parameters on the orientation of 3D printed extrudates in situ during extrusion was made possible by combining SAXS and WAXS (With WOS detector). The results will be submitted for publications.",

To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first in situ \/ operando study on Pd-based methane oxidation catalysts exploring the tender X-ray energy range. To meet tightening environmental legislation and to achieve efficient environmental protection, alternatives to conventional diesel or gasoline engines must be found. Engines powered by natural gas\/biomethane (or by power-to-X-processes) seem to be a promising solution, as their high fuel efficiency and low pollutant emissions stand out. However, the small amounts of the strong greenhouse gas CH4 that are emitted must be catalytically removed. Pd-based catalysts are presently considered the most efficient systems for total oxidation of methane  Our study aimed at conducting tender X-ray HERFD-XANES measurements to uncover the interactions of CH4 and H2O with Pd species that lead to the fast inhibition and long-term H2O-deactivation behaviour of Pd\/\uf067-Al2O3 methane oxidation catalysts. Firstly, a series of Pd reference samples with different oxidation states and coordination geometries were investigated as pellets. For the operando measurements a newly developed cell of ESRF with plug-flow geometry was used. The catalyst samples were used as sieved powders (125-250 \uf06dm), and were exposed to different gas mixtures containing low concentrations of CH4, NO, O2 and H2O vapours. The reaction products were monitored with MS and FTIR spectroscopy instruments. Preliminary evaluation of the data collected for Pd referenecs indicate a high sensitivity of the L3 edge to the noble metal oxidation state and ligand type. In the as prepared Pd\/\uf067-Al2O3 catalyst, Pd was found in oxidized (Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to employ Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy to acquire microscopic maps of the lattice deformations in dislocation-free SiGe layers grown by lateral selective epitaxy on a Silicon-on-insulator substrate. These samples utilize an aspect-ratio dislocation trapping mechanism and are to serve as near-perfect SiGe virtual substrates, which are required for the housing of sensitive quantum devices such as spin qubits. The main goals are to map the spatially-dependent tensors of lattice strain and rotation as well as any gradients in the SiGe alloy composition. This data would provide insight into the mechanisms of lateral epitaxy and the associated anisotropic plastic relaxation, allowing better control of the complicated deposition procedure and the fabrication of larger dislocation-free regions. The results will help provide a path towards the up-scaling of quantum devices as well as the development of mechanical modells for the description of laterally grown thin films.  The aim of the proposal was to characterize the lattice strain \u03b5, lattice rotation w and alloy composition x in Si1-xGex layers grown by lateral epitaxy, shown schematically in Fig.  We expect that both local gradients of the Ge content x and anisotropic plastic relaxation may induce local deformations of the Si1-xGex lattice. A suitable characterization requires a technique combining small spatial resolution with high sensitivity to the crystal lattice, which is enabled by Scanning Diffraction Microscopy (SXDM) at ID01.  From the SXDM datasets, we expect to determine the full lattice strain tensor and rotation tensors for both samples, leveraging an analysis procedure relying on the linear combination of spatial mappings for three asymmetric Bragg reflections.

Thus, this proposal envisages the use of scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy (SXDM) to obtain information about the structural lattice distortions present in QD-devices of different Sb contents. We also intend to record spatially resolved lattice features around the QD- areas by SXDM using an in-operando approach (bias voltage) at the ID01 beamline.

    "title":"Advancing grain growth models for transparent alumina ceramics",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Understanding grain growth as a function of grain boundary energy through simulations informed by in-situ measurements is the motivation for this proposal. We will measure grain boundary velocity as a function of grain boundary character using scanning 3D X-ray diffraction (scanning 3DXRD) during in-situ sintering of undoped alumina. 3DXRD is necessary to spatially resolve the crystallographic orientations across the sample (to measure grain boundary character and positions as a function of time). Because the grains will be small (1\u221210 \u03bcm, slightly larger than is typically desirable for resolvability), we require scanning 3DXRD, which has a higher spatial resolution than conventional 3DXRD dictated by the beam cross-section (150\u2212200 nm^2). The results will be integrated into a computational methodology using a Cauchy-Crofton\/graph-based approach, and, more generally, develop a modern predictive understanding of grain growth that takes grain boundary energies into consideration. Motivation: The goal of the experiment is to measure grain boundary velocity as a function of grain boundary character using scanning 3D X-ray diffraction (scanning 3DXRD) during in-situ sintering of alumina. There is a significant need for high quality anisotropic transparent ceramics such as alumina for next generation laser-host materials. To achieve transparent anisotropic alumina polycrystals, abnormal grain growth should be prevented during the sintering step to restrict the grain size below 1 \u03bcm. Grain growth is dictated by the growth rates of grain boundaries, which can vary due to anisotropy in surface energies. Understanding grain growth during the last stage of sintering as a function of anisotropic grain boundary energy through simulations informed by in-situ measurements is the motivation for this proposal. Because of the relatively small grain size (5-20 \u03bcm), scanning 3DXRD is indispensable, with spatial resolutions dictated by the beam cross-section (150-200 nm\u00b2)  Experiment Overview: In this experiment, commercial alumina powder with>99.99% purity with average particle sizes of 300 nm was used to fabricate the bulk Al2O3 ceramic sample. The alumina powder was characterized at Michigan Center for Materials Characterization. Then, fully recrystallized anisotropic alumina samples were prepared and machined using FIB and transported to ID11 at the ESRF. In-situ phase contrast transmission (PCT), X-ray diffraction tomography (DCT), and scanning 3DXRD were performed on ID11. By combining the different modalities, we were able to characterize the microstructure evolution during grain growth on different length scales, from the subgrain orientation of individual grains (using scanning 3DXRD) to the aggregate behavior of several thousands of grains (using PCT and DCT). Results: Preliminary results are shown in Fig.  Fig.  Fig.  Current and Future Plans: The results presented above are preliminary. Currently, we are analyzing the PCT and scanning 3DXRD data, as well as the DCT data, culminating in the ability to investigate the microstructural evolution of the bulk samples at different heating temperatures across multiple length scales. The PCT data will yield information about the 3D porosity distribution and pore evolution within the bulk sample. The DCT data will provide a 3D view of all the grains in the bulk sample, which can be used to validate the scanning 3DXRD measurements (Note: Some grain information may be missing due to the small grain size in the initial microstructure). The scanning 3DXRD data will be employed to reconstruct the 3D grain morphology by stacking the 2D layers together. Thanks to its high spatial resolution (250 nm in this experiment), the scanning 3DXRD data can also offer subgrain-level orientation and local grain boundary details for each grain throughout the heat treatment process. Lastly, we will develop a new 3D grain topology processing pipeline to automatically measure grain boundary curvature and detect grain triple points, as well as quadruple points for bulk sample. Finally, future work will involve the integration of 2D layer information into 3D data, enabling us to track individual grain boundary positions, local orientation evolution, and the measurement of grain boundary character in 3D as a function of time. The results will be used to inform a novel computational methodology of grain growth using a Cauchy-Crofton\/graph-based approach, and, more generally, develop a modern, predictive understanding of grain growth that takes into consideration the anisotropic energies of different grain boundaries. Building upon the technique developed during this PCT+ scanning 3DXRD+DCT experiment at ID11 on anisotropic Alumina, our goal is to apply this approach to the investigation of other ceramic materials in a future beamtime proposal.

    "title":"Optimising electrical poling processes for single crystal relaxor ferroelectrics",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Single crystal piezoelectrics outperform their polycrystalline counterparts; in particular, their electric field strain magnitudes, coupling efficiencies and sensing dynamic ranges are the highest of known materials.  This makes them ideal for use in high-end applications such as ultrasound imaging, high power ultrasonic scalpels and naval sonar systems.  Here, we will use high energy x-ray scattering in transmission geometry to collect diffuse scattering volumes in-situ during AC electrical poling treatments and subsequent electric field cycling.  Such data will provide critical microstructural mechanism information to understand the underlying cause of these enhancements as well as guide future composition and post-growth processing treatments. Optimising electrical poling processes for single crystal piezoelectrics Luke Giles 1* Stefano Chechia 2* 1. School of Materials Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Australia 2052 2. European Synchrotron, Grenoble, France Diffuse scattering data was collected on a series of relaxor ferroelectric single crystal samples both Pb(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) and Pb(In0.5Nb0.5)O3-Pb(Mg1\/3Nb2\/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PIN-PMN-PT). Crystal cut orientations and electrical poling history\/in situ field application were chosen to investigate two pemomena, changes in nanoscale structure upon field-induced phase transformation along each of the three possible transition pathways (monoclinic a (Ma), monoclinic b (Mb) and monoclinic c (Mc)) and application of alternating current poling (AC poling) cycles. In each case the diffuse scattering data are analysed by resampling scattering intensity into 3D reciprocal space, and identifying the direction and distribution of diffuse scattering streaks in the vicinity of Bragg reflections. These streaks are indicative of the nano domain structure in the relaxor ferroelectric single crystals. Previously, this method has been used to look into the rhombohedral (R) to orthorhombic (O) transition (Mb pathway)  Where dissapearance of the diffuse streaking from samples undergoing the R-O (Mb) transition indicate a change from polydomain initial state to an essentially monodomain final state, the changes in streak intensity observed from the other transition pathways as well as changes in intensity observed stepwise along the transition will allow us to extract information about the way in which each of these transitions proceed. Similarly, macroscopic property data and diffuse scattering from (001)-cut crystals through AC poling cycles have been collected. These AC poling methods have previously been shown to promote long-range ordering of ferroelectric domains and correspondingly improve the measured piezoelectric coefficient (d33) up to around 10 cycles, however the structural changes on the nanoscale occuring throughout this transion are not known. The diffuse scattering collected collected through this experiment will allow us to understand the changes occuring on this shorter length scale throughout this process and therefore move closer to understanding the underlying reasons why the piezoelectric performance of the system is improved.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"This proposal aims at initiating a new synthesis method to deliver novel nanomaterials, by performing chemical reactions in molten salts as liquid reaction media at elevated pressures (2-6 GPa) and high temperatures (600-1100 C). We want to monitor reaction pathways as a function of pressure and temperature, by performing in situ X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) to identify reaction intermediates and products. We want to understand structural transformations during liquid-phase syntheses and identify promising compounds in order to design new electrocatalysts for H2 production from water. High pressures have never been coupled to molten salts for materials synthesis, despite the unique compounds accessible only at high pressures. We will focus on the Fe\/Ni-Si-B system for which the state-of-the-art reports a rich high-pressure structural diversity. Addressing this new synthesis method will require extending the use of recently developed resistive heated diamond anvil cells (RH DAC). This proposal aimed at initiating a new synthesis method to deliver novel nanomaterials, by performing chemical reactions in molten salts as liquid reaction media at elevated pressures (2-15 GPa) and high temperatures  As a general strategy, we followed the room pressure protocols for the nanoparticle syntheses in molten salts [e.g.  For a first study, from the planned Fe\/Ni-Si system, we focused on the Ni-Si sub-system for which we have previously succeeded to reach diverse nanomaterials in molten salts at room pressure  We have requested 4 cells for this experiment. Two cells for external resistive heating, which can reach max 600 \u00b0C eqipped with diamonds of 600 microns (for the lower pressures 2-5 GPa) and two cells with the internal heating system, possible to reach 900 \u00b0C, equipped with 500 and 350 micron culet diamonds (to reach 5-15 GPa). The cells were prepared during one week preparation session prior the beamtime. The external resistive heating cells required only gasket indentation, sample chamber drilling. The internal resistive heating cells requred special preparation lead by the beamline scientist A. Rosa with the help of the PI of this proposal. Firstly the gaskets were indented and drilled, subsequently the glue holding the diamonds was partly detached in order to let thermocouples to touch the diamonds for temperature measurements. The thermocouples were fixed to the cell seats using two types of glue (ceramic and condictive) in order to well isolate them from the oven part of the cell. Lastly the ceramic heater holders were put on top of the diamonds (small picture on the top of Fig.  In case of reaction with the diamonds, we have prepared several mixes, including the planned Ni-Si synthesis mix but also other chemical systems towards the synthesis of CuBS2 and BP in molten salts. Due to the steep melting curve of all salts, we decided to use the eutectic LiI+KI eutectic mixture, which melts at room pressure at 350\u00b0C. We performed 4 experiments: \uf0b7 External-RH-DAC: o NiSi_01_HT: Salt: eutectic LiI :KI + precursors: Na4Si4 + NiCl2 first increasing P to 6 GPa (56 bars), then up to 600\u00b0 C, decreasing the pressure towards melting of the salt, when back to 0 barmelting and then increasing pressure on the membrane until 56 bars. It appeared difficult to estimate precisely the pressure after melting of KI, but the pressure was probably in the range 1-2 GPa. o BP_01_HT: Salt: eutectic LiI:KI + precursors: NaBH4 + red phosphorus first increasing P to 2 GPa (44 bars), then up to 600 \u00b0C, decreasing the pressure towards melting of the salt, when back to 0 barmelting and then increasing pressure on the membrane until 58 bars. It appeared difficult to estimate precisely the pressure after melting of KI, but the pressure was probably in the range 1-2 GPa, but according to the cell parameters of the Re gasket: 3 GPa To sum up this first attempt of synthesis using molten salts and DAC resistive heating systems, the main challenge was to melt the salt eutectic mixes at the target PT conditions. Each time we had to decrease the pressure in order to obtain the molten reaction medium. This has caused difficulties in estimating the pressure of the synthesis reaction. Besides, the molten salts appeared as very corrosive towards diamonds. However a strong diffuse scattering signal from the eutectic molten salt has been recorded in all 4 performed synthesis with success (e.g. Fig.  The results of this beamtime are essential for continuation of the PhD thesis of A. S\u00e9n\u00e9 and will be continued further by a new PhD candidate in our team, hired both in the LCMCP and IMPMC.  As a first outcome of the beamtime, we achieved the planned PT conditions using the novel stups for external and internal RH-DACs. We succeeded to melt the salt and conduct the synthesis in the molten state, but we also detected an unexpected reactivity of the molten salt with diamonds. Another difficulty was the evaluation of pressure. Inded, the estimatation of pressure using the Re equation of state was not reliable at the low P that was required to kep the salt melted.Thanks to the newly published equation of state of KI  Unfortunetely we broke most of the diamonds. Most likely due to reaction between the molten salts and diamonds. The large change in volume upon melting could also play a role in these events.",

    "title":"Heating at the nanoscale as a possible mechanism for radiation damage and X-ray nanopatterning",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to investigate the role of heating at the nanoscale (both in time and in space) as one of the microscopic mechanisms possibly responsible for\r\nradiation damage. We want to measure the single-crystal XRD patterns and the corresponding lattice thermal expansion as a function of the photon flux density,\r\nfilling mode and sample temperature. These measurements will be compared to numerical predictions and will provide valuable information for defect engineering\r\nand X-ray nanopatterning (XNP). Material modification induced by X-ray irradiation is often considered an undesirable side effect in applications involving high brilliance sources such as 4 th generation synchrotrons, but it has been shown to be useful for functionalization of superconducting oxides such as Bi-2212  Because of the pulsed nature of synchrotron radiation, heating and XRD data collection are simultaneous, and the position of diffraction peak should give a direct measure of the thermal expansion due to the incoming X-ray beam. We employed a nanobeam with size 700\u00d7300 nm 2 (H\u00d7V) and a maximum flux of 9.9\u00d710 10 photons\/s, and performed the measurements with different incident photon fluxes, obtained by inserting a variable number of Al foils before the sample. In this way the temperature increase induced by the incoming beam should result in a shift of the diffraction peak under investigation towards smaller 2\u03b8 angles upon irradiation with high flux compared to low flux measurements. We could also test the reversibility or irreversibility of thermal effects by performing measurements at low flux alternated to high flux irradiation. We focused on thin films with thicknesses in the order of 100 nm of different materials, namely PbTe, KNbO3 and YBCO superconductor. Thin films were selected in order to have a uniform heating across the whole material and to remain in kinematic diffraction conditions. Measurements at different temperatures have also been performed to check the effect of temperature on radiation damage and reversibility of thermal effects. A liquid He flow cryostat has been employed to perform measurements at 10K, 60K, 100K and 295K. An in depth data analysis is still to be performed, but as it is shown in figure ",

Histology of organs after HiP-CT scanning reveals no obvious structural damage and proves equivalence of resolution for highest resolution HiP-CT and histology. 13. A publicly available database of the lungs, heart, brain, kidney, spleen has been created and published  Lungs, brain, heart, kidney and liver were collected from COVID-19 patients during autopsies in Hannover, or from Autopsy performed at the LADAF. Samples were embalmed and then immersion fixed for over 72h in 4% formalin and transferred to 70% ethanol (using stepped increase from 50-70% to minimise shrinkage and damage), leaving no viable tissue, cells or organisms (see Fig.  The HiP-CT scanning procedure adapts two protocols originally developed to image large fossils. The first, the attenuation protocol, normalizes absorption in the field of view [3 , 4]; whereas the second, the accumulation protocol, provides extended dynamic range  Lung biopsy samples were also prepared and scanned to compare to HiP-CT (Fig  Technique development: After preprocessing of radiographs to generate high-quality local tomography, image reconstruction can be performed using a filtered back-projection algorithm, coupled with single-distance phase retrieval  Using this pipeline we estimated the resolution of HiP-CT by Fourier shell correlation (FSC) analysis  Resolution was estimated at the half-bit criterion to be 10.4 \u00b5m \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5m for images at 2.5 \u00b5m per voxel, 18.3 \u00b5m \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5m for images at 6.5 \u00b5m per voxel and 72 \u00b5m \u00b1 3.4 \u00b5m for images at 25 \u00b5m per voxel. To assess the consistency in the quality of higher-resolution scans at different tissue depths and distances from the rotational centre of the intact organ, we analysed intensity distributions across two high-resolution VOI. We found that the image intensity histograms had an intersection of 71% \u00b1 3%. Both distributions showed positive skewing and kurtosis with minimal differences in mean intensities between the different VOI (Fig.  In addition, we quantified differences in image quality between the two volumes using the structural similarity index  By performing histopathological analysis following HiP-CT on areas of the organs that have received the highest X-ray dose we have demonstrated that HiP-CT does not cause observable morphological damage, leaving the tissue available for subsequent analysis not limited to histology but potentially also to spatial transcriptomics. Histological comparison also facilitates and validates our interpretations\/segmentations of HiP-CT, a key factor in developing image processing pipelines (Figure  We applied HiP-CT to image multiple length scales in a variety of human organs. Intact lung, heart, kidney, spleen and brain (Figure  In the brain, layers of the cerebellum were visible (Fig.  To exemplify how HiP-CT may be used in organ-wide mapping of tissue functional units, we have performed image segmentation and analysis on the smallest functional unit of the kidney -the glomerulus; measuring the total number, distribution and morphology of glomeruli across the kidney. These compare well to established histology methods and provide new measures such as surface area that cannot be measured with existing techniques. Sperrarterie (white arrows). These specialized arteries are essential for intrapulmonary arteriovenous shunting and are located mainly at the septal margin of secondary pulmonary lobules, where up to 3 to 5 such \"Sperrarterien\" anastomoses can be found in each lobule. Scale bar, 0.  Imaging the COVID-19 lung across various length scales in 3D has enabled clinicians to explore the extent and type of COVID-19 damage. In doing so several new hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of COVID-19 have been confirmed such as the anastomosis of pulmonary and bronchiole vascular systems Figure  We have also published quantitative analysis of the structural changes in the airspace morphology of in the COVID-19 lung as compared to a healthy control lung. We have shown that alveoli septum thickness increases, there is an overall loss of patent alveoli and alveoli ducts are dilated. We have shown significant differences in these damage patterns both within a single COVID-19 lung and as compared to a control lung. (Further details in  In addition to these published findings, we have also performed analyses demonstrating a co-localistation of specific damage patterns with secondary pulmonary lobule boundaries (conference presentation pending). HiP-CT data has been combined with clinical radiology datasets of COVID-19 where it has provided the means to correlate microstructural features to new phenomenon seen in clinical data e.g. airway tree-and-bud structures (publication in preparation). As well as to provide correlation and to molecular data to understand how molecular changes in patterns of angiogenesis lead to structural changes across the areas of the lung (publication in preparation). Through our various methodological developments, we have develop a new overarching methodology, HiP-CT, that enabled hierarchical 3D imaging of multiple intact human organs, providing consistently high imaging quality from whole human organs down to individual organotypic functional units and certain specialized cells at any location within the organ. Our exemplar of multiscale glomerular analysis demonstrates the benefit of hierarchical imaging with representative subsampling to estimate the number and morphology of spatially disparate (glomerular) organotypic features. We also leveraged the advantages of HiP-CT for multiscale and quantitative 3D analyses in pathological contexts, identifying and quantifying regional changes in the architecture of the air-tissue interface and alveolar morphology in the lung of a donor with confirmed pulmonary COVID-19 disease. HiP-CT has considerable translational potential for biomedical applications, which we demonstrated by 3D imaging of a SARS-CoV-2-infected lung. In addition to reproducing the histopathological hallmarks of COVID-19, HiP-CT revealed extensive regional heterogeneity in parenchymal damage, and arteriovenous anastomosis. Our HiP-CT approach clearly demonstrates how physical subsampling methods that aim to infer organ-wide pathophysiology could be confounded by such heterogeneity. This potential confounder is surmounted by HiP-CT due to its flexibility in the scale of tissue volume that can be imaged, independent of location and over a wide range of resolutions. Moreover, quantitative analysis of lung architecture from HiP-CT images aligns with clinicopathological observations of an increased volume of ventilated air that does not participate in gas exchange in COVID-19-related ARDS  HiP-CT will evolve alongside advances in synchrotron technology. Here, we present results using our experimental method developed on a test beamline (BM05). The completion of a new beamline at the ESRF, BM18, in 2022 is anticipated to provide increased resolution in volumes several times larger than human organs while using lower doses of X-rays with improved sensitivity and a much higher speed. Such fourth-generation synchrotron sources may herald new possibilities in the life sciences.BM18, specifically for phase imaging of large samples will dramatically increase the capabilities of this technique by making it possible to perform HiP-CT on the complete human body scale, with zooming capabilities down to the histological level, at lower X-ray doses.",

    "title":"Osteolysis in arthroplasty: The influence of metal exposure in peri-implant bone on the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network.",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The release of metals from arthroplasty implants can clinically manifest in aseptic osteolysis. In a recent synchrotron-XRF study performed at the ESRF, we found that Co and Cr released from arthroplasty implants integrate into peri-implant bone. However, it remains elusive whether metal integration into bone directly alters bone tissue homeostasis. Osteocytes are located in the lacunar network of the bone and are major regulators of bone tissue homeostasis. Thus, the proposed project aims to perform nanoCT analyses of human ex vivo specimens to systematically investigate the influence of metal exposure on osteocyte lacunae and the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network. Nano-resolution and a high sample throughput are mandatory to better understand the role of the osteocyte-network in the disturbed mineral homeostasis. The obtained results will provide new insights regarding the pathogeneses of metal exposure-induced osteolysis and potential treatment strategy in the future. Background: In a recent study, we found that cobalt and chromium released from arthroplasty implants integrate into peri-implant bone  Experimental part: In total we have performed 112 scans from 22 individual samples. The X-ray energy was set to 29.6 keV. Of each sample, we have collected two to three single-distance scans at 240 nm voxelsize, 64 scans in total. For 48 of those, a high resolution scan at 50 nm spatial resolution was acquired. The highresolution scans were obtained through collection of tomograms at 4 different sample detector distances as described previously  We could reconstruct all data and all data are largely exploitable. Some regions suffer from motion artefacts, probably induced by the X-ray dose during the scanning. The data are currently being analysed as described in the initial proposal: the morphology of the lacunar-canalicular network is quantified and related to the peri-iplant related metal release. Due to the complex segmentation of the LCN, this analysis is still ongoing. In Figure ",

    "title":"Microvascular disease induced osteocytic matrix changes in type 2 diabetic bone",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Patients with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of sustaining a hip fracture despite having normal or even increased bone mass. Bone is resorbed and formed continuously in a process that is regulated by several hormones and cells, including osteocytes, which are embedded in the bone tissue. Our preliminary data shows that microvascular disease, a well-known type 2 diabetes-related complication, is associated with enlarged osteocyte lacunae. We hypothesise that the bone matrix surrounding the enlarged osteocyte lacunae differs in mineral and collagen composition compared to bone matrix surrounding the smaller osteocyte lacunae from patients without microvascular diseases. We aim to test the hypothesis by high resolution scanning of thin bone slices from adult patients with type 2 diabetes with or without microvascular disease.  The aim of the project is to characterise the bone matrix surrounding the osteocyte lacunae (perilacunar matrix) to determine potential differences in mineral and collagen composition in type 2 diabetic individuals with and without microvascular disease. Previous work from Zanner et al.  With guidance from the beamline scientist, the frames containing the bone sections were glued to a small glass microscopy slide and a magnet was glued to the bottom of the glas slide to mount the samples on the sample stage. In addition, two frames were fitted on one piece of glass to reduce sample exchanging. The sample was mounted on a piezo stage enabling us to do fine scans while the hexapod underneath the piezo enabled for bigger movements to position the sample properly. We used a beam energy of 15.2 keV and the beam was focused down to 340 nm \u00d7 340 nm using a pair of silicon compound refractive lenses. Downstream from the sample a flighttube was placed immediately before the beam stop. The diffraction signal was collected by an Eiger 4M detector, while at an angle of app. 90 degrees towards the control hutch a Vortex-EM detector collected the fluorescence signal. For defining the region-of-interest (ROI) of high-resolution scans, a microscope was moved in downstream of the sample instead of the flighttube, beamstop, and diffraction detector. In total, 10 samples were measured (five samples per group, type 2 diabetes with and without microvascular disease). In pre selected regions (based on optical microscopy, see Fig  Following the beamtime, we have integrated the diffraction data with MatFRAIA  The influence of osteocytes on the diabetic bone fragility as well as the mechanism of osteocyte enlargement are still under debate and the results of the ongoing analysis are expected to have significant impact on both, the mechanisms in peri-lacunar remodelling and diabetic bone impairements. We expect the experiment to result in a publication pending the completion of the data analysis. ",

However, the fast solidification rates occurring during LAM encourage undesirable effects such as epitaxial grain growth and hot-tearing.

The huge industrial potential of LAM would be further unlocked by tailoring the \u2018un-printable\u2019 high-performance engineering alloys for the ultra-fast non-equilibrium solidification process. It is necessary to understand the highly transient mechanisms occurring during rapid solidification.

    "title":"A new microscopy of atomic motion in nanostructures",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to develop a new method to obtain direct space images, with ~30 nm resolution, of the atomic motion in GaN nanostructures. This new microscopy is based on the combination of Coherent Diffraction Imaging (to obtain direct space images) and resonant elastic scattering at forbidden reflections, which provides sensitivity to atomic motion, and is becoming possible thanks to the extreme brilliance of the new source. As a test case, we plan to investigate GaN nanopillars, where free surfaces, strain, crystal defects and inversion domain boundaries are expected to cause inhomogeneities of the atomic thermal motion. The prupose of this experiment was to develop a new microscopy, based on Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) and on the measurement of forbidden crystallographic reflections at a resonance edge. Under such conditions and in the wurtzite crystal structure, the retrieved direct-space image encodes the amplitude of thermal motion instead of the electronic density in the case of conventional Bragg CDI. However the thermal motion induced is not alone and dominates another temperature-independent amplitude only at high temperature  The beamline was aligned at the Ga K edge (~10.637 keV) and focused with compound-refractive lenses. With coherence slits closed to 0.5 mm x 0.14 mm (V x H), the beam size at the sample was 0.4 \u00b5m x 1.1 \u00b5m (V x H). The detector was a Maxipix and was mounted at 1.666 m from the sample. The sample was the same as the one which we previously inversion-domain boundaries  One of the difficulties of the experiment was to find several allowed reflections from the same nanopillar, in order to build an orientation matrix and then look for a forbidden reflection. We started with the (0,0,4) reflection, which is specular, and then looked for several off-specular reflections among the (1,0,4), (-1,0,4),  After aligning the (1,1,5) forbidden reflection on a first nanopillar, we attempted to record a speckle pattern with high statistics during a night scan. However we found out that the beam severely damaged the nanopillar (Figure  After destruction of the first nanopillar, we had only 24 hours left to complete the experiment. After characterisation of the radiation damage, we aligned another nanopillar. A reasonably good dataset was recorded in one hour (i.e. \u00bd effective acquisition time) on the (1,1,5) forbidden reflection of a pillar (Figure  Figure  After the measurement at room temperature, we started heating the sample and followed manually the (1,1,5) reflection during heating but we lost it. At 500\u00b0C, we could find the nanopillar again and measured the (0,0,4) and (1,1,4) allowed reflections. The diffraction patterns at room temperature and 500\u00b0C of the (0,0,4) reflection show that the crystal structure was intact (Figure ",

    "title":"Imaging the magnetisation vector field by Fourier Transform Holography",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Fourier Transform Holography (FTH) is an established microscopy technique with nanoscale resolution providing images of one projection of the magnetic moments in a thin sample. We propose to extend the scope of the technique by realizing a full vectorial determination of the magnetic moments in two test samples: one with Landau domains around a vortex core, and one with a skyrmion lattice. This improvement is highly desirable for the study of materials with complex magnetic textures such as skyrmions, chiral domain walls, Bloch points, etc... The present proposal aimed at unlocking the capability of X-ray-based Fourier Transform Holography (FTH) to image not only the scalar transmission of an object  Contrary to the aforementioned methods, FTH possesses the strong advantage of being self-referenced i.e. it is by nature mostly insensitive to sample drifts. With HERALDO, strong magnetic contrast at large incidence angles becomes accessible, thus allowing vector magnetic FTH by combining two orthogonal reference slits. Building on experience acquired at synchrotron SOLEIL, we fabricate isolated, finite-sized objects out of magnetic materials on one side of a thin Si3N4 membrane. A thick Au film is deposited on the other side of the silicon nitride window, then etched away with FIB to (i) define an aperture centered around the object of interest, and (ii) define two orthogonal extended reference slits, which correspond to traversing holes through the hole sample. Fe\/Gd multilayers The first sample we imaged on ID32 was an Fe\/Gd multilayer which also had been imaged at SOLEIL (SEXTANTS beamline). The stacking for this sample is as follows: Ta(6 nm) \/ [Fe(0.45 nm)\/Gd(0.96 nm)]600 \/ Ta(6 nm) This leads to an average composition Fe0.568Gd0.432. The total stack's thickness as determined from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements is about 800 nm. In terms of lithography, only FIB was performed to create an aperture in the gold (on the backside) to define a finite-size disk object, as well as two orthogonal slits traversing the whole sample. The following two images show the feature that was imaged, after milling, from the side of the magnetic multilayer (left) and from the side of the thick gold layer (right), focusing on one of the slits.  Dann112 is another Fe\/Gd multilayer with the following stacking: [Fe(0.37 nm)\/Gd(0.44 nm)]108 The total thickness is about 80 nm. This sample is similar to Beutier17 in terms of design: all four fabricated devices also feature two orthogonal slits and an aperture in its gold layer of about 5 \u00b5m in diameter to define an object. However, contrary to Beutier17, this sample's magnetic multilayer was further milled (inside the field of view defined by the apertures) into isolated disks in every device. The goal was to image an object that is fully contained inside the aperture instead of extending further: this situation (applying to Beutier17) leads to the presence of broad imaged regions that do not overlap for large differences of incidence angle. To put it differently: the actual field of view on the silicon nitride membrane changes with the incidence angle, and due to the thickness of the gold layer and the resulting shadowing, the larger the incidence angle, the further away from the aperture's center does the field of view's center lie. In order to overcome such issues, Dann112 was milled into disks of ca. 2.5 \u00b5m diameter. The following SEM image shows the disk that was imaged during this beamtime. The hole at its center traverses the whole sample, and was milled for the sake of aligning the multilayer's disk with respect to the gold aperture on the other side. Finally, the opening around the disk was created with a diameter of about 10 \u00b5m to make sure it would be larger than the 5 \u00b5m aperture in gold (on the other side). Fig.  On the next SEM images, the same structure is imaged from the side of the gold layer. The first image shows an overview, the two others focus on the aperture in gold and on the ends of the tips that were used for imaging. The spots on the second image consist of gold remaining after the etching; in addition, one can see the traversing hole etched in the center. The third image highlights the differences in slit shape resulting from two distinct milling strategies. The first one (top slit) with a \"spoon-like\" resulting shape aims at obtaining the narrowest possible slits but due to constraints in the motion of the ion beam as well as redeposition of material, the slit width is not homogeneous. Moreover, the width very close to the tip (ca. 80 nm) is very similar to the one obtained with the second strategy (bottom slit) which prioritizes a homogeneous width.  The teardrops were fabricated using electron beam lithography, followed by a deposition of a 80-nm-thick permalloy (Ni80Fe20) layer, then lift-off. The experiment was performed on ID32 in the usual chamber dedicated to FTH. We used the Fe L3 edge and Gd M5 edge to obtain magnetic contrast from our samples. The coherence of the beam was ensured by two pinholes of: the first one (100 \u00b5m in diameter) 3.56 m upstream the sample, and the second one (50 \u00b5m in diameter) 20 cm before the sample. In order to have access to the 3 components of the magnetization vector field, the beamline staff implemented a new azimuthal rotation supported by the existing tilt rotation. The azimuthal rotation, which fits in the 15 mm wide gap between the poles of the in situ electromagnet, allows rotating the azimuth by 90\u00b0, hence converting the tilt angle from one transverse axis to the perpendicular transverse axis. Because of the geometry of the azimuthal rotation, the tilt angle was restricted to +\/-45\u00b0. A new detector, an in-vacuum integration of a sCMOS camera \"Dhyana95\" from Tucsen (commercialized by Axis Photonique) with pixel size 11 \u00b5m, fully prototyped and tested at SOLEIL, was set-up in replacement of the old CCD camera. While this new detector could in principle tremendously speed up data acquisition  Fe L3 edge imaging and comparison between ID32 and SEXTANTS (Soleil) Below are two images for comparison; the left-hand side one was taken at SOLEIL, the right-hand side one on ID32, both were acquired at the Fe L3 edge: The levels of signal-to-noise ratio are quite comparable; it must be noted that the colour scales are adjusted to the images' extremal contrast values. However, on the image recorded on ID32, the contrast levels seem less well-defined over a domain than they are on the left-hand side image. One possible explanation is the different size of beam stop used on ID32 with respect to the SEXTANTS beamline at SOLEIL. Indeed, the size of the beam stop on ID32 normalized by the typical speckle radial width (estimated as a diffraction ring's full width) is larger than the same quantity evaluated from scattering patterns obtained at SEXTANTS. We find: As a result, even for an optimal beam stop positioning, more information at low wavenumbers is cut out on ID32; we think that this results in a high-pass filtering that is more pronounced than on SEXTANTS, and which explains the aforementioned difference. With the benefice of hindsight and Fe L3 edge absorption spectra acquired on SEXTANTS, we realized that FTH should be possible at the Gd M5 edge. At SOLEIL, we failed to perform imaging of sample Beutier17 at photon energies around the nominal value of the M5 peak; no speckle was visible on scattering patterns. We now understand this as a consequence of sample thickness: the amount of material traversed by X-rays is so large that the transmitted light becomes dominated by light other than the beam of interest  One solution consists in working further below the edge peak than what is usually done, in order to retrieve an X-ray absorption low enough to allow appreciable scattering. We did this on SEXTANTS, as illustrated by the following figure: This represents two transmission measurements: one through a beamline filter out of pure Fe, labelled as \"Ref.\", the other one through sample Beutier17. The black dot indicates the energy at which the FTH was performed at Soleil. It can be clearly seen that this found optimum lies well below the inflexion peak on the absorption edge, which is commonly the energy chosen for such measurements. On ID32, we found the peak of the Gd M5 edge at about 1189 eV, close to its nominal position. However, we found optimal contrast at photon energies around 1184 eV (and some non-vanishing contrast at 1180 eV still); the following figure displays the result of a reconstruction at this energy (right-hand side) and a reconstruction at the Fe L3 at SOLEIL (left-hand side): The same pattern as above can easily be recognized. We ascribe most of the differences to an unwanted highpass filtering of our scattering data due to the beam stop. As discussed above, the latter is larger (compared to the typical speckle size) than it is on SEXTANTS, and this only becomes more pronounced at higher photon energy. To further illustrate this effect, the following figure shows scattering patterns recorded (on ID32) on Beutier17 at the Gd M5 edge (left) and at the Fe L3 edge (right). Both patterns are represented in logarithmic scale, with an identical dynamic range with respect to the image's maximum. The comparison does convey the fact that at the Gd M5 edge, much of the central speckle is cut out, leading to a high-pass filter acting on our data; this is consistent with the rather sharp magnetic domain walls and aperture sboundary seen previously on one hand, and with the slowly-varying contrast across uniform domains on the other hand. As for the two bright dots on the top-right side of the beam stop, we attribute them to the presence of another aperture object as well as a fully traversing hole through the sample in the vicinity of the imaged aperture. The dots are most likely stray light scattered from these two features on sample Beutier 17. Although only little time was dedicated to measurements on Beutier17, several interesting elements of comparison with SEXTANTS as well as prospects regarding the development of ID32 can be drawn: \u2022 a quality of FTH images similar to that of SEXTANTS can be reached on ID32, in spite of the ESRF's being a synchrotron specialized for hard X-rays, \u2022 thick magnetic systems actually can be imaged provided the proper energy is found; moreover, we think our XMCD-FTH imaging at the Gd M5 edge on ID32 to be the first of its kind, \u2022 comparing the latter data with imaging done at the Fe L3 edge, we are able to identify the beam stop as a beamline element where improvements (in terms of size and shape) could clearly benefit the measurements. The teardrop sample was briefly imaged on ID32 with the goal to confirm and if possible understand the images taken on SEXTANTS. There, only weak magnetic contrast was observed, and instead of the broad flux-closure pattern expected for such a permalloy (Ni80Fe20) element, a large number of small domains were observed. In order to have a reference, the following figure presents an image of that sample taken at SOLEIL, at the Fe L3 edge: The left-hand side image is the dichroic contrast, the right-hand side is the charge reconstruction. The X-ray incidence angle is about 37\u00b0 (away from normal incidence). Quite clearly, the signal-to-noise ratio on the magnetic part is very weak. We could obtain a similar image on ID32 for an incidence angle of 40\u00b0, as shown below. Interestingly, the signal-to-noise ratio seems slightly better. We can identify at least a few common features in the dichroic images; notably, the bright crescent roughly in the middle of the teardrop. However, these are far from the expected pattern, which is schematically represented on the following figure. Here, magnetization is displayed as red arrows, the XMCD contrast as grey patches, and the blue dashed line corresponds to the domain wall which should form along the wedge's bisector. In order to try and obtain this pattern, we applied a magnetic field of about 0.45 T, with an angle between the field and the normal to the sample of 75\u00b0. In other words, the field was mostly in-plane with a 0.43 T component, and that component was aligned with the bisector of the teardrop's wedge. By contrast with the SEXTANTS beamline, where only much weaker fields can be produced in FTH (~20 mT), the availability of such strong fields on ID32 is a great asset for XMCD-FTH experiments. However, we obtained the following image after application of field: Unfortunately, we could not obtain any clearer dichroic contrast than in the above image. Considering the weakness of the magnetic signal, we chose to change sample. After the beamtime, we found that this image acquisition was particularly disturbed by issues with the camera's temperature regulation. The different devices under normal incidence Before focusing on the one disk that has been mostly imaged during this beamtime, we acquired images of all four devices that had been fabricated on Dann 112 with the X-ray beam perpendicular to the sample. Here is the image obtained on the first device or \"zone\": As a way to confirm that both slits can be used in this configuration, we checked e.g. on the 2 nd zone that images can be obtained from one or the other independently, as shown below: Both were obtained at the Fe L3 edge, using this device's vertical slit. Both were obtained at the Fe L3 edge, using this device's horizontal slit. The 3 rd zone did not show any clear dichroic contrast. The 4 th one, on which we performed almost all of our imaging in this beamtime, did display a promising dichroic pattern. The following two images correspond to the two orthogonal slits again. We point out that there is a replica of our object in the reconstruction (most visible on the charge image, to the left); it is a consequence of the \"spoon-like\" shape of one of the slits, cf. the sample fabrication subsection about Dann112. The part where it becomes thinner acts as a secondary tip due to the filter we apply in reciprocal space. Fig. 18: Magnetic (left) and structural (right) images of the fourth device patterned into sample Dann112. Both were obtained at the Fe L3 edge, using this device's vertical slit. One can see very clear worm-type domains as well as isolated, bubble-like domains. It must be noted that the white dots on the top \"Sum\" image are no artefacts: they correspond to the gold remaining after the FIB milling that defines the aperture on one side of the membranes. Below is shown a comparison between the FTH and SEM images: Many features appear common to both images, testifying to the quality of our reconstructions. We first show an image taken with 20\u00b0 incidence. Despite the not so great statistics, one can still recognize some specific domains seen in normal incidence. The following image was acquired at -35\u00b0 degree incidence, or equivalently 35\u00b0 degree incidence and an azimuth rotated by 180\u00b0. Since our goal is to demonstrate vector magnetic FTH, we also performed imaging after rotating the sample's azimuth by 90\u00b0 so as to use the other slit on this device and therefore gain sensitivity to the second in-plane component of magnetization. Here, we show two examples of imaging performed after rotating the sample's azimuth by 90\u00b0. The first image is taken with an X-ray incidence of -45\u00b0, the second one with +30\u00b0.  The final steps of our post-processing will be an attempt at combining our series of images (not all are shown here for the sake of clarity) and reconstructing the domain configuration in this Fe\/Gd patterned multilayer. Currently, we are still post-processing the data to that end. First of all, it must be noted that this beamtime has been significantly hampered by several kinds of camera issues. This is because its control under SPEC and under beam could not be tested before the beamtime. Overall, a combination of SPEC-related bugs and a camera operation still in the discovering led to a very unreliable image acquisition. A very large number of scans were interrupted because the camera stalled for reasons which are not yet fully understood. Moreover, we have found out that in certain cases the camera's temperature regulation aims at temperatures different from the user-defined target until a new scan ist started. Even after investigation by the beamline staff the reasons for this behaviour is not known. However, the consequence is that whenever this happens, the image quality decreases and degrades an entire scan. Finally, there have been gradual accumulations of matter on the detector chip, which of course deteriorate the image quality. This being said, already a significant number of control issues have been solved by the beamline staff and the remaining ones are going to be taken care of in the following months, allowing a smooth, stall-free camera operation. The beamtime's applicants are grateful for the instrumental developments that have been undertaken by the beamline staff concerning the installation, preliminary test and first use of this camera on the setup. Additionnally, they laud the design and successful use of a novel sample holder allowing for two azimuthal positions and continuous tilt while fitting into the electromagnet's 15-mm gap, thus allowing to use all of the available range of magnetic fields during experiments. The obtained tomographic image series and implementations regarding magnetic fields testify to the fruitful collaboration between the beamline staff and the group of applicants. In terms of experimental results, we have first shown that the image quality in XMCD-FTH on ID32 can be on par with that of the SEXTANTS beamline at SOLEIL (with sample Beutier17); in particular, we have determined working conditions yielding a much better coherence on ID32 while retaining sufficient flux for imaging. Then, we took advantage of the setup's electromagnet to perform a check on the NiFe teardrop sample that was not possible on SEXTANTS; unfortunately, this sample did not prove suitable for the magnetic vector imaging. Finally, we have performed two series of FTH imaging on the Dann112 Fe\/Gd multilayer, aiming at the announced vector tomographic reconstruction. Taking the numerous detector-related problems, we strived to measure at a larger number of angles rather than obtaining large statistics on a few sample tilts so as to prove the feasibility of the technique. The final steps of combining our acquired images in order to obtain a threedimensional, vectorial reconstruction of magnetization are still ongoing at the time of writing.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"High brilliant sources, IV generation synchrotrons and XFELs, open new capabilities to study materials with single high coherence shots. We want to extend our understanding of the dependence of the signal with dynamical diffraction in compressed  microstructures of High Z materials. In this effort, we want to image a model sample such as 5 um Ni single crystal micro-pillars using nanofocus diffraction tele-ptychography in diffraction direction. This technique was successfully implemented in the forward direction at NanoMAX to study nano-indented Si wavers. The study of the dynamical diffraction echoes in Ni in the diffraction direction can only be performed in a beamline with the beam properties and detector geometry such as ID01. This dynamical diffraction effect shows a femtosecond time dependence that could be used to reconstruct ultrafast 3D maps of lattice oscillations in metals, semiconductors or other functional materials microstructures.  The sample was mounted in the center of rotation of the goniometer, in the focal plane of the FZP (with a foci of 76 nm at 8.3 keV) on the PI x-y piezo stage. A pinhole with diameter of 3 \u03bcm was mounted on a Npoint stage (provided by the users) to scan the pinhole in the plane perpendicular to the diffracted beam, at few mm beyond the sample. The Eiger detector was placed 5.3 m downstream the pinhole in the diffraction direction, 2\u03b8~43.16 o to collect the DD signal [2. The Ni micro-pillar were aligned to the asymmetric (111) LD reflection. A scanning diffraction map of the sample, taken without the pinhole, was performed to localize the pillars and select areas to investigate. The selected areas from the map were measured using a pinhole scan over an area of 10x10 \u03bcm 2 , enough to collect the echoes produced. We have several problems during the experiment as the new control software was implemented during that week. Also the detector Eiger2M (ESRF-PSI collaboration) due to some errors limited our time of collection. Everything was solved and the team of ID01 also gave extra inhouse beamtime to us to recover for the inconvenience. The support of ID01 was really good also, as due to COVID a lot of members of our group were not able to attend to the experiment. The part of the data is analysed a manuscript has been written for submission in Optica in relation to the Si wafer studies. The Ni data is still under analysis. As presented in the Figure  We would like to also add the information from the strain observed in this study to a mayor publication together with extra data collected at NanoMAX in the forward direction, explaining better the technique and the simulations performed. In the case of the Ni pillars, we observe the echoes signal as proposed, that is observed in Figure ",

    "title":"Imaging the magnetisation vector field by Fourier Transform Holography",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Fourier Transform Holography (FTH) is an established microscopy technique with nanoscale resolution providing images of one projection of the magnetic moments in a thin sample. We propose to extend the scope of the technique to the full vectorial determination of the magnetic moments in 3D samples. This improvement is highly desirable for the study of materials with complex magnetic textures such as skyrmions,  chiral domain walls, Bloch points, etc\u2026 Our previous beamtime yielded encouraging results, but severe issues with the detector prevented us from taking a full data set of suffient quality. We wish to complete our study. The purpose of these experiment is to develop a new 3D and vectorial tomography technique for magnetism, based on Fourier-transform holography (FTH). FTH is now a well established technique for magnetic imaging in 2D, in which a projection of the magnetisation vector along the beam axis is measured. In FTH, a reference wave is used to encode the phase of the object of interest. The reference wave is created by drilling a smal aperture traversing the sample support. Small circular holes are the usual choice for the reference, but other shapes can be used. Slits are convenient and allow tilting the sample to measure various projections of the magnetisation (Figure  Figure  During MI-1384, we did not have enough time to record sufficient data for a 3D reconstruction, because: -we tested several samples to find a magnetic texture interesting for 3D reconstruction -the sCMOS camera used to record the data was progressively stained by water droplet, corrupting the holograms, which in turn compromised the quality of the reconstructed direct-space images. For this continuation experiment, we chose to focus on teardrop-shape samples in permalloy, because micromagnetic simulation suggested that they should host a complex 3D magnetic texture spanning all orientations of the magnetic moment (Figure  As said above, the data were more and more contaminated by dark spots due to water condensing on the detector chip. Its origin remains unclear. The work-around startegy was to interrupt the experiment to \"bake\" the chip at 30-40 \u00b0C for a few hours. This procedure allowed to get rid of most of the stains. ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"In recent years, X-ray scattering has received a significant boost due to the increased use of machine learning strategies in the analysis of data acquired at synchrotron sources. With this proposal we intend to leverage ML based real-time data analysis integrated into modern beamline environments and thereby provide low-barrier access to ML based techniques for many user groups visiting photon sources. As a proof-of-concept, we aim at growing organic molecular thin films of two distinct molecular components, monitor the growth with X-ray reflectivity and establish a closed loop between real-time, ML-based online data analysis and the sample environment to tailor the deposition process of organic thin films on molecular monolayer level. We propose to grow multilayers of the two organic molecules PTCDI-C8 (N,N\u2032-dioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide) and the N-alkane (TTC, C44H90) which are known for their high degree of structural order and layer-by-layer growth modes. In recent years, X-ray scattering has received a significant boost due to the increased use of machine learning strategies in the analysis of data acquired at synchrotron sources. This experiment contributed to the use of online data analysis in XRR at the ESRF. However, the tested approach is well suited for a broader range of in situ and in operando experiments for processes in dynamic equilibrium where the information extracted from the scattering data itself can be used to stabilize the equilibrium.

    "abstract_inverted_index":" Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a potential bioscavenger of toxic organophosphates. It can be used as an antidote to protect acetylcholinesterase and is a protein of choice for development of detoxification biocatalysts for clinical applications. To date, all the attempts to obtain the atomic structure of the full-length glycosylated tetrameric BChE were unsuccessful. The aim of the project was to use Cryo-EM technique to reveal the structure of the native tetrameric BChE and to clarify the details of its tetrameric and dimeric interfaces. Based on our preliminary experiments we estimated the optimal concentration of the sample for the experiment, prepared the grids and conducted Cryo-EM experiments at the ESRF instrument equipped with K2 detector.   Frame alignment and dose weighting were performed using UCSF Motioncor2. CTF estimation on aligned, unweighted, micrographs was performed with Gctf. All data processing steps except for the particle picking procedure were conducted in RELION 2.1. The BChE particles were picked automatically using Gautomatch software ( The dataset was collected using a K2 detector on a Titan Krios electron microscope. Raw particles showed a moderate distribution of the expected tetramers, and reference-free 2D averages (Figure  1 Calibrated pixel size at the detector 2 According to",

We have obtained excellent results by using the crystal direct technology to prepare crystals for diffraction experiments at ESRF. We recommend CrystalDirect technology to be introduced as a constitutive component of the beamlines. ID30B was used for native phasing (S-SAD) it would be nice to establish a ready-to-run protocol for this. We are extremely grateful for the generous support of ESRF and EMBL colleagues. RNA N  New therapeutic strategies targeting influenza are actively sought due to limitations in current drugs available. Host-directed therapy is an emerging concept to target host functions involved in pathogen life cycle and\/or pathogenesis, rather than pathogen components themselves. Therefore, scientists form the IBS and EMBL, in collaboration with colleagues from Institut Pasteur and the Universities Paris Diderot and Paris Descartes, focused on an essential host partner of influenza viruses, the RED-SMU1 splicing complex. Combining structural biology and molecular dynamics, they identified two synthetic molecules targeting an interface essential for RED-SMU1 complex assembly. They solved the structure of the SMU1 N-terminal domain in complex with RED or bound to one inhibitor identified to disrupt this complex. They show that these compounds also decrease endogenous RED-SMU1 levels and inhibit viral mRNA splicing and viral multiplication, while preserving cell viability. Overall, their data demonstrate the potential of RED-SMU1 destabilizing molecules as an antiviral therapy that could be active against a wide range of influenza viruses and be less prone to drug resistance.

Littlechild studying thermophilic enzymes with potential for application in industrial biotechnology. Here, collaborative work is reported covering involvement at the phasing\/refinement that reflects a substantial contribution by Isupov (NB this work may therefore be covered in other BAG reports). The Spencer group studies mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and publishes a study on novel beta-lactamase inhibitors. The Coker\/Cooper groups work on a range of medically important proteins focusing on both understanding their mechanism of action and rational drug design. Excellent. Thank you for support on beam lines. We note that ID30B and ID23-1 have been particularly useful for studying metal binding and collect S\/MAD data. We note that use of spectroscopy facilities, both on and offline (ID29S) has been instrumental. We are mindful to further incentivize uptake of automated data collection by users in this bag (MASSIF). In the following, we report some use of beamlines, and note that these still contain structures \/ papers arising from data collection on ID14 beamlines. In the study of Vitamin B6 biosynthesis, the Tews group have made use of both online and offline spectroscopy using beamlines BM30 and ID29, as well as ID29S. Crystallographic work used several ESRF beamlines, namely ID14-1, ID14-4, ID23-1 and ID29 over a timeframe of nine years and was published in Nature Chemical Biology. Work like this requires an integrated approach and the mixed portfolio of beamlines that ESRF offers. The large complexes of the general transcription factor TFIID studied by Berger make particular use of an integrative structural biology approach, using SAXS data to complement crystallographic structure determination, and also EM. In immunology work Tews compares crystallographic structure with in-solution behavior determined by SAXS and brings in molecular dynamics simulation for interpretation of the biology. This is a further example of an integrated approach and has benefitted from the availability of a high quality SAXS station and support at BM29, essential to this work.

BEAMLINE: ESRF BM14, ID14-2, DLS I02, DESY\/EMBL X11 and SRS PX9.5 We determined the X-ray crystallographic structure of a F(ab) fragment in complex with CD32b, the only inhibitory Fc-gamma receptor in humans, and compared the structure of the F(ab) from the crystal complex with SAXS data for the F(ab) alone in solution. We investigated changes in F(ab) structure by predicting theoretical scattering profiles for atomistic structures extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and assessed their agreement with experimental SAXS data. Principal component analysis from the MD trajectory allows the evaluation of the influence of structural motions on the fit. Changes in the F(ab) elbow angle were found to be important to reach agreement between the crystal structure and the experimental SAXS data; however, further discrepancies were apparent. By analysing multiple MD structures observed in similar regions of the principal component analysis, we were able to pinpoint discrepancies to a specific loop region in the F(ab) heavy chain. This method, therefore, not only allows determination of global changes but also allows identification of localized motions important for determining the agreement between atomistic structures and SAXS data. In this particular case, the findings allowed us to discount the hypothesis that structural changes were induced upon complex formation, a significant finding informing the drug development process.

PDB: 5OCC Architecture of TAF11\/TAF13\/TBP complex suggests novel regulation properties of general transcription factor TFIID Fig 1. Left, Crystal structure of single chain version of general transcription factor TFIIA. Right, Model of TAF11\/TAF13\/TBP complex generated using SAXS data, available crystal structures and crosslinking data in an integrative biology approach. Amino acid residues crucial for complex formation are highlighted (light blue, space filling). General transcription factor TFIID is a key component of RNA polymerase II transcription initiation. Human TFIID is a megadalton-sized complex comprising TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TBP binds to core promoter DNA, recognizing the TATA-box. We identified a ternary complex formed by TBP and the histone fold (HF) domain-containing TFIID subunits TAF11 and TAF13. We demonstrate that TAF11\/TAF13 competes for TBP binding with TATA-box DNA, and also with the N-terminal domain of TAF1 previously implicated in TATA-box mimicry. In an integrative approach combining crystal coordinates, biochemical analyses and data from cross-linking mass-spectrometry (CLMS), we determine the architecture of the TAF11\/TAF13\/TBP complex, revealing TAF11\/TAF13 interaction with the DNA binding surface of TBP. We identify a highly conserved C-terminal TBP-interaction domain (CTID) in TAF13, which is essential for supporting cell growth. Our results thus have implications for cellular TFIID assembly and suggest a novel regulatory state for TFIID function. ESRF played a significant role in this study by providing access to x-ray and SAXS beamlines. ID29 was used to obtain the crystal structure of TFIIA S-C . BM29 was instrumental in obtaining high quality of SAXS data used in this study to build ab-initio models of various TAF complexes. This SAXS data was then used to generate the model of the whole TAF11\/TAF13\/TBP complex which enabled us to do mutational analysis in order to discover the novel mechanism of transcription regulation.

    "title":"The S. aureus aberrant large ribosomal subunit with bL27 Nterminal attached to catalytically inactive Prp cysteine protease.",
    "abstract_inverted_index":" Ribosomal protein bL27 is a component of the large ribosomal subunit found only in eubacteria and in the ribosomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. The bL27 N-terminus protrudes into the PTC and has been shown to play a critical role in substrate stabilization during protein synthesis  Ribosomal protein bL27 is encoded by rpmA gene, its deletion in E. coli led not only to a severe growth defect but also harmed the peptidyl transferase activity  Our collaborators, Prof. Gail Christie (Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Virginia, USA) have demonstrated, in unpublished work, by complementation analysis that not only bL27 is essential, but its cleavage is essential for cell growth. Therefore, the action of Prp is a bona fide novel drug target. The decrease of growth in these strains indicates that the ribosomal particles they produce are probably not active, therefore should shed more light on the role of bL27 in assembly. bL27 is known to be one of the last proteins that join the large subunit assembly process  Prp provides a target for the development of antibiotics specific to S. aureus and other related Firmicute pathogens in which this specific bL27 processing occurs. The structure of Prp bound to its substrate is not known, and that structure is the most desirable one for structure based drug design. The existing crystal structure of S. aureus Prp (PDB ID: 4PEO) lacks the loop that includes the active site residues histidine 22 and cysteine 34. Structural modeling based on functional analysis of the Prp enzyme suggests rearrangement of the flexible loop upon binding of the correct peptide substrate is required for the active site to assume the proper conformation.  S. aureus with full length bL27 and a plasmid with catalytically inactive Prp mutant C34A were grown (limited by 3-4 doubling times of the bacteria because they rely on existing healthy ribosomes to continue growth). The inactive Prp mutant C34A which binds to un-cleaved bL27 before or during assembly, was overexpressed. This binding causes a build-up of pre-50S (aberrant) particles that are highly toxic to the cell and cannot form 70S particles  Full length bL27 rProtein, with un-cleaved 9 amino acids at its' N-terminal, as well as Prp enzyme C34A mutant were detected by LC-MS\/MS in the aberrant 50S particle sample.The presence of full length bL27 rProtein, with un-cleaved 9 amino acids at its' N-terminal and Prp enzyme in the aberrant 50S particles peak was also examined by Western blot, using polyclonal antibodies . bL27 was detected in aberrant particles as a doublet that appears to contain large amounts of un-cleaved bL27 and only a small amount of the cleaved form. In addition, Prp enzyme was detected by immunoblot in the aberrant 50S particles sample. Cryo-EM grids (Quantifoil 2\/2 with 2nm continous carbon) of the aberrant 50S sample were prepared from solutions of concentration of 0.2mg\/ml. Data were collected on the Titan Krios FEI operating at 300 kV acceleration voltage at CM01 beamline, Grenoble, France and at a nominal underfocus of \u0394z = (-0.6)-(-1.5) \u03bcm using K2 GATAN camera and automated data collection with EPU software. The camera was calibrated at nominal magnification of 130K\u00d7 resulting in 1.067 \u00c5 pixel size at the specimen level. The camera was set up to collect 30 frames, total exposure time was was 6sec with a dose of 27.4 \u0113 \u00c5 -2 (where \u0113 specifies electrons). Data processing was done using RELION 3.0 ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":" Proposal Summary (should state the aims and scientific basis of the proposal): High-resolution structure of the TH:14-3-3 complex Tyrosin hydroxylase (TH), a homotetramer (224 kDa), is an enzyme involved in catalysing the hydroxylation of L-Tyr to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the rate-limiting reaction in the synthesis of dopamine and other catecholamines like noradrenaline and adrenaline, which modulate blood pressure and other functions  The aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (AAAHs) constitute a family of enzymes that catalyse the hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids using tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as cofactor. There are four genes coding for these enzymes in mammals, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 and 2 (TPH1 and TPH2). TH is fundamentally localised in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral sympathetic neurons and the adrenal medulla. Mutations in TH are linked to TH deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised either by progressive, hypokinetic-rigid syndrome and dopa-responsive dystonia, or by a more severe phenotype and complex encephalopathy that is less responsive to L-DOPA treatment  Samples will be vitrified and mounted in our Institute and will be sent to Grenoble prior to our visit. We want to acquire more data using a K2 detector in counting mode, with a sampling resolution around 1 \u00c5\/pixel. If possible, we request three days (9 slots) of data acquisition to accumulate enough data to generate a very highresolution 3D reconstruction of the TH:14-3-3 complex. Illnesses caused by TH malfunction, in most of cases due to mutations, have important biomedical implications. A complete understanding of the complex structure, catalytic mechanism, and regulatory properties of human TH , in this case in complex with its modulator 14-3-3, requires high-resolution information, preferably at atomic resolution. -Obsil T, Ghirlando R, Klein DC, Ganguly S, Dyda F (2001).

    "abstract_inverted_index":" The rapid emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria, alongside the negligible activity of the major pharma companies, cause a world crisis. Hence, the current situation is frequently described as a \"catastrophe\". Consequently, in 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the antibiotic resistance is leading to \"post-antibiotic era\", and declared it a substantial threat to human health. Even the World Bank estimated that up to 3.8% of the global economy will be lost by 2050 because of resistance to antibiotics. The ribosomes, the multi-components (rRNA and rProteins) universal cellular particles that translate the genetic code into proteins are the target for ~40% of antibiotics in clinical use. During the last three decades the structure and function of the ribosomes have been the main objects of our scientific activities. Within this framework, we determined the structures of several bacterial ribosomes, and decifered how the currently used antibiotics paralyze them, as well as the molecular bases of the various resistance mecanisms. Among those we focused on the ribosome inhibition by Linezolid (Fig.  Cryo-EM grids (Quantifoil 2\/2) of the SA 70S ribosome (SA70S) complex samples were prepared from solutions of concentration of 1mg\/ml.

Scientific background: Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is a direct compound semiconductor that has a wide bandgap of 3.91 eV, a high index of refraction and high transmittance in the visible range. ZnS nanoparticles are useful as photo-catalysts and devices such as fluorescent displays, electroluminescent devices, light-emitting diodes, infrared windows, lasers and sensors. We synthesize in the lab highly uniform, ultranarrow ZnS nanowires and nanorods using zincethylxenthate precursor molecule and octadecylamine as both a surfactant and solvent  Photoluminescence results of ZnS nanowires and nanorods in chloroform suspension show that the emission increases upon decreasing the concentration, which is not an obvious result (Figure  Our main goal was to investigate the structure evolution in suspensions of the highly uniform ZnS nanowires and nanorods in different various conditios: concentrations, temperatures and solvents for suspensions. Using SAXS at BM-29 we measured the ZnS nanowires and nanorods in different concentrations and temperatures. The results of the ZnS nanowires and nanorods in chloroform with different concentrations shows a clear trend of peak enhancement with the increase in the concentration, as expected (Figures  1 2 3 4 5 6 q (nm -1 ) 0.05 mg\/ml 0.1 mg\/ml 0.25 mg\/ml 0.5 mg\/ml 1 mg\/ml 2.5 mg\/ml 5 mg\/ml ZnS nanowires 5.29 nm 2.66 nm 1.77 nm 1 2 3 4 5 6 q (nm -1 ) 0.05 mg\/ml 0.1 mg\/ml 0.25 mg\/ml 0.5 mg\/ml 1 mg\/ml 2.5 mg\/ml 5 mg\/ml ZnS nanorods 5.03 nm 2.69 nm 1.78 nm    The results from these short and preliminary experiments show that both ZnS nanowires and nanorods form liquid-crystal like structures in suspension.

Research groups from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and Kingston University (KU) are joint co-applicants as they have strong links and collaborations with groups from ISMB. All groups share common interests in disciplines including structural, chemical, molecular and cell biology; using multidisciplinary and multiscalar approaches. ISMB, UCL, QMUL and KU investigators, ranging from early-career research fellows to internationally-established senior academics, apply X-ray crystallography carried out mainly at our Wellcome funded facility at Birkbeck, as an essential method enabling: i) description of the atomic-level mechanistic details of macromolecules and macromolecular machines, and ii) structure-based drug discovery, while iii) complementing and supporting cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) projects. \u03b3SA PLC core nSH2 cSH2 sPH SH3 nPH TIM barrel Active site (IP3 + Ca 2+ ) 2. Fragment-based screening of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 reveals ligand-binding sites and cross-inhibition with other medically relevant coronaviruses School of Pharmacy: Shumeng Ma, Shymaa Damfo, Jiaqi Lou, Haider and Frank Kozielski; Birkbeck College: Nikos Pinotsis; ESRF: Matthew Bowler Non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), a unique viral protein, has been shown to be a crucial virulence factor causing host mRNA degradation and suppressing interferon (IFN) expression as well as host antiviral signaling pathways. In view of the essential role of nsp1 in the coronavirus (CoV) life cycle, it is regarded as a potential target for antiviral agent discovery. No inhibitors of nsp1 have been reported do far. Our project aims at identifying fragment hits as a starting point for the development of more potent analogues by fragment-based screening of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 via x-ray crystallography. Subsequently, ligands binding sites were identified and characterised, followed by chemical optimisation of hits using structure-based drug design. We expressed, purified and crystallised SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and determined its structure improving the recently reported resolution from 1.6 \u00c5 to 0.95 \u00c5. The space group is P43212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals diffract routinely to below 1.6 \u00c5 resolution and are stable in the presence of DMSO for several hours, excellent conditions for fragment-based screening using x-ray crystallography at ESRF beamline Massif-1. After optimising soaking and cryo-conditions we collected datasets for ca. 600 nsp1-fragments soaks and ca. 40 native crystals for the ground state in batches of 200 crystals in automated mode. Automated data collection parameters were further optimised between batches to increase data quality. We identified, verified, and confirmed 9 nsp1-fragment complexes so far through PanDDA analysis. This number is at the lower end of success rates reported for fragment-based screening, however, it should be noted that nsp1 is a relatively small protein of 17 kDa (Figure  Additional reports from usage of beamlines: Use of the beamtime over the last 6 months (1) Crystals were screened of a conformation ('latent') of AAT that mimicks the subunits of the pathogenic aggregates that underlie alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. These ordered aggregates are not suitable for crystallography because they are flexible and have heterogenous size. Diffraction was successfully obtained to ~4\/3 \u00c5 when processed isotropically\/anisotropically, respectively. Molecular replacement provided a solution in the P1 space group with 8 molecules in the asymmetric unit. (2) We have developed a toolkit of monoclonal antibodies that are able to recognise this protein selectively in different conformational states. As well as informing on the structural changes that result in aggregation and loss of activity, these antibodies have significant potential as clinical diagnostic tools. The 9C5 monoclonal antibody is used routinely in our lab in immunoassays, cryo-EM and has potential as a clinical diagnostic tool. Unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain a dataset of a complex between Fab9C5 and AAT with a resolution better than the current ~3.9 \u00c5. (3) Based on an earlier dataset collected at the ESRF that provided a high-resolution structure of a complex between a monoclonal antibody and AAT, small molecules were shortlisted in silico and screened by NMR with the aim of developing a non-invasive clinical imaging reagent. Small molecules with binding activity were soaked into crystals of native and cleaved AAT. Datasets were collected between 2-4 \u00c5, with the identification of an improved cryo-condition at the same time, however no unequivocal small molecule density has yet been identified. (4) Neuroserpin is a member of the same serpin family as AAT and is expressed in developing neurons. Mutants of this protein are associated with severe familial dementia. In support of a cryo-EM project in which aggregates of neuroserpin are labelled with an antibody ('1A10') Fab domain, we have performed crystallisation trials of the Fab alone and in complex with wild-type neuroserpin. A dataset was obtained of 1A10 Fab alone to 3.6 \u00c5(iso)\/3.0\u00c5(aniso), and we identified very low resolution diffraction (>10 \u00c5) in crystals of the complex which now need to be improved. Human MCAK structures in the absence (nucleotide-free) and presence of various nucleotides (Mg 2+ ADP, ATP-like states represented by AMP-PNP and ATP\u03b3S) have been determined and the structures are being prepared for submission. To finish the manuscript, we are attempting to increase the resolution of one of the structures, the MCAK-AMP-PNP complex, which is currently at 3.3 \u00c5 to below 3.0 \u00c5, which delays the manuscript a bit. We are also attempting to obtain crystal structures of MCAK-AMP-PCP and MCAK-'ready-to-split' complexes. The manuscript is in preparation  We have collected data on a large variety of crystals of M. tuberculosis FtsZ with fragments. These complex structures reveal novel inhibitor binding sites and will allow conducting structure-based drug design (in progress). These complex structures will serve as a basis to develop inhibitors with higher potency and efficacy. We conducted fragment-based screening of dengue virus and zika virus methyltransferase (MTase) at DLS collecting diffraction data of around 700 MTAse-fragment soaks. The data allowed us to identify a range of novel ligand binding sites on MTase. As the crystals showed twinning and contained eight molecules in the asymmetric unit, which led to very long refinement for each individual complex, we searched for novel crystallisation conditions. Shymaa Damfo, the PhD student working on the project was able to grow a new crystal form, space group C2221, diffracting routinely to better than 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. We therefore switched to this untwinned crystal form collecting native diffraction data and three MTase-fragment analogue complexes at the ESRF. These structures will allow structure-based drug design (in progress) and will serve as a basis to develop MTase-targeting inhibitors with higher potency and efficacy. We also remeasured untwinned crystals of dengue MTase in the presence of all 39 fragment hits at the ESRF and processing of all datasets is currently in progress. The data collected at the ESRF will be included in the second manuscript on dengue MTase, once we published the initial fragment screen. We also collected data at Massif beamtime for dengue RdRp in complex with fragments (about 200 data sets). Data have been processed using the PanDDA software from DLS and seven fragments binding to DENV RdRp have been identified  We collected several datasets of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (nsp5) to a resolution of 1.6 \u00c5 in space group P212121. We soaked or co-crystallised nsp5 crystals with three potential new inhibitors, but did not observe any electron density for the inhibitors. We are in the process of establishing novel collaborations with medicinal chemists to develop potent nsp5 inhibitors using structure-based drug design. We collected several datasets of SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 to the best resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 in space group P63. However, datasets are not of high quality due to imperfect crystals. We are in the process of screening for better crystallisation conditions to obtian better diffraction data of the protein crystals. We also conducted fragment-based screening via x-ray crystallography for SARS-CoV-2 nsp10. Overall, the nsp10 fragment screening project is slightly less successful than nsp1 as we profited from the mistakes done during the nsp10 project: although still routinely diffracting to better than 2.0 A, the resolution of the nsp10 crystals is not as good as for the nsp1 crystals. Nsp10 crystals are also more difficult to soak as drops sometimes form a skin preventing the fragments to soak into the drops. The reproducibility of nsp10 crystals is also an issue. Initially, we soaked cocktails of five fragments at 5 mM concentration (a total of 500 fragments), but did not identify any bound fragment. We therefore avoid measuring fragment cocktails, which is more work and requires more beamtime, but this represents the more successful approach. Nevertheless, we managed to collect ca. 600 individual fragments soaked with individual fragments and identified and verified ten fragment hits. 8A55 (native, atomic resolution), 8ASQ, 8AYW, 8AZ8, 8AYS, 8AZ9, 8A4Y The work of the Larsen team is focusing on new inhibitors for the HIV capsids. In a second project they are looking for interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 protein ORF6 (p6) with human proteins in order to develop efficient drugs for the treatment of the virus infection: Ten data sets were collected on id30B and id30A-1 of the HIV-1(M) capsid protein (CA) soaked with peptides derived from known co-factors(Nup153, Sec24C) as well as a new drug. Unfortunately, despite using a proven soaking protocol, the ligands were not observed within the solved structures. Furthermore, one dataset of Human Importin (KPNA2) soaked with a peptide derived from the HIV-1(M) protein Vpr were collected, but the Vpr peptide was not seen in the obtained crystal. Cells are constantly subjected to oxidants that in turn can damage all their constituents. They therefore rely on complex systems to sense the redox balance and activate the detoxification machineries. Failing at maintaining the redox balance is a hallmark of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We are interested in the major regulator of the oxidative stress response in eukaryotes, the Nrf2 pathway. We are also interested in a newly identified post-translational modification occurring during oxidative stress. Under oxidative conditions, co-enzyme A (CoA) can react with cysteines in proteins to protect them against further oxidation, alter their function, their oligomeric state or cellular location. We are focussing our attention on two proteins shown to be derivatised by CoA, Prdx6 and NME-1. We obtained crystals of the repressed and active form of the promoters that encompass Nrf2, an accessory protein and DNA. Over the last year, we screened about 70 crystals with different DNA lengths. Unfortunately, we didn't observe diffraction below 7\u00c5. Future approaches will focus on screening more oligonucleotides, microseeding matrix screening, cryo-protection optimisations, and crystal dehydration. Concerning Prdx6 and NME-1, we screened about 80 crystals and collected about 30 datasets between 2 and 2.5\u00c5 resolution for both proteins. Unfortunately, only residual density was found in the composite map for Prdx6. We did identify CoA binding site in NME-1, but couldn't observe covalent bond between CoA and the protein. We are currently exploring the relationship between oligomeric state and derivatisation by CoA. The Wallace Group's work is focused on elucidating the nature of the transmembrane drug interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels. These studies include comparisons of native and mutant sodium channels, where the mutations were designed to inhibit the drug binding. Many data sets have been collected at the ESRF to screen for drug complexes in the previous period, but none of these have led to data that was included in any publications. Most of our work in this period built on the previous period, where we developed methods to allow protein-drug interactions to occur but without devasting loss of diffraction. This has required at lot of screening. Using this approach, we have improved things to the point that we now have high quality datasets for some protein-drug interactions, and while others remain elusive data are gradually improving as we learn more using our time at the synchrotrons. Once we publish papers about these complexes, (even if the final datasets do not come from the ESRF), we will acknowledge use of all the facilities used in the evolution of the projects as they will have all contributed to the final outcomes. Data collected on i-motifs in the current cycle (mx2415) relates to use of id30b on the 22nd of July 2022. Data on NOS i-motifs have been collected to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution and we are now attempting structure solutions. Screening was also undertaken on ILPR soaked with cobalt, but these crystals did not diffract. Additionally, HJ\/protein complexes were screened but did not diffract to sufficient resolution of the collection of data. Our research is focusing on the myomesin protein family which is an essential protein for striated muscle contraction. Myomesin proteins bind to the thick filaments and keep them align around M-band which is the centre of the sarcomeric unit. Here we initially measured the C-terminal domain 12-13 of myomesin-2 a protein overexpressed in heart and fast twitch muscles. Although we did an extensive screening using several beamlines, we obtained a single data set to a maximum 3.41 \u00c5 resolution. Although the resolution is relatively low, we were able to solve the structure revealing a similar motif to myomesin-1. We also observe minor conformational differences of the overall architecture suggesting protein plasticity. In a second project we measured the C-terminal domains 12-13 of myomesin-1 including the C-terminal linker which was not previously included in the already published structures. These data were collected in ID23-1 and they diffract to a maximum resolution of 2.35 \u00c5. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and currently is getting refined.",

Our local contact at the facility was Traore Daouda. The facility provided excellent services, meeting all of our needs in a timely and professional manner. The facility staff were knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire process. Communication with our local contact was fluent. We held a brief meeting to discuss the details of the acquisition and he frequently reported the status of the acquisition during the session. He also provided us with clear instructions about how to transfer the data to our machines. Finally, we found the data processing services at the facility very convenient. Our samples also returned correctly to our laboratory. As for the details regarding the data acquisition and processing, our sample was vitrified in UltrAufoil R0.6\/1 grids and 21341 movies were recorded at a pixel size of 0.84. After motion correction and CTF estimation, micrographs (16195) that displayed a better than 3.5 A resolution were selected (Figure  From 150 micrographs, 252,270 particles were reference-free picked using the general model from crYOLO, extracted with a box size of 256 px and binned to 64 px. After two rounds of 2D classification, 67,258 particles were selected and subjected to ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC. The best model was refined to 3.4 A using the non uniform refinement job from CryoSPARC with the unbinned particles. A set of 100 projections was generated from the resulting model (low-pass filtered to 20 A), which were used for particle picking with Gautomatch. Approximately, 6.1 million particles were picked for each subset, which were processed independently. Resulting picks were extracted using a box of 256 px, binned to 64 px and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification using CryoSPARC (Figure  and used for a non uniform refinement job using the best ab initio model as reference. A map of 2.7 A resolution was obtained. The same processing pipeline was applied to another subset of 3239 micrographs.

Our aim was to trap specific AMPA receptor complexes in open conformations. In the first session, we obtained good quality 2Ds but most of the receptor was in a desensitized conformation (2D averages, panel A).

It was the first cryo-data collection of this specimen.We encountered a problem with the EPU software at data-collection: the software failed in the identification of holes in the Quantifoil film, with a large number of positions placed on the carbon instead. We did trials with different hole patterns size (R1.2\/1.3 and R0.6\/1) and the problem persisted in all of them. We attributed the problem to the sample characteristics: dark electrodense thick viral particles distributed in the holes as well as in the carbon, producing similar electrodensity on the hole and carbon film. Additionally, as EPU was not recognizing the physical holes well, the threshold for empty\/full ice holes didn\u00b4t work as well. An attempt to use SerialEM instead of EPU did not improve the situation. Nevertheless, we managed to collect over 16000 movies, although some hundreds were taken on the carbon (Fig.  At present, particles are being picked manually using XMIPP, as autopicking by either XMIPP or GAUTOMATCH produced suboptimal results. In the movies collected, we can observe viral particles in different states of assembly\/disassembly: full (gen ome-containing), empty, and partially filled particles (Fig.  With this data collection, we hope to have enough particles to obtain at least a medium resolution first 3D map of the virus, to determine whether on the whole the capsid is icosahedrally ordered, determine its triangulation number, and start modelling the major capsid protein.

A total of 9241 and 13213 movies were acquired for TH\u039435(DA) and THS40p respectively, at a nominal magnification of 81,000\u00d7 with a defocus range of -1.6 to -3.4 \u03bcm. Movies were fractionated to 40 frames with a total exposure of 2 s for both samples. The electron dose was 30 e-\/\u00c52 (Supplementary Table  To save computational time during the first processing steps and to increase the signal to noise ratio, particles were downsampled by a factor of 4, and extracted with Xmipp3 -extract particle. The extracted particles were subjected to a first 2D classification using Relion 2.0 and the best classes were subjected to several further rounds of 2D classification, allowing a much better detection of bad particles such as aggregates or particles that were very close to each other. and THS40p, image processing was performed following similar steps and using Relion-377 and cryoSPARC78. The 3D reconstruction process was carried out with D2 symmetry imposition. After several rounds of 2D and 3D classification, 152,128 and 148,453 particles were re-extracted at the original pixel size and used to generate the final 3D maps at 4.6 and For 3D reconstruction, different de novo initial models were obtained using both EMAN272 and RANSAC73. Another initial model was obtained by low resolution (60 \u00c5) filtering of the atomic structure of the CD of the human TH (PDB 2XSN). The first rounds of 3D classification were performed using Relion 2.0 without any symmetry imposition and using the different initial models. No significant differences were found among the best class obtained from the low-pass filtered atomic structure and the de novo initial model. Particles belonging to that class were subjected to refinement using Relion 2.0-3D auto-refine software. Since clear symmetric features were observed in this class, we sought to determine whether C2 or D2 symmetry was applicable and could contribute to better define our 3D models. The final resolution was 4.7 \u00c5. ESRF BAG report The Iberian cryo-EM Community BAG states were refined, yielding resolutions of 4.5 and 6.6 \u00c5 for native I and II states, respectively. (d) The C2 symmetry of the native, semi-activated I plus II and activated states was expanded and the particles from each state were subjected to additional 3D classification without alignment. Classes representing equivalent conformational states (percentages relative to the parental state are indicated) were pooled, resulting in 3D reconstructions of four new intermediate transient states. closed vault map and 7539 particles were selected to calculate the half vault map. The initial model for Class3D was generated from a previous atomic model (PDB: 4HL8) of rat vault low-filtered to 60 \u00c5 resolution to eliminate the risk of model bias. In the closed vault reconstruction, particles were subjected to consecutive Class3D and Refine3D jobs and additionally to CTF refinement and particle polishing. This class was refined separately with RELION by applying D39 symmetry. To enhance the signal, a mask was generated around the whole vault, obtaining a map after RELION postprocessing of 3.7 \u00c5. The resolution was determined based on a \"gold standard\" FSC coefficient of 0.143. A model of the vault particle (PDB ID: 4HL8) was docked into the map using UCSF Chimera, and Coot was used to manually adjust these initial models. An initial round of refinement was performed in Phenix using real-space refinement. In the case of the half vault, Class3D analysis allowed to calculate a map that presented a reasonable resolution (around 14 \u00c5). This half vault class was refined separately with RELION by applying C1 symmetry. To enhance the signal, a mask was generated around the whole half vault, obtaining a map after RELION postprocessing of 9.3 \u00c5. The resolution was determined based on a gold standard FSC coefficient of 0.143. The vault in committed conformation was obtained by the data analysis of the second dataset. A total of 207,815 particles were automatically picked using RELION (21) with a 700 \u00d7 700 pixels box. All picked particles were classified using RELION in a 2D classification process (Class2D). A total of 11,666 particles were selected for further 3D classifications (Class3D) that yielded the vault reconstruction in committed conformation. This class was refined separately without imposing any symmetrical condition, obtaining a map of 7.9 \u00c5. The resolution was determined based on a gold standard FSC coefficient of 0.143.",

    "title":"Solution structure of nucleases from three staphylococcal species and the high temperature and salt tolerance by SAXS",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Nuclease has important application in modern therapy biotechnologies which, however, requires salt tolerant and active at a broad range of temperature. To achieve such a \u201cuniversal\u201d nuclease, the relations between these properties and the primary sequence is needed. The aim of the project is using SAXS to determine and compare the folding\/unfolding as well as monomeric\/oligomeric state of three staphylococcal nucleases in dependence to increasing temperature (up to 50 oC) and NaCl concentration (up to 1M).  As viral therapy technologies have advanced, the need to develop reliable production strategies has grown. For example, many promising gene-therapy strategies use adeno-associated virus (AAV) or other viruses as a vector. However, a challenge in the production of viruses is residual DNA released from the host cell. An effective strategy for reducing residual DNA is to use a nuclease. Since high levels of NaCl are often used to improve recovery during AAV purification it is essential that such biotechnologically used nucleases are salt tolerant (0.5 NaCl) and active at 25 to 40 o C  Using NucA, a well-studied nuclease, as a reference, the goal of this proposal is to characterize the three Nucleases systems (NucA, Nuc13 and Nuc19) for their stability under the crucial application conditions including salt tolerance and high temperature using SAXS. Previous work has shown that NucA and Nuc19 are highly stable, whereas Nuc13 form oligomer or clusters overtime. During this beamtime at BM29, we measured the three nuclease systems for 5 different concentrations ranging from 1 mg\/ml to 10 mg\/ml, and 5 temperatures up to 50 o C, and proteins with different salt concentrations (NaCl), buffer and co-factors. Most of the measurements were successful and the data are in high quality. One example shown in Fig.  Intensity q (nm -1 ) Nuc19 1 mg\/ml Nuc19 10 mg\/ml Nuc19 2 mg\/ml Nuc19 5 mg\/ml concentrations. These high-quality data will be further analysed to obtain the information of protein size (radius of gyration, Rg) and molecular weight as a function of protein concentration, temperature, salt concentration, to reveal their stability and tolerance with salt. The broad biotechnological application of nucleases requires high salt tolerance and high temperature stability. The structural study of this work for three staphylococcal nucleases with different primary sequences together with their activity property determined in our laboratory will provide crucial information about the relation between the primary structure and its properties. We are currently preparing a manuscript based on the SAXS data collected in this beamtime. Furthermore, we have used this opportunity to measure a series samples of protein-polyelectrolyte coacrevates, i.e. BSA with PDADMAC. The mixtures undergo a liquid-liquid phase separation, and this system can be used as a model system for the understanding of the structure, interaction, and partitioning of both protein and polyelectrolytes within the biological condensates. Further studies and research will be proposed based on these test results for further beamtime applications.",

The ability of PbS NCs to form highly ordered superlattices, e.g. upon solvent evaporation, makes them interesting for potential electronic and optoelectornic applications, such as solar cells, field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors etc. Synchrotron in situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle Xray scattering (WAXS) are the techniques of choice for studying of the time-resolved assembly of NCs into superlattices with subsecond temporal and micrometer spatial resolution. During the provided beamtime, we investigated the detailed transitions from the colloidal suspenstion to the self-assembled superlattice upon controlled solvent evaporation in real time using a combination of SAXS and WAXS. A dedicated sample environment  The experimental parameters of the beamline were as follows. The energy of the incident X-ray beam was set at 12.46 keV and the beam size was 70 \u00b5m (vertical) x 120 \u00b5m (horizontal). The SAXS data were recorded by the Eiger2 4M detector at the sample-to-detector distance of 1.7 m. Images were collected with exposure times of 0.05 seconds. For the chosen exposure times no beam damage of the sample was observed. Monodisperse PbS NCs were produced in our laboratory by a wet chemical method at different sizes in the range of 4-7 nm in diameter and stabilized by oleic acid ligands. After the synthesis, the nanoparticles were purified and different experimental protocols were used to obtain NCs with various ligand grafting densities. Due to the facetted nature of the PbS core with {111} and {100} facets and different binding energies of oleic acids molecules to the {111} and {100} facets, the post-synthesis processing plays an important role in the obtaining of the higher or lower coverage of organic ligands on the inorganic NC core. Besides the influence of the NC size on the self-assembly outcome, the effect of the ligand grafting density on the superlattice transitions was studied in the allocated beamtime. Figure  The results are planned to be further analyzed and published in the near future. ",

The ultimate goal is to unveil the correlation among the fine structural in-membrane organisation and transport properties in order to  understand the microscopic mechanism of water flow. \r\nSuch an understanding will favor further chemical design and optimisation of these novel artificial water channels.\r\n The experiment aimed at characterizing the structural organization of artificial water channels in a planar lipid bilayer formed by a set of molecules (I-quartet imidazole) that have demonstrated to have high transport potentiality and ionic selectivity. These molecules mimic natural aquaporine-like behavior, and have strong technological potentiality in the field of water purification  Since this was the first experiment on these systems, we devoted a significant part of the beam time to find the best conditions to optimize the X-ray measurements and assess the conditions to minimize the radiation damage. After these conditions were founds, we performed XRR scans of the pristine DOPC lipid bilayer adsorbed on Si substrates before and after the addition of the imidazole molecules on different I-quarted imidazole molecules (HC8, HC4, S-HC8 and HC6). A GISAX measurement was performed for the HC6. The liposomes were prepared using the film rehydration method. 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) in CHCl3 (25mg\/mL, 4mL) was used as lipid support for the vesicles. The solvent was evaporated on a rotary evaporator and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 3h. The lipid film resulted was rehydrated under vortex with 5 mL 10 mM PBS (pH = 7.4) at 25 \u00b0C for 1h to give a milky suspension. The resulting suspension was subjected to a 10 freeze-thaw cycles using liquid N2 to freeze and warm water bath to thaw. The suspension was extruded (using an Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. extruder) through 100 nm polyethersulfone membrane (Whatman, UK, 0.1 \u00b5m) for 21 times to obtain monodisperse unillamelar vesicles and then diluted with the same buffer into 25 mL. Vesicles solution (LUV with diameter 100 nm, concentration of DOPC was 4 mg\/ml in PBS buffer solution 7.4) was poured out on cut silicon wafer with dimension 20mm*30mm and left to form bilayer for 15 min, after that 4 mL of the same PBS buffer solution was added to the cell in order to stop the forming of lipid bilayer by dilution of vesicle solution. Injection of compound was done by adding of DMSO solution to the sell containing the lipid bilayer formed on silicon substrate and PBS buffer  Measurements on ID10: we performed a set of XRR measurements on supported lipid bilayer before and after the addition of all the different imidazole molecules: HC8, HC4, S-HC8 and HC6. In Figure  We had the time to perform only one GISAXS measurement on the sample DOPC sample treated with the HC6 (Figure  This first set of experiments shows that the combination of XRR and GISAXS is an optimum tool to elucidate how the incorporation of different pore forming molecules remodulate the structural properties of lipid bilayer formed by single lipid species.

    "title":"Controlling chain entanglements in bottlebrush polymers for biomedical applications",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Brush architecture disentangles network strands, increases osmotic pressure, and weakens the elastic force towards enhanced swellability. However, steric repulsion between side chains also leads to backbone strand extension resulting in increased non-linear stress response, which counteracts swelling. This tug-of-war governs the resulting mechanical properties of swollen gels and remains poorly understood. It is clear that brush side chains play multiple roles that may either promote or suppress gel swelling.\r\nIn the present experiment, we will explore properties of bottlebrush-based elastomers upon exposure to various solvents. By performing in-situ USAXS\/WAXS couples with fast mechanical stretching and heating of swollen samples we are planning to uncover the architecture-mediated interplay between gel assembly, swelling and mechanics. This knowledge will enable fabricating soft materials with orthogonal control of chemical composition, mechanical properties, and functionality. Combining softness, firmness, strength, and damping into a neat material is incompatible with current polymer network designs, yet such a combination is commonplace in biological tissues.  Despite recent advances in replicating tissue's softness and strain-stiffening,  Herein, we present the bottlebrush graft copolymer (A-g-B) platform, which delivers robust physical networks where a single molecule connects multiple meshes (as designated by the bold backbone) empowering a unique combination of softness, firmness, and strength (Fig.  Incorporation of bottlebrush macromolecules into elastomers has led to a breakthrough in mechanical property control of polymer networks.  Fig.  blocks yet remain stretchable due to the ''hidden length'' of coiled A-blocks inside the network nodes.  Synthesis A-g-B brush-like graft copolymers are defined by a set of six architectural parameters [n sc , n g , n A , f A , n bb , n x ], where n sc is the degree of polymerization (DP) of the side-chains in the brush B block, n g is the DP of backbone spacer between side chains, n A and f A are respectively the DP and volume fraction of linear A-blocks, n bb is the DP of a brush backbone, and n x corresponds to the backbone DP between A-blocks equivalent to the DP of network strand (Fig.  ), PDMS macromonomers were co-polymerized with n-butyl acrylate (BA) as backbone spacers between PDMS side chains yielding poly[nBA-ran-MMAg-(PDMS\/PMMA)] graft copolymers with n g = 4-8 (Fig.  To demonstrate the universality of the platform and its modular nature in addressing specific applications, we prepared A-g-B graft copolymers with different chemical compositions of A-blocks and B-side chains. For example, PMMA A-blocks were replaced with polystyrene (PS) (ESI, \u2020 Sections S1.7, S1.8 and Scheme S3) to enable elastomer fluidity at B100 1C for molding and 3D printing. By substituting PDMS side chains in the B-block with higher glass transition polyisobutylene (PIB) (ESI, \u2020 Section S1.6 and Scheme S2), we augmented viscoelastic dissipation at room temperature and conventional strain rates, thereby enhancing adhesion and vibration damping. For scalability, the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods were replaced with free radical polymerization (FRP) to synthesize PS-g-PDMS (n g = 8) and PS-g-PIB (n g = 8) (Fig.  Chemically dissimilar blocks undergo microphase separation.  molecular structure and morphology of self-assembled A-g-B networks.

The chemical variability accommodates specific functions such as thermal stability, adhesion, and molding (Fig.  Fig.  The A-g-B brush platform enables immense expansion of the mechanical property scope of thermoplastic elastomers by independently tuning elastic and viscoelastic properties. Specifically, a unique combination of softness, firmness, and strength was attained through coordinated variation of the side chain length, grafting density, volume fraction of A blocks, and interconnectivity network cells. Furthermore, specific properties like molding, damping, and pressure sensitive adhesion were adjusted by varying the chemical composition of the A and B blocks. Specifically, A-g-B materials achieved strength of B10 MPa, exceeding that of blood vessels, and closely replicated frequency dependence of the damping factor of super-soft brain and super-tough ligament tissues.

Using X-ray cross correlation analysis (XCCA) in Ultra-small angle scattering (USAXS) geometry, correlations of local order will be accessed beyond the first neighbour shell by correlations of different q-values to validate the predictions from simulations. Thomas Zinn  In the proposed experiment, we wanted to probe the structure of different complex liquids beyond the first neighbour shell. Recently, a novel type of a four-point correlation function has been presented that probes the particle density in three dimensions from simulation snapshots of a dense Lennard-Jones liquid  The experiment was performed at beamline ID02. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the experiment was performed remotely with users joining via videoconference. As samples we used five different batches of silica particles dispersed in water. These charge-stabilized systems show a rich phase behaviour covering liquid, crystal and glassy states  We used a USAXS geometry with 20 m sample-detector-distance. For each sample we performed various Xray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) runs at different sample spots to measure the dynamics. Therefore, we used the Eiger500k detector to achieve shortest time scales. Afterwards, the X-ray cross correlation analysis (XCCA) runs were performed. Here we changed to the Eiger4M detector to cover full qrings necessary for XCCA. This was done by performing mesh scans on the sample and repeat the mesh several (up to 10) times which guarantees sufficient statistics for XCCA  An example for the XPCS results from a dilute sample is shown in figure ",

    "title":"Time-resolved structural organization and dynamics of colloidal gels submitted to combined shear flow and ultrasound waves: break-down\/build",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Controlling the time-dependent mechanisms of fluidization or softening of colloidal gels by external forces like shear flow or ultrasound (US) waves, is a major challenge in many industrial applications (coating, cement placement, tires, chemical, bio and agro industries). The evolution of the rheological properties of colloidal dispersions from gel-like to fluid-like behavior and the reversibility of the sol-gel transition, constitute in many cases the aim of the process or has a huge impact on the final product properties.\r\nIn this work we aim at studying the effects of combined shear flow and US on colloidal gels. First, we will study the time-dependent evolution of the structural organizations of attractive aggregated colloids forming typically heterogeneous fractal open structures. Second, on repulsive colloids forming homogeneous space-filling structures, we will focus more precisely on the change in dynamics at micrometer length scales induced by acoustic waves propagation. The focus of this project is to study in-situ the combined effect of shear flow, pressure and ultrasound waves on the structural organization of colloidal suspensions with the aim of developing novel tunable nano-to micro-structured materials. Accessing a wide range of length scales, subnanometric to a few micrometers will shed light on the orientation mechanisms and structural organizations induced by the relative intensity of these external forces. Recently, we were able to evidence the ability of the ultrafiltration processes to develop well-defined layered structures of anisometric colloidal particles aligned horizontally along the velocity direction from nanometer to micrometer length scales  Following these initial results, our goal in this proposal SC-5110, was to study by time-resolved in situ SAXS, the time dependent mechanisms leading to orientations during ultrafiltration process in the absence or presence of ultrasounds. The final aim was to develop well controlled multi-layered cellulosic films with alternate perpendicular and parallel orientations on each successive deposited layers. A dedicated SAXS channel-type ultrafiltration\/ultrasound cell was implemented at ID02 (Fig.  Thanks to this set-up and in situ SAXS, typical multilayer orthotropic structuring that mimic the articular cartilage organization was achieved in one single (Frontal Ultrafiltration \/ Ultrasound) (FU\/US) processing on CNC suspensions (Fig.  The first layer (1000 \u03bcm-thick) pertaining to the superficial zone was composed of tightly packed CNCs with their directors aligned parallel to the membrane surface, and a concentration gradient reaching up to 48 wt% at the membrane surface (Fig.  From the 2D saxs patterns, the anisotropy Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were calculated in the (0.071-0.368) nm -1 q-range, using SASET software. It allowed to follow the time dependent evolutions of the anisotropy levels of CNCs orientations inside the differents zones as a function of filtration time and distance Z from the membrane surface (Fig. ",

    "title":"Exploring phase behavior in azido-acetylene monomers by in-situ combination of ultra-fast chip calorimetry and microfocus X-ray scattering",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"This research will be carried out in the framework of a Soft-Matter Partnership agreement we recently signed with ESRF. In the previous LTP (SC3457), we designed and implemented our custom-built fast chip calorimeter at the ID13 beamline and showed the principal possibility of combining nano- and micro-focus X-ray scattering with quantitative thermal analysis on the nano-scale (nanograms of the sample and submicron spatial resolution). The focus here will be put on the structure and complex thermal behavior of six types of energetic azido-acetylene monomers that can be used to synthesize hyperbranched polymers. The proposed in-situ experiment should help to separate the different physical and chemical transformations of the samples, such as melting, polymerization, evaporation and decomposition and the effect of spontaneous heating observed in bulk samples. Isotactic polypropylene (iPP) combines simple chemical architecture with distinctive polymorphic behaviour and is one of the most intensely studied semicrystalline polymers. When iPP is cooled down slowly from the melt it can often yield several crystalline polymorphs such as \u03b1-monoclinic, \u03b2-hexagonal, and \u03b3-triclinic. Quenching iPP melt (cooling rates higher than approximately 100 K s -1 ) may also produce a mesophase consisting of conformationally disordered crystals  Nanocalorimetry allows the study of minute quantities of material at very high heating\/cooling rates up to approximately 10 6 K s -1  Combining fast calorimetry with other X-ray diffraction characterization techniques remains a challenge, although some successful experiments employing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for studying natural polymers or chromatography for studying propylene copolymers have been reported in the past  The polymorphic behaviour of materials can be conveniently visualised using continuous cooling transformation (CCT), continuous heating transformation (CHT) and time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams  The melt-spun iPP filaments with well-defined diameters and crystallinity with Mn = 58 kg mol -1 and Mw = 161 kg mol -1 were provided by Total Petrochemicals. A detailed characterisation, including the degree of crystallinity of the iPP samples used in this work, has been reported elsewhere  was calibrated using several corundum reflections. The calorimetric measurements were performed with MEMS-type sensors XEN-39392 (Xensor Integration B.V.EJ Delfgauw, The Netherlands) assembled on a ceramic flat plate. The active area of the sensor Si x N y membrane was 100 \u00d7 100 \u00b5m 2 . Nanomaterials 2021, 11, 2652 4 of 12 of the ESRF (Grenoble, France). X-ray photons with an energy of 14.92 keV were used. The footprint of the beam on a sample of about 150 \u00d7 150 nm 2 was achieved using silicon-based compound refractive nano-focusing X-ray lenses with a focal length of 14 mm  The thickness of the silicon nitride membrane of the integrated sensor was 1 \u00b5 m, and it was transparent to the X-ray beam. For 2D WAXS analysis of the isothermal melt crystallization experiments an acquisition time of 1 s was used. The binning of 4 \u00d7 4 pixels was selected to achieve a compromise between a high time resolution and the collected number of counts. The detector saving time of 0.4 s resulted in a WAXS sampling rate of 1.4 s.  The flat sensor was used in transmission mode at the ID13 nanofocus beamline of ESRF (Figure  The flat sensor was used in transmission mode at the ID13 nanofocus beamline of ESRF (Figure  Nanomaterials 2021, 11, 2652 5 of 12 to the CR state is shown in Figure  To investigate stability of the iPP crystals formed from the mesophase, we subjected our samples to a series of heating cycles with different heating rates. The TT profile that was used is shown in Figure  Nanomaterials 2021, 11, 2652 6 of 12 CR_M1 and CR_M2 morphologies comprise three different phases: crystalline, mesomorphic, and amorphous. The relative contents of the crystalline and mesophase fractions depended on the temperature. Increasing the temperature from 363 K to 368 K resulted in an increase of the crystalline fraction from 20% to 28% and a reduction of mesophase fraction from 14% to 10%. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the mesophase converts directly into the monoclinic crystal phase via the perfection and reorganisation mechanism, which could be similar to mesophase annealing that has been reported previously  To investigate stability of the iPP crystals formed from the mesophase, we subjected our samples to a series of heating cycles with different heating rates. The TT profile that was used is shown in Figure  Another TT profile was used to examine the real-time isothermal melt crystallization of iPP (Figure  Nanomaterials 2021, 11, 2652 7 of 12 (points 1 and 2 on the TT profile in Figure  Another TT profile was used to examine the real-time isothermal melt crystallization of iPP (Figure  The nanocalorimeter instrument used in this study can efficiently perform the thermal analysis of a very small quantity of material. The greatly increased sensitivity of the instrument is because much higher heating rates are achievable compared to conventional DSC. The nanocalorimetry sensor consists of a suspended micrometer-thick silicon-rich Si x N y membrane that contains integrated resistive heating elements and thermocouple hot junctions located within 50-100 \u00b5m of the heater strips (Figure  The use of a nanosized beam provides a unique advantage over conventional WAXS by allowing the study of local crystal organisation with high spatial resolution. Using nanofocus 2D WAXS, we were able, for example, to determine that the poly(propylene adipate) crystals form spirals and not helicoids, giving rise to unique non-radial growth  In the past, comparable times of 0.1 s to 0.3 s for mesophase formation during the isothermal crystallization of iPP were deduced from the position of the exothermic peaks recorded with fast differential scanning calorimetry  In this work, we consistently detected a delay in the mesophase formation of approximately one second under isothermal conditions at a range of supercooling temperatures (Figure  In conclusion, we reported a successful experiment that was conducted using our dedicated custom-built ultrafast chip-based nanocalorimetry instrument designed for use with the ESRF high intensity nanofocus X-ray beamline. Our experimental approach revealed novel insights into fast structure formation processes in an industrially important semicrystalline polymer. In this work, we reported on the nucleation time and transformation kinetics of the mesophase in iPP and documented its direct transition through perfection and reorganisation into monoclinic crystals upon heating or isothermally and quantified the mesophase to alpha-phase crystal fraction in mixed mesophase-crystalline morphologies of iPP. We showed that disordered iPP crystals formed from the mesophase become unstable at heating rates above 40 K s -1 and exhibit melting temperatures ~30 K lower than those measured for crystals formed by slow cooling. The time-temperaturetransformation diagram was generated for a wide range of temperatures, from 308 K to 388 K, by performing isothermal melt-solidification of polymer microdrops. The TTT chart revealed the complex phase behaviour of iPP as a function of the crystallization",

    "title":"Unique double discotic D-A-D type molecule with exceptional out-of-plane mobility",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The proposed experiment is focused on investigation of microstructure and thermal properties of an organic \u201cdouble discotic\u201d semiconductor with exceptional in-plane and out-of-plane charge mobility. We are planning to perform microfocus diffraction experiments combined with ultrafast heatings and coolings of thin films to determine thermal regimes for formation of columnar liquid-crystalline (LC) phase with conjugated junctions between neighbouring columns. These junctions provide formation of a continuous conjugated network in LC phase that is the reason for unusually high out-of-plane charge carrier mobility. Charge transport is known to be a limiting factor in the performance of organic electronic and photovoltaic devices. Much effort has therefore been devoted to better understand the relationships between molecular structure, self-assembling and charge transport and to develop materials with high charge carrier mobilities.  In this study, we explored the self-assembly and charge transport properties of this TAT-based dumbbell-shaped derivative in greater depth in order to elucidate and take advantage of the unique structural properties of this molecule to achieve efficient 3D charge transport. The out-of-plane hole mobility was measured in space-charge limited current (SCLC) devices and reached a maximum SCLC mobility of 0.17 cm 2 V \u00c01 s \u00c01 for the crystalline state, close to the highest values reported to date for soluble small molecules,  The chemical structure of the investigated TAT derivative, labeled TPD C8 -TAT C8 , is depicted in Fig.  The structure and morphology of TPD C8 -TAT C8 thin \ue103lms, on either silicon or glass\/ITO substrates, were investigated by Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS). Details on \ue103lm deposition and thermal processing are given in Section 3. The GIWAXS pattern obtained on as-deposited \ue103lms displayed the characteristic broad scattering signals of the frozen columnar-nematic phase shown by bulk material (Fig.  As with the bulk material, speci\ue103c heating conditions in the range of the \ue104uid nematic phase (see Experimental section) initiates a crystallization process (Fig.  The GIWAXS pattern of a crystallized \ue103lm is henceforth composed of spot-like re\ue104ections due to the spontaneous orientation of crystallites with respect to surface (Fig.  which corresponds to the lateral arrangement of piled molecules. Given that both parameters of the unit cell are close to each other and that the angle is not too far from 120 , it can be supposed that the observed crystalline phase stems from the parent hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase. Crystalline domains are predominantly oriented with the (a, b)-plane orthogonal and b-axis parallel to substrate, implying that the directions of molecular piling lie in the \ue103lm plane as for the initial mesomorphic structure. The grouping of strong re\ue104ections at low q x is consistent with this \ue103nding. Unfortunately, the diffraction peaks in the wide-and medium-angle range are broadened and cannot be resolved in individual re\ue104ections, which precludes the full determination of the three-dimensional structure at this stage. At the same time, all trials to grow crystals from solutions failed, presumably because a mesomorphic state was systematically obtained. It turned out that the crystalline state is currently only available through the above-described thermal treatment in form of microcrystals, which are unsuitable for laboratory XRD. However, it was possible to conduct complementary microfocus X-ray experiments on individual microcrystals of a crystallized thin \ue103lm using synchrotron radiation. Spatially resolved X-ray diffractograms were obtained by performing 2D scans of large crystals with a step of 1 mm. The aim of the measurements was to identify the crystallographic direction corresponding to the long axis of the needle-like crystals such as the ones observed with an on-axis optical microscope installed at the ID13 beamline of the ESRF (Fig.  The crystallographic direction corresponding to the long axis of the crystal can be determined as follows. Firstly, the two strongest in-plane (hk0) re\ue104ections are indexed to ( 350) and (  For both columnar-nematic and crystalline solid states, the molecular piling direction is thus oriented parallel to the substrate and should support in-plane charge transport. On the other hand, for out-of-plane charge transport, the hopping pathways between adjacent molecular stacks are most important. In conventional molecular semiconductors that selfassemble into lamellar or columnar structures, the molecular stacks are generally separated by interlayers of alkyl chains that hinder charge transport perpendicular to the stacking direction. In contrast, for TPD C8 -TAT C8 in the columnar-nematic phase, the molecules bridging neighboring columns should support such a transport (as illustrated in Fig.  Space-charge limited current devices provide a convenient and well-established way to study charge transport in semiconducting thin \ue103lms perpendicular to the substrate and is also the method we have chosen to investigate out-of-plane charge transport in TPD C8 -TAT C8 thin \ue103lms.  Controlling the semiconductor thickness is crucially important for SCLC measurements, since the current density scales as L \u00c03 . Surface roughness can lead to a signi\ue103cant overestimation of the hole mobility, as shown by numerical simulations in the ESI (Fig.  The measurements were performed at room temperature in either the glassy nematic state or the crystalline state. Representative room-temperature current density-voltage curves measured in both solid states and both device architectures are plotted in Fig.  p o is determined by carrier in-diffusion from contacts and decreases with increasing L.  To estimate the hole mobility, we \ue103tted the J(V) curves to the following equation:  where the \ue103rst term corresponds to Ohm's law and the second to Mott-Gurney's law. A \ue103eld independent mobility (m h ) and p o are used as \ue103tting parameters. The dielectric constant (3 r ) was estimated to 3.0 from the geometric capacitance of a standard SCLC device. The relevance to compare SCLC data to a sum of both laws has been recently discussed by Jason A. R\u00f6hr  The results obtained on standard devices agree well with eqn (1) (Fig.  The results obtained on thick devices, for both solid states, follow closely, but not fully, eqn (1) (Fig.  We further evaluated the quality of charge transport in both solid states by measuring the SCLC mobility as a function of temperature (Fig.  where E a is the activation energy for charge carrier hopping, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature and m N a pre-factor (Fig.  We \ue103nally assessed in-plane charge transport in both, nematic and crystalline states, by measuring the hole mobility in top-contact-bottom-gate organic \ue103eld-effect transistors  (OFET) with channel widths varying between 60 and 90 mm. For the nematic state, the as-deposited \ue103lm was annealed for 5 seconds into the isotropic phase (180 C) followed by natural cooling to room temperature, while for the crystalline state, the \ue103lm was annealed at 145 C for 40 minutes to obtain a uniform distribution of relatively small crystalline needles (Fig.  For the crystalline state, high contact resistances led unfortunately to strongly non-linear transfer characteristics and allowed only a rough estimate of the \ue103eld-effect mobility in the saturation regime. The latter was found to be approximately 3 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 cm 2 V \u00c01 s \u00c01 (Table  Overall, the mobility data extracted from SCLC and OFET measurements, summarized in Table  Film deposition and thermal processing: Thin \ue103lms were deposited on top of different substrates (i.e. Si\/SiO 2 , glass\/ITO\/ PEDOT: PSS or Si 3 N 4 ) by spin coating an anhydrous chloroform (>99%) solution of TPD C8 -TAT C8 in N 2 atmosphere. Different annealing steps were applied under nitrogen ambient to achieve desired solid states: (a) Nematic state: annealing at 180 C for 5 seconds (isotropic phase), followed by rapid cooling to room temperature. (b) Crystalline state (small crystals): annealing at 100 C for 5 minutes, followed by 120 C for 5 minutes and 145 C for 40 minutes (cold crystallization). The gradual increase in temperature is used to avoid \ue103lm de-wetting. (c) Crystalline state (large crystals): annealing at 180 C for 5 minutes, followed by rapid cooling to room temperature and subsequent heating to 145 C for 40 minutes. The standard device structure used for hole mobility measurements is shown in Scheme S1. \u2020 The Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were \ue103rst cleaned in soapsuds, deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol at 45 C for 15 minutes and treated by UV-ozone for 30 minutes. Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated on top of the ITO (5000 rpm for 60 s), dried at 140 C for 30 minutes in N 2 atmosphere and used as hole injection electrode. A 20 mg mL \u00c01 chloroform solution of TPD C8 -TAT C8 was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer under nitrogen ambient. Different thicknesses were achieved using different spin speeds (typically, 1500 rpm for 60 s leads to a 250 nm thick layer). Lastly, 7 nm thick MoO 3 and 120 nm thick Ag layers were deposited by physical vapor deposition on top of the active layer under vacuum (<10 \u00c06 mbar). The electrode surface area varied between 1.0 mm 2 , and 2.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 mm 2 . The small device areas were necessary to avoid the compliance of the measurement equipment for high mobility samples. Thick devices were manufactured by \ue103rst structuring the ITO layers with acid etching into an array of parallel, 1 mm wide, ITO stripes. Both glass\/ITO substrates were coated by PEDOT:PSS and used as building block for the \ue103nal device (Scheme S2 \u2020). A suitable amount of molecular powder (0.5-3 mg) was accurately weighted (to the nearest one-hundredth of a mg) and was deposited on the center of one structured glass\/ ITO substrate. Several spacers (8, 20, 28 mm thick) were added on the four corners in order to de\ue103ne the approximate \ue103nal active layer thickness. The second ITO-glass substrate was put on top of the molecular powder with the electrodes being perpendicularly oriented with respect to the ITO strips of the bottom substrate. The sample was then heated above the isotropic transition temperature (180 C) for several minutes under mechanical compression. Being in the liquid state, the molecules were able to spread over the device area, while a mechanical pressure was constantly and evenly applied over the entire surface of the cell. A\ue09der cooling to room temperature, the samples were eventually annealed again at 145 C for 40 minutes to form the crystalline phase. The \ue103nal device thickness L of the active layer was estimated by taking into account the mass m of the organic materials deposited on the \ue103rst substrate and the area S occupied by the organic materials as evaluated from the micrograph (red area of Scheme S2d, \u2020 according to L \u00bc m\/(rS) and assuming a volume density r of 1.0 mg cm \u00c03 . The individual diode area was \ue103xed to 1 mm 2 . For each sample, approximately 4 individual diodes could be characterized. Bottom-contact-bottom gate transistors were fabricated using commercially available Si\/SiO 2 substrates with lithographically de\ue103ned source and drain contacts. The latter were composed of ITO (10 nm)\/Au (30 nm) bilayers de\ue103ning a channel length of 2.5 mm and channel width of 1.0 cm. The 230 nm thick SiO 2 layer was used as a gate dielectric. The substrates were cleaned in soapsuds, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and subsequently for 30 minutes in an UV-ozone system. A 5 mg ml \u00c01 concentrated anhydrous chloroform solutions of TPD C8 -TAT C8 were spincoated (1500 rpm for 60 s) in N 2 ambient. Top-contact-bottom gate transistors were fabricated using a silicon substrate with a 200 nm thermal silicon oxide (SiO 2 ) layer as gate dielectric. The substrates were cleaned in soapsuds, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and subsequently for 30 minutes in an UV-ozone system. A 5 mg ml \u00c01 concentrated anhydrous chloroform solutions of TPD C8 -TAT C8 were spincoated (1500 rpm for 60 s) in nitrogen ambient. The top electrodes (7 nm MoO 3 and 120 nm Ag) were thermal evaporated on top of the active layer under secondary vacuum (<10 \u00c06 mbar). SCLC and OFET devices were characterized in nitrogen ambient using a probe station and a Keithley 4200 semiconductor analyzer. A Peltier thermo-module was used for temperature dependent SCLC measurements. The SCLC devices were placed directly on top of the Peltier module. The temperature was measured by a RTD Pt100 sensor and varied between 263 K to 323 K. The \ue103eld-effect hole mobility was calculated by \ue103tting the measured transfer curves in the saturation regime to the standard transistor model.  The nematic state thin \ue103lm thickness was measured using a Bruker Dektak pro\ue103lometer with a scan speed of 10 mm s \u00c01 , lateral resolution of 0.6 mm, and stylus force 1.0 mg. The crystalline state thin \ue103lm thickness and roughness was measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed with a TA Instruments Q1000 instrument, operated at a scanning rate of 5 C min \u00c01 on heating and on cooling Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) GIWAXS measurements were conducted at PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Korea. The X-rays coming from the vacuum undulator (IVU) were monochromated using Si (111) double crystals and focused on the detector using K-B type mirrors. Patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165). The sample-to-detector distance was about 222 mm for energy of 11.07 keV (1.120 \u00c5). Microfocus X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the ID13 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). For the measurements spin-coated \ue103lms of TPDC8-TATC8 were crystallized on a 1 mm thick suspended Si 3 N 4 window from Silson Ltd. (UK). The region of interest on a membrane was identi\ue103ed with an on-axis optical microscope. The X-ray diffraction measurements were performed with a photon energy of 13 keV (0.9537 \u00c5) at a sample-todetector distance of (155.96 AE 0.02) mm. The footprint of the Xray beam was 2.5 \u00c2 2.5 mm 2 . The sample was \ue103xed on a piezo translation stage, which in turn was placed on a hexapod stage for coarse movements. The sample was 2D scanned with a step of 1 mm along both coordinates. The resulting 2D diffractograms were centered, geometrically corrected and calibrated using a corundum standard. In summary, we have explored the solid-state structure and hole transport in a donor-acceptor-donor type planar dumbbellshaped molecular semiconductor comprising two triazatruxene (TAT) end units and a central thiophenethienopyrroledione-thiophene (TPD) unit. The results reveal that these molecules self-assemble into either an uncommon bridged hexagonal columnar nematic liquid crystalline phase or a daughter, crystalline phase, depending on the thermal history. The (hk0) peaks of the crystalline phase could be indexed to an oblique unit cell, which is equivalent to a slightly deformed hexagonal lattice, suggesting that the observed crystalline phase stems from the parent hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase. Both phases exhibit a molecular stacking direction lying in plane and oriented perpendicular to the molecular axes. The conjugated segments connecting two TAT units then act as intercolumnar conjugated bridges and are at the origin of unique charge transport properties. Charge transfer is indeed no longer limited to intermolecular hopping along one-dimensional columnar stacks, as usually observed in other single TATderivatives or discotic molecules, but becomes effective in 3D. In the mesophase, the out-of-plane hole transport was estimated by SCLC to be about 10 \u00c03 cm 2 V \u00c01 s \u00c01 , slightly above the \ue103eld-effect in-plane mobility. On the other hand, an outstandingly high out-of-plane SCLC mobility of 0.17 cm 2 V \u00c01 s \u00c01 , in combination with a low activation energy of 30 meV, was measured in the crystalline phase. Although only a lower limit of 0.05 cm 2 V \u00c01 s \u00c01 could be obtained so far for the in-plane \ue103eld-effect mobility, the results support the conclusion that the molecular assembly allows for efficient charge transport perpendicular as well as parallel to the molecular stacking direction. Overall, our observations suggest that the two highly planar TAT end-groups are effectively driving the molecules into a unique 3D conducting bridged columnar phase, wherein the molecules are bridging adjacent columns or molecular stacks through the insulating aliphatic domains. As a consequence, 3D charge-transport with a low degree of anisotropy, a feature rarely observed in solution processable crystalline small molecules, could be demonstrated.

Analysis of the fine structures of Ph x LPC or Pyr x LPC monolayers at 30 mN\/m probed with XRR The fine structures perpendicular to the plane of Ph x LPC and Pyr x LPC monolayers were studied using XRR. A monolayer of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), a phospholipid with similar polar headgroup (i.e., choline headgroup) and alkyl chain length (16 carbons), was compressed to 30 mN\/m and characterized by XRR for the sake of comparison. Figures  To investigate if the Pyro-a and Pyr x LPC compounds form crystalline domains at the air\/water interface as revealed by AFM data and to determine their size and shape parameters, we studied the in plane structures of the monolayer using GISAXS. The GISAXS data suggests that pure monolayers made of Pyro-a or PyrxLPC form crystalline domains at the air\/water interface (Figure  The allocated beam time allowed us to systematically investigate the fine structures of lipidporphyrin conjugates monolayers in the absence or presence of other phospholipids such as DPPC. Our XRR data revealed that the Pl-Por did not show an alignment between the two chains upon their compression. However the porphyrin core remains at the air\/water interface. This would have a great impact on their supramolecular assembly when suspended in aqueous media. 10.1016\/j.jcis.2021.12.114). Further detailed analysis of the GISAXS results are undergoing to get quantitative data on the in-plane structures and will be published soon. -0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 0,1 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 1E7 1E8 1E9 1E10 Int.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Worm-like micelle solutions will be measured in a high-shear capillary rheometer to better understand the microstructural alignment, breakdown, and shear thinning rheology. Our capillary rheometer, previously developed for neutron scattering [1], was modified to expand the accessible shear rates up to 10^7 s-1 when using high-flux X-ray sources. A non-monotonic change in micelle alignment [1] is hypothesized to occur from breakage of the micelles into shorter lengths at high shear rates. The USAXS 2D detector will enable measurement of both the micelle lengths (100-10000 nm) and orientation distribution of micelle radii (10 nm) as a function of shear rate and concentration. To our knowledge, such measurements are only possible at ID02 USAXS. If desirable, we are eager to share knowledge and rheometer design with others at the ESRF, further improving the rheometer for future users aiming to measure the rheology and nanostructure of complex fluids at high shear rates.

We have previously developed conductive screen printing inks through the gelation of graphene-polymer dispersions.

Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we aim at mapping the effects of synthesis parameters on the dimensions of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) at low concentrations, and the effects of polymeric stabilizers on the shape and interactions of GNPs at higher concentrations. Furthermore, we aim to study the synthesis of graphene over time.

Several additives (ethyl cellulose, sodium deoxycholate) were added in varying concentrations to study the effect of additives on the GNP colloidal interactions. All samples were brought to ID02 in quartz capillaries for the efficient measurement of a high number of samples. In addition, a series of dispersions with several additive concentrations were sedimented in situ to quantify their colloidal stability. Furthermore, several dispersions were heated in situ to investigate temperature-induced morphological changes. We investigated the production process of GNP through intercalation and thermal expansion of raw graphite  To investigate the colloidal stability of GNP dispersions in ethanol with varying additive (ethyl cellulose) concentrations, we let our samples sediment inside the capillary overnight. After sedimentation, the scattered intensity at the top of the capillary increased with ethyl cellulose concentration, indicating a decrease in sedimentation rate (Figure  We produce graphene nanoplatelets via high-shear exfoliation of expanded graphite. This produces nanoplatelets with a range of thicknesses depending on the exfoliation conditions. To investigate the thickness distributions, we fitted a form factor for lamellar disks to the SAXS pattern. The procedure is illustrated in Figure  Further work Full analysis of the dataset (>500 GB) is in progress. We are particularly interested in the effect of exfoliation conditions on GNP thickness, in the effect of stabilizers on interplatelet interactions expressed in the structure factor and the form factor (e.g. GNP thickness), in nematic structure formation during sedimentation and in changes in the platelet network during heat ramps.",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Many biological systems evolved unique ways to assemble multi-hierarchical structures with functions ranging from sensing to light manipulation. To harvest the full potential of the bio-inspired structures it is important to understand the underlying processes of their formation in biological systems. We will study topological textures in multi-hierarchical photonic structures of butterflies to understand their role and mechanism of their formation. We aim to acquire high-resolution tomograms of naturally grown gyroidal and ridge-like photonic networks (ca. 300-500 nm unit cells) and their domains (10-20 microns). We will use the acquired data to: (1) perform Landau phase-field modelling to understand whether the topologies are emergent or induced by the organisms; and (2) simulate the photonic properties of the topological textures to understand whether they are coherent with surrounding structures or carry their unique optical signatures. Biological systems evolved unique ways to assemble multi-hierarchical structures with functions ranging from sensing to light manipulation  To harvest the full potential of the bio-inspired structures it is important to understand the underlying processes of their formation in biological systems. The butterflies stand out among other species for the diversity of structure types that they exhibit, starting with ridges, honeycombs, and lamellae, and culminating with structures as exotic as gyroid bio-photonic crystals  Recently we performed imaging of synthetic diamond morphologies  Thus, we propose to use X-ray nano tomography to understand the role of topological defects in multihierarchical structures of butterflies. We will use acquired high resolution volumetric data to:  The ID16A beamline provides a unique opportunity for multiscale bioimaging due to its small beam size (down to 25nm), high energy of the X-rays (17.1 keV used in this experiment), and cryogenic sample environment that allows to mediate radiation damage induced by X-rays. The beamline also allows to perform phase contrast imaging with two powerful techniques: holographic X-ray imaging (HXI) and near-field X-ray ptychography (NFP). In the current experiment, we achieved an important milestone for the high-resolution X-ray imaging of biophotonic structures by investigating the advantages of the two techniques and their limitations. We also explored approaches to enhance the contrast by sputtering the photonic structures of butterflies with a thin layer of gold (~20nm). We have successfully imaged photonic structures in Thecla opisena (butterfly) and Eupholus Schoenherri Petiti (beetle). Both samples exhibit nanoscale photonic structures yet show different responses to the high dose of the X-rays. The beetle sample is naturally less radiation sensitive as its photonic structures are part of the protective layer with higher mechanical strength compared to the lightweight butterfly scales. Performing imaging experiments on the beetle sample allowed us to optimize the acquisition parameters, compare imaging techniques, and obtain high-resolution data on nanoscale photonic networks confined by both top and bottom surfaces. The outcome of this methodological part of the experiment was to optimize sample preparation, push the pixel size down to 3nm, establish the reconstruction pipeline, and develop domain orientation analysis tools.

Recent results indicate the presence of peculiar intermediate range structures that appear to be correlated with the glass formation process.

Depending on the inter-particle interactions these states are typically associated to a gel (attractive) or glass (repulsive) phase  The experiment was performed at ID02 with 12keV in USAXS configuration. we measured samples that are able to change reversibly the interparticle potential, thus capable to switch between an arrested glass and an arrested gel structure. More in detail the samples were nanoparticles composed by a silica core and a PNIPAm shell. In total we measured 6 different samples at 4 different volume fractions ( plus diluted samples for the form factor). We carried out our measurements at 6 different temperatures ranging from 20 \u00b0C to 45 \u00b0C to observe the transition between the glasssy state (swollen PNIPAm shell) to the gel state (collapsed PNIPAm shell). We collected an XPCS measurement for each temperature to control the dynamical condition of the sample and we collected speckle patterns from all the capillary volume to obtain information of the intermediate range order via XCCA analysis.

    "title":"Shear thinning and shear thickening in colloidal suspensions",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"shear thinning and shear thickening are two phenoma commonly observed when colloidal suspensions flow. Shear thinning corresponds to a decrease of the viscosity as the shear rate increases while shear thickening corresponds to an increase of the viscosity as the shear rate increases. Here, we will use a dispersion of carbon black particles (fractal colloidal particles of diameter 70nm) in oil to study the shear thinning effect and a dispersion of fumed silica particles (fractal colloidal particles of diameter 300nm) dispersed in Polypropylene glycol. Time Resolved Ultra Small Angle X-ray Scattering coupled to rheology will be used to monitor the structure of the dispersion along its flow curve. Decreasing the shear rate in shear thinning carbon black dispersions should lead to larger and larger clusters while we believe that it is the contrary in shear thickening fumed silica dispersions. When attractive forces are present, colloidal suspensions are unstable and aggregate into \"floc\" or \"clusters\"  The structural changes may occur over a broad range of length scales, ranging from colloid particles to percolated networks. In the limit of strong colloid attraction and low volume fraction, fractal approaches have been widely used to relate the structure and the rheology of suspensions, either in the liquid or gel state, and numerous models can be found in the literature  In the present study, rheometric tests coupled with small angle scattering (SAXS) experiments were conducted on CB suspensions in mineral oil, as reported in  suspensions during flow step down tests  Flow step down tests have been performed on 8 % (w\/w) CB suspension from an initial shear rate \u03b3 = 500 s -1 down to \u03b30 = 100, 10, 1 and 0.5 s -1 (Figure  For \u03b30 = 100 s -1 a steady state was rapidly reached (Figure  Using the setup reported  Flow curves measurements are standard rheological tests to assess the stress dependence of suspensions over a broad range of shear rate and to determine the dynamic yield stress.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"In this project, we propose to investigate the in-situ self-organization of lead halide CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered structures upon controlled solvent evaporation using simultaneous SAXS\/WAXS measurements. A dedicated sample environment will be used for the evaporative assembly, which was demonstrated to be successful in our previous experiment at the ESRF, ID02. Besides studying of the assembly kinetics, we expect to investigate the role of the (i) size\/shape, (ii) dispersion medium and (iii) surface ligand coverage on the self-assembly process. The underlying nanocrystals micro-structural packing details within perovskite NCs solution govern their macro-properties (i.e., carrier lifetime and lasing); the current proposal aims to bridge this gap in understanding to improve photonic properties. the controlled experimental conditions allowed for monitoring of the slightest changes in the superlattice states. The experimental parameters of the beamline were as follows. The energy of the incident X-ray beam was set to 12.23 keV and the beam size was 25 x 25 \u00b5m 2 . The SAXS data were recorded by the Eiger2 4M detector at the sample-to-detector distance of 1.52 m. Images were collected with exposure times of 0.2 -0.5 seconds. For the chosen exposure times no beam damage of the sample was observed. Monodisperse lead halide perovskite NCs were produced at the KU Leuven by a hot-injection method at different sizes in the range of 4-30 nm in diameter and stabilized by oleic acid \/ oleylamine ligands. We studied the effect of the NC chemical composition (CsPbCl 3, CsPbBr 3, CsPbI 3 ), size, solvent (heptane and toluene) as well as shape (cubic or hexagonal particles) on the self-assembly outcome during the provided beamtime. The representative SAXS data revealing a transition from the colloidal suspension into the NC superlattice state -visible by the appearance of Bragg reflections -as a function of evaporation time are shown in Figure ",

The measurements will yield access into both the ultrastructure and the stability of AOCs, thus allowing for structure-stability correlations.

In this experiment, we determined the structure and stability of concentrated albumin-derived artificial oxygen carriers (A-AOC) in aqueous suspension, by combined ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) and SAXS measurements. Utilizing the versatility of ESRF's ID02 beamline (variable sample-detector-distance of up to 31m; high photon flux), structural information from the micron to the nanometre range in aqueous environment have been accessible from medical relevant A-AOC suspensions over a broad concentration range. In detail, data collection on aqueuous suspensions of A-AOCs was performed at several sample-detector distances (1 m; 8 m; 31 m), yielding in total an accessible q-range from 0.002 nm -1 to 7.5 nm -1 (covering a length scale range from 0.8 to 3000 nm). Scattering data were collected of A-AOCs from different synthesis approaches: Ultra-sound-assisted and microfluidizer-assisted  Noteworthy, the contribution of unbound albumin is clearly visible from Fig.  Analysis of the USAXS profiles yields access to the particle size distribution (Fig.  As demonstrated, our USAXS measurements yielded access into both the ultrastructure and the stability of A-AOCs. Clearly, our different synthesis approaches lead to particle of different sizes and stability, as probed over a wide concentration and temperature range. Based on the (ongoing) data analysis, structure-stability correlations will be determined. These findings will promote the fine-tuning of our AOCsynthesis approaches. We plan publish the experimental USAXS results within upcoming articles describing in detail the synthesis, structure, and stability of A-AOCs. The data will be also presented at the XVIII SAS2022 conference in Campinas and at Europhysiology 2022 in Copenhagen.  ",

    "title":"High resolution X-ray tensor tomography to study the spiral nanostructure of narwhal tusk",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Narwhals are mysterious animals whose tusk has a unique spiral structure with highly anisotropic mechanical properties. We hypothesize that the orientation of the biological nanostructure reflects the spiral macro-structure, which defines their mechanical properties. Previous experiments showed important aligned structures in the micrometric range however the achievable resolution was not enough to fully resolve them. Therefore, we propose to use SWAXS to study the orientation and degree of anisotropy of the biomineral nanoparticles in the tusk in 2D and 3D. Examining samples from dentine and cementum will reveal the unique structure and shed light on its formation process. The 3D hierarchical structure will be very valuable for micromechanical modelling of anisotropic composites, which will bring new knowledge on composite materials with complex architectures and inspire new material designs. The aim of the experiment was to analyse the orientation and spatial distribution of the collagen and mineral platelets in narwhal tusk with micro resolution, with the final goal of connecting the nanostructure of such tissue with the macroscopic helicoidal structure. We hypothesize that the orientational arrangement of collagen fibrils and biomineral nanocrystals is directly related to the spiral nature of the tusk and its mechanical properties. Thereby its determination is an essential piece of the spiral puzzle of narwhal tusks. Previous experiment revealed an important relationship between the orientation of the nanostructure at different positions in the tusk and the macroscopic spiral shape; however, a microbeam is necessary to achieve higher resolution and fully resolve the nanostructure in the three-dimensional space. High-resolution small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography (S\/WASTT) was done at the microfocus beamline (ID13) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, France). An X-ray beam of 13.0 keV was produced using a channel-cut Si(111) monochromator and focused to 3\u00d73 \u00b5m 2 using a pair of Pt-coated fixed elliptical Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors (KB) and a set of beryllium compound refractive lenses. A small flight tube filled with He was placed between the sample and the detector to minimise air absorption and scattering after which there was a small beamstop to block the direct beam. The scattering signal was recorded using an Eiger X 4M detector (Dectris AG, Switzerland) placed downstream from the flight tube. The 3D samples were prepared on PMMA pins to minimise X-ray absorption and in a dual-axis goniometer that allows for rotation (\u03b1) around a tomography axis, tilt perpendicular to the tomographic axis (\u03b2), and scanning in the xy plane  The reciprocal space map of the scattering signal corresponding to the mineral particles (q = 0.36 -2.25 nm -1 ) was reconstructed using SAXS tensor tomography with a cubic voxel size of 3 \u00b5m. The sample was obtained from a segment in the upper half of the tusk (14 -28 cm from the tusk tip) containing cementum and dentine. Previous experiments indicated a reciprocal space map with multiple orientations per voxel. For that reason, higher resolution SASTT was done reducing the voxel size from 25 \u00b5m to 3 \u00b5m (Figure  A manuscript is under preparation, containing the results of the experiment as well as previous results using 2D scattering and birefringence microscopy.

    "title":"Dynamics of vesicles in dense pools studied by XPCS",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We propose to study the dynamics of synaptic vesicles (SV) [1] and of artificial lipid vesicles in dense vesicle pools by XPCS. Pools are aggregates of vesicles which are clustered together by proteins causing an attractive interaction. We target  in particular the short range (hindered) diffusion of vesicles which are believed to be at least partially arrested in the pool. Center-of-mass movements as well as relaxation of deformations and viscoelastic strain fields in the pool are expected to contribute to the XPCS signal, and will be disentangled via the q-dependence and by varying the sample setup (density, SV versus simple vesicles, protein concentration etc.). Here we extend our previous SAXS study of SV pools (SC-5112) by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) using highly brilliant ESRF undulator radiation. We want to understand how a vesicle diffuses within a dense cluster which is formed by gel-like interaction with specific proteins, notably synapsin. XPCS scattering data was recorded with an Eiger500k detector positioned 7 m downstream from the sample, located in a quartz capillary (1 mm diameter). The 8.09 keV beam was collimated to a beam size of about 40x40 \u00b5m\u00b2. As in our experiments assessing the static structure of synapsin clusters (e.g. at ID02, SC-5112 and  Single XPCS runs usually comprised 4,000 diffraction images taken successively at exposure times of 5, 25, and 100 ms at different attenuator values, adjusted to minimise beam damage to the sample (0-3 silicon attenuators, 80 \u00b5m thick). At beam intensities that were strong enough to achieve good correlation signals, beam damage was usually visible. To limit the influence of beam induced changes and assuming a homogenous sample, multiple XPCS runs were carried out at different positions along the capillary and individual correlation signals were later averaged to find a mean correlation function. This simple setup, however, did not yield the desired results, due to either low signal strength or strong beam induced effects. To increase signal strength, we decided to measure the correlation of passive tracer particles (DUKE silica colloids, 490 nm diameter, 2.05 %CV) suspended in the sample solutions. Using this passive XPCS microrheology approach, the static SAXS signal was dominated by the DUKE tracer particles. This made measurements at a much lower dose possible, but some beamdamage was still observable in the averaged intensity, especially near the minima of the silica particles. Results showing the amount of beam damage to a calcium and synapsin sample at different dose rates (0.27 kGy\/s and 0.82 kGy\/s, resp.) are shown in Fig. ",

    "title":"Geometric frustration controlled morphogenesis of protein crystals",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Solid assemblies of organic compounds often include some inevitable misfit between constituents, giving rise to geometric frustration. In order to fit into the assembly the molecular building blocks must distort. In many cases, for small enough assemblies there are non-local compromises that are more energetically favourable. These are associated with non-uniform distortions and highly cooperative response between the constituents. This may result in tendency to form filaments, lattice distortions and large morphological variations during the growth of the assembly. In the proposed experiment, we will follow the morphological evolution and branching of slender protein single crystals formed by a living organism. This will not only provide the first experimental evidence to geometric frustration in protein crystals, but will also demonstrate the role of spontaneous processes in biological tissue formation. We aim to provide a toolkit for controlled branching of macromolecular crystals.  fraction of slender organic compounds could form twisted molecular crystals. Whenever the constituents of an assembly are required to distort in order to be joined together, their assembly is associated with geometric frustration. In the case the effect is cumulative, the frustration builds up and leads to a progressive twist of the crystal lattice and other elastic phenomena.  The holotomographic imaging method on the beamline ID16A-NI was used to study the evolution of the chrystal habbit of the eaxial filament. The exceptionally small beam and the resulting nanometer-sized resolution matched well the small diameter of the axial filament the shape of which needed to be resolved. We succesfully followed the morphological evolution of symmetrically branched spicules in three Demosponge species: Stryphnus ponderous, Geodia cydonium and Tethia aurantium. The imaging beamline ID16A made it possible to perform zoom-projected imaging that can be combined into phase-retrieved holotomographic reconstructions of small samples. The high flux, high resolution, dedicated software and our experience on ID16A provided unprecedented 3D reconstructions of the morphology of protein crystals produced by living organisms. A total of 24 spicules collected from the three organisms were investigated. \"Low\" resolution overview holotomography scans followed by a number of local-tomography using the higher resolutions of the experimental setup of 30 nm at 17 KeV and 0.3 s exposure time were performed. The local scans were used to image the crystal habit of the axial filament at different regions of the spicule. The holotomographic datasets were phase retrieved to quantify local structural variations in density and reconstructed to create 3D information on the protein crystal. Finally, the different scans were merged to provide comprehensive information of the shape of the axil filament during its formation. The information presented in Figure ",

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The glass transition is an out of equilibrium transition from the fluid to a disordered solid obtained at very high volume fractions. The glass transition is a dynamical arrested transition where colloids are trapped within the cage formed by their neighbors. The absence of rearrangement on long time scales leads to the solid behavior of the suspension. This transition has been well studied for hard-sphere colloids. Here, we aim to study this transition for fractal colloids, namely fumed silica dispersed in a good solvent. Preliminary results show that this system presents two originalities compared to hard-sphere colloidal systems. As the volume fraction is increased, the system viscosity diverges at low volume fraction, 30% and the colloids interpenetrate each other. Using SAXS and XPCS, we will systematically explore the structure and dynamics of fumed silica dispersion as a function of their volume fraction. We aim to unravel the role of interpenetration in glass forming liquids. The glass transition is an out of equilibrium transition from the fluid to a disordered solid obtained at very high volume fractions. The glass transition is a dynamical arrested transition where colloids are trapped within the cage formed by their neighbors. The absence of rearrangement on long time scales leads to the solid behavior of the suspension. This transition has been well studied for hard-sphere colloids with experiments on model colloids  Please find below a first draft of the analysis of the data. This is work in progress. There are still plenty of analysis to carry out. Fumed silica particles come from the silicon tetrachloride pyrolysis. The fumed-silica particles are composed of nodules of a few nanometers that are fused together permanently during the flame synthesis and form aggregates of a few hundreds of manometers  We designed the system so that the fumed silica dispersion is quasi entropic and that the sole control parameter is the volume fraction \u03d5. To this end, we have index matched the dispersion to annihilate the van der Waals interactions: the index of refraction of the water glycerol mixture n wg = xxx and the one of fumed silica is n f s = xxx. To check the entropic nature of the system, we have checked the properties of the system varying the temperature and the addition of sodium chloride. Both parameters displays mild change on the system properties as reported in the appendix IV We have prepared suspensions at various volume fractions \u03d5 by varying the mass concentration c: \u03d5 =  we used a rheometer to measure the mechanical properties of fumed silica dispersion. We carried out our experiments with the stress-controlled rheometers MCR301 (Anton Paar) equipped with a rough cone (radius 40 mm, angle 1 \u2022 ) and a smooth rough plate both made of steel. We performed flow curves and oscillatory tests. The flow curve were obtained by increasing the stress from \u03c3 = 0.1 Pa up to a few hundreds or few thousand pascal depending on the sample and measuring the resulting shear rate \u03b3 or viscosity \u03b7. The oscillatory tests were carried out at f = 0.1 Hz with increasing strain amplitude \u03b3 and we retrieved the stress and the real part of the complex viscosity \u03b7 \u2032 . In such conditions, both method give identical flow curves: \u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7 = f unct(\u03c3). William could you please rewrite this section The microstructural and dynamical properties of the fumed silica dispersion are investigated using XPCS and SAXS on the ID02 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) [? ]. The samples were injected is borosilica capillary (WJM xxx) of diameter 1.5mm. The incident X-ray beam of wavelength xxx 0.1 nm is collimated to a vertical size of 50 \u00b5m and a horizontal size of 100 \u00b5m. The 2D scattering patterns were measured using an Eiger2 4M pixel array detector and the subsequent data reduction procedure is described elsewhere [? ]. The scattering intensity I(q) is obtained by subtracting the two-dimensional scattering patterns of the fumed silica dispersion and the background solvent. The resulting scattering intensity presented in this article always remained isotropic. Therefore, we radially averaged the normalized intensity pattern to obtain one dimensional I(q). xpcs setup xxx XPCS experiments, sequential acquisitions from the same sample spot are measured, so that the intermediate scattering function g 1 (q, \u2206t) (ISF) can be calculated from the scattered intensity I( -\u2192 q ) as g 2 (q, \u2206t) = \u27e8I( -\u2192 q , t)I( -\u2192 q , t + \u2206t)\u27e9 \/ \u27e8I( -\u2192 q )\u27e9 = 1 + \u03b2g 1 (q, \u2206t) 2 . \u03b2 is the speckle contrast. The time delay between two consecutive time frames is denoted \u2206t and \u27e8. . . \u27e9 is the ensemble average over all equivalent delay times t and pixels within a certain range of the absolute value of q. We probed the properties of the ISF by acquiring movies at different frame rate and stitching the g 2 (q, \u2206t) so that \u2206t ranges from 1 ms to 10000 s. The form factor I F F (q) of fumed silica AE300 was measured at c = 0.3% w and is displayed in Fig.  . (1) This model yields a = 117 nm, D m = 2.3, a 0 = 4.5 nm and D s = 2.2. This model assumed that the primary particles and the cluster are monodisperse. This is not the case. ToDo: \u2192 Take into account the polydispersity \u2192 Remake some TEM images and get some pdf of the size The fumed silica dispersion show a peculiar rheological behavior. In Fig.  (2) We find \u03d5 g = 0.25 and \u03bd = 6. As compared to hard sphere dispersion where \u03d5 g = 0.58 and \u03bd = 2 [8? ], fumed silica dispersion form glass at much lower volume fraction and the diverging regime is much stiffer. ToDo: \u2192 viscosity measurements seem to cleaners in oscillatory modes at f = 0.1Hz. check and redo. The scattering intensity I(q) normalized by the volume fraction \u03d5 of the fumed silica dispersions in quiescent conditions is displayed in Fig.  As shown in Fig.  ToDo: \u2192 Would it be useful to measure I(q) at larger q to check if S(q) really show to structure peak? \u2192 understand the sharp increase of neighbour distance in Fig.  In our preliminary analysis, we focused on two volume fractions: \u03d5 = 0.03 and \u03d5 = 0.132 The dynamics is obtained by XPCS and is shown in Fig.  The stretch exponential allow us to consider a rate distribution with an average rate of In Fig.  In Fig.  The way we fit g 2 has consequences on the value of \u27e8\u0393 i \u27e9.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"The aim of this project is to develop multilayered cellulosic-based composites with structural organization pertaining to cartilage tissue engineering. Recently, frontal ultrafiltration (FU) under ultrasounds (US) processing applied on nanocrystal celluloses (CNCs) aqueous suspensions, have allowed to achieve the three orthotropic structured layers representatives of the multizonal material cartilage. In-situ SAXS revealed a parallel orientation of the CNCs near the membrane surface, an intermediate isotropic layer and a vertical orientation layer of the CNCs near the ultrasonic vibrating blade. The goal of this proposal is firstly, to freeze this structural organization thanks to the mixing of CNCS with UV cured polymer and in-situ photopolymerization applied at the end of the builded multilayered organization, secondly bring an understanding of the organization mechanism induces during FU\/US\/UVcuring processing from nanometric to micrometric length scales by in-situ SAXS and USAXS. The focus of this project is to study in-situ the combined effect of shear flow, pressure and ultrasound waves on the structural organization of colloidal suspensions with the aim of developing novel tunable nano-to micro-structured materials. Accessing a wide range of length scales, subnanometric to a few micrometers will shed light on the orientation mechanisms and structural organizations induced by the relative intensity of these external forces. Recently, we were able to evidence the ability of the ultrafiltration processes to develop well-defined layered structures of anisometric colloidal particles aligned horizontally along the velocity direction from nanometer to micrometer length scales  The goal of this proposal was firstly to use in-situ SAXS, to bring an understanding of the organization mechanism induces during FU\/US-UV curing processing and secondly, to characterize solid cellulosic UV cured nanocomposites after different FU\/US conditions. A dedicated SAXS channel-type ultrafiltration\/ultrasound cell was implemented at ID02 to simultaneously generate an US-induced vertical acoustic radiation force at the top of the channel and simultaneously a transmembrane pressure force at the bottom of the channel near the membrane surface. The SAXS patterns where regularly registered as a function of the distance z from the membrane surface and as a function of FU\/US time processing. Different US Power were explored at two different initial CNCs concentrations. Thanks to this set-up and in situ SAXS, and according to first experiment on precedent run SC-5110, the typical multilayered orthotropic structuring that mimic the articular cartilage organization was confirmed for two different CNCs initial concentrations and for different ultrasound acoustic powers from 20 to 100 %. In this run, the ultrasound power was modified and we explored the effect of this US acoustic power on the organization and thickness of the three differently structured zones. By using the values of the PCA anisotropy parameter (calculated using principal component analysis (PCA) in SASET software) for different US power conditions, it was possible to determine the thickness of each of the different oriented layers (Fig.  Second result: in-situ characterization of the solid CNC\/PEGDA nanocomposites obtained by FU\/US followed by UV curing process. First evidence of ability to freeze the three-layered mimicking the cartilage organization. A second experiment was carried out using light-cured solid nanocomposites (PEGDA\/CNC) previously prepared in the laboratory. Precise scans were taken at 25 \u00b5m intervals within these nanocomposites. Thanks to this, a first promising result could be shown with the fixed orthotropic structure (Fig.  It was shown that it was possible to control the gradient of the CNCs interparticle distance d as well as the thickness of the concentrated deposit near the membrane surface by tunning these parameters. For example, in Figure  The next step will be to characterize the mechanical strength and corresponding change in structural organization of these cellulose nanocomposites, using in-situ SAXS extension\/compresion tests.",

The study will be performed on an IPN microgel at high PAAc content that, in a recent rheological study [1], has revealed liquid-glass and glass-jammed transitions at increasing concentration. Moreover, the system is characterized by a volume phase transition (VPT) from a swollen to a shrunken state around T=305 K, therefore it would be interesting to probe the dynamics and structure as a function of temperature across the VPT for a microgel with high PAAc content, at high concentration. In these conditions, the VPT will be accompanied by a transition from a liquid to an arrested state and to a change in the particle softness [2]. samples.

    "title":"Interaction of synaptic vesicles with lipid membranes modulated by synapsin: \r\na structural investigation by x-ray reflectivity and GISAXS",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Towards an understanding of the interaction of synaptic vesicles with the inner leaflet of the synaptic membrane, and  to explore the modulating role of the cytosolic protein synapsin, we propose an advanced interface sensitive x-ray scattering experiment on a well controlled model system, using a Langmuir lipid monolayer with synaptic vesicles and synapsin in the subphase. \r\nSynapsin is held responsible for the formation of SV pools and believed to strongly interact with lipid membranes.   This model system can capture essential steps and structural mechanisms of vesicle adhesion to a membrane, e.g. like interaction range, contact area, adhesion state, lateral correlation in adhering SVs, as well as structural changes of the bilayer induced by adhering vesicles. For the first time, this assay will also address the pivotal role of the protein synapsin. The 22keV beam of three undulators operated in the third harmonic was collimated to 20x30 \u00b5m 2 with a flux of approximately 10 12 ph\/s. Vesicles were injected into the subphase to test their interaction with the monolayersynapsin complex. Pure lipid model vesicles LV 4 (55% DOPC, 20% DOPS, 15% DOPE, 10% cholesterol) served as a control for SVs from rat brain. As a control for the role of synapsin, the vesicles were added first into the subphase, followed by synapsin. After monolayer and effector(s) were prepared, CaCl2 was added in addition. For each run (new trough), XRR and GISAX and GID scans were recorded, sequentially after each preparation step. The minimum filter wheel position was set to 3 (attenuation factor 0.0347), acquisition time per scan point was 1s (XRR, low q), or 5s (XRR, high q), respectively. The trough was translated after each measurement set (XRR+GID). Resulting curves were checked for radiation damage. One measurement set took 25 minutes; 80 sets were recorded in total. During acquisition and the injection, the surface pressure was also recorded. Two Langmuir troughs where used for the experiment. The beamline specific 400 ml with a single Teflon barrier compressing the monolayer, allowing for a pressure control during the experiment. In this configuration each experimental step was measured at three different surface pressures \u03a0 = (30, 20, 10) mN\/m. The second half of the experiment a smaller trough with 25 ml subphase volume was placed in the larger one, allowing for higher concentrations of the limited synapsin protein and SVs. This configuration does not allow pressure control, as it has no barrier to change the monolayer area. Lipids where added in order to reach an initial surface pressure of approx. \u03a0 =20 mN\/m. Evaporation from the subphase and the parasitic scattering was circumvented or reduced by closing a hood over the trough and flushing with water-saturated helium. The smaller trough allowed for a synapsin concentration of up to 9.6 nM in the subphase. Fig. ",

    "title":"Liquid crystal topological defects at the nanoscale precision",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"We will study topological defects in smectic liquid crystals at the scale of a single defect or a very small number of defects, using nano-diffraction on a thin film (8CB smectic liquid crystal) made of topological defects  oriented by a rubbed polymer substrate. The aim will be to study defect core structures and elastic distortions around the core at a scale that is still poorly understood for liquid crystal materials. We will also study how these structures evolve when approaching the transition to nematic phase or when nanoparticles are confined and organised within the core of these defects. We will scan in 1D, perpendicular to the oriented defects, both in GISAXS (reflection) and in TSAXS (transmission) to allow at each point for a full reconstruction of the smectic layer distortion and topological defects determination. Data analysis will take advantage of the methodology previously established in average, allowing for a future automatic analysis of the nanoscale 1D scanning. We study 4-n-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) smectic A liquid crystal (LC) films, either pure thin films or composites thin films with nanoparticles (NPs). The LC film is characterized by an antagonist anchoring at the two interfaces because the 8CB smectic layers are perpendicular to the substrate (glass substrate with 10nm of rubbed PVA polymer) with their normal fixed along the rubbing of the polymer and parallel to the 8CB-air interface. This hybrid anchoring leads to an original texture called \"oily streaks\" where the Sm layers are curved into flattened hemicylinders oriented along a single direction (Figure  (b) It is consequently of interest to study the nanoscale features of LC TDs, revealing their core size but also the elastic distortion around the core, both for pure samples and for LCs with NPs confined in the TD cores and to study the NP organization in relation with the defect characteristics. We have thus performed a first test of nano-diffraction at the ESRF beamline ID01. The idea was to scan the sample with a beam of size around 60nm and record the scattered intensity during the scanning. In particular a scan perpendicular to the hemicylinders (Ox direction in Figure  Results and conclusions of the study 0.1 Pure LC thin film : Figure  The organization of gold nanospheres has also been successfully measured with the X-ray beam width as small as 60 nm. Gold nanospheres with a radius of 3 nm were embedded in a 180 nm thick LC film. The formation of a 2-dimensional hexagonal network  2D scan were performed for repeatability purposes and to assess the radiation damages. We scanned a 20 \u00b5m x 10 \u00b5m area during 500 s. No variation along the hemicylinders occured during the first seconds of measurements as shown on Figure  In conclusion, during these 48 hours of test measurements at ID01, we successfully measured the X-ray scattering signal associated with 8CB smectic layers superimposed into flattened hemicylinders. We also measured the scattering of gold nanosphere assemblies confined in the smectic topological defects AND its expected variations during a scanning perpendicular to the smectic hemicylinders. These encouraging results deserve now accurate and extensive measurements of both pure LC and of composites with nanospheres of various sizes and with nanorods. These future measurements will require a careful adjustment of the beamstop, a close attention to the effects of radiation damages and the building of 8CB hemicylinders that would be perfectly straight along more than 10\u00b5m. This will allow for a study of the different zones of smectic defects independently. A determination of both defect cores and elastic distortion around the cores will become possible. The specific structural determination of the NP assemblies within each specific defect will also become possible allowing for a fine study of the interaction between topological defects and NPs.",

    "title":"Unravelling the Twist in Narwhal Tusk with Hierarchical X-Ray Scattering Tensor Tomography",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Narwhals are mysterious animals whose tusk has a unique spiral structure with highly anisotropic mechanical properties. We hypothesize that the orientation of the nanostructure reflects the spiral macrostructure, defining its mechanical properties. Previous experiments have shown microstructure with a high anisotropy in the tusk direction with helical deviations from the tusk axis, however, the small sample size restricted the ability to connect the macrostructure to the local features investigated. How the organization of the nanostructure connects to these macroscopic features can only be done by probing the nanostructure through scattering in macroscopic samples. Therefore, we propose to use small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography with a high-energy beam to study the 3D arrangement of the mineralised collagen fibres in the tusk at the macroscopic scale. That will be of high importance for understanding the structure of the tusk and its connection to tusk mechanics. The aim of the experiment was to study the orientation of the narwhal tusk's building blocks (i.e., mineralised collagen fibrils) in the macroscopic length scale. This experiment belongs to a larger study with the goal of studying the orientation of the tusk's building blocks at different length scales to reconstruct the overall hierarchical structure of the left-hand spiral tusk (experimental report from experiment SC-5257). We hypothesize that the orientational arrangement of collagen fibrils and biomineral nanocrystals is directly related to the spiral nature of the tusk and its mechanical properties. Thereby its determination is an essential piece of the spiral puzzle of narwhal tusks. Two samples were extracted at different positions in the tusk and mounted on PMMA rods instead of metallic needles to prevent X-ray absorption at high tilt angles. The samples were further milled to the right dimensions and shape with an in-house automated lathe. A cylindric piece of narwhal tusk extracted radially from the pulp chamber (sample ID108, diameter: 5 mm, length: 7 mm) and a sample consisting of the tusk tip (sample ID105, diameter: 6 mm, length: 10 mm) were measured in this experiment. The experimental configuration for small-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomography (SASTT) consisted of motorised stages for vertical and horizontal translation mounted on top of an Eulerian cradle with rotation in the horizontal axis (\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd) and a motorised goniometer on top of the translation stages with rotation movement around the vertical axis (\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc). Initially, a Maxipix detector was placed downstream to record the scattering signal at a sample-to-detector distance of 4944 mm. An in-vacuum flight tube was placed between the sample and the detector to minimise absorption and scattering from the air. A semitransparent beamstop was used to record the beam transmission during the experiment. Multiple issues related to detector stability, which affected the quality of the recorded signal, and the transmission of the semitransparent beamstop at the used energy (60.0 keV), impeded obtaining data with good enough quality for the purpose. Based on the advice of the beamline staff, we decided to change the detector configuration and X-ray beam parameters. During this process, the beamline staff was of immense help, providing all the necessary assistance and support. A Pilatus 3 X CdTe 2M detector at a sample-to-detector distance of 2434 mm was used in the definitive configuration, with which we obtained highquality data at an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. A He-filled plastic flight tube and an opaque beamstop were placed between the sample and the detector. During the experiment, a 40.5 keV X-ray beam was used to obtain low enough X-ray absorption while maximizing the desired q-range (10 -2 -10 0 \u00c5 -1 ) including the scattering signal of the biomineral particles and the diffraction signal of the collagen D-period.

    "abstract_inverted_index":"Electrofluids are a new type of soft conductors consisting of concentrated conductive particle suspensions with transient contacts. Both the structure and the deformation behavior under mechanical stress determine the properties of these materials. We propose to use Ultra Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (USAXS) to study the 3D network structure of carbon black particles in solvents with different polarity and combine it with in situ rheology experiments to investigate the dynamic nature of the networks by studying their recovery after deformation. We will correlate the fractal dimensions of the agglomerates and their changes upon shear deformation with the mechanoelectrical properties of these materials. The weaker interaction of CB with glycerol leads to easier rearrangement of the network and, therefore, weaker internal stresses. Furthermore, the influence of shear frequency has been investigated. Figure  Figure  Future analysis of the data will focus on the direction dependency of the CB network recovery (parallel vs. perpendicular to shear direction) and the kinetics of network formation from ultra small-angle X-ray scattering curves.

    "title":"Graft brush copolymers as a platform for independent architectural control of softness, firmness, and strength",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"The objective of this work is to further explore the potential of a new class of brush thermoplastic elastomers for application as a framework for full replication of tissue strength, softness, and firmness. Unlike conventional ABA thermoplastic elastomers that we explored in our previous works published in Nature and Science, the A-g-B brush block copolymers have A-block segments randomly grafted through the strand backbone. In the present experiment, we will explore the space of structural parameters of these materials such as the grafting density and degree of polymerization of the side chains for the bottle-brush block,\r\nthe chemical nature, and the degree of polymerization of the end-capping blocks. The combined in-situ USAXS\/WAXS coupled with mechanical stretching and heating experiments will help us understand the molecular-scale processes occurring during mechanical deformation, the evolution of the microstructural organization, and its correlation to the mechanical properties. Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are mechanically distinct materials broadly used as high-performance tapes, transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS), and soft robotics.  A primary condition for pressure-sensitive adhesion is establishing a large contact area to maximize the number of molecular interactions with a substrate. For an elastic material to spontaneously wet a substrate with a roughness of \u223c1 \u03bcm, the equilibrium modulus of the material should be below the Dahlquist criterion as G < G C = 0.1 MPa.  To remedy the inherent drawbacks of mixture-based HMPSAs, we develop an alternative, additive-free approach by implementing the viscoelastic demands of moldable PSAs into a single-molecule system via A-g-B bottlebrush graft-copolymers, where a controlled fraction of linear A-blocks is dispersed along a bottlebrush B-block (Figure  ), and the entanglement DP may increase up to n e \u2245 2000, which effectively disentangles the network strands, allowing the softness of G \u223c 10 3 Pa (Table  Synthesis of Brush HMPSAs. A comprehensive library of A-g-B bottlebrush graft-copolymers (Figure  Structural and Thermal Analysis. The synthesized bottlebrush graft-copolymers undergo microphase separation of the linear PS and brush PIB blocks to form a robust physical network with PS domains acting as physical crosslinks. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were performed to investigate the effect of different architectural parameters on network morphology. AFM imaging of A-g-Bs with identical n sc = 18, n g = 1, n x = 180, and n bb = 2000 corroborated microphase separation, where the domain size increases from 29.6 \u00b1 3.5 to 59.3 \u00b1 5.9 nm with the DP of PS   for microphase-separated brush networks (Figure  Controlling Adhesive Performance through Viscoelastic Response. The effect of the brush motif (n sc , n g , and n x ) on viscoelasticity has been reported previously for covalent bottlebrush networks,  The ability to tune the HMPSA viscoelasticity by regulating polymer architecture enables further programming of the work of adhesion and debonding mechanisms. The work of adhesion (W adh ) of the brush HMPSAs was measured by probe tack testing at strain rates (\u03b5) from approximately 0.001-1 s -1 and further normalized by the film thickness and elastic modulus (Figures  ), which is dictated by cavity crack propagation along the surface of the substrate. Debonding above the Rouse rate is governed by cavity growth into the bulk followed by fibrillation, which scales as  A unique feature of A-g-B brush architecture is the ability to regulate the deformation response at both small and large deformations. At small deformations specifically, we can tune the modulus and Rouse time to cover a broad-range work of adhesion spanning elastic to viscoelastic regimes (Figure  ) exhibited by a pronounced tack peak followed by an extended yielding plateau, which decays with deformation due to low strain-stiffening (\u03b2 = 0.17). In contrast, the sample with \u03c4 R = 0.8 debonds elastically ( < ) with no tack peak but a strong increase in pull-off stress with deformation due to more intense strain-stiffening (\u03b2 = 0.37). A sample with intermediate values of \u03b2 and \u03c4 R shows an intermediate debonding behavior, exhibiting both a weak tack peak and a limited strain-stiffening effect. Brush HMPSAs also bolster their mechanical integrity with the ability to independently tune strength by architecture independent of modulus and strain-stiffening.  while the strength directly increases strain at the break (\u03b5 max ) of cohesive fracture. The architectural platform for the design of HMPSAs enables hot-melt processing of tapes with programmable viscoelasticity and melting temperature (Figure  In conclusion, brush architecture unlocks unprecedented property control over viscoelastic and adhesive properties for a wide range of applications without the use of chemical additives. Specifically, the A-g-B architecture empowers wide-ranging control of the network modulus, the Rouse time, and strainstiffening with deformation by varying a distinct set of architectural parameters including the side chain length, grafting density, and volume fraction of the A block. This compels unprecedented structural control of the adhesive performance covering almost 4 orders of magnitude of the work of adhesion and 6 orders of magnitude of debonding rates, spanning both viscoelastic and elastic debonding mechanisms. The ability to enhance the strain-stiffening behavior at large deformations prevents cohesive rupture, which in combination with the lack of additives results in no residue on a substrate after debonding. The physical nature of A-g-B networks allows for hot-melt preparation and 3D-printing of these PSAs with complex shapes. The ability to independently control n A and \u03d5 A allows for tuning the flow temperature, T flow , for molding at moderate temper- ) with a characteristic tack peak followed by a decaying yielding plateau (red curve). At the same pulling rate of = 1s 1 , the sample (n sc = 18, n g = 4, and n x = 149) with \u03c4 R = 0.8 s undergoes elastic debonding ( < 1 R ) without a tack peak followed by an increase in stress due to higher firmness (\u03b2 = 0.37) (black curve). The sample (n sc = 18, n g = 8, and n x = 450) with characteristics (\u03b2 = 0.24, \u03c4 R = 2.5 s) shows an intermediary behavior with a smaller tack peak and a slight increase in stress with deformation (blue curve).  https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acsami.3c07821 ACS Appl.

    "title":"Dynamics of tubulin nucleation and assembly",
    "abstract_inverted_index":"Tubulin nucleation and microtubule (MT) assembly are frequent events in cells. To understand the fundamental mechanisms of MT assembly it is critical to resolve the early stages of the reaction, dictating the assembly pathway. Despite years of research, tubulin nucleation is still one of the least understood steps of MT dynamics, owing to the size of tubulin and its highly dynamic character. To determine the fundamental molecular-level mechanisms directing tubulin nucleation and the early assembly states, we will reconstitute in vitro a minimal model system that mimics the key elements of cytoskeleton MT assembly. We will use time-resolved solution small angle-X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) and our advanced analysis tools to follow in real-time, the active self-organization, dynamic structures, and bioenergetics of tubulin proteins and their regulation by fluxes of chemical energy, associated with nucleotide hydrolysis reactions. \r\n software using our cutting-edge state-of-the-art algorithms, containing more than 100,000 lines of open-source C++ and CUDA codes, running on both CPU and GPU platforms. The capabilities of D+ exceeds earlier programs by several orders of magnitudes in terms of flexibility and complexity of the modeled structures and computation speed (see Figure  Figure  The nucleation of tubulin and its assembly into MT were studied in the presence of excess GTP. Assembly was triggered by a temperature jump from 5 to 36\u00b0C and followed by time-resolved X-ray scattering. The assembly reactions start from a solution of cold (5\u00b0C) tubulin and end in a solution of tubulin at 36\u00b0C. At the end point MTs form and Figure  To resolve the ensemble of GTP and GDP-tubulin assemblies formed at low temperature, we have used off-line size exclusion chromatography (SEC) setup and analyzed the data of different fractions. We discovered that the solutions rapidly attained equilibrium (in the GDP-tubulin solution) or equilibrium-like state (in the GTP-tubulin solution). The entire SAXS data set were consistent with a thermodynamic model of tubulin single rings and curved tubulin oligomers. The analysis revealed a dimer-dimer association free energy of -14.2 and -13.2 kBT for GDP-and GTP-tubulin, respectively. Surprisingly, in the solution of GDP-tubulin, we have also detected a small fraction of stable tubulin single rings, not predicted by the thermodynamic model. The radius of the rings was 19.2nm. In the GTP solution, the fraction of stable rings was significantly lower. Figure  Using the state-of-the-art solution synchrotron time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) at ID02, we discovered a disassembly catastrophe (half-life of \u223c0.1 s) of tubulin rings and oligomers upon dilution or addition of GTP (Figure  Using SEC-eluted tubulin dimers in an assembly buffer solution free of glycerol and tubulin aggregates enabled us to start from a well-defined initial thermodynamic ensemble of isolated dynamic tubulin dimers and short oligomers. Following a temperature increase, time-resolved X-ray scattering and cryo-transmission electron microscopy during the initial nucleation phase revealed an isodesmic assembly mechanism of one-dimensional (1D) tubulin oligomers (where dimers were added and\/or removed one at a time), leading to sufficiently stable two-dimensional (2D) dynamic nanostructures, required for MT assembly (Figure ",
