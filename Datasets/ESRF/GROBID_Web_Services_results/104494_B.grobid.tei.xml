<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CERIC EXPERIMENTAL REPORT Proposal number: 20227112 Title: Unraveling the De-/Lithiation Mechanism of different (Bismuth-doped) Niobium Oxides via ex situ and operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</head><p>Proposer: Giovanni Orazio LEPORE Beamline(s): LISA@ESRF Shift: 18 Achievements: Within this experiment, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted for both non-doped monoclinic and (Bidoped) orthorhombic Nb2O5 in the 1 st and 200 th cycles at either Nb K-edge or Bi LIII-edge, complemented by ex situ measurements for electrodes after 200 cycles. Spectra at the Nb K-edge and Bi LIII-edge were collected in transmission mode, and simultaneously in fluorescence mode for the Bi LIII-edge. A preliminary analysis of the XANES indicates that: i) The local environment of monoclinic Nb2O5 between the 1 st and 200 th cycles is different. ii) The Nb K-edge for orthorhombic (Bi-doped) Nb2O5 exhibits an intense evolution in the local geometry in the first cycle. Nevertheless, its oxidation state reaches the initial state (Nb 5+ ) after a full cycle, which is in agreement with the ex situ XANES data. iii) The spectra at the Bi LIII-edge reveal a reduction from Bi 3+ to metallic bismuth, and then further to LixBi. Upon delithiation, Bi was only partially reoxidized to its metallic form after the first full cycle. During the 200 th cycle, the same behavior was observed, i.e., at 0.01 V, the LixBi alloy is formed and at 3.0 V, metallic Bi 0 was found, but with a bit low oxidation state.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Report</head><p>Graphite is still the anode material of choice for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity of around 370 mAh g -1 vs. Li + /Li, low de-/lilthiation potential, enabling high specific energy at the full cell level. However, the slow kinetics of the lithium intercalation may lead to serious lithium plating during rapid charging, particularly at low temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> For this reason, finding an alternative anode active material to enable fast charging while maintaining a high degree of safety is of utmost importance. Among the many possibilities, Nb2O5 attracted increasing attention recently, due to its promising performances in the voltage range of 0.01-3.0 V, similar to graphite. Research on Nb2O5 is also attracting a lot of attention owing to its rich structural chemistry. Different calcination temperatures can yield different Nb2O5 polymorphs, each exhibiting distinctive electrochemical behavior upon cycling. For instance, monoclinic Nb2O5 (H-Nb2O5) shows fast lithium diffusion through the tunnels within the octahedral blocks enclosed by shear planes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> Peculiarly, the initial structure remains unchanged upon dis-/charge in the voltage range from 0.01 V to 3.0 V, leading to a high reversible initial specific capacity of around 400 mAh g -1 , but it suffers from pronounced fading upon long-term cycling. A different polymorph, orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5) can be synthesized when applying lower calcination temperatures, and shows a pronounced pseudo-capacitive behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> The initial phase transition from T-Nb2O5 to a NbO-type phase and further to monoclinic B-phase Nb2O5 in the initial cycle appears to contribute to good cycling stability and rate capability. Introducing bismuth as a dopant into the T-Nb2O5 host structure leads to an increase of the initial capacity up to about 450 mAh g -1 at 0.05 A g -1 , which decreases to around 300 mAh g -1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g -1 . In our previous experiment (CERIC 20217084), the ex situ XAS spectra for the 1 st and 2 nd cycles were collected, showing that the structures of both T-Nb2O5 and H-Nb2O5 develop in a very complex way upon cycling. However, the ex situ spectra do not provide real-time structural evolution during the whole de-/lithiation process. Operando XAS measurements, as performed herein, now filled this gap: the operando pouch cells comprised pristine electrodes and electrodes recovered after the 200 cycles to obtain data at different stages of the long-term cycling process. The pouch cells for the operando measurements were assembled in a dry room with a dew point below -70 o C. These cells were sealed and transported in a dry state to LISA@ESRF. Shortly before the experiment, a blister containing the electrolyte was opened to allow the electrolyte to wet the electrodes and separator. After that, the cell was connected to portable potentiostat Biologic VSP-150 for galvanostatic cycling. Considering that the cell configuration influences the overpotential and electrochemical performance, we compared each result with the ex situ samples at certain potentials to validate the operando data. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> displays the XANES spectra of H-Nb2O5 at the Nb K-edge obtained during the operando experiment in the 1 st cycle. From these data it is possible to detect a shift towards lower energies upon lithiation, followed by a restoration of the initial state upon delithiation. The evolution of the spectra during the 200 th cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) looks similar as during the 1 st cycle: the pre-edge was shifted towards lower energy upon lithiation, since the insertion of Li + results in a reduction of oxidation state of Nb. However, the comparison of the two cycles and the ex situ data reveal some minor differences, indicative of incremental structural changes occurring upon cycling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). Accordingly, the results provide a good explanation for the relatively high Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle and the gradual capacity upon cycling. In the case of (Bi-doped) Nb2O5, the overall evolution of the Nb K-edge spectra displayed a nearly-consistent trend. The first cycle exhibits an irreversible structural change, while the subsequent cycles maintain a similar overall structure with minor changes, as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Regarding the spectra collected at the Bi LIII-edge, the bismuth dopant was gradually reduced to metallic bismuth and further to lithium bismuth alloy when the fully reacted to LixBi at 0.01 V, as the pre-edge and LIII-edge are situated between the calculated monoclinic Li3Bi and calculated/experimental Bi metal. Upon reoxidation, the bismuth species returned to metallic bismuth at 3.0 V. A lower shift in the edge position was observed between 1 st and 200 th cycle, indicating that the bismuth was involved in an irreversible electrochemical reaction, which leads to a lower specific capacity after a few cycles. The results are displayed in Nb K-edge Bi-doped Nb 2 O 5 Figure 3. The Nb K-edge spectra of the selected Bi-doped Nb2O5 samples from operando XANES measurements for comparison. In summary, the preliminary analysis of the operando results is generally in line with the ex situ experiments. Further quantitative investigation and in-depth EXAFS analysis will advance the mechanistic understanding of this class of fast-charging anodes and facilitate further research in this area. In addition, we would like to mention that we are as always very satisfied with the high-quality spectra collected at this beamline and the professionalism of the beamline staff throughout the experiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
