<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remarks:</head><p>During our experiment period, we have studied the molecular-scale speciation of As in selected natural coloids samples obtained from metal(loid)s contaminated soil samples aiming to assess the role of soil natural colloidal particles as nanovectores of toxic elements in the contamination process of the soil-water system (Report 1). In addition, we could perform suplementary studies of As speciation in two bulk soil samples aiming to complete our previous study (EC649 and corresponding experimental report) on the geochemical behaviour and distribution of As in contaminated soils and to elucidate the role of preferential water flow phenomena on their sorption mechanisms in the soil (Report 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report 1:</head><p>Arsenic associated with colloidal particles is an important vector for As migration in contaminated soils. Using Asymmetric-Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AsFlFFF) coupled to an inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometer (ICP-MS), we determined the As distribution as a function of the particle size of the colloidal fraction of soils samples. The samples were collected from stained preferential flow paths and bulk soil samples, impacted by a mine waste. Physical and chemical properties of the colloids were also determined using X-ray-diffraction, SEM and TEM. Arsenic and Fe speciation in the colloidal fraction was characterized using X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy techniques. Preliminary results indicated that more than 47% of the As mobilized in the preferential flow paths (70.5 mg/L) was associated with the colloidal fraction of the soil. Instead, 5% (2 mg/L) of the mobile As in the bulk samples of the soil was colloidal As. Common to both samples, a similar fractogram (1-1000 nm) was obtained for As, Fe and Al, suggesting an association of As with Fe and/or Al colloidal particles. As XAS analysis of the colloidal fractions (&gt;10 nm) of the soil samples, indicated As adsorption on ferrihydrite as the main As-colloid retention mechanism. The presence of Fe oxyhydroxides in addition to phyllosilicates was also showed by Fe X-ray absorption analysis. These results show the important role of Fe-oxyhydroxides as nanovectors of colloidal As in preferential flow paths and bulk samples of a contaminated soil.</p><p>During our experiment, As and Fe k-edge XANES spectra were measured on bending-magnet BM25A beamline (SpLine) (6 GeV, 100 mA, Si(111) monochromator crystals) in fluorescence model using a Vortex, one-element solid detector (RT) and an He-cryostat in quench-frozen samples. The samples corresponded to selected natural colloidal soil samples obtained from a contaminated scenario located in Madrid province (Spain). The SpLine X-ray energy range (5 -35 keV) allowed determination of both Fe and As edges. The average of all the spectra for each samples was perfomed using the computer package Athena.</p><p>However, unconclusive XANES spectra were obtained due to the low As concentration in the samples and the use of a Vortex, one-element solid detector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In order to confirm our results, additional beamtime were allocated under the CRG Spline proposal 25-01-828 (see report Cod. 25-01-828) and preliminary results have been presented as: Garrido, F., Laborda, F., Bolea, E., Helmhart, M., O'Day, P., and Serrano, S. 2011.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report 2.</head><p>The effect of preferential flow on the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of As, Cu and Zn in a metal(loid) polluted soil was studied within the river bed of a small stream that collects surface runoff from an arsenic-bearing, mainly as scrorodite (FeAsO 4 •2H 2 O), waste pile near an abandoned mine. Water flow domains, either preferential or matrix, were identified by staining techniques, a detailed soil sampling procedure, and statistical analysis. General soil properties were studied in each flow domain. In addition, total metal(loid) content and chemical distribution by means of sequential extraction procedure were done within each flow domain. Lastly, As speciation was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) methods. An upper river bed and its underlying subsoil were distinguished, and both were characterized by low pH and high As, Cu, Zn and Fe concentrations as compared to the adjacent soil. Metal(oid) concentrations were higher in the river bed than in the subsoil due to the accumulation of incoming material from the waste pile. In the river bed, higher metal(oid) concentrations were found in the preferential flow domain compared to matrix flow. Instead in the subsoil, preferential flow paths were characterized by a lower ion exchange capacity and lower Cu and Zn concentrations from acidic leaching, and higher concentrations of total organic matter attributed to high root content, compared to the soil matrix. Arsenic was mainly concentrated in the preferential flow paths as As(V). XAS analysis indicated As sorption on iron hydroxide phases as the primary retention mechanism in the subsoil, which may be a reversible process if geochemical conditions change. Preferential flow, acting as a by-pass connecting the highly contaminated river bed layer with deeper soil, has an impact on the distribution of metal(oids) at the study site and may increase the risk for groundwater contamination.</p><p>Overall, our results have been presented in:</p><p>Helmhart, H., O'Day, P.A., Garcia-Guinea, J., Serrano, S., and Garrido, F. 2011.
