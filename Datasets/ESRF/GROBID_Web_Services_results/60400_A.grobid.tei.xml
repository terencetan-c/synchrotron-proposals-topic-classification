<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This approach had the benefit of both techniques allowing a clear identification of phase creating during the reaction. However the limited thickness of the electrode strongly limited the quality of acquisition, effectively due the small amount of material presents on the optical path the grain orientation statistics where very low with a consequence effect on the relative intensity of the pics that are no more directly related to crystallographyc phase. Such inconvenience has make vane a fully accurate analysis of in situ data as sequential Rietveld refinements or Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), but the data has been still treated semi-quantitatively by the use of Le Bail fit .</p><p>Three cationic system in water solution has been studied for Sulphur based and selenium base Chevrel phases : Cd ++ alone , Cd ++ and Co ++ , nd finally the Cd ++ Co ++ and Ni ++ . The combined data show without a doubt that Chevrel phases intercalates preferentially Cd ++ in respect to the other cation tested both for Selenium and Sulphur although in the cyclic voltammetry small cation as Co and Ni presents lower intercalation voltage. The complementarity of electrochemical and diffraction technique has allows to single out a complex kinetic equilibrium between the intercalated phase and the existence of two kind of Cd phase (Cd2Mo6S8 and CdMo6S8) although cyclic voltammetry shows only one intercalation peak As already said the semi-quantitavive approach with Le Bail fit has allows to evaluated the phase kinetic and to associate them with electrochemistry as visible for instance in figure 3, for the intercalation of Mo6S8 in a tri-cation solution of Ni, Co, Cd. The intercalation reaction is semi-reversible with a two phases mechanism, indeed during the intercalation the potential remain constant and cell parameter for the involved phase are also constant the chevrel phase form directly a rich Cd2Mo6S8 avoiding to the poor ternary phase CdMo6S8 which is form only along the de-intercalation, however during further intercalation the rich Cd2Mo6S8 is formed by direct intercalation of Mo6S8 and for intercalation of CdMo6S8 Finally ex situ data collected on capillary filled with electrochemistry intercalated chevrel phases has allows to define the crystal structure of the Cd phases Figure 2 cyclic voltammetry of an chevrel phase electrode in Ni Cd Co solution green grey and red curves respectively 1x10 6 1x10 6 1x10 6 1x10 6 1x10 6 1x10 6 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.1 mA 0.2 mA V Ag/AgCl (V) time (s) Electrode 3) 13.41 mg 1.61 10 -5 mol 4.46e-6+3.11e-5 mol e -1.15e-5 mol e -150 200 250 300 350 400 Mo 6 S 8 0 10 20 30 Poor Cd 1 Mo 6 S 8 Normalized intensity 0 10 20 30 40 Rich Cd 2 Mo 6 S 8 Figure 3 electrochemistry and associate phase evolution during intercalation reaction</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : ESRF experimental setup</figDesc><graphic coords="1,33.95,519.10,199.95,159.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
