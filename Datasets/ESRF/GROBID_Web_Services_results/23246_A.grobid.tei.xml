<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In our experiments, we have used sterically stabilised gibbsite (γ-Al(OH) 3 ) platelets in organic solvent. Dispersions of this kind of particles are known to display both the isotropic (I) to nematic (N) and the nematic to columnar (C) phase transition, due to their anisotropy (diameter = 200 ± 30 nm, thickness = 13 ± 4 nm). A sample was brought at a volume fraction of about 40% (in the N-C biphasic regime), after which two glass capillaries (0.3 x 3 x 50 mm 3 ) were filled with the sample. In the solution, non-adsorbing polymer (PDMS, molecular weight M w = 423 kg/mol, concentration 0.2 g/l) was present, promoting the formation of oriented single-domains. After 1 week, N-C phase separation was complete. At this point, the capillaries were subjected to SAXS experiments at DUBBLE, using an X-ray beam with a photon energy of 10 keV. Scattering patterns were obtained using a gas-filled detector at a distance of 8 metres from the sample. By placing the beam stop at the corner of the detector, access to a q range of about 0.025 to 0.8 nm -1 was achieved.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows two examples of typical scattering patterns of the nematic phase. In fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> the scattering presumably originates from two domains with different orientation. We were also able to measure scattering patterns from singledomain regions (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). The features in the s cattering at higher q values (typically 0.3 to 0.6 nm -1 ) originate from the shortest interparticle distances d, in the direction normal to the platelets. The pronounced directionality (especially in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) reflects a high degree of orientational order in the irradiated part of the sample. A second-order maximum of the structure factor can be also seen in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>.</p><p>By scanning the samples vertically, we have observed a pronounced effect of gravitational compression on the interparticle separation d in the (presumed) columnar liquid crystalline phase, as depicted in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. By moving downwards through the sample (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A through 2D</ref>), the position of the maximum q max in the scattered intensity shifts to higher q values. This shift reflects a decrease of the interparticle separation distance due to an increasing osmotic pressure. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we show the dependence of d on the height in the sample y (with the y axis pointing downwards), 100 200 300 400 500 1 10 100 1000 Intensity A 0 100 200 300 400 Columns 0 100 200 300 400 500 Rows 0 100 200 300 400 500 Columns 1 10 100 1000 10000 Intensity B 0 100 200 300 400 500 Rows where d is calculated from the scattering data as d = 2π/q max . Note that in this sample the orientational correlation (vertical columns of horizontally-oriented platelets) persists over an extraordinary long distance of nearly 1 centimetre. The height dependant interparticle distance d(y) can be analysed using a simple osmotic pressure model. The gravitational force experienced by the colloidal platelets should be compensated by the gradient of their osmotic pressure Π. Starting from mechanical equilibrium and using a Taylor expansion, it can be shown that *, n gnm ny ∂Π∂ = ∂∂ (1)</p><p>where n is the number density of platelets, m* is their excess mass (relative to the mass of the equivalent volume of solvent) and g is gravitational acceleration. We assume that the osmotic pressure can be written as 0 (), (())</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">kT y Adyd Π= -<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where kT is the thermal energy, A is area per particle and d 0 is the minimum distance between the plates (at infinite pressure). Moreover, we assume that A is virtually independent of the height y. This assumptions can be shown to lead to the following relation between the platelets separation distances d 1 and d 2 at two different heights y 1 and y 2 2021012 101020 () ln, ()()</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">dddddyy dddddd ξ  --- +=  ---  (3)</formula><p>where ξ = kT / gm* is the gravitational length. The solid line in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> presents a fit of Eq. 3 through the data points d(y) as obtained from the SAXS experiment. The best fit is obtained with d 0 = 9.2 nm and ξ = 3 mm, which are within a reasonable range for our system.</p><p>In conclusion, we have been able to identify oriented single domains in the nematic phase. Furthermore, we observed gravitational compression in the more highly ordered phase. The height dependence can be fitted quite reasonably using a simple osmotic pressure model. Yet, from the scattering data we could not explicitly determine whether this denser phase was smectic or columnar.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Scattering patterns of the nematic phase, at two different locations in the sample.
