<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goals of studying nucleation density, critical cluster sizes and out-of-plane growth mode using real-time GISAXS and growth oscillation measurements were successfully completed. Due to technical difficulties (turbo pump failure) we had to use our backup UHV chamber and therefore not the molecule HBC but 6P and 6P-3,5-F2 was grown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments</head><p>We performed real time and in-situ investigations during the growth of 6P and 6P-3,5-F2 using a Dectris PILATUS 300K-W detector to simultaneously detect specular growth oscillations and diffuse GISAXS signals. The post-growth structure of the thin films was then measured by means of XRR and GIXD using a MaxiPix detector. The molecules were deposited on the substrate by OMDB (organic molecular beam deposition) inside our UHV chamber. The substrate temperature and the growth rate were varied for each run within 20-130°C and 1-15 A/min respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real-time Investigation of layer coverage</head><p>By using the PILATUS 300K-W we measured in-situ growth oscillations in XRR geometry at q anti-Bragg = ½ q Bragg . Independent of the substrate temperature and rate we observed that the weakly dipolar 6P-3,5-F 2 molecules are growing in smoother layers in comparison to the non-dipolar 6P molecules, were the island growth mode starts earlier. An example of one dataset for Anti-Bragg oscillations is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We have been able to model these growth oscillations by using the Trofimov model (s. V. <ref type="bibr">I. Trofimov et al., Thin Solid Films, 1997)</ref>. From the fits (red curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) we obtained information about the critical layer coverages, the in-situ roughness evolution of the films and the downhill transport rates. In the case of 6P the growth oscillations were damped much earlier which shows that in this case the film is getting rougher much faster.</p><p>The layer coverage plots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show the coverage of each layer as a function of time (i.e. film thickness during growth). Here 1 means that the layer is fully covered, while 0 stands for an empty layer. As can been seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> the filling of each layer starts earlier in the case of 6P, i.e. the film roughens more quickly and 3d 'wedding cake' islands form. As already mentioned these findings are true independently of the chosen substrate temperature and growth rate and, thus, it can be assumed that there origin lies in the effect of the dipole moment of the molecule. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-situ measurement of the island size evolution</head><p>In addtion to the investigation of the growth oscillations by using specularly reflected beam on the PILATUS detector, with its high dynamic range we were able to simultaneaously record the weak, diffuse in-situ GISAXS signal during the growth of the films. This in turn allows us to monitor the temporal evolution of the island formation. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> examplary GISAXS images corresponding to the above Anti-Bragg oscillations at the early stage of the film growth are shown for both molecules. In case of 6P-3,5-F2 we observed a larger peak splitting in comparison to the one in the case of 6P. This shows that the islands are smaller in the dipolar 6P-3,5-F2 molecular film (~300nm vs. &gt; 1µm). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combining results from specular and diffuse scattering investigation</head><p>By combining the results obtained from the GISAXS and the Anti-Bragg oscillations one can schematically illustrate the growth of the two molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). From the results above it follows that 6P forms bigger islands and rougher films. In contrast, 6P-3,5-F 2 films are smoother and the topmost islands are smaller and start to grow only when the underneath layer is almost fully covered. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p>The obtained results of the study are of high significance for further possible optoelectronic applications as well as for fundamental science where a molecular design with a dipole moment may help to positively influence the grown structure, e.g. to obtain smooth films. We are currently finishing the analysis and fitting of the whole dataset (i.e. for the full temporal evolution of GISAXS and for all growth conditions) and expect to submit a manuscript by the end of 2013.</p><p>We gratefully thank the local contacts Roberto Felici and Francesco Carlà and the whole staff of ID03 for the excellent and helpful support.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Growth oscillations obtained at the Anti-Bragg point of a) 6P and b) 6P-3,5-F2 at a substrate temperature of T=100°C and a deposition rate of 1.5 A/min. The oscillations were fitted using the Trofimov model (red curve). The grey curves in the background correspond to the layer coverage of each layer at each moment of the film growth. The larger damping of the oscillations in the case of 6P are due to a faster roughening of the film and indicate a growth mode change from layer-by-layer to island growth in comparison to 6P-3,5-F 2 .</figDesc><graphic coords="4,20.45,51.85,547.50,204.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
