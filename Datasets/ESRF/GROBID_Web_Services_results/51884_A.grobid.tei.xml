<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the framework of a multidisciplinary project we are developping a new approach to produce novel catalysts based on size-selected mono and bimetallic gas-phase clusters deposited on various substrates. Contrarily to the classical chemical method this production method can synthesize series of supported metal catalysts with a controlled and highly reproducible homogeneity using a cluster deposition set-up based on a laser vaporization source operating under UHV conditions. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> One of the typical limitation of this technique is the small amount of clusters that can be deposited onto surfaces in comparison to volumes for chemically prepared nanoparticles. To obtain a cluster loading sufficient (ca. 1 wt %) to allow XAFS measurements in fluorescence mode and catalysis activity monitoring, we have deposited metallic clusters on both sides of ultrathin (few μm) porous borosilicate supports that are subsequently ground into powder. Our recent experience has shown that the amount of clusters corresponding to several cm 2 of double-sided cluster deposition was sufficient to produce a detectable amount of CO 2 from the CO oxidation by O 2 in a laboratory flow bed reactor.</p><p>For this experiment we have prepared size-selected mono and bi-metallic Au and Pt-based gas phase clusters (ca. 2.5 nm), deposited with low coverage (0.5-1 ML -MonoLayer-) to prevent agglomeration onto borosilicates. The planned experiment was to measured these samples in situ in capillaries under various gas flows and temperatures using the integrated gas rig system recently installed at Dubble to mimic the laboratory CO oxidation conditions. The temperature provided with a heater gun was to be raised to 550ºC at a rate of 5 ºC / with 4 plateaus at RT, 150, 450 and 550 ºC programmed for combined XANES and EXAFS measurements.</p><p>Although Dubble gas rig integrated system has proved in our previous experiments to be efficient and flexible we have unfortunately run this time into series of serious technical and safety issues. This has forced us after many unsuccesful time consuming attempts (3-4 shifts) to finally cancel all the gas treatments and in situ measurements that were orignally planned in our proposal.</p><p>In the remaining time we have been able to successfully measure XAFS of our mono and bimetallic samples in air and at room temperature at Au and Pt L3 edges in fluorescent mode using the Ge 9-channel detector.</p><p>Collection of up to 20 scans with typical acquisition times of 30 min up to k = 10 Å -1 was required to obtain an acceptable signal to noise ratio for the bimetallic clusters that feature the lowest Pt loading. The averaged Pt-L 3 edge absorption spectrum of the AuPt bimetallic sample is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Despite the apparent limited data quality, crucial information such as the metal-metal distances, oxide content, and metal-support interactions needed for the extensive structural characterisation of these bimetallic metal clusters could be obtained with a detailed XAFS analysis. We are now ready to resubmit our proposal to perform the in situ measurements once Dubble gas rig is fully operational again.</p><p>(1)Bouwen, W.; Thoen, P.; Vanhoutte, F.; Bouckaert, S.; Despa, F.; Weidele, H.; Silverans, R.
