<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Resolving the microscopic nature of electronic phase separation in the CMR manganites via 3DXRD Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) in the manganite perovskites is understood to arise from intrinsic electronic phase separation (EPS) occurring because of the competition between ferromagnetic (FM) conducting and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orbitally ordered (OO) insulating phases, at specific doping levels.</p><p>However, the very nature of the EPS state has frustrated any attempts over the past 3 decades to accurately characterise the microscopic structures of its constituents. Here we propose a diffraction resolved tomography experiment with nano-focused beam on ID11 to tackle this long-standing problem. The results will allow for accurate microscopic structural models of the competing states to be ascertained for the first time and will also provide a 3-dimensional map of strain fields within the electronically separated phases on a 0.1-100 Î¼m length scale. Our insights will lead to a broader understanding of how these functional properties are linked with EPS phenomena so that these can be systematically tuned and enhanced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Data collected:</head><p>A significant number of 3DXRD scans were collected on 5 different crystallites of LPCMO at ~10 K intervals between 100 and 200K, and at room temperature. Crystalites were in the size range 15 -30 microns. Initial variable temperature scans were collect using the "half" scan approach in which a forward/backwards 180 degree scans (with 0.2 degree steps) was collected followed by successive rastering across the sample in 200 nm steps. Since the aims of the experiment hinged on being able to reconstruct the domain and phases coexisting structure on this ~200 nm length scale, establishing the resolution of the tomographic reconstructions under the in situ conditions (with cryostream operational) was a key part of the experiment.</p><p>Early on it was noticed that there was a significant systematic shift between forward and back scans, on the length scale of ~0.5 micron, which ultimately results in a significant blurring of the reconstructions. A significant amount of time during the experiment was given over to reducing these effects, including changing the angle of the cryostream, building a shield to deflect the crystostream gas away from the diffractometer and tyring to optimise the stiffness of the sample older. Ultimately from the data quality it seemed like none of these adjustments the experimental setup yielded the desired increase in stability. Devlopements are currenlty ongoing with the sample enviroment team at the ESRF. An alternative data collection strategy was finaly employed in the later half of the experiments which involved a continuous omega rotation and rastering of the sample, which seems promising with respect to evening out the effect of the uneven thermal expansion of the sample holder that possibly contributes to the loss of experimental data resolutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of data analysis progress and results so far</head><p>Reconstructions of all data sets revealed that a single grain / crystallite had been studied in all cases but with multiple domains of the Pbnm perovskite structure always present. In principle 6 domains are possible by symmetry (with respect to the Pm-3m aristotype). Selecting sub-classes of superstructure reflections only present in certain Pbnm domains, allows the reconstruction of the domain structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). At low temperatures (at and below 160 K), additional reflections due to the orbital order appear that in principle allow for a total of 12 domain state. Again, in most instance enough of these reflections are observed experimentally for the selective reconstruction of the domain structure. Significantly, from this it is found that, a given Pbnm domain only ever host one possible domain with respect to orbital ordering. This implies the coherence length of the orbital order is greater than that of the typical length scale of Pbnm domains (observed to be ~1-10 microns in the current experiment). Provisional results are shown below for one crystal at one temperature. More work is needed to develop data analysis routines to correct for sample drift during the experiment. This will allow for greater spatial resolution in the reconstruction allowing the subtle phase coexistence structure in associated with the orbital ordering and metallic phase to be probed. Data analysis is ongoing. </p></div>			</div>
