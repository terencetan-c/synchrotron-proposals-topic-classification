<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Ni/Al2O3 is the state-of-the-art catalyst for the methanation of CO2 due to the high selectivity and low cost of nickel. For this catalysts, sintering and oxidation of the nickel particles on the surface leads to a decrease in productivity with increasing time-on-stream, especially under dynamic H2 dropout conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> These dynamic H2 dropout conditions arise from the fluctuation of renewable energies and the associated fluctuation of green hydrogen supply. Therefore, a catalyst is needed that can withstand these dynamic conditions and has high activity, selectivity, and stability. Spinels provide atomically distributed Ni with high stability, but this makes it difficult to activate. However, we show that spinel phases can be tailored to allow low-temperature activation, resulting in finely divided and highly active Ni sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Furthermore, the redox reversibility of the spinel phase enables the reintegration and redispersion of the catalytically active Ni particles, thus reversing potential deactivation. This so-called concept of "Dynamic Responsive Methanation (DRM) Catalysts" is, with regard to the use of renewable energies for hydrogen production and the associated hydrogen dropouts, a possibility to utilize these dynamic operating conditions for reactivation of the catalyst.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedure</head><p>Ni0.9MnxAl2-xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) catalysts were prepared by coprecipitation of the corresponding nitrates with one molar sodium hydroxide at a constant pH of 9 and concurrent calcination at 800 °C. The supported NiMn1/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and subsequent calcination at 500 °C.</p><p>Ni &amp; Mn K-edges were measured in the XANES (for Ni: 8270 -8430 eV, Mn: 6500 -6650 eV) or EXASF (for Ni: 8230 -9330 eV, Mn: 6440 -7540 eV) range depending on the experiment. The XANES range is used to determine the oxidation states and can also be used with the linear combination analysis (LCA) to determine phase fractions based on reference samples. The EXAFS range will be used to determine bond lengths. In addition, XRD spectra (energy: 48.6 keV, wavelength: 0.25509 Å) were recorded to follow phase transitions during the experiments. The catalysts were tested using the quartz capillary flow reactor cells (1mm OD) and gas delivery systems available at the beamline. The corresponding spinel (Ni0.9Al2O4, Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4 or Ni0.9Mn1.75Al0.25O4) or supported catalyst were diluted 1:3 with Quartz, pressed, crushed and the 50 -100 μm fraction was filled into the capillaries. Depending on the experiment, the following procedures were used. The temperature programmed reductions (TPR) were conducted in 10% H2 in He, with a heating ramp of 7.5 K/min up to 900°C. Pretreatment/Reduction of the catalyst was carried out by heating to 450 °C and holding for 1 h in 10 % H2 in He. The operando CO2 methanation experiments were performed at 350, 400 &amp; 450 °C for 1h each with subsequent reoxidation at 500°C in synthetic air for 2h. Furthermore, the effect of H2 dropouts were tested by switching off the H2 supply several times for 1 h with subsequent methanation for 1 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The XAS-TPR runs show that the introduction of manganese leads to the formation of active metallic Ni sites at lower temperatures. XRD-TPR confirmed that the Ni0.9Mn1.75Al0.25O4 spinel structure is destroyed during reduction from 400°C and a new Ni0.25Mn0.75O1 phase is formed. In contrast in Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4 the supporting spinel structure stays intact. The H2 dropout experiments revealed no change in oxidation state or activity for any of the catalysts tested. The Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4 catalyst shows high redox cyclability, with Ni &amp; Mn K-edges, phase fractions (LCA analysis of XANES data) and methane yields that remain unchanged after multiple consecutive cycles of active site formation by reduction and active site reintegration by oxidation into the hosting spinel structure (c.f. figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This supports the possibility to reverse potential deactivation of the NiMnAl spinel catalyst. The supported NiMnx/Al2O3 and Ni0.9Mn1.75Al0.25O4 catalyst exhibits as expected low redox cyclability, with Ni &amp; Mn K-edges, phase fractions and methane yields that no longer reach the origin after one additional reoxidation cycle (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). These two sets of catalysts demonstrate our hypothesis, that a supporting stable spinel phase is necessary to allow for a dynamic creation and redispersion of active sites. In conventional supported systems this dynamic change is not possible. Based on these results two papers are in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A) Ni K-edge &amp; B) Mn K-edge of the oxidized and reduced Ni0.9Mn0.375Al1.625O4catalyst before and after the redox cycle.
