<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mauro Ghigo-Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera -Italy</head><p>Report: A large part of the experiment was dedicated to the X-ray characterization at 8 keV photon energy of a double-cone Wolter I approximation multilayer (11 bilayers -Ni/C stack, d-spacing = 46 Å, Γ = 0.5) optics with the following parameters: max &amp; min diameters =121.3 cm and 111.567 cm, total height = 300 cm, focal length = 185 cm. The mirror was realized by means of the direct multilayer replication process based on the Ni electroforming replication: an Al mandrel having the negative profile of the mirror to be realized is produced and coated with a thin (100 µm) layer of electroless Ni and then superpolished; afterwards the mandrel is mounted onto a rotational stage at the interior of a vacuum chamber where the multilayer film is deposited by ion-beam sputtering; the mandrel is then put into an electrolytic bath were a layer of Ni is electroformed to give a mechanical structure to the mirror. The Ni mirror shell with the multilayer attached is then separated from the mandrel by cooling it, exploiting the larger (roughly a factor 2) thermal expansion coefficient of the mandrel Al compared with the Ni mirror walls. This technique is derived from that successfully used for making the Au coated soft X-Ray mirrors of e.g. the XMM-Newton mission.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> The double-cone multilayer mirror mounted on the goniometer of the ESRF BM5 beamline A picture of the optics mounted on the BM5 goniometer is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The X-Ray tests were carried out at 8 Kev photon energy by means of a highly monochromatized (∆E/E = 1.6 x 10 -4 ) pencil beam (50 µm x 1 mm) with a low divergence (5 arcsec). The beam was addressed to impinge the internal surface of the first cone. In our measurements we started the scans at a sufficiently large reflection angle in order to avoid a further reflection from the second conical surface. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> it is shown the measured reflectivity profile until the 3 d Bragg peak, As can be noted the data are in good agreement with a model involving an average internal roughness of less than 7 Å.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2 Measured reflectivity profile</head><p>Diffuse scattering profiles were also performed around the first Bragg peak in both sample-scan geometry (detector fixed at the Bragg specular position and angular scanning with the sample stage) and detector-scan geometry (sample fixed at the Bragg position and scanning with the detector around the specular position). The two scattering profiles are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3 (A-B</ref>). The data were fitted using the IMD software assuming a Distorted-Wave Born Approximation scattering formalism. For the Power Spectral Density (PSD) at each interlayer we assumed the Stearn's model for a multilayer grown, which describes the PSD of each interlayer due to a contribution of both the initial substrate roughness and of the intrinsic roughness originated by the deposition process. The internal multilayer roughness value derived in this way is of 6.5 Å, and it is completely dominated from the substrate (i.e. the mandrel) contribution. It should be noted that the derived value not only corresponds to what found from the reflectivity data fitting but it is also in good agreement with the rms medium-frequency roughness measured on the mandrel roughness before the deposition.

Peverini, "Development of Soft and Hard X-ray optics for astronomy", SPIE Proc., 4138, in press (2000)</p><p>NB: The analysis of other data taken during the experiment onto different samples is currently going on.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3 Diffuse scattering profiles at 8 keV photon energy measured at ESRF for the multilayer double-cone optics realized using the mandrel SAX #12 around the first Bragg position A-Rocking scan; B-detector scan (see the text fore details)</figDesc><graphic coords="3,50.60,482.20,242.16,128.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
