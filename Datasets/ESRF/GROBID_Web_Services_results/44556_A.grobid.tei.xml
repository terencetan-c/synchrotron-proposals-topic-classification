<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The aim of the proposed experiment was to investigate the oxidation states and crystal structure of CeO 2 in CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts in redox and isothermal oxygen/propane reactions by an in-situ method, which combines X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ce K edge (~40 keV) with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and mass spectrometry (MS) and possibly Raman vibrational spectroscopy. By comparison of the two samples, the behaviour of ceria with and without CuO in the catalyst can be assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed</head><p>In view of optimal XAS signal, a sample of 20 to 40 mg was loaded between with 2 quartz wool plugs into a 3 mm quartz capillary, which fits into the capillary frame setup of SNBL, allowing in situ XAS, XRD and Raman measurements. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of Raman measurements at RT over both samples.  Good quality XAS spectra were obtained with Ce K edge EXAFS measurements up to k = 15 Å -1 at room temperature (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Gas-phase compositions were obtained, using a calibrated MS (Omnistar TM ). Typically, the reaction temperature varied between RT and 1000 K, with total flow rates of 40 ml/min. Powder reference materials CeO 2 , CeCl 3 and CeF 3 were measured in pellet form and in capillary with reference : BN dilution of 1 : 9. Thermal reduction as well as hydrogen and propane reduction experiments were performed on both samples at various temperatures. For the re-oxidation experiments, both O 2 and CO 2 were used as oxidant. Finally, isothermal reactions with O 2 :C 3 H 8 ratios of 5, 2 and 1 were followed.</p><p>Example experiments: reduction  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). The diffractions associated with CeO 2 (28 and 32°) display an increase in intensity as well as a small shift towards lower angle with increasing T. In the Ce K XANES spectra, also some small changes occur (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</p><p>In propane reduction, the XRD pattern for the same sample shows changes from T = 673 K on, i.e. before thermal reduction is at play (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). On the other hand, propane reduction of CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 shows no noticeable changes in XRD pattern up to 1073 K (not shown), indicating the reduction affects mainly CuO.</p><p>In H 2 reduction, XANES spectra from both samples show evidence of some reduction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Analysis of the data will allow to assess to which extent CeO 2 has suffered oxygen loss during reduction in both samples.  a b</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: averaged Raman scans over CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 and CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 at ambient conditions.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,38.40,586.32,247.32,182.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The diffractions associated with CeO 2 (28 and 32°) display an increase in intensity as well as a small shift towards lower angle with increasing T. In the Ce K XANES spectra, also some small changes occur (Fig.2b). In propane reduction, the XRD pattern for the same sample shows changes from T = 673 K on, i.e. before thermal reduction is at play (Fig.4). On the other hand, propane reduction of CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 shows no noticeable changes in XRD pattern up to 1073 K (not shown), indicating the reduction affects mainly CuO. In H 2 reduction, XANES spectra from both samples show evidence of some reduction (Fig.5). Analysis of the data will allow to assess to which extent CeO 2 has suffered oxygen loss during reduction in both samples.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,66.48,180.84,195.00,175.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
