<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the last few years our group has undertaken an ongoing research program in the characterization of alkali-metal exchanged zeolites, mainly using infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules <ref type="bibr">[l-7]</ref>. In November 1995 we have performed at GILDA D8 beamline of ESRF, an EXAFS study on Rb-exchanged zeolites to characterize the local Rb environment (see corresponding exp. report). The aim of the present work is to localize cation sites in Rb-exchanged Y zeolites and to study the cation migration upon interaction with strong ligands like Hz0 and NHj. To fulfill this request a total control of the sample atmosphere is fundamental. We have thus prepared an ad hoc cell able to activate the sample under dynamical vacuum up to 700 K and to locate the so dehydrated sample in a boron silicate capillary used for XRD measurements; if desired a known amount of pure adsorbate can be dosed before the capillary occlusion. To minimize the sample absorptions XRD measurements have been performed just before the Rb k, edge, using h= 0.8497 A. The XRD pattern has been collected up to 20 = 67" (d = 0.75 A) using a continuous scan acquisition mode with a scan speed progressively decreased at high 28 to increase the counts statistic. We were able to collect at RT three spectra: in vacuum,+H20 and +NHj. The data analysis has been performed by Rietveld method included in GSAS software package. As the observed spectra show a bump due to the amorphous scattering from the capillary, we havechosen an angular range for the refinement from 7° to 67° . Starting from structure data of Na-Y zeolite (space group l%3m) [8] we have identified two extraframework sites for Rb' cations (sites II and I') and one for unexchanged Na+ cations (site I) with refined occupancies.</p><p>Even if for all the samples a good agreament between measured and refined data has been obtained, the here presented results must be considered as preliminary. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the refinement of the spectrum collected in vacuum, while Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the Fourier map of the n the observed and the calculated structure factors centered in the II Rb iminary results from this experiment will be presented next days at <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. We are indebted with al the D16 staff which has enabled us to work under optimal conditions and particularly with Gavin Vaughan for sophisticated data binning.</p></div>		</body>
