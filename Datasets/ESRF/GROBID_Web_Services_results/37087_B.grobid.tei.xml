<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment we have examined three different Np compounds, all with the same cubic fcc Laves crystal structure (C15), namely NpAl2, NpFe2 and NpOs2. All are ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of 56K, &gt;300K, 10K respectively and have a magnetic moment of 1.22 µ B /f.u., 3.20 µ B /f.u., 0.60 µ B /f.u. These materials have been chosen because NpAl2 is considered a localised system, whereas NpOs2 is itinerant. In NpFe2 there is evidence of strong hybridisation between Np and Fe atoms. All samples have been prepared at ITU, Karlsruhe, and have been carefully characterized structurally and magnetically by means of X-ray Diffraction and SQUID magnetometry. The macroscopic magnetic properties of the sample measured are in excellent agreement to those published earlier [see. <ref type="bibr">Aldred et al., PRB 10 (1974</ref><ref type="bibr">) 1011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aldred et al., PRB 14 (1976</ref><ref type="bibr">) 1276;</ref><ref type="bibr">Aldred et al., PRB 11 (1975) 530]</ref>. All Np based compounds have been encapsulated in especially designed sample holder of Cu covered with beryllium and Kapton windows. All safety procedures were respected and no problems were encountered during the setup and measurements.</p><p>As written in our proposal, we have successfully carried out all the proposed measurements. For the first time, an XMCD signal at the Np M 4,5 -edge in ferromagnetic NpAl 2 , NpFe 2 and NpOs 2 have been measured. As expected, the observed dichroic signal is larger at the M4 compared to the M5 absorption edge but to a lesser extent than in U based ferromagnets. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> show the XAS and the corresponding XMCD signal recorded at the Np M5 and M4-edges in NpFe 2 and NpOs 2 . We observe a strong dichroic signal with a similar spectral shape for the two compounds. The site and orbital selectivity, typical of absorption spectroscopy, together with the existence of sum rules, will allow us to calculate the expectation value of the Np 5f orbital magnetic moment of the ground state from the XMCD experimental spectra. Even the expectation value of the Np 5f spin magnetic moment of the ground state can be evaluated, if a reasonable approximation of the dipolar moment can be provided. The study of the branching ratio can therefore bring valuable information regarding the coupling scheme which best describes the Np electronic and magnetic properties, within which to discuss the actinides and therefore implies a different weighting of the dipolar contribution compared to the spin one. Work is in progress regarding the evaluation of the different magnetic moment contributions.</p><p>We have also measured an XMCD signal at the Fe K-edge in NpFe 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) that will be compared to the XMCD signal recorded in UFe 2 (same Laves phase structure). We have observed a large influence of the strong Np spin-orbit interaction on the XMCD signal that is essentially located in the pre-edge peak. Finally, a sizeable XMCD signal up to 2% with respect to the edge jump at the Os L2,3-edges has been measured in NpOs 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) implying the existence of a finite Os 5d induced magnetic moment. Using the sum rules, it would be possible to determine individually the spin and orbital magnetic moment induced by Np. We can already say that the 5d spin moment is aligned parallel to the Np total moment. A theoretical effort based on fully relativistic band structure calculations on both Np and Os sites is under progress.
