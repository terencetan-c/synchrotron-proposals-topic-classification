<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Rationale: MD438 and MD531 beamtime allocations allowed us to investigate the effects of synchrotron-generated interlaced MRT coupled to pink-beam imaging on the GAERS rat. Since recent data had shown that absence seizures arise within the somatosensory cortex before they diffuse to the rest of the cortex and the thalamus, we irradiated this cortical region bilaterally using 4 interlaced ports of 50µm-wide microbeams resulting in a homogenous dose of 200Gy into the targeted areas. This procedure resulted in a 50% reduction of the seizure duration compared to sham animals that appeared as soon as 3 weeks after irradiation and was still significant after five months. Histological and electrophysiological data suggest that this effect is not mediated through simple tissue necrosis, but probably via a disruption of the local cellular network, which prevents the neurons from hypersynchronizing and generating epileptic discharges, without impairing their ability to perform their physiological tasks. This non-destructive effect of MRT becomes extremely suitable when seizures originate from a brain structure with a critical role like the hippocampus -the structure most commonly involved in pharmacoresistant MTLE. In order to address the applicability of MRT on MTLE, we propose to investigate its effects on a predictive and drug-resistant model of MTLE obtained after intrahippocampal injection of kainate in the mouse. This mouse model was preferred to the one developed in the rat because of the stability and recurrence of the seizures over a long time period, (ii) the resistance to several anti-epileptic drugs and because (iii) intracellular recordings were recently collected by our group in this model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>Most of the mice (8 out of 9) were successfully rendered epileptic with kainate injection in the right hippocampus. However, most of the animals still had seizures 1,5 months after 200Gy irradiation. In only 2 out of 8 epileptic mice we obseved a disappearence of hippocampal seizures. We suggest that the conformation of the irradiation must be improved. For the next round we propose to use variable microbeam sizes for the different port, in order to better match the complex shape of the hippocampus. As of September 2012, histology on harvested brains is being performed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Jean Laissue -Institute of Pathology Bern Tanguy Chabrol* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Antoine Depaulis* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Elke Brauer-Krisch* -ESRF Raphael Serduc* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Benoit Pouyatos* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 François Estève -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Report:</figDesc></figure>
