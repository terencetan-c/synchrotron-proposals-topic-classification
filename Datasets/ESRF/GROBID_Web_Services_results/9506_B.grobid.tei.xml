<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During this beam-time we have performed 3 different experiments; (1) We extended the PVT equation of state (EOS) of MgSiO3 pcrovskrtc up to 86 GPa and to 2700 K (2) WC checked the mrrcnce of the orthorhombic poiymorph of iron at high P and T, using either SiO2 or Al203 as pressure transmitting medium, and Re or W as gasket material (3) We performed preliminary experitnents on PVT-EOS of MgCI pcriclaac, which can be considered as the second major constituent. of the Earth's lower mantle.</p><p>The experiments were carried out using a high power YAG multimode laser combined with a diamond-anvil cell. The use of this laser-type allows heating al higher pressure than the previously used CO2 lawr, but the experiments claims for a smaller X-ray beam, compatible in size with that of the hot spot (about IS pm).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Integrated diffraction patterns of Fe in SiO, pressure medium, and using a W-gasket at 35 OPa. Upon cold compression (bottom spectrum), all e-hcp Iron diffraction lines are visible, and there is no SiO,feature because quartz has become amorphous. The top spectrum was recorded after several laser-heating sequences. No oxidation of the iron-sample was encountered, since all diffraction peaks can be indexed as a mixture of iron and stishovite (* stands for tnet.asl;rble g-fcc iron, quenched on cooling).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>nzsults on PVT-EOS of Mea:</head><p>The are several interests in the study of pcriclasc at high P and T, It is the second major constituent of the Earth's lower man&amp;, and thus its PVT-EOS is needed to produce accumte mineralogical model for the deep Earth. MgO is ofton used as a reference in various highuseful solid solution to analyse the effect of iron on the elastic behavior of the MgO-rich minerals. X-ray diffraction pattern have thus been recorded in situ at high-pressure and high-tempcraturc, on a mixture of MgO and platinum, loaded cryogenically in argon. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows an example of diffraction pattern, after collection and integration of an imaging plate exposed 120 s at a wavclcngth of 0.4247 A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2:</head><p>In this expcrimcnt, the sample was compressed at 16.7 GPa while heated with a CO, infrared laser at around 1900 K, as determined by the analysis of the sample thermal emission. Such results, however, need to be extended to higher pressures and more investigations arc n&amp;cd to a slightly enriched iron composition, in order to identify correctly a nzliable set of thermoclastic parameters</p></div>		</body>
