The prposed work was aimed to explore the chemical state and local atomic displacements in this derivative Ag x Pb 6 CO 9 with respect to the parent compounds PbCO 3 (cerussite, existing orthorhombic structure) PbO, PbO 2 , Pb 2 O 3 and Pb 3 O 4 , using high resolution Pb L-edge absorption measurements to distinguish the specialities.</p><p>During the assigned beamtime, we could measure high resolution Pb L-edge XANES to investigate the instantaneous local structure and the local density of states in powder samples of PbCO 3 (cerussite, existing orthorhombic structure) PbO, PbO 2 , Pb 2 O 3 and Pb 3 O 4 and Ag x Pb 6 CO 9 system. The measurements were made at low temperature using 13 element fluorescence detector. As a usual routine, the emphasis was to obtain the absorption data with high signal to noise ratio and for that several scans were collected to limit the noise level to the order of 10 -4 .</p><p>A preliminary analysis to the XANES data show that the electronic states near the Fermi level in the title system appears quite similar to the one for the PbCO 3 (cerussite), however, the local environment is slightly different, as evidenced by multiple scattering analysis of the Pb L-edge XANES. Detailed analysis of the experimental spectra and interpretaion of different spectral features by calculations of the Pb L-edge XANES using the full multiple scattering theory is underway.</p><p>A part of the beamtime was used for a study of local structure of Nb 3 Ge intermetallic superconductor by the Ge K-edge absorption spectroscopy. The temperature dependent measurements were made using fluerescence detection mode. Standard procedure was used to extract the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) signal and corrected for the x-ray fluorescence self-absorption before the analysis. The EXAFS analysis shows two Ge-Nb distances, i.e., in addition to the crystallographic distance of ~2.88 , there exists a second Ge-Nb distance, shorter by ~0.2 from the average one, assigned to a phase with short range symmetry related to local displacements in the Nb-Nb chains. The X-ray absorption nearedge structure (XANES) spectrum has been simulated by full multiple-scattering calculations considering the local displacements determined by the EXAFS analysis. The XANES spectrum could be well reproduced by considering a cluster of 99 atoms within a radius of about 7 from the central Ge atom, and introducing the determined local displacements (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The XANES results are found to be consistent with the EXAFS findings confirming a coexisting phase without any long-range crystallographic symmetry due to local displacements in the Nb-Nb chains, in addition to the normal crystallographic structure. The results are being communicated for the publication.</p><p>Due to insufficient time, the measurements on the Nb 3 Ge were performed only at low temperature. The temperature dependent measurements are due to explore the interplay of inhomogeneous state and superconductivity of this system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
