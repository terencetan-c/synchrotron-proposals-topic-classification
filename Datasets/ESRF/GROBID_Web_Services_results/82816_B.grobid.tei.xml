<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The initial objective of the proposal was to study the effect of post-growth annealing on structural properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MoSe2/WSe2 grown on sapphire substrate. During the first shifts of the beam time, we found that the TMDs grew in an inhomogenous manner on the substrate without any preferential crystallographic orientations and the post-anneal did not help to rearrange the domains. The study with synchrotron diffraction was meaningless on this system. For this reason, we have dedicated the rest of our time shifts to study vertically 2D heterostructure based on TMDs and graphene, which is also an attractive structure for exloring new physics in the 2D system. We aimed to characterize the structural properties of the top layer MoSe2 and to unveil the van der Waals epitaxial registry between the TMDs layer and graphene-SiC, which has been so far not reported yet. In the main part of the present report, we focus, therefore, only on the results obtained with the heterostructure MoSe2/Graphene-SiC.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an in-plane reciprocal space map (rsm) measured on the 3.5 ML sample, covering one sixth of the =0 reciprocal plane, and indexed using the SiC(0001) reciprocal lattice units. The map measured on the 0.75 ML and 1 ML samples are very similar, with weaker intensities. In addition to the reciprocal space map, very precise radial scans were performed along the high symmetry directions (h00) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and (hh0) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>), as well as precise rocking scans (see e.g. Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), and measurements as a function of along the rods of scattering on all measurable Bragg peaks/rings (see e.g. Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).  was varied by increasing the exit angle with respect to the surface while keeping the incident angle fixed.</p><p>The diffraction from three hexagonal lattices is clearly visible on the in-plane rsm: the hardly visible peaks of the SiC(0001) substrate; the peaks from the multilayer graphene grown on it also hardly visible, and finally and those of the MoSe2 thin layer, in the form of wide, in-plane textured, rings of scattering. No other feature is visible.</p><p>The position of these peaks (together with out-off plane ones, not shown), yields the following epitaxial relationships: SiC[10-10](0001)//Gr[1-100](0001)//MoSe2[1-100](0001). This finding indicates that the in-plane lattices of graphene and MoSe2 commensurately align to each other, whereas the SiC substrate lattice rotates an angle of 30° with respect to the two adjacent overlayers.</p><p>The exact lattice parameters of the multilayer graphene and of MoSe2 were deduced by fitting the positions of the corresponding Bragg peaks along radial scans. The widths of these peaks were also used to estimate the in-plane domain size according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q) 2 = (2/ D) 2 + Q 2 (a/a) 2 ,</formula><p>Where Q is the peaks Full Width at Half Maximum FWHM in nm -1 : D is the domain size (nm), Q the reciprocal space location (or momentum transfer (nm -1 ) and a/a the FWHM of a possible inhomogeneous distribution of in-plane lattice parameter. A linear evolution of the MoSe2 peak width with Q was indeed found, revealing a distribution of in-plane lattice parameter, i.e. some inhomogeneous strain.</p><p>The in-plane mosaic spreads were deduced from rocking scan measurements across the graphene and MoSe2 peaks. No evolutions were found with varying momentum transfer Q, thus showing the peak widths are completely dominated by in-plane mosaic spread.</p><p>The out-off plane thickness and structure, and in particular the stacking sequence, were determined by simulating the rods of scattering by the MoSe2 layer. The position of the out-off plane allowed and forbidden Bragg peaks allowed to unambiguously demonstrated that the MoSe2 layer is of 1H (2H) structure. Note that these fits yield a 3 to 4 % expansion of the MoSe2 inter-plane distances perpendicular to the surface.</p><p>The structural parameters deduced from the different X-ray measurements are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>From this study, it was found that crystallographic directions of the MoSe2 lattice align perfectly along the ones of the graphene lattice, resulting in only one commensurate configuration. This reveals a novel feature of the vdW epitaxy where the vdW interaction between the two layers was revised. The latter guides all domains of the MoSe2 layer orienting along the graphene. This finding suggests the unique configuration of epitaxial registry between MoSe2 and graphene which enables for orientation-independent investigation of heterostructure properties without anisotropic effect.

The thickness deduced from the fits of out-of plan rods is almost nominal. The thicker (3.5 ML) sample yields different results, though. The average in-plane lattice parameter is much larger, as is its distribution, about 10 times larger.
