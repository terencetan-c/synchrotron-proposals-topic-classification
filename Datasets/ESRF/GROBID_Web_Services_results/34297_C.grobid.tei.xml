<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This report is the second year report of Long Term Project MD238, where 90 shifts were granted for 2 years. The proposal was accepted originally for the beamtime allocation periods 2006/II -2008/I. Due to reconstruction of ID17, the use of beamtime was delayed by one year, and so far 62 shifts have been used: 30 in 2006/II, 17 in 2007/I, 15 in 2008/II. Accordingly, 2 experiments of 15 and 13 shifts remain to be carried out in 2009.</p><p>In the first and second year total 4 of the 6 experiments were performed and 62 of the 90 shifts were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beamline</head><p>Shifts Start Date Finish Date Local Contact ID17 15 MD238/1 07 December 2006 12 December 2006 Dr. Christian NEMOZ ID17 15 MD238/2 05 February 2007 12 February 2007 Dr. Christian NEMOZ ID17 17 MD238/3 11 July 2007 16 July 2007 Dr. Christian NEMOZ ID17 15 MD238/4 04 December 2008 09 December 2008 Dr. Christian NEMOZ Background and aim of the study: Traditional measurements of lung function such as spirometry can at best provide overall assessments and do not give any insight into the localization and heterogeneity of airway response. We have introduced a novel CT imaging technique that uses synchrotron radiation to quantitatively image inhaled stable xenon gas within the airways with a high spatial resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bayat et al 2006)</ref>. Using this method, regional lung volume, ventilation, and airway luminal diameters down to 2 mm can be measured. The spatial resolution of this technique is the best available for regional ventilation imaging in small animals, and the structure of the lungs can be studied simultaneously.</p><p>K-edge subtraction (KES) imaging and Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT) were combined in all MD238 experiments. KES provides high-resolution images of lung structure and ventilation distributions, and the frequency-dependent impedance of lung, as measured by FOT, provides physiological parameters of lung biomechanics. Simultaneous observations by KES and FOT yield a comprehensive picture of lung function.</p><p>Imaging setup is presented in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Methacholine challenge (Mch) is routinely used as non-specific challenge to diagnose bronchial hyperreactivity, although its effect in the lungs and main airways as compared to a specific allergen challenge are not precisely known. Mch provocation was studied in first 2 experiments of the LTP project MD238/1 and 2. The aim of these studies was to use new asthma model using sensitized rabbits, and compare images obtained with synchrotron radiation with results on overall lung mechanics obtained with the forced oscillation technique (FOT) <ref type="bibr">(Petak et al, 2006)</ref>. This animal model was used to study first the effect of Mch in the lungs, and compare the results to the effects of allergen provocation, and the results were compared to the results from healthy animals <ref type="bibr">(Strengell et al, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Tobacco smoke is an increasing health problem in the world, and more information about the acute effects of tobacco smoke in the lungs is needed. The effect of acute tobacco smoke was studied in the third experiment MD238/3, where the effects of previous smoke provocation on the subsequent Mch provocation were studied <ref type="bibr">(Janosi et al, 2009)</ref>. More detailed summary can be found in first year report of MD238 ( <ref type="formula">2007</ref>).</p><p>Studies of small animals are important lines of future research. In addition to development of whole-lung and 3D imaging, studies of transgenic mice are important for separation of expressions of hereditary and induced diseases. The methods of mechanical ventilation and physiological monitoring in KES+FOT experiments were developed for rabbits, and first trials of applying the methods in rats and mice have been carried out in the 4 th experiment MD238/4.</p><p>Experiment MD238/4: This experiment concentrated mainly on technical development using small animals (3 rats, 7 mice) and high-resolution FReLoN detector (50µm pixel size). Ventilator setup and animal holder were modified to be suitable for smaller animals, and images were acquired at baseline and after Mch aerosol provocation (figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> and <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). All results will be fully analyzed and published later.</p><p>Offline experiments: 2 offline experiments were performed in Geneva University Central hospital to complete the results obtained from cigarette exposure study (MD238/3). Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of a particle phase, containing multiple components including nicotine, and a gas phase containing NO and CO, both of which are bronchodilators.The combined KES+FOT experiments were completed by off-line FOT experiments where the animals were exposed to the gas phase of cigarette smoke, NO, CO, IV nicotine, among other mediators. Although some bronchodilatation was observed with NO, and CO, the delayed inhibitory effect of cigarette smoke exposure on airway reactivity in this species could only partially be reproduced by the smoke gas phase. Inter-species differences in the response to cigarette smoke hold great promise in the understanding of the machanisms of the toxic effects of cigarette smoke on airway function. Experiments were performed with the same ventilator setup used at the ESRF, and lung mechanics were measured with FOT system. Rabbits were exposed with HEPA -filtered cigarette smoke, alpha-chymotrypsine, nicotine, NO and CO gases, and the results were compared with the earlier results with non-filtered smoke.
