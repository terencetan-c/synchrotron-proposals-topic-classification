<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this initiative is the establishment of a structural biology centre of high international standard for determination and analysis of the 3D-structures of biologically active macromolecules. In addition to taking part in projects nationwide as an external collaborator, NORSTRUCT has been given the opportunity to initiate and develop internal projects at the centre. Our involvement in external projects range from consultancy to full scale structure determination and structure-function analysis, including hosting project workers for training and providing access to facilities.</p><p>Internal projects at NORSTRUCT focus on proteins expressed by the fish pathogenic bacteria Vibrio salmonicida and enzymes involved in the defence systems of Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon, and with a structural genomics approach to virulence factors and defence molecules of the model organisms. "Structural genomics studies of Vibrio salmonicida", is one part of a more comprehensive project on this psychrophilic and pathogenic bacteria, also including genome sequencing and cellular/functional studies. The structural part of the project is divided into sub-groups based on functional aspects of the proteins. A) "Structurefunction relation studies of proteins involved in oxidative stress", B) "Structure-function relation studies of nucleases", C) "Structure-function studies of DNA repair proteins", D) "Structure-function studies of hypothetical proteins", and E) "Structure determination of virulence factors expressed by V. salmonicida".</p><p>External projects originate both in the academic society in Norway and in the biotecnology industry, and include nucleases and DNA binding proteins, phosphatases, isocitrate dehydrogenases and several other proteins of academic and commercial interest. The majority of the projects are the subject of structure-function-relation studies, where one seeks to increase the the knowledge about the relationship between structure and biophysical properties such as specificity, efficiency and stability. Succeding structure determination several of the proteins will be the target of redesign of one or more such properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Six shifts were allocated for three projects: MX308 Structure study of DNase from shrimp MX309</p><p>Structure studies of three glycosylated proteins from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) MX310</p><p>Crystallographic studies of lactate oxidase from Aerococcus viridans Data were collected 16-17.09.04 and 06-07.12.04.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure studies of DNase from shrimp</head><p>Recombinant DNase from shrimp is produced in Pichia Pastoris. New crystals of DNase were obtained from the same conditions as previously reported (MX253; 14 -16% PEG 6K, 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 5 and 2mM WO 4 2-) but from microbatch experiments instead of hanging drops. The crystals were still thin plates of approximate size ca 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.01 mm 3 . The crystals did not diffract as well as in the previous experiment (2.6Å instead of 2.2Å). The crystal morphology appear to have changed and the space group was monoclinic P21 with cell parameters 49.25 x 51.90 x 84.53 mm3 and β = 96.50. Apparently the length of the c-axis is half of what was observed previously, and the β-angle had changed.</p><p>One MAD data set with detector edge at 2.2Å was collected at the W L-III edge at the peak, inflection point and at the remote, and one SAD data set was collected on a different crystal. The first scan of the MAD data gave R sym of ca 10%, completeness of ca 99, I/σI of ca 6 and anomalous completeness of 90%. The statistics gets slightly worse for the two other scans. The SAD data gave R sym of ca 13, completeness of ca 98%, I/σI of ca 4, anonomalous completeness of ca 96% and multiplicity of ca 8. The anomalous signals in both datasets (according to xprep) were at best weak, and phasing has not been successful yet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure studies of three glycosylated proteins from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)</head><p>The proteins were purified from salmon liver. The crystals of protein A grow from ca 20% PEG 2K and 0.1 acetate buffer at pH 4.5. The crystals are of approximate size 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 mm 3 , and diffract to ca 2 -2.5 Å at ESRF. The protein is co-crystallized with heavy atoms such as W, Yb and Hg.</p><p>Crystals cocrystallized from all three heavy atoms were tested. The best data was collected at the L-III edge of Yb. The crystal diffracted to about 2.8Å. Initial indexing suggested the space group to be P21 with cell parameters of ca 81 x 164 x 81 mm 3 and β=108. However, recent reprocessing of the data suggest that the space group is C2221 with cell parameters of 94 x 132 x 164 mm 3 , and anomalous signals is found in xprep. The data is now subjected to further analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crystallographic studies of lactate oxidase from Aerococcus viridans</head><p>Several crystals were tested the first period and the best crystals diffracted to about 2.5 -3 Å. The diffraction patterns were, however, of such quality that the crystals could not be indexed. This was the only protein collected on the second period, and several data sets, both at cryogenic temperature and room temperature, were collected. The data have not been processet though, because the PhD student responsible for this has been away on leave of absence for two months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other</head><p>Crystals of alcaline phosphatase (TAB5) from the Antarctic strain TAB5 were tested. The crystals were thin sheets that diffracted to ca 2.3 Å in one direction and ca 3 on the other. The data were not of such quality that the structure could be solved by molecular replacement, and the anomalous signal was weak. Better data has been collected in experiment MX372 MopE is a protein involved in copper haemostasis. Crystals had been obtained from 2.0 M ammunium sulfate and 0.1 M acetate buffer at pH 4.6. Native data were collected to 2.7Å. The space group was C2 with cell parameters of ca 105.41 x 101.63 x 38.77 mm 3 and β = 101.76. R sym was ca 13%, I/σI ca 3.5 and ca 99% completeness. More data was collected in experiment MX368</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>laboratory at the University of Tromsø has been regular user of ESRF for many years. Over the years this has resulted in more than 40 publications and a considerable number of PhDs and MScs. The Norwegian Structural Biology Centre (NORSTRUCT) is administrated by the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tromsø, and was established in 2002 through a national initiative in functional genomics in Norway.</figDesc></figure>
