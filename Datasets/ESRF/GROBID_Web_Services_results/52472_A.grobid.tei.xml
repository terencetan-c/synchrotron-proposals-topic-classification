<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>In biomineralization processes, organism use biological mechanism in order to control polymorph formation. As part of the effort to understand this phenomenon, we incorporate aminoacids, as they are the foundation elements for proteins, into the most abundant mineral on earth, calcium carbonate. One of the most interesting reactions between the amino acid and the mineral is the interaction between the sulphur atom in the cysteine and methionine aminoacids. In this experiment, we want understand how the aminoacid interacts with the carbonate in the different phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental:</head><p>Three polymorphs of calcium carbonate, calcite, aragonite and vetarite, where crystalized with cysteine and methionine aminoacids and were examined by using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) monitoring the sulphur K-edge at ID26 beamline by using a crystal spectrometer. The scanned energy range was 2450-2650 eV. The spectroscopy measurements were conducted under vacuum conditions. During the data collection, some pure phases bearing Sulphur cations with different valence were used as references to interpret the sample's spectra:</p><p>--Organic Phases: Cysteine and Melatonin --Inorganic S -2 : CaS and ZnS --Inorganic Sulphate (SO 4 2-): CaSO 4 and ZnSO 4 The spectra of CaCO 3 samples crystallized with cysteine or methionine were compared with the reference spectra to understand the sulphur coordination and valence state after the crystallization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The experimental spectra of the calcium carbonate with Methionine and Cysteine are reported in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> respectively. For the pictures, it is possible to highlight some occurrences:</p><p>--The sulphur oxides CaSO 4 is present in all samples except in the vetarite with cysteine --Unreacted methionine is always present in all three samples crystallized with this aminoacid --In the spectra of vetarite sample there is a strong peak 2475 eV that is difficult to attribute to a specific phase, but it seems to the due to a phase with sulphur charge between -2 and 6 --The aragonite with cysteine spectra shows that sulphur is partially unreacted in cysteine and partially oxidized to CaSO 4 . --Calcite and vetarite with cysteine show that the peak of Sulphur atom in the aminoacid is split, suggesting a possible reaction of this molecule with the Ca 2+ cation. The chemical consequence of these result are still under analysis A B C Figure 1 CaCO 3 with Cystein, red Cystein spectra, black CaSO 4 spectra, green A Calcite, B Aragonite, C Veterite spectra</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 Figure 1</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Figure 2 CaCO 3 with Methionin, red Methion spectra, black CaSO 4 spectra, green A Calcite, B Aragonite, C Veterite spectra</figDesc><graphic coords="2,3.62,250.34,313.44,200.64" type="bitmap" /></figure>
