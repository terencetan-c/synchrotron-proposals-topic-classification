Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the samples characterized during this experiment and their main characteristics.</p><p>In our experiments, Cu filter was used to diminish the emission coming from the substrate. Therefore, we couldn't make direct correlation between the chemical composition and the XRF intensity from In and Sb species. However, it gave us an idea on the uniformity along long regions Two representative XRF maps from GaAsSb nanomembranes (NMs) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It can be observed that at the junction where membranes unite, there is an increase in the Sb concentration. This is mostly as a result of overgrowth, since more material accumulates at the junction during growth. This is also present in our SEM images. During GaAsSb growth, we used 10% of As partial pressure as Sb pressure which we obtained the most uniform structures. However, we believe this corresponds to less than 10% atomic percent present in the structures.</p><p>Depending on the crystal direction, uniformity of In changes.  a) b) c)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: XRF Sb-Ka maps of GaAsSb nanomembrane junctions.

In sumamry, XRF mapping on ID16B allowed us to study the uniformity in the Sb and In incorporation into the GaAs membranes and InAs nanowires, respectively. This results will be used to optimize the growth conditions looking to obtain homogeneous InAs nanowires for application in quantum computing.</figDesc></figure>
