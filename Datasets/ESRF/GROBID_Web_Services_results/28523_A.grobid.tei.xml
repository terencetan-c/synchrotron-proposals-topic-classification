<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We were allocated 9 shifts to carry out two studies of the cornea. The first study was to radially scan from cornea to sclera at 45 degree angles (8 scans) and the second was to examine strips of cornea edge-on to study collagen orientation as a function of depth within the cornea. The aim was to build up a three-dimensional model of collagen orientation to understand how the change of curvature is maintained at the limbus, where the cornea and sclera join.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The time allocated was quite late in the year when Dr. Riekel was in Manchester. As a consequence, he had to ask Dr. Burghammer to take his place as our contact, because it was not possible for us to reschedule. Unfortunately, there were a number of problems setting the camera length to clearly resolve the required collagen reflection from our corneas. These problems meant that it was not until the fifth shift that we started to get useable data. The problems were both technical and also were related to our test specimens, which were slightly swollen. However, Dr. Burghammer worked incredibly hard, including most of the night, to make sure we got what we needed, and once we got going, we obtained excellent data.</p><p>Because of these problems, we only managed to complete the first experiment. However, the data we have obtained should be unique, because they have come from two eyes from the same donor. The normal procedures at the Eye Bank mean that it is very rare to obtain two corneas from the same person, and even rarer to get these corneas tagged so that their orientation is known when positioned in the x-ray beam. At Daresbury, we mapped these corneas at low resolution and found that the corneal structure is not circularly symmetrical. However, there are interesting symmetries between the left and right corneas. At ESRF we used 1mm steps radially from the centre for 3mm, then 25 micron steps across the sclera into the limbus. We managed to complete the data collection for both eyes (16 radial scans). We have started to analyse the huge amount of data, but it will be several months before the analysis is complete. To use the short time whilst Dr. Boote was sleeping, we took a twodimensional raster scan across a mouse cornea and limbus. (The mouse cornea is not yet characterised structurally, but is the model used in a great number of studies. Because of its small size, the microfocus beam is ideal for this work, and we intend to put in a separate proposal to examine the mouse cornea in more detail).</p></div>		</body>
