<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this project was to study the microstructure of nanocavities (size, shape, arrangement, depth distribution) formed after implantation in semiconductors. Grazing incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments have been perfomed on the D2AM beamline at 8950 eV using a 2D CCD detector fixed in front of the direct beam. The beamsize was 0.5×0.1 mm 2 and the angle of incidence α i was varied from 0.3° to 0.5° in order to characterize the depth profile of the cavities from the near surface to deeply buried regions up to 1 µm. The influence of the implantation parameters on the formation of the nanocavities has been studied through the analysis of 3 types of samples:</p><p>-Si(001) implanted with He ions (50 keV, 5×10 16 He + .cm -2 ) at different temperatures (200-600 °C) subjected to further annealing at 400, 600, and 800 °C.</p><p>-Si(001) implanted with Ne ions (50 keV) at different fluences (0.1-5×10 16 cm -2 ) and different temperatures (250-800 °C) -SiC implanted with He ions (50 keV, 300 °C) at different fluences (3-10×10 16 cm -2 )</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Helium implantation in silicon</head><p>As a typical example, figure 1(a) shows the GISAXS pattern of a Si(001) sample implanted with He ions at 200 °C and annealed at 600 °C for 1h. The angle of incidence was α i = 0.4° and the incident x-ray beam was parallel to the [110] direction (ϕ = 0°).</p><p>Furthermore, the length of the sample (30 mm) was adjusted in order to be able to perform absolute intensity measurements. An isotropic scattering signal without interference maximum is clearly seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), indicating a random distribution of spherical cavities with average size of about 5 nm as deduced from a simple Guinier plot. The quantitative analysis of the experimental data is under progress and will permit to determine the evolution of the volume occupied by the cavities as a function of the annealing temperature.</p><p>In contrast, the GISAXS pattern of a Si(001) sample implanted with He ions at 600 °C [figure 1(b)]) shows diffuse rods oriented at 54.7° from the surface normal (corresponding to &lt;111&gt; directions) and intense rods oriented at 25.2°, i.e. along &lt;113&gt; directions. To study the symmetry properties of the corresponding scattering objects, experiments at different azimuthal angles ϕ have been performed [see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c)</ref>]. The results reveal the existence of {111} facets on the cavities and the presence of {113} defects of ribbon-like type.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Neon implantation in silicon</head><p>It is worth noting that neither facetting of the cavities nor formation of {113} defects was observed for neon implantations. On the other hand, no GISAXS signal was detected for fluences lower than 2×10 16 Ne + .cm -2 . As examples, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Helium implantation in silicon carbide</head><p>While no GISAXS signal was detected at 3×10 16 He + .cm -2 , a diffuse ring characteristics of very small (&lt; 1.5 nm) cavities with a short-range ordering (intercavity distance around 3 nm) was observed at 1×10 17 He + .cm -2 in SiC. In conclusion, our experiments clearly show the capabilities of the GISAXS technique combined with the synchrotron brilliance for the study of buried defects induced by implantation in Si and SiC.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) GISAXS pattern of Si(001) implanted at 200 °C and annealed at 600 °C for 1h with α i = 0.4°.
