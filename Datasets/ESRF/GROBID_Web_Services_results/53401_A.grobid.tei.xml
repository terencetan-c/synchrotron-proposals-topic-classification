<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of this study is to describe a well-known system, a Co/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, to showcase the potential of using XRD-CT to study cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.</p><p>A 3 mm cylindrical pellet of a 10 wt. % Co/Al 2 O 3 catalyst prepared by the impregnation of a γ-Al 2 O 3 support with a cobalt solution followed by drying and calcination at 300 o C for 4h (ref C1414501).Reduction was performed under 39 ml/min of H 2 from room temperature to 450 °C with a ramp of 2°C/min with steps of 60 min at 150 °C, 310 °C, 350 °C and 420 °C. Fisher-Tropsh synthesis (FTS) was performed at 250 °C under CO (5 %, 20 ml/min), H 2 (100 %, 2 ml/min) and He (100 %, 19 ml/min). The experiment was designed to obtain 2 dimensional information on the formation of cobalt phases within a catalyst body during reduction and FTS. This necessitated mounting the catalyst body in a quartz cell with a gas delivery connector. The latter was fixed to a goniometer attached to a rotation stage. This entire setup itself was mounted upon a translation stage, onto which were also mounted two heat guns. This experiment was carried out at station ID15A using a high energy monochromatic, 50 µm square section pencil beam. For each time slice, diffraction was recorded at 70 translations spaced 50 µm across the body each with 60 rotations of 3°, corresponding to 4200 projections. Each diffraction pattern was recorded for 500 ms. Powder ring data were obtained and these were radially integrated for each diffraction "projection". For each observed intensity in these radially integrated patterns, a sinogram was constructed and then back-projected to a 66 x 66 pixel image.</p><p>Through the reduction and FTS on the Co/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, three cobalt phases are observable: Co 3 O 4 , CoO and Co fcc. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows two diffractograms of the cobalt species at the beginning of the reduction at 150 °C (slide #002) and at the end of the experiment (slide #032) with the three cobalt species clearly observable. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the reconstructed images of those cobalt phases at four steps of the experiment. At the beginning of the reduction process (150 °C), the catalyst presents two cobalt phases. Some CoO is visible at the outer part of the pellet while Co 3 O 4 , the predominant phase, is present throughout the catalyst with two rings of higher intensity (on the outer circumference and within the pellet</p><p>). At 350 °C, the intensity of the Co 3 O 4 Bragg reflections is highly reduced. CoO has now spread through all of the pellet in place of the Co 3 O 4 and Co fcc is starting to appear. At the end of the reduction step (450 °C), the metallic cobalt is now the predominant phase. However, not all of the cobalt oxide is reduced as the Co 3 O 4 phase didn't change and the CoO phase is still present. Finally, during FTS, the cobalt inside the pellet isn't greatly altered, but the outer circumference undergoes a major re-oxidation (CoO and Co 3 O 4 ) which have been reported as a potential effect of the presence of water [2]. This significantly reduces the metallic Co fcc in this area.
