<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diffusion in thin films can significantly differ from the bulk material behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Even though Copper and Tungsten are immiscible, diffusion processes can be observed at temperatures far below their melting point. The poor thermal stability of the layered structure can be referred to the proximity of a volume element to either a free surface or an interphase boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is therefore necessary to observe the material behaviour in situ to obtain a fundamental understanding of the kinetics of inter-and intra-layer diffusion processes as well as the structural evolution of the surface.</p><p>Copper/tungsten (Cu/W) nano-multilayer with the layer thickness of 18/6 nm, respectively, were deposited onto a Silicon substrate (for GISAXS and XRR) and a Kapton susbtrate (for WAXS) by ion beam deposition. The multilayer consists of ten periods of the copper/tungsten bilayer combination, with the total film thickness of 240 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This combination of materials is particularly attractive for microelectronic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, as tungsten provides an efficient diffusion barrier. The high thermal conductivity of Copper combined with the low thermal expansion coefficient of Tungsten allows thermal management on the microscale, for instance in heatsink applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The Cu/W combination is also used for radiation protection. It is therefore crucial to obtain a fundamental understanding of the thermal diffusion processes that occur when heating the multilayer. In order to advance this understanding, we proposed a multi-technique approach for an extensive characterisation of the above-mentioned diffusion processes. These techniques can be grouped in two categories. Firstly, our approach sensitive to the surface and interfaces uses the combination of Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle Scattering (GISAXS) and X-Ray Reflectivity (XRR). In addition, the phase composition and evolution within the material are analysed by Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering (WAXS). For the temperature-dependent analysis of the properties, the sample was attached to the heating cell of a 400K furnace using Cerastil C7 ceramic paste. The furnace chamber was then pumped down to the vacuum of ~210 -2 mbar.</p><p>The beamline setup of BM28 (XMaS) is extremely well suited for using the combination of these techniques. The Pilatus 300K 2D-detector was mounted at th e fixed distance of 1570mm from the sample for the acquisition of GISAXS frames. An APD KF16 point detector was mounted on the arm of the Huber diffractometer for XRR. For each acquisition of the 2D SAXS pattern the diffractometer arm was moved out of the sample-detector line, and GISAXS frames were acquired for different 2-theta angles. Afterwards, the diffractometer arm was moved back, and XRR patterns weer acquired in the scanning mode. This procedure was followed through different heating profiles. One continuous heating ramp was performed from 30˚C to 400˚C with frame acquisition for every 10˚C (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Afterwards, a temperature cycle consisting of three heating and cooling periods 30˚C-250˚C-30˚C was performed with a larger frame step size (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). The GISAXS pattern evolution during the heat ramp is shown on Fig. 3: Fig. 3: GISAXS pattern evolution during constant heating ramp The XRR profile showed the generation of new peaks and oscillations during thermal cycling, as can be seen in Fig. 4. Fig. 4: XRR pattern evolution during thermal cycling: new oscillations appear at higher temperatures For the WAXS setup, the sample was mounted on the heating cell with a thermally conductive copper frame (Fig. 5a) and the Pilatus 300K 2D-detector was mounted on the arm of the Huber diffractometer. The same temperature cycles were performed, while WAXS patterns were acquired for three different -partially overlapping -detector angles. An example of the composite pattern collected is shown in Fig. 5b. Changes in the WAXS pattern are observed during cycling, related to phase transformations within the multilayer. Fig. 5b: Example WAXS pattern obtained during in situ cycling</p><p>The combination of these technques will allow fundamental insights into thin film diffusion, including in immiscible materials, where an arrangement of nanoscale inclusions of distinct phase are formed. The detailed materials science implications of the observations will become clear once the full data sets are evaluated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Sample overview.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,217.81,609.11,174.00,138.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
