<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this proposal was to measure periodic nanorod (NR) arrays grown by seed-free MOVPE growth through a pre-patternd SiN x mask. The samples have been grown by Hendrick Paetzelt for Solid Chemistry department of Leipzig University. In particular we have measured GaAs Nanorods [NR] grown on GaAs[111]B and on Ge [111]. Whereas homoepitaxial seed-free VLS growth is known from literature, expitaxy onto Ge [111]  was new. Patterning of the SiN x mask with lateral spacing of 1 µm &lt; D &lt; 5µm was performed within an area of 600 x 600µm². The NR array was visible by bare eye and could be precharacterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction in home laboratory. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> show a SEM pictures of a GaAs NR sample grown on GaAs[111]B substrate and the respective GaAs(111) reciprocal space map. The hexagonal shape of NR and the hexagonal arrangement of the pattern are clearly visible in the SEM image. The HRXRD map shows periodic side peaks along q x -direction with distance Δq x = 2π/D. Unexpected we found a second row with same period at Δq z /q z = -2,6 10 -3 with respect to GaAs(111) which could not be identified so far. The experiment at ID1 was performed using the nanofocus setup defined by compound refractive lenses focusing the incident beam to a spot size of about 500x1500 nm² which was sufficiently small in order to separate individual NR´s with D&gt;3µm in coplanar symmetric scattering geometry. The use of quasiforbidden 222 reflection revealed most promising because its intensity varies strongly with changing defect density. In order to identify the patterned area we screened the whole sample at fixed angle position of about 1 degree off the exact Bragg peak position. The strength of diffuse scattering varied by more then a factor of 5 inside and outside the patterned area. In addition, we found a change in diffuse scattering by factor 2 at a position exactly on a NR compared to a position in between. This characteristic change of intensity allowed us to scan a limited area of the patterned sample and identify individual nanorods. The mapping for a GaAs NR sample grown on GaAs [111]  is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. One clearly can identify regularly patterned scattering maxima which we have associated with certain NR positions. Next, reciprocal space maps in the vicinity of the (222) reflection have been recorded at selected positions inside and outside the patterned area. Two examples are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, one taken outside the patterned area (left), the other at a certain NR's position (right), showing an additional peak along the vertical crystal truncation rod. This strain feature is visible at the NR position only and is probably related to a strain field imposed by the epitaxy process, The crossed streaks are not related to the sample and are orginating from the experimental setup (Monochromater and PSD, respectively). In order clarify the origin of the strain feature we measure a GaAs NR pattern grown on Ge [111]. Because the Ge(222) reflection is forbidden, substrate intensity is very low. Nevertheless, we found this reflection easily caused by the defects within the substrate material or due to the influence of strain between SiN x mask and the substrate. Therefore, we were able to identify the patterned area by same procedure as described above. Here the gain in diffuse scattering was factor of 10 inside and outside the area. Because of the nonpolar</p></div>
