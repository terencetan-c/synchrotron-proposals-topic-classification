<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Wastes rich in scorodite and arsenopyrite left as a legacy of past mining and smelting operations pose a threat to environmental health. Colloids formed by the weathering of mining and processing wastes may control the release of hazardous elements such as arsenic (As) into surface waters and may contribute to long-distance contaminant transport and dispersion. The nature of colloidal As determines its impact on As mobility and bioavailability and needs to be considered for the mitigation of As release from weathered mine wastes. In this study, we investigated the importance and mode of colloidal As mobilization from weathered processing wastes and from sediments from the draining river bed and a more distant sedimentation pond. Colloids in the surface runoff were collected during simulated rain events and were characterized for their composition, structure and mode of As uptake using a combination of flow field-flow fractionation coupled to plasma mass spectrometry (AF4-ICP-MS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the As and Fe K-edges. Colloidal As mobilized from weathered processing wastes was identified as scorodite, whereas ferrihydrite was the dominant colloidal As carrier in the sedimentation-pond. Considering that surface runoff effectively mobilizes colloidal As from the weathered wastes, measures should be taken to remove the waste material or to cover the material to eliminate further dispersion of colloidal As.</p></div>			</div>
