<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the project was to strain scan bridging and broken fibres in the region around a fatigue matrix crack in a metal matrix composite material in order study stress partitioning between reinforcement and matrix. These data can then be used to calculate the interfacial shear stress, which yields information about interface strength and damage. For this experiment we used two multiply Ti-6Al-4V/SiC-fibre specimens, which had been fatigued in three point bending to different stress levels (1000 and 1400 MPa). This produced one specimen (S1) where all fibres were intact (low stress level) and the other specimen (S2) containing a number of fibre breaks close to the matrix crack. In both cases the matrix contained a large fatigue crack grown perpendicular to the loading axis.</p><p>Before strain scanning, both specimens were examined by X-ray tomography to establish the exact positions of the fibres, the extent of the matrix cracks and the existence of fibre cracks. The tomography studies were carried out on ID19 beam line (ME 112) and at the Manchester Materials Science Centre using a laboratory tomography set-up. S2 showed 3 fibres broken close the matrix fatigue crack in ply 1 (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), whereas no fibre breaks were observed in S1.</p><p>To perform the strain scanning, the specimens were mounted on a tensile rig, which was placed on an x-y-z stage in the second hutch on ID11. The Specimens were compared in the unloaded and different loading conditions corresponding to the stress concentration at the crack tip during fatigue loading.</p><p>The original aim of this experiment was to define a gauge volume small enough to measure one fibre at a time, using a focussed beam and conical slits in conjunction with a Frelon CCD camera. Initial data analysis showed that the (108) SiC diffraction peak did not show any strain variation along the fibres, as we had expected. The reasons for this were not understood, but it was decided with the agreement of the local contact to attempt the experiment without the conical slits, thereby extending the gauge volume to the full specimen thickness whilst retaining the focussed beam. Therefore average strains through the thickness of each ply rather than individual fibre strains were measured. ply 1 ply 6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Direction of crack growth</head><p>The results without the conical slit did show strain variations along the fibres as each ply within the specimens were scanned along the fibre direction. An example of a scan along a row of fibres is shown in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>According to shear lag theory the change in gradient visible in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> at -1mm and 1mm from the crack indicates a transition between bonding and debonding at the interface. Interfacial shear stress (ISS) is at its maximum at these positions in this row.</p><p>The characteristic M-shape in the centre of figure 2 is evidence of reverse sliding taking place at loads below the maximum for the specimen.</p><p>The data are simplest to compare when displayed as contour plots. Examples of strain in the fibres, matrix strain and ISS are shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The triangular damage zone above and below the crack plane can be seen in the fibres and the matrix. The region is bounded by maximum ISS.</p><p>Diffraction peaks for the fibres in the centre of ply 1 of S2 contained a double maximum (see figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), indicating that here the diffraction was the result of averaging fibres in 2 different states of strain. When deconvolved two fibre populations are seen, one lowly stressed (broken) and one highly stressed (intact). The deconvolved data are shown in figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Other plies of fibres did not yield a double diffraction peak.</p><p>We have managed to differentiate between broken and unbroken fibres in ply 1 of S2. What we would like to do in the future is to measure the local environment surrounding broken fibres.
