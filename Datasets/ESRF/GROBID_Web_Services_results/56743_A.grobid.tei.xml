<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The effect of metal modification (1 and 3wt% Fe and Ga) of zeolites by various synthesis methods was studied: (1) incipient wetness impregnation (IMP), (2) ion-exchange (IE), (3) atomic layer deposition (ALD) and (4) isomorphic substitution (ISO). To investigate the structural changes leading to improved activity (from our previous study, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) XAS measurements were performed to study the local environment of Ga and Fe in zeolites during calcination and bioethanol conversion. The structural and electronic changes of the Fe and Ga species were verified in situ in different reactive atmospheres, which mimic the conditions in bioethanol conversion. Analysis of XANES measured during treatment / EXAFS recorded after treatment and subsequent modeling will provide structural details about the arrangement and location of atoms around the absorber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>XAS measurements were performed at the Fe K-edge (7112 eV) and Ga K-edge (10367 eV) in transmission mode. The properties of metal modified ZSM-5 were investigated during reduction (H 2 /He till 650 o C), oxidation (O 2 /He till 550째C) and reactive steps (ethylene reduction and ethanol dehydration up to 450 o C). In situ XANES was performed to follow the oxidation state changes during these treatments. Further, EXAFS scans were recorded before the reaction and at selected stages of catalyst treatments (after reduction, reaction and reoxidation). Hereafter, some examples of experiments and preliminary results are included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed and preliminary results</head><p>In the first stage of experiments, Fe-modified ZSM-5 were tested for changes during reduction and reoxidation. The XAS spectra of all 4 representative samples were obtained and compared with references Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3 for structural and oxidation state changes. In the XANES region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) the pre-edge regions for 3wt%Fe(IMP)-ZSM-5 and 3wt%Fe(IX)-ZSM-5 show similar features to Fe 2 O 3 . Whereas 3-Fe(ISO)-ZSM-5 exhibits pre-edge features, which could be a combination of Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 . For all three samples, these pre-edge features indicate that at least one of the tetrahedral sites is occupied by Fe III . The post-reaction XAS spectra of 3wt%Fe(IX)-ZSM-5 after H 2 -reduction, C 2 H 4 reduction, ethanol dehydration and O 2 -TPO allow to follow the location of Fe at various stages. As a preliminary analysis, the XANES region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) of these XAS spectra were employed to study the final oxidation of this sample. The reduction with H 2 led to the shift in the edge position to a lower energy indicating formation of metallic Fe or FeO. Similarly, the spectrum after C 2 H 4 reduction shows a partial reduction as indicated by the edge position. However, the spectrum after ethanol dehydration indicates incomplete reoxidation. The reoxidation with oxygen also results in partial reoxidation. The k-space spectra (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) of this material reveal that the spectra show features similar to references Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 . A detailed linear combination analysis will yield the exact nature of the sample.   Similarly, changes during treatments of the Ga modified zeolites were identified for Ga(IMP), Ga(IX), Ga(ALD) and Ga(ISO)-ZSM-5. Interesting structural changes were identified especially during the reduction with H 2 and C 2 H 4 . The in situ profiles during H 2 -TPR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) show a decrease in white line intensity and shift in the edge energy indicating the reduction of Ga 2 O 3 . However, during cooling in H 2 the state of the material partially changed back towards Ga 2 O 3 as indicated in the XANES spectrum in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>.  To pursue the changes in structure, full EXAFS measurements were performed at the maximum reduction temperature (650 o C) as well as at room temperature after reduction (25 o C). The R-space spectra reveal a decrease in amplitude of the first shell after reduction as indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. However after cooling the structure remains close to the as prepared Ga 2 O 3 . Similar changes were obtained during the reduction with C 2 H 4 . A detailed EXAFS and in situ XANES analysis of Ga-modified ZSM-5 at various stages of reaction will help to get detailed insight in these structural changes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The effect of metal content (Fe, Ga) on catalyst performance 1 .</figDesc><graphic coords="1,70.80,345.24,159.00,89.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
