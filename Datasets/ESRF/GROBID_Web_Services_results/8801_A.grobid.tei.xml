<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In solid C60 and in most of its compounds, the intermolecular separation is mainly determined by van der Waals interactions and the center to center distance of C60 molecules is typically 1Ok. Recently some exceptions have been found in which C60 molecules are linked by covalent bonds. MIC60 compounds (M=K or Rb) have a polymeric form at room temperature with an orthorombic crystal structure in which C60 ions form chains. There is evidence of covalent bonds between C60 molecules both from powder x-rays diffraction and I3C NMR resonances. The intermolecular separation along the chain is unusually short (an interfullerene C-C distance of about 1.6&amp;6 instead of the usual 3.3&amp; and supports the model of a quasi-one-dimensional electronic conductor. Electron-spin-resonance data support a metal-insulator transition of the polymeric RbIC60 at 50K, in contradiction with the expected metallic character due to the filling of the first empty energy-bands of C60. This phase transition is</p></div>

In contradiction, a recent model developped by S. Erwin to describe the electronic states in the low temperature phase of MIC60 shows that the electronic properties of even this polymerized phase remain strongly 3-D, without a zero density of states at Fermi level. Our first aim is to test the waves functions of S. Erwin comparing the experimental compton profiles with the theoretical profiles. Theoretical profiles are obtained using the plane wave expansion of wave functions from an ab-initio self-consistent field calculation (SCF) of the energy band-structure. The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method within the local-density-approximation has been employed for this calculation.</p><p>Recently, a not polymeric (fee) MlC60 compounds (M=K or Rb) has been also synthesized. Our second aim is to compare the electron momentum distribution of the polymeric phase with its covalent inter balls bonds with the fee not polymeric phase. Experiments on polymeric and not polymeric M lC60 have been performed at ESRF, using the scanning mode spectrometer of beam line ID15B. Synchrotron radiation have been monochromatized at 55.8 keV. The photons are back-scattered by a sample of MlC60 powder under argon atmosphere and analysed by a Ge(440) curved analysing crystal. The scattered photons spectrum is measured at the scattering angle of 160". The resolution is determined from the full width at half maximum of the thermal diffuse scattering peak, which is 0.3 a.u., when expressed in terms of the electron momentum scale. For comparison, the Compton profile of a powder of C60 has been measured, using exactly the same experimental conditions as for MlC60.</p><p>Difference of profiles obtained on the two solids is used in order to eliminate effects of systematic experimental errors.</p></div>		</body>
