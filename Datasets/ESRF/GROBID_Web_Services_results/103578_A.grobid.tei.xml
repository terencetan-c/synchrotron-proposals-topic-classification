<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Investigating Octopus arm sensory receptors In the present experiment, we exploited X-ray phase contrast tomography to investigate the presence, structure and innervation pathway of the muscle proprioception in the octopus arm and the structure and organization of mechano and chemical receptors of the octopus arm sucker. The samples consisted in small slabs of tissues (about 2mm x 1mm) coming from the octopus arm suckers. We distinguished the regions: normal sucker acetabulum, extra sucker acetabulum, normal sucker infundibulum, normal sucker infundibulum. The samples were included in paraffin and for the imaging were cut with a 1mmbiopuncher.</p><p>The tomography was produced by means of 2000 projections for 4 distances, with an effective pixel size of 100nm or 80 nm, depending on the samples. The acquisition time for each angular position was 200 ms.</p><p>We also carried out 1-distance acquisitions with 4000 projections to test the resulting image quality with a faster scanning procedure.</p><p>Data preprocessing, phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction were performed in situ by using ID16a softwares. By comparing the sucker receptors at infundibulum and acetabulum level we have been able to identify the morphological features tyical of these structures. We are still working on the interpretation of the data with our collaborators of University of Genoa that are correlating our findings with their SEM and TEM investigations. However, the results of the experiment appear very good and promising.</p><p>There was a beamdump during the first day of the beamtime. Between day 2 and day 3 of the beamtime we had one day of Machine Dedicated Time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): CEDOLA Alessia, CNR Nanotec -Piazzale Aldo Moro 7 IT -00185 ROMA PALERMO Francesca, CNR Nanotec -Piazzale Aldo Moro 7 IT -00185 ROMA MARROCCO Nicole, CNR Nanotec -Piazzale Aldo Moro 7 IT -00185 ROMA Report:</figDesc></figure>
