<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of our principal areas of research focuses on the capture and removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) by recently developed porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). 1 MOF materials are porous frameworks constructed from metal ions or clusters bridged by functional organic ligands. Capture and storage of CO 2 in MOFs is potentially of great significance in the development of the "Low-Carbon Economy" and thereby in the mitigation of global warming. However, the CO 2 adsorption capacities in MOFs under dynamic conditions have remained insufficient for practical applications, and strategies to enhance CO 2 /host interaction and hence adsorption capacity are required.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated factors which control the capture capacity of CO 2 and SO 2 from gas mixtures under dynamic conditions and studied framework phase changes under different sample environments. We had previously established the crystal structures of two solvated framework materials (SOF-2 and NOTT-203) from single-crystal diffraction methods, and these materials show highly unusual gas uptakes with stepwise adsorption and hysteretic desorption isotherms. However, it is only by carrying out in situ powder X-ray diffraction measurements at ESRF Beamline ID31 that we have been able to probe the interaction between adsorbed gas molecules and framework material and to study changes in the local framework structure upon guest inclusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part I. In-situ PXRD study of the microporous supramolecular framework SOF-2</head><p>We recently synthesised a new hydrogen-bonded organic framework material (denoted as SOF-2) from a polyamine-functionalised ligand. The solvated crystal structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) has been determined by single crystal methods. The ligand co-crystallises with the solvent molecules via hydrogen bonding, forming a threedimensional extended framework structure which incorporates large structural voids. Significantly, the desolvated material is stable upon removal of guest solvent molecules as suggested by the TGA and PXRD, and therefore generates permanent micropores which have the potential to capture gas molecules.</p><p>The CO 2 adsorption isotherm at 196 K exhibits two steps coupled with a small degree of hysteresis upon desorption. At high temperatures (273 K and 283 K), the adsorption/desorption hysteresis loop shifts to a high pressure region (10-16 bar), but with similar uptake capacity. The CO 2 gas-specific isothermal sorption profiles observed at 196 K suggest the presence of a breathing process featuring a structural phase transition between two forms of this material, namely a narrow pore (np) form and a large pore (lp) form. The additional uptake of CO 2 is, therefore, due to the gas-specific framework breathing from np to lp to provide additional accessible pore volume. This phase change is triggered by a specific CO 2 gas uptake of ~1.5 mmol/g. a b Figure. 2 CO 2 isotherms at 196 K (a) 273 and 283 K (b) for desolvated SOF-2.</p><p>To further understand the mechanism of the phase transition, we carried out an in-situ PXRD study of this material on Beamline ID31 at ESRF. In-situ powder diffraction studies at various CO 2 pressures (0-20 bar) were carried out at 195 K to track the framework breathing behaviour during the adsorption/desorption process. The powder patterns of solvated SOF-2 and in-situ-desolvated SOF-2 were recorded at 273 K at 0, 4, 10, 14, 20, and 25 bar of CO 2 adsorption loadings and at 9 and 4 bar of CO 2 desorption loadings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>Powder diffraction patterns from the bare material (0 bar) confirms that the framework remains intact after degassing, and no apparent peak change was observed at 10 bar CO 2 loadings, confirming retention of the original np phase at low pressure. At CO 2 pressure of 14 bar and above, shifting and splitting of peaks were observed in the diffractograms, confirming a structural change and the presence of the lp phase at high pressures. The powder pattern for the final degassed material confirms the disappearance of these new peaks and shows the presence of the original np phase, confirming the reversibility of this breathing process. These results are entirely consistent with the CO 2 isotherms at 273 K and thermodynamic analysis, strongly supporting the proposed gas-specific change on pore structure. Part II. SO 2 -induced framework breathing behaviour in the flexible MOF NOTT-203 We have synthesised an indium-carboxylate MOF material (denoted as NOTT-203). The crystal structure for the as-synthesised material has been determined by single crystal diffraction methods. It shows a (4,4)connected 3D framework structure with pore diameter of 1.5 nm (Fig. 4). The as-synthesised material undergoes a framework phase transition upon desolvation, and the crystal structure of the desolvated material has also been obtained by single crystal diffraction methods, confirming the flexibility of this MOF material. a b Figure 4. Views of (a) the coordination environment of the [In(O 2 CR) 4 ] node; (b) the (4,4)-connected diamondoid network for NOTT-203.</p><p>The desolvated material shows interesting SO 2 sorption isotherms with two-adsorption steps and a broad hysteretic desorption loop (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>). Between 268 and 283 K, NOTT-203 gives type-IV isotherms with apparent adsorption/desorption hysteresis loops. A maximum uptake of 13.6 mmol g -1 (86.9 wt%) was recorded at 268 K and 1.0 bar. At low SO 2 pressure (below 0.1 bar), narrow hysteresis loops between SO 2 uptake of 0 and ~7 mmol g -1 were observed at all three temperatures. At higher temperatures of 293-303 K, the hysteresis loops at high SO 2 pressure disappear and corresponding desorption isotherms give good reversibility. However, the hysteresis loops at low SO 2 pressure (below 0.15 bar) are still present but much narrower than those at low temperatures. Interestingly, NOTT-203 show similar uptake capacities of SO 2 at 1.0 bar for all three temperatures (293, 298 and 303 K), suggesting that similar SO 2 -host systems are achieved at 1.0 bar for all three temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>). This observation is unusual for physisorption in which the uptake capacity is driven by the temperature of the system. Comparison of the SO 2 adsorption isotherms at all six temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>) indicates that at low pressures the uptake capacities decrease gradually with increasing temperature. At increased pressure, adsorption of SO 2 at 293, 298 and 303 K reaches saturation at similar uptake capacities of ~8 mmol g -1 at 1.0 bar. In contrast, adsorption isotherm of SO 2 at 293 K, 298 K and 303 K show inflection points above the saturated uptake of ~8 mmol g -1 at 0.35 bar, 0.45 bar and 0.75 bar, respectively, and a further 2-6 mmol g -1 of SO 2 are adsorbed at 1.0 bar, indicating the pore structure expands to allow additional SO 2 uptakes under these conditions. These results suggest that NOTT-203 has excellent capacity and ability for SO 2 capture. We then measured the in-situ PXRD for the desolvated material at different SO 2 loadings at 273 K to track the framework phase change during the sorption process (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>). A dramatic change on the powder diffraction patterns was observed upon SO 2 inclusion at a particular pressure (540 mbar), and the framework phase change is irreversible upon removal of SO 2 molecules (see 0 mbar des). The shift of the diffraction peaks to lower 2θ angle indicates an expansion of the unit cell, consistent with the larger pore phase suggested from the sorption isotherm results. The powder pattern at the final stage (after adsorption and desorption of SO 2 ) can be indexed to a trigonal cell: the two possible unit cells found are summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Structure determinations using both these unit cell assignments for this phase are currently under investigation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure. 1 Views of the X-ray crystal structure of SOF-2.
