<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Oxidation-state and/or structural changes at the metal center are the basis for the catalytic reactions of most metalloenzymes. Knowing the oxidation states and structures of reaction intermediates is a prerequisite to understand the catalytic function. To follow these changes in real time is a major challenge in structural biophysics. Time-resolved BioXAS represents a particularly promising tool to resolve such intermediates. The development of such techniques is one of the primary goals of our research; important progress has been obtained in May 2003.</p><p>The reaction cycle of oxygen production at the tetra-manganese complex of photosystem II (PSII) of photosynthesis involves 4 semistable intermediates (S 0 , S 1 , S 2 , S 3 ) of the Mn complex which can be prepared by nanosecond Laser-flashes. Investigations on structural intermediates during the particularly interesting oxygen-producing step (occuring on the S 3 -S 0 transition inducible by the 3 rd Laser flash) are expected to elucidate details of the still unknown reaction mechanism of oxygen production. PSII multilayer samples were prepared at the beamline by a novel drop-and-dry technique and positioned in the X-ray beam by a new computer-controlled sample-changer (20 samples per charge, µm accuracy). Illumination by trains of Laser flashes (5 ns, 532 nm, ~150 mJ) was carried out at room temperature. About 400 rapid-scan XAS measurements (synchronuous scan of monochromator and undulator gap) and ~700 timescans of X-ray fluorescence at fixed excitation energies for sampling-XAS measurements (see report SC-1013) were collected at the Mn K-edge. About 300 timescans with µs time-resolution were recorded by a personal computer equipped with an A/D card. Each scan was performed on a fresh sample. Specialized electronics provided synchronization of Laser, sample exchange, and data acquisition.</p><p>The following results were obtained:</p><p>(1) Rapid-scan XAS measurements (12 s per scan) on samples Laser-flash illuminated in the X-ray beam yielded EXAFS spectra of the Mn complex predominantly in states S 1 (0F, zero flash sample), S 2 (1F), S 3 (2F) and S 0 (3F) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). 2F 0F 1F 2F 3F</p><p>(2) The new technique of sampling-XAS in principle allows for the construction of complete XAS spectra spaced by only microseconds in time (see report SC1013). From timescans of X-ray fluorescence as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> recorded at 28 excitation energies, good-quality room temperature XANES spectra of the Mn complex were obtained (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The shown spectra have been measured within only 400 ms after the respective Laser flash. The upshifts of the K-edge energy in the 1F and 2F spectra indicate Mn oxidations whereas the downshift on the 3F spectrum is due to Mn reduction on the oxygen-producing step S 3 -S 0 (arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> denote remarkable edge features).</p><p>Sampling-XAS experiments have also been performed at ~60 energies in the EXAFS region. The analysis of data is expected to provide room temperature EXAFS spectra of the Mn complex obtained within only 400 ms in the S 1 state and after predominant population of the S 2 , S 3 , and S 0 -states by Laser flash illumination.</p><p>(3) To follow the reduction of Mn on the oxygen-producing transition S 3 -S 0 (on the 3 rd Laser flash) in real time, timescans of fluorescence were recorded, for the first time, at 200 µs per point. At 6552.8 eV a rise-time of 1.2 ms is well resolved (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, left). This rise-time is typical for most intact and active PSII preparations. Time-resolved measurements were performed at 5 excitation energies and sampling-XANES spectra were constructed before and after the flash 3 which induces the oxygen-producing transition S 3 -S 0 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, right). Spectra are spaced by only 500 µs in time. To our knowledge, the data in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> (right) represent the first example of XANES spectra that have been obtained at sub-ms time resolution and at room temperature during an oxidation state change at the metal center of a metalloenzyme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>We consider the run SC1229 as particularly successful because important progress was made with respect to the development of time-resolved BioXAS techniques which allow for sub-ms resolution of structural and oxidation state changes at biological metal centers. For the first time, by using new methods for sample preparation and positioning and for data acquisition, we succeded in following the reduction of the Mn complex on the most important oxygen-producing transition with microsecond time resolution under physiological conditions (room temperature). First transient XANES spectra during this step were obtained. The quantitative evaluation of data is in progress. We intend to submit a paper on (some of) the obtained results already in October/November 2003.  0F 1F 2F 3F Fig. 4: Left: Fluorescence transient (dots) at 6552.8 eV induced by Laser flash no. 3 (36 scans averaged, 200 µs per point, line = simulation).
