Attfield, CSEC, University of Edinburgh Mr. R.J. Goff*, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge Prof. P.G. Radaelli, ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Dr. J.P. Wright*, ESRF Report: Charge ordering (CO) transitions, at which a long range order of two different metal valence states occurs, is of much current interest in solid state physics and chemistry. Much of this interest has been stimulated by work on doped manganite perovskites such as the Pr 1-</p><p>x Ca x MnO 3 system, but there are also many other charge ordered oxides such as the YBaM 2 O 5 (M= Mn,Co, Fe) materials, in which CO is observed for all three metals. Proof of long range CO comes from a reliable structure determination, but this is often made difficult by the subtle symmetry-lowering distortions that usually accompany the CO transition. This can lead to microtwinning which makes single crystal studies difficult, so high resolution powder diffraction offers some advantages. A joint refinement with X-ray and neutron powder diffraction combines the advantantages of the two techniques, as we have shown in our recent determination of CO in Fe 3 O 4 below the Verwey transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, which has been an outstanding problem for more than 60 years.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Pr 1-x Ca x MnO 3</head><p>Powder diffraction patterns were measured at 180 K and 10 K on both Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 MnO 3 and Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 MnO 3 using a wavelength of 0.5889 Å with a maximum 2θ of 70°. The four diffraction patterns were collected for about six hours each with longer counting times at higher angles. The samples were held in a 0.4 mm capillary while the measurements were taken.</p><p>The low temperature charge ordered structure was determined in Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 MnO 3 at 10 K using combined refinements of X-ray and powder neutron diffraction data. The neutron diffraction data was obtained using HRPD, ISIS Facility. We are currently testing the two proposed crystallographic models, P2 1 /m and Pm with Pnm2 1 pseudosymmetry. These models are shown in the figure, the Mn-O bonds along the elongated dz 2 orbital are dotted and arrows show the direction of the magnetic moments.</p><p>Preliminary refinements indicate that the P2 1 /m Goodenough model of charge and orbital gives the best fit to the powder diffraction patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Fe 3 O 4</head><p>The powder diffraction pattern was measured using a wavelength of 1.8049 Å with a maximum 2θ of 130° at 90 K. The sample geometry used was half-annular and the diffraction pattern was measured for eight hours with longer counting times at higher angles.</p><p>The diffraction pattern measured at a wavelength of 1.8 Å is being used in a combined refinement with the previously measured pattern at 0.5 Å and the neutron diffraction pattern measured on HRPD, ISIS Facility. This data gives a better resolution of the monoclinic splitting of the lattice enabling the orthorhombic Pmca symmetry constraints that were used in previous refinements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> to be released and the structure refined in P2/c.</p></div>		</body>
