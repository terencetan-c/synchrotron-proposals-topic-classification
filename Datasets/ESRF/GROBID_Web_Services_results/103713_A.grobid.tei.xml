<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Rebecca E. Ginesi (UofG)* Dave J. Adams (UofG, PI) Report:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Transient supramolecular gel systems can be designed such that pre-determined changes in state occur. Due to their dynamic nature and high degree of tunability, such systems are of great interest both for the potential analogy to out-of-equilibrium biological systems and the formation of novel stimuli-responsive materials. 1 For instance, regenerating materials for drug release or self-healing materials can be envisioned. 2 Two low molecular weight gelators were used prepare systems undergoing gel-to-sol-to-gel transitions by using a previously reported pH-cycle. 3 In such systems, the final properties and morphologies of the material depend on both molecular structure and rate of pH change, allowing us to design a variety of materials starting from a single starting gel. A key question is to understand how the morphology of the self-assembled structures changes throughout the different phases and during re-assembly. Here, we have used in-situ SAXS to probe the systems as they evolve. This allowed us to observe how different gelators possessing different initial morphologies respond to the phase changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment details</head><p>In the original beamtime proposal, a Rheo-SAXS set-up was proposed. However, due to unavailability of the rheometer, only SAXS data was collected. Small-angle data was collected of the samples prepared in borosilicate glass capillaries over a period of 16 hours with 10-seconds exposures every 5 minutes. The gels were prepared directly in the capillary right before starting the measurement. A script was provided by the local contact to measure SAXS data at different time intervals during the collection period.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To enable us to study the changes in assembly during gel-to-sol-to-gel transitions, two different gelators with different initial morphologies were used, CarbFV and FmocFA. These materials form gels at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in DMSO/H2O (20/8, v/v). To induce the pH cycle, two competing pH triggers were used by adding urea (4M), urease (0.4 mg/mL) and methyl formate (100 uL) as previously reported. 3 At the start, a gel is formed</p></div>

Re-gelation is then triggered once the hydrolysis reaction of methyl formate becomes dominant, leading to a reduction in pH below the apparent pKa. In both systems, a significant change in structure can be observed as the gel-to-sol transition takes place within the first 20 minutes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). For the CarbFV system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), the SAXS patterns appear to shift from less persistent strucutres in the gel phase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, blue) to more cylinder-like structures in the solution phase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, orange and green), potentially related to the presence of worm-like micelles in solution. In the case of the FmocFA system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), the opposite behaviour can be observed. At the start, significant scattering can be observed due to the presence of persistent structures making up the gel network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, blue). As the sample transits to solution, the scattering pattern appears to change (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, orange). This can be related to the presence of less self-assembled structures in solution or spherical micelles. In both cases, the new structure formed in solution appears to lock in during re-gelation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, red data), suggesting that the gel-to-sol-togel process allows to form novel materials with different underlying structures by means of a pH change. The results from this beamtime allowed us to gain insights into how the molecular structure of the gelator affects initial gel properties and how it can be tuned to design novel materials using a pH cycle. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future work</head><p>The results from this beamtime gave us an insightful understanding in the way self-assembled structures can respond to pH-triggers and how this can be used to form novel materials with different morphologies. We are currently in the process of fitting the SAXS data to gain further information on how the different structures change over time (radius, length, etc.) at key points during the pH cycle. We plan to apply for further beamtime to carry out Rheo-SAXS to gather how these morphological changes affect the bulk properties of the final gel material.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
