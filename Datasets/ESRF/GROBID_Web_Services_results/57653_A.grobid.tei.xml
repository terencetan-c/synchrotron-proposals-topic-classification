<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experiment ES 348 allowed us to successfully analyse five samples of secondary carbonate (calcrete) from Montenegro. Such material is typically used to date geological sequences through uranium series (U-series) analysis. The samples had previously been bulk U-series dated and span an age range of 350,000 years to 65,000 years BP. The beamline data effectively identified different phases of formation within the calcretes, and allowed us to explore their elemental composition. In particular, we established the dominant detrital components of the different formation phases, and were able to explore the distribution of uranium across the samples. Understanding the way that uranium is stored within the calcrete crystal matrix is important for our ability to effectively target individual crystal phases for accurate uranium-series dating. This is especially significant because bulk U-series dating is standard procedure, but it may be obscuring considerable variation in the timing of calcrete formation phases, and/or incorporating detritally contaminated crystals.</p><p>Having established the elemental content and distribution of the sample, we have recently applied for, and been successfully granted, a bid to the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) isotope laboratory (NIGL)for high-resolution, in-situ U-series analysis of the calcrete samples, so that the ages of the individual formation phases can be compared with their elemental composition. The ESRF data was a key factor in the success of the proposal, and will allow us to progress with the research with a view to analyse a larger dataset at the ESRF, and at the NIGL, in future. The applicants will arrange laboratory analysis at NIGL for 2017. The additional U-series data will allow us to target a higher profile journal for the publication of the XRF results from the ESRF. It is therefore anticipated that the data from the ESRF will be published or, at least in review, by the end of 2017.</p><p>The applicants have also applied to the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) ion microprobe facility, for in-situ analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of the samples. This will allow us to examine the atmospheric conditions at the time of calcrete formation, and tie this with the U-series ages and XRF data. It has been requested that the applicants resubmit their proposal once the U-series analysis has been completed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Experiment title :</head><label>title</label><figDesc>High spatial resolution mapping of elemental distributions within calcrete secondary carbonate archives to improve dating and palaeoclimate reconstruction</figDesc></figure>
