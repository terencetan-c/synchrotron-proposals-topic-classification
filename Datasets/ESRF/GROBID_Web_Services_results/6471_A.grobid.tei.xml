<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The velocity c and linewidth r of acoustic phonons of fused silica (v-SiO~) are known up to w 400 GHz. One has c 3 constant and I-ccw' (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). On the basis of thermal conductivity one expects a crossover jnto a phonon-Rayleigh-scattering regime, r cco4 that terminates into r z o at the Ioffe-Regel crossover, @tR P 1 THz. Above @tR the excitations are believed to be non-propagative. The purpose of our investigation has been to study acoustic excitations in the Ioffe-Regel crossover region. The main outcome of our analysis is the position of @tR shown by the star in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows Brillouin neutron scattering and X-ray results. The neutron results were obtained on IN5 at the ILL (see ILL experimental report). What one sees in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> is a scatteringvector-dependent boson peak. It has been fitted with a spectral function which is suited to represent the phonon to lore-Regel crossover and which was tested in details in Brillouin scattering from aerogels.[l] Fits depend only on OtR, on the intensities, and on a parameter describing the sharpness of the crossover for which a good value is m = 2. The spectral intensity is found to be approximately constant, which supports this approach. The qR-value is that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, with a corresponding wave vector qIR H 1 run-1 .</p><p>The X-ray results were obtained in 11 shifts on BL21-ID16, in the unfocused configuration, at 17.8 KeV, with a resolution of 3.2 meV. What is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> is the difference between the signal at 300 K, and the properly scaled elastic signal measured at 20 K on the same sample. The background is also subtracted. One recognizes a weak but definite inelastic contribution. The solid lines represent the theoretical spectral function convoluted with the instrument response. It is calculated with the parameters found in the neutron experiment, and only the intensities have been adjusted. The overall x2 is w 0.5. The spectral intensities are approximately constant within the accuracy. There is only one fairly broad peak, that broadens with increasing q, and there are no propagating phonons following a linear dispersion which at q = 4 nm-t would correspond to tro = 15 meV. We conclude that halRs4 meV and qraz 1 nm-. * For q above qtn, we expect that the excitations are nonpropagative. More details are found in [2]. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure I .</head><label>I</label><figDesc>Figure I. Linewidths vs. frequencies in v-Si02.
