<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Combining the polar displacements and octahedra tilting of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 and magnetoelectric EuTiO3, the Ba1-xEuTiO3 (BETO) solid solution displays very interesting physical properties, as recently shown in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In experiment CH4799, we measured accurately the structure of BETO at long, medium, and short length scales, as a function of both temperature and composition, by means of high resolution powder diffraction measurements coupled with the real-space Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>Samples of Ba1-xEuxTiO3 (x = 0.05, 0.15, 0.20, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0) were prepared using a Pechini method followed by annealing and sintering under reducing conditions at 1273 K, as described in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Two compositions (x = 0.05 and 0.15) were additionally annealed at 1473 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection strategy</head><p>XRPD data were collected at the ID22 beamline selecting an X-ray wavelength of λ = 0.335014(5) Å and using a 9-elements detector array (high resolution setup). Powdered samples of BETO were cooled down to 10 K in a He-cryostat and PDF-quality patterns were collected up to Qmax ≈ 26 Å -1 . Next, samples were heated to 150 K with an heating rate of 1 K/min while Rietveld quality patterns were collected up to Qmax= 14 Å -1 at fixed temperature values (T = 30, 50, 70, 90, 120, 150 K). In addition, samples with x = 0.05 and 0.15 fired at 1473 K, were measured at 120, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 K using the cryostream for heating. Fast patterns (60 seconds) were also collected continually during all temperature ramps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>All solid solution prepared at 1273 K are cubic down to 10 K. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the Rietveld refinements of the samples x = 0.05 and x = 0.80 using the cubic perovskite structural model (space group Pm-3m) are shown as examples. Preliminary Rietveld analysis revealed a complex behaviour of the atomic mean square parameters U (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The bell shaped dependence of U(O) on composition matches the positional disorder induced by the Eu/Ba mixing at the A-site with fluctuations expected in Eu/Ba-O interatomic distances. Differently, U(Ti) decreases monotonically by increasing Eu 2+ concentration and for Ba-rich samples, particularly for x = 0.05, U(Ti) is three times larger as U(Ba/Eu), suggesting a local polar distortion of Ti atoms within the overall cubic structure. The Williamson-Hall size/strain analysis revealed the presence of a very huge strain (quantified by the strain parameter ε = Δa/a) for intermediate compositions. Williamson-Hall analysis. The inset reports selected WH fits pertinent to EuTiO3 (black circles) and to x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 solid solutions (red, green and blue circles). In all the figures, dashed lines are guides for the eyes.</p><p>Unlike any of the samples prepared at 1273 K, solid solutions with x = 0.05 and 0.15 sintered at 1473 K were rhombohedral (space group R3m) at 10 K. On heating up to 400 K, these two samples underwent all the phase transitions typical for BaTiO3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: i) to orthorhombic Amm2; ii) to tetragonal P4mm space group and, finally, iii) to cubic Pm-3m space group. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows as examples the patterns at 10 K (space group R3m) and 400 K (space group Pm-3m) of Ba0.85Eu0.15TiO3-δ prepared at 1473 K. The short-and medium-range structures are being studied by means of PDF analysis through the G(r) function. Analysing G(r) curves for different compositions in a wide range of interatomic distances allows understanding both nature and coherence length of distortions induced by the different chemical environments of Ba and Eu. To aid in this understanding, EXAFS measurements on the same samples (taking place at BM23 in early April [3]) will discriminate the specific contributions of Ba and Eu to the short-range structure. Comparing the G(r) of pairs of samples with the same composition, but annealed at different temperatures highlights their structural contrasting behaviour at low T values, as noted above when discussing phase transitions. Figure 4 shows selected ranges of the experimental G(r) of samples x = 0.05 (top panel) and x = 0.15 (bottom panel) annealed at 1273 (black curves) and 1473 K (red curves). At low r, differences between samples annealed at different temperatures are negligible and all curves can be fitted using the same rhombohedral structural model describing the average structure of the 1473 K annelaed sample at the same temperature (10 K). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the fits of G(r) curves at low r values related to x = 0.05 and 0.15 samples annealed at 1273 K. The low fit residuals (RW) signal a good agreement with the local R3m space group despite their average cubic structure. The G(r) curves of samples with the same composition and different annealing temperatures only become different in a further r range (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). In particular, the G(r) peaks of the samples annealed at 1273 K are visibly smeared compared with those of the samples annealed at 1473 K, suggesting smaller crystallite coherence length and/or increased disorder. Also, while for samples annealed at 1473 K the coherence length of rhombohedral domains seems to be hardly affected by sample composition, the G(r) peaks of the samples annealed at 1273 K clearly broaden with increasing Eu concentration, suggesting that the structural order is a complex function of the annealing temperature and composition. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlooks and future developments</head><p>The formidable Q-resolution of the ID22 beamline makes it possible to study the structure of BETO solid solutions at different length scales, which is of extreme importance to fully understand the (thermal) transport properties of these thermoelectric materials. On one hand, the electronic structure should be strictly related to the crystallographic short range structure and band calculations based only on the average cubic structure should be inaccurate. On the other hand, charge and heat transport should be affected by the local structure, the degree of disorder, and the way the local rhombohedral domains merge into the average structure, e.g. by the coherence length of R3m domains which, as shown above, depends on both composition and sintering temperature. In a recently submitted beamtime proposal we plan to measure more accurately samples in the Ba-rich part of the phase diagram (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30), where local rhombohedral domains dominate the short-range BETO structure. High resolution experiments will be performed on samples annealed at different temperatures. In fact, laboratory XRPD measurements at room temperature showed that samples with x &gt; 0.15 annealed at 1473 K are cubic, while annealing at 1673 K results in a tetragonal structure. High resolution XRPD data will be taken from 10 K to above the tetragonal-cubic phase transition (300-400 K, depending on the sample).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
