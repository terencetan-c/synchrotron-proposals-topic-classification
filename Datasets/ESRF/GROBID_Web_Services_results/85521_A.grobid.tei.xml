<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The plan of this experiment was to investigate the low temperature lattice dynamics of the system BaVS3, which crystalizes at room temperature in the hexagonal structure with space group P63/mmc and lattice parameters a=6.719 Å, and c=5.619 Å. Its structure consists of chains of V-S face sharing octahedra running in c-direction and separated by Ba. At TS=240 K, BaVS3 undergoes a first symmetry lowering from hexagonal to orthorhombic symmetry through a displacive second order phase transition associated with a zigzag deformation of the V-S chains.</p><p>We started our investigations by conducting a Thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) survey in temperature on ID28 side station. 3D reconstruction of the diffuse signal around 301 reflection far above (T=330 K), just above (T=260 K) and below TS (T=200 K) are gathered in Fig 1 . A, B and C respectively. Upon approaching the transition, a strong diffuse signal was detected centered at the Γ point and disappears below the transition, indicating the softening of a zone-center phonon. This remarkable change in the TDS is a clear indication that the transition at TS is driven by the softening of a phonon. However the soft mode could never be observed experimentally in Raman experiments. In view of these striking preliminary results, we decided to focus the IXS measurements on the transition at TS, as it the meV resolution achieved at ID28 could allow to resolve the longstanding discussion about the soft mode character of the hexagonal-orthorhombic phase tranisition in BaVS3.</p><p>The lattice dynanics in temperature was further investigated by IXS around q=(3.1,0,1). The dispersion of the soft mode was measured above TS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>), and its softening is evidenced by the large variation of the central peak upon approaching the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). Combined TDS and IXS experiments allowed to measure the soft mode and to identify it with a low energy optical mode, where the Raman experiments could clearly not allow its observation. Analysis of the DFT calculations are ongoing to identify the soft mode, the results will be summarized in a publication soon.</p><p>The combined use of the side station of ID28 with the IXS sepctrometer was decisive in the success of this experiment. We thank the ESRF and the referees for the acceptance of this proposal, and will communicate the publication to the ESRF database as soon as it is processed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
