<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Multiplet {112} which contains 4 components in triclinic, 2 -in monoclinic, and is not split in the orthorhombic system. (a) -comparison of the stoichiometric LiMn 2 TeO 6 composition (blue) and its oxidation (green), and reduction products (red); (b) -comparison of LiMn 2 TeO 6 (blue), and substitution products: Li 1.1 Mn 1.9 TeO 6 (green), and Li 0.9 Mn 2.1 TeO 6 (red ); (c) -comparison of LiMn 2 TeO 6 (blue) and magnesium substitution products with lithium or manganese: Li 0.9 Mg 0.1 Mn 2 TeO 6 (red) -orthorhombic, LiMg 0.06 Mn 1.94 TeO 6 (cyan) -triclinic with a monoclinic impurity, LiMg 0.1 Mn 1.9 TeO 6 (green) -monoclinic .</p><p>Other first interesting physical results of mathematical processing of the obtained experimental data are the following.</p><p>Room-temperature investigation of Na 2 Ni 2 TeO 6 This compound is interested for its very high solid-state sodium ion conductivity and unusual magnetic properties. From the laboratory powder XRD data, its crystal structure was shown to be a superstructure of the well known hexagonal layered P2 type with P6 3 /mcm symmetry. Other Na 2 M 2 TeO 6 (M = Co, Zn, Mg) have very similar lattice parameters but another space group, P6 3 22, due to a different stacking mode of the same layers. However, careful inspection of the XRD pattern of Na 2 Ni 2 TeO 6 revealed a weak reflection (101) forbidden in P6 3 /mcm and anomalous broadening of the (00l) reflections. This might indicate presence of stacking faults or admixture of the P6 3 22 polytype as a separate phase. It was expected that the problem might be solved by the synchrotron XRD study due to its much higher resolution and sensitivity. Indeed, the synchrotron XRD study unambiguously showed that "broadened (00l) reflections" are actually split into two distinct reflections from different layered phases (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In addition, several weak reflections specific for the P6 3 22 polytype (and also to the Ni 3 TeO 6 impurity) were detected. This permitted separate refinement of lattice constants of the two polytypes within one sample (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).  Room-temperature investigation of Li 3 Ni 2 SbO 6 and Na 3 Co 2 SbO 6 These two compounds are interested for their possible use as electrode materials for lithium-ion or sodium-ion batteries and for their unusual magnetic properties. Both are superlattices of the well-known rhombohedral layered α-NaFeO 2 type (O3 type) with honeycomb arrangement of magnetic cations. Their laboratory XRD patterns were indexed with high figures of merit in the trigonal space group P3 1 12. However, by analogy with some similar phases, monoclinic symmetry might be suggested.</p><p>Indeed, XRD profile refinements of Li 3 Ni 2 SbO 6 within two models, P3 1 12 and C2/m, showed some preference to the latter. However, the monoclinic symmetry could not be proved unambiguously because no splitting of the trigonal reflections could be observed with a laboratory XRD instrument. For Na 3 Co 2 SbO 6 , the powder neutron diffraction refinement was only performed within the C2/m model, and possibility of trigonal symmetry was not tested at all.</p><p>Owing to much better resolution of the synchrotron instrument, this splitting of several reflections was actually observed in the present work and, thus, the monoclinic model was proved unambiguously for both compounds. Lattice parameters from the different experiments are in reasonable agreement (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). temperature investigation of Na 3.9 Co 1.05 TeO 6</p><p>The room-temperature structure of this phase was solved from the laboratory powder XRD data and showed to be a novel monoclinic structure type. Subsequent investigation of its static and dynamic magnetic properties revealed two anomalies at about 220 K and 110 K that might be associated with structural transitions. To elucidate this point, the low-temperature synchrotron XRD study was performed. However, temperature dependence of the lattice parameters did not show any structural anomaly.</p><p>Thus, the experiment No. HC-928 was carried out in full. The numerous experimental data are received. The first mathematical processing of experimental data yielded new physical results. Due to the features of the objects of research in this case the joint SR-neutron analysis appeared the most effective. At present the main part of experimental results is in a data processing and preparation the publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 2.
