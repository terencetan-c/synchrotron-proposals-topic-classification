<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>IXS experiment on NaMn 7 O 12 was performed at ID28 with the spectrometer setting with Si(9,9,9) reflection of the backscattering monochromator, leading to photon energy E = 17.794 keV and energy resolution of δE=3.2 meV. Machine mode was 16 bunches. Sample was etched to a needle shape like crystal that was reglued on a capillary to have the (HK0) with respect to the cubic HT phase on the scattering plane. The sample temperature was changed with a LN cryostream. The measured Q points at various temperature T&gt;150K were measured around τ=(400), τ=(440) and τ=(600).</p><p>First, a survey of the reciprocal scattering at 295K was performed to explore the features of the major phonon branches, since the present was the first phonon spectroscopy experiment on NaMn 7 O 12 . In transverse scans, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the dispersion of strongest acoustic mode clearly deviates from sinusoidal behavior for ξ&gt;0.4 . Physical explanation may include a flattening of transverse Δ 3 acoustic mode at H, a softening of the mode from halfway and up to the zone boundary (ZB), like SmS under pressure or signature of electron-phonon interactions. Support of ab initio phonon calculations is needed for further speculations, given the large number of atoms in the unit cell. The speed of sound, roughly estimated from first q point, is v s ~ 3812 m/s. One goal of the experiment was to investigate with IXS the nature of the "Butterfly pattern" features observed below the charge-ordering transition from diffuse scattering in diffraction experiments, in analogy to recent experimental observations for the Verway transition in magnetite. To this end, scans along (4-ζ,4+ζ,0) were performed at selected temperatures, at T=177K, right above the transition, at 207K, 237K, 267K, and 295K. The quasielastic line was extracted from fits to the first acoustic mode, without convoluting to the resolution function. For (3.9 4.1 0) the fitting strategy is more problematic due to the severe overlap between acoustic and quasielastic mode, making an unconstrained fit of relative intensity weight not meaningful; shown is the fit where all the excitation parameters (energy and intensity) were constrained. Results show that the correlations originating in the microscopic distortions accomodating the chargeordering pattern below T CO , which appear as a "butterfly" feature in diffuse scattering, do survive as quasielastic scattering well above the charge-ordering transition and up to room temperature, probably a signature of the underlying polaronic dynamics.</p><p>Scans along (6+ζ,0,0) and (6+ζ,ζ,0) were collected first at room temperature with high statistics at 150sec/pt to characterize the optical phonon excitations, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. In the (6.1,0,0) three modes E 1 =13.4 mev, E 2 =30.2 mev and E 3 =41.2 mev are clearly distinguishable and optical modes energies are compatible with what previously observed in IR spectroscopy at 102 cm -1 , 240 cm - 1 and 320 cm -1 , respectively (Lupi et al. umpublished), while at (6.5,0.5,0) several more modes are excited and the extraction of mode frequencies is less reliable.</p><p>Finally, to investigate possible phonon softening across the Verway transition at q dc =(½ 0 ½ ) , high statistics scans were collected at temperature just above the phase transition. No sign of softening has been observed for the acoustic branch at (3.5,4.5,0). Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the comparison of (6.5,0.5,0) scans at RT and 177K, which does not provide concluding evidence regarding the possible softening of optical modes. More experiments are needed to probe different zones in order to clarify this important aspect of the Verway transition in NaMn 7 O 12 . Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.
