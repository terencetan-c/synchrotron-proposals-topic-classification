<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The first shift was dedicated to beamline alignment and preparation of the setup. We faced a sudden technical issue when we tried to run the experiment. The fuel cell (FC) test station at ID31 had a malfunctioning gauge in the bubbler required for gas humidification. This caused severe flooding of the whole tubing system in the FC test station. We spent two shifts repairing it, and one shift was required just to let the entire system dry out. Due to that, we already started the actual X-ray measurements with one day delay. This is a continuation of MA-5017. From the previous experiment, we reported samples: (i) commercial Pt/C with 0.6 V SW-AST, (ii) oh-PtNiIr with 0.6 V SW-AST, and (iii) oh-PtNiIr with 0.7 V SW-AST. To get a set for publication, we started the CH-6234 experiment with a commercial Pt/C with 0.7 V SW-AST. Due to the experiences acquired during the previous beamtime, we successfully reached high-current densities (~1.2A/cm2 at 0.45 V) and measured stable cyclic voltammetry. However, there were issues with the beam in the storage ring the first night, which caused data loss and delay. Thus, this sample took four shifts to measure. Despite this, we were able to finalize the dataset successfully, and we are now in preparation for the manuscript, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Clearly, the lower potential limit of the fuel cell operation significantly impacts the stability of the catalyst regardless of its composition.</p><p>At this point, we already had just four shifts left. That is why we decided to try a shorter type of accelerated stress test (AST) in which we hold a constant potential for several hours. The first is with the potential hold at 0.6 V, and the second at 0.7 V. We acquired those datasets for two oh-PtNiIr samples. These data will be analyzed in the upcoming months. One additional observation was made. When we compare the high-current operation of the commercial Pt/C and oh-PtNiIr catalyst, we see that oh-PtNiIr performs worse. Despite its higher electrochemical activity, we reached about 0.2 A/cm 2 lower current density at 0.45 V compared to the commercial Pt/C. This might be a consequence of the contamination of the Nafion membrane with Ni ions that leach out during the AST. To confirm this, we designed a new PEM fuel cell optimized for XAS fluorescence, with which we apply for beamtime at ID26. Despite the initial hurdles, this beamtime was a success as we finalized the dataset for publication and acquired new quality data that will provide complementary information once analyzed. Generally, XRD experiments at ID31 ESRF are well suited to enlighten the knowledge gap between laboratory conditions and industrial applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Completed dataset ready for publicationcrystallite size evolution of Pt/C and oh-PtNiIr catalysts during two types of ASTs.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,362.60,520.79,204.40,156.55" type="bitmap" /></figure>
