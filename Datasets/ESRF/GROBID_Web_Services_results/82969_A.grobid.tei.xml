<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>First evidence of photomagnetism in solution</p><p>Experiment number: CH-5012 Beamline: ID12 Date of experiment: from: 4/04/2017 to: 11/04/2017 Date of report: Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): Andrei Rogalev, Fabrice Wilhelm Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Corine Mathonière (ICMCB, University of Bordeaux, France) Panagiota Perlepe (CRPP -ICMCB, University of Bordeaux, France) Amélie Juhin (IPCMC, Université Paris P. M. Curie, Paris, France) Report:</p><p>The objective of the experiment is to study the metal-to-metal electron transfer in cyanido-bridged FeCo squares in solutions.</p><p>This mechanism has been studied in solid state for this compound during previous beam times . Some tests have been done in solutions. The main conclusions were : -the thermal-induced ET on Co and Fe K-edges have been confirmed in solid state and in solutions.</p><p>-the photo-induced ET on Co and Fe K-edges have been confirmed only in solid state.</p><p>-in solutions, the X-ray flow must be reduced to avoid the X-ray induced Co(II) reduction.</p><p>The purpose of this new beamtime is to investigate in detail the photo-induced ET in solutions as this experiment is not possible with other tcchniques used to characterize the ET as magnetometry. The beamline scientists designed a new set-up on ID12 for photoexcitations experiments. This set-up allows the light to be focused on the sample with a power of 4 mW/cm 2 from an external source.</p><p>The selected compound is the square of formula {[(Tp*)Fe(CN) 3 ] 2 [Co(Mebipy) 2 ]}(OTf) 2 / Its properties in solid state and in solutions are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. For this compound, we prepared a solution of the concentration od 1.5 10 -3 mol/L (ie. 19.5 mg dissolved in 6 mL of MeOH). This solution is then inserted in a specific glass cell adapted for the solution measurements.</p><p>We measured: -the XAS spectra for the Co and Fe K-edges at room temperature -the XAS spectra for the Co and Fe K-edges at 215 K and 3 K -the light irradiation with a LED at 940 nm at 3 K on the Co edges.</p><p>The results are given in the next figures. The figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> confirms the ET in solution on the Co K-edge (and also Fe K-edge but not shown here). The figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the XAS measured at 3 K in frozen solution after 1 h, 3 h, and 4 hours of irradiation. We have estimated the conversion at 52 % of Co 3+ in Co 2+ after one hour and 83 % after 4 hours. After these photoexcitation, we also followed the relaxation when the temperature is increasing. These measurements are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Two important informations can be retained from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. First the Co 2+ is still increasing even when the 940 nm-irradiation is stopped. That means that X-ray irradiation has a role in the Co 2+ generation. When the temperature is back at 215 K, the sample is again liquid and we observed a clear Co 3+ signature. This can not be associated undoubtely to the reversibility of the ET process as the point measured in the frozen point is probably not the same than the point measured in solution.</p><p>In parallel, we follow the XAS of the Fe K edges (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The Fe 3+ is reduced in liquid state in Fe 2+ , in full agreement of the thermal-induced ET process. To follow the XAS of the Fe in the frozen solution, it was necessary to modify the position of the X-ray beam on the sample because the crystallized frozen ethanol creates a background diffusion. This is why the spectra at 3 K and 300 K have different baselines. But the information of the oxidation state of the Fe remains correct. It has been possible to conclude that the irradiation is not changing the Fe oxidation state in the frozen solution. With the objective to discriminate the role of X-ray irradiation and 940-nm irradiation we performed an other experiment. We measured the spectra at room temperature (scans Co K-edge #197 and Fe K-edge #198) and went directly at 3 K and irradiated the sample for 3 hours. The XAS of first Fe and then Co K-edges have been measured and correspond mainly to Fe 2+ and Co 3+ (spectra #212 and #213 respectively). These spectra are shown on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. In conclusion form these experiments, it was possible to follow the thermal-induced ET in solution, for both Co and Fe K-edges. At low temperature, it has been complicated to discriminate the effect of the X-ray irradiation and the 940-nm irradiation of the Co edge as the X-ray irradiation is able to photo-reduce the Co. On the other side the Fe is mainly unchanged by light or X-ray irradiation in frozen solution. We conclude that the frozen MeOH can generate electrons that can reduce the Co This is in agreement with papers published several years ago <ref type="bibr">(Moan et al., 1975</ref><ref type="bibr">J. Phys. Chem., 21, 2220;</ref><ref type="bibr">Palumboet al., Astron. Astrophys. 1999, 342, 551)</ref>.</p><p>Perspectives : The MeOH frozen solution forms a crytalline diffusing phase at low temperature which renders the XAS analysis difficult, in particular on the Fe K-edge. Moreover, the frozen MeOH is sensitive to X-ray irradiation by creating radicals and electrons that destroys partially the ET squares. To avoid these problems, an alternative would be the use of a frozen "transparent" and neutral medium to solubilize our compound an create an homogeneous film. We identified the O-terphenyl compound to form a transparent frozen matrix even at low temperature. Further tests of solubility of the square compounds are in progress in our team.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Molecular structure of the electron transfer square (top left).
