<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This work originally aimed to perform in situ high energy X-ray diffraction and XAS analyses during the laser annealing of oxide thin films under different atmospheres. The data would be acquired from Cu2O oxide thin films deposited on glass and Silicon by Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (SALD) previously deposited at LMGP (Grenoble). The objective was to gain insight on the evolution in terms of crystallinity, phase and defects occurring during laser annealing under different atmospheres. XRD data would allow to follow the evolution during the laser annealing (amorphization due to partial melting followed by recrystallization vs. sintering and crystal growth, etc.), while local data obtained from the XAS results will provide insight on the effect of the laser treatment on the defect landscape in the films Laser processing experiments were actually carried out in situ and operando, on Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (SALD) prepared Cu2O films, at the BM25 facility of ESRF between 26 th and 30 th April, 2023. In addition, ex situ experiments were also carried out on SALD deposited ZnO films during 1 st and 2 nd May, 2023, instead of the planned atmosphere controlled experiments, as lab results ready to be published were in accute need of the information that could be obtained from these experiments. For the former, a ns pulsed fiber laser was employed with beam (in situ) and line (operando) scan configurations. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> shows a picture of the in situ laser annealing set up that was used during the experiments. Finally, the beamtime was also used to acquire XAS data of NiOx thin films deposited by SALD using a new precursor.</p><p>The purpose of the experiments was to obtain X-ray diffraction and EXAFS data unavailable with standard laboratory equipment, in order to study crystallographic arrangements and order, as well as other phenomena associated to the interaction of intense laser beams with solid films under very attractive configurations. These will enable scalability of processes and large area processing, as well as control of solid-state chemical transformations and microstructure. For obvious reasons, these methods are being protected from the IP point of view, and are subject to negotiations with an industrial partner, in relation to the SPRINT FET-OPEN project coordinated by the CNRS partner and participated by INMA. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows an example of low power and high power operando measurements, respectively.  Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows absortion spectra of 90 nm thick ZnO thin films after ex situ laser annealing of different pulse durations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. XAS data for ZnO thin films treated ex situ with different lasers.</p><p>The three young scientists (Ph.D. candidates) were heavily and enthusiastically involved in the experiments, along with two senior scientists (Professor level) and the Spline Staff (BM25), who were effectively involved in setting up the experiments and successfully solving any unexpected problem encountered during the installation and operation of the combined laser processing-irradiation set-up. Teamwork was excellent and yielded superb results which open the road to clarify and understand the phenomena taking place during laser surface treatment of SALD deposited films with respect to an increase in crystal order and the chemical changes induced by geometrically dosified laser irradiation. The data obatined during the beam time is being treted and analysed and will be added to manuscripts that are in progress currently. Several manuscripts are expected as an outcome of these experiments, as well as new proposals regarding control of crystallinity and chemistry in laser surface treatment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Germán F. de la Fuente (*), Alejandro Frechilla Zabal (*) from INMA (CSIC-Universidad de Zaragoza) Dr. D.
