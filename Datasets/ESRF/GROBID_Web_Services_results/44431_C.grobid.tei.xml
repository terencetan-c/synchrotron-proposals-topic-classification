<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>a small gold particle was placed in an appropriate distance close to the cell on a silicon nitrite membrane. The holograms were recorded using the coherent beam of ID10.</p><p>In the first set of experiments we used gold particles with 1 µm diameter, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A. Care was taken to place the cell and the gold particle in a section of 10 µm x 10 µm, which is the beam size. Evaporated buffer resulted in slight deposit on the membrane, probably salt. We could record X-ray holograms with high intensity, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>. The reconstructions gave the image of the cell, probably with the nucleus in the centre. The resolution of the image was around 1 µm, as determined by the size of the gold sphere. We realized that experiments with smaller gold particles are feasible, and that better sample preparation procedures are needed to avoid any deposits on the membrane. (B): Zoom in the X-ray hologram of the yeast cell and 1 µm gold sphere. The modulations which encode the phase information are clearly visible (C) Reconstrution of the cell. The image is very blurred because of missing information at small angles and by the use of a large 1 µm gold particle.</p><p>During a second experiment on ID10 we measured a yeast cell with a 250 nm gold particle (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 A</ref>). Modified sample preparation procedures were used and extensive care was taken to avoid any contamination of the sample by remaining salts. We could record a X-ray hologram of a yeast cell and a 250 nm gold particle (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 B</ref>). The obtained reconstruction of the cell is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> C. However, the reconstruction is very blurred due to strong parasitic scattering caused by the slits of the setup and by missing information at small angles. (B) X-ray hologram of the yeast cell and gold sphere measured on ID10 using the old setup. The modulations which encode the phase information are clearly visible (C) Reconstrution of the cell. The image is very blurred because of the strong streaks close to the mask, and by missing information at small angles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (A): Optical image of a yeast cell and a gold sphere of 1 µm diameter on the silicon nitrite membrane.</figDesc></figure>
