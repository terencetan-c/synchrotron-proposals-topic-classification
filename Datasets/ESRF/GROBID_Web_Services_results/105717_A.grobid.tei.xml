<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Ligand-capped colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) derived from lead halide perovskites (LHP), particularly cesium lead halide (CsPbX3; X = Cl, Br, I), represent cutting-edge visible-light-emissive semiconductor NCs. These NCs, typically synthesized via rapid ionic coprecipitation, display remarkable traits such as nearly perfect photoluminescence efficiency and robustness against defects, even without surface passivation. They serve as promising single-photon emitters and exhibit aggregated emissive states, attracting attention across diverse applications like light-emitting diodes, downconversion displays, scintillators, photodetectors, and security tags.</p><p>Despite their swift integration into practical applications, the ongoing synthesis literature continues expanding with varied protocols differing in precursors, ligand chemistry, solvents, surface treatments, and post-synthesis steps. These synthesis endeavors primarily aim to address the challenges posed by the delicate nature of these ionic semiconductors.</p><p>Understanding the formation mechanism of colloidal LHP nanocrystals is crucial for designing new nanostructures, yet reliable data on the pathways from molecular precursors to these structures are scarce.</p><p>Employing synchrotron-based time-resolved in situ small and wide-angle X-ray scattering, we monitored the process of CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, CsPbI3 quantum dot formation in solution via precursors heated in octadecene to a varialble target temperature depending on the halide stoitometry. This investigation provided a comprehensive visualization of the evolution from precursor self-assembly to quantum dot creation.</p><p>During the allocated beamtime, we tracked the in situ transitions from the colloidal suspension to the nanocrystals nucleation and growth using a combination of SAXS and WAXS. In a single experiment, approximately 50 μl of the colloidal precursor suspension was loaded in quartz capilaryand heated to desired anneling temperature.</p><p>The experimental parameters of the beamline were as follows. The energy of the incident X-ray beam was set to 12.23 keV and the beam size was 25 x 25 μm 2 . The SAXS data were recorded by the Eiger2 4M detector at the sample-to-detector distance of 1.52 m. Images were collected with exposure times of 0.2 -0.5 seconds. For the chosen exposure times no beam damage of the sample was observed.</p><p>Monodisperse lead halide perovskite precursors were produced at the KU Leuven by a hot-injection method and stabilized by oleic acid / oleylamine ligands. We studied the effect of the NC chemical composition (CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, CsPbI3), size, as well as shape (cubic or hexagonal particles) on their formation kinetics during the provided beamtime.</p><p>The representative SAXS data revealing a transition from the colloidal precursor suspension into the colloidal quantum dots -visible by the appearance of Bragg reflections -as a function of high-temperature annealing are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Starting from seed, the nucleation and growth of LHPs follow a different pathway depending upon the choce of halide ions, which are the subject of the ongoing analysis.
