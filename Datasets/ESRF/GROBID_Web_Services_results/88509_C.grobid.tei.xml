<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We measured samples of metallic glass Pd40Ni40P20 with different preannealing and mechanical deformation states. The main aim of the experiment was to unveil the differences in microscopic dynamics between the different states. Some results have been published in Preliminary results after a first analysis of the data: 1st sample (ann_ascast): Pd40Ni40P20 rod of 5mm diameter. After casting it was annealed at 250C during 6h. A disk was polished until approx. 40 microns thickness. The disks were cut in four pieces. One piece was introduced in the sample holder for XPCS. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows and example of the change in dynamics at 150C and 200C.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> The g2 functions were calculated and analysed in terms of temperature and waiting time for all te samples measured. For the first sample we show below the obtained g2 functions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and the evolution of the relaxation time (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). A similar study was performed for the following samples. 2nd sample (ann_100HPT): Pd40Ni40P20 rod of 5mm diameter. After casting it was annealed at 250C during 6h. After annealing the sample was deformed by high-pressure torsion for 100 revolutions. Approx. 40 microns thickness. 3rd sample (ann_3HPT): Pd40Ni40P20 rod of 5mm diameter. After casting it was annealed at 250C during 6h. After annealing the sample was deformed by high-pressure torsion for just 3 revolutions. Approx. 40 microns thickness. 4th sample: Pd40Ni40P20 rod of 5mm diameter. After casting it was annealed at 250C during 6h. After annealing the sample was deformed by high-pressure torsion for 10 revolutions. Approx. 40 microns thickness. For this sample only room temperature was measured. 5th sample (asquenched): Pd40Ni40P20 rod of 5mm diameter asquenched. Approx. 40 microns thickness. Same protocol of sample 2 and 3 but only 200C can be reached before finishing the experiment.</p><p>Figure 4 Due to some experimental problems during the first two days we could not follow long isotherms at high temperatures, as we decided that was better to see the differences between samples of different deformation and we had then no time for applying long protocols to various samples. It would be interesting to follow the aging by XPCS at certain temperatures and see the influence of deformation state in to the aging path and the final state reached in a new proposal. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>X</head><figDesc>-ray photon correlation spectroscopy revealing the change of relaxation dynamics of a severely deformed Pd-based bulk metallic glass | Zhou H., Hilke S., Pineda E., Peterlechner M., Chushkin Y., Shanmugam S., Wilde G. | ActaMaterialia, vol.195, p.446-453, 2020.    </figDesc></figure>
