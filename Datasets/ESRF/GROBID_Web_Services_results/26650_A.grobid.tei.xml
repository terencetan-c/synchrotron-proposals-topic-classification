<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The microstructure and composition of two mollusc shells were investigated using a combination of light microscopy, SEM, EPMA, and XANES.The shells of Pinna and Pinctada are composed of calcite prisms separated by organic walls.The prismatic units of Pinna are monocrystalline, and those of Pinctada are polycrystalline with internal organic radial membranes.High-spatial resolution XANES maps for the different S species across adjacent prisms show that sulfate is the principal component in both the intraprismatic organic matrices and the outer membranes. Additionally, these maps confirm that the inner structures of the prismatic units are different for both genera.In many ways, the prisms of Pinna and Pinctada are different and invalidate the "simple prism" concept.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>SUMMARY: The calcitic prisms of the shells of two bivalves, Pinna and Pinctada, are considered simple prisms according to some morphological and mineralogical characteristics. Scanning electron microscopic and atomic force microscopic studies show that the micro-and nanostructures of these two shells are different. Pinna prisms are monocrystalline, whereas Pinctada prisms are not. Moreover, intraprismatic membranes are present only in the Pinctada prisms. The soluble organic matrices extracted from these prisms are acidic, but their bulk compositions differ. Ultraviolet and infrared spectrometries, fluorescence, high pressure liquid chromatography and electrophoresis show that the sugar -protein ratios and the molecular weights are different. Sulfur is mainly associated with acidic sulfated sugars, not with amino acids, and the role of acidic sulfated sugars is still underestimated. Thus, the simple prism concept is not a relevant model for the biomineralization processes in the calcitic prismatic layer of mollusk shells.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Macromol.</head><p>SUMMARY : The soluble organic matrices extracted from the axial part of the skeletons of two Corallium species (Coralliidae, Alcyonacea) were analysed using FTIR spectrometry, HPLC, IEF, 2-D gel electrophoresis and XANES. All these methods show that the main characteristics of the two matrices are similar, but not identical. Both matrices are composed of proteins and sugars; they are acidic with poorly separated molecular weights. The sugars contents are low, and the matrices do not seem highly glycosylated. The differences and similarities of these matrices are also observed in the minor element contents and in the microand nanostructures of the samples. These results confirm the control of the morphology and the chemical composition of calcitic biocrystals. Biomineralisation processes in Coralliidae are taxonomically significant, and differ from those of Scleractinia skeletons.</p><p>To be submitted : DAUPHIN Y., Cuif J.P., Salom√© M., Susini J. -In situ maps using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the sulfur K-edge: an insight to biomineralization process in Mollusc shells -American Mineralogist DAUPHIN Y., Cuif J.P. -Structures and composition of the skeletons of some Merulinidae (Cnidaria, Scleractinia) -J.

Such in-situ biochemical characterisations allow a reliable framework to be created for calibration of biological proxies. Continuous recording of environmental parameters (i.e. temperature, minor element concentrations, etc.) can be correlated to high resolution measurements of isotopic fractionation that were made at the CRPG Nancy (3) allowing an interpretation based on biomineralization process instead of simple chemical precipitation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>organic matrices of the calcitic prismatic shell layers of two pteriomorphid Bivalves: Pinna nobilis and Pinctada margaritifera .
