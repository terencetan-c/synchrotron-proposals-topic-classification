<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Reversible extrusion and uptake of gasphase small molecules by crystalline solids involving metal-ligand bond cleavage and formation Report: Experiment CH-2257 was a great success, indeed well beyond what we had anticipated. The experimental work conducted over two visits to ESRF for six and then nine shifts focussed a family of compounds that we had discovered were able to undergo a reversible reaction involving loss or uptake of HCl (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Remarkably these recations occur within non-porous microcrystalline materials. Thus, there is not only an unexpected capacity for migration of HCl though the crystals but dramatic changes in the molecular moieties and crystal structure results from the chemical reaction leading to release or incorporation of HCl. Specifically salts such 3-halopyridinium tetrachlorocuprate containing two planar cations and a distorted tetrahedral anion and converted to a square planar coordination complex trans-[CuCl 2 (3halopyridine) 2 ] on loss of two equivalents HCl, requiring cleavage of Cu Cl and N H bonds, as well as N H Cl(Cu) hydrogen bonds, and formation of HCl (g) + HCl (g) N H X M Cl Cl Cl M N M Cl X Cl M Figure 1.

The reverse process occurs upon re-uptake of HCl. Prior to the work at ESRF we had been done some preliminary work at SRS and using a laboratory diffractometer to establish that HCl could be removed or added as an aqueous vapour. However, we knew nothing of the reaction rate, the possible involvement of intermediate species or if the uptake reaction could occur in the absence of water.</p><p>Studies of the reactions both in situ and ex situ using ID31 enabled us to establish the reate of reaction and helped establish that the reaction is an equilibrium process. The in situ experiments at modest elevated temperatures (370 K) were possible only because of the high flux and resolution provided by ID31. These characteristics also enabled us to suggest that no crystalline intermediate was formed during the recations. Highly significantly we were able to establish that the uptake reaction can take place in the absence of water since an experimental design provided by the station scientists permitted high quality powder patterens to be obtained using a rotating capillary connected to a cylider supply of dry HCl gas. These studies were published as a full paper in Journal of the American Chemical Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for the system (3-ClpyH) 2 [CuCl 4 ] / trans-[CuCl 2 (3-Clpy) 2 ] (3-Clpy = 3-chloropyridine) together with gas phase infra-red spectroscopy studies. Similar diffraction studies were also conducted on the 4-chloropyridine derivative and following completion of spectroscopic studies we expect to publishe this work also. Some preliminary studies were then conducted during the second visit on related compounds that require loss or uptake of HBr gas. Initial results show similar behaviour, but some marked differences, wherein isostructural bromo and chloro-substituted compunds are converted into non-isostructural compounds following the previously described reactions. The relationship to water may also be different form the bromo derivatives. We also obtained some preliminary results on mixed halide systems that we are using to exlore mechanistic aspects of the reactions since such reactions are not only rare but poorly understood. Some of this work can be published but other results will await further studies before inclusion in publications. These experiments on the bromo derivatives stringly indicate that further study and choice of the right experiments could lead to a signicantly greater understanding of these unusual reactions. A proposal will be submitted to develop these projects further will be submitted and could lead to major breakthoughs in the understanding of these reactions, which have implications in understanding recation processes in a wider range of crsytalline materials.</p><p>During the second period of the experiment (April 2007) an opportuity arose to study a new reaction that also involved coordination bond formation and cleavage in the solid state. Again loss and/or uptake of a vapour, in this case ethanol, involving a non-porous crystalline solid was studied. The compound that exhibited the behaviour is a 1D coordination polymer in which silver perfluorocarboxylate units are linked via tetramethylpyrazine ligands. We had been able to show that ethanol is deinserted leading to formation of a new Ag O(carboxylate) bond and that this process can occur in a single cryustal to single crystal transformation. Reinsertioin of ethanol and reformation of the original structure was clearly demonstrated by the powdr diffraction study conducted at ID31. This work has recently been published again in Angewandte Chemie.</p><p>[2] EtOH + EtOH [Ag 4 (TMP) 3 {O 2 C(CF 2 ) 3 CF 3 } 4 (EtOH) 2 ] n O O Ag O O Ag O H Et [Ag 4 (TMP) 3 {O 2 C(CF 2 ) 3 CF 3 } 4 ] n O O Ag O O Ag </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Local contact(s): Dr Michela Brunelli Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Lee BRAMMER, University of Sheffield, UK Prof. William I.F.
