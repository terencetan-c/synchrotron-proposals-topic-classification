<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Over the three shifts granted by ESRF, the team was able to carry out all the programmed experiments, all repeated twice. These consisted of three different manipulations: 1) Insertion of a short implant into the bone, with fast scans, 2) Insertion of a long implant, twice, with fast scans 3) Insertion of a long implant, at low implantation speed, with fast scans Each experiment was preceded and followed by a high resolution acquisition (3µm).</p><p>In total, including pre-and post-implantation scans, and decoy scans (an aluminium decoy is inserted into the implant well before the implant is placed, in order to reproduce the same grey level attenuations at the implant sites as the implant once in place), 994 scans were recorded for analysis, and 12 implants were placed (6 of each kind, 2 per experiment). Two types of implants were studied: the reference implant (REG), which is the standard today, and a new selftapping implant, which is supposed to create more bone debris, as well as a larger displacement field, in order to achieve better osseointegration.</p><p>To date, analysis has begun, particularly with regard to the bone debris around the implant. Indeed, we have found that high resolution images provide real added value, allowing visualisation of osteocyte sites in the mineral bone. We were also able to observe the bone debris in contact with the implant, which we had not been able to do before with the laboratory tomograph. Figure 2: Bone cell (osteocyte) sites (red arrows) around an aluminium decoy</p><p>Next, DVC analysis of the bone trabeculae around the implant is underway, and should allow us to differentiate between the two types of implants found and to trace the stresses that they generate in the surrounding mineral bone. As these stress distributions are directly related to the quality of osseointegration, we hope to prove with these results that the new implants that are being developed offer better chances of success. Finally, thanks to the reconstructed volumes of the low-speed implantations, the creation of debris by fracturing the bone trabeculae could also be demonstrated, which is a first in the field. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives</head><p>The tests that were carried out highlighted the mechanisms around two types of implants during their insertion into the bone. A second batch of experiments would allow different implant geometries to be tested, and would significantly increase the repeatability of the manipulation (as a reminder, since bone is a biological material, the samples are not identical, so a large number of samples must be tested to make solid conclusions).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: bone debris visualization around the two types of implants: left the autotapping implant, right the reference implant</figDesc><graphic coords="3,121.25,36.85,357.96,245.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
