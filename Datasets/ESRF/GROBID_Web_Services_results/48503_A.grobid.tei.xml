Please see below.</p><p>Our beamline time was on 14 th of July and unfortunately for us, DHL did not deliver our samples one day before our working time. On top of that the 14 th of July was the national day in France and DHL did not work. Thus we could not have any frozen crystals to be tested in ID23-2. Thanks that we brought some small crystals in a crystal tray, we could use our two shifts in ID23-2. Thanks also to the ESRF staff, we had the opportunity to use another beamline, ID14-4, from 5:00 pm (15 th July) to 3:00 am (16 th July). Thus, the report of the experiment MX 1335 contained the results obtained in both beamlines.</p><p>Results:</p><p>-Ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (FNR) from pea: We managed to get diffraction data at 2.8 Å of C266M mutation (pointed to be involved in electron transfer during catalysis). The rest of the crystals of mutants localised in C266 and L268 positions diffracted very poorly (higher than 4 Å). X-data from C266M FNR was processed at home and the structure solved. C266M FNR crystals belonged to the P2 1 2 1 2 1 orthorhombic space group and the unit cell dimensions were a=73.7, b=91.7 and c=139.8 Å. The crystal structures of C266M and L268V mutants (L268V data collected in a previous trip with experiment number MX-1230) have been compiled with biophysical characterisation of these two mutants, and a manuscript is under preparation at the moment. At present we are carrying out new trials of crystallisation of other mutants in order to get more insights into catalysis.</p><p>-FAD synthetase: The crystals of FAD synthetase from C. ammoniagenes complexed with the cofactor FAD did not diffract well and no good datasets could be obtained.</p><p>Unlike the full-length protein, crystals of the C-terminal domain (Riboflavin Kinase module, RFK) cocrystallised with ATP diffracted at 2.6 Å. The crystal was processed and solved by molecular replacement. The location of ATP was determined and now we can compare it with a large number of crystal structures with other complexes that we have previously determined. Soon, we will publish all the structural work together with kinetic data of this domain.</p><p>-POFUT1</p><p>We had different crystals of catalytic mutants in complex with GDP-fucose, but unfortunately these crystals did not diffract well. We are trying now to get new conditions in order to get the structures of these mutants in complex with GDP-fucose.</p><p>We also brought untested crystals of POFUT1 in complex with an EGF-like repeat unit. These crystals diffracted very well and we managed to solve the crystal structure at 2.02 Å. The crystals belonged to P212121 space group and the unit cell dimensions were a=84, b=89 and c=100 Å. The structure showed a complex of POFUT1 with this peptide but in an unproductive conformation. Although it is an interesting data, we are now trying to get different crystallisation conditions in order to get a productive conformation. We are also currently carrying out biophysical experiments in order to understand the significance of the unproductive conformation.</p><p>In general we managed to get all the information that we initially wanted despite all the problems. Furthermore we have our first manuscript of POFUT1 crystal structure in press (accepted in PLoS ONE) and two other manuscripts under preparation.</p></div>		</body>
