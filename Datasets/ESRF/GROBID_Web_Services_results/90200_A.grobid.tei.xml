<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>High-temperature crystallographic behavior of In2Se3 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our proposal, we showed that the phase-transition behavior and the crystal structures of In 2 Se 3 are not fully understood. Literature phase-transition temperatures show a large spread, and most high temperature crystal structures were not refined.</p><p>During our measurements at beam line ID22 at the ESRF, we successfully measured the high-temperature behavior of three different In 2 Se 3 polymorphs that are stable or metastable at room temperature: 2H-α, 3R-α and γ. We used a standard experimental setup for hightemperature diffraction measurements with a hot air blower as proposed.</p><p>Starting from γ-In 2 Se 3, we could observe a phase-transition into δ-In 2 Se 3 at 575 °C, which is stable up to at least 800 °C. We used a diffraction pattern at 700 °C to solve and refine the crystal structure of δ-In 2 Se 3 . It crystallizes in space group with Se-In-Se-In-Se layers (In1: 2d, z = 0.8010(3), Se1: 1a, and Se2: 2d, z = 0.3353(4)). All In atoms are coordinated octahedrally by six Se atoms. The crystal structure is polytypic to 3R-β-In 2 Se 3 with the Bi 2 Te 3 structure type, but with a different translational symmetry along c. The crystal structure of δ-In 2 Se 3 is projected in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. To best of our knowledge, this is the first time that atomic positions of this phase were refined. Starting from 3R-α-In 2 Se 3, we observed a phase-transition into 3R-β-In 2 Se 3 at 175 °C. Here, the tetrahedrally coordinated In atom changes into an octahedral coordination (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Using the high-resolution diffraction data, we were able to refine the crystal structure of 3Rβ-In 2 Se 3 and determine atomic positions. By heating up 3R-β further, it transforms into γ-In 2 Se 3 starting at 350 °C. The transition showed a very broad temperature range and was not completed until heating to 525 °C. We know from previous experiments that tempering In 2 Se 3 at 400 °C leads to phase-pure γ-In 2 Se 3 . Therefore, the transition is rather kinetically than thermodynamically controlled which might explain the varying transition temperatures reported in the literature. Upon further heating the sample transforms to δ-In 2 Se 3 at 575 °C, which is in line with the transition temperature which we observed for the first sample. In our proposal we showed that we were able to develop a structure model for 2H-α-In 2 Se 3 from electron microscopy, DFT calculations and in-house XRD measurements. With the help of the high-resolution XRD measurements from ID22, we were able to refine the atomic positions of 2H-α-In 2 Se 3 for the first time. It consists of five different atomic sites and forms Se-In-Se-In-Se layers (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) within space group P6 3 mc. By heating 2H-α-In 2 Se 3 , a phase transition is observed at 200 °C. This phase above 200 °C shows a hexagonal lattice. By considering the transformation between 3R-α and 3R-β (coordination change of one In atom) we assumed the same transition for 2H-α-In 2 Se 3 and developed a structure model consisting of Se-In-Se-In-Se layers with octahedrally coordinated In atoms (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). We refined the model with the XRD data at 250 °C. To best of our knowledge, the phase was never reported before. The experimental setup of measuring in sealed capillaries results in a strong temperature gradient, since only a small part of the capillary is heated with the hot air blower. At high temperatures (above 800 °C) we observed significant sublimation of In 2 Se 3 within the capillaries. This probably resulted in an unfortunate compositional change. Therefore, the XRD measurements during the cooling process could not be reproduced, for trivial reasons. An experimental setup where the entire sample container is heated homogeneously will be necessary to arrive at reproducible results during the cooling process. The results we could make in the measurements during the heating steps already significantly improve the understanding of the crystallization behavior of In 2 Se 3 . A manuscript regarding the results is in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Michael Küpers, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, RWTH Aachen;* Philipp Konze, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, RWTH Aachen;* Prof. Dr. Richard Dronskowski, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Jülich-Aachen Research Alliance (JARA), RWTH Aachen.</figDesc></figure>
