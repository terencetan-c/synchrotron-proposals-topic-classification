As shown, in both cases and for both technologies, the peak tends to shift towards lower 2 values which, according to Bragg's law, could be attributed to a thermal expansion of the crystal lattice. It should be pointed out that the shift of the diffraction peak is more noticeable when the diode is subjected only to temperature. This could be due to either the current intensity applied does overheat the diode at such high temperatures (diodes usually work at 40 A), or the current inducing mechanical stress or other phenomena that shift the diffraction peak in the opposite direction to that caused by temperature. Note that the Si plane is different for each experiment. This is due to the impossibility of cross-section the diode in a notrandom direction. Results also reveal that the diffraction peak of the Schottky diode appears at lower 2 values than the one corresponding to the MOS diode. This occurs even at room temperature and may be indicating that the initial conditions of the crystal lattice of Si are different for each one. We can associate these variations with either the stress caused by the dopants in the Si structure, which differs from one technology to the other for having different doping schemes; or with the stress generated during the manufacturing process. However, as the provider of both diodes is the same, it is assumed that the differences in the latter are negligible.</p><p>(b) (a) (b) (a) Clamps Sample holder Diode Diode Baby chamber Clamps 50.4 50.6 50.8 51.0 Normalized intensity (arb. u.) 2 (º) MOS (660) 0 A 1 A 3 A 5 A 8 A 16.8 16.9 17.0 17.1 Normalized intensity (arb. u.) 2 (º) 21 ºC 45 ºC 80 ºC 140 ºC 200 ºC 260 ºC Schottky (220) 16.8 16.9 17.0 17.1 Normalized intensity (arb. u.) 2 (º) 21 ºC 45 ºC 80 ºC 140 ºC 195 ºC 240 ºC MOS (220) 50.4 50.6 50.8 51.0 Normalized intensity (arb. u.) 2 (º) 0 A 1 A 3 A 5 A 8 A Schottky (660) (a) (b) (c) (d) TEMPERATURE CURRENT</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Press-fit rectifier diodes are commonly employed in the automotive field for the transformation of the alternating current (AC) provided by the alternator into direct current (DC), in order to be suitable for powering the vehicle. A critical issue for the reliability of the diodes is the appearance of undesirable effects during their performance, such as overheating by the Joule effect or thermomechanical stresses, as a consequence of the high electrical current they endure.</p><p>These devices are basically constituted by a semiconductor element, a metallic heat sink and a mechanically protective epoxy. The former defines the performance of the diode, depending on the technology it presents (metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS), Schottky, PN-junction, etc.).</p><p>Thus, the goal of this proposal was to assess in situ the crystallographic modifications occurring in the semiconductor component of commercial press-fit rectifier diodes with different technology (MOS and Schottky) while they are under operating conditions. Samples were evaluated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique at the BM25-SpLine beamline at an energy of 18.26 keV. As it is a superficial technique, measurements were performed on the cross-section of diodes. For that, they were cut and mirror-polished following a specific procedure with various steps involving sanding using papers with different grain sizes and polishing with diamond and silica.</p><p>Once the diodes were prepared, two different experiments, consisted of the acquisition of -2 spectra and reciprocal space maps (RSM) of the semiconductor component (Si) while the diode was subjected to operating conditions, were performed. In one of them, a forward current was applied at different intensities, and data were taken each time the current was increased after letting the sample stabilize for about 5 min. In the other one, diodes were subjected solely to heating, and measurements were acquired at selected temperatures after the sample was thermally homogenized for about 5 min. The setup of both current and temperature experiments are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a) and (b), respectively.</p></div>			</div>
