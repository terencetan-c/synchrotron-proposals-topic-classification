An Xray scattering analysis.</p><p>Experiment number: LS-2995 Beamline: ID13 Date of experiment: from: 24.02.2021 to: 28.02.2021 Date of report: 18.04.2021 Shifts: 12 Local contact(s): BURGHAMMER Manfred LIU Jiliang Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Liraz Chai Institute of Chemistry The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Jerusalem 91904-Israel</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment LS-2995 was performed on the microbranch of ID13 with a beamsize of (2x2) m² -(10x10) m² at an energy of 13 keV with exposure times between 20 ms and 1 s per point.</p><p>The aim of the project was to elucidate the XRD/XRF signatures of intact biofilms and to map them on the micron scale (within the radiation damage limits). This beamtime continued LS2951. In LS2995 we ellaborated the measurements with WT biofilms and mapped larger areas in three areas: biofilm periphery and two areas towards the middle of the biofilms. In this beamtime we corroborated the contribution of the ECM components to the WT XRD fingerprint, and we ruled out the contribution of cells and spores to this signal. In addition to XRD, we measured the XRF signal from WT and mutant biofilms. Finally, we managed to obtained a clean (background-free) signal from three prtoein (TasA) samples that were mounted between silicon nitride membranes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>LS2951 focused on the XRD signal of WT biofilms. We previsously hypothesized that the WT doublet may originate from the TasA protein that is present in the biofilms' spores. An important control at LS2995 that was conducted at LS2995 shows that the spores cannot account for the doublet observed in biofilms, and that it is unique to biofilms (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, a peak at ~ 7.89 nm-1 (corresponding to d ~ 7.95 Å) appears both in biofilms and in the spore sample. Further to LS2951, here we measured the XRF from WT biofilm colonies, and showed that in agreement with our previous ICP-MS studies <ref type="bibr">(Ido Nir et al., PCCP, 2020)</ref>, XRF confirms the accumulation of metal ions in biofilms. Surprisingly, the metals accumulate in the wrinkles area and they trace the morphology of the wrinkes in biofilms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Finally, we managed to elucidate the XRD fingerprint of isolated protein fibers, and confirmed that they cannot account for the dominant structure in intact biofilms. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the 2D and 1D XRD patterns measured from TasA protein 'chunks' in acid and in high salt concentrations, indicating that the protein itself cannot account for the doublet observed in WT biofilms. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows that isolated TasA fibers can bind metal ions (in particular Zn, Fe, Mn).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figures.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. XRD measured from WT biofilm (black) and spores only (red). Data is normalized and zoomed into so that the doublet (marked with a circle) is observed. The doublet at ~ 6.2, 6.6 nm -1 appears in WT biofilms, but not in spores only. However, the peak at ~ 7.89 nm -1 (marked with an arrow) appears in both samples.  The XRF maps expose differences in fibrilar morphology, that matches the differences in metal ion binding. Specifically, in fibers formed in a salt environment (C), iron (red) binding is observed within distinctively straight fibers, while iron and zinc appears to be distributed in larger areas where the fibers assemble into a mesh (red and green appearing yellow). In fibers formed in an acidic environment (B), iron binding dominates over zinc binding, that is observed as speckles in the background of the XRF map, and at high salt concentrations (protein was not cleaned with gel filtration) (A), zinc is dominating. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.

XRF map measured in the location shown in (A) is shown in (B) for calcium and (C) for iron. x,y axes on (B,C specify distance in milimeters. Remarkably, the XRF map follows the morphology of the wrinkle with great detail, owing to the high resolution at ID13.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.96,217.32,510.24,105.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
