<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Surfactant mediated film formation of 2D materials at the air-water interface </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal Objective</head><p>In this proposal, we want to understand the precise role that the surfactant monolayers at the air-water interface play for the reaction dynamics of 2D polymers (2DPs) using surfactant monolayer-assisted interfacial synthesis (SMAIS). The final goal is to investigate the relation between different surfactant monolayers, the supramolecular pre-organization of monomers, and eventually the crystallinity of the resultant 2DPs. In this particular proposal, we will focus on the first two steps of the SMAIS process, the surfactant monolayer formation and the conformational orientation of the monomers at the surfactant layer. The formation of the surfactant is only the first step in the SMAIS process, but is crucial for the pre-organization of the monomer and eventually the polymerization of the 2DP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The first task before being able to analyze the acquired data was to convert it into 2D-maps in Q-space, which could be imported into our visualisation and analysis software WxDiff. With the help of Oleg Konovalov we were able to write a python code to convert the acquired data into binary files with quadratic pixel sizes, which allows the data analysis with WxDiff.</p><p>With the data conversion taken care of, we first focused on the monolayer assembly of the various tested surfactants. Within this report, we will turn our attention to the surfactants octadecylamine (ODA) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and mixtures of these two used in a small rectangular PTFE trough with water as subphase. The molecular structure of the two surfactants is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. The in-plane intensity profiles of the pure surfactants and various mixing ratios of the two are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>. There it can be seen that the position of the diffraction peaks is changing for different mixing ratios. For the pure ODA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> left) we observe two diffraction peaks at 1.51 Å -1 and 1.67 Å -1 . These peaks are very similar to other ionic surfactants like sodium oleyl sulfate and represent a 2D unit cell with a = 7.5 Å b = 5.0 Å and γ = 90°. The diffraction pattern of a mixture of ODA:SDBS with a ratio of 9:1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> middle) showed a significant change with peaks at 1.25 Å -1 , 2.16 Å -1 and 2.50 Å -1 . These peaks can be indexed as the 01, 11 and 02 planes of a unit cell with a = 5.81 Å, b = 5.81 Å and γ = 120°. For the mixing ratios of 8:2 and 7:3 there is almost no change to the position of the diffraction peaks. The diffraction pattern then changes again significantly when using a ratio of 6:4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> right). We can now observe two peaks at 1.42 Å -1 and 1.50 Å -1 . With only these two peaks visible it is difficult to index them and assign a unit cell since there a multiple solutions that could result in this pattern.</p><p>One possible solution with a = b that can explain the peaks is a = 4.93 Å, b = 4.93 Å and γ = 63.8°. For verification of this unit cell either additional measurements for example in a langmuir trough with defined surface pressure or theoretical calculations will be necessary. If we add even more SDBS to the ODA, e.g. 5:5 or 3:7, the diffraction signals completely disappear indicating the loss of structural order of the surfactant film. This seems to fit with the fact that the pure SDBS also does not show any diffraction peaks leading to the conclusion that the order in the layer is lost when the SDBS becomes dominant. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p>Further analysis of the collected data is currently ongoing with a focus on the monomer assembly. Now that we have seen that we are able to relaibly collect data for various monolayers of surfactants and the assembly of some of our monomers we are planning to submit a proposal that builds on the results of this beamtime and focuses on the polymerization after the surfactant mediated assembly of the monomers. We expect to be able to publish the combined results in a high-impact journal due to the novelty of studying the polymerization process of 2D polymers by in-situ GIWAXS experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Mike Hambsch, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany* Anupam Prasoon, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany* Ye Yang, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany* Stefan Mannsfeld, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany Report:</figDesc></figure>
