<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We are investigating photon induced polymerization and depolymerization propagation in two-dimensional polymer crystals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Of particular interest is the real crystal structure on the local scale, which is analyzed using diffuse scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, to better understand the polymerization mechanism and the stability of the polymers. Trifunctional monomer molecules suitable for two-dimensional polymerization were crystalized. These molecules form new bonds between them when irradiated with blue light. This process can be reversed by heat treatment. We collected Bragg and diffuse datasets at 100 K using a wavelength of 0.6935 Å and a Pilatus 2M detector. The Bragg datasets were measured as single 360° ϕ-scans with fine slicing of 0.1° and exposure time of 0.1 s per frame. The diffuse scattering datasets were collected by four repetitive 360° ϕ-scans with fine slicing of 0.1° and exposure time of 1.0 s per frame. The repetitive scans as well as the increased exposure time were required to collect the weak diffuse scattering with sufficient intensity. A welcomed side effect of repetitive scans is that potential beam damage could be identified. Fortunately, none of the crystals showed any signs of beam damage. We encountered two major problems during the measurements. First, during our preliminary on-site data evaluation, we found an unwanted, regular spiking of the R int value. Thanks to the staff at the beamline, including Alexey Mikheykin and Dmitry Chernyshov, we were able to identify the problem as a malfunction of the used cryostat. The cryostat was exchanged and thus the problem solved. The beamline's staff showed us how to use established software to correct for these problems in our Bragg datasets. For our diffuse scattering datasets, symmetry averaging and outlier rejection is the best approach to correct for this problem.</p><p>Second, we noticed a drop in beam intensity after the first couple of experiments. A realignment of the monochromator crystal solved this problem. It was probably caused by a warming up of the monochromator crystal after the beam down-time. We encountered no further obstacles. The raw data looks very promising. The Bragg datasets are used to monitor and quantify the cell parameters, the polymerization conversion and the reorientation of the trapped and partially disordered solvent molecules. In the beginning of the polymerization reaction, the peaks are intense, sharp and scatter to high 2θ angles. After the reaction had finished, we observed a very fine, but still unexplained, reflection splitting, which we could not see with our in-house diffractometer. The reflection intensities are reduced and fewer reflections are observed along the c* direction. Upon polymerization, the unit cell slightly expands, but upon depolymerization, the c-axis first abruptly decreases and then steadily increases again and reaches the original unit cell dimensions prior to polymerization. The 2-cyanopyridine solvent molecules are responsible for the crystals electric dipole momentum. The solvent molecules partially reorient themselves upon polymerization, and we calculated the accompanying change in electric dipole momentum. The recorded diffuse scattering shows a rich variety of features. We were able to observe cloud-and streak-like features and diffuse maxima at systematically extinct Bragg positions.</p><p>During the first qualitative assessment, we were already able to attribute some of these features to different structural changes during polymerization and depolymerization. For example, the diffuse scattering maxima at systematically extinct Bragg positions appear after the polymerization has started and disappear upon full conversion. Since the unpolymerized and fully polymerized states are fully ordered, this type of diffuse scattering is likely caused by the distribution of bonded and non-bonded monomer molecules. Interestingly, the diffuse scattering is different for the polymerization and depolymerization reaction. Data evaluation is well under way. The Bragg datasets pose no particular challenge in processing and interpreting, with exception of the reflection splitting. We are currently completing the evaluation and preparing a manuscript which focuses on the findings from the Bragg datasets, such as the hysteresis of the cell parameters. In the processing of the diffuse scattering datasets, we are faced with typical problems, namely background treatment and Bragg reflection masking. Unlike Bragg scattering, diffuse scattering data evaluation is in general very challanging and standard software is not available. Therefore, custom made algorithms and computer programs are necessary for further data processing. A powerful algorithm for Bragg peak masking has already been established and the background correction algorithm is currently under development. Some of the obtained results were already presented during the Meeting of the German Crystallographic Society 2016 in Germany as an oral and poster contribution, at the Two-Dimensional Synthetic Polymer Conference 2016 in Japan as an oral contribution and during the European Crystallographic Meeting 2016 in Switzerland as a poster contribution.</p><p>Thanks to the beamline staff and their instrumentation, we were able to collect data of very high quality which also finds recognition in the scientific community.</p></div>		</body>
