<div><head>Aim</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to perform in situ X-ray μCT experiment (up to 200 °C, 20 MPa) to investigate the effect of pore fluid pressure, confining pressure, and temperature on the dynamics of reaction-induced porosity during the replacement of calcite by magnesite, brucite, gypsum, and anhydrite. This should help more accurate reactive transport modelling for minerals exploration, sustainable metal extraction, and <rs type="grantNumber">CO2</rs> sequestration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The X-ray μCT study was carried out at the ID19 microtomography beamline in September 2022 -October 2022 using the Hades deformation rig. The calcite precursors were particle size of 53-150 μm, fitted in a Viton sample jacket with a 5 mm inside diameter and a length of 10 mm. Data were collected for calcite at two temperatures (60 and 200 °C) and two pore pressures (3 and 6 Mpa). We acquired tomograms with all three offered resolutions of 1x, 5x and 10x magnification (6, 1.25 and 0.6 μm/voxel side length, respectively). This is to observe the porosity changes within the particulates at a high resolution alongside the full view of the entire core sample with a low resolution.</p><p>During the original experimental time in Sep/Oct 2022, communications broke down between the beam line and the control system, this was not possible to fix during the remainder of our beam time. Ben generously used some of his commissioning time to complete this set of data collection in April 2023.</p><p>These in situ experiments were incredibly challenging. A data processing protocol has been developed to get total porosity as a function of reaction time, sample volume as a function of reaction time, reaction extent as a function of reaction time and spatial location of the core sample, and the mechanism of wormhole formation during the reaction. Data processing and interpretation is on-going.</p><p>The solid samples from the in-situ experiments were recovered and have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction to confirm mineral phases, scanning electron microscopy to examine texture, and energy dispersive spectroscopy to measure elemental distribution. These data will be used to assist the inteptretation of in situ experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact</head><p>In conjunction with ex-situ data, the data from in-situ experiments will be published and will form a major chapter of Khairul Khairudin's PhD thesis, which will be submitted in 2024.</p></div>			</div>
