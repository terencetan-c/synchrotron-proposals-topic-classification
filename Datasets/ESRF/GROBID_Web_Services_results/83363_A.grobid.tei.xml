<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>For this experiment, we were allocated 9 shifts (3 days), instead of the 12 initially requested due to a highly-competitive round of proposals.</p><p>The experimental setup, aiming for a resolution of 0.7 Âµm, used an indirect detector microscope in high dose configuration and a PCO.edge gold 4.2 camera. Phase contrast was performed, adapting the propagation distance to the energy. We applied a range of energies: 19 keV (that proved inadequate for achieving satisfying results with most samples), 35 keV (adequate for most extant taxa), 69 keV (adequate for most fossil fragments), 112 keV (used for some of the biggest extant and fossil specimens). Scanning time was variable, depending on the size of the specimen. It was substantially longer for bigger specimens consisting in entire bones.</p><p>During this experiment we were able to scan a total of 93 specimens:</p><p>-59 fossil specimens (fragments of/complete lower jaw bones) -34 extant specimens (complete lower jaw bones).</p><p>We received the complete dataset in mid-August 2017, meaning that most of the data has not been treated yet.</p><p>Based on the data we've treated so far (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), the experimental setup was adequate, allowing us to:</p><p>-accurately visualise bone cell lacunae, -reconstruct them in 3D, -measuring their volumes using tools incorporated into the software VGStudio Max. [left]: reconstructed virtual section of a lower jaw bone fragment from the Jurassic fossil fish Pachycormus, clearly showing osteocyte lacunae (black lenticular structures) due to adequate phase contrast.</p><p>[right]: 3D thin section of the rib of an extant carp (Cyprinus), with osteocyte lacunae reconstructed in 3D and coloured according to their measured volume.</p><p>The numerous and high-quality data obtained at the ESRF will then be at the core of our collaborative scientific project, aiming at reconstructing genome size variations in teleost evolution.</p></div>			</div>
