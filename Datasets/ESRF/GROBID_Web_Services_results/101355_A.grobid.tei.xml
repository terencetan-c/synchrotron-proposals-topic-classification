Experiments were performed in a 6-6 configuration (i.e., using a cubic cell assembly). The XRD data were collected using monochromatic beam and a Pilatus 2D detector. The data were processed by sequential Rietveld refinement. At low pressures (&lt; 1 GPa), results show, as previously documented, that the lattice parameters of quartz increase dramatically when approaching the transition in the alpha field, then remain constant despite increasing T in the beta field. At high pressures however, the results show a much smoother transition.</p><p>The main result from that first round of investigation was therefore the successful and accurate monitoring of the transition across a range of PT conditions. The aim of the present proposal was thus to combine these high PT XRD data with measurements of sound velocities to provide full constraints on the effect of this transition on seismic velocities in the conditions of the Earth's lower crust Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Results from ES-1211 showing (A) evolution of the two main reflections of quartz (100 and 011) and (B) p-wave velocity while the pressure was ramped up and down at constant rates. The transition is evidenced in the former data by pronounced peak position shifts (dashed lines) and also clearly identified in the latter on both the up-and downpressure paths by a minimum in velocity. Velocity is here approximated assuming a constant sample length equal to that of the initial length and a reference velocity of quartz, Vp0, calculated for given PT conditions.</p><p>Moarefvand, A., Gasc, J., Fauconnier, J., Baïsset, M., Burdette, E., Labrousse, L., Schubnel, A. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>(Sheehan et al., 2014). The approach was to use an already established acoustic setup that uses a 6-8 configuration of the LVP (octahedron cell), where an acoustic transducer is used to collect pulse-echo waveforms and determine travel times of P and S-waves in the sample (Thomson et al., 2019). The experimenters benefitted from invaluable user support from Dmitrii Druzhbin and Wilson Crichton for both sample preparation and data collection. Three attempts were made over the course of 15 shifts in this beamtime. The first two were unsuccessful due to failures of the acoustic sensor and of the heater. The third attempt was successful and allowed us to collect both XRD and acoustic data. This sample was cycled multiple times across the A-B transition by varying either P or T up and down during a total of 8 shifts. Preliminary data reduction shows a very good correlation between phase change and both compressional and shear wave velocities (Vp and Vs), which, as expected, decrease with increasing temperature in the alpha field, then increase to higher values in the beta field upon further heating (Moarefvand et al., 2021). Subsequent refinements, in particular regarding the evolution of the sample length observed by X-ray absorption images, will allow quantifying accurately the relations between P, T, Vp and Vs (Figure 1). It is the first time such data are collected in the actual conditions of the Earth's deep crust. In the future (proposal ES1364), we plan to round off this dataset by collecting similar data in a 6-6 configuration where the effects of stress can be assessed and quantified by performing azimuthal XRD scans with the detector, as also successfully achieved during ES910.</figDesc></figure>
