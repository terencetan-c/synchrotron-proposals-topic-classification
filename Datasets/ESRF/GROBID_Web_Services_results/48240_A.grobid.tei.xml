<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>The goal of the experiments was to provide in-situ density data and to determine the equation of state of dry and volatile-bearing (water and CO 2 ) phonolitic liquids for the pressure-temperature (P-T) range related to midocean ridges, subduction zones and continental rifting using X-ray absorption. During the allocated beamtime at ESRF ID27, experiments were performed using a panoramic Paris-Edinburgh Press (PE Press). We were able to systematically measure the absorption contrast of dry, hydrous and carbonbearing phonolitic melts as a function of pressure (1 to 3.1 GPa) , temperature (1600 to 2000K) and water content of 0 and 4.7 wt% as well as a CO 2 content of 1.7 wt%. All samples had been synthesized in a pistoncylinder apparatus and characterized (compositional analyses, density measurements and FTIR analyses) prior the beamtime at ETH Zurich. The run products of the experiments have been analysed for water and carbon using FTIR spectroscopy and electron microprobe. Unfortunately, these analyses indicate that CO 2 and water were (partially) lost from the capsules during the experiments. As a consequence, we have successfully derived the equation of state from the measured X-ray absorption contrast for volatile-free phonolite liquids, but need additional experiments to do so for the volatile-bearing liquids. A proposal with this aim will be submitted for the next call for proposals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Setup:</head><p>High pressure and temperature experiments were generated in a panoramic PE press, using 7 mm tungsten carbide anvils. The sample containers consisted of natural single crystal diamond cylinders (Almax Industries, Belgium) with Ø in = 0.5 mm, Ø out = 1.5 mm and a height of 1.0 mm. The capsule was sealed by Pt disks (200 µm) on both sides and enclosed in an hBN cylinder and two hBN caps were placed on both ends acting as pressure-transmitting medium. The furnace assembly is placed inside a standard 7 mm boron gasket. The absorption scans were collected with two ionization chambers and at a relatively low X-ray energy (Mo edge, 20.0 keV) for an optimal absorption contrast. Two different pressure marker (hBN and Pt) were used to determine the pressure and temperature by X-ray diffraction from the respective equations of state. After verifying the liquid state of the sample by X-ray diffraction, absorption scans of the assembly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>) were collected. 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10 10.1 10.2 10.3 0.58 0.6 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 0.7 0.72 0.74 0.76 0.78 Position (mm) Absorbance dry phonolitic melt residual µ = 0.2935, radius 0.2497 1.1 GPa 1726 K µ PT b a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion:</head><p>We performed a total of 7 experiments on volatile free, hydrous and carbon-bearing phonolitic melt, 5 runs in June and 2 runs in August. We successfully and systematically collected absorption scans of dry, hydrous and CO 2 -bearing melts in the PT range from 0.6 to 3.1 GPa and 1600 to 2000 K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Contrary to previous experiments (report , we had no problems with failed experiments and this allowed us to collect more data more efficiently. We fitted the dry density data using the 3 rd order BM equation to get the EoS for the dry phonolitic melt and this equation allows us, for the first time, to predict the density of phonolitic liquids within 2%. The collected absorption scans for the hydrous and carbon-bearing phonolitic melts were of excellent quality, but we had a significant loss of volatiles, in contrast with the hydrous rhyolite samples (HS-4216). The FTIR spectra in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> demonstrate the loss of water from 4.7 to 2.7 wt% after the experiment. We suspect the loss of water happens when a fluid phase is exsolved during heating/crystallization and expect to overcome this problem by applying a faster heating rate. The FTIR spectra in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref> indicate the complete loss of CO 2mol and CO 3 2-and addition of a significant amount of water. We suspect that the experiments with the carbon-bearing phonolitic melts were performed in a too reduced environment. A possible explanation could be the conversion of CO 2 into C by the following equation: 4 H + + 2 CO 2 = 2 H 2 O + C. Thus, to avoid this problem in future experiments, we need to keep the system more oxidized, for example by replacing hBN by MgO and/or adding Fe 2 O 3 to the assembly.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications:</head><p>The performed experiments provide a first experimentally derived equation of state of dry phonolitic melts. We can now accurately predict the density of dry phonolitic melts in the range of 1-3 GPa and 1400K-2000K. With these data we can better understand magma migration in the continental rift zone settings. A paper on the dry phonolite density is in preparation for Geophysical Research Letters. In order to determine the partial molar volume of water and CO 2 more data are needed for volatile bearing melts. 3800 4000 4200 4400 4600 4800 5000 5200 5400 5600 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 wave number (cm-1) absorbance before experiment after experiment 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 wave number (cm-1) absorbance before experiment after experiment 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Pressure GPa Temperature K a b 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 Pressure (GPa) Density (g/cm 3 )</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Fit of absorption profiles a) Dry phonolite at 1.1 GPa and 1726 K as a function of the position of the sample. b) The density was determined from the X-ray absorption contrast between the sample and the diamond capsule.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,163.45,706.73,134.41,115.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
