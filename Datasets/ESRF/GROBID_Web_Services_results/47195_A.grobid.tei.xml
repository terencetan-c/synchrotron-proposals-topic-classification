<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study focuses on the first occurrence of either cavitation or crystal shear in relation to temperature and microstructure during the tensile drawing of polyethylene. Four high density polyethylenes covering a range of crystallinity have been thermally treated to generate different microstructures displaying a large range of crystal thickness from 8 to 29 nm. The testing temperature spanned the domain 25 e100 C. In-situ SAXS measurements on synchrotron have been performed to capture the initiation of cavitation in parallel with stress-strain measurements. Depending on microstructure and temperature the strain onset of cavitation proved to be either before or after yielding associated with homogeneous or localized cavitation regimes respectively. The transition between the two regimes can be defined by a critical value of lamella thickness at each temperature. A physical modeling based on a thermally activated nucleation process has been developed for predicting the macroscopic stress for generation of cavities as well as the one for initiating crystal shearing. This modeling accounts for both temperature and microstructure effects on yielding. It allows describing successfully the delayed apparition of cavitation with increasing temperature and decreasing crystal thickness. The observation of complete disappearance of cavitation at high temperature is also predicted by the model in relation to crystal thickness. The more relevant aspects as well as the shortcomings of the model are discussed in the conclusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Semi-crystalline polymers constitute the larger part of commodity and specialty thermoplastics for structural applications so that it is a major issue to be able to predict their macroscopic mechanical behavior. Cavitation and crystal shear are two major processes involved in the plastic yielding <ref type="bibr">[1e4]</ref>. It seems that these processes can be activated concomitantly or competitively under tensile loading depending on the materials structure and experimental conditions <ref type="bibr">[5e26]</ref>.</p><p>Historically, the interest for strain-induced cavitation in thermoplastic polymers was aroused by the discovery of crazing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> that has been mainly studied at the mesoscale of craze widening, i.e. far beyond that of the lamellar structure for semicrystalline polymers. Regarding crystal shear, this aspect of the plastic behavior of semi-crystalline polymers has been extensively investigated from a metallurgical standpoint owing to the similarity with metallic materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. It is worth noticing that these processes are precursory to the fragmentation and fibrillar transformation of the crystalline lamellae beyond yielding, possibly accompanied with a melting-recrystallization <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>Number of authors suspect that cavitation is an actual damaging process that should be considered into mechanical models. However, the contribution of cavitation has been almost ignored so far in the approaches for predicting the mechanical behavior of semicrystalline polymers, and thermoplastic polymers in a general sense.</p><p>Experimental studies based on in situ bulk volume variations upon tensile loading have been published regarding the quantitative assessment of strain-induced cavitation [32e39], but there is still a great need of understanding of its mechanism of occurrence during plastic deformation. In this aim small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) proved to be a powerful tool owing to the very large electron density contrast between matter and voids [6e10,12e19,23e25].</p><p>Though being not able to detect cavities larger than a few hundred nanometers that generate scattering at very low scattering angles, SAXS enables capturing the very first events of cavitation.</p><p>Generally, cavities are assumed to be generated in the amorphous phase of semi-crystalline polymers. However, it is not clear whether cavitation initiates before or after yielding during tensile drawing. In their pioneer study dealing with high density polyethylene (PE), <ref type="bibr">Butler et al. [6e9]</ref> observed that cavitation occurs at the yield point and concluded that it initiates after the onset of crystal shear. These authors suggested that crystal shear can favor cavity generation. In contrast, Pawlak and Galeski <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> claimed that cavitation can be initiated before the yield point. By comparing tensile and compressive experiments on high density PE, and polypropylene as well, the latter authors suggested that cavitation is liable to promote elementary crystal shear events.</p><p>Notwithstanding, the occurrence of cavitation under tensile drawing has been reported to strongly depend on material characteristics such as molecular weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, thermal history <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and lamella orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, as well as experimental factors such as draw temperature and strain rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Cavitation can eventually disappear for low crystallinity materials or for draw temperatures close to the melting point <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</p><p>In a recent paper, Humbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> reported and exhaustive in situ SAXS study of the tensile drawing of several PE materials having different molecular architectures. The materials were submitted to various crystallization treatments in order to modify the crystalline microstructure, namely the average crystal thickness and the chain topology. Chain topology enfolds interphase, tie chains and chain entanglements that directly transmit the load between crystal and amorphous phase. These mechanically active molecular items are gathered under the generic labeling of stress transmitter (ST). It was shown that the modifications of the materials morphogenesis greatly influenced the occurrence of cavitation. The SAXS patterns have been analyzed in the q-range relevant to the very first events of cavitation, namely its initiation. A semiquantitative physical approach has been developed for describing the cavitation/crystal-shear competition.</p><p>The aim of the present work was to get deeper insight on the influence of temperature on the occurrence of cavitation in semicrystalline polymers and the shearing/cavitation competition upon tensile drawing, and the incidence of the crystal thickness as well. In situ SAXS experiments were performed at various draw temperatures on the same polyethylene samples as the ones of the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in order to extend our data library. A second major objective of the study was to develop a physical model of cavitation that could account for both microstructure and temperature. Our purpose was to base the modeling on an extension of the classical theory of nucleation.</p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> discloses some characteristics of the four materials. The crystallization onset, T onset c , was determined by cooling from the quiescent melt at 170 C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Sample preparation</head><p>The polymer pellets were compression-molded into 500 mm thick sheets at 170 C and quenched into water at room temperature (RT). The cooling rate was about 30 C/s. These samples were labeled "quenched". Two thermal treatments were performed in order to generate two additional crystalline microstructures for every one of the four polymers. The samples hereafter designated as "annealed" were prepared by heat-treatment of quenched sheets for 15 h in a thermostatic oil bath at a temperature close to the crystallization onset T onset c (see Temperature of Heat Treatment (T ht ) in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The samples called "isotherm" were re-melted at 170 C and plunged for 15 h into the same thermostatic oil bath at T ht . During the two thermal treatments, the samples were kept into aluminum plates tightly jointed with a silicone rubber gasket to prevent oil contamination from the thermostatic bath.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">DSC analysis</head><p>The thermal behavior of the polymers has been analyzed with a DSC7 apparatus from PerkineElmer at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The temperature and heat flow scale were calibrated using high purity Indium at the same heating rate. The weight fraction crystallinity, X c , was computed using the melting enthalpy of perfectly crystalline polyethylene DH f ¼ 290 J/g <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The crystallization onset, T onset c , was determined according the procedure described in the PerkineElmer manual at a cooling rate of 10 C/min.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">SAXS characterization</head><p>Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments were carried out on the BM02 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The 2D-patterns were recorded using a CCD camera from Roper Scientific located at a distance of about 140 cm from the sample. The measurement were performed using a wavelength of 0.154 nm giving access to the range of scattering vector 0.05 &lt; q &lt; 0.95 nm À1 that was calibrated by means of silver behenate. The data corrections including dark current, flat field response and tapper distortions were carried out using the software available on the beamline <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>. Background scattering was recorded during the same time as for experiments without sample, for every new experimental condition. Subtraction was not necessary as the background was insignificant compared with the sample scattering.</p><p>In-situ SAXS measurements were performed during tensile tests using a homemade stretching stage equipped with a 5 kN load cell and a heating chamber. The dumbbell samples having 6.5 mm in gauge length and 4 mm in width were stretched at an initial strain rate of 6.4 Â 10 À4 s À1 . The symmetric displacement of the two clamps allowed probing the same zone of the sample during the tests. In addition we have checked that the necking zone size is of the order of magnitude of the gauge length so that the nominal strain is a reasonably good indicator of the local strain of the probed zone even after necking. The pattern recording time of 5 s was chosen in order to have the best compromise between pattern resolution and minimum strain increment during the recording. The stress-strain curves were used to determine the elastic modulus of every sample using two independent recordings at each temperature. The modulus was computed from the tangent at the origin of a 2nd order polynomial fitting on the 0e3% strain range of the experimental curves. The long period, L p , of the lamella periodic stacking was calculated from the correlation maximum of the Lorentz-corrected intensity profile, I(q)q [2], using the Bragg's relation L p ¼ 2p=q peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> where q peak corresponds to the apex of the correlation peak. The crystalline lamella thickness was deduced from the following relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L c ¼ L p r r c X c (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where r c ¼ 1.003 g cm À3 is the density of the PE crystal and r is the density of the sample. This relation assumes very large extend of the crystalline lamellae with regard to thickness, as evidenced by direct AFM observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. The L p and L c data are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The volume fraction of voids was estimated using the method already described by Humbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> after azimuthal integration of the 2D-patterns and correction for sample thickness. The scattering intensity from voids in isotropic systems can be calculated with the following relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">2p 2 ðDrÞ 2 Vð1 À VÞz2p 2 r 2 VK 1 ¼ Z N 0 IðqÞq 2 dq (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where V is the volume fraction of cavities. For anisotropic systems with axial symmetry, the scattering intensity should be integrated according to the following relation as given in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> 2p 2 r 2 VK 1 ¼</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Z N 0 q Z p=2 0 q cosðxÞIðqÞdqdx (<label>4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">)</formula><p>where x is the azimuthal angle. The experimental K 1 factor is a kind of calibration parameter that was determined from the scattering of the semi-crystalline material in the undeformed state according to a previously described procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This factor should be nearly constant during drawing before the occurrence of cavitation since sample thickness changes very little as well as crystallinity. Beyond the strain onset of cavitation, K 1 should change due to modifications of thickness and transmission coefficient of the sample. However, such modifications were not taken into consideration in the present work since our goal was not to assess an absolute value of the scattering intensity but to detect and record the strain onset of cavitation for further modeling.</p><p>The procedure for computing the cavity volume fraction could be only performed in a limited q-window from q min z 0.05 nm À1 as determined by the beamstop to q max z 0.20 nm À1 corresponding to the onset of scattering by the crystalline lamella stacks. Hence, the size of the voids captured by SAXS lies in the range 30e100 nm. This means that only a small part of the voids can by analyzed by this method, the ones bigger than 100 nm being excluded from the analysis. Integration of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">4</ref>) in the range 0 &lt; q &lt; q min was made via a linear extrapolation ignoring the un-accessible bigger cavities. In the range q max &lt; q &lt; N, integration was made by assuming Porod's behavior.</p><p>As pointed out by Humbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, the smallest observable cavities are about 40 nm according to the form factor of the scattering cavities at the onset of appearance of the strong scattering from cavitation. It was thus concluded that the incipient voids quickly expand to a stable size of 40 nm, the recording device being unable to capture the very moment of nucleation. The aim of the procedure is thereby not to assess the whole amount of cavities but to follow up the cavitation nucleation by an in situ determination of the volume fraction of the voids during their growth in the size window 40e100 nm. This procedure stands for the counting of cavity nucleation events. SAXS patterns have been routinely recorded during drawing for all samples at the various draw temperatures. Only the patterns for the PE-C annealed sample are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> as an example. SAXS patterns at RT can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Tensile behavior and SAXS observations</head><p>At the onset of cavitation, the scattering intensity arising from the voids is not isotropic, the central spot being significantly elongated in the tensile direction. Considering the cylindrical symmetry of the system about the draw axis, this means that the cavities have a shape of oblate ellipsoids with their major axis oriented normal to the tensile direction. With increasing strain, the cavity scattering gradually evolves into an elliptic shape transverse to the tensile direction indicating that the cavity shape changes into prolate ellipsoids elongated in the tensile direction.</p><p>Regarding the effect of draw temperature, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that the cavitation scattering from PE-C annealed is delayed at higher strains when T d increases. This reduced trend for cavitation with increasing temperature is true for all the PE samples of the present study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Determination of nucleation and growth of voids</head><p>Quantitative analysis of the 2D-patterns in the q-range of cavity scattering has been performed for all four samples and for the three thermal treatments. In the 2D-patterns of undeformed samples, a very slight scattering can be observed around the beamstop (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This scattering can be due to various kinds of unidentified structural defects that have no influence on our analysis of the data.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> reports several sets of data of void volume fraction computed according to the previously described method. The extremely low V values give evidence that the procedure only concerns a very low fraction of the voids as indicated in the experimental part, namely the voids which size is in the range 40e 100 nm. Besides, it is to be mentioned that the SAXS recordings of strongly cavitating samples should be stopped at rather small strains due to detector saturation. This is an experimental evidence of SAXS tremendous sensitivity to small cavities.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> are plotted the data regarding the drawing at T d ¼ 50 C of the four PE samples submitted to the various thermal treatment. At small strain the volume fraction, V, stays constant to the initial level. This means that no strain-induced cavitation is generated in the pre-yield strain domain. For strains ε &gt; 5%, void volume fraction slowly starts to increase in parallel with deformation for samples PE-D and PE-C isotherm and annealed. Then V jumps at ε z 10% for these four samples indicating a sudden and profuse occurrence of void nucleation events. In contrast, PE-B and PE-A display very little is any cavitation at T d ¼ 50 C. Obviously, at a given draw temperature, the cavitation propensity is directly  connected with structural factors such as crystallinity or crystal thickness (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Besides, the transition from the early cavitating materials to the ones exhibiting delayed cavitation is rather clear cut. This suggests that the occurrence of cavitation is ruled out by a physical criterion with regard to plastic yielding.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>, the data regarding the drawing of PE-D annealed at various draw temperatures show that cavitation nucleation occurs suddenly at strain ε z 10% and jumps quickly with increasing strain for T d 75 C. For T d ¼ 100 C, no more cavitation occurs before the strain reaches ε z 45% which is far beyond the yield point. These latter data show that the criterion of occurrence of cavitation is highly sensitive to temperature.</p><p>The strain onset of cavitation, ε onset , can be estimated from the sudden increase of void volume fraction versus strain curves as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>. Sample which do not display an increase of void volume fraction are considered as been not cavitating though some of them may display an anisotropic central scattering (see for example SAXS pattern in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T d ¼ 100 C ε ¼ 0.42)</formula><p>. It should also be mentioned that ε onset is accurately determined when cavitation occurs prior to yielding since at this stage the deformation is homogeneous so that the nominal strain is relevant. However, when located beyond the yield point, ε onset is just a strain indicator since the occurrence of necking makes the deformation highly heterogeneous so that the nominal strain is irrelevant. This is not a major problem since in the following we will focus on the case of homogeneous cavitation, i.e. when an actual competition exists between cavitation and crystal shear. Indeed, in the heterogeneous case, cavitation does not actually compete with crystal shear, it is just a companion process of the fibrillar transformation.</p><p>Under these considerations, ε onset has been plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> as a function of the crystal thickness, L c , that is a convenient parameter to account for the dependence of microstructure on both the polymer nature and thermal treatment. In the range of the high ε onset values of every plot, the symbols with the label N stands for samples that did not exhibit cavitation within the strain range of our experiments, i.e. ε 1.0. All the curves exhibit the same shape regardless of temperature. The general trend is a steep increase of ε onset with decreasing L c at a given T d . This transition from low to high ε onset values is relevant to a change in the occurrence of cavitation prior to or beyond yielding. The temperature sensitivity of the phenomenon is clearly evidenced by the significant shift to lower L c with decreasing T d . This is a clear indication that the cavitation ability is enhanced by lowering T d at a given L c .</p><p>From every curve of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, a minimum value of the crystal thickness, L min c , can be determined as the one below which cavitation does not occur at a given draw temperature. The vertical broken lines are featuring the asymptotic behavior of the ε onset upswing with decreasing L c at every draw temperature. The positioning of these lines was determined by averaging the experimental L c value associated with ε N onset (no cavitation) and the nearest L c value resulting in a measurable ε onset . For T d ¼ 75 C, the uncertainty is quite high due to the missing of data in the very region under consideration. Extrapolations of the broken lines to the X-axis give the L min c value for every draw temperature of the study. The steady increase of L min c with increasing T d can be attributed to the different thermal activations of crystal shear and cavitation. This is believed to be the origin of the competition between the two process as already pointed out by Humbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and Pawlak-Galeski <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Both groups proposed physical criteria for cavitation based on the balance between the tensile stress required for the nucleation of a cavity and that for initiating crystal shear. This point will be analyzed in more details in the modeling subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Homogeneous versus localized nucleation of cavitation</head><p>For samples having L c &gt; L min c , cavitation can take place either prior or after yielding, so that the phenomenon proceeds homogeneously over the whole sample or locally in the necked region, respectively. The strain onset of cavitation is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> as a function yield strain for all materials that did exhibit cavitation. The straight line ε onset ¼ ε yield shows the separation between the domains relevant to homogeneous and localized cavitation. With increasing draw temperature, the number of samples exhibiting cavitation gradually decreases, and among the cavitating samples fewer and fewer exhibit homogeneous cavitation prior to yielding. At T d ¼ 100 C, none of the less crystalline samples PE-A and PE-B exhibit cavitation, whatever the thermal treatment.</p><p>When cavities occur first in the intercrystalline amorphous phase, the process is homogeneous over the whole sample. In this case, the crystalline microstructure is still under elastic deformation conditions just after cavity nucleation. The scenario of localized cavitation takes places when crystal shear occurs prior to cavitation, the latter process being generated in the yielding regime as a result of crystal breakage. Cavitation is called localized in this case since it is located in the necked region of the sample. A third situation may take place when stress for plastic yielding is much lower than that for cavitation so that cavitation does not occur, or at least is not reached before the strain-hardening domain after complete transformation of the microstructure.

The present data show that this also applies at RT for PE-A quenched or annealed (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The evolution of the cavitation modes of the various materials as a function of the draw temperature is summarized in the sketch of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. The ranking of the samples in the order of increasing L c on the x-axis clearly emphasizes the prime role of this parameter on the ability for cavitation. A thoroughly opposite behavior of the materials can be observed on both sides of the diagram. On the left-hand side, cavitation never occurs at any draw temperature for quenched PE-A and PE-B, and annealed PE-A as well. In contrast, isothermally crystallized and annealed samples of both PE-C and PE-D always exhibit cavitation, either homogeneous or localized depending on T d . In the mid range of the diagram, dual cavitation behavior is observed for the four polymers depending on their thermal treatment and T d , i.e. either localized cavitation or no cavitation. The annealed PE-C specimen is the only one to experience all three modes from homogeneous cavitation to no cavitation with increasing T d from 25 to 100 C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Modeling of the cavitation/crystal-shear competition</head><p>A physical approach of cavitation in semi-crystalline polymers is developed to quantitatively account for the experimental observations under uniaxial tensile drawing at various temperatures. The modeling of cavitation is based on the classical nucleation theory previously introduced by Humbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The main progress consists in building up a scaling transition from the local to the macroscopic scale and taking into account the temperature effects. This approach only considers the case of homogeneous cavitation and assumes linear elasticity at every step of the modeling.</p><p>The starting point is the mechanism by which cavitation is generated and the assumption regarding the computation of the cavitation stress at a local scale in the bulk. Borrowing from Mourglia [45], a classical nucleation theory involving both surface and volume energy contributions can be used. The above author supposed that the energy relaxed when a cavity is generated includes a surface energy contribution associated with the new surface generated by the cavity and a local elastic energy contribution that can be written in the form Kε 2 v dV, where K is the bulk modulus and ε v the volume strain. This model was conceived for solid material such as glassy polymers but less relevant for liquids or rubbers. The glass transition temperature of polyethylene is far below room temperature so that the amorphous phase confined between two neighbor crystallites is rubbery for the testing conditions of the present study. As a consequence the elastic stress about an incipient cavity can relax over the whole volume of the rubber phase, so that the relaxed elastic energy should have the form Kε v dV. The potential energy, 4, representative of the material state can be then expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">4 ¼ À 4 3 pr 3 Kε v þ 4pr 2 g (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>where g is the surface tension of the material, and r is the radius of the cavity. The definition of such a potential allows determining a critical radius, r c , for a stable cavitation nucleus from the derivate (d4/dr) r ¼ rc ¼ 0, and a potential barrier D4 for reaching the critical value 4 (r c ). Therefore, it comes straightforwardly that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D4 ¼ 16pg 3 3 À Kε cav v Á 2 ¼ 16pg 3 3s cav 2 v (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where s cav v and ε cav v are the critical values of the volume stress (i.e. hydrostatic stress) and the volume strain for the generation of a cavity.</p><p>In the theory of thermal activation processes, the nucleation potential barrier is assumed to obey the classical temperaturedependent relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Df ¼ dk b T (7)</formula><p>where k b is the Boltzmann constant. The d factor only accessible from experiments is strongly dependent on experimental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>. In the present study d should be a constant since experimental conditions are unchanged for all materials except temperature that is specifically taken into account in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">7</ref>).

A schematic of the approach is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> that displays an intermediate step at the nanoscale of lamella stacks. This approach involves both physical considerations and experimental findings. Only the equatorial regions of the spherulites are taken into account since cavitation should preferentially initiate in the rubbery amorphous phase confined between the crystal lamellae normal to the tensile stress due to the favorable situation with negative hydrostatic stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>.</p><p>It is first assumed at a microscopic scale that the volume strain in the amorphous layer of the semi-crystalline polymer, ε v , is proportional to the axial strain, ε a z , so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">ε v ¼ Bε a z (<label>9</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">)</formula><p>where B is a coefficient mainly dependent on the material morphology. Indeed, this coefficient is physically related to the local stress state of the amorphous phase confined between the crystallites in the stacks: B ¼ 1 for purely oedometric state of stress that stands for highly crystalline polymers with very high lamella shape factor, f ¼ width/thickness; B ¼ 0 for isochoric biaxial state in the case of low crystallinity polymers with narrow lamella stacks and thick amorphous layers. AFM observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> performed on the materials of the present study revealed that the lamella shape factor spans the range 20 &lt; f &lt; 100 depending on the crystallinity.</p><p>Besides, it was shown on theoretical grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref> that in a stack of alternating soft and stiff layers under tensile testing the volume stress does not change significantly in the f range mentioned above. This means that the state of stress and strain in the soft layers is roughly insensitive to f changes in the range 20 &lt; f &lt; 100. Therefore, one may reasonably assume that the B factor of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>) is fairly constant for the present materials. Moreover, considering that B is essentially structure-dependent, one should expect very little sensitivity to temperature, if any.</p><p>In parallel to Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>) one may also assume a linear elastic behavior at the microscopic scale of the confined amorphous layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> where s v is the volume stress and K the bulk modulus of the amorphous phase.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">s v ¼ Kε v</formula><p>A step ahead in the scaling transition can be made by considering that the crystalline layer in the lamella stacks is much stiffer than the amorphous layer, so that the microscopic strain in the amorphous layers, ε a z , can be related to the mesoscopic strain of the stack by</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ε meso ¼ ε a z L a =L p (<label>11</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">)</formula><p>where the mesoscopic strain, ε meso , comes from SAXS measurements, and L p ¼ L a þ L c is the long period, L c and L a being the thicknesses of the crystalline lamellae and the amorphous layers respectively. The next step in the scaling transition is then to establish a relationships between the mesoscopic scale of the lamella stacks and the macroscopic scale, for both stress and strain. Experimental data from a previous SAXS study <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref> showed that the mesoscopic to macroscopic strain ratio at room temperature is nearly crystallinity independent in the range 50% &lt; X c &lt; 80%, for the same materials as those of the present study. Besides, from the present SAXS data it turned out that this coefficient remains roughly crystallinity independent at each temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>. These experimental findings afford a base for the meso-macro scaling transition which can be written as CðTÞ ¼ ε meso =ε macro <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> where ε macro is the macroscopic strain during a tensile test.

It is a function of both temperature and microstructure. However, based on the quantitative data of the various parameters of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">17</ref>) reported in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, the dependence of s cav macro on crystallinity is expected to be rather weak in contrast to that of s cav v . Indeed, C, K and B are roughly independent of microstructure (X c or L c ), whereas E is an increasing function of X c (or L c ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref> but this dependence should be counterbalanced by the factor (1Àf c ). Experimental determination of s cav macro can be performed from the nominal stress/strain curves at the strain onset of cavitation, ε onset , as determined from SAXS. Here, ε onset is considered to be equivalent to ε cav macro (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Only the cases of homogeneous cavitation have been taken into consideration. Indeed, the localized cavitation is associated with the occurrence of plastic necking prior  to cavitation that does not enable an accurate determination of ε onset . The s cav macro data in the pre-yield strain domain are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref> as a function of L c for various values of the draw temperature.</p><p>s cav macro appears to be very little sensitive to L c at every T d whereas it strongly decreases with increasing T d .</p><p>A thorough characterization of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">17</ref>) requires to identify the (d 0.5 B) À1 term by fitting the data of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>, since both d and B are unknown. The values of the parameters C and g are taken from literature [48e51], whereas K is obtained by extrapolation of data from literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref>. The E and f c data directly come from the present experiments. The fittings of the experimental data at the various temperatures give a fairly constant value (d 0.5 B) À1 ¼ 0.42 AE 0.04. This result is quite remarkable since it validates our assumptions that both d and B are roughly constant. Indeed, if the constant value of B was justified on scientific grounds it was not the case for d. Moreover, (d 0.5 B) À1 is the only adjustable parameter of the present cavitation model. Its constant value irrespective of temperature and crystal thickness reveals an excellent robustness of the model. It is to be noticed that the strong temperature dependence of the s cav macro experimental data does not appear strikingly from Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">17</ref>). The observed T d independence of the (d 0.5 B) À1 term as well as the rather low T d sensitivity of g and K <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">52]</ref> suggest that the experimental temperature dependence of s cav macro mainly lies in the C and E parameters. As a matter of fact, in the temperature range 25e100 C, C increases from 0.5 to 0.8 whereas E drops by a factor of about 2e3 for any sample (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). These two factors can mainly account for the s cav macro drop with increasing T d (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). Regarding the modeling of the crystalline shear process, the present work borrows from the physically supported dislocation approach proposed by Young <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53]</ref> which is the most consensual one so far. Indeed, several authors have checked the robustness this approach as a function of experimental parameters such as temperature and strain rate as well as structural parameters such as crystallinity and/or crystal thickness (see Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[54]</ref> and refs cited therein). In this approach the critical tensile stress, s crit , for initiation of crystal shear was shown to obey a sigmoidal dependence on L c of the form s crit f expð À AðTÞ=L c À 1Þ <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> However, in the range of crystal thickness 5e30 nm that corresponds to medium and high crystallinity PE materials, Eq. ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) follows a fairly linear relationship versus L c , <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53]</ref>, and experimental data as well at RT. So that Eq. ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>) can be approximated by s crit ¼ aðTÞ L c <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> Moreover, in a previous paper regarding specifically the yielding behavior of the present materials at room temperature, Humbert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> showed that the linear relationship is strongly sensitive to the crystallization method. This dependence was ascribed to the modification of the molecular topology of the amorphous phase which transmits the stress between the crystal lamellae via tie molecules, chain entanglements, rigid amorphous interfacial layer, etc This contribution was empirically taken into account by the relation s yield fs crit ½ST 0:6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> where s yield is the actual tensile stress for yielding and [ST] is the concentration of molecular stress transmitters in the amorphous phase. In parallel, it was experimentally observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> that [ST] N L À0.5 . Thus, it finally results that s yield can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">s yield ¼ aðTÞ L 0:7 c (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where a is a function of the temperature.</p><p>Experimental s yield data have been plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> as a function of L c , for the various values of the draw temperature. These data display first a monotonic increase with increasing L c . The temperature dependence is also fairly monotonic. However, a very clear deviation appears for the higher L c values when s yield levels off. This is particularly noticeable for the lower T d values, i.e. 25 C and 50 C, and for the samples which displayed homogeneous cavitation prior to yielding. Besides, the strain level at which the deviation starts coincides with the ε onset for cavitation. This is an indication that the early occurrence of cavitation, i.e. homogeneous cavitation, biases the onset of the yielding process at a stress value lower than it should be if yielding occurred by crystal shear only. It is to be noticed that this phenomenon of cavitation-promoted yielding has been already discussed by some authors without experimental evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In the present study, the s yield data in the deviation strain domain of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> have been excluded for the fitting of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">21</ref>). This fitting was fairly well achieved by the following function</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">s yield ¼ ðaT þ bÞ L 0:7 c (<label>22</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_29">)</formula><p>where a ¼ À0.036 and b ¼ 14.6, when s yield is given in MPa, L c in nm and T in C.  In the purpose of predicting the cavitation/shear competition, Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">17</ref>) and Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">21</ref>) have been plotted together in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> as a function of L c , for the various draw temperatures investigated in the present study. It clearly appears that s cav is considerably less sensitive to L c than s yield . However, the dependence on temperature is quite similar for the two processes: as a matter of fact, it can be seen that over the whole L c range of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> the value of either s cav or s yield at 75 C is close to half the corresponding value at 25 C.</p><p>It is to be noticed that the present theoretical modeling of cavitation predicts a rather low dependence of s cav macro on L c in contrast to the previous qualitative approach predicting a noticeable drop of the cavitation stress increasing L c . The reason is that the meso-macro scale transition was not taken into account in the previous study.</p><p>The macroscopic stress for cavitation was supposed identical to the stress at the meso scale s a z (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). This stress has been shown to strongly depend on the stress concentration of transmitters, [ST], that decreases with increasing crystal thickness. More details on this s a z dependence on [ST] and L c are given in appendix. However, the meso-macro scale transition introduced in the present work involves a compensation effect leading to a predicted weak dependence of s cav macro on L c .</p><p>Comparing now the evolutions of s cav macro and s yield at every temperature, the major feature of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> is that every couple of curves exhibits a crossing point at a critical L c value, L cc , to which is associated a change in the deformation regime. The occurrence of this crossing point is due to the strong dependence of s yield on L c whereas s cav macro is essentially L c independent. For L c &lt; L cc , s yield is lower than s cav macro so that crystal shear is expected to start before the occurrence of cavitation; for L c &gt; L cc , s yield is higher than s cav macro so that cavitation is expected to start before the occurrence of crystal shear followed by yielding. It is to be noticed that Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> only applies for homogenous cavitation, it does not predict the occurrence of heterogeneous cavitation.</p><p>The L cc data predicted from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref> as a function of the draw temperature, only for the material which displayed homogeneous cavitation, i.e. the annealed and isotherm samples of polymers PE-C and PE-D. The steady increase of L cc with temperature is an indication that the occurrence of crystal shear prior to cavitation in the case of thick crystalline lamellae requires an increase of the draw temperature. For the sake of comparison, experimentally determined values of L cc are also plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>. These experimental L cc values were computed at every T d from the average of the higher L c value for which crystal shear initiates first and the lower L c value for which cavitation occurs first. For example, at T d ¼ 25 C, crystal shear is activated first for L c 16 nm whereas cavitation occurs first for L c ! 21 nm: then L cc ¼ 19 AE 3 nm.</p><p>Because none of the present samples exhibit initiation of cavitation before crystalline shear at 100 C, it can be concluded that at this temperature L cc is above the higher L c value of the present study, i.e. 29 nm for PE-D isotherm. This perfectly agrees with the predicted value L cc ¼ 32 nm at T d ¼ 100 C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>The aim of the present study was to address the phenomenon of cavitation in semi-crystalline polymers on both experimental and theoretical standpoints. Either homogeneous or localized cavitation has been observed before or after yielding. A comparison between the strain onset of cavitation and the yield strain clearly showed the competition between the two phenomena. The crystal thickness proved to be a major structural factor of the competition together with the temperature. Moreover, it was clearly shown that the occurrence of homogeneous cavitation prior to yielding promotes the occurrence of crystal shear as evidenced by the yield stress depression.</p><p>In the temperature range 25e100 C, homogeneous cavitation prior to yielding was observed only for samples having L c &gt; 20 nm. Localized cavitation after yielding occurred for samples having L c &gt; 12 nm, depending on the draw temperature, T d . In contrast, no cavitation was observed for samples having L c &lt; 12 nm, the plastic deformation being fairly homogeneous. For samples of this kind, homogenous cavitation would eventually occur below RT. The main influence of an increase of T d was to either promote localized cavitation after yielding for samples that displayed homogeneous cavitation at RT, or to inhibit cavitation in the case of localized cavitation at RT.</p><p>Regarding the modeling of strain-induced cavitation, a thermally activated nucleation of voids in the amorphous layers of the lamella stacks has been developed for the equatorial regions of the spherulites where the local stress is normal to the lamella surface. A 2-step scaling transition from the micro-to the macro-scale can be easily achieved via the meso-scale of the stacks. It is worth noticing that this modeling involves only one adjustable parameter (d 0.5 B) À1 where the microstructural parameter B is hardly accessible to experiments and d is generally used to account for complex phenomena not taken into account in the classical nucleation theory.</p><p>The very low sensitivity of s cav macro to crystal thickness and its strong dependence on T d are fairly well predicted.  Two remarks have to be made regarding the shortcomings of the cavitation modeling and the limits of the approach for predicting the cavitation/yielding competition. First, the cavitation nucleation model only applies to semi-crystalline polymers having a high shape factor of the crystalline lamellae, i.e. relatively high crystallinity polymers (X c ! 50%). Indeed, for low crystallinity materials the B coefficient could not be considered as independent of the shape factor (see comment of Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">9</ref>)). For this reason the domain L c &lt; 10 nm that corresponds to low crystallinity materials should be excluded from the modeling, though the prediction of no cavitation in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref> does reflect the actual observations. Second, the present modeling of the yielding process does not apply to very thick crystals (i.e. L c ! 40 nm) for which it turns out that the yield stress levels off <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[55]</ref>. Fortunately, a good deal of polyethylene materials fall in the domain 10 nm &lt; L c &lt; 40 nm.</p><p>In parallel to the cavitation modeling, a semi-empirical approach has been proposed to describe for the dependency on temperature and crystal thickness of the yield stress, borrowing from previous theoretical and experimental studies.</p><p>The comparison of the predicted s cav macro and s yield curves allows determining the L c domains where either of the two processes occurs first. For every T d value, a shear/cavitation transition clearly appears for a critical value of the crystal thickness, L cc . The main influence of increasing T d was to shift L cc to higher values. This was not intuitively predictable since the two challenging processes display similar T d dependence at first sight (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>). The fact is that the T d dependence of s yield is slightly stronger than that of s cav macro which is not totally explicit in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_25">17</ref>) due to the temperature dependence of several material parameters. Therefore, owing to its greater temperature sensitivity yielding becomes predominant over cavitation with increasing T d : it results that samples having increasingly thick crystals may yield without cavitation at high T d . The predicted L cc values thus determined from the crossing of the modeled curves are remarkably close to the ones experimentally observed, at every draw temperature.</p><p>To finish with, it must be pointed out that our modeling approach should a priori apply to most kinds of semi-crystalline polymers provided that the crystal shear stress obeys a growing monotonic relationship with L c , in agreement with Young's dislocation-governed model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 shows the nominal stressestrain curves of PE-C annealed as a function of the draw temperature, T d .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix. Role of [ST] on s cav</head><p>Equation (A) is related to the stress state in the lamellar stack (see Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> in the text). It is supposed to be dependent on the geometry of the stack. For a very high shape factor (f ¼ length/thickness) the behavior is nearly oedometric: the lateral contraction when stretching normal to the lamella surface is negligible. In this case B ¼ 1. When the shape factor is very low, i.e. f z 1, stretching normal to the lamella surface can be assimilated to a simple tensile test: then B ¼ 0, i.e. isovolumic deformation for a rubber.</p><p>It is now possible to rewrite this equation by introducing the stress, assuming linear elastic behavior,</p><p>where M is the apparent modulus of the confined amorphous phase. By combining Eqs. AeC, a stress relation can be obtained:</p><p>The micro-macro relationship between the macroscopic stress and the axial stress in the stack into the following form can then be rewritten:</p><p>Regarding the dependence of s a z with L c , one can notice that C and E(1Àf c ) are roughly independent of L c . As a consequence, considering only the L c variation, it turns out that</p><p>As s macro is only weakly dependent with L c , there are two possibilities. Either both s a z and M are independent of L c or they evolve in opposite sense. However there are strong clues <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[56]</ref> that ST reinforce the amorphous phase a then that M is a growing function of the concentration of stress transmitters    s cav v : volume stress or hydrostatic stress for the nucleation of a cavity. ε a z : mesoscopic axial strain in the amorphous phase in the lamella stacks.</p><p>s a z : mesoscopic axial stress in the amorphous phase (s a z refers to s cav from ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref> B: proportionality coefficient between ε v and ε a z . f: shape factor length/width of the crystalline lamellae. ε v : mesoscopic volume strain in the amorphous phase in the lamella stacks.</p><p>s v : volume stress in the amorphous phase in the lamella stacks. ε meso : axial strain at the mesoscale of the lamella stack as measured by SAXS. ε macro : macroscopic axial strain. C: proportionality coefficient between ε meso and ε macro . E: Young modulus of the bulk material.</p><p>s macro : macroscopic tensile stress s ocav macr : macroscopic tensile stress for initiation of cavitation. ε yield : strain at yield point.</p><p>s crit : critical tensile stress for initiation of crystal shear from Young's dislocation model.</p><p>s yield : actual tensile stress for yielding.</p><p>[ST]: concentration of molecular stress transmitters between crystalline lamellae. L min c : minimum value of crystal thickness for which cavitation can occur at given T d .</p><p>L cc : critical crystal thickness at the crystal shear / cavitation transition. M: apparent elastic modulus of the amorphous phase.</p></div>			</div>
