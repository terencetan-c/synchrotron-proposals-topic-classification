See below for abstract and datacollection statistics.</p><p>-dNT-2 with thymidine and Berylliumtrifluoride: <ref type="bibr">Rinaldo-Matthis, A., C. Rampazzo, et al. (2002)</ref>. "Crystal structure of a human mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotidase." Nat Struct Biol 9(10): 779-87. 5'-nucleotidases are ubiquitous enzymes that dephosphorylate nucleoside monophosphates and participate in the regulation of nucleotide pools. The mitochondrial 5'-(3') deoxyribonucleotidase (dNT-2) specifically dephosphorylates dUMP and dTMP, protecting mitochondrial DNA replication from excess dTTP. We have solved the structure of dNT-2, the first determined structure of a mammalian 5'-nucleotidase. The structure reveals a relationship to the HAD family, with a phosphoserine phosphatase as the closest neighbor. A structure-based sequence alignment of dNT-2 with other 5'-nucleotidases also suggests a common origin for these enzymes. The structure of dNT-2 has been studied in complex with bound phosphate and beryllium trifluoride plus thymidine as model for a phosphoenzyme product complex. Based on these structures, determinants for substrate specificity recognition and the catalytic action of dNT-2 are outlined. <ref type="bibr">Rinaldo-Matthis, A., C. Rampazzo, et al. (2002)</ref>.

The tyrosine residue carrying the radical in R2 is conserved among all sequenced R2 proteins with the exception of the Chlamydia family, which instsead of a tyrosine has a phenylalanine at this position (Chlamydia trachomatis F127, E.coli Y122). As a part of the phasing project of the class II ribonucleotide reductase from Thermotoga maritima, a 100 % complete SAD dataset to around 2.9Å was collected at the LIII edge of Iridum. However, the dataset did not contribute to the phasing effort as the occupancy of the IrCl 2 appeared to be very low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report</head></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>: Class II Ribonucleotide reductase phasing project Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are essential for all life by virtue of catalysing the only dedicated step of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. They all use radical chemistry and all are allosterically regulated [1]. RNRs can be divided into three classes based on their mechanism of radical generation [2]. Class I RNRs are oxygen-dependent and generate a stable tyrosyl radical by activation of molecular oxygen at the di-iron centre of an activating protein. Class III RNRs are strictly anaerobic and generate a stable glycyl radical by homolytic cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine at a [4Fe-4S] centre, again in a separate activating protein unrelated to that of class I. Class II RNRs generate a transient 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical by homolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond in adenosylcobalamin (adocob), which is bound directly to the reductase.</figDesc></figure>
