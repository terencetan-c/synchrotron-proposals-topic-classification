<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As said in the proposal, we used a 5cm 2 PEMFC PEEK cell, specially built to perform in operando X-ray diffraciton studies. The cell was operated at 75°C and gas flow rates were set in order to have a fixed stoichiometry ratio 1.2 for hydrogen and 2 for air. The absloute gas pressure was set to 1.2 bar and the relative humidity was set to 40% at the cathode and 100% at the anode. Prior to the beginning of the measurements the membrane was completely dehydrated by flowing Ar at both, cathodic and anodic gas inlets for several hours. We performed XRD-CT measurementsduring the operation od PEMFC, obtaining spatial and time-resolved information regarding the distribition and structural evolution of the catalyst layer, as well as water distrubution in the membrane.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>XRD-CT datasets have been integrated (without using any filters). The initial preprocessing step included centering of the sinograms and background subtraction. All datasets have been reconstructed. These datasets were then aligned as the starting position was not the same in all XRD-CT scans (due to the zig-zag data collection strategy). In total, four different z positions (i.e. P1 = 9.92, P2 = 10.2, P3 = 10.25, P4 = 10.3) along the PEMFC were probed under different operating conditions. A summary of the operando XRD-CT experiment with the PEMFC is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The first z position (P1) corresponds to the PEMFC flow channels. The sample was then moved in z by 300 µm in order to probe the catalyst layer (P2). XRD-CT scans were also collected at two more z positions (i.e. P3 and P4). Positions P2, P3 and P4 were 50 µm apart from each other. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, XRD-CT scans at these four positions were collected under different operating conditions (i.e. no operation, 1 V and 0.6 V). The first XRD-CT scan was performed at a z position probing the PEMFC flow channels (P1). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, there are four main components present. Each image in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> has been normalized with respect to the maximum intensity. Also shown, at the right side of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, is the combined image which serves to illustrate that we can obtain a high quality XRD-CT image of the PEMFC. The diffraction patterns generated by these four components are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (left). These are the summed diffraction patterns from the voxels corresponding to the four regions presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Each of these diffraction patterns was also normalised with respect to the maximum intensity.</p><p>The diffraction pattern from the outer component corresponds to a PEEK diffraction pattern. The diffraction pattern from component 2 (second from the left in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is a lot more complex. On the other hand, the diffraction pattern from component 3 (third from the left in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) seems to generate a diffraction pattern identical to the first one (i.e. PEEK). Finally, the material consisting the flow channels generates a characteristic strong diffraction peak at ca. Q = 1.88 Å -1 . The main advantage of XRD-CT lies on the fact that the diffraction/scattering signal from each voxel in the reconstructed data volume corresponds to signal generated by this sample volume. For example, in the case of the PEMFC, we are able to apply a mask in a region of interest where the catalyst is present (middle of the sample) and extract the summed diffraction pattern from only this area. These diffraction patterns are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (right) where the only phase present is metallic Pt.</p><p>Closer inspection of these diffraction patterns reveals that there is a difference in the position of the Pt diffraction peaks in the various datasets. This shift of the diffraction peaks implies a significant difference in the size of the Pt unit cell. However, as it is clearly shown in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>, this shift of the peaks seems to primarily depend on the z position and not on the operating conditions (which is rather intriguing).</p><p>The global XRD-CT images from the low resolution XRD-CT scans are presented in Figure. The results obtained in this experiment were reported in a conference:</p><p>1) In-Situ Electrochemical X-Ray Diffraction of Pt Oxidation and Reduction in Hydrogen Fuel Cells. 233 rd ECS Meeting (May 13-17, 2018) (Fuel Cells, Electrolyzers, and Energy Conversion).</p><p>2) Full Characterization of an Operating Fuel Cell Using High Energy X-Rays. 233 rd ECS Meeting (May 13-17, 2018) (Fuel Cells, Electrolyzers, and Energy Conversion).</p><p>A publication is in preparation which will include results of this experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The four main components present in the XRD-CT dataset 'tomo_1_Biologic'.
