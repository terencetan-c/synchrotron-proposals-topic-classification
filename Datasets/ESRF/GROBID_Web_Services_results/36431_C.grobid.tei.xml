<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Nanocrystalline SnO 2 is the most promising material for the development of resistive gas sensors, which are used for the detection of toxic and explosive gases in the atmosphere (CO, H 2 , NO x etc). SnO 2 is a wide band gap semiconductor of n-type. The conductivity of this material depends on the atmosphere composition. Adsorption of oxygen on the SnO 2 surface creates so-called 'trapped charges'. Chemisorption and subsequent redox reactions of a target gas with the adsorbed oxygen species lead to modulations of the quantity of charge on the surface and a variation of conductivity. Deposition of metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd) on the SnO 2 surface enhances the sensitivity to CO and H 2 and decreases the working temperature. In spite of the wide practical application the role of the nanoparticles is still under discussion.</p><p>In the present work we have studied the gas sensors, which were nanocrystalline SnO 2 films of 1 micron thickness containing 0.6 at% of Pt (sensor A, Pt nanoparticles of 1.5 nm [2]) and 6.3 at% Pt (sensor B, Pt nanoparticles of 2.5 nm [1]), respectively. The idea was to see in which state Pt nanoparticles (size, oxidatation state) improve the sensor properties of SnO 2 thin films towards low concentrations (1000ppm) of CO and H 2 in low temperature regime (25 and 100 o C). To produce Pt nanoparticles having different oxidation states sensors A and B were treated either in oxidizing (ox 20%O 2 in He) or in reducing (red 1000 ppm CO in He) atmospheres at 350 o C then cooled down and purged with He. Then gas sensor properties of A_ox, B_ox, A_red, and B_red were studied at 25 and 100 o C in the same reactor. During all the process we measured the evolution of HERFD XAS spectra at Pt L 3 -edge (with 2 min time resolution) and also catalytic properties (CO 2 production from CO) using mass-spectrometer. Exactly the same measurements were repeated using 1000 ppm H 2 in He as a reducing atmosphere.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows Pt L 3 HERFD XAS spectra in A_ox, B_ox, A_red, and B_red gas sensor films together with the spectra of pure PtO 2 , 1nm-Pt nanoparticles on alumina (reduced in H 2 ), and Pt(II)acac used as the reference samples. One can see that sensor A changes significantly its oxidation state depending on the annealing atmosphere and the sensor B does not. It may be explained by the fact that nanoparticles in the sensor A are smaller and the structure of SnO 2 thin film is more porous [1] compared to the sensor B. This is probably why the nanoparticles in the sensor B stay metallic after annealing in oxidizing atmosphere.</p><p>None of the spectra look like Pt(II)acac. It is also interesting to note that (i) HERFD XAS spectra of Pt in the B_ox and B_red are very similar to that of metallic platinum, (ii) the spectrum A_ox resembles that of PtO 2 , (iii) but the spectrum of A_red is different. The white line of A_red is small like in the reduced state but shifted to higher energies compared to that of metallic Pt. We were considering two possible explanations: (1) absorption of CO on Pt nanoparticles (this structure was discussed in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) formation Pt-Sn alloyed nanoparticles due to reduction of SnO 2 during interaction with reducing atmosphere. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the Pt L 3 HERFD XAS spectrum of A_red plotted together with that of A_red_H 2 (A sensor reduced in 1000 ppm H 2 in He atmosphere at 350 o C) and the reference spectra of 1nm Pt nanoparticles on alumina reduced in H 2 and the same Pt particles covered with chemisorbed CO <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The spectra of A_red and A_red_H 2 resembles the one of 1nm Pt on alumina covered by CO, however, in our case this explanation is impossible since A_red_H 2 cannot have chemisorbed CO on its surface. Therefore the second explanation related to formation of Pt-Sn alloyed nanoparticles is more probable. To confirm it we performed FEFF8 calculations using Pt 6 and PtSn 5 clusters simulating platinum atoms on the surface surrounded by Pt and Sn, respectively <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the experimental spectrum of A_red compared to theoretical ones of Pt 6 and PtSn 5 clusters. One can see that the white line of PtSn 5 cluster is shifted to the higher energies compared to the one of Pt 6 . Therefore we suppose that Pt A_red sensor can be partially surrounded by Sn, partially by Pt, and partially by O atoms</p><p>The most important result is that we have found a very clear correlation between the oxidation state of Pt nanoparticles at the sensor properties of corresponding SnO 2 -based gas sensors. The sensor properties of four sensors towards low concentration of CO at 25 o C are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. One can see that A_ox sensor, which contains mostly oxidized Pt nanoparticles, is the most performing. In the presence of CO the conductivity of sensor A_ox changes reversibly by three orders of magnitude. The sensitivity of the other sensors is much smaller. It should be mentioned that changes Pt L 3 HERFD XAS spectra of A_ox due to the presence of CO at 25 o C are very small, platinum stays oxidized like PtO 2 and not like Pt(II) (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Therefore we can conclude that platinum nanoparticles is the performing SnO 2 gas sensors has to be oxidised, however, Pt(II) species do not need to be present. The experiments with 1000 ppm H 2 have shown very similar results both in conductivity response and changes in Pt L 3 HERFD XAS spectra. It means that the role of Pt nanoparticles in the low temperature (25-100 o C) sensor response towards CO and H 2 is similar and rather 'chemical' than 'electronic <ref type="bibr">' [2]</ref>. The mass-spectrometer data also correlates with proposed mechanism. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the kinetics of CO 2 production during the sensor response process towards 1000 ppm CO in He. A_ox sensor has the highest catalytic activity in CO oxidation reaction with oxygen chemisorbed on SnO 2 surface, which means that oxidised Pt nanoparticles (in oxidised state) are more active than metallic or alloyed, which fully explain their promoting effect on the sensor properties of nanocrystalline SnO 2 . Recent surface diffraction studies on platinum single crystal surfaces have indicated a higher rate of oxidation of carbon monoxide at when the surface is oxidized to PtO 2 <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. There is a clear correlation with our data.</p><p>1. I. <ref type="bibr">Matko et al., Sensors and actuators B, 59( 1999)</ref> 210-215 2. O.V. <ref type="bibr">Safonova et al., J. Phys.
