<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>HC2147, ID06LVP, 07/10-13/10/15 W.A. Crichton (ESRF), J. Guignard (ESRF)</p><p>The purpose of the experiment was to delineate any phase boundaries occurring between the o', rh and cubic structures of In 2 O 3 . There is some considerable debate on this topic, highlighted in recent work of Bekheet and others, which concludes that the rh-In 2 O 3 phase (corundum type) is stable. Unfortunately, this current work suggests otherwise; that o' is stable at high p, T and that rh is recovered only on decompression having transformed to o', except perhaps in one very limited p, T region between cubic and o' phases. Therefore, o' is not metastable but rh may be, although it can be prepared reliably. Having formed o' it will invariably transform to rh at all pressures less than o' except at highest temperatures, where it will transform directly to the stable cubic phase. The region of where rh-In 2 O 3 will form is delineated. Roughly (work in progress):</p><p>This may be due to the relationship shown below, based in in situ data a transformation, which maps the rh and the o' to a common subgroup, from which inferences on the mechanism of transformation can be established:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inspection of the subgroup structure S2, derived from o'-In 2 O 3 , we see that the atom that is required to move most is that involved in the splitting is the 8d positions to 2 x 4g of S1 and S2, which are equivalent, eventually, to the 18e of rh-In 2 O 3 . In moving, this oxygen causes significant polyhedral rotation and bond breaking and brings the eventual corundum sheet to in-plane O 18e positions. In other systems, this mechanism might provide a way by which bixbyite-type structures transform to corundum. The o' is elsewhere known as Rh 2 O 3 -II-type. Each of these are rather widespread. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>In short: 8 runs were made on both In 2 O 3 and In(OH) 3 starting materials. In(OH) 3 transforms to InO(OH) to c-In 2 O 3 to rh-In 2 O 3 with increasing temperature. Therefore (and following known transformations) rh-In 2 O 3 is favourably obtained in from the hydroxide in a system where it is not otherwise obviously stable. The following transformations were observed c → o', o' → c; c → rh+o'(and possible triple point); rh+o' → o'; o' → rh; rh → c; c→ In + O 2 (it effectively evaporates). Transformations were, as much as allows, observed by both changing pressure and changing temperature conditions. A manuscript is currently in prep. Continuous diffraction patterns showing (left) transformation of In(OH) 3 to InO(OH) and, right, to c-In 2 O 3 and rh-In 2 O 3 . The colder data are to the top of each panel. Each per 3.2 sec.</figDesc></figure>
