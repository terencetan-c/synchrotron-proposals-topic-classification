<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Proposal summary:</p><p>Cu-exchanged chabazite zeolites (Cu-CHA) are excellent catalysts for NOx removal from the exhaust gas of diesel vehicles, via the selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 to N2 and H2O (NH3-SCR). However, their low-temperature activity decreases after prolonged exposure to sulphur, ever-present in diesel fuel. In our recent in situ experiment (CH-5960) we proved that SO2 actively reacts only with some particular SCR-relevant Cu intermediates, being virtually unreactive to others. Now, when the Cu species that are the most vulnerable to SO2 are identified, we are prepared to face the challenge of determining the mechanism of Cu reactivity towards SO2 under real SCR conditions. In the proposed experiment we will reveal the mechanisms of sulphur poisoning and regeneration of Cu-CHA by characterising Cu complexes that form in Cu-CHA during interaction with SO2 under operando SCR conditions. This requires operando Cu K-edge XANES and EXAFS measurements for monitoring the electronic structure and local environment of active Cu centres during the adsorption and desorption of sulphur in presence of other components of the SCR mixture. Obtained results will be crucial to optimize regeneration procedures for the catalysts, increasing thus their efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment description</head><p>The idea of the experiment was to expose the Cu-CHA catalyst to the SCR mixture at different temperatures and then add SO2 to the mixture to observe the effect of SO2 on the active Cu species in the real operando conditions. The Cu-CHA catalyst was activated in 10% O2/He at 550 â„ƒ and then exposed to the SCR mixture (500 ppm NO, 600 ppm NH3, 10% O2, 4% H2O). Then the sample was cooled down to one of the three temperatures: 200, 250, 500 o C. 200 and 250 o C correspond to the low-temperature SCR which is the main subject of our studies. We chose also 500 o C to compare the effect of SO2 on the high-temperature SCR. After the state of Cu stabilized at the sertain temperature, we add SO2 to the gas mixture to see the effect of it in the catalyst performance and on the oxidation state and local environment of Cu. The measurements were conducted in flow conditions using a new ESRF operando cell, compatible with the desired temperatures and gas compositions. A mass spectrometer was used to monitor the catalytic activity of the samples and quantity of sulphur uptake and relese. During the experimental protocol X-ray absorption spectra were measuring to track the evolution of the Cu oxidation state and local environment. We measured a sample with Cu content: 3.2 wt% (Cu_CHA_68E).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>We performed operando SO2 poisoning of the catalyst at three different temperatures ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>    Conclusions 1) The experiments provided the first operando characterisation of suplhur species formed during the poisoning of the active Cu sites of Cu-CHA catalysts. 2) We found the Cu species forming during the SO2 poisoning of the catalyst in operando conditions for the lowtemperature SCR. The SO2 for the high-temperature SCR does not have such a high impact on the performance and the Cu species participating in the reaction cycle are different. 3) The results will be further analysed with advanced mixture-resolving techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution (MCR) to provide the full characterization of the SO2 poisoning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Laboratory Universita di Torino Dipartimento di Chimica) Gloria Berlier (Laboratory Universita di Torino Dipartimento di Chimica) Andrea Martini (Laboratory Universita di Torino Dipartimento di Chimica) Silvia Bordiga (Laboratory Universita di Torino Dipartimento di Chimica)</figDesc></figure>
