<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of this experiment was to perform Inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) under pressure on BaTiO 3 in order to see the change in the dynamics as inferred from previous x-ray scattering and absorption measurements <ref type="bibr">(Ravy et al., PRL99, 117601;</ref><ref type="bibr">Itié et al. EPL74, 706)</ref>. This experiment took place in two parts. After the first run, it was realized that a slight misalignement of the beamline had reduced the incident intensity by a sizeable factor. The beamline staff kindly provided us with a second run in which much better results were obtained. These results are summarized here.</p><p>The energy scans have been performed around the (2 2 0) and the (3 -1 0) Bragg reflections, but the inelastic signal were found to be strongest around the (2 2 0) reflection. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> summarizes the explored reciprocal points. k (220) (310) Diffuse lines Typical scans are displayed on figure 2 and figure 3. At high pressure, the quality of the crystal degraded, which provided an non negligible additional elastic contribution to the spectra. Because of that, the pressure dependence of the AS was measured at the 3 meV energy. The insert of igure 2 shows that this scattering decreases to zero at about 10 GPa.  Because the QE and the AS are only visible on the diffuse sheets and that their intensity decreases the same way that the diffuse scattering under pressure <ref type="bibr">(Ravy et al., PRL99, 117601)</ref>, we conclude from this study that the diffuse sheets oberved by X-ray are due to the QE+AS scattering.</p><p>We suggest that this scattering is due to the relaxational mode recently measured by <ref type="bibr">Hlinka et al. PRL101, 167402 (2008)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Sylvain Ravy*, Jean-Paul Itié*: Synchrotron SOLEIL, Gif/Yvette, France Alain Polian* : Institut de Minéralogie et Physique des Milieux Condensés -CNRS UMR 7590, Université P. et M.

Along the diffuse lines the TA and LA modes are visible around 13 meV and 10 meV. Moreover two new features are clearly visible : a strong quasielastic line (i.e. around zero energy) and a strong additional inelastic scattering (AS) in between the QE and the LA modes.</figDesc></figure>
