<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Interaction of a crystal with a permanent external electric field is well known in the form of the macroscopic phenomena such as dielectric polarization and converse piezoelectric effect. Deeper insights into the nature of the corresponding physical properties of solids (dielectricity and piezoelectricity) may be obtained by investigating the time dependence of the various processes that are initiated in a crystal by an ultra-fast change of an external electric perturbation state. In order to realize this experiment we applied periodically to single crystal plates a 2-step modulated high voltage (HV), consisting of U + = 1 kV and U -= -1 kV HV states (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), with a frequency up to 3 kHz. The switching time between the both different HV states was of the order of 200 ns. The time-resolved scanning of the diffraction intensity for each single angle step of a ω-rocking curve (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) was performed using a commercial FPGA-board. In detail, the incoming digital signals of a scintillation counter were assigned to successive up to 20 ns short single time channels. The smallest time window of 20 ns that can be used is limited by the board clock frequency of 100 MHz, whereas the SRAM implemented on the FPGA restricts the number of time channels to 2 18 . All measurements were carried out on a single crystal diffractometer at the BM01A (Swiss-Norwegian) beamline. To make visible the relaxation process of a crystal the time resolution was chosen in the range between 100 ns and 20 ns. Especially in the 20nsmode we had severe counting statistics problems. Therefore each conducted measurement had to be repeated several times, so that by far not all relevant aspects of the experiment could be considered.</p><p>In addition to our measurements in June 2008 performed at Li 2 SO 4 ⋅H 2 O crystal (see user report HS3355 [1]), during this beamtime we focussed on the piezoelectric response of BiB 3 O 6 crystal. Compared to Li 2 SO 4 ⋅H 2 O BiB 3 O 6 exhibits a more than two times larger piezoelectric effect. We used a 0.5 mm thick (010) crystal plate and applied HV via thin gold contacts exactly sputtered on top of each other. In addition, this time we investigated the influence of the HV frequency on the observed relaxation process. The corresponding information was extracted from the shift of the Bragg peak position of single reflections, ∆ω,</p></div>

Furthermore, the FPGA-based data acquisition system was adjusted to a maximum time resolution of 20 ns (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>), which is by a factor of 5 better than in June 2008. As already seen in previous experiment the sample responds by oscillation behaviour to the fast switch of HV. These oscillations are interpreted by piezoelectric-generated elastic waves propagating through the crystal area illuminated by the X-ray beam. As shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> there are at least three different frequencies. At this, the recorded response function, ∆ω(t,HV(t)), was fitted by the following equation (see fitted red curves):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3 0 1 exp( )cos( ) i i i i i A t t a γ ω δ = - -+ ∑ . (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>Using this approach we could describe quite well the measured oscillation behaviour of single Bragg peak positions (see Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>) that is related to the piezoelectric-induced macroscopic strains in BiB 3 O 6 . At the same time the HV frequency seems to be crucial for the validity of our model, compared to the measurements presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> in case of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> the HV frequency was slightly changed from 1 kHz to 975 Hz. By changing the HV frequency to 3 kHz we obtained the curves displayed in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>. Fig. 2 Representation of the time-resolved scanning of the diffraction intensity of a (3 9 2) reflection of a (010) BiB 3 O 6 crystal plate carried out with the ω-scan method. In this case the time resolution was 100 ns and due to the low counting statistics the measurements were repeated 5 times and then merged together. The width of the ω-steps was fixed to 2x10 -3 deg and the frequency of the HV was 1 kHz. Fig. 3 Shift of the Bragg peak position, ∆ω, of a (3 9 2) reflection measured as a function of time and HV state (the HV frequency was 1 kHz). The both red curves were fitted to the experimental data using the approach described by equation (1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our time-resolved studies could successfully probe the response of BiB 3 O 6 to an ultra-fast switch of an applied external electric field. Measuring the time dependence of the Bragg peak position of selected reflections on a time scale between 20 ns and 100 ns and using the approach described by equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) three different piezoelectric-induced elastic waves could be extracted propagating in the ( <ref type="formula">010</ref>) BiB 3 O 6 crystal plate: 1 2 3 135.7(2) kHz, 90.4(2) kHz, 3 kHz.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ν ν ν = = ≈</formula><p>(2) As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>, a time resolution of 20 ns gives a much better fit to the measured data. Therefore in future this time resolution will be used as a standard setting as soon as the counting statistics problems are overcome. The first both frequencies (2) are in the same range as those measured in June 2008 for Li 2 SO 4 ⋅H 2 O (see user report HS3355 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>) and reported by <ref type="bibr">Reuwijk (2002)</ref> [2] in case of KD 2 PO 4 . Considering the spatial extension of the used BiB 3 O 6 crystal plate these frequencies can be associated with elastic waves that are generated at one edge of the plate and hereafter propagate throughout the crystal media until they are reflected by another crystal edge. In contrast, the value of the third frequency (2) is far too small for a propagating elastic wave. According to the performed measurements (see <ref type="bibr">Figs. 3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4 and 5)</ref> this mode of the electric-field-induced elastic waves in BiB 3 O 6 is highly dependent on the frequency of the applied HV and shows resonance behaviour close to the HV frequency of 1 kHz. This observation has to be investigated in a more precise way in further experiments.</p><p>Finally, we have to note that the experimental data can also be evaluated in terms of the change of diffraction intensities and FWHMs of Bragg peaks. This data treatment is still in progress.</p><p>[1]. S. Gorfman, O. Schmidt, M. Ziolkowski, U. Pietsch. Experimental user report HS3355 <ref type="bibr">(June, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>[2].
