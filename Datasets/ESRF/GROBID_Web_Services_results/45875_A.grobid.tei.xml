If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. An unsolved and crucial question in electrochemistry is the issue of charge transfer between the metal electrode and the adsorbate as this defines the nature of the bonding. There have been few experimental electrochemical studies due to the complexity of the electrochemical environment which makes the surface inaccessible to most probes of charge transfer. Surface x-ray resonant diffraction (SXRRD) is one of the few techniques that may be applicable for probing the charge distribution at the electrochemical interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title: Resonant</head><p>On Cu(100), Br and Cl form ordered c(2x2) adlayers that have been observed in both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) [1] and electrochemical studies [2-3] (a schematic of the structure is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). SXRD analysis of Cu(001)-c(2x2)-Cl (formed in a defined potential range in HCl) showed a corrugation in the second atomic copper layer which is opposite in phase to the corrugation observed for Cu(100)-Cl under UHV conditions. This reveals the importance of charge screening by the solvent molecules and the major influence of the electrochemical double layer on the charge distribution at the interface. The c(2x2) adlayer is a simple structure (the adlayer forms a square structure with a coverage of 0.5 halide atoms per surface Cu atom) and this makes the system an ideal candidate to investigate the suitability of resonant surface x-ray scattering experiments to probe the charge transfer and nature of the chemical bonding in-situ. Measurements through the Cu K-edge at the anti-Bragg position of a Cu crystal truncation rod (CTR) for both Br and Cl are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. In both cases the edge shifts to higher energy values compared to the Cu bulk value indicating stronger bound core electrons. In a simple qualitative interpretation this implies that the surface Cu atoms are positively charged. Interestingly, measurements through the Cu K edge at the superstructure rod, showed no near-edge shifts indicating that the atoms in the second Cu layer (atoms 2 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) do not contribute to the charge transfer. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the intensity measured through the Br K edge at (0 1 0.2), which probes the chemical character of the Br adatoms. A shift of the edge to lower energies at this position indicates that the Br K-electrons are less tightly bound and therefore negatively charged. The data shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> are representative of a comprehensive data set and this is currently under analysis.
