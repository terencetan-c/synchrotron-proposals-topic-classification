<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Crystals of two distantly related E.coli outer membrane iron transport proteins were grown. For the first protein we collected a native data set which diffracted to 4Å resolution on beamline ID14_2. 140 images were collected with an oscillation angle of 1.5º. The data was 99.8% complete with a redundancy of 4.1. The data were scaled using Mosflm and Scala and the space group was C2. The unit cell constant are a = 107, b = 103, c = 90. Estimation of V m seems to indicate that only one transporter is present in the asymmetric unit and this corresponds to a solvent content of 59%. Molecular replacement programs AMoRe and Molrep were used to try and solve the phase problem. Initial results seem to show that a solution is obtainable. However higher resolution data is required.</p></div>			</div>
