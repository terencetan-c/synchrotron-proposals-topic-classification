<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>With nuclear resonant scattering of synchrotron radiation (SR) it is possible to determine directly the elementary diffusion jump of atoms in single-crystaline solids. In this project the scattering was measured in Bragg geometry. SR scattered from crystalline and amorphous media in the forward direction maintains its coherency. Disturbing effects like diffusion destroy coherency, and we can observe accelerated decay of intensity in forward direction. In crystalline solids the coherency should be preserved also for SR scattered in Bragg directions. One can expect that difmsionally accelerated decay of intensity will also occur in Bragg directions.</p><p>A furnace with a Fe3Si single crystal cut with its (220) plane normal to its surface was mounted on a goniometer head. The detector was placed in a position where the Bragg condition for the (220) plane was fulfilled. Resonant counts of 14.4 keV radiation were measured as a function of time after the prompt SR pulse at two temperatures (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The decrease of intensity at 850K corresponds to the undisturbed decay of 57Fe whereas at Model-calculations for a wave vector lQl= 7.3A' with components for scattering from the (220) plane Q = (6.15, -2.52, 3.03) predict effective decay rates of -2.2 and 1.0 (au.) and corresponding weights of 0.6 and 0.4 respectively (see Ref. [l] B.Sepiol,A.Meyer, G.Vogl, R.Riiffer, A.I.Churnakov, andA.Q.R. <ref type="bibr">Baron, Phys.Rev.Lett.76,3220 (1996)</ref>.</p><p>[2] B. <ref type="bibr">Sepiol, A.Meyer, G.Vogl, H.

B52,3356 (1995);</ref><ref type="bibr">B57,5788 (1998)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. Decay of SR intensity scattered from the crystal plane (220 ) FeJSi at 850K and lOOOK. lOOOK a difmsionally accelerated decay is clearly visible. The solid lines are fits of the data to the solutions of the scattering theory [3]. The results of the fitting procedure are compared with the predictions derived from a simple diffusion model [2].</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>[2]). Actually, the time dependence should be composed of two exponent&amp; -compare Fig.2. of Ref.[2]  where two-exponential decay was clearly visible. Unfortunately 16-bunch mode was not operational and we had to measure for 4 shifts in single bunch mode with insufficient intensity and another 1 shift in 32-bunch mode where only a 88 ns time window was available. Due to these limitations it was impossible to resolve the two-exponential decay. Nevertheless the d@ksionul acceleration of intensity decay in Bragg direction scattering could be dejinitly established as proved by the faster decay at IOOOK. This method of measurement has the following advantages compared to the forward scattering of SR: the prompt-signal intensity is strongly reduced compared to the forward scattering. This effect should be specially useful in backscattering geometry allowing measurements starting at shorter time after prompt Xray impulse, widen the available time window. In backscattering geometry one can investigate samples which are not accessible in transmission geometry.</figDesc></figure>
