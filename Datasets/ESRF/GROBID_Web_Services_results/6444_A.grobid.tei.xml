<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was twofold: 1. To measure the spatial coherence of synchrotron radiation, the 2 mirrors acting as variable Young slits 2 To start using the 2 mirror system to study 1 dimensional mesoscopic structures , consisting in a few mm size terraces with steps in the range IO-50 nm deposited on one of the mirrors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The first part of the work has been quite successful and has been published: see attached article <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>.</p><p>For the second part, several difficulties appeared: fl The mirrors alignment was done using 3 piezoelectric actuators under vacuum, The tilt motion of 2 piezo-actuated systems broke during the experiment and it was necessary to move the mirrors manually:</p><p>open the vacuum chamber, align, make vacuum several times. This costed a lot of time. Even increasing coherence, by putting small slits, the interference fringes are tilted in case of misalignment of the mirrors, and are averaged by the detector (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">2</ref>). n The lower flux (small slits) resulted in longer time per scan and gave rise to additional problems : the piezo-actuators were not stable enough, and he interference fringes were smoothed out by time averaging ; in addition, sudden changes occurred in piezo position destroying the interference pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>n The VCT6 electronics timed out very frequently, so that l/3 of the scans were interrupted. n To make holographic reconstruction of the structured mirrors it is necessary to measure the interference pattern at relatively large angles, where the intensity was very low After the experiment, several discussions with the firm of thePZT-actuated mirror (Melles Griot) help it to design and fabricate a truly UHV compatible PZT actuated system, which we have now in hand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I-/</head><p>We have performed computer simulated interference patterns (fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>), which show that holographic reconstruction (fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>) of the structure deposited on one mirror (even the simplest structure) is possible only with wider scans, where the intensity is lower, and thus requiring a longer acquisition time. However comparison of the experimental and the simulated far field pattern (fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). shows clearly that the effect of the structures on the pattern is well reproduced.</p><p>[ 11 K.
