<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Before our experiments at BM01 little was known about the ordering phenomena in mullite, in which Al/Si and vacancy ordering is present. Our laboratory experiments were not able to detect diffuse scattering and only sharp satellite reflections were visible. The resulting model is a fully ordered model, but requires the presence of a disordered phase. 9 different samples from 4 sample batches were measured at BM01 (single crystal X-ray diffraction, optimized for diffuse scattering and structure solution). The total measurement time of successful experiments was about 13 hours of the 24 available hours. The rest of the time was used for sample preparation, alignment, test measurements and measurements of low quality samples (e.g. poly crystalline).</p><p>The new measurements resulted in a new model for the modulated crystal structure of mullite and better understanding of it. First, the presence of diffuse scattering could clarify our main question concerning the disordered phase. On the other hand, the absence of higher order satellites shows that our ordered model does not correctly describe the structure of the measured samples. Data reductions (CrysAlis PRO) were carried out for 4 measurements and lead to the development of a new superspace model. The different refinements are basically the same, but they exhibit different modulation amplitudes, which is interpreted in terms of different degrees of ordering. It was known before, that ordered and disordered mullite exists, but our measurements show that a range of degrees of ordering exist. Our previous, ordered model is in full agreement with the new, disordered model, in the sense that the ordered model represents the highest degree of ordering.</p><p>Due to the great resolution and quality of the measurements, we were able to develop a new approach to define Al/Si ordering from the displacive modulation and the comparison of tetrahedra volumes with DFT calculations. The observed, average volume agrees perfectly with the expected value, and thus the modulation allows to define the Al/Si ordering on the tetrahedra sites. Thanks to the measurements at BM01 we could develop a consistent superspace model for a crystal structure, that is already investigated for about 50 years. The puzzle of vacancy and Al/Si ordering in mullite now for the first time allows to recognize the full picture.</p><p>We highly appreciate the given beamtime. We especially want to thank the beamline scientist Dr. Dmitry Chernyshov. It is also thanks to him and his maintenance of the beamline that our measurements were successful. In addition we thank the ESRF for financial support and a smooth organization of the stay at the synchrotron and at the guest house.</p><p>Parts of the measurements were presented as oral presentation at the following conferences: Ongoing work focuses on the diffuse scattering and we believe that at least two papers will result from the results obtained at BM01.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Faculty of Science and Technology University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Mullite-</head><figDesc>scheme is presented which explains the crystal chemical relationships between the split sites of the average structure. The modulation amplitudes of the refinements differ significantly by a factor of ~3, which is explained in terms of different degrees of ordering, i.e. vacancies follow the same ordering principle in all samples, but to different extents. A new approach is applied for the first time to determine the Al/Si ordering by combining density functional theory with the modulated volumes of the tetrahedra. The presence of Si-Si diclusters indicate that the mineral classification of mullite needs to be reviewed. A description of the crystal structure of mullite must both consider the chemical composition and the degree of ordering. This is of special importance for applications as advanced ceramic, because the physical properties depend on the intrinsic structure of mullite.</figDesc></figure>
