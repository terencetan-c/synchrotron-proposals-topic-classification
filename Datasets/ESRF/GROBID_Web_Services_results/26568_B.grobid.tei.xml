<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The final aim was un assessment of the feasibility and of the difficulties inherent to the association of X-ray microbeam and local probe microscopies. To this goal a special vacuum vessel has been designed and manufactured taking in account the constraints of the short working distance between the KB optical system and the sample, the short distance between the nose of the fluorescence detector used to align the tip on the beam, and finally the need of having enough slack on the alignment of the entire system.</p><p>No problem has been found on the general conception of the vacuum vessel and on its mechanical way of alignment. perform accurate simulations to determine the electron yield expected improve the current detection system (adapt it to very low currents)</p></div>

It has been then necessary to temporarily install a second optical microscope. From this experience we learnt that a consistent alignment can only be achieved by using TWO microscopes: one linked to the vacuum vessel and meant to align tip and sample on the same spot, and a second microscope fixed on the X-ray focal spot. Only in this condition it will be easy to align the two focii on the same point. A second point to verify was to ascertain the response of a tuning fork head equipped with a fiber optic. Question was to check if a first signal was visible and the level of noise. The experiment has been done on a quantum dot sample Er doped that luminesce on the visible. The figures below shows the intensity distribution on a uniform sample and on a QD sample. This last sample shows consistently a peak on the right side of the distribution that we attribute to signal from the QDs under X-ray excitation. The tip was a low resolution tip, then smearing out considerably the signal. The results of this first attempt shows in which directions we should proceed:</figDesc></figure>
