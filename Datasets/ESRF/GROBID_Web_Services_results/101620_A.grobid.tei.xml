Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts the changes in grain distribution resulting from amino acid incorporation. Mixing of Ca +2 +Mg +2 mixture solution with CO3 -2 solution results with instant precipitation of ACC particles in the liquid, yet as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A, the received particles are not uniform in size or shape. Amino acids incorporation in ACC synthesis is known to inhibit the formation of particles, and as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> B-D they play an important role in the formation of particles with uniform size and shape. This result was yet to be seen prior to this experiment and may offer another explanation to the found amino acids in organisms who use the amorphousto-crystalline transformation in nature. The varying concentration of amino acid is also an intriguing point, possibly resulting from their chemical structure.</p><p>The dependency of the Mg-to-amino acid ratio in the inhabitance of ACC particles formation and size\shape of the particles was also examined as depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. As can be seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> A, high Mg percentage results in small periodicity indicating uniformity in size and shape of the formed ACC particles. When the Mg to aspartic acid ratio is lowered in figure 2 B, the periodicity increases and a more uniform size distribution is formed. At lower ratios the particles formation is no longer inhibited and the periodicity cannot be observed. These results indicate that there is a specific ratio allowing both inhabitance and uniformity in grain size of the formed ACC particles.</p><p>The aforementioned results may shed light to an interesting phenomenon seen in nature where Mg-rich CaCO3 crystals with amino acid surrounding is used to form uniquely shaped and mechanically enhanced crystals through an amorphous precursor.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Small-angle X-ray scattering difractograms of ACC powders formed from 20% Ca and 80% Mg solutions incorporated with various amino acids.
