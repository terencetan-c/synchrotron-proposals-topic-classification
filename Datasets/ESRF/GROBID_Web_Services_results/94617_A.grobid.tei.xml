<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) metallic ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 is a perfect model material to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions. Such materials, possessing magnetic ordering in a single atomic layer limit, are considered as magnetic analogues of graphene and very promising for development of advanced spintronics and nanoelectronics technologies. Due to weak inter-layer van der Waals forces, it is expected that magnetic, structural and other physical properties of these materials can be easily tuned by changes of thermodynamic parameterspressure and temperature. In order to provide detailed insight into modification of microscopic magnetic and electronic properties of Fe3GeTe2 and, especially, search for spin crossover phenomena, one needs high pressurelow temperature techniques sensitive to local magnetic interactions in materials, such as synchrotron Mossbauer spectroscopy (SMS). For these purposes, we propose to perform experiments at ID18 by SMS in pressure range 0-30 GPa and temperature range 4-300 K.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the restrictions corresponded with the epidemia of the COVID-18 virus in the France and around the world, we had to register a remote experiment and send a sample by post mail. As a result of unexpected influences, possibly during sample parcel delivery, the initial Fe3GeTe2 sample was chemically degraded and lost the original two-dimensional structure of the magnet. The rapid sending of another sample was not possible under the current epidemiological limitation. The previously planned experiments were not carried out.</p><p>In any case, we would like to note the well-coordinated work of the ID-18 beamline team. Everything possible was done on their part.</p><p>We plan to re-send proposal to another time and hope to solve this interesting problem in the nearest future.</p></div>			</div>
