<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig 7. Examining the diffusion properties of different axonal geometries. (A) The morphological features of the XNH-segmented axons in Figs. 3 and 4 are directly mapped to the six different axon classes generated for MC simulations. G1, straight cylinders of diameter corresponding to XNH axon mean diameters; G2, same as G1 plus segmented OD; G3, segmented OD and longitudinal ADD; G4, segmented OD and microdispersion; G5, segmented OD, microdispersion, and longitudinal ADD; and G6, the XNH segmentation. (B) The variation of estimated AD and (C) parallel intraaxonal ADC with diffusion time for geometries G1-G6. Error bars represent the SE, reflecting the spread in diameters/ADCs across the individual axons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>By performing high-resolution 3D XNH on intact white matter samples from a monkey brain, we demonstrate the interplay between extra-axonal structures (blood vessels, cells, vacuoles) and the micromorphology of axons. Contrary to Deiters' century-old description of axons as cylinders, we find that AD and tra-jectory vary along the length of the axon, often due to obstacles in the local microstructural environment. These morphological changes entail that large axons are nonspecific in terms of di-ameter and CV. We thus question the value of precisely mea-suring their diameters and the validity of enforcing cylindrical geometries in axonal structure-function relationships. Further-more, we show that the 3D morphologies of axons may drive previously reported trends in 2D AD distributions and g-ratio distributions. Our results have significant impact for AD deter-mination with 2D techniques and-as we show here-diffusion MRI. We foresee that a thorough morphological characteriza-tion of axons and their structural context will guide the nonin-vasive investigation of axon morphology with diffusion MRI and, consequently, the investigation of brain network function.</p><p>For full text, please see <ref type="url" target="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/52/33649.short">https://www.pnas.org/content/117/52/33649.short</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.

(B) Fifty-four axons from the splenium of the monkey brain translated to a common origin to illustrate the mesoscopic dispersion within the volume. Axon color represents inclination angle compared to the z axis. The Inset shows the quantification of microdispersion along axons: The axon is aligned with the z axis and a window of length L slides along the axon centerline (blue) at intervals of L/4. A principalcomponent analysis is performed on points within the window to determine their directionality. The inclination angle to the z axis is calculated and averaged over all windows.

(A) Six long axons segmented from the extended cylindrical XNH volume of the monkey splenium shown in Fig. 2 A and D. The stars mark identified nodes of Ranvier. (B) Inner AD vs. outer fiber diameter (including myelin sheath) at N randomly sampled points along the internodes of the six axons. Straight lines represent linear fits to the six datasets. The high linear correlation suggests that the myelin thickness remains approximately constant along the internodes, and that the y intercept is representative of twice the myelin thickness. (C) Histograms and associated gamma distribution fits of CVs along the internodes of axons 1, 2, and 6. (D) Row 1: segmentation of long axon (number 5, black, in A and B), colored according to diameter. The dotted squares marked r1-r9 indicate nine ROIs. Black stars mark the positions of the nodes of Ranvier. Row 2: ROI intensity images. The red lines show a manual segmentation of the inner axonal boundary and the outer myelin boundary, respectively. At r1 and r7, nodes of Ranvier are shown in an orthogonal view. At r6, the axon (yellow) is squeezed by two vacuoles (green). Row 3: on Left: ADD along axon. Blue line: the longitudinal equivalent AD measured every 150 nm along the axonal trajectory. In orange, the g-ratio for the 9 marked ROIs and 20 additional randomly generated positions along the axon.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,34.64,38.02,533.00,517.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>

(A) XNH image looking into a vessel, marked V. Cell nuclei, marked by an asterisk, cluster around the vessel. The vessel significantly impacted the nearby axonal trajectories, depicted by the red arrow. (B) Three-dimensional reconstruction of A. Fifteen segmented axons are colored according to the deviation from their expected linear trajectories (a linear interpolation of the axon centerline above and below the blood vessel). Yellow, strong deviation; dark blue, little/no deviation. (C) Deviation from expected linear trajectory as a function of distance along the axon, centered on the maximum deviation. (D and E) Three-dimensional reconstructions of select cell clusters (blue), vacuoles (green), and axons, whose diameters are given by the color bar, in the XNH volume of the monkey splenium shown in Fig. 3B. The axon trajectories are impacted by the presence of cell clusters, and their diameters and shapes are impacted by neighboring vacuoles. (F) Threedimensional reconstruction of axons in an XNH volume of a crossing fiber region. Two different projection directions are marked by green and yellow. Two axons, colored red and blue, twist around each other.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,34.64,38.02,523.10,432.22" type="bitmap" /></figure>
