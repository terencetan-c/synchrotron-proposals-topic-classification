<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The coelacanth Latimeria is an iconic fish closely related to land dwelling vertebrates, the tetrapods. Latimeria is critical for our understanding of the origin of tetrapods, but its development has remained virtually unknown since its discovery in 1938. To fill this gap, we gathered specimens of different developmental stages housed in natural history collections, and performed high resolution phase contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography on this unique developmental series. The sum of data collected at the ESRF allowed us to study the development of the most remarkable anatomical features of Latimeria, such as its hinged braincase and brain (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This work represents signficant contributions to our understanding of vertebrate evolution. These studies have been published in top peer-reviewed journals, and attracted media coverage in France and abroad. Raw data obtained at the ESRF and 3D digital reconstructions associated with publications were made publicly available on online repositories (<ref type="url" target="http://phenome10k.org">http://phenome10k.org</ref> and <ref type="url" target="http://paleo.esrf.fr">http://paleo.esrf.fr</ref>).</p></div>

The development of the notochord appears to have a major effect on the surrounding cranial components, and might underpin the formation of the intracranial joint. Our results shed light on the interplay between the neurocranium and its adjacent soft tissues during development in Latimeria, and provide insights into the developmental mechanisms that are likely to have underpinned the evolution of neurocranial diversity in sarcopterygian fishes. <ref type="bibr">Cupello C., Brito P.

Nature Communications 6: 8222. <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9222">https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9222</ref> Abstract: Coelacanths are lobe-finned fishes known from the Devonian to Recent that were long considered extinct, until the discovery of two living species in deep marine waters of the Mozambique Channel and Sulawesi. Despite extensive studies, the pulmonary system of extant coelacanths has not been fully investigated.</p><p>Here we confirm the presence of a lung and discuss its allometric growth in Latimeria chalumnae, based on a unique ontogenetic series. Our results demonstrate the presence of a potentially functional, well-developed lung in the earliest known coelacanth embryo, and its arrested growth at later ontogenetic stages, when the lung is clearly vestigial. The parallel development of a fatty organ for buoyancy control suggests a unique adaptation to deep-water environments. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for the presence of small, hard, flexible plates around the lung in L. chalumnae, and consider them homologous to the plates of the 'calcified lung' of fossil coelacanths.

However, it remains unclear whether the similarity in the asymmetrical endoskeletal arrangement of the pectoral fins of coelacanths reflects the evolution of the pectoral appendages in sarcopterygians. Here, we describe for the first time the development of the pectoral fin and shoulder girdle in the extant coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae, based on the tomographic acquisition of a growth series. The pectoral girdle and pectoral fin endoskeleton are formed early in development with a radially outward growth of the endoskeletal elements. The visualization of the pectoral girdle during development shows a reorientation of the girdle between the fetus and pup 1 stages, creating a contact between the scapulocoracoids and the clavicles in the ventro-medial region. Moreover, we observed a splitting of the preand post-axial cartilaginous plates in respectively pre-axial radials and accessory elements on one hand, and in post-axial accessory elements on the other hand. However, the mechanisms involved in the splitting of the cartilaginous plates appear different from those involved in the formation of radials in actinopterygians. Our results show a proportional reduction of the proximal pre-axial radial of the fin, rendering the external morphology of the fin more lobe-shaped, and a spatial reorganization of elements resulting from the fragmentation of the two cartilaginous plates. Latimeria development hence supports previous interpretations of the asymmetrical pectoral fin skeleton as being plesiomorphic for coelacanths and sarcopterygians.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 3D digital reconstruction of the head structures of a coelacanth embryo (Dutel et al. 2019 Nature).
