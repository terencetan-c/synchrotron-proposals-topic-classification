<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>CrO 3 , chromium(VI) oxide, has a 1-dimensional crystal structure formed by infinite single chains of corner linked CrO 4 -tetrahedra. When heated, CrO 3 will decompose through several steps to chromium(III) oxide, Cr 2 O 3 . The thermal decomposition of CrO 3 has been the topic of many studies, but the decomposition sequence and the structures and stoichiometry of the intermediate mixed valence chromium oxides are still not fuly understood. The decomposition is strongly dependent on e.g. pressure, oxygen partial pressure and traces of moisture. Several mixed-valence compounds have been identified in the decomposition sequence. A compound known as Cr 3 O 8 was shown by structure determination(1) to have the true composition Cr 8 O 21 . It is triclinic, a = 5.433, b = 6.557, c = 12.117Å, α = 106.36, β = 95.73 and γ = 77.96º and contains chromium(III), chromate-and tetrachromate groups, and the composition can be given as Cr(III)(Cr(VI)O 4 ) 2 (Cr(VI) 4 O 13 ). The existence of one or more phases with composition Cr 2 O 5 (Cr 6 O 15 ) has been reported, but no structural information is available. Cr 5 O 12 was syntesized at high pressure, and the structure has been determined. In Cr 5 O 12 chromium(III) is connected by chromate groups, and the composition can be given as: Cr(III) 2 (Cr(VI)O 4 ). Thus the transformation sequence observed is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CrO 3 → Cr 8 O 21 → Cr 6 O 15 (Cr 2 O 5 ) → (Cr 5 O 12 ) → Cr 2 O 3 .</formula><p>When taking into account the appropriate oxidation states of chromium, the compounds are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Cr(VI)O 3 → Cr(</formula><p>III) 2 Cr(VI) 6 O 21 → Cr(III) 2 Cr(VI) 4 O 15 → Cr(III) 2 Cr(VI) 3 O 12 → Cr(III) 2 O 3 . A systematic change in stoichiometry is observed. A couple of interesting missing stoichiometries are: Cr 7 O 18 (Cr(III) 2 Cr(VI) 5 O 18 ) and Cr 4 O 8 (Cr(III) 2 Cr(VI) 2 O 8 ). Cr 7 O 18 has so far not been observed, but it could exist as a chromium chromate trichromate, Cr(III)(Cr(VI)O 4 ) 2 (Cr(VI) 3 O 10 ). Cr 4 O 8 does exist (CrO 2 )</p><p>; not as a mixed valence compound, but as a chromium(IV) oxide. High resolution powder diffraction was used to follow the thermal decomposition of CrO 3 and Cr 8 O 21 under various reaction conditions, such as different oxygen partial pressures. The aim was to identify new phases in the decomposition sequence, and to resolve the issue concerning the structure of Cr 6 O 15 (Cr 2 O 5 ). </p></div>

The formation of an intermediate phase is clearly visible. During the experiments several different, but closely related, phases with assumed composition close to Cr 2 O 5 (Cr 6 O 15 ) were obtained. One of the phases has been indexed based on a triclinic unit cell, a = 6.561, b = 8.401, c = 8.951Å, α = 99.95, β = 73.16 and γ = 89.06º. The structure determination is not yet completed. 1. P.
