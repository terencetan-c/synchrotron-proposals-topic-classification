<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment, we focused on the elemental composition and structure of the mineral part of "normal" and pathological (Osteogenesis Imperfecta: OI) bone specimen using micro-spectroscopic techniques (XANES and X-ray fluorescence). On the ID21 beamline, we worked at the Ca edge (4.1 keV) and P edge (2.16 keV) for specimen analyses by Xray fluorescence and XANES micro-spectroscopies. We obtained:</p><p>-XANES spectra of Ca and P in "normal" and pathological bone specimen to examine if Ca and/or P environment varies depending on the patient health.</p><p>-X-ray fluorescence spectra of the various bone specimen to identify and semi-quantify major elements (Ca and P) and some minor elements such as Na, Mg, Fe, F.</p><p>-Elemental mapping within and around an osteon with a spatial resolution of 1 µm</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and method</head><p>The bone specimen have been prepared at the Laboratoire de Recherches Orthopédiques UMR CNRS 7052, Faculté de Médecine Lariboisière, Paris, France. They have been fixed, dehydrated and embedded in PMMA resin. The block have been cut into slices (&lt;1 mm of thickness) using high speed microtome saw. Then, bone cross sections were hand polished using first 2400 sandpaper and then alumina slurry (0.5 µm particle size). Further polishing have been done at ESRF with diamond powder (0.25 µm particle size) before analyses. Due to OI bone fragility, the reduction of bone cross sections thickness is limited (thickness &gt; 100 µm) which compromises the analysis in transmission mode and thus affects the quality of the signal collected in the fluorescence mode. We analyzed 12 specimens from 2 to 17 years old young patients 7 specimens are from young patients without any bone constitutive pathology ("normal") and 5 specimens are from patients suffering from Osteogenesis Imperfecta (1 moderate and 4 severe cases). We especially focused our investigations in regions of specimen around osteons which are areas of active bone remodelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We present in this report the first results obtained for 2 "normal" specimens (20_3 and 33_2) and 2 OI specimens (gal_4 and bal_2) of the same age (6 and 10 years old, respectively). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> showed the X ray fluorescence spectra of "normal" and pathological specimens in the range of X ray emission lines of some minor elements. Systematically, we notice significant difference in peaks intensity between "normal" and OI specimens. In table 1, we reported an evaluation of some minor elements proportion calculated from intensities ratio normalized for each spectrum to the phosphorus peak intensity at 2013 eV. Higher levels of F, Fe and Mg are found in OI specimens whereas the level of Na is lower.</p><p>0 0,01 0,02 0,03 0,04 600 900 1200 1500 Energy of X-ray em ission lines (eV) intensity 20_3 gal_4 (OI) 33_2 bal_2 (OI)</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows XANES spectra (after normalization of the jump between 4 and 4.15 keV) of the same "normal" and OI specimens. Several similar and different features can be noticed by examining these spectra (splitting and intensity of the white line, presence of 2 pre-peak).
