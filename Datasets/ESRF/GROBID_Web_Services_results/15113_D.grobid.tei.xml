<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In earlier studies solvent evaporation from nanoparticle dispersions (7 nm in sized Ag nanocrystals) on a substrate has shown to form ordered superstructures when adsorbed to substrate. Utilising this property the potential thus exists to assemble &lt;100 Å heterostructures from mixed solutions of conducting and non-conducting nanoparticles.</p><p>In the pursuit of understanding the factors under which such mixed superstructures are formed mixed SiO 2 and Ag solutions were self-assembled onto a substrate and studied by SAXS. The solutions contained 9 nm sized SiO 2 nanoparticles and 6 nm sized Agnanoparticles modified with long chain alkanes and dissolved in CHCl 3 . Pure solutions and mixtures were then evaporated onto mica substrates.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the SAXS spectrum of a 6 nm sized monodisperse Ag crystals. A strong diffraction peak clearly appears at about q= 0.1 Å -1 and a second peak at about q=0.2 Å -1 . Earlier studies has shown this structure to be representative of intermediate range order and the position of the first peak to correlate with the centre to centre distance of the particles in the superstructure. In Fig 2</p><p>the spectrum obtaind from the SiO 2 -particles is also shown. Although this spectrum is find to be much less structured a clear diffraction peak at q= 0.07 Å -1 is indicating at least short rang ordering and/or a slightly less mono dispersed sample.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the SAXS spectrum obtained from mixtures of these two solutions. Although the slight polydispersity in these samples prevent from quantitative conclustions, comparisons with the pure spectra can be used for an qualitative understanding. This must be done keeping in mind that the scattering intensity is proportional to the electron density the mixed samples is thus dominated by the scattering from the Ag particles. The first conclusion drawn is that the spectra obtained from the mixed samples are not a convolution of the spectra pure spectra in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Secondly, following the main Ag interference peak it shifts towards lower q upon addition of the SiO2-particles. Thus the mix assemblies do not contain pure SiO 2 and Ag phases. Instead a new mixed phases seams to form in which Ag and SiO 2 particles are mixed together. Further studies are on going and absorption spectra electron micrographs are cinsistent with such a picture.</p><p>The interaction between two monodisperse nanocrystals modified with a molecular substrate capable of a recognition process has been studied. The objective of the study is to determine if, in the presence of a bi-functional receptor molecule, silver nanocrystals can be self-assembled via the formation of the desired receptor-substrate complex (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6HOI DVVHPEO\ RI 1DQRSDUWLFOH PL[WXUHV ± 0RGLILHG $J 1DQRFWU\VWDOV</head><p>Although ordinary light scattering techniques can monitor the formation of large aggregates in solution and supply us with information regarding fractal dimensions, it does not provide structural information as to the order of these aggregates. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a particularly useful tool in this regard and has been used to study superlattice formation arising from self-assembly of monodisperse silver nanocrystals.</p><p>Two experiments were performed. First, the degree of monodispersity had to be determined. From SAXS measurements of condensed silver nanocrystals superlattice diffraction peaks were recorded indicating an ordered arrangement of monodisperse silver nanocrystals (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Second, the self-assembly of silver nanocrystals into a superlattice in solution was recorded. We did not observe any diffraction peaks indicative of an ordered array of silver nanocrystals in solution.</p><p>Following from these results, we conclude that the arrangement of silver nanocrystals in solution may not be close-packed, therefore precluding the observation of diffraction peaks from an ordered array. Instead, the resultant aggregate may be fractal in nature i.e. the silver nanocrystals self-assemble into an open, random structure. This is being investigated using ordinary light scattering techniques. Such information regarding the self-assembly process requires a new approach to obtaining SAXS data on this system.</p><p>It is felt that this information would facilitate a worthwhile SAXS investigation of this novel system.</p><p>q (Å -1 ) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Intensity (arb. units.) 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 Ag-nanoparticles 6 nm SiO 2 -nanoparticles 9 nm</p><p>)LJXUH q (Å -1 ) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 intensity arb.units 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 SiO 2 :Ag (ratio 1:1) SiO 2 :Ag (ratio 1:5) SiO 2 :Ag (ratio 5:1) )LJXUH )LJXUH 1DQRFU\VWDO DVVHPEO\ EDVHG RQ UHFHSWRUVXEVWUDWH IRUPDWLRQ )LJXUH 6$;6 RI VXSHUODWWLFH IRUPHG E\ HYDSRUDWLRQ RI D QDQRFU\VWDO GLVSHUVLRQ RQ D PLFD VXEVWUDWH q (A -1 ) 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 Log I(q) 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 (111) (200) (220) (311) (222) d 111 =78 A 0</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>RI DSSOLFDQWV (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Donald Fitzmaurice*, Department of Chemistry, University College Dublin, IRELAND.
