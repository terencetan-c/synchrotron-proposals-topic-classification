<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Rechargeable metal-air battery can be a promising energy storage device for renewable energy due to its safety, high theoretical energy density and low cost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Electrochemical oxygen catalysis, including oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), plays the critical role in the capacity of metal-air batteries. To develop state-of-the-art metal-air batteries, it is significant to have a deep understanding of catalytic mechanism for OER/ORR, such as the potential structural reconstruction and the real active sites on catalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VtC-XES and HERFD-XANES tests</head><p>Our previous experiment results indicate that metal carbodiimides (MNCN) can be a promising catalyst for oxygen catalysis. In this experiment at ID 26, valence to core X-ray emission spectroscopy (VtC-XES) and highenergy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption near-edge structure (HERFD-XANES) spectroscopy were employed to uncover the subtle change of local geometry and electronic property in cobalt carbodiimidebased catalysts during ORR and OER. Experiments first started from the beam damage test for sample pellets to determine the measurement method. Next, ex-situ VtC-XES and HERFD-XANES spectra of samples, including pellets and electrodes, were recorded. Because of the serious influence from the bubbles caused by beam irradiation and the intense beam absorption from KOH electrolyte, the electrochemical reaction was performed under several potential in a cell for 1 hour in advance, and then the electrodes were dried quickly and measured. VtC-XES and HERFD-XANES spectra of CoNCN loading on oxidized carbon nanotubes (CoNCN/O-CNTs) during ORR and highly/lowly crystalline-(HC/LC-) CoNCN during OER were collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The CoNCN/O-CNTs electrode was first investigated under various potential for ORR by HERFD-XANES. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), with the applied potential decreasing from 1.0 V to 0.5 V, the position of absorption edge does not show obvious change, indicating that the valence state of cobalt center still remains the same. It is noticed that the white line peak has a slight blue shift after contacting the KOH electrolyte possibly due to the absorption of oxygen-contained species on cobalt surface. Two peaks can be observed in pre-edge region. After the subtraction of the background, peak fitting was done for the pre-edge peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>). In CoNCN, cobalt center has an octahedral coordination with high spin state (t2g 5 eg 2 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Because of this centrosymmetric geometry, the direct 3d 7 →1s 1 3d 8 quadrupole transition is allowed while the dipole transition is forbidden. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Moreover, 3d-4p mixing is not allowed in octahedral coordination. Since there are two excited state configurations (t2g 6 eg 2 and t2g 5 eg 3 ), the first peak at lower energy can be attributed to the 1s→t2g transition while the second peak at higher energy can be regarded as the 1s→eg transition. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>, after the application of potential, the pre-edge peak position has the negligible change, but the contribution of 1s→eg transition shows an upward trend. Considering that there should be only one pre-edge peak at the similar position of 1s→eg transition for Co 2+ with the low spin state theoretically, the average spin state of Co 2+ in CoNCN/O-CNTs during ORR may decrease. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(c), the position of two peaks in Kβ2,5 region is similar. Thus, we concluded there is no irreversible phase transition in CoNCN/O-CNTs during ORR. CoNCN with different crystallinity was also investigated before and after OER. Both of post-catalytic electrodes show a blue shift of absorption edge (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>), revealing an increase of the average valence state of Co. Interestingly, they display the different terminal state after OER according to the position of pre-edge and main absorption edge. While LC-CoNCN shows a remarkable phase transition, HC-CoNCN seems to partially keep the initial component. In VtC-XES region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(e)), the shape change and peak shifting in Kβ2,5 region demonstrate that both of two catalysts underwent structural reconstruction after OER. To have a clearer answer for some questions, like the exact coordination around cobalt after OER and the contribution of the transition in VtC region, we still need to combine theoretical calculation and other characterization technique.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
