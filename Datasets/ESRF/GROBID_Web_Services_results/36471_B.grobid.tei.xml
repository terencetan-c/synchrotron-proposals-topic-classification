<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report on first grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering test measurements at ROBL.</p><p>Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAXS) is an increasingly important structural characterization technique and finds its application in nanostructures and nanocomposites investigations at surfaces and interfaces. The GISAXS method can be used as a complementary method to conventional surface-sensitive tools such as scanning probe microscopy and electron microscopy. The GISAXS technique is, like any X-ray technique, a non-destructive one and therefore can be easily used in situ and in real time investigations to monitor the formation of the nanostructure or nanocomposite, that is a great advantage to understand the kinetics of nanoassembly processes. Moreover GISAXS can be used to investigate nondestructively structures just below a surface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this test experiment was to expand the experimental capabilities of the ROBL beamline, especially in material research. Therefore, we conducted a series of tests to find out the experimental conditions to operate the beamline for an optimal GISAXS experiment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the principal setup of a GISAXS experiment. As a detector we used a MARCCD with a detector radius of 165 mm. The detector was placed 3 m behind the sample. To reduce air scattering, tests were carried out at 11 keV and a He filled flightg tube was employedto following the beam path.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2:</head><p>The GISAXS scattering pattern of a free standing InAs quantum dot sample was measured at an incidence angle of 0.3 degree; the out of plane intesity distribution is shown for a sample rotation angle of 0 and 90 degree; the in-plane patteren is composed of 36 scans and shown for an exit angle of 0.3 degree as well. The inset shows a similar in-plane pattern measured at the BW2 at HASYLAB. Therefore, the GISAXS measurements can be carried out at the ROBL beamline taking into account the synchrotron beam characteristics at a bending magnet, the need of a longer counting time and a higher sample -detector distance to increase resolution. For routine operations a double beam stop (for the direct and reflected beam) as well as an optimized flight tube should be installed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimental GISAXS setup; for |Θ| &gt; 0 is the scattering vector almost parallel to the sample surface that allows determining the lateral structure. Using a 2D detector a Q inplane and Q z reciprocal space map could be recorded at once.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 shows a GISAXS scattering pattern of a freestanding InAs quantum dot sample grown on a GaAs substrate. The sample was provided by M. Schmidbauer (Institut für Kristallzüchtung, Max-Born-Straße 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany). The sample shows a clear one dimensional short range ordering with an average dot distance of about 80nm. The inset shows the GISAXS scattering measured under similar conditions (E = 10keV) at the BW2 beamline at HASYLAB.</figDesc></figure>
