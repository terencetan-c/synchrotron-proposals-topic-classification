<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Kinetic experiments have afforded the opportunity to understand the evolution of crystalline phases as a material crystallises from an amorphous state. The purpose of this work was to exploit a kinetic diffraction technique in order to investigate two current questions regarding metallic glasses that are of considerable technological importance: (i) Pd 40 Ni (40-x) Fe x P 2 : Amorphous metallic alloys are normally prepared as melt spun ribbons or sputtered films, making use of the quenching technique or evaporation technique respectively. More recently alloys have also been formed as 'bulk' metallic glasses (BMG's) in mm dimensions. Although for conventional amorphous ribbons glass-formation is determined by the use of exceptionally high cooling rates, for BMGs this aspect is less essential. For these alloys the constituent atoms have a tendency to form microclusters, and the fact that these cannot readily enlarge into macroscopic crystals results in an (almost) amorphous state. For 0 x 20 the alloy series Pd 40 Ni (40-x) Fe x P 2 can be formed as BMGs with an unusually wide range of magnetic properties depending on composition and temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The physical properties of these amorphous alloys are clearly related to the possible existence and structure of such clusters or nanocrystals, with the magnetic properties related to the relative concentrations of the metallic elements in these regions. (ii) Co x Fe (80-x) B 20 : This range of alloys based on the classical ferromagnetic amorphous alloy, Fe 80 B 20 , has recently been used as the insulating component in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ's). These consist of ferromagnetic/insulating oxide/ferromagnetic trilayers -materials for which room temperature tunnelling magnetoresistance ratio (TMR) can be as high as 200% (and even possibly 400%). The ratio is greatest with crystalline components, but it is impossible to grow the correct Co or Fe orientations ((001) bcc Fe or Co) without an expensive single crystal substrate. However with amorphous CoFeB as the first layer it is possible to obtain high quality MgO with an (001) texture -after which annealing the complete trilayer gives top-ofthe-range TMR. Previous XRD and TEM studies indicate that the CoFeB layer induces crystallisation and lattice matching with MgO during annealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, there appears to be no previous studies on the bulk amorphous alloys themselves. We draw attention to the contrast between the two series in that for PdNiFeP we are trying to avoid crystallisation, whereas in tunnel junctions CoFeB is used to induce crystallisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Experiments were performed on melt spun ribbons of the two alloy series to monitor the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state. The specimens were mounted in the heating stage of a Displex temperature controller and heated from room temperature to 800K concentrating on regions above 500K. Both the Co x Fe (80-x) B 20 specimens were heated at a rate of 1.2K/min with spectra collected every 2K. Two of the three Pd 40 Ni (40-x) Fe x P 20 samples were heated at a rate of 0.6K/min with spectra collected every 1K, and the third at a rate 3K/min with data collection every 5K. Data sets were collected using the MAR CCD camera. Using the software ESA project <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> the images were integrated over the entire pixel range yielding intensity versus 2 as a function of temperature. From these scans it is possible to see the evolution of the crystalline phases with the increase in temperature for each sample.  Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows equivalent data for the Co x Fe (80-x) B 20 series. Both compositions have a sharp dominant peak at 2 ~ 36˚ forming at 632K. As both -Fe and CoFe solid solutions have (110) Bragg peaks at this position the confirmation of which phase is indicated by the data (if not both) requires that we identify other peaks associated with these phases. In a forthcoming run we intend to perform a much slower ramp collecting data at shorter time intervals, to focus on the formation of individual phases. Figure 2: recrystallisation images of Co x Fe (80-x) B 20 series (a) comparison of both compositions at the final temperature of 800K and, (b) the evolution of the crystalline phases in Co 60 Fe 20 B 20</p><p>For both alloy series the phases will be established using profile matching techniques. In a forthcoming extension of this work Rietveld Refinement software will be used to identify the chemical composition and structure of each. In the work outlined above beam refills meant that each of the samples underwent short temperature holds at arbitrary points during recrystallisation. This variation in heating profiles makes it difficult to assign changes in the crystallisation to either temperature or compositional changes, and in our next experiment we intend to collect data almost continuously every mK over a relatively narrow temperature range to avoid discontinuities during beam refills.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>• We have attained the heating profiles from RT to 800K of several compositions of two important series of amorphous alloys. • The first, Pd 40 Ni (40 -x) Fe x P 20 , is an alloy series with a wide range of magnetic properties that can be formed as a bulk metallic glass (BMG).</p><p>• The second, Co x Fe (80 -x) B 20 , was an addition to the original proposal as it has recently become a key ingredient in the crystallisation of magnetic tunnel junctions.</p><p>• Further work is still required on the nature and structure of enlarged clusters or nanocrystals that have a major influence on the physical properties of BMGs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1(a) shows the variation in 1D diffraction patterns at a constant temperature for samples of different composition. Bearing in mind that the Pd 40 Ni 30 Fe 10 P 20 composition was treated under a different heating profile than the other two, these images show that different phases are formed for each of the samples.Figure 1(b) shows the phase formation for Pd 40 Ni 22.5 Fe 17.5 P 20 as it is ramped from 600 to 800K. Each of the curves shows the formation of different sets of peaks suggesting that the recrystallisation is through multiple phases.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,274.92,316.44,132.60,133.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
