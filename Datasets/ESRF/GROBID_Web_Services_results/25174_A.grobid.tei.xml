<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Materials and methods: Samples from different types of organic soils and natural organic matter (NOM) from streams with Cu and Cd concentrations of 450 to 25 000 µg g -1 were prepared by addition of solutions of Cu and Cd salts to freeze-dried samples. The suspensions were allowed to evaporate to pastes with an approximate ionic strength of 10 mM NaNO 3 and pH was adjusted (4.6-6.6). The first 6 shifts were used to collected data at the Cu K-edge (8979 eV) and the last 12 shifts were used to collect data at the Cd K-edge (26711 eV), both in fluorescence mode. The two edge-energies were calibrated with Cu-foil and Ag-foils (25514 eV), respectively. At the Cu K-edge a 3µm Ni filter, and at the Cd K-edge a 3µm Ag filter, was placed between the sample and the Si-photodiode detector to reduce the scattering radiation. Samples were positioned at 45° to the incident beam. EXAFS data were collected at ambient atmospheric pressure and temperature. In all NOM samples the concentration of reduced S (thiol+organic sulphides and disulphides) was quantified using XANES, and in some cases by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</p><p>Results: The Cu data are not reported here since we had problems with raditaion damage in most of our samples. Changes in the pre-edge and edge region suggested that added Cu 2+ was reduced to Cu + . It is obviuos that with the high-flux at ID26 precautions such as cryogenic cooling need to be undertaken. After a problem with the second mirror had been resolved (it took 32 hours to reach reasonable calibration at the Cd K-edge), Cd data could be collected. Even if the the quality of data was not the best (c.f. Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), we collected information that made it possible to determine the binding environment of Cd in 4 carboxyl-and thiol cation-exchange resins (used as model compounds) and in 15 organic soil and NOM samples.</p><p>In the carboxyl resin Cd was coordinated by 4.8 O in the first atomic shell and 2.0 C in the second shell. The Cd-O bond length was 2.27 Å, consistent with 6-coordination. In the thiol resin at pH 8.8, Cd was coordinated by 3.1 Cd at 2.46 Å and 1.3 O at 2.28 Å. The bond length is indicative of a mixture of Cd in a trigonal, planar structure with S and 6-coordinated, hydrated Cd. In the second shell 2-3 C was encountered at 3.32 Å. When pH was decreased to 7.1 and 4.1 less S and more O was found in the first coordination shell of Cd in the thiol resins. Thus, Cd became more hydrated and less strongly bound to S. An increase in the Cd-S bond length to 2.52 Å suggests that Cd was 4-coordinated by S in the first shell at pH 7.1 and 4.1. The Cd-C bond length was maintained at 3.26-3.27 Å. At pH 8.8 80% of Cd was inner-sphere-associated with S and 20% was hydrated and at pH 4.1 60-70% of Cd was coordinated by S and 30-40% was hydrated.</p><p>In NOM samples from soils (pH 4.5 -7.1), S was only encountered in the first atomic shell at the lowest concentrations of Cd (450 -1000 ppm). A bond length of 2.43 -2.58 may imply a mixture of 3-, 4and 5-coordination. Given an uncertainty in bond length of approximately 0.03Å and a range of 2.47 -2.62 for Cd coordinated by 4 S in well-defined organic molecules (mainly proteins), we suggest that Cd was 4coordinated by S at the lowest loadings of Cd in both soil and aquatic NOM. The involvment of S was further supported by a longer Cd-C bond of 3.17 -3.24 Å, as compared to Cd bond lengths of 2.80 -3.19 Å in samples with only O in the first shell. In the sample with highest contribution from S, was 25% of Cd associated with S in an inner-sphere complexation and 75% was bound to O in the first atomic shell. Even if only 1 C was found in the second shell, data quality was not good enough to distinguish hydrated Cd from complexation by oxygen functional groups of NOM in this sample. In samples with less contribution from S, approximately 6 O was found in the first shell at a distance of 2.24-2.27 Å, strongly suggesting a 6coordination. In some NOM samples from soils 2-3 C was found in the second shell, indicating inner-sphere complexation with carboxyl and / or phenol groups. In NOM samples from aquatic environments 2.1 -8.0 C was found in the second shell, indicative of a predominant contribution from inner-sphere complexation by oxygen functional groups.</p><p>We can conclude from our results that sulfur groups undoubtly are involved in an inner-sphere complexation of Cd in NOM from soils, and likely from streams, at ambient concentrations of Cd (in most cases much lower than our smallest loading of 450 ppm). The sum of CN for O and S in the first shell indicates that even at 450 -1000 ppm some Cd was coordinated by 4 S (or 3 S and 1O), suggesting that there are reduced S groups available for such a coordination geometry even at quite high concentrations. Our results have implications for the transport and bioavailability of Cd in soils, sediments and streams. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>.
