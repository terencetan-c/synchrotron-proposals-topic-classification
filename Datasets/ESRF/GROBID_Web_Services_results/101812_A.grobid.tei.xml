<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Initially the plant was to measure the intermediates of the complex [Fe II (qpy)(H2O)2] 2+ , containing the ligand 2,2':6',2'':6'',2'''-quaterpyridine (qpy). However, we finally decided to focus our attention in a novel promising family of qpy-based Co-catalyst prepared in our laboratory (Chart 1). Among the new family of catalyst, the system functionalized with electron-donating groups, [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ is highly active towards CO2RR achieving currents of 0.7 mA, which triplicates that of the previously reported [Co II (qpy)(H2O)2] 2+ . With the objective of fully understanding the mechanism of Co(qpy)-mediated CO2 reduction to CO we decided of measure the best catalyst of this series, [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ , and use the X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) techniques, Kβ XES, high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD), and Valence-to-Core (VtC) XES to understand the electronic structure, geometry and coordination number of the steady-state intermediates of CO2RR. With this goal in mind, we prepared samples of the steady state intermediates of [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ at different oxidation states and scaled up the synthesis of the complex to perform operando measurements in solution.</p><p>Chart 1. Schematic drawing of the complexes discussed in this report.</p><p>Firstly, we analyzed the samples containing the [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ as a solid and in a solution of propylene carbonate containing 0.1 M of TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte and 3M of PhOH as proton source to clearly to define the starting point of the catalytic cycle. Interestingly, the measurements show a clear difference between both samples, which are in strong agreement with our electrochemical and X-ray diffraction studies. In case of the sample prepared in solution, a very weak pre-edge (1s-3d) feature suggest that the catalyst displays an octahedral geometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). This is consistent with the crystals obtained by slow diffusion of Et2O under the same conditions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>), which suggest that the species obtained in the crystallization media are the same than the dynamic complex in solution. However, the XANES spectrum of the powder shows completely different features, which can be explained by the fast ligand exchange observed in [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ that exchange the axial ligands with the solvent or traces of water in the media. In case of the complex in solution, it coordinates water molecules which are traces in the PhOH. However, when waters are no available it is prone to display a pseudo-octahedral geometry with a ClO4 -as a elongated bond/contact (ca. 2.24 A) in the axial position (See X-ray structures in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). DFT calculations will be carried out to simulate the spectra and fully characterize the electronic structure and geometry of [Co II (L2)(H2O)2] 2+ in solid state to understand its coordination sphere and geometry. Once the starting point of the catalytic cycle was clarified, we moved to the investigation of reactive intermediates. For this purpose, samples of 1 electron, 2 electron and 3 electron reduced species were prepared by applying the corresponding constant potential to a solution of [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ in propylene carbonate containing 0.1 M of TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte and 3M of PhOH as proton source under Ar atmosphere and in a two-compartment cell. In case of the 1 electron reduced species (2 in scheme 1) a solution was prepared with a concentration of 2 mM. However, a concentration of 0.5 mM was used for 2 electron and 3 electron reduced species (3 and 4 in scheme 1, respectively) due to the fast precipitation of the highly reduced intermediates at mentioned concentrations. Kβ XES, HERFD and Valence-to-Core XES were carried out for all the samples and the results are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>As can be observed in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the reduction of the initial complex (1) to the 1 electron reduce species (2) has a strong effect in the XANES and Kβ XES spectra. The most significant feature is the rise of a 1s to 3d preedge feature at ca. 7.71 KeV that suggest a change in the geometry around the metal center. Furthermore, another rising edge feature appears before the white line, both suggest that an axial ligand can decoordinate the metal center changing from octahedral to a square pyramidal geometry. This is in strong agreement with the DFT studies reported in the literature for the parent [Co II (qpy)(H2O)2] 2+ . i These studies, predicted the formation of an square planar intermediate after one electron reduction to the ligand, which is accompanied with a change in the electronic structure from high to low spin, which is strongly antiferromagnetically coupled. This change is also consistent with the Kβ XES spectrum, where a loss of the Kβ'' feature is observed, probably due to the strongly antiferromagnetically coupled unpaired electrons located at the ligand and metal center. Afterwards, the two electron reduced species was analyzed (3 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The XANES spectrum clearly shows the disappearance of the pre-edge feature, which suggest structural changes around the metal center to a more symmetric conformation. This is consistent with our DFT calculations that shows a favored change from square pyramidal to square planar geometry. Additionally, the edge feature looks shifted to lower energies that could indicate a change in the oxidation state of the metal center from CoII to CoI. Finally, the 3 electron reduced species intermediate (4) was investigated. This intermediate is the responsible to trigger the catalysis and therefore the one that governs the catalytic performance of [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+</p><p>.It is worth mentioning that the isolation of 4 is only possible under Ar conditions and in the total absence of PhOH, which in the absence of CO2 favors the catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The XANES spectra does not show a shift in the edge, which suggest that the oxidation state of the metal center could remain unaltered, and therefore it could suggest that a second reduction in the ligand triggers the catalysis. In order to get more information, the spectra obtained for 4 will be compared with other experiments, such as EPR, UV-vis and NMR (expected S=0) and other techniques to propose the structure of the key intermediate.  Additionally, VtC XES spectra of 1-4 were recorded to further probe the electronic structure of the intermediates. The results are displayed in the Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, and we should compare them with DFT calculations before getting conclusions. VtC XES experiments will help to follow changes in the first coordination sphere and differentiate between CO2 or CO coordinating the metal center in the intermediates 1-4.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Additionally, the electronic structure of the proposed resting state of the catalysis was investigated by preparing a sample during the catalytic experiment at t= 2h. Comparison of the XANES spectrum with 1, displayed in the Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, shows that the species that remains as resting state of the catalysis is the one-electron reduced species, which is in strong agreement with our catalytic proposal displayed in Scheme 1. Moreover, the stability of the system was checked. For this purpose, the species in solution were reduced again to the initial compound [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ (1) and the XANES and Kβ XES spectra were compared. The comparison show the same spectra for [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ before and after the catalytic process, which demonstrates the robustness of our catalyst and dismiss the degradation to metallic cobalt-based nanomaterials.</p><p>Finally, we attempted to carry out operando measurements in solution. For this purpose, a custom-made spectroelectrochemical (SEC) flow-cell was be used. The SEC cell uses a glassy carbon plate (2 x 1 cm and 180 μm thick) as working electrode. A solution of [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ was bubbled with CO2 and pumped through the cell filling the compartment. A potentiostat was used to keep a constant pontential from -0.95 to -0.90 V at the catalytic wave and a constant flow of 40-100 uL/min was used. Unfortunately, we found that operando measurements in homogeneous conditions were not possible due to the fluctuations on the concentration provoked by the formation of CO bubbles. This strongly affects the accumulation of scans in the detector, which is translated in spikes and variations between recorded spectra. After measuring 100 scans for the XANES spectrum, only 15 were usable. However, we could not collect the Kβ and VtC XES due to this reason. To overcome this challenge, we propose two alternative experiments for the future. On the one hand, we can use a cryostream to freeze the homogeneous spectro-electrochemical cell during catalysis, and measure the frozen solution. Alternatively, a prepared analog of [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ contaning pyrene groups, [Co II (QPYPyn)(Cl)2], can be anchored to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through π-π interactions and measured under operando conditions. In order to take advantage of the time, we installed the cryostat again and we measured [Co II (L1)(H2O)2] 2+ in acetonitrile as solvent to compare and prove that the experiments performed in propylene carbonate and the same that the ones performed in MeCN (where the catalysis takes place). All these conclusions are preliminary and they should be compared with EPR, UV-vis and electrochemical measurements performed at MPI. Moreover, all the structures and intermediates reported here will be optimized and their spectra will be simulated by DFT calculations.</p></div>			</div>
