<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment report:</head><p>Photo-control of the magnetic properties is an emerging field that would open the way to novel materials functionalities with potential applications in opto-electronics (optical memories, optical isolators…) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3]</ref>. For a more fundamental point of view, it offers the possibility to control magnetic dilution, e.g. by combination of photo-excitation and thermal relaxation. Of particular interest are Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) which have already provided a wealth of attractive results: high-T C magnet, photo-induced ferrimagnetism <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, photocontrolled pole inversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, photo-and thermo-chromism, magnetisation-induced second harmonic generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>… Cobalt hexacyanoferrates, A x Co 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] (x+8)/3 .zH 2 O, exhibit a charge transfer-induced spin state transition (CTISST) as a function of temperature or, at low temperature (&lt; 160K), under red light irradiation. Photo-efficiency depends on several factors related to the chemical environment, namely the amount of Co III (LS)-Fe II (LS) diamagnetic pairs # , leading to Co II (HS)-Fe III (LS) magnetic pairs by optical electron transfer, and the lattice flexibility. The latter factor is primarily due to the presence of [Fe(CN) 6 ] vacancies but also to the size of the alkali metal counter ion, A.</p><p># LS= low spin, HS= high spin</p><p>We have recently undertaken a thorough investigation of the equilibrium and photo-induced properties of various cobalt hexacyanoferrates. In particular, owing the ease in trapping the high temperature (HT) phase by rapid cooling, we have compared the properties of the quenched HT phase with those of the photo-excited phase in terms of magnetic behaviour, thermal decay and relaxation mechanism. We have evidenced a depressed Curie temperature for the quenched state, in addition with a higher decay temperature and a slower relaxation at short times <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4]</ref>. Up to now, it was conjectured that the high temperature stable state and the photoinduced metastable state present a same electronic fine structure, as exemplified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[5]</ref>.</p><p>We thought that such differences might originate from subtle structural changes that were very little studied according to the literature. Only recent low-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction experiments performed on the BL02B2 workstation (Spring8, Japan) on a Na 0.42 Co[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.78 sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref> suggested a strongly reduced structural coherence length and a decreased lattice parameter for the quenched phase with respect to the photo-excited phase. However, both effects could also be interpreted as due to a partial relaxation of the quenched state (ca. 40%) leading to rather small nuclei of the low temperature (LT) stable state (a-cubic parameter~ 10.00Å) in a matrix which lattice constant has an average value of 10.19Å inbetween those of the LT and HT (a~ 10.30Å) phases. EXAFS measurements on a caesium analogue have also evidenced a change in the Co-NC-Fe arrangement upon cooling, from bended to linear, which was attributed to a displacement of the large Cs ions within the tetrahedral sites of the fcc structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. However, this latter result is deduced from measurements at the Cs L 3 -edge, so that this distortion might be local and not coherent within the crystal. Note that those structural changes would be of particular importance since the magnetic interactions proceed via superexchange coupling through the cyanide bridges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First results:</head><p>The samples which were studied were provided by the group of K. Hashimoto and S. Ohkoshi (RCAST, University of Tokyo, Japan) and the group of A. Bleuzen (LCIMM, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, France). The powder diffraction experiments were performed on BM01a using the fast data acquisition capabilities of the image plate set-up. The wavelength was tuned to 0.82Å to be comparable to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>. Both static and dynamic structural changes were followed in the (i) stable, (ii) photo-excited and (iii) HT quenched states. Comparison was made with reference compounds, namely Co 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2 .14H 2 O and Rb 0.45 Co[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.83 .3.3H 2 O, which retain the HT and LT structures respectively, over the whole temperature range (10K-300K).</p><p>1. for the alkali-free reference sample Co 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2 .14H 2 O showing no spin transition, we have observed a large thermal expansion indicative of a soft crystal structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) together with a slight anisotropic line broadening that could be ascribed to micro-strains or to an unresolved structural distortion. Using an empirical model of uniaxial strain along the 111 direction, we could reproduce the various line shapes. This anisotropic broadening is partly suppressed when the temperature decreases. However, the fact that the intensity of the narrowest (h00) lines also decreases might better reflect an increased lattice distortion (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Further studies, including high resolution powder diffraction measurements, are clearly needed to understand the peculiar temperature dependence observed for this sample. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig.1b</head><p>Relative intensity as a function of temperature for the (400), ( <ref type="formula">422</ref>) and (333) lines, assuming a fcc crystal structure.</p><p>On the contrary, the thermal dependence for Rb 0.45 Co[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.83 .3.3H 2 O is consistent with a harder structure with a contraction of ca. 0.008Å on the temperature range studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>For the alkali-doped sample Na 0.32 Co[Fe(CN) 6 ] 0.74 .3.4H 2 O showing a discontinuous spin transition, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the diffraction patterns recorded: (i) at 300K, (ii) after slow cooling at 110K and (iii) after subsequent photo-excitation at 110K. Irradiation was carried out with a laser diode (collimated beam of ca. 1mm in diameter, λ= 690nm, power: 20mWatt). The residual LT phase after irradiation might be attributed to: (i) a slight misalignment of the laser with the part of the sample probed by the X-ray beam or else to (ii) bulk absorption effects that limits the penetration depth of the red light despite of the rather small sample thickness (0.1mmØ capillary). Both HT and LT phases could be indexed using the same Fm3m structural model. The LT phase is characterised by a large volume contraction (∼90Å 3 per fcc unit cell) preliminary due to the Co-N bond shortening (~0.18Å from EXAFS studies) which accompanies the Co II (HS)→Co III (LS) electron transfer. Large (and reversible) "strain" effects are evident in the LT phase. Its slightly asymetric line shape could account for a residual Co II fraction (Co/Fe ratio larger than 1 in the sample studied) and as-related displacement disorder effects. Nevertheless, the large peak broadening at low temperature is probably not only due to strains. Indeed, despite of the rather low instrumental resolution, a small peak splitting has been observed for the (600)+(442) line.</p><p>As expected, irradiation gives rise to a new phase with an increased lattice parameter value (due to the spin transition). The striking result is the strong anisotropic peak broadening apparent for the photo-excited phase, which results from some kind of "strain release" along the &lt;h00&gt; directions (see for instance the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Such narrowing of the (h00) lines is similar to the case study of the alkali-free sample, but the effect is much larger. Again high-resolution diffraction data would help understanding the origin of this anisotropic line shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Comparison between quenched and photo-excited states.</head><p>The present experiments allow to draw more definite conclusions compared to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>. Indeed, the decrease in lattice parameter and the peak broadening reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref> for the quenched phase must be ascribed to an uncomplete quenching procedure. For an efficient trapping, one needs to minimize the temperature interval between the thermal decay of the metastable state and the cooling branch of the thermal hysteresis loop. It is hence strongly dependent on the sample composition. This criterium was fullfilled for the sample studied [see 8 for instance] and only a small peak broadening could be observed, after quenching. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show the comparison between the diffraction patterns measured at 110K for the photo-excited phase, the HT quenched phase and the reference compound Co II 3 [Fe III (CN) 6 ] 2 . The two latter profiles are comparable, while the photo-excited phase shows a larger lattice parameter. More detailed analyses are in progress. However, both the larger lattice parameter value and the larger strain effects observed for the photo-excited phase are in apparent contradiction with the larger Curie temperature compared to that of the quenched phase.</p><p>Relaxation measurements performed as a function of temperature (or time at a given temperature) confirmed that the decay of the HT quenched phase occurs at higher temperature, and hence implies a larger barrier energy. In addition, shifts and broadenings of the diffraction peaks seem to show that the relaxation proceeds inhomogeneously throughout the sample, either via spinodal decomposition or because of a distribution of barrier energies. Such a distribution has already been invoked and estimated through the analyses of relaxation curves obtained from macroscopic magnetic susceptibility data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Yet such a distribution should be associated with the presence of point defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Not only the [Fe(CN) 6 ] vacancies but also the alkali metal ions could participate to the building up of such distributions as claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. New structural analyses, for different sample compositions (nature and concentration of alkali metal), will be performed (exp. HE1956).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1a</head><label>1a</label><figDesc>Fig.1a Cubic lattice parameter as a function of temperature for Co 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2 .14H 2 O.</figDesc></figure>
