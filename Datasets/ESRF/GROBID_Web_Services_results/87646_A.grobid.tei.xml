<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results</head><p>We have developed a single-ion conductor solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), in contrast to conventional binary conductor SPE, stable up to 5 V that showed excellent performances between 60 and 80 °C when used as separator and positive electrode binder in lithium (Li) metal batteries comprising LiFePO 4 (LFP) as active material. LFP, a reference material, operates at about 3.4 V for a specific capacity of 170 mAh.g -1 . Replacing LFP by a higher voltage material such as LiMn 0.6 Fe 0.4 PO 4 (LMFP) in which Li + is inserted/de-inserted at 3.4 V (Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ) and at 4.1 V (Mn 2+ /Mn 3+ ) is a way to increase the energy density.</p><p>The main goal of the MA-3966 proposal is to finely study the behavior of the LMFP material in an allsolid-state Li/LMFP battery comprising a single-ion or binary conductor SPE at a temperature of 80 °C. To follow LMFP structural changes (electrochemical process, reversibility) wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) is performed during battery cycling (operando characterization). This technique permits to observe and quantify the evolution of the material structure during each charge/discharge cycle. In addition, the kinetic of the electrochemical reactions will be followed along the positive electrode thickness (from its current collector to the SPE layer) by WAXS analysis. The secondary goal of the proposal is to design new small-size electrochemical cells specifically adapted to the ID31 beamline with cycling signature similar to regular lab-scale cells (coin and pouch cells). This versatile cell should ultimately allow to perform both Xray diffraction (SAXS, WAXS...) and tomography (absorption, diffraction...) experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental work</head><p>Prior beamtime two types of electrochemical cells were designed, assembled in argon filled glove box, tested, and optimized through a collaboration between LEPMI, ID31, and Sample Environment Support Laboratory (SESL, Yves Watier). These air-tight cells have a casing made of plastic (polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) or glass with stainless steel pistons for electrical contact. Both are able to cycle small-size battery (3 mm active diameter) up to 80 °C with electrochemical signature similar to that of coin or pouch cells.</p><p>During beamtime, the experiments were carried out at ID31 in its WAXS configuration using a Pilatus 2M CdTe detector coupled to an incident X-ray beam of 70 keV in transmission mode. The PTFE and glass cells were held at 80°C using gas blowers and a specifically home-made heating element by SESL, respectively. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are pictures of the cells when connected to a potentiostat and ready to be cycled while being X-ray illuminated. For each battery, the experimental setup consists in cycling at a low regime (~ 10 h per charge or discharge) while collecting WAXS patterns of the entire cell by a z-scan from one electrode to the other in 5 µm slice step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study 1. Comparison of PTFE and glass cell</head><p>The two electrochemical cells made of PTFE and glass were cycled at 80°C while analyzed by WAXS. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> represents the potential as a function of the capacity of batteries comprising a Li negative electrode, a binary conductor SPE and a LiFePO 4 based positive electrodes during a charge step. The cycling profiles are similar with a plateau at about 3.55 V corresponding to the oxidation of LiFePO 4 in FePO 4 . The inset of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the WAXS profile, relative intensity versus the Bragg 2θ angle, of both cells at a capacity of 0.6 mAh.cm -2, (about at the half of the LFP plateau). The peak positions are similar for both cells whereas peaks are much better defined (intensity relative to the background, full width at half maximum) for the glass rather than the PTFE cell. In addition, initial analysis of the electrochemical process is consistent with literature data in which the transition of LiFePO 4 into FePO 4 is driven by a non-ideal biphasic mechanism. Furthermore, we are still processing the data to follow the reaction kinetic through the positive electrode thickness. Preliminary results show that LFP is reacting from the SPE side to the positive electrode current collector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">LMFP battery comprising a single-ion conductor polymer electrolyte</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a representative cycling profile of a battery in a PTFE cell comprising a single-ion conductor SPE in between a Li metal and a LMFP based positive electrode. We successfully cycled three times this battery at the beamline. Two plateaus per charge or discharge steps are distinguishable with a battery performance similar to that obtained at the LEPMI laboratory. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the WAXS profile recorded at one of the potential vs. time data point in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, in which all the battery layers are clearly resolved from the Li part to the positive current collector. Analyses are under ways to track the LMFP phase transition all along the electrode thickness and along the different cycling steps. Data has also been recorded on battery replicates as well as for Li/LMFP battery comprising a binary conductor SPE for comparison. Figure 1.
