<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>Instead of using a micro-beam as it was previously done for the study of the alteration of vermilion experimental set-up was based on an existing project of full be applied at the Hg-L 3 edge to our type of samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1 : Full-field XANES setup principl</head><p>After assessing the best parameters to perform these analyses (bender, slits, acquisition conditions…), we performed transmission mappings on model samples. Different thicknesses of cross-section were tested to establish a protocol for the sample preparation, and we focused on samples with several layers of mercury compounds with different states of oxidation (Hg[II]S/Hg[II]SO 4 /Hg[I] 2 Cl 2 /Hg[II]Cl 2 ) to assess the possibility to differentiate these compounds, in full 2D mode. Then, samples artificially aged were tested to obtain XANES and EXAFS spectra on pigment and degraded layers. Finally, original altered samples coming from a fresco of the Monastery of Pedralbes (Spain) were analyzed. These samples were previously analyzed by other techniques 1,3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Apart from technical problems that should be fixed for future measurements (the sample was moving during the analysis and the beam structure is not well corrected with the flat-field acquisition), the image quality was quite good. From these images we extracted sum spectra corresponding to specific areas and comparable to the ones of references analyzed before. The XANES parts of the spectra were smooth enough to be able to see the energy of the white line, but the EXAFS parts were too noisy to have interpretable oscillations. It appeared that the flux at BM23 was unsufficient for such an EXAFS approach, and therefore, the data analyses were focussed on the XANES region. It also appeared that beam variation with time is a real issue. Therefore, for future experiments, it would be better to consider the acquisition of multiple short scans, instead of the acquisition of a single long scan. On the model samples, it was possible to differentiate spectra of sulfides (α-HgS) and sulfates (HgSO 4 ) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Sample preparation appeared as a limiting factor. Different thicknesses had been prepared in order to choose the best one. However, heterogeneity of the density, granulometry and therefore absorption made this choice difficult (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>: HgS is poorly absorbing while HgSO 4 is almost completely absorbing X-rays). On the artificially aged samples, the degraded layers were not concentrated enough to be able to identify the compound present. On the original samples, only vermilion (α-HgS) was clearly detected. Multiple consecutive spectra were acquired to see if the analyses induced a degradation, but no difference was observed between them. The analysis of data has still to be improved to have a better normalisation and correct the heterogeneity of the beam. With this improvement we hope to obtain more information on the original samples from the data acquired during this experiment. b) d) c) HgSO 4 HgS HgSO 4 HgS a) Hg 2 Cl 2</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France, UMR 171 CNRS, Paris, France (b) University of Antwerp, Department of Chemistry, Antwerp, Belgium (c) ESRF, Grenoble, France (d) Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, UMR 8602 CNRS, Paris, France</figDesc></figure>
