<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The target of the research project for which the experiment at BM26 was performed is to create a new family of block copolymers consisting of a supramolecular block. Such copolymers, termed quasi-block copolymers (q-BCPs), should feature both the microphase separation-induced nano-structuration typical to block copolymers and the ability to tune the molecular weight of the supramolecular block using external stimuli.</p><p>The aim of the experiment at BM26 was to construct the phase diagrams of these copolymers both in solution and in the melt. Nearly 150 samples were prepared in capillaries and on kapton sheets and brought to ESRF for the experiment. Preliminary experiments performed prior to the experiment provided encouraging evidence for the formation of the q-BCP architectures. In solution, viscosity measurements performed on mixtures of the supramolecular polymer (EHUT) and end-functionalized polystyrene (either PS-DiBUT or PS-TriBUT) showed a much slower increase in viscosity with increasing EHUT concentrations compared to a mixture of EHUT and a "dead" PS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In the solid state, differential scanning calorimetry measurements (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and surface probe microscopy images indicated the formation of microphase separated structures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).  x=1 None of the solution samples scattered X-rays at low angles despite our expectations that micelles will be formed, and despite the indirect evidence from viscometry demonstrating that q-BCP structures are formed in these solutions. The conclusion is that the conditions used for the solution samples (i.e., concentrations and solvent systems) were below the critical micelle concentration, and further studies are required to identify the appropriate conditions for micelle formation.</p><p>Melt samples also did not exhibit diffraction peaks at low angles, indicating that the phase separated structures observed by SPM were not sufficiently uniform in size. Nonetheless, poly(EHUT) features a peak at the wide angle region of the SAXS, which is attributed to the crystallization of the supramolecular polymer. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows that a similar peak was observed only in the control experiment, consisting of the "dead" PS polymer blended with EHUT. The absence of this peak in the PS-DiBUT and PS-TriBUT consisting samples indirectly indicates the formation of smaller domains of poly(EHUT), which is in line with the DSC and SPM data presented above. Spare time we had during the experiment was used for acquiring data on additional samples we brought, related to a different project (formation of hierarchical structures in block copolymer/organometallic surfactant systems). The results we obtained complemented data acquired during a previous experiment at ESRF, and were required for completing our understanding on the behavior of these systems. We are currently preparing this material for publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
