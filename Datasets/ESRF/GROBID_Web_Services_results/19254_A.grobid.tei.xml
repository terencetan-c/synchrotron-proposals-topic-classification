<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Pt, Rh and Pd carbonyl complexes were successfully synthesized inside the cavities of zeolites by the "ship-in-bottle" synthesis. Their decomposition leads to uniform metallic particles homogeneously dispersed over the zeolite support. The carbonyl complexes and bare metallic particles are active in a variety of reactions, mainly in CO+NO conversion, water gas shift reaction and naphtha reforming. The aim of this study is to determine the structure of bimetallic PtRh carbonyl complexes prepared by the ship-in-bottle technique.</p><p>The presence of Pt-Rh bonds in bimetallic particles can be proved by the coexistence of Pt-Pt and Pt-Rh shells in Pt L III edge, as well as Rh-Pt and Rh-Rh shells in Rh K edge EXAFS spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Rh K and Pt L III edge EXAFS spectra were recorded in transmission mode at liquid nitrogen temperature. The data were analyzed by standard procedures using the XAFS Data Analysis Program XDAP -Version 2.2.3.</p><p>The complexes were prepared by carbonylation of [Rh(NH 3 ) 5 Cl] 2+ and [Pt(NH 3 ) 4 ] 2+ ions exchanged into zeolite NaX.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rh edge EXAFS spectra</head><p>The first sample was carbonylated for 14 hours and the Fourier transformed spectrum is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The spectrum was fitted by one Rh-Rh shell and the interatomic distance of 2.79 Å is significantly longer than the one observed for pure metal (2.68 Å). The very low coordination number 2.6 points to the formation of very small Rh clusters. It can be concluded that no bimetallic particles are formed because it was impossible to fit the spectrum with Rh-Rh and Rh-Pt shells together.</p><p>The second sample was carbonylated for 80 hours and the Fourier transformed spectrum is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The best model to fit the spectrum consists of one Rh-Rh and one Rh-Pt shell. The Rh-Rh interatomic distance was again 2.79 Å and the Rh-Pt distance was found at 2.65 Å. The very low coordination numbers show that very small bimetallic clusters are formed and that a longer time of carbonylation is required to form bimetallic particles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pt edge EXAFS spectrum</head><p>The Fourier transformed spectrum of the sample carbonylated during 80 hours is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The peak between 2 and 3 Å can correspond to Pt-Pt as well as Pt-Rh shells. Pt-C and possibly also Pt-O shells were detected in the range of 1 to 2 Å. Further data analysis of Pt edge spectra is in progress.
