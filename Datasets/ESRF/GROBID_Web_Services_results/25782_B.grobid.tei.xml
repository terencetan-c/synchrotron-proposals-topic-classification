<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The samples were in 0.3 or 0.5 mm boron-glass capillaries. The wavelength was 0.49956 Å.</p><p>The analyses of most of the data are not finished at the moment, but some preliminary results are given here.</p><p>NaAlH 4 and LiAlD 4 samples:</p><p>We did more detailed follow-up studies of two earlier publications based on data from SNBL.</p><p>The main idea is to find how the additives work in alanates; they clearly improve the kinetics, but there is now information of the chemical state of the additive. By adding e.g. TiCl 3 to NaAlH 4 , from the presence of NaCl and Al in the sample afterwards there has been a reaction between the additive and NaAlH 4 , but no traces of any Ti containing phase or any solidsolution of Ti in the NaAlH 4 phase.</p><p>At this experiment we tried with higher additive concentration in the search for Ti, in particular in the cycled samples of NaAlH 4 . Again, no Ti compound was seen directly after ball milling. On the other hand, evidencies of an Al-Ti phase after cycling was seen more clearly with 10 mol% compared to 2 mol% of Ti additive.</p><p>For LiAlD 4 we also tried with larger VCl 3 amounts added by ball milling, and we are here able to observe some unreacted VCl 3 , but no other vanadium-containing phases were seen after ball milling. Samples heated to 270°C furthermore do not show any traces of vanadiumeven with 15 mol% VCl 3 in the original sample.</p><p>Samples with additives added to Li 3 AlD 6 (and measured at SNBL) are also under investigation.</p><p>LiAlD 4 with TiF 3 additives react completely during ball milling with no traces of neither Ti nor F. NaF was expected with analogy to the findings of NaCl in the VCl 3 doped samples. The samples are not stable towards desorption in glove box, evidenced by samples which contained LiAlD 4 + Li 3 AlD 6 + Al six months before, now were nearly completely desorbed to LiD + Al.</p><p>In the figure below, LiAlD 4 + 2 mol% TiF 3 which has been stored for 5 months, containing Al, LiD, Li 3 AlD 6 and trace amounts of LiCl (from impurities in LiAlD 4 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Mg(AlH 4 ) 2</formula><p>Data were collected at both room temperature and 110 K (using nitrogen cooler). These data are used in combination with powder neutron diffraction data, and a publication will be submitted within a few weeks.</p><p>ZrCr 2 D 4</p><p>This system has been studied by powder neutron diffraction focusing on determination of local order. However, data below about 200K shows ordering, and there are some indications that the previously published structure is not correct. The SNBL-data at 110K will be used to clarify this point. Refinements are in progress.</p><p>Zr 2 NiD 4.7</p><p>We have worked intense on this system for a long time. The saturated hydride, Zr 2 NiD 4.7 shows several superstructure reflections indicating lowered symmetry. However, it has until now been impossible to determine the correct unit cell and space group. The purpose of this experiment was to collect data with extremely good statistics to find even very weak superstructure reflections. In particular reflections at low angles are important. The analysis of the data is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BaMgNiD 4</head><p>This is a new interesting Mg-based complex hydride. Powder neutron diffraction data suggest lowering of the symmetry compared to standard X-ray data, but the possible splitting of reflections are very weak. High-resolution synchrotron data are therefore required to sort out this problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>B. C. Hauback, H. W. Brinks, D.
