<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of experiment 30-02-1136 was to determine the density of H2O-CO2-NaCl fluids at crustal conditions by the Xray absorption technique in the FAME autoclave (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). Fluids in this ternary sytem are a good approximation for most fluids encountared in a broad range of geological settings, including geothermal wells, hydrothermal venting systems in the seafloor and a variety of hydrothermal ore deposits. Despite their relevance, their density and PVTx properties remain poorly constrained at pressures above 0.1 kbar.</p><p>During the allocated beamtime, we determined the density of binary H2O-NaCl and H2O-CO2 fluids up to to 1 kbar and 500 C, thus extending by one order the magnitude in pressure the available density data set in H2O-CO2 fluids. A total of 18 runs were conducted in binary fluids with salinities of 1 to 4 mol/kg H2O and molar fractions of CO2, XCO2, from 0.04 to 0.14. The experiments were conducted using glassy carbon X-ray tranparent inner cells. The saline fluids were freshly prepared from high purity NaCl powder and distilled H2O. H2O-CO2 fluids with different XCO2 were prepared by thermal decomposition of oxalic acid dihydrate, H2C2O4.2H2O, in excess H2O in the inner cell of the autoclave (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</p><p>The density of the fluids was obtained from the measured X-ray absorption signals using the by the Beer-Lambert law:</p><p>where I0 and I1, are respectively the intensity of the incident and transmitted X-ray beam through the sample. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref> displays the absorbance measured in the sample enclosed in the autoclave (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>) and the contributions from the different parts of the assembly (e.g. inner cell or He pressure medium). The mass absorption coefficient of the material (μ/ρ) is an additive function of composition, but independent of pressure and temperature, thus the density at high P-T, PT, is obtained as: μ0/ρ0=μPT/PT, where the ratio (μ0/ρ0) at a reference P-T is calculated from density models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Driesner, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Duan et al., 2008)</ref> and compilations of atomic parameters available in the literature.</p><p>The technique was validated by experiments conducted in H2O-NaCl fluids, where densities over a broad range of P-T conditions are available. The results for different P-T and salinities are reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>. The agreement with the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Driesner (2007)</ref> is excellent for most of the conditions, with the exception of the highest temperature data points which likely reflect the onset of phase separation in the system.</p><p>The results from measurments in the H2O-CO2 system up to 400 C and 0.8 kbar are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref> together with literature data. Our densities are systematically lower than densities from vibrating tube densitometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Seitz and Blencoe, 1999)</ref>, although the deviation decreases upon increasing pressure, being smaller than 4% at 0.8 kbar. The origin of this discrepancy might be the formation of CO in the fluid due to the incomplete loss of H2 from the high pressure cell as confirmed on complementary Raman studies in the autoclave at run conditions conducted in the laboratory after the synchrotron experiments. We have thus conducted exploratory experiments in the autoclave using silver oxalate, Ag2C2O4,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x I I             1 0 ln</formula><p>as CO2 source and the absence of CO in the resulting fluid was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. This observation holds promise for successful density measurements in the H2O-CO2 and H2O-CO2-NaCl systems in future synchrotron campaigns.</p><p>The present experiments demonstrate that the X-ray absorption technique combined with the FAME auclave is well suited to derive the density of hydrothermal fluids at P-T up to 2 kbar and 500 C, covering the pressure gap between other techniques such an the vibrating tube densimetry (&lt; 0.5 kbar) and the hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (&gt; 5 kbar). The preliminary results have been presented as an oral communication at the Fall AGU 2018 meeting in Washington D.C. (USA). A technical paper describing and validating the experimental approach is currently in preparation and will be submitted in Spring 2020. After identifying and solving the technical drawbacks that limited the success of the previous experiments, we plan to apply for additional beamtime to complete the studies in the H2O-CO2 and H2O-CO2-NaCl system. The expected results will provide the first PVTx model for binary and ternary CO2-bearing fluids that are ubiquitous in the Earth's crust.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Density of H 2 O-CO 2 -NaCl fluids at crustal conditions and controls on the formation of ore deposits s): Jean-Louis Hazemann Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Carmen Sanchez-Valle*, Institute for Mineralogy, University of Münster, Germany Marion Louvel*, Institute for Mineralogy, University of Münster, Germany Christina Springklee*, Institute for Mineralogy, University of Münster, Germany</figDesc></figure>
