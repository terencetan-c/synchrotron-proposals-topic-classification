If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. In our previous work, we presented a new catalytic system for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde using a heterogeneous iridium-based catalyst. For this purpose, a covalent triazine framework based on bipyridine building blocks (bipy-CTF) offering enhanced porosity, functionality and stability was applied as an ideal catalyst support. EXAFS analysis was performed to determine at which site the Ir complex binds to the bipy-CTF material. Two potential sites can be differentiated: a) complexation with two N atoms of a singular bipyridine moeity and b) complexation with a N atom of the bipyridine functional group and a N of the triazine component. It was found that for the complex before and after catalysis, the Ir III Cp*Cl@bipy-CTF is characterized by an Ir-N bond distances of 2.11 Å (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This experimentally determined bond distance is in agreement with the theoretically calculated distances of the Ir complexation to the bipyridine moeity (2.131 Å), where the bonding to both a bipyridine and triazine N is sterically hindered. As such, both methods clearly proves that the Ir complex is bound onto the N atoms of the bipyridine sites.</p><p>The catalytic mechanism of the heterogeneous Ir III Cp*Cl@bipy-CTF catalyst was examined by employing In Situ XANES. Based on the obtained results and previous reports on homogeneous Ir-based catalysts, a plausible mechanistic pathway for the present aerobic oxidation reaction, involving an Ir I /Ir III cycle, is depicted in Scheme 1. As the catalytic reaction proceeds, a shift in the local Ir structure was perceived from the Ir III @bipy-CTF state to an Ir I @bipy-CTF state (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This transition in Ir oxidation state can be understood from Scheme 1 as during the in situ studies a limiting amount of benzyl alcohol was present, which is necessary to regenerate the Ir I compound back to the catalytically active Ir III compound. When all benzyl alcohol is gone from the reaction cell, the Ir complex will be stuck in an Ir I state. It was observed that this state was immediately regenerated to Ir III after additional addition of benzyl alcohol, which is in line with the cyclical nature of the reaction scheme.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

The amplitude reduction factor S 0 ² was set to 0.9. DW and N were set as fixed parameters.
