<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A system to allow in-situ GISAXS during slot-die coating (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) of waterborne coatings was successfully tested during this beamtime at BM26B. The great performances of the beamline allowed high quality data to be acquired with second time resolutions.

One of the successful experiments is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We will use these preliminary results as the basis for an upcoming proposal on in-situ. Part of this beamtime was also dedicated to a full investigation of ex-situ depth resolved analysis. These static results are necessary to be acquired in preparation to a successful in-sittu study. We have published these results in the following manuscript. Abstract is also attached. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Soft polymer colloidal water suspensions are extremely important formulations for industrial applications such as water-based environmental-friendly coatings, paints, and adhesives. Homogeneity of the final coating at the micrometer and nanoscale is a crucial factor for optimal coating performance, such as barrier properties against solvent permeation. Here, we investigated the remnant nanostructure in slot-die-coated micrometersized thick clear coating films (clearcoats) of three different waterborne polymer colloids (pure soft, pure hard, and soft/hard multiphase), commonly utilized as primers in paint formulations <ref type="bibr">[Mader et al. Prog. Org. Coat.2011, 71, 123-135]</ref>, using variable-angle grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) complemented with cross-sectional atomic force microscopy (cs-AFM). After complete macroscopic drying, the coating films exhibit the presence of residual nanostructure with characteristic distance (d*) smaller than the original particle size and even smaller (≪d*) heterogeneity dimensions. These nanostructural heterogeneities (i) develop due to partial particle coalescence, (ii) are preferentially located close to the airfilm interface and (iii) demonstrate the tendency to align perpendicular to the air-film interface, implying vertical gradient in hydroplasticization effects having occurred earlier during film formation. The extent and size of the nanostructural heterogeneities, driven by the slot-die coating application, strongly depend on the polymer chemistry (glass transition temperature, Tg) and the colloidal architecture. Last, solvent exposure has a significant impact on the nanostructure, causing the removal of these heterogeneities and leading to a more strongly coalesced film. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
