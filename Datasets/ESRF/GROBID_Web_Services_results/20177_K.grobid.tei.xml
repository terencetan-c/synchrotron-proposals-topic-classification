<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have continued diffraction studies on an E. coli iron transporter (an integral outer membrane protein). A native data set to 2.3 Å resolution has previously been collected on ID29 in Feb. 2001. This time 2 more native data sets are collected from frozen crystals of the same conditions. They diffracted to 2.1 Å and 3.0 Å resolution. Images were indexed with Mosflm, and scaled with SCALA, and found to have the symmetry of space group P2 1 2 1 2 as before, with similar unit cell constants a=117.4, b=89.6, c=96.0 Å. Estimation of V M indicates that the asymmetric unit contains one transporter, corresponding to a solvent content of 58.9%.</p><p>Solution of the structure by molecular replacement so far using the crystal structures of two distantly-related iron transporters in E. coli (~ 18% sequence identity) has not been successful. The selenomethione derivative of the protein has been produced to pursue MAD experiments. Crystals have been obtained, which were subject to preliminary diffraction analysis in this trip. They diffracted to 3.8 Å resolution, but the anisotropic nature of the diffraction and the very high mosaicity have made indexing and processing difficult. Improvement on the Semet crystal quality is necessary.</p><p>For the second E.coli outer membrane transporter, preliminary diffraction of the selenomethionyl derivative was performed on beamline ID29, which diffracted to 8Å resolution. Currently we are working on improving the diffraction properties of the crystals.</p></div>			</div>
