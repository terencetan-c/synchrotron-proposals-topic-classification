<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In ZIF-8 at 185 K 4 different positions of adsorbed Xe atoms were found. Xe1 at position (x,x,z), coordinated to the immidazole organic ligand and was the major position of Xe adsorption. Xe2 at position (x,0,0), coordinated to the CH 3 group, and Xe3 at position (x,x,x), coordinated to the opening window of the large pore, have a fractional occupancy of 5-25% up to a pressure of 100 mbar. Increasing pressure up to 400 mbar decreased the occupancies of Xe2(x,0,0) and Xe3(x,x,x) to values close to 0 and increased the occupancy of Xe1(x,x,z) to 70% which did not change with further increasing of the pressure, and also the new position Xe4 at (0,0,0) was occupied with a fractional occupancy of 45%. Further increasing of the pressure at 185 K did not cause any changing in the occupancies of the adsorption sites. The adsorption of CO 2 molecules by both ZIF-8 and MFU-4L is very different from the adsorption of noble gases: the change of the lattice parameter of MOFs during CO 2 adsorption is comparable with the changes of the lattice parameters of these MOFs during noble gas adsorption, but the determination of the exact localization of the CO 2 molecules in the cavities is complicated by the strong disorder of the CO 2 units.</p><p>MEM calculations to resolve this issue are in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The adsorption of inert gases Kr and Xe in MFU-4L was investigated and it was shown that both Kr and Xe atoms exclusively occupy the Wyckoff position 32f at approximately (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). This means that both inert gases occupy the four large pores of the unit cell, where the chlorine atom are pointing away from each other. Adsorbed atoms coordinate the 1,2,3-triazole ring. The nearest neighbors of intercalated atoms are nitrogen atoms at distances of ~ 3.71 Ǻ. The atoms of the adsorbed inert gases in both cases form a cube of edge length ~ 10.24 Ǻ. Increasing the pressure increased the occupancy of the only located gas position. At 160 K the maximal occupancy of the position by Kr atoms was ~ 42%. Further increasing of the pressure caused inhomogeneous adsorption and separation of the material into two phases: one part of sample continued to adsorb gas molecules, another desorbed almost all gas molecules. This phase separation was not visible from laboratory powder diffraction experiments due to the broad instrumental function. Analysis of this inhomogeneous adsorption by both MFU-4L and ZIF-8 requires further structural investigations.</p></div>			</div>
