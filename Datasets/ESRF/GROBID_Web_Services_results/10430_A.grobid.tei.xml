<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We divided our 24 shifts into two sessions one devoted to the FeRh as planned, the other to RIXS in Ce intermetallics (see separate report). There were two reasons. One was that we encountered some experimental difficulties running the FeRh experiment requiring changes to our experimental set-up (see below). The other was that our previous experiments on Ce intermetallics had been curtailed by 7 shifts as a result of the storage ring breakdown <ref type="bibr">(Nov. 1997)</ref>. We therefore present two reports.</p><p>Our experiments on Co-Rh magnetic alloys performed at ESRF <ref type="bibr">[Gallet et al., Phys. Rev. B 57, 7835 (1998)</ref>] have successfully shown the validity of non-resonant x-ray inelastic scattering for identifying the spin-polarization of 4d valence states. We have also shown that the technique is sensitive enough to observe modifications in the spin polarization when 15% Co or Rh is replaced by another element (Ni substituted for Co; Ru or Pd for Rh).</p><p>We use the bandpass of the first order peak of Helios II to excite a Rh 2p core electron to the continuum states (i.e., to non-polarized states). The 2p core hole is polarized due to the use of the highly circularly polarized photons (= 93%). Its decay probes the up or down spins in different proportions according to the handedness of the polarization of the photons used in the ionization. The 4d-+2p x-ray emission dichroism for the two magnetization directions is measured using a UHV-compatible high resolution x-ray spectrometer which we have specially adapted to the white beam section of ID12A. The results allow for a more straightforward interpretation than when dealing with the 3d transition metals <ref type="bibr">[Eisebitt et al., Solid State Commun. 104, 173 (1997), Gallet et al., cited above]</ref>.</p><p>Fe&amp;hl, at x=0.5 has an antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic transition at temperature Ttr well above room temperature (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This is accompanied by enhanced thermal expansion. We are particularly interested in observing the x-ray emission dichroism as the temperature crosses Ttr and as a function of x. Though we were indeed able to observe dichroism in FesORhsO (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) we found a very much larger discrepancy than we anticipated between the temperature measured by means of a thermocouple and the true temperature at the point of impact of the beam. In fact we were unable to go down to the AF-phase (that is below Tu.) despite the use of liquid nitrogen cooling of the sample holder. From the variation in temper-ature with and without the beam we estimated the heat load to be approximately 2 w.</p><p>Measurements were taken by reversing the magnetic field at each energy step. Checks on the validity of the signal were made by reversing the undulator phase and also using a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the photon polarization. The measurements, taken well above Ttr are compared with an ASW bandstructure calculation for Fe,,Rh,, in the CsCl structure.</p><p>The magnetic field was approximately 0.1 T. We are planning improvements to the sample cooling and temperature control.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>High energy spectroscopies have been at the forefront in the elucidation of cerium's mixed valent behaviour. In particular L3 x-ray absorption spectra have been extensively analysed to extract an empirical "spectroscopic valence" based on the relative intensities off1 and fO related features corresponding to a 2p +5d excitation where the core hole will either be screened by a localizedf electron (plus the 5d conduction electron) or less effectively by more delocalized hybridized 5d-4f states. There is also the small probability of a quadrupole transition leading to a very well screened 2p54f2 final state. Excitation to these three final state configurations in an x-ray absorption process are the intermediate states of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) involving the 3d-+2p decay channel [see Krisch et al., <ref type="bibr">Phys. Rev. Lett. 7 4 , 4931 (1995)</ref>].</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the RIXS data for CeF3 with its nominal configuration of 4f1 in the ground state. It is a particularly clear example of the information available from such experiments. A double structure situated in the region of 880 eV energy loss (energy loss is the difference between the incident and scattered photon energy) marks the 3d94f2 final state involving a quadrupole transition in the primary excitation. At 887 eV we observe a very highly localized 5d state identified by a Raman process both below and above threshold excitation. The peak which disperses as the excitation energy is increased from b to g is normal "resonant" fluorescence (the 3d+2p transition takes place after ionization). The intensity of the peak is related to the localization of the 5d states in this ionic compound. In the highly correlated Ce intermetallics the 5d states are less localized because of much stronger hybridization with neighboring atoms. This in turn plays a role in the 4f-Sd hybridization. In Fig . <ref type="figure">2</ref> we show RIXS data taken at the resonant energy of the quadrupole transition for a number of Ce systems with different effective 4f1 occupancy. It il second order process.</p><p>lustrates the sensitivity of this normalized to the same 3d94f2 peak amp.).</p></div>			</div>
