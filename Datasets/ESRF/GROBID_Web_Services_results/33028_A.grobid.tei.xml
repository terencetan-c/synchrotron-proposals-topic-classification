<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Tromsø Structural Biology Centre -application for block allocation of beamtime </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Background The Norwegian Structural Biology Centre (NorStruct) is administrated by the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tromsø, and was established in 2002 through a national initiative in functional genomics in Norway. The aim of this initiative is the establishment of a structural biology centre of high international standard for determination and analysis of the 3D-structures of biologically active macromolecules. In addition to taking part in projects nationwide as an external collaborator, NorStruct has been given the opportunity to initiate and develop internal projects at the centre. Our involvement in external projects range from consultancy to full scale structure determination and structure-function analysis, including hosting project workers for training and providing access to facilities.</p><p>Internal projects at NorStruct focus on proteins expressed by the fish pathogenic bacteria Vibrio salmonicida and enzymes involved in the defence systems of Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon, and with a structural genomics approach to virulence factors and defence molecules of the model organisms. "Structural genomics studies of Vibrio salmonicida", is one part of a more comprehensive project on this psychrophilic and pathogenic bacteria, also including genome sequencing and cellular/functional studies. The structural part of the project is divided into sub-groups based on functional aspects of the proteins. A) "Structurefunction relation studies of proteins involved in oxidative stress", B) "Structure-function relation studies of nucleases", C) "Structure-function studies of DNA repair proteins", D) "Structure-function studies of hypothetical proteins", and E) "Structure determination of virulence factors expressed by V. salmonicida".</p><p>External projects originate both in the academic society in Norway and in the biotecnology industry, and include nucleases and DNA binding proteins, phosphatases, isocitrate dehydrogenases and several other proteins of academic and commercial interest.</p><p>The majority of the projects are the subject of structure-function-relation studies, where one seeks to increase the the knowledge about the relationship between structure and biophysical properties such as specificity, efficiency and stability. Succeding structure determination several of the proteins will be the target of redesign of one or more such properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p>Experiment 01-02-739 was allocated 9 shifts in September 2006. Crystals of four different proteins were tested for diffraction. Five crystals were found to be suitable for data collection: 1. MopE from Methylococcus capsulatus co-crystallized with calcium (1 set) 2.</p><p>Human fibroblast growth factor (1 set) 3.</p><p>SoxR from Vibrio salmonicida (2 sets) 4.</p><p>Lysozyme (1 set)</p><p>In addition, crystals of four other proteins were tested, but the diffraction quality was not sufficient for data collection.</p></div>

We also experienced several times during data collection that there were no connection between the detector and the computer as loads of blank images were recorded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of MopE from Methylococcus capsulatus</head><p>Copper is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms but is toxic at elevated levels. It is therefore important for the cell to keep a tight control on the level of copper ions. MopE is a protein that is involved in this process, and it has been found to bind both copper and calcium. MopE can easily be crystallized from ammonium sulfate and Tris buffer using the hanging drop method. The morphology and cell parameters of MopE crystals change depending on the metal ion added to the crystallization reservoir.</p><p>Calcium is expected to stabilize the protein and prevent auto-proteolytic activity, something which is seen in all other MopE structures solved.</p><p>The crystal belong to the orthorhombic space group I222 and 100 frames with oscillation of 1.0° and 20 sec. exposure were collected. The crystal diffracted poorly and could be scaled with reasonable statistics only to about 2.3 Å. Analysis of the structure showed that ths protein was identical to the structures already solved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human fibroblast growth factor</head><p>The fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are proteins involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes. By controlling cell proliferation, differentiation function, FGFs are of crucial importance in the development of normal cells. The growth factors are also involved in the maintenance of tissue and healing and repair of wounds. In addition, FGFs have been found to be heavily involved in less favorable processes that ultimately may have pathological consequences. The acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) possess unusual low stability, and in order to understand the basis and nature of this low stability and thereby learn more about factors influencing protein stability, a range of "stability mutants" of aFGF has been constructed</p><p>Data were collected on a triple mutant to 1.6 Å. The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with cell parameters of about 34 x 57 x57 Å 3 . Data were recorded in 100 frames with oscillation of 1.0° and 15 sec. exposure. The structure of the protein was solved by molecular replacement. Analysis of the protein and preparation of a manuscript is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SoxR from Vibrio salmonicida</head><p>SoxR is involved in the regulation/stimulation of oxidative stress genes. In E.coli SoxR activates the transcription of soxS, which in turn controls the superoxide response regulon. In V.salmonicida the soxS gene is not present in the genome (similar as in P.aeruginosa) and alternative activators must be present. SoxR contains a 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster that may act as a redox sensor system that recognises superoxide. The variable redox state of the Fe-S cluster is employed in vivo to modulate the transcriptional activity of soxR in response to specific types of oxidative stress. Upon reduction of 2Fe-2S cluster, SoxR reversibly loses its transcriptional activity, but retains its DNA binding affinity.</p><p>No protein with homologous structure to SoxR is known. The structure of SoxR must therefore be solved by heavy atom methods. Data were collected on two crystals soaked with heavy atoms, one putative mercury derivative and one putative tungsten derivative. Data were recorded in 360 frames with oscillation of 0.5° and exposure of 45 sec. on the mercury derivative.</p><p>The crystal diffracted to about 3 Å. Indexing suggested that the crystal could belong to the monoclinic space group C2 or one of the trigonal space groups. Processing of the data was not stable, and unfortunately we have still not been able to establish the right space group.</p><p>The tungsten data were recorded on more that 1900 frames with 0.25° oscillation and 60 sec. exposure. The data could be processed in the monoclinic space group C2 with reasonable scaling statistics to 3Å. Weak anomalous signals were observed to about 5 Å, confirming the presence of a heavy atom in the structure.</p><p>Unfortunately the signals were too weak to phase the structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lysozyme</head><p>Data were collected on a lysozyme test crystal in order to compare the statistics of data collected at SNBL with data collected on a Rigaku MSC home source generator. The crystal diffracted to 1.3 Å, but data was difficult to index and processing was impossible.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Edward Hough, Arne O.
