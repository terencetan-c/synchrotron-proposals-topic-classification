<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Metal imaging in Gram-negative bacteria: insights into mode of action of antibiotics </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification of the project</head><p>The dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a global threat of healthcare systems and novel therapeutic options are urgently needed as demanded by the WHO. We hence studied the repurposed drug nitroxoline (Nx) as a novel therapy option for infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria. We observed a high activity of Nx against Escherichia coli and other relevant pathogens. However, the mode of action of Nx is unclear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>Based on our previous results, we hypothesized that Nx could act as an ionophore by transporting divalent metal ions (especially Fe, Zn, Mn) into E. coli. High amounts of Nx could perturb metal homeostasis leading to subsequent cell death. We indeed verified the accumulation of metal ions within the cells by employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). However, metal localization inside the cell is unknown. For bacteria like Deinococcus radiodurans, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) revealed that intracellular metal ions are not evenly distributed but stored in highly organized intracellular compartments, and this was essential for resistance against metal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Since metal homeostasis is obviously crucial for the mode of action of Nx, we reasoned that XRF nanoimaging would be the most suited technique to study the localization of intracellular metal ions after Nx treatment of E. coli. We hence applied for beam-time at beamline ID-16A.</p><p>We aimed to achieve the following objectives:</p><p>(1) Impact of Nx on bacterial cell morphology (2) Confirmation of intracellular metal data obtained by ICP-MS (3) Novel insights into role of other biological relevant metals (4) Quantification of metals in Nx-resistant E. coli (5) Subcellular distribution of metals upon exposure of Nx</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Execution of experiments</head><p>At our institute, a Nx-resistant E. coli (Nx-R) was generated by evolution experiments for comparison purposes with an isogenic Nx-susceptible E. coli strain (Nx-S). E. coli strains were treated with Nx or DMSO as a control for different time points (0, 15 min, 1 h, 6 h) and Nx concentrations (0; 1 µg/mL; 10 µg/ml) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Antibiotic effect and cell numbers were quantified by live cell plating.</p><p>At ESRF, cells were thawed and cell density adjusted with PBS after control by inverted light microscopy. Silica membranes were spotted with 10 µL of bacterial suspension and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen (plunge freezing). Additionally, bacterial samples were freshly prepared (cultivation and Nx treatment) at the microbiological facility building (EMBL) due to moderate quality of various freeze plunged samples (e.g. ice crystals, low cell density, perturbed surface).</p><p>XRF experiments were performed under cryo-conditions to obtain spectra and quantify elements by their Klevel emission lines. Low-resolution and fast-position mapping by combined X-ray phase contrast and XRF coarse scans in low-dose mode (6.1×10 10 ph/s) were performed using a scan step size of 300 × 300 nm 2 and a dwell time of 100 ms to identify bacteria. Thereafter, XRF fine scans in high-dose mode (2.49×10 11 ph/s) were done with a step size of either 30 × 30 or 15 × 15 nm 2 and a dwell time of 50 ms to obtain quantitative elemental density maps. After fitting and normalization of data, mean intracellular elemental area density were recorded for elements (e.g. Zn, Fe, Ca) and weighted 2D maps were created.</p><p>Justification of beam time: The requested time of 12 shifts was continuously and comprehensively utilized. We were able to measure seven samples even though duration of measurement took longer than planned and despite several time-consuming technical obstacles (e.g. beam dumps, optimization of freeze plunging).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Cell morphology: Comparison of Nx treated and untreated Nx-S E. coli revealed a significant reduction of the cell length after treatment with 10 µg/ml Nx from 4.3 ± 0.8 µm to 3.1 ± 0.4 µm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantification of biologically relevant metals:</head><p>Data indicate an increase of manganese, zinc and (to a lesser extent) iron after Nx-treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Thereby, the ICP-MS data could be validated by XRF and further confirm our working hypothesis. Notably, we observed an increase of copper, which had not been investigated by ICP-MS. Since copper is almost found exclusively in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we computed an in-house script with the help of our local contact Dr. Marina Eckermann to distinguish between copper content in the periplasm versus the cytoplasm. Copper content in the periplasm was indeed 8-fold higher in Nx treated cells compared to untreated E. coli, whereas increase of copper in the cytoplasm was only 2.5-fold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). This points to a novel, yet unknown role of copper in the mode of action of Nx. Importantly, this profound periplasm-specific enrichment was not observed for other metals.</p><p>Due to several time-consuming technical obstacles (e.g. quality of freeze plunged membranes, inhomogeneous cell morphology after 6 h and high Nx treatment, several beam dumps), we could just briefly analyse two samples of with Nx-R with only 1-5 scanned cells each. Comparison of treated and untreated Nx-R show a Nxinduced decrease of intracellular metal ions, indicating that Nx resistance is caused by a high activity of efflux pumps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). Further measurements with different Nx concentrations and incubation times could provide new insights into the resistance mechanism and deletion mutants could be used to identify the efflux pumps involved.</p><p>Subcellular distribution of metals upon exposure of Nx: Two-dimensional mapping of intracellular metal localization revealed an accumulation of iron in specific areas in particular in the control without Nx treatment throughout the cell; in comparison, calcium or zinc, which seems to be evenly distributed in the cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> A). Preliminary data showed that localization of iron cluster disappeared after Nx treatment. This might indicate that Nx disrupts organization of metals in bacteria. To analyse this in detail we aimed to generate 3D-XRF tomograms of Nx treated and untreated cells. However, due to computational issues during XRF fine scans in high-dose mode the measurement could not be finished.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Using XRF nanoimaging, we demonstrated that the bacterial cell size decreased significantly in response to Nx treatment. We confirmed the Nx dependent accumulation of several metal ions in E. coli, which clearly supports the ionophore hypothesis on the mode of action of Nx. We furthermore, observed an increase of copper in the periplasm, which we will validate in functional assays. Our imaging data furthermore suggest that iron is present in certain compartments of the cell. However, due to the lack of 3D mapping, no further conclusions can be drawn and should hence be further investigated. Due to time constraints, the data on Nx-R are derived from few cells, but indicate that Nx leads to reduced intracellular metal content. Further analysis would gain new insights regarding the resistance mechanism. Moreover, we gained important insights on sample preparation and Nx treatment conditions of bacteria for XRF.</p><p>We think that these data are encouraging and provide important new insights in the mode of action of Nx. The data are however not complete: (a) most of the results are derived from few cells, (b) the Nx-R strain could not be tested entirely, (c) and a 3D tomogram is missing. We would hence like to apply for a continuation proposal. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Stephan Göttig, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Hospital of Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany (Main Proposer) Celia Romao, Universidade Nova de Lisboa UNL, Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica, Oeiras, Portugal Manuela Tietgen, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Hospital of Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany Report:</figDesc></figure>
