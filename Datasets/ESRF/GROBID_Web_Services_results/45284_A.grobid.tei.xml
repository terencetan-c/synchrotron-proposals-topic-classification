<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have investigated the self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) using our hermetic wetting cell. The cell is designed to allow: (i) deposition of NP dispersions onto solid substrates, (ii) controlled macroscopic solvent evaporation, and (iii) nano-scale solvent adsorption/desorption onto the pre-assembled NP films. We devoted particular attention to the investigation of an unexpected phenomena of NP segregation at the solvent/vapor interface, that we observe after each fresh NP solution injection onto a solid substrate. The injection is performed in condition of high solvent humidity inside the cell, so that the macroscopic solvent evaporation is negligible and the NP solution/vapor interface is stable. We have characterized the structure of the interfacial NP films by X-Ray Reflectivity (XR) and Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (GISAXS) performed with a X-ray beam of energy 8 keV. We used a vertically mounted 1D detector for XR measurements, and a 2D detector for GISAXS measurements. We injected onto a 2"-diameter Silicon wafer 1 mL of a 6.5 nm core-size decane-thiol (DT) Au NPs dispersion in toluene. The volume injected contained a total number of NPs to cover the whole wafer surface with a single layer. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the measured Reflectivity R normalized by the Fresnel Reflectivity R f at different stages of the experiment. The first curve (black) is measured at the bare silicon wafer surface, before NP solution injection. The other three curves, scaled for clarity, are measured at the NP-solution/vapor interface 1 hour (blue, •1e -1 ), 2 hours and 30 minutes (red, •1e -3 ) and 4 hours (green, •1e -5 ) after the injection. The blue curve exhibits a clear bump at low q z values, with an intensity higher than 1. This bump indicates the presence of a NP film. The corresponding GISAXS pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) does not show clear signatures of in-plane correlation, even though a faint shoulder can be recognized at q xy ≃0.08 Å -1 . 1 hour and a half later, the bump in the R/R f becomes less intense, indicating a less dense interfacial film. The GISAXS pattern becomes more isotropic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), indicating an higher in-plane disorder. 4 hours after the injection, the R/R f is practically flat, with a decay due to solvent/vapor interfacial roughness, and the corresponding GISAXS pattern is completely isotropic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). The NP segregation at the solvent/vapor interface is therefore only a transitory effect, and after some hours the particles are dissolved again into the bulk solvent. The causes of this phenomena are not clear at the moment, but this layering effect is reproduced after each new injection of fresh NP solution. Further investigations carried out with an high-energy X-ray beam (70 keV, ID15A) showed that no accumulation of NPs is present, at any moment, at the buried substrate/NPsolution interface.</p><p>We dedicated the second part of the beamtime to the investigations of the NP films resulting from the fast macroscopic solvent evaporation of different NP dispersions, and to the study of the effects of subsequent nano-scale solvent adsorption/desorption. The selected rate for the macroscopic evaporation determines a recession of the solvent/vapor interface in the direction perpendicular to the substrate plane of about 120 µm/min. In particular, we have grown and characterized a monolayer of 6.5 nm core-size DT-Au NPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>), a multilayer of a 2.8 nm and 6.5 nm core-size DT-Au NPs mixture (number ratio small-NPs:large-NPs 60:40, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>),  -1 ), 2 hours and 30 minutes (red, •1e</p><p>-3 ) and 4 hours (green, •1e -5 ) after the NP solution injection.</p><p>and a nanocrystal superlattices made of 8.2 nm core size oleic-acid (OA) capped PbSe NPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows an example of controlled nano-scale solvent adsorption study performed on the film composed of a mixture of 2.8 nm and 6.5 nm core-size Au NPs. The solvent adsorption onto the substrate is achieved by controlling the temperature offset ΔT between the sample and the toluene vapour inside the cell, in thermal equilibrium with a liquid toluene reservoir. Toluene films of thickness ranging from about 1 nm to 2.5 nm can be adsorbed onto a flat silicon surface as ΔT is changed from 2.7 K to 140 mK. After fast evaporation, in almost dry conditions (ΔT=2.7 K), the GISAXS pattern shows a large q xy ≃0.18 Å -1 isotropic ring, indicating small NPs disorder, and two faint rods at smaller q xy ≃0.08 Å -1 , indicating in-plane correlation of the large NPs. Qualitatively, as ΔT is decreased and more solvent is adsorbed onto the NP film, the inplane organization of the large NPs is enhanced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>), and the correlation rods at q xy ≃0.08 Å -1 becomes better defined, while the small NPs gives only an isotropic signal. The evolution of the GISAXS pattern indicates a structural reorganization of the NP superlattice at the nano-scale level. This is another intriguing process that deserves deeper investigations.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -GISAXS patterns measured at the stable NP solution/vapor interface.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,73.76,228.74,184.40,137.96" type="bitmap" /></figure>
