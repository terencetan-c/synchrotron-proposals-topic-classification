<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>______________________________________________________________________________________</head><p>Experiment title: St. Andrews Dundee BAG Experiment number: LS-1951 Beamline: ID29 Date of experiment: from: 24 th MARCH 2001 to:25th MARCH 2001 Date of report: 21 st August 2001 Shifts: 3 Local contact(s): Dr. Gordon Leonard Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): William N. Hunter*, Charles S. Bond*, Lauris E. Kemp*, Mads Gabrielsen* Report:</p><p>Isoprenoid biosynthesis Three-wavelength MAD experiments were carried out on two crystal forms of a selenomethionine derivative of 2C-methylerythritol synthase (MECPS). A XANES scan was recorded and used to identify the wavelengths to be used. Form I (P2 1 2 1 2, 54 x 114 x 88Å) diffracts to 2.1Å, form II (I2 1 3, a=144Å) only to 3.0Å. Form II suffered severe radiation damage during the experiment so really only the f" data is acceptable (Rsym 7.8%, 100% complete and redundancy of 8). The lesson we have learned is that we need to attenuate more on this beamline. The form I crystal gave three wavelengths with greater then 96% completeness, and Rsym's between 5 and 5.4% with redundancy of greater than 2. The use of direct methods (SnB, SHELXD) has identified plausible Se positions in form I which unfortunately do not produce an interpretable electron density map. There appears to be some useful phase information but we need to obtain further derivative data. The low redundancy of the orthorhombic data may be contributing to the poor phasing observed.</p><p>Our previous MAD experiment on a selenomethionine derivative of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2Cmethyl-D-erythritol synthetase (DMES) failed to identify the Se positions. (see previous report on BM14). We prepared a potential platinum derivative of this protein then carried out a XANES scan which showed the presence of the metal and selected wavelengths for data collection. We screened several crystals searching for an appropriate sample though in all cases the diffraction quality was poor. Resolution tests of a new crystal form (small needles) of DMES showed that it was inferior to the tetragonal blocks first obtained and only diffracted to between 4 and 5Å.</p><p>Studies of DNA/metal complexes with Hjc, a DNA resolvase A number of candidate crystals of an Hjc-Holliday Junction complex have been tested. One crystal form gave 7Å diffraction which could be indexed as I cubic, a = 143 Å. This corresponds to crystals which provided 3.5 Å data collected previously on native Hjc and, while these cocrystals stain positive for DNA (ethidium bromide), it is as yet uncertain whether they represent the true complex. Further studies must be undertaken. Data collection on a candidate Hjc-Mg 2+ complex yielded low quality data (due to poor crystal quality) but which nevertheless indicated the absence of Mg 2+ once the refinement was completed.</p><p>Ser/Thr Protein kinase Three large (0.3mm) beautiful (absolutely gorgeous) cubic blocks of the stress-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK2) each grown under different conditions were tested and only diffract to 6Å. This is equivalent to the diffraction limit observed in-house therefore no datasets were recorded.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Postal address: User Office, ESRF, B.P. 220, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex, France Street address: 6 rue Jules Horowitz, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex Telephone: +33 (0)4 7688 2552; Fax: +33 (0)4 7688 2020; e-mail: useroff@esrf.fr ESRF Experiment Report Form, July 1999</figDesc></figure>
