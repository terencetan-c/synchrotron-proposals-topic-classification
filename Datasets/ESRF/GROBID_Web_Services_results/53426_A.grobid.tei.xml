<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Proposal Title The local structure of amorphous pure and Ti-doped Ta 2 O 5 films Beamline ID15A Dates 12 -13 Nov. 2014</p><p>The aim of the proposal was to study the local structure of amorphous Ta 2 O 5 by means of a total scattering experiment with high energy X-rays. This material is applied to build highly reflective mirrors used in interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In order to study the influence of both the annealing and the Ti doping on the coating structure four samples were prepared: pure Ta 2 O 5 (annealed and not), Ti-doped Ta 2 O 5 (annealed and not annealed).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For these samples experimental plan was articulated as follows: 1. acquisition of high quality synchrotron powder diffraction patterns at ESRF at room temperature suitable for pair distribution function (PDF) analysis 2. reduction of the total scattering data to obtain the PDF function 3. obtaining difference curves between the reference sample (unsubstituted and not annealed) and the substituted and/or annealed samples (difference modelling) 4. apply a reverse Monte Carlo method to analyse total scattering data During the experiment we were able to acquire data for PDF analysis only from two samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>); in fact, at first 6 shifts were allocated to analyze the four samples, but afterwards beam time was rescheduled down to only 3 shifts. In any case reliable data were collected from these two samples; the analysis by reverse Monte Carlo method is still in progress in order to determine their average short-range structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: PDF of two samples analyzed by a grazing incidence geometry evidencing subtle differences between a pure Ta 2 O 5 and a Ti-doped Ta 2 O 5 film (ID15A data).</figDesc><graphic coords="1,58.20,400.84,336.00,253.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
