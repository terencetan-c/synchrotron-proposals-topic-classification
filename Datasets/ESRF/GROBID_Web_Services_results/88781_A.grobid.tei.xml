<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The effect of the gas environment upon the structure and behaviour of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 was studied. Pt-Sn catalysts are widely used for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction. The behaviour of these catalysts under oxidative conditions is not widely examined and is interesting to explore in view of understanding deactivation. Reduction usually leads to alloy formation, while an oxidising gas can cause atomic rearrangement like dealloying or segregation. The bimetallic catalysts were prepared by wet-incipient impregnation (WI) on high or low surface area MgAl2O4 support (HSA -97m 2 /g and LSA -5m 2 /g) and by atomic layer deposition (ALD) (on LSA support). These catalysts were tested for redox activity and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The active phase is a PtSn alloy that is formed upon reduction of the catalysts at 873K. This was followed by TPO with CO2 at 873K and then reduction again under H2 atmosphere before performing RWGS. Structural differences based on preparation method (WI vs. ALD) were investigated by XAS as well as the effect of a redox environment on the catalyst. Further, different ratios of Pt:Sn (1:1, 3:1, 5:1) were used to see the effect of the respective metal compositions on structure, reduction, phase etc.</p></div>

A clear reduction is observed for the WI sample (left -96% reduction), while the white line intensity for the ALD sample is initially almost at the level of the Pt-foil, which is expected due to it being deposited as Pt (right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">XRD measurements during the 4 treatments for the Pt:Sn catalyst (HSA-WI)</head><p>On the last beam time day, the setup was changed to allow for simultaneous in situ XAS-XRD recording. XAS was now recorded using a photodiode, while a Pilatus detector measured the diffracted X-ray intensity. The sample was now mounted in a modified microtomo reactor cell, allowing X-ray detection above the horizontal plane. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows a picture of the setup and an in-situ XRD measurement recorded during in-situ treatment of the catalyst. This in-situ XRD measurement was synchronized with the in-situ XANES measurements and both of them were measured together up to a temperature of 773K. While in-situ XAS gives information about the chemical state and short range order, the XRD probes the long range order. The XRD data were collected in order to determine which Pt:Sn phase was present/formed during the experimental process and various such images have been collected.</p><p>Concluding, a nice set of XAS data has been collected on several Pt:Sn/MgAl2O4 samples both at Pt and Sn edge under different conditions (reduction, CO2-oxidation and RWGS). This will allow for several comparisons to be made, e.g. synthesis method (ALD vs. WI), support (HSA vs. LSA), ratio Pt:Sn, and their respective influence on the structure and behavior of the bimetallic catalyst. Some differences already appear from a first comparison of XANES and R-space spectra. This will be further examined by modelling of these data. In addition, a first use of combined in situ XAS-XRD was made and evaluated in collaboration with the beam line scientist. The results of this campaign will be used in a publication with a working title 'Nature of Pt:Sn sites under reducing/oxidizing environment studied by in-situ XAS".</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimental schedule for in situ XAS/XANES measurement during alloy formation and decomposition processes.Left: in situ H2-TPR, followed by in situ CO2-TPO; right: in situ H2-TPR, followed by in situ RWGS</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure3shows the R-space signal of the as prepared samples. There is a clear difference in the intensity of the peaks of the fresh samples. This is because for the ALD sample the Pt is deposited as Pt while in the wet-impregnated samples upon calcination Pt is present as PtO2. The Pt:Sn LSA and HSA samples have an oxide peak due to their calcination in air. The figure suggests that the LSA sample has less O and more Pt-Pt as compared to the HSA sample.</figDesc></figure>
