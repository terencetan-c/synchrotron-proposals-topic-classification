<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Nanoparticles dynamics in Drosophila synsytial embryos </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Background Nanoparticles (NP) have received large attention for their interaction with biological systems and the resulting implications in nanomedicine (in diagnostics or as nanocarriers for drug delivery) and in nanotoxicology. Despite the wide available literature, several aspects of this interaction are still unclear <ref type="bibr">(Cha et al., 2007)</ref>. The difficulty in defining what makes NP more likely to interact with cells is related to the poor knowledge of the mechanisms of NP internalization on one side and of the effects that NP might have on cell physiology and biochemistry on the other. Toxicological studies have investigated the main aspect of NP impact on cellular processes <ref type="bibr">(Lewinski et al., 2008)</ref>, but so far no attention has been devoted to their effects on the mitotic process and genomic instability, which eventually could lead to cancer. There are evidences that TiO2 NPs, widely present in commonly used commercial products, can interact in vitro with tubulin and microtubules (MTs) by acting on the MT polymerization rate <ref type="bibr">(Gheshlanghi et al., 2008)</ref>. Specifically, TiO2 NPs have been shown to affect the rate and extent of MT assembly and change their conformation. From this derives the importance of a detailed study that could clarify whether NP, once internalized, either free in the cytoplasm or compartmentalized in lysosomes and/or other intracellular structures, could interfere with the mitotic spindles and the related highly dynamic microtubules (MTs) <ref type="bibr">(Downing, 2000)</ref>. In our research, we hypothesize that once NP enter the cell, they can interfere with the spindle MTs possibly affecting the highly choreographed sequence of motility events that characterize spindle assembly, thus preventing the completion of cell division and eventually favor defects in chromosomes segregation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental description</head><p>To address the interference of NPs with the mitotic process, we performed X-ray synchrotron microtomography on the Drosophila syncytial blastoderm-stage embryo, a biological model which is a well-documented system for mitosis research <ref type="bibr">(Brust-Mascher et al., 2011)</ref>. Drosophila embryos (length 500µm, width 200µm) were injected with different types of NPs (gold, SiO2,) with a size of 15-100 nm. Each NP was suspended in a proper solvent and directly injected into the embryo in order to reach a cytoplasmic concentration ranging between 50 and 200µg/ml. To allow NP diffusion and possibly interaction with the spindles. the embryo were then fixed 20 to 60 minutes after the injection. The fixed embryos were then placed in quartz capillary for observation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The outcome of the experiment was only partially positive. It was indeed possible to obtain low resolution 3D reconstruction of the internal structure of the embryo (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), but, due to some technical limitations, it was not possible to take full advantage of the beamline resolution. Two aspects were critical: 1) the radiation damage was too severe when the maximum resolution was attempted, resulting in sample deformation during the acquisition; 2) the presence of reconstruction rings that reduced that possibility to evidence the finer details of the images including the single NPs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Although we have been able to identify the presence of NP aggregates in the embryo, we could not prove their relation with the internal structures and mitotic spindles. It was not possible to clarify whether all the NPs were present only in agglomerated form, as a result of their interaction with the cytoplasm, or whether a significant fraction of non-agglomerated, individual nanoparticles where also present in proximity of the mitotic spindles. However, a preliminary test performed on the same Drosophila samples after the recent introduction of significant beamline improvements evidenced the possibility to overcome both limitations. The addition of a cryostat, minimizing the radiation damage, and the introduction of improved strategies for the image acquisition allow, in fact, to remove almost completely the presence of the reconstruction rings and to improve drastically the quality and the resolution of the scan reconstruction obtained at the maximum resolution.
