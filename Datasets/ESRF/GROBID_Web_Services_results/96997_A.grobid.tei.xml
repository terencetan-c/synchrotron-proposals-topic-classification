<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Once the characterization of the monolayers were made, we started to study the hybrid structures. Structures consisting in GGG//YIG/YBCO were examined by XRD. In this case, not only the peaks corresponding to the monolayer of YIG/GGG are visible, but a plycrystalline material is also present which correspond to YBCO. This is shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">figure 4</ref>. Structures formed by MgO//YBCO/YIG were also studied with GIXRD concluding that YIG is deposited in a polycrystalline way on the superconductor layer.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Hybrid structures formed by ferromagnetic (FM) and superconductor (SC) layers has recently attracted great interest from the scientific community. Recently, such combination of layers has been studied theoretically by several research groups. However, only a few experimentally attempts have been to date. Thermal injection of spin polarized currents into superconductors allows the spin current not to be suppressed being able to be propagated over long distances by the thermally excited quasiparticles. Hence, this unusual hybrid structures allows to explore new spin current driven effects that can be promising for new technological applications. Spin Seebeck Effect (SSE) is one of the most used techniques for spin injection in SC but is highly dependent on the interface quality between both layers, the FM and the SC layer. Due to this, controlling the characteristics of the interface becomes crucial to study the injection of spin currents into a superconductor layer.</p><p>During this experiment we have characterized these types of hybrid structures consisting in a layer of 𝑌𝑌𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 3 𝑂𝑂 7 (YBCO) as superconductor material, and 𝑌𝑌 3 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 5 𝑂𝑂 12 (YIG) as ferrimagnetic material, deposited by pulsed laser deposition on MgO or 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 3 𝐺𝐺𝐵𝐵 5 𝑂𝑂 12 (GGG) substrates. First, monolayers of YBCO on MgO substrate and YIG on GGG substrate were studied by Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD). The YBCO//MgO monolayer were examined and, as it is shown in the figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, it has a pollycrystaline structure. However, the intense diffraction peaks present in the diffraction map show that its structure is partially oriented. On the other hand, YIG//GGG thin film present a quasicrystalline structure. The intense peak present in the figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the high degree of orientation of the layer. However, it exists another localized diffraction peak which have lower intensity than the other one. For that, reason we can conclude that is almost completely monocrystalline. Furthermore, Laue oscillations are clearly visible in 1D diffractograms indicating a high degree of crystallinity.</p></div>			</div>
