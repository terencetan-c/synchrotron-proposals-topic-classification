<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Palladium-catalysed oxidative carbonylation (PCOC) is a unique reaction which demonstrates prolonged pH oscillations (up to a month) in a batch laboratory set-up without the need for addition of substrate. Beside this fantastic property, PCOC also exhibits temperature-dependent product selectivity and substrate diversity (including polymeric substrates). This extraordinary oscillatory reaction system has the major potential in the development of advanced self-oscillating polymeric architectures. However, the wide implementation of this reaction is associated with two major problems: (i) use of CO as a reactant and (ii) methanol as a solvent. In order to solve these two problems, we need to obtain a complete understanding of the mechanism of oscillations, especially of the catalytic processes involving palladium, so that benign, more environmentally friendly oscillatory reactions can be designed. So far, the knowledge in this area is poor and data are contenious.</p><p>To get an insight into palladium catalysis in PCOC, we aimed to collect XANES and EXAFS spectra at all stages of the reaction: from the so-called 'induction' period through to oscillations in pH. A highly novel reactor capable of sustaining prolonged pH oscillations was designed and manufactured to enable in situ XANES and EXAFS to be performed during PCOC (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Five cells were run in parallel on a customised stirring stage to maximise performance and enable studies of two catalytic species at the same time -palladium acetate (PdAc) and palladium iodide (PdI2). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Reactor cell This approach has enabled us to directly study, for the first time, the changes in oxidation state and atomic environment of palladium during catalysis. Although the data analysis is still in progress (beamtime performed in Feb 2018), we have captured the changes during the crucial 'induction' stage of the reaction, where Pd catalyst generated in situ (PdI2/PdAc+KI) is purged with CO and air.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows evolution of XANES spectra at different stages of the reaction while Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> gives recorded pH vs. time during the induction stage. Furthermore, after addition of substrate, phenylacetylene (PhAc), we observed a dramatic change in signal quality. Previously, it has been postulated that addition of substrate causes the first conversion stage, during which Pd 2+ species (in solution) are converted into Pd 0 species (insoluble/particulate). Thus, the changes in XANES spectra quality indirectly indicate that this assumption is correct. However, the collection of high-quality, fittable data in this case was challenging.</p><p>The reaction pH was monitored until the oscillations in pH occurred. Due to the low quality of the XANES data, we established a strategy of collecting samples at the bottom and top of oscillations and then binning them to obtain one good XANES spectrum for the two pH extremes. However, after binning 100 XANES spectra, the signal quality was still insufficient. Moreover, an unexpected effect of X-ray radiation on the reaction was observed. Radiating the sample for 60 s for a single XANES collection led to the appearance of spikes in the pH (labelled with single asterisks in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), whereas multiple scans over short period of time, i.e. prolonged radiation (labelled with three asterisks), caused irreversible increase in pH. In the PdI2-catalysed reaction, the starting oscillations ceased as soon as the reaction was irradiated with X-rays. This effect of X-rays on pH in palladiumcatalysed reactions was only observed after the addition of substrate and is clearly associated with a species generated during conversion. These findings indicate that the radiation damage of the catalytic species occurring during the reaction prevents from collecting a full set of data in the reaction setup we used. However, findings also show that a continuous stirred-tank flow reactor (CSTR) with a flow-through cell for data collection is a suitable alternative set-up to prevent the radiation damage and gain acceptable signal.</p><p>As the induction period was not susceptible to radiation damage, quality in situ XANES data could be obtained during this phase of the reaction. The data obtained for the 'induction' stage is of incredible importance, since it sheds the light on the oxidative processes in palladium during CO incorporation. Consequently, during our beamtime we also studied other palladium catalysts [PdO, Pd (I)] during the 'induction' stage and we were capable to correlate changes in XANES spectra with the ability of each catalyst to generate oscillations in the pH. These findings are being prepared for a publication and, importantly, will form the basis of future work. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof Paul D.
