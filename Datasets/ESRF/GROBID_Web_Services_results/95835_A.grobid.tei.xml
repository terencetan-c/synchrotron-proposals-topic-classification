<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The initial aims for the experiments were to explore the interaction of intense shockwaves with clumps of dense materialsimulating what may be encountered when a shockwave launched from a supernova/other event interacts with interstellar clouds, planets and asteroids. The experiments built on those performed for HC-4679 in December 2021, where it was shown that a high quality, large scale planar shockwave was able to be produced in water by exploding a planar wire array with a small, 30kA pulsed power generator.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In total over ~4 days 54 experiments were performed, many requiring multiple hours to prepare by the team. With 16 bunch mode, two Shimadzu cameras were fielded to enable no missed bunchesi.e. continual radiographic 'movies' could be produced with interframe times of 176ns over almost ~50µs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of results</head><p>Radiographs of the shockwaves produced by the planar arrays enabled both the density of the water behind the shockwave and the speed of the shockwave to be measuredhence all the state variables of the water behind the shock could be determined form the Rankine Hugoniot conditions: Spherical targets of different density and strength were fielded in the area above the array. With low density polystyrene targets, the target could be seen to invert and implode along the direction of the shockwave with a speed of ~1300ms -1 : Shock View end on to wire array</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploding wires</head><p>The dynamics of these and other higher density targets were presented in a talk by Simon Bland at the IEEE ICOPS conference in 2022 and are now being analyzed further for publication. The experiments have suggested a more powerful driver would be beneficial, which we are hoping to test in experiments in December 2022; further better control of the targetry is needed, with initial aerogel experiments already being performed in August 2022.</p><p>In order to increase the available drive pressures, convergence was employed with both cylindrical and spherical configurations. Previous experiments on large scale pulsed power drivers (up to 2.5MA current) have demonstrated that high speed convergent shockwaves could be produced by exploding cylindrical arrays of wires underwater. On the large scale drivers the production of shockwaves was measured through laser imaging (though only the speed of the convergent shockwave could be measured, no densities or other properties could be inferred). Experiments with spherical arrays could not be analyzed in such a way, and the production of shockwaves in these configurations was only assumed based on limited evidence of localized damage to targets and spectrometry of light emitted from the center of the arrays. In our ESRF experiments in February we measured for the first time the production of spherical shockwaves and their interaction with low density targets on their axis:</p><p>Both the position of the shockwave and the dynamics of the target as it exploded could be measuredin future experiments with a more powerful driver significantly more symmetric targets can be manufactured. These results were presented in an invited talk by Simon Bland at the Znet US workshop.</p><p>During the August beamtime we also explored methods to shape and manipulate the shockwaves generated by exploding wires through the use of different shaped brass reflectors. We were able to produce, flat, convergent and divergent shockwaves from a simple planar input shock, sending this shockwave into an area of undisturbed water adjacent to the wires. We were also able to take a single input shockwave and generate a train of multiple smaller shocks through a modulated 'comb' These results were also presented in the talk by Simon Bland at the IEEE ICOPS conference in 2022, and will be utilized in future experiments at ESRF, enabling better separation of target materials from the driver, and smoother increases in pressure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>20mm diameter spherical array made of 21x63µm Cu wires at 3.7mm polystyrene sphere 8mm</figDesc></figure>
