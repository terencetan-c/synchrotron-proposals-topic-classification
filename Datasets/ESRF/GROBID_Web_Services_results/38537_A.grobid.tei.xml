<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The AMO 2 (A= H, Li, Na; M= 3d transition metal) compounds have been the subject of many investigations in the last 20 years due to their potential application as intermediate electrodes in rechargeable Li batteries. In the last few years, these systems have also attracted considerable interest from experimentalists and theorists in physics because of the two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice geometry. Here, the transitionmetal ions are located at the center of edge-sharing O octahedra, forming a lattice of regular or isoscele triangles (depending on M), which map into the well-known 2D triangular lattice (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Among all compounds of the series, NaMnO 2 is particularly interesting because the electronic configuration promotes an active Jahn-Teller state and the crystal structure shows that orbital ordering of the Mn 3+ -dz 2 orbitals is already present at room temperature. This strong anisotropy and possible coupling between spin and orbital ordering on a triangular lattice, is uncommon and worth to be investigated. Our previously performed neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data revealed clearly an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering within the Mntriangular lattice despite the prediction of a disordered ground state and Rietveld refinement had shown a unique solution for the magnetic structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The determined magnetic configuration (consists of AFM Mnchains along the b-axis, stacked ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically along the other two triangular directions) leads to an exact cancellation of the nearest-neighbor exchange energy and seems to be associated with a structural distortion to a triclinic cell. To gain further insights into the physics of this system, we studied the evolution of the crystal structure of α-NaMnO 2 in the ID31 beamline. In particular, we aimed to study the low temperature structural transition associated with the 3D magnetic ordering (T N = 45 K) and prove the triclinic distortion, which has been proposed from NPD studies. In addition, probing the evolution of the anisotropic strains is crucial to understand the evolution of 2D magnetic ordering and the magnetoelastic properties of this compound. Six (6) shifts were allocated to our porposal for studying α-NaMnO 2 on the ID31 beamline (λ= 0.39986 Å) as function of temperature. To avoid sample deterioration, powders were sealed in borosilicate glass capillaries under inert atmosphere in a glove-box. High statistics data were collected at selected temperatures, nominally at 5, 30, 60, 100, 200 and 295 K. Intermediate lower statistics scans were performed every 20 K from base and up to room temperature. Additional patterns were collected on cooling and heating from 5 K to 125 K, with temperature steps of 5 K. For the latter, we inserted a small amount of Si powder together with the sample in the capillaries for the purpose of having a better temperature reference. At a second stage, the He-cryostat was replaced by the hot-air blower to study the structure evolution above room temperature, i.e. at 100, 300, 500, 650°C.</p><p>Preliminary Rietveld refinements were performed on the high statistics datasets and are described below. The data were initially modeled at high temperature in the monoclinic phase, C2/m space group (χ 2 : 11.9; R F -factor: 4.35%). After various tests, we realised that the low-T behaviour could be better modeled by two coexisting phases, a monoclinic and a triclinic one (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). We argue that this latter phase originates from a symmetry lowering necessary to lift the magnetic frustration and capable of leading to the observed AFM long-range order (LRO) by NPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Rietveld refinements of the ID31 data with either the monoclinic or the triclinic phase only do not model properly the low-T data (pertain into significant anisotropic peak broadening) leading to poor agreement factors (χ 2 : 10.4; R F -factor: 2.95% and χ 2 : 10.7, R F -factor: 2.64% for the monoclinic only and triclinic only phases, respectively).</p><p>The low-T data do not show any appreciable peak splitting to confirm a clear transition to the triclinic space group symmetry (P-1). However, evidence for the inadequacy of the monoclinic symmetry is offered through observable hk0 anisotropic peak broadening (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). In addition, peak shape asymmetries probably due to defects, such as stacking faults, can also play a role in the not perfect description of the powder pattern. Due the almost 2D structure of the AMO 2 -type compounds, this kind of defect is likely and rather difficult to take into account during the present stage of the data analysis. The use of anisotropic microstrain parameters, based on the Stephen's formulation (S HKL ), significantly improved the single-phase refinements in the whole temperature range. However, even this apporach on its own at low temperature, is not sufficient to account for the large peaks anisotropies observed. We therefore included a second phase, in the triclinic symmetry, attributing it into the the large magneto-elastic coupling for the relief of the strong magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice. This approach resulted in improved overall refinements (χ 2 : 4.83; R F -factor: 2.21% and 2.13% for the monoclinic and triclinic phase, respectively). The volume fractions of the two coexisting microscopic domains have been Rietveld refined up to about 950 K (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>); they show a large change from about 40% for the (frustrated) monoclinic phase at 5 K up to about 90% at 950 K. Below T N we also observed negative lattice thermal expansion both in the a, c (and beta) parameters, while the b lattice size remains almost constant below that temperature (Fig <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). In Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>, large strains in the monoclinic symmetry are observable in the planes perpendicular to the b-direction. Namely, S HKL parameters with non-zero H component are larger and increase upon cooling and especially while one approaches the T N . This behaviour is an important indication that some disorder must take place along the inplane stacking sequence of the AFM Mn-chains.</p><p>It is worth noting that the results described above are preliminary and due to the lack of observable peak splitting as well as the presence of large peak asymmetries, the performed refinements could only give an indication of structural anomalies in the low temperature regime and in particular around T N . The microscopic picture of coexisting domains could indicate the presence of competing 2D (frustrated) and 3D (LRO) spin correlations, with the latter to establish a dominant (triclinic) phase at low temperature. Due to the afore-mentioned structural disorder effects that introduce correlations in the strain as well as in the other two-phase parameters, the proposed model represents a plausible approach to the ID31 data that would require further validation. a) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Monoclinic (C 2/m) Triclinic (P -1) Phase Fraction (%) Temperature (K) b) 0 200 400 600 800 1000 85.5 86.0 86.5 87.0 87.5 88.0 88.5 89.0 89.5 0 200 400 600 800 1000 2.858 2.860 2.862 2.864 2.866 2.868 2.870 b(Å) Temperature (K) Volume (Å 3 ) Temperature (K) Figure 2.
