			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We synthesized the SiOS compound in situ from the elements, high purity Si, S and molecular oxygen, directly in the DAC, with O2 also working as the pressure transmitting medium, PTM, similarly to our recent synthesis of SiS2 in the presence of Ar as the PTM (Wang et al, JCP 2018). Our DACs were equipped with 250-350 mm culet diamonds and Re gasket with an initial hole of typically 100-150 mm diameter and 40-50 mm thickness. We first squeezed S powder between the two diamonds, by closing the DAC with no gasket, and when the cell was open, a few microns thick S layer remained well adherent to one of the diamonds. Subsequently, we squeezed Si powder on top of the S layer by following the same procedure, and we obtained a few microns thick Si layer well adherent to the S layer. The double S/Si layer was covering the entire surface of the diamond. We then carefully removed part of it in order to make the layer approximately round shaped, right in the middle of the diamond culet, with a diameter smaller than the gasket diameter. Finally, we put the gasket between the diamonds and we also inserted one KCl chip and one ruby chip in the sample chamber, well away from the S/Si double layer, in order to measure pressure using both the equation of state of KCl and the ruby fluorescence technique. Liquid O2 was then cryoloaded at 77 K and approximately 1 bar. After loading, the Si/S/O2 sample was compressed at room temperature and powder XRD patterns were measured with pressure steps of 2 GPa, up to about 8 GPa, showing the well known phases of S, Si and O2, respectively. We then gently laser heated the Si/S/O2 sample from the side of S, by using a CW solid state laser at 1064 nm, at the starting pressure of 7.7-8.0 GPa, up to approximately 1000 K or slightly above, in order to melt together and react elemental S, Si and O2. Indeed, at this P-T conditions, all three elements were expected to melt. It was mainly Si that was directly heated up by the NIR laser, subsequently transferring the heat to the attached S layer on one side and to bulk O2 on the opposite side. On the other hand, S and O2 worked as thermal insulating layers for Si. After laser heating, the sample was temperature quenched and XRD patterns were measured. The comparison of measured and DFT predicted XRD patterns revealed that indeed the Cmc21 structure of SiOS was synthesized. Instead, laser heating of the sample from the side of O2 promoted the reaction of Si with O2 with the formation of silica phases rather than the simultaneous reaction of the three elements together. XRD data analysis is presently very preliminary and work is in progress on it.</p></div>
