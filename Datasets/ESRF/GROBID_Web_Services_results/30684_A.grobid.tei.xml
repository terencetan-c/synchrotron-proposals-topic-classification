<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have investigated a series of InAs wire samples grown on InP(111) B at a substrate temperature of 620°C and different deposition times. The wires grow along the [111]B direction, have diameters in the range from 30 to 250 nm, and are typically several µm long, depending on deposition time. It is expected that the wires consist of completely elastically relaxed material, but some alloying with InP could be present. In order to prove an epitaxial relationship between wires and substrate, we recorded reciprocal space maps in GID geometry around the (20-2) Bragg reflection of InP, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> for a sample with 60 s deposition time. The reflections from the InP substrate (at about Q rad =3.035 Å) and InAs (at about Q rad =2.94 Å) are clearly visible. Evaluating the position of the reflections we obtain an in-plane lattice parameter a || of the InAs of 6.046 Å, close to but not exactly that of pure bulk InAs (6.058 Å). Streaks are running in various direction from the InAs Bragg peak: they are due to the side facets of the wires, reflecting the hexagonal wire shape also seen in SEM images. The streaks marked by the red lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> correspond to 〈1-10〉  directions, as expected from previous SEM investigations. However, a second subset of streaks (marked by green lines) is present, which unexpectedly run in 〈11-2〉 directions. They could corresponds to hexagonal wires roated by 30°, but no such wires have ever been observed in SEM. The origin of these streaks remains unclear at the moment.</p><p>In order to obtain information on the InAs content, we measured also the lattice parameter perpendicular to the substrate a ⊥ surface from maps around the (111) reflection. We obtain a ⊥ =6.076 Å, slightly above the value of pure InAs. Considering a || and the elastic constants of bulk InAs a value of a ⊥ =6.065 Å would follow; hence the measured a ⊥ is too large. Alloying with InP would decrease the lattice parameter, so this cannot be the reason for the deviation. However, there are hints from high-resolution TEM that the wires contain a large number of stacking faults, and a part of the wires might eventually grow in the wurtzite rather than the zincblende structure, which is the stable structure for bulk InAs and was also found for epitaxial layers and quantum dots. However, for the wires grown along <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref>, the transition from zincblende to wurtzite only means a change of the stacking sequence from ABCABC to ABAB.</p><p>In order to check the existence of wurtzite InAs, we recorded in-plane maps in GID geometry which are allowed for wurtzite, but forbidden for zincblende. The difference being (in first order) only the stacking sequence leads to a situation where in reciprocal lattice several reflections are identical. With the cubic [111] direction parallel to the hexagonal [001] direction, the wurtzite lattice has in-plane reflections (100) h , (200) h , and (300) h , with the (300) h equivalent to the (4-2-2) c (the subscripts "c" and "h" stand for "cubic" and "hexagonal"). We recorded reciprocal space maps around these reflections, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. One can see only extremely weak reflections from zincblende InP in the first two maps, while very strong Bragg peaks appear from InAs. In the cubic-allowed reflection, scattering from InP is by far stronger than scattering from InAs. This clearly proves that a significant portion of InAs grows in the wurtzite rather than the zincblence lattice structure. Assuming wurtzite structure, from the measured reflections we arrive at lattice parameters a=4.26 Å and c=6.985 Å, which agrees very well with values found in literature for wurtzite InAs [1], suggesting that the majority of wires grows in the wurtzite structure.</p><p>[1] K.
