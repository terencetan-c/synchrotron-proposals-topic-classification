<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The aim of experiment</head><p>The objective of the study is to perform nano-holotomography of human cartilage for a better understanding of the anatomical and physiological factors associated with osteoarthritis (OA). We want to visualize the basic components of the articular cartilage and their arrangement within the tissue in healthy and osteoarthritic specimens extracted from the human knee. The changes induced by OA (involving, for instance, the orientation of collagen fibers, different clustering of the chondrocyte cells and concentration of proteoglycans) will be analyzed. In contrast to conventional histology, where the tissue has to be cut into thin slices, nano-tomography offers a continuous three-dimensional depiction of the complex network of collagen, chondrocytes, and calcifications without breakdown of the tissue. We want to quantify the orientation of the collagen fibrils and their three-dimensional changes during degeneration providing yet unknown information about the exact initiation of degradation. This might clarify the connections between the constituents of articular cartilage, biomechanics, and function and provide a base for developing strategies against early degeneration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment and preliminary Results</head><p>We investigated 6 human osteoarthritic osteochondral plugs, i.e. portions of bone-cartilage tissue extracted from a human knee and provided by the Forensic Medicine Department of the LMU hospital following the regulations of the Ethical Committee of the LMU. Two samples were non-degenerated (healthy cartilage) and four of them were specimens with visual signs of mild OA. Two of them were harvest from the patellar cartilage where as two were from the femoral cartilage. Samples were formalin fixated, embedded in paraffin and cut in cylinders of about 500 microns in diameter and 3 mm in length. We applied X-ray nano-holotomography using 17 keV X-rays. We imaged, using a voxel size of 100 3 (field of view 200 Âµm), three different regions along the height of the cartilage tissue (one region per cartilage zone). In Figure 2 a non-degenerated (control, bottom) and a degenerated (top) samples are shown. Both 3D reconstructed sets come from the supertangential zone of the cartilage. In A and B the fiber bundles are visible and are oriented in horizontal and vertical direction. The chondrocytes are sparsely distributed. Dark spots are visible in the lower part of the sagittal image. In C and D the chondrocytes are visible but not a clear bundle structure. The chondrocytes are mostly oriented in the vertical direction (D). Dark spots appear but only around and inside the chondrocytes.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The three zones of healthy articular cartilage (deep-radial zone, middle-transizional zone, and superficial-tangential zone), including orientation and arrangement of collagen fibers and chondrocytes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion:</head><p>In the non-degenerated samples (control) fiber bundles could not be clearly depicted. Though there are darker parts of the interterritorial matrix, they cannot clearly be identified as fiber structures as we are able to in the degenerated cartilage of the patella. The chondrocytes in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> do not show a circular structure but a triangular one, this might be a sign of degradation or resulting from cutting the sample (sign of deformation). The appearance of the dark spots is unclear, where they are coming from. We don't know if this comes from the samples themselves, e.g. age dependent calcifications or the preparation of those, e.g. some kind of precipitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The data has a very high quality and shows structural details of the cartilage. More post processing with this data needs to be done to get meaningful medical information and knowledge. Investigations need to be done to understand the appearance of the dark spots and the deformation of chondrocytes. We like to continue this study at ID16A with a different protocol in sample preparation and handling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical comments:</head><p>This second experiment was very successful. We need to optimize the sample preparation and treatment for future measurements. Technically-wise, the experiment did not encounter any major problems.</p></div>			</div>
