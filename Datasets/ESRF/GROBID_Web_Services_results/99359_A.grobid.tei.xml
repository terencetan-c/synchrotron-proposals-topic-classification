<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Perovskite SrCoO3 is a ferromagnetic material with a transition at 250K. Theoretical calculation claim it is a negative charge transfer material that the Co atoms are mainly in d 6 high spin state. A previous transport study shows that SrCoO3 thin film will undergo a metal to insulator (MIT) transition, by applying tensile strain from 1% to 3% with different substrates <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Interestingly, its ferromagnetic property is not affected during the MIT transition. This robust FM order is unexpected considering that the spin state is correlated with the charge state. We proposed to use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at Co L3-edge (~ 780 eV) to study the three-dimensional spin excitations in strain-engineering SrCoO3 on various substrates. The results will help to uncover the underlying spin mechanisms of SrCoO3 and provide valuable information on how to realize novel functionalities via stain engineering.</p><p>We prepared 4 samples for this beam time: three SrCoO3 thin films on substrate La0.3Sr0.7Al0.65Ta0.35O3 (LSAT), SrTiO3 (STO), and DyScO3 (DSO), and a Sr2Co2O5 thin film on substrate LSAT for comparison. We performed XAS at O K and Co L edge to determine the resonant energy. Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) was performed at Co L3 edge (~780eV). The energy resolution of our measurements was about 30 meV with an exagap of 15 and 50 meV with an exagap of 30. The scattering plane approximately went along 111 and 101 directions.</p><p>We have performed energy detuning measurements on SrCoO3/LSAT and Sr2Co2O5. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>) shows the energy detuning measurement on SCO/LSAT at 25K and 270K. We can clearly see several Raman features at ~0.07 eV, 0.4-1.0 eV, and 1.5 eV at 25K, and the Raman features at 0.4-1.0 eV redistribute at 270K. Additionally, we can observe fluorescence features emerging from the resonant energy. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>) compares directly the spectra at low and high temperatures. We notice that the intensity around 0.07eV increases significantly at high temperatures.</p><p>We also measured the momentum and polarization dependence on SrCoO3/LSAT at 25K and 270K. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref> shows the momentum dependence in the 111 and 101 directions. We do not see any dispersive features. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(e) shows the spectra measured with different polarizations of the incident beam, which look very similar between horizontal and vertical polarizations. We also measured the strain dependence on SrCoO3 from 1% to 3%, as shown in Figure (f). They have similar features between 0.4 eV and 1.0 eV with a small intensity difference To understand these results, we have performed multiplet ligand-field theory calculations with parameters estimated from DFT calculations <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(g) shows the energy level diagram versus the crystal parameter 10Dq. The colors of the lines indicate the possibility of 1/2 (red), 3/2 (green), and 5/2 (blue) spin. The spin state results from the competition of the crystal field and the Hund rule, which is sensitive to the parameters used in the calculation. Our calculated spectra are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(h</ref>, <ref type="figure">i</ref>) with high and low spin initial states respectively. These results correspond to RIXS spectra at low and high temperatures. Our calculations suggest a high spin ground state at low temperature and partly occupants at low spin excited states at high temperature by thermal excitation. References: [1] Wang, Y. et al.
