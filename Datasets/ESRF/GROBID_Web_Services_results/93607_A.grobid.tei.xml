<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As expected, the local structure from 1 to ~4.3 Å is very similar for embryonic samples and the amorphous (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). However, the peak at around 5 Å seems better resolved and intense in the embryonic zeolites. This Si-O distance occurs between at least three tetrahedra, thus it is possible that in embryonic zeolites the probability of finding this distance is higher, may mining more tetrahedra involved (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In addition, from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we can observe a different dampening of the signal, with a slightly faster decrease for the amorphous. This is a good indication that embryonic zeolites have a longer coherent correlation length, (i.e. longer short range order).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. On the left panel, distance Si-O =5.03 Å is highlighted, this distance can exist if at least three tetrahedra are positioned as reported, but more tetrahedra can be involved even, in theory, forming a pentagon (right panel).</p><p>Considerations reported point out that the local structure of embryonic zeolites can be described with a peculiar atomic arrangement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">EZ-MFI samples doped with different samples</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows a qualitative comparison of EZ-MFI samples with similar Si/Al ratio, but with different doping. The first sample is not doped, while the last four present the 5 wt % of MnO3, CuO, Fe3O4 and ZnO, respectively. Unfortunately, for all samples, the first distance metal-oxygen, which is around 1.9-2 Å, is hidden by the noise (i.e. termination ripples). The local structure appears similar for all samples up to around 5.5 Å, indeed, despite some variations in the intensity, the positions of the peaks are almost the same. Above 5.5 Å, instead, small differences can be observed. Future analysis will be performed by EPSR software to give quantitative results on the local structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
