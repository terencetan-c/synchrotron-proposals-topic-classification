<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives and methodology:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was the in situ measurement of the strain anisotropy in crystalline ice during their mechanical deformation (see proposal). We started with the simplest case, i.e. single crystal samples. The crystals were firstly illuminated with a white beam, and several reflections were recorded on a film (White beam topography). The reflections were indexed and one or two of them were chosen to be analysed with the rocking curve imaging (RCI) method. This method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has a higher strain sensitivity and reveals the lattice plane distortion. The experiment was performed in Laue (transmission) geometry, compatible with the sample environment (cryostat, compression device). However the Laue geometry implies further technical and analytical problems: a RCI scan measures one of the two vectorial components of the lattice misorientation. In the case of Bragg (reflection) geometry the second component is usually measured in a second scan where the sample is reoriented in a way such that the diffracting lattice planes turn by 90 • <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In Laue geometry this would turns to be usually unfeasible because the X-ray beam would have to go through very large (centimeter) material thickness. An alternative way to measure the second component is based on the measurement of the spatial deflection of the diffracted beam associated to this second component. Fig. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> illustrates the way a lattice distortion perpendicular to the incoming beam deflects the diffracted beam. <ref type="formula">1</ref>) left: the X-ray beam is diffracted by an undistorted lattice plane if the Bragg equation is fullfiled; centre: the component of the diffraction vector parallel to beam does not deflect the diffracted beam, however the beam is diffracted under a different incoming angle; right: the component of the diffraction vector perpendicular to the beam nearly does not modify the incoming angle under which the beam is diffracted, however the diffracted beam is deflected. The deflection can be measured on a 2d detector (camera)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">! || h rocking axis (a) (b) (c) diffraction plane undistorted (reference) lattice plane distorted lattice plane h 0 k 0 k h diffraction plane k h k 0 ! ! || k 0 h ! Figure (</formula><p>In addition dispersive effects of the beam have to be taken into account because they locally shift the Bragg peak. The angular and wavelength dispersion was calibrated with the aid of additional RCI scans of a perfect Si crystal. These experiments about dispersive effects on a synchrotron radiation diffraction topography transmission experiment were performed as inhouse research, and are being processed to be published .</p><p>To measure both the rocking curve images and their deflection we used a grid providing multiple 50µm x 50µm dot beams, separated by one millimetre, over more than 1 cm 2 . This means that for a scan of entire sample 20 x 20 = 400 RCI scans should be performed, a task that would require a huge amount of beamtime. In addition, over such a long time, the temperature stability of the sample cannot be retained. We therefore restricted the scans to smaller zones, which were repeated after each compression of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Results:</head><p>The analysis of the lattice distortion in depth of the single crystal is in progress, but is not advanced enough to be presented here. This analysis is a necessary step before going to the more interesting, but difficult, tricrystal case. Some preliminary results showing the entire image (spatially extended beam), whereas not providing the wished quantitative information about the sample lattice misorientation in depth, are nevertheless presented her because they constitute a first approach, allowing a qualitative   2mm compression axis</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>analysis, of what is happening in the crystal during its deformation.
