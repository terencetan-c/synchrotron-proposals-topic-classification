<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to determine the unknown until now lattice dynamics of Nd by measuring the phonon dispersion branches by grazing-incidence inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) on an epitaxial Nd film and comparing the experimental data with the results from the ab initio calculations. Applying the growth conditions described by Soriano et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> single crystalline Nd(0001) film with a thickness of 1.0 Î¼m was grown on a 25 nm thick Nb(110) buffer layer deposited on (11-20)Al 2 O 3 (A-plane) substrate. After characterization by electron diffraction the film was covered by 10 nm thick Nb layer to protect the reactive Nd metal from oxidation. The film was additionally characterized by XRD that confirmed the formation of high quality dhcp Nd(0001). The presence of about 10% fcc Nd phase has also been found. Recently the lattice dynamics of Sm exhibiting the native 9R (Sm-type) structure has been determined by nuclear inelastic scattering and first principles theory and compared with that of the dhcp Sm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A remarkable broadening of the longitudinal phonon mode has been observed in experiment that, however, was not found in the calculations. In order to shed more light on this phenomenon, additionally to the dhcp Nd, we have measured phonon dispersion relations in dhcp Sm film and compared the results to that of Nd. For the purpose of this study a growth procedure for obtaining high-quality epitaxial dhcp Sm(0001) on Nb(110) buffered (11-20)Al 2 O 3 was established. After the growth and characterization the 500 nm thick Sm film was covered by 10 nm Nb and studied by XRD.</p><p>The IXS experiment was performed at ID28 of the ESRF with an enery resolution of 2.0 meV. All energy scans were measured at room temperature.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Measured phonon branches for the Nd and Sm films in the q x ,q y -projection in the reciprocal space.</p><p>The experiment was performed in grazing incidence geometry that made imposible to map the phonon dispersions along high symmetry directions. All measured branches exhibited an offset in the q z direction.</p><p>The measured phonon paths in the reciprocal space projected to the q x -q y -plane for Nd and Sm are shown with solid red/lines in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The high symmetry points in q x -q y plane of the reciprocal space are also indicated.</p><p>Selected phonon branches for dhcp Nd(0001) and dhcp Sm(0001) films compared with the corresponding ab initio calculation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, respectively.  . This splitting was not predicted by the theory and could be attributed to the electron-electron correlations that were not included in the calculations. Firstprinciples calculations applying the LDA+U method that will account for the electron correlations effect are presently on-going.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2 Measured and calculated phonon branches for dhcp Nd (paths a),b),c) and d), Fig1).
