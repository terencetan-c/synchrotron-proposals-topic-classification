<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have engineered lipid nanoparticles with an internal bicontinuous cubic structure with large pore structures and controllable internal connectivity. To use them for applications such as drug encapsulation and synthetic self-contained enzymatic microreactors it was essential to first understand their structural response to temperature, pressure and physiological conditions. In addition to this we have used salts with high X-ray contrast to probe the connectivity of the internal aqueous networks to their external environment. Lipid cubic nanoparticle dispersions were formed via sonication using ternary lipid mixtures of monoolein, cholesterol and charged lipids DOTAP, DOPA, DOPS or DOPG in the presence of the pluronic block copolymer F-127. To charactise their structural response to temperature and presssure we investigated the structural changes between 25°C and 55°C in 10°C steps, performing pressure scans at each temperature. Analysis is currently ongoing, however we have summarised the results of three samples containing 5mol% of charged lipid. For each composition, changes in lattice parameter have been shown as a function of temperature (T) and pressure (P) and preliminary P-T phase diagrams have been constructed. Notably all changes in lattice parameter and phase coexistences were reversible. Sample diffraction patterns showing Im3m -HII coexistence (atmospheric pressure) and pure Im3m at 37.6°C at 200 MPa are shown below.</p><p>0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2 0.001 0.011 0.021 0.031 0.041 Intensity S (Å -1 ) atmospheric pressure 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 0.001 0.011 0.021 0.031 0.041 Intensity S (Å -1 )</p></div>		</body>

Cubosome samples were prepared in concentrated KI, KCl, CsCl or NaCl and diluted into a different salt to study the structural changes due to the ionic interactions. Analysis is still ongoing for this data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of Results</head><p>At 25°C and atmospheric pressure, all three ternary lipid cubosome dispersion mixtures exhibit pure Im3m phase morphology with little change upon a pressure increase of 200 MPa. As the temperature increases all three samples exhibit an Im3m -HII mixture, which upon increasing pressure converts to a pure Im3m phase at pressures and temperatures specific to the composition. The reduction of the proportion of HII phase, leads to a significant swelling of the Im3m phase. In addition to the swelling of the cubic phase due to a reduction in the HII phase, a pressure increase of 200 MPa appears to swell the cubic phase at temperatures above 25°C. We are currently investigating this behaviour in the data taken for other mixtures. This is the first study of the effects of temperture and pressure in highly swollen dispersed lipid nanoparticles. The observed swelling of the cubic phase and changes in phase morphology are in good agreement with the behaviour of swollen mixtures of bulk cubic phase. These studies have enabled us to systematically study the kinetics of swelling of these cubosome systems we will enable ourselves and other researchers to manufacture cubosomes for targeted drug encapsulation and delivery, significantly accelerating this field of research. </p></div>			</div>
