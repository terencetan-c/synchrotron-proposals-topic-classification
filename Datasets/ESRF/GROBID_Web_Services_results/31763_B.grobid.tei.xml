<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have measured fully refinable high resolution diffraction patterns at 15K for 8 compositions of the superconductive oxide Y 1-x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O y (0.0≤x≤1.0), which have been synthesised in our laboratory. The Y 1-x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O y (YPr123) compound is the most puzzling one among all other superconducting cuprates, the mechanism, which suppresses superconductivity when Pr substitutes for Y, remaining still obscure. Different mechanisms such as hole filling, pair breaking, hybridisation as well as Pr partial substitution for Ba have not found complete justification from the different experimental results. In addition the role of Pr induced structural and electronic inhomogeneities, which manifest themselves by the formation of three subphases, as evidenced from our Raman spectroscopy results, needs further examination. Such phase separation effects are expected to correlate with microstructural characteristics and lattice distortions. The purpose of our experiments was to systematically investigate the subtle structural and microstructural changes in the solid solution by using Synchrotron High Resolution Powder Diffraction data in combination with Raman spectroscopy results. We have investigated the correlation of any microstrustural as well as any local structural changes induced by Pr doping in Y123 with spectral modifications of the Raman-active phonons and the reduction in T c . The role of Pr substitution for Ba was also investigated based on the results obtained by both methods. In our initial proposal for beamline ID31, we planed to measure fully refinable diffraction patterns at both 5K and RT for the 16 compositions available. Due to the different characteristics of beamline BM01, where we have performed the experiments, it was possible to measure during the available time only 8 compositions, covering the doping range x=0.0-1.0, only at one temperature (T=15K). The XRD patterns (collected at λ=0.60008Å with a 0.7mm-diameter quarzt capillary for a 2θ range 0.5-45.5 o ) were refined using the GSAS suite of Rietveld analysis programms in the orthorhombic space group Pmmm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The diffraction lines were modeled by a pseudo-Voigt function with axial divergence aymmetry corrections and the microstrain broadening description of P. Stephens (J. <ref type="bibr">Appl. Cryst.,32,281 (1999)</ref> (CW profile function 4 in GSAS). The secondary phase BaCuO 2 indicative of the presence of Pr/Ba antisite defects was included in the refinement. The isotropic thermal factors for all atoms and the Pr/Ba antisite defects have been also separetly refined. Based on the up to now analysis of our XRD data, the following new results have been obtained: Microstructural characteristics ----Anisotropic broadening of Bragg peaks, the 00l reflections beeing sharper than the hkl ones (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), is evident in the XRD patterns for the whole composition range. This indicates that lattice distortions are predominent in the basal a-b plane. Microstrains along the caxis, calculated from the refined Stephens coeffisients, are two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding along the a and b axis, in consinstance with the high anisotropy of the Y123 material. Microstrains seem to increase with Pr doping. However, for compositions 0.3≤x≤0.8 microstrains remain almost constant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, dashed lines are guide to the eye). For the same compositional range the size of the presumably spherical coherently diffractiong domains estimated from the Lorenztian contribution to broadening L x according to P(μm)=(180/π)•(0.9λ/L x 100) show minimum values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). The origin of anisotropic peak broadening is still a subject of further investigations. The evolution of the microstructural features with Pr doping correlates with the observed by Raman spectroscopy development of three bands, attributed to three subphases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), allthough no direct evidence has been found up to now by the XRD results of phase separation effects. Structural characteristics ---The a and b lattice parameters are linearly increasing (the orthorhombic strain remaining allmost constant in the whole compositional range) with nominal Pr content x, in accordance with the bigger Pr replacing the smaller Y ion. On the contrary, the c lattice parameter does not show a significant change. A systematic increase of the in-plain Cu pl -O pl bonds and the Pr-O pl bonds is observed following the increase of the a,b, lattice constants. Pr/Ba antisite defects are systematically increasing (up to 13% per Ba atom) upon Pr doping (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). An increase of the isotropic atomic displacement factor at the Ba site upon Pr doping has been also observed. 0 10 20 30 40 50 [110] microstrain (δd/d)x10 4 [100] [010] [001]</p><p>(a) 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 (b) Size P (μm) Pr content x nominal 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 Pr content x 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Relative intensities 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 -0.02 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 Pr/Ba antisite defects % Pr content x nominal   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 Example of Rietveld fit of orthorhombic (Pmmm) Y123 at 15K (ΒΜ01, λ=0.60008Å) χ 2 =2.79, R wp =12.21%, R F 2 =3.23% Fig. 2: 020, 006 and 020 reflections for Y 0.55 Pr 0.45 Ba 2 Cu 3 O y at 15K</figDesc><graphic coords="2,357.24,261.96,192.84,127.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
