<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Investigation of the vanadium surrounding in VAlON catalysts by XANES and EXAFS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Vanadium-aluminium-oxy-nitrides, VAlON, systems are active catalysts in the ammoxidation of propane for the production of acrylonitrile (ACN). The VAlON catalysts are made in two steps. First a vanadiumaluminium-oxide precursor, VAlO is prepared via the co-precipitation of NH 4 VO 3 and Al(NO 3 ) 3 . After drying in air, this oxide precursor is nitrided with NH 3 at 500°C, to form the VAlON. The following parameters have an influence on the ACN selectivity: 1) The V/Al ratio in the co-precipitation solution, 2) The drying temperature of the oxide precursor, 3) The nitridation procedure. The nitridation can be performed as a pre-treatment before introduction in a catalytic reactor ("ex-situ samples"); or can be performed during reaction ("in-situ samples"); the VAlO is then introduced in the catalytic reactor and becomes a VAlON during reaction, which takes place under a mixture of ammonia, propane and oxygen. The catalyst with the highest selectivity is obtained with a V/Al ratio of 0.25, dried at 60°C and nitrided during reaction. These differences in catalytic properties might be related to the V-structure in the powder catalyst. The goal of this experiment was therefore to determine the local structure around the V-atoms in the VAlO and VAlON. Samples are noted as VAlO(0.XX) and VAlON(0.XX), with 0.XX being the V/Al ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>V K-edge spectra were recorded in transmission mode at the XAS station of the DUBBLE beamline (BM26A). Ex-situ samples were recorded at room temperature in air. A chemical cell, constructed at the Department Solid State Sciences of the Ghent University (Belgium), was used for the in-situ nitridation at 500°C in 5%NH 3 /He and for the in-situ calcination study of VAlO(0.25) and VAlON(0.9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The VAlO precursor</head><p>The XANES spectra for VAlO(0.25) and VAlO(0.9) are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The vanadium in the oxide precursors is in the V 5+ oxidation state and is tetrahedrally co-ordinated with oxygen. The XANES spectra for the oxide precursors resemble the one for NH 4 VO 3 very well. This reference compound has a tetrahedral "VO4" co-ordination with two vanadyl bonds (V=O) and two single V-O bonds. This structure is chosen as initial guess in the EXAFS fits. The k 1 -weighted Fourier Transform (FT) spectra for experiment and fit and the resulting structural model is proposed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The two oxide precursors have the same tertrahedral coordination. For the VAlO(0.9) a V-V contribution at 3.2 Å is present. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-situ nitridation</head><p>The nitridation of a VAlO(0.25) and a VAlO(0.9) was followed with in-situ XAS. The oxide precursor is first heated from room temperature to 500°C in 5%NH 3 /He and kept at this temperature for up to 10 hours. XAS spectra were taken during heating and at 500°C after different nitridation times.</p><p>The XANES spectra showed that the pre-edge peak intensity diminishes strongly during nitridation. This means that we pass from a tetrahedral co-ordination to an octahedral one. The structural changes already started during heating and are almost completed at 500°C. A fit of the EXAFS spectra after full nitridation was possible. The resulting FT structural model is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The ligands of the octahedron are O or N. As the two atoms are neighbouring elements in the Periodic Table <ref type="table">they</ref> have similar scattering properties for EXAFS, which makes it difficult to differentiate between N and O with this technique.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The VAlO(N) system</head><p>The drying temperature of the oxide precursor before nitridation has an influence on the ACN selectivity. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> the EXAFS spectra for three VAlON(0.25) samples with drying temperatures of 60, 120 and 500°C are compared with the oxide precursor and the fully nitrided oxy-nitride. The VAlON were obtained after nitridation during reaction in NH 3 /O 2 /C 3 H 6 . The EXAFS spectra can be seen as a linear combination of the spectra for the oxide precursor and the fully nitrided sample. The structure of the VAlON(0.25) is a mixture of the oxide precursor tetrahedrae and the oxy-nitride octahedrae. The corresponding percentages octaedrae are indicated on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. So it seems that during reaction a mixture of the oxide precursor tetrahedrae and oxy-nitride octahedrae is present. The ratio tetrahedrae/octahedrae may explain the chemical selectivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication/Presentation</head><p>The first results of this study were already presented on a Belgian national symposium on the use of synchrotron radiation.
