<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Context and objectives The experiment MD-1114 aims at determining the nature of chemical interactions of 20 nm metal oxysulfide nanoparticles of composition Gd 2-x Ce x O 2 S (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with macrophages. These nanoparticles are being developed in our team in a safe-by-design approach. In particular, we study their toxicity in parallel with their performance as potential photocatalysts. To evaluate their toxicity, we exposed murine macrophage to the nanoparticles. Results in metabolic activity assay showed a high dose-dependent toxicity on some samples containing cerium. In the experiment at ID21 beamline, we performed µXRF and µXAS at two absorption edges (Ce L 3 -edge, Gd L 3 -edge) to localize the nanoparticles in the cells and identify the oxidation state of cerium (III or IV) in this biological environment. Such an approach will provide crucial information that will help us to understand the potential toxicity of these emerging nanoparticles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental section</head><p>Murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line) were grown on Si 3 N 4 membrane windows and exposed to Gd 2-x Ce x O 2 S nanoparticles at 10 µg/ml. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and the samples were snap-frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The Si 3 N 4 membrane windows were then stored in 24-well plates cooled at -80 °C in a freezer or with dry ice. Non-exposed cells and free nanoparticles were also prepared as reference. Cryogenic experiments were carried out at beamline ID21 in a vacuum chamber passively cooled at ca -130 °C by liquid nitrogen. The Si 3 N 4 membrane windows were mounted on a pre-cooled copper sample holder in liquid nitrogen and were rapidly inserted into the vacuum chamber. Measurements at Gd L 3 -edge were carried out first. µXRF maps were acquired with an incoming energy of 7.4 keV with 0.5 µm 2 steps and an integration time of 100-150 ms. µXAS spectra were recorded at different points in the maps to compare with free nanoparticles. Energy of the beam was then set to 5.8 keV at Ce L 3 -edge. XRF and XAS hyperspectral (fluoXAS) maps were recorded in areas presenting high nanoparticles concentrations near the cells. Reference sample on Si 3 N 4 membrane RF8-200-52454-17 purchased from AXO DRESDEN GmbH was used for quantification of elements. To calculate weight fractions, the thickness of the cells and the density of the medium were estimated at 15 µm and 1 g/ml respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We were able to visualize cryofixed macrophages exposed to the nanoparticles with potassium mapping (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Potassium is better distributed inside the cells than phosphorus and its XRF signal is also more intense. Therefore, potassium is a better cell marker for our experiments. Gadolinium maps of the samples show that aggregates of Gd 2-x Ce x O 2 S nanoparticles are partly located outside the cells. Smaller aggregates were also detected on and/or in the cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>). The nanoparticles that contain cerium with x as low as 0.2 can be visualized with cerium mapping as well (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). Cerium is co-located with gadolinium in the aggregates. Weight fraction of gadolinium was plotted against that of cerium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>). The observed trend is consistent with the expected Gd/Ce ratio measured by Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled to Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Few points farther from the black line represent aggregates that contain slightly less Ce. They suggest a possible degradation of the nanoparticles. We then look at the speciation of gadolinium and cerium using µXANES. Spectra at Gd L 3 -edge of the aggregates show no significant modification compared to those of nanoparticles in water (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>). At Ce L 3 -edge, fluoXAS maps of the samples that have high toxicity towards metabolic activity of the cells were recorded. Preliminary results indicate modification of oxidation state of cerium inside some aggregates in contact with the cells. However, this trend was not observed for all the samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>For the first time, we employed µXRF to visualize macrophages exposed to metal oxysulfide nanoparticles of composition Gd 2-x Ce x O 2 S (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). Aggregates of nanoparticles were detected partly outside the cells but also on and/or in the cells. Leaching of cerium seems to be present in some aggregates. Complementary elemental analyses will be done to confirm this degradation of nanoparticles in biological media. The results of fluoXAS mapping at Ce L 3 -edge demonstrated that modification of oxidation state of cerium in contact with the cells can be observed even though not systematic.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): CARENCO Sophie*, LCMCP-CNRS UMR7574-Université Pierre et Marie Curie CHANEAC Corinne*, LCMCP-CNRS UMR7574-Université Pierre et Marie Curie LANONE Sophie*, IMRB-INSERM U955 NGUYEN Anh-Minh*, LCMCP-CNRS UMR7574-Université Pierre et Marie Curie and IMRB-INSERM U955 Report:</figDesc></figure>
