<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by heptahelical transmembrane receptors is a common theme at the start of many signal transduction pathways. One such pathway, in the vertebrate retina, starts when rhodopsin absorbs a photon causing transducin Ga to bind GTP and dissociate from transducin Qy. Transducin Ga-GTP then activates cGMP phosphodiesterase leading to a drop in the concentration of cGMP closing certain cation channels. The intrinsic hydrolysis of transducin Ga-GTP to Ga-GDP leads Ga-G@P to reassociate with transducin Py ready for the cycle to start again. Phosducin regulates this cycle. Upon exposure to light phosducin is dephosphorylated on Ser 73 and subsequentley binds to transducin Qy, this prevents transducin py from binding to Ga-GDP, and so the inactive Ga-GDP cannot be reactivated by the receptor.</p><p>-</p><p>In collaboration with l?rof. YeeXin Ho (University of Illinois, Chicago), one of us (A.L.) has developed a purification and crystallization procedure for the phosducin/transducin Py complex from bovine retina. Although the complex is quite tight phosducin is an unstable protein, which is rapidly degraded if isolated from the complex, The inherent instability of the phosducin as well as post-translational medications, such as a famesyl moiety at the C-terminal end of the transducin y-subunit make the complex difficult to handle and unstable. After extensive crystallization trials the quality of crystals has improved markedly and crystal growth conditions were found which allowed crystals to be frozen. However, heavy atom trials both on a home source and using the synchrotron radiation source at Daresbury have not, to date, yielded a good heavy atom derivative (even crystals grown in the presence of heavy atoms appeared not to have high levels of substitution). The table, below, summarizes the data collection statistics of the best three datasets collected on beam-line D2AM (several other datasets were collected on phosducinltransducin Py crystals on D2AM but they were not of such good quality).</p><p>Dataset name Cell dimensions Resolution &amp;erae (%) Native 76.1 87.9 98.7A 2.8A 8.0 Gold 75.9 89.3 108.5A 3.OA 10.0 Platinum 76.1 89.1 106.4A 3.OA 6-9</p><p>The overall completness of the dataset varies from 85.5 to 93.2%. The data collected on D2AM are of much better quality than data collected elswhere and made the structure determination possible (e.g. the best dataset collected elsewhere, had data to only 3.5A and an Rmerge of 10.7% -from five crystals at room temperature at Daresbury). [Note an attempt to collect a MAD dataset on a crystal grown in the presence of Irridium was not successful; during alignment the crystal appeared to move out of the cryo-stream and stopped diffracting.] The determination of the crystal structures of two heterotrimeric G proteins, Gia&amp;y2 <ref type="bibr">(Wall et al., 1995) and</ref><ref type="bibr">transducin, Gtc@ (Lambright et al., 1996)</ref> reported in December 199YJanuary 1996, meant that we were able to locate the transducin Py part (some 411 ammo acids) of the phosducin/transducin py complex by molecular replacement (using coordinates from <ref type="bibr">Walls et al., 1995)</ref>. Cross-crystal averaging between the close&amp; related cells allowed us to identify the backbone of the phosducin subunit (245 ammo acids), however, the electron density maps were difficult to interpret for the phosducin subunit. Refinement of the bovine retinal phosducin/transducin Py complex is continuing and the structure currently has an R (Rfree) of 30.5% (35.5%) and includes 572 ammo acids The absence of a substantial part of the structure from the starting molecular replacement model has made the refinement time consuming and difficult (only some 330 amino acids of the transducin Py subunits were well defined in the molecular replacement solution). Unfortunately, from our point of view, another group, whom we did not know were working on the structure reported the crystal structure of a phosducin/ transducin by complex in November 1996 <ref type="bibr">(Gaudet et al., 1996)</ref>, they had used recombinant material and did not have the c-terminal modification on the y subunit.</p><p>To conclude, the use of beamline D2AM et the ESRF enabled us to collect 2.8A data on crystals of bovine retinal phosducin/transducin Py. Unfortunatley the inherent instabilty of the crystals/complex was problematic in obtaining good derivative and or MAD data. We hope to report our crystal structure in the near future. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Gaudet, R., Bohm, A., Sigler,'P.B. (19%) Cell, 87,577-588.
