<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performed experiments</head><p>The following film compositions were tested:</p><p>• Polyurethane film • Polyurethane/Polyacrylate hybrid film with 50/50 weight ratio between the components • Polyurethane/Polyacrylate hybrid film with 70/30 weight ratio between the components • Polyurethane/Polyacrylate hybrid film with 90/10 weight ratio between the components In a typical in-situ experiment: a thick colloidal film was mounted in an aluminium humidity chamber. Then the film was exposed either to water vapor or EtOH vapor. The air flow rate was set at 20 l/h. The swelling of the material was ongoing for ~70 min followed by drying with the same dry air flow rate for additional ~70 min.</p><p>The swelling and deswelling of the material was followed with GISAXS using 6 different angles (0; 0.06°; 0.09°; 0.12°; 0.2°; 0.5°) in order to gain insights about the materials' morphology at different penetration depths.</p><p>Moreover we have tested also the following ex-situ samples:</p><p>• Polyurethane films, that were casted under various environmental conditions; before and after water exposure • Polyurethane/Polyacrylate hybrid film with 50/50 weight ratio between the components, that were casted under various environmental conditions; before and after water exposure • Polyurethane/Polyacrylate blended film with 50/50 weight ratio between the components, that were casted under various environmental conditions; before and after water exposure Results 1) Generally, the experiments were all successful. We have been able to follow the structural changes upon swelling. Also, the experimental set-up allowed us to gain information simultaneously on both the bulk and the surface of the film. It was shown that in case of the PU the EtOH vapor significantly damages the surface of the film. When PAc is present, the film quality also get worse and the PAc domains' spacing changes but no significant surface damage occurs. 2) It was shown that the extent of surface damage upon water exposure is influenced by the preparation (drying) conditions of the PU films.</p><p>3) We observed that in the hybrid and blended films structural rearrangement occurs upon solvent exposure. Moreover, the films' behaviour is influenced by the film casting conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The aim of the proposal was achieved. Successful measurements of the effect of water and EtOH swelling on the surface structure of soft PU-based coatings were performed. Further analysis of the data is currently ongoing which will allow us to extract more information about the systems. We foresee that thiese data will be part of a future publication and will be inserted in the PhD thesis of Gabor Ersek.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional comments</head><p>During the in-situ experiments we observed that the total intensity of the images change during the electron injection process (refill). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the total image intensity normalized by the incoming beam intensity as obtained without any samples in the beam, namely only measuring the air background. The jump in intensity occurred at the time of the injection and could not be normalized. Moreover after the jump the intensity does not stay constant, but a slow decay can be observed. This may point to a problem with the photodiode used in the beamstop or the ionization chamber. We will work closely with the beamline staff to address this problem in the future. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: set of images obtained during EtOH exposure, and subsequent drying</figDesc><graphic coords="2,171.77,422.07,257.45,226.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
