<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Purpose The aim of this experiment was to identify and localize the arsenic degradation products in various types of binding media using XANES and energy mapping. This research aims to demonstrate the role of the binding media and the type of pigment (natural or artificial) on the degradation process of arsenic sulfide pigments (As 2 S 3 , orpiment, As 4 S 4 , realgar and g-As xx S yy ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>After optimizing the analytical conditions (slit position, beam size, alignment, …), we started with measuring reference samples of both natural pigments (orpiment and realgararsenic sulfides) and potential degradation products (pararealgar, arsenic (V) sulphide, potassium arsenate (arsenic V), arsenic (III) oxide, arsenic (V) oxide and arsenic 0 ) to assess the possibility to differentiate these compounds. Then, naturally aged samples from 1) a Japanse tower in Brussels, Belgium, 2) an Egyptian canopic jar from the Royal Museum of Art and History, Brussels, Belgium, 3) a 17 th -18 thcentury "Chinoiserie" from a private collection, and 4) a 17 th -century Dutch painting samples (Seghers) from the National Gallery of Denmark were analysed. Four energy maps (pre-and post-edge as well as arsenic (III) and arsenic (V) white lines) and XANES line scans were performed on each samples in order to locate and visualise the degradation phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>From the analyses of the reference materials, four different energies were observed for the different arsenic oxidation states: 11.868 (As 0 ), 11.869 (As +3 sulphides), 11.871 (As +3 oxides) and 11.875 keV (As +5 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.). The some of the energy differences between the different oxidation states were too small to choose them all and so, two energies characteristic for non-degraded arsenic sulphide (11.869 keV) and degraded arsenic sulphate (11.875 keV) were selected and used for energy mapping on the historical samples. Two other energies (pre-and post-edge energies at 11.860 and 11.92 keV respectively) were also selected for the energy maps.</p><p>While the XANES spectra obtained for both the reference materials and the historical samples were quite noisy, it was still possibleas shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> to identify different white lines for the non-degraded and degraded materials. In the first part of the experiment, several spectra were acquired for short amount of time (zap mode) in order to maximize the signal to noise ratio (S/N) but, the noise appearing to be systematic (with no improvement of S/N), another approach with a single spectrum was chosen for the last sample (scan mode) with better S/N than with previous mode. Since the flux of the beamline being too low to allow the use of the I 0 detector, the normalisation of the XANES spectra was done using the sum intensity of the Fe Kα lines. Before starting the analyses on historical samples, multiple consecutive spectra were acquired to see if the analyses induced degradation, but no difference was observed between them. On the historical samples, it was also possible to differentiate and localize non-degraded arsenic sulphide and degraded arsenate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Differences were observed in the degradation based on the medium: pigment in lacquer showed a lower level or no degradation compared to pigment in oil. The data still has to be analysed more in depth and/or processed in the hope of getting more information on the historical samples.  pt1 pt2 pt3 a b</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2.
