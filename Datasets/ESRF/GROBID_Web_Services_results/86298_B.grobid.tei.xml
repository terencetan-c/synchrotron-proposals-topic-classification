<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the allocated beamtime, we aimed to evaluated the effect of shear on blends of thermotropic polyesters dispersed in a polyester matrix, including polycaprolactone and polypentadecalactone. The experiments were prospected to be performed in a multi-pass rheometer, providing excellent control over shear, shear rate on the samples. Unfortunately, malfunctioning of the MPR device prevented us from performing the proposed experiments. Instead, the samples were mounted in the Linkam Shear-cell of the Dubble beamline, were shear experiments were performed, albeit under less controlled conditions.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the evaluated shear protocols yielded any orientation of the LCP phase in the thermoplastic matrix. There are several reasons for this behavior; 1) The viscosity of the polyester matrix is relatively low, thereby decreasing its sensitivity to shear, 2) the sample slips on the kapton windows used in the shear cell (these are nessecary as the other windows interfere with the WAXD scattering), and 3) the LCP has a very fast relaxation in blends in the order of 2 second which coincides with the framerate of our experiments. Examplary XRD patterns showing the LCP already almost in a fully relaxed state directly after the application of shear (right image) is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> together with the reference materials. After trying to develop alternative protocols, we have resorted to evaluation of the crystallization behavior of the materials without the application of shear. Different samples have successfully been tested: PPDL, PCL, but also PLA with nucleating agent as reference. An example of the crystallization behavior of PLA with nucleating agent during cooling in the shear cell is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Right, WAXD pattern of 30 wt% LCP in polyester mounted in the shear-cell (10 seconds of shear with 50 s -1 ) directly after the application of shear, suggesting that LCP orientation is low and rapidly relaxes in the current set-up.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,81.95,102.60,141.75,141.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
