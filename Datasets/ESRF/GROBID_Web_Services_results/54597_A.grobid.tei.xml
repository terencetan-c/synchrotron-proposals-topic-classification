<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of this study is to describe a Cobalt-based Fisher-Tropsch catalyst, to showcase the potential of using XRD-CT to study and understand the effect of different reduction protocols on these types of catalysts.</p><p>For each experiment, three trilobe pellets (Ø 1.5 mm, h = 3 mm) of the catalyst were mounted on top of each other in a capillary. Five different reductions were carried out on the sample and are presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Table 1: Description of the reduction parameters Exp.# Gas (H2) GHSV (h -1 ) Temperature programme 1 100% 5000 RT to 300°C at 1°C/min.

Even in such small amounts of catalysts, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows this difference on the experiment at 4% and 100% of H2 at the space velocity of 5000 h -1 .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Diffractograms after the experiment at 4% and 100% of H2 at the space velocity of 5000 h -1 of three extrudates mounted in capillaries.</p><p>An important difference is also observed when we compare those two experiments. The fresh catalyst presents the Bragg reflections of the Co3O4 phase while the experiment at 4% of H2 shows CoO and the experiment at 100% of H2 shows Co fcc (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>

This necessitated mounting the catalyst body in a quartz cell with a gas delivery connector. The reduction experiments were carried out offline in the ID15 chemical laboratory at the ESRF on a setup containing two heat guns and a gas delivery system. At the end of each experiment, the reactor cells were sealed, fixed to a goniometer and then attached to a rotation stage for XRD-CT analysis.</p><p>This experiment was carried out at station ID15A using a high energy monochromatic, 50 μm square section pencil beam. For each sample, diffraction was recorded at 70 translations spaced 50 μm across the body each with 60 rotations of 3°, corresponding to 4200 projections. Each diffraction pattern was recorded for 500 ms. Powder ring data were obtained and these were radially integrated for each diffraction "projection". For each observed intensity in these radially integrated patterns, a sinogram was constructed and then back-projected to a 66 x 66 pixel image. The Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>  Two cobalt phases are observable depending on the reduction parameters:</p><p>-at low H2 concentration (4%), only the oxide CoO is observable -at 100% H2, the active phase for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, Co fcc, appears.</p><p>The reconstructed images show that the cobalt is well distributed inside the pellet but with a slightly higher intensity in the outer circumference probably due to impregnation conditions.</p><p>Support subtraction artefact Support sub Co3O4 CoO Co fcc</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Andrew M.
