<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment, we used Cu L3 edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect the charge order in high-Tc superconducting YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) thin films and nanostructures on <ref type="bibr">MgO (110)</ref> substrates. In particular, we have studied the evolution of such order with the dimensionality of the system, in superconducting objects, having a size comparable to that of the charge density wave correlation length ξCDW, with properties unaffected by the nanopatterning <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We focused on four different samples corresponding to three different oxygen doping: a slightly overdoped sample, with thickness t = 50 nm and critical temperature TC = 85.2 K (OD85), a slightly underdoped sample, with t = 50 nm and TC = 81.1 K (UD81), and two underdoped samples with TC = 61.8 K, UD62-50 and UD62-8, having respectively t = 50 nm and 8.5 nm. On each chip we have explored an unpatterned area (0.5x3 mm 2 , the "thin film"), to get a reference signal, and several patterned regions (0.5x3 mm 2 ), with nanodots and nanostripes having lateral dimensions in the range 50 -200 nm (larger, but comparable with ξCDW) and in the range 10 -50 µm (much larger than ξCDW). We have directly observed charge density modulation in the "thin film" regions of the four samples, at momentum transfer q//~0.31 r.l.u.. The effect of lateral confinement on charge order looks very strong, since we found no charge order peak in structures below 200 nm. In addition, we have also measured the paramagnon dispersions along the high-symmetry directions, as a function of the object lateral size, for the four samples under investigation. In this brief report, we will mainly present our charge order results including the doping and the temperature dependence, both in unpatterned areas and in nanostructrues, and the effects played on CDW by the strain induced by the substrate and by the thickness confinement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-----Thin films</head><p>Taking advantage of the small beam spot size (4 x 60 m 2 ) at ID32 and of its excellent positioning control and stability, we have explored the RIXS spectra related to the unpatterned regions of our samples, whose size is 0.5x3 mm 2 . A charge density wave (CDW) order has been revealed at any oxygen doping, proven by the variation of the RIXS intensity of the quasi elastic peak, as a function of the momentum-transfer component parallel to the CuO2 planes q//, which is maximum at q//~0.31 r.l.u. (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The intensity of the CDW peak is dependent on the oxygen doping, being much smaller in the slightly overdoped YBCO sample (OD85) than in the three underdoped ones. We have studied the charge order in the sample UD81 as a function of the temperature: the CDW peak can be seen already at 10 K and becomes sharper and more intense at T approaching the superconducting critical temperature TC; above TC, the intensity of charge order signal decreases (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). At T&gt;140 K a weak and very broad peak, centered at q//~0.31 r.l.u., is still present: it persists, with an almost temperature independent intensity, up to T≈250 K, well above the maximum TCDW measured so far on YBCO single crystals and thin films. This feature, which could be a consequence of the strain induced by the substrate on the film, will require further investigation.</p><p>We investigated the charge order in our samples both along the a-and the b-axis of YBCO. A difference is clearly visible, independent of temperature and oxygen doping: we observe a splitting in q// of the CDW peak along the YBCO b-axis direction (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This is a consequence of the buckling of the atomic planes of YBCO along the b-axis, when grown on MgO (110) (see inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This confirms the strong intertwining between strain and charge order in our films.</p><p>We have also investigated the effect of the film thickness on the charge order, at a fixed oxygen doping (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). In particular, we have measured the CDW peak both along the [1 0] (a-axis) and the [0 1] (b-axis) YBCO direction, to check if there is any relative variation of intensity, which could be compatible with the observed depression of the pseudogap temperature T* in ultrathin films along b-axis. The understanding of these measurements is currently in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-----Nanostructures</head><p>All the nanostructures are protected by an amorphous carbon capping layer, which leaves unaltered the signal coming from the CDW. The effects of inplane confinement are indeed extremely strong at any investigated oxygen doping: while on 10 µm wide wires the peak at (0.31,0,l) is still as strong as on the unpatterned areas, in the case of the 50 nm and 200 nm wide structures there is no hint of CDW peak (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>), even though the intensity of the quasi-elastic peak, from whose modulation in q the CDW peak is determined, is still very strong. We are currently scrutinizing among different models, to understand the reason of the disappearance of the CDW peak in very small structures, with the aim of writing soon a manuscript about these surprising results. More beam time will be needed to estimate the critical dimension at which such transition occurr.</p></div>
