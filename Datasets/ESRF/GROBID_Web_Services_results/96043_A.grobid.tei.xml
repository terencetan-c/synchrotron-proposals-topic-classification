<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Abstract</head><p>Several series of hybrid orgainc/inorganic perovskite thin film samples were analyzed by GIWAXS during the beamtime. Those included different kinds of 2D perovskite structures as well as perovskite films produced by novel deposition techniques to obtain more uniform and phase-pure perovskite materials suitable for photovoltaic application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Results</head><p>Shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> are reciprocal space maps of multiple cation perovskites fabricated via the wellestablished antisolvent method. A novel antisolvent application procedure was investigated, which significantly improved the film quality and photovoltaic performance. Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) corresponds to a perovskite film produced by the standard antisolvent procedure, exhibiting a considerable amount of excess lead iodide phase (indicated by the yellow arrow). In contrast, we could prove a distinct reduction of the excess lead iodide and therefore a higher perovskite phase purity in the sample produced with the new antisolvent application method, which is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Also, by using GIWAXS with varying incidence angles, we could determine the distribution of the impurity phase throughout the perovskite film and with that information reveal the underlying mechanisms of structure formation depending on the fabrication method.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Reciprocal space maps of multi-cation perovskites fabricated with the antisolvent method using a) the conventional application procedure and b) a novel application method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Remarks on quality of measurements</head><p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, the beamtime was conducted via mailing in the samples and the experiments were done by our local contacts. Thanks to their hard work and dedication we received an incredible amount of high-quality data. The ID10 beamline was perfectly suited to our experiments and using the pilatus 300K detector, we obtained excellent results.</p><p>We thank our local contacts Oleg Konovalov and Maciej Jankowski for the excellent work during the beamtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Status and progress of data evaluation</head><p>As a result of the large amount of data obtained from the beamtime, analysis is still in progress. We aim to include the data series in several publications once they are fully analyzed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Received at ESRF:Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Lena Merten*, Alexander Hinderhofer*, Frank Schreiber Institut f체r Angewandte Physik -Universit채t T체bingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 10, 72076 T체bingen, Germany Report:</figDesc></figure>
