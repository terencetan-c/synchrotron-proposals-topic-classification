<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During experiments at ID26 we have investigated the role of ionic liquid, IL (EMIM OTf), into the stabilization of Ni-and PtNi-based electrocatalysts in situ in acidic (0.1 M HClO4) and alkaline (0.05 M NaOH) environments. Specifically, we collected Ni Kα HERFD XANES and EXAFS spectra under potential (potentiostatic protocol)/current hold (galvanostatic protocol) in a three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Ni-and PtNi-based electrodes (thickness ca 30 nm) were manufactured by electron-beam physical vapour deposition on a carbon paper (Toray Carbon Paper, TGP-H-60) substrate at Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung (MPIE, Germany). In total 27 protocols have been tested with and without IL. The spectra were analyzed using python-based scripts developed at ID26 beamline.  and with IL presence, respectively. Please note that not all the potentials are shown in the panels for the sake of clarity. We observe that in the absence of IL an increase of the applied potential leads to gradual changes in the intensity of the white line and of the pre-edge that can be correlated with a partial oxidation of Ni sites. Interestingly, these changes are not reversible when we decrease the potential back, moreover, the oxidation process continues (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>). In case of IL-containing electrolyte, increase of the applied potential also leads to partial oxidation of Ni sites, however in this case, this process is reversible (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>). Further oxidation of Ni may lead to its leaching from the electrode, which is currently being investigated by dissolution studies using a scanning flow cell (SFC) connected to the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The tests are performed on the same group of samples following the experimental protocols used during this beamtime and cover besides Ni dissolution also the dissolution of Pt in the PtNi alloys. At least four XANES spectra (30sec each) were collected at each potential (or current in case of galvanostatic protocol), allowing the time-resolved analysis of Ni K edge data.   We also recorded EXAFS spectra under the same experimental conditions in order to investigate the changes in local structure of Ni sites. These data are still under analysis. Except for in situ data, we also collected ex situ spectra on the reference materials, pristine and post-mortem catalysts. As it was mentioned above, the XAS data will be supplemented by in situ dissolution results as well as post-mortem characterisation of the materials studied here using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The publication(s) featuring these results will be prepared asap.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a.

While Ni sites remain almost unchanged during this protocol (Figure3a), the addition of IL into the electrolyte does modify Ni surface. Specifically, we observe a shift of Ni white line towards higher energies after applying high current values (stage 5 and 7 of the protocol). We also recorded EXAFS spectra under the same experimental conditions in order to investigate the changes in local structure of Ni sites. These data are still under analysis.</figDesc></figure>
