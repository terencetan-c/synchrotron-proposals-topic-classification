<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD) XANES of a series of reduced forms of Mo nitrogenase (N2ase) were measured during the allotted beam time reported herein. Previous 57 Fe Mössbauer studies found that a distinctly different reduced state M I was generated in Mo N2ase upon cryoreduction compared to that observed during native turnover (M R ). It was proposed this difference arises from reduction at the Fe-centers of the catalytic FeMoco cluster under cryoreducing conditions, whereas the Mo of FeMoco was reduced under native conditions. At the time of this study, the oxidation state of Mo in the FeMoco was believed to be Mo(IV), and the suggestion of reducing to Mo(IV) to Mo(III) in a biological system was quite reasonable. Since then, the oxidation state of Mo has been reassigned as Mo(III), and as the reduction of Mo(III) to Mo(II) is highly unfavorable under most biological conditions it is clear the question of oxidation state distribution in M I and M R must be revisited.</p><p>Activation of N 2 by Mo N2ase is accomplished through the subsequent transfer 8e -and 8H + ; to bind N 2 , 4e -and 4H + must first be stored on the FeMoco cluster of the MoFe protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). At any step beyond E 2 , H 2 may be produced, meaning that e -and H + must be rapidly pushed onto the cluster at a rate greater than H 2 production from the E 2 , E 3 , and E 4 steps. This is accomplished through a crowding mechanism with the second component of the N2ase system, a reducing Fe protein (FeP). This also implies that under native turnover in the absence of N 2 , there is always a distribution of E 0 → E 4 states which is dependent upon the ratio of FeP:MoFe. At low ratios of FeP:MoFe, only the E 0 , E 1 , and E 2 can be accessed, and this can be tuned to generate favorable amounts of E 1 . Cryoreduction allows a more selective reduction of the FeMoco cluster through controlled doses of radiation, allowing an even more restricted distribution i.e. only E 0 &amp; E 1 to be generated. The amount of E 0 state has an S=3/2 ground state, allowing it to be quantified easily by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Cryoreduced samples were generated at 40-50% E 1 , and native samples of ~30% E 1 were produced.</p><p>We initially set out to employ Mo and Fe Kα-HERFD XANES to observe where oxidation state changes occur under cryoreducing and native turnover conditions, and compare these to both one another and to the resting state. During this time, the Kα-HERFD of Mo N2ase under reducing conditions was measured at both Fe and Mo for the first time. It was found that no significant changes occur at Mo, disproving the original hypothesis that a Mocentered reduction occurs under native turnover (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). Additionally, an increase in the Fe white line was observed, which is consistent with some of our previous observations for reduction in iron-sulfur clusters. However, the observed changes in the white line and rising edge in are very, very minute (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Comparing these results to previous data we have collected on model complexes (1), the differences are consistent with what one would expect after accounting for iron concentrations, but unfortunately are still statistically insignificant despite extensive data collection. Further investigations are underway to elucidate these changes at Fe through 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, and we look to continue these studies using 57 Fe NIS, Fe K-β XES, and Fe K-β HERFD XAS techniques.</p><p>(1) Rees, J. <ref type="bibr">A. &amp; DeBeer, S., et. al.
