<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this beam time allocation, FaME38 continued development of the two-detector energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction set-up. A schematic of this set-up is shown on the right, below. This set-up has proven to be very beam time-efficient. The use of two detectors simultaneously improves the efficient use of beam time by at least a factor of two. Two directions of strain are measured simultaneously at nearly the same gauge volume (to within 50Âµm). No additional alignment between a change of orientation is required. The set-up was tested for strain scanning ability, since at very low diffraction angles the method becomes increasingly sensitive to grain size and microstructure. Using very narrow slits, and adopting different grain-averaging techniques this effect has been somewhat alleviated. Typical counting times of ~50s are mainly dominated by the limited count rate of the solid-state Ge-detectors, and in many cases additional attenuation of the incident beam was necessary in order not to saturate or overload the detectors. The main advantages of this method: large set-up space for complex sample environment and ability to carry heavy weight, very good penetration (at E&gt;100keV), two directions of strain (if necessary) at high speeds of data acquisition (additional detectors could be installed), the ability to perform full diffraction pattern (allowing the monitoring of e.g. fast phase transitions). Disadvantages: microstructure sensitivity, very elongated gauge volume.</p><p>The improved resolution at very narrow slit openings and small grain sizes make this method a suitable candidate for nano-structural investigations.</p><p>Using scripts that have been developed previously, FaME38 have further created software tools, including a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which allows the rapid near-on-line data analysis.</p><p>The GUI is the front-end to a range of Python scripts and has been developed bearing platform independence and portability in mind. It allows the visualisation and manipulation of large sets of EDXRD patterns, and we are continuing the development to implement a pattern-refinement software routine in order to develop dedicated user-friendly software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Case study</head><p>In this part of experiment, the feasibility of undertaking fast bi-directional strain measurements was tested in the real situation. We studied the effect of mechanical tensioning on Friction Stir Welds in thin aluminium sheets using the two-detector set-up in the energy dispersive mode shown in the illustration above, which measures two directions of strain (longitudinal and transverse) simultaneously. Below is shown a typical diffraction pattern as a function of energy (left), and the residual longitudinal stresses as a function of applied tension in % yield stress (right). The experiment, a collaboration between FaME38 and BAE Systems Advanced Technology Centre, Bristol, UK, was completed in less than 1 shift of beam time.</p><p>The results are currently being prepared for publication.</p><p>-75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 -96 -72 -48 -24 0 24 48 72 96 -75 -50 -25 0 25 50 75 Distance from weld line [mm] 70%YS 35%YS Stress [MPa] 0%YS</p></div>		</body>
