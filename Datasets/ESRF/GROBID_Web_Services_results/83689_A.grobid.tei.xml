<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The adsorption and self-assembly of PbSe nanocrystals (NCs) at liquid-air interfaces has led to remarkable nanocrystal superlattices, which show atomic order and a superimposed nanoscale geometry. Previous experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have unraveled the mechanism of formation of the superlattice with a square nanogeometry, which is governed by remarkable phase transitions. Following these results, we now focus on the adsorption geometry of PbSe NC monolayers at the liquid-air interface. We combine in-situ grazing-incidence small/wide angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS/GIWAXS) combined with X-ray reflectivity (XRR) to obtain the 3-D adsorption geometry of the nanocrystal monolayer. We extract the electron density profile in the direction perpendicular to the liquid-air interface from the XRR measurements, and show that nanocrystals larger than 5.5 nm align with a &lt;100&gt; direction perpendicular to the interface. We combine the information from the three techniques in order to build a full three-dimensional in-situ picture of PbSe nanocrystals adsorbed at the ethylene glycol-air interface. The adsorption geometry of the NCs before oriented attachment are expected to have great impact on the atomically connected 2-D superlattices.</p><p>We start the discussion of the obtained results based on the GISAXS data presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The data is acquired upon complete solvent evaporation. The GISAXS signal for the small NCs, shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref> shows Bragg rods at positions of 0.94 nm -1 , 1.62 nm -1 and 1.88 nm -1 in the horizontal scattering direction q y with a FWHM of 0.06 nm -1 . The peak positions of 1:√3:2 indicate that the NCs are ordered in a 2-D hexagonal lattice with a NC center-to-center distance of 7.7±0.4 nm, roughly the NC diameter plus interdigitated oleic acid ligands. The GISAXS pattern of the medium sized NCs, depicted in figure 1(b), shows Bragg rods at 0.86 nm -1 and 1.71 nm -1 in the q y direction with a FWHM of 0.08 nm -1 . The 1:2 relative peak positions indicate that there is a preference for NC ordering in one dimension, e.g. the formation of linear structures. The NC center-tocenter distance is calculated to be 7.3±0.7 nm. The relatively small center-to-center distance of the NCs compared to the NC diameter is not fully understood. For the large NCs, the GISAXS signal depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c)</ref> shows Bragg rods at 0.75 nm -1 , 1.52 nm -1 and 2.18 nm -1 in the q y direction with a FWHM of 0.05 nm -1 . Again, the 1:2:3 relative peak positions indicate that there is a preference for NC ordering in one dimension. The center-to-center distance is calculated to be 8.4±0.5 nm. Even though the occurrence of oriented attachment cannot be fully excluded, which would explain the decreased center-to-center distances of the NCs, we think it is highly unlikely to occur due to the presence of additional ligands in the ethylene glycol subphase. The crystallographic orientation of the NCs is obtained by measuring the diffraction from their atomic lattices, which is presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We calculated the expected GIWAXS pattern for NCs having a [001] axis pointing perpendicular to the liquid-air interface in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b-d</ref>) show the GIWAXS patterns corresponding to the small, medium sized and large NCs respectively, which were recorded simultaneously with the GISAXS patterns in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For the small NCs we observe powder rings in the GIWAXS pattern, which means that the NCs do not have a preferential orientation at the liquid-air interface. Either the NCs are still freely rotatable, or the ensemble of NCs have random, static orientations which will average out in a ring in the GIWAXS pattern.</p><p>The GIWAXS pattern of the medium sized NCs, shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c</ref>), shows a series of well-defined diffraction spots. An azimuthal intensity trace over the reflection originating from the {222} planes shows that it has an orientation of 36.0 o with respect to the liquid-air interface, corresponding to NCs having a {001} facet pointing upwards. The FWHM of the reflection, which is an indication of the degree of rotational freedom the NCs still have at the liquid-air interface, is 6.5 o . The GIWAXS pattern of the large NCs, shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d)</ref>, matches the calculated GIWAXS pattern very well. It shows that the NCs have the same orientation as the medium-sized NCs, i.e. a {001} facet pointing upwards. The distribution in orientations is slightly smaller, as the FWHM of the 222 reflection is 6.1 o . This means that the large NCs have less rotational freedom at the liquid-air interface.</p><p>The orientation of the NCs is also verified by looking at intensity traces in the 2θ direction along the scattering horizon (azimuthal angle equals ~1o ), which are not shown in this report. For the medium-sized and the large NCs, only reflections originating from {hk0} PbSe lattice planes are observed along the scattering horizon. These particular atomic planes are oriented perpendicular to the liquid-air interface when the NCs have a [001] axis pointing upwards, and hence scatter horizontally. Previously observed superlattices from PbSe NCs have been shown to show attachment of their {100} facets. We are able to verify whether or not the NCs are attached, by looking at the FWHM of the 400 reflection in the horizontal scattering direction and estimating the crystalline size of the NCs. Since the diameters obtained using the Scherrer equation are not significantly larger than the NC diameters determined by TEM, we conclude that the NCs are not connected and no oriented attachment has occured. NC alignment was also observed by Van der Stam et al., who recently showed that upon addition of oleic acid, 11 nm polyhedral ZnS bifrustum NCs align atomically with their {002} facet pointing upwards at the ethylene glycol-air interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. They show that two crystallographic orientations of the NCs are possible at the liquid-air interface. The one which is observed experimentally is determined by the relative size of the specific NC facet; the orientation is such that the facet with the largest surface area is planar with the liquid-air interface.</p><p>A similar explanation could be applied to the experiments shown here. As the NCs grow in size, the truncation is decreased and the NCs attain a more cubic shape. This means that the relative size of the {100} facets increases at the expense of the {110} and {111} facets. Especially for the large NCs, which have relatively large {100} facets, this would mean that the minima in the adsorption free energy are deeper compared to those for the other adsorption geometries. However, this does not explain why we do not observe any NCs which align crystallographically with a [111] axis perpendicular to the ethylene glycol-air interface, the alignment of the NCs for the honeycomb superlattice. (c) GIWAXS pattern of the medium-sized NCs, which can be fitted well to NCs pointing a [001] axis upwards, perpendicular to the liquid-air interface. The width of the 222 reflection is an indication of how well the NCs are atomically aligned with respect to the liquid-air interface. The medium-sized nanocrystals have a 6.5 o variation in orientation (FWHM). (d) GIWAXS pattern of the large NCs, which can also be fitted well to NCs pointing a [001] axis upwards. The width of the 222 reflection is smaller compared to the same reflection of the medium sized NCs; the large nanocrystals have a 6.1 o variation in orientation (FWHM).</p><p>We continue the discussion here with a comparison of the XRR data from the small and large PbSe NCs, which is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. For the fitting of the data, we apply a recursive fitting procedure based on a Parratt formalism. In this fitting procedure, the nanoparticles are approximated to be spherical and are placed on an ethylene-glycol air interface. The density profile in the z direction is divided into N strata, or layers, for which the average value of the refractive index, n j = 1δ j + iβ j , is calculated. The fit takes into account the position of the particle with respect to the liquid-air interface, the thickness of the ligand corona around the NC and several density and roughness parameters.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (a) shows the measured XRR curve from the small NCs as blue dots, with the corresponding fit as a red solid line. The clear oscillations of the signal only show one period, proving that we truly are looking at a monolayer of NCs. The value of the real part of the refractive index of each layer j, δ j , is proportional to the electron density of that layer. This is plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(b)</ref>. The maximum of the SLD profile corresponds to a mean value for the center of mass of the NCs above the liquid-air interface level. The center of mass of the small NCs is sticking out 1.9 nm above the ethylene glycol-air interface. This can be rationalized considering the oleate ligands on the surface of the NCs. The apolar tails do not want to stick into the polar ethylene glycol and hence the particles prefer to be on top of the liquid. The acquired PbSe film thickness of 5.0 nm is in good agreement with the obtained size of the NCs using TEM.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (c) presents the measured XRR curve from the large NCs as blue dots, with the corresponding fit as a red solid line. Again only one periodicity of the XRR signal is observed, confirming that we are measuring a NC monolayer again. The corresponding SLD plot, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3(d)</ref> shows that the center of mass of the large NCs is sticking out 3 nm above the ethylene glycol-air interface. This also explains the easy transfer to solid substrates using a Langmuir-Schaefer type stamping technique. We do note that the models of the NCs can be improved significantly, e.g. by using a truncated cubic shape of the NCs with varying truncation parameters for the different NC sizes. This will ultimately result in better fits of the XRR data and a more detailed description of the adsorption behaviour of the NCs at the ethylene glycol-air interface. We note that the observed NC adsorption geometry could differ strongly from the initial adsorption geometry at the toluene-air interface. Future experiments will be focussed on obtaining a stable (i.e. non evaporating) toluene-air interface to see how the NCs adsorb and align during the early stages of the self-assemblyprocess. The data presented above is only on three size populations of NCs. We managed to obtain data on NCs with 11 different sizes, which will allow us to do a very thorough analysis on the size-dependent adsorption geometry. For the first time, we have managed to obtain a full 3-D picture, from the NC to the atomic length scales, of how NCs adsorb at a liquid-air interface, which is of high interest to the scientific community. The remainder of the data is still being analyzed, but we aim to publish the work in a high-impact journal (e.g. ACS Nano or Nano Letters).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: GISAXS data for the small (a), medium (b) and large (c) PbSe NCs.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,51.05,142.40,480.05,271.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
