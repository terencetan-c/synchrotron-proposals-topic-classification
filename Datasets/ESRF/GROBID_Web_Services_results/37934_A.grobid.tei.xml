<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The project is dedicated to the in-situ and ex-situ powder diffraction study of hydrolysis reactions of light metal hydrides which are considered as possible hydrogen carriers for future mobile applications. Their reaction with water is one of the ways to liberate hydrogen <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In-situ diffraction experiments allowed us to follow the evolution of the crystalline phases during hydrolysis and thus shed some light on the reaction mechanisms in hydride-H 2 O systems.</p><p>In-situ and ex-situ synchrotron powder diffraction study of the hydrolysis of NaBH 4 , Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , LiAlH 4 , NaAlH 4 , α-AlH 3 , NaMgH 3 , Ca 4 Mg 3 H 14 was done and the possibility of the ammonia-borane (NH 3 BH 3 ) hydrate and KBH 4 hydrates formation was investigated. For this purpose MAR345 area detector was used to collect X-ray synchrotron powder patterns each 2 minutes during the reactions. To influence the kinetics, the reaction volume was cooled or heated by the Oxford Cryostream 700+ system. To provide suitable pressures of water vapour an in-house system was constructed at SNBL. For investigation of the hydrolysis reactions three different setups were used, where hydrides were allowed to react with 1) air humidity; 2) water vapour brought by a stream of wet nitrogen gas; 3) a droplet of water placed in a direct contact with the sample or in a close proximity to it. To study the possibility of the KBH 4 and NH 3 BH 3 hydrate formation water solution of these compounds with different concentrations were prepared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NaBH 4</head><p>The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with humid air, water and water vapour, with catalyst CeNi 3 and without it in the temperature interval 20 -120 0 C. NaBH 4 is the most stable with respect to hydrolysis: in the reaction with water or water vapour below 40 0 C it yields only the hydrate NaBH 4 ⋅2H 2 O [2], while at higher practical temperatures (&lt;120 0 C) the H 2 release is very slow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>α-AlH 3</head><p>The initial sample contained four different polymorphs of alane: α-, β-, γ-and α'-AlH 3 phases: α-AlH 3 (94.1 wt%); β-AlH 3 (3.1 wt%); γ-AlH 3 (1.4 wt%); α '-AlH 3 (1.4 wt%). The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with water and water vapour at room temperature. The compound reacts without formation of intermediate phases, yielding Al(OH) 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mg(BH 4 ) 2</head><p>The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with humid air, water and water vapour in the temperature interval -30 -+60 0 C. The compound reacts without formation of intermediate phases, yielding an amorphous phase as a final product of the hydrolysis reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LiAlH 4</head><p>The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with humid air, water and water vapour in the temperature interval -30 -+40 0 C. The final product of the reaction with water or water vapour is LiAl 2 (OH) 7 ⋅2H 2 O and the amorphous phase forms as an intermediate product of the hydrolysis reaction. LiOH⋅H 2 O forms as an intermediate in the reaction of LiAlH 4 with water at lower temperatures (3°C). LiAlH 4 is very reactive and on contact with air it reacts with atmospheric CO 2 forming the carbonate Li 2 CO 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NaAlH 4</head><p>The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with humid air, water and water vapour in the temperature interval -20 -+25 0 C. The final product of the reaction with water or water vapour is Al(OH) 3 and the amorphous phase forms as an intermediate product of the hydrolysis reaction. NaAlH 4 is very reactive and on contact with air it reacts with atmospheric CO 2 with carbonate Na 2 CO 3 and carbonate hydrate Na 2 CO 3 ⋅H 2 O formation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NaMgH 3</head><p>The initial sample was prepared using standard solid-state method at the Laboratoire de Cristallographie, Université de Genève and contains NaMgH 3 (86.90 wt%); NaH (7.56 wt%); MgO (5.54 wt%). The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with humid air and water vapour at room temperature. The final product of the reaction is Mg(OH) 2 and the amorphous phase forms as an intermediate product of the hydrolysis reaction. NaMgH 3 is very reactive and on contact with air it reacts with atmospheric CO 2 with carbonate Na 2 CO 3 and carbonate hydrate Na 2 CO 3 ⋅H 2 O formation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ca 4 Mg 3 H 14</head><p>The initial sample contains Ca 4 Mg 3 H 14 (53.74 wt%); CaH 2 (27.02 wt%); Mg (19.24 wt%). The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample with humid air, water and water vapour at room temperature. The final product of the reaction is Ca(OH) 2 and the amorphous phase forms as an intermediate product of the hydrolysis reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KBH 4</head><p>According to the paper [3] a few solid hydrates of potassium borohydride occur at temperatures below 0 0 C. For this purpose four solutions were prepared 1) 0.2 g KOH -1.2 g KBH 4 -11 ml H 2 O; 2) 0.98 g KOH -0.99 g KBH 4 -10 ml H 2 O; 3)1.33 g KOH -1.0 g KBH 4 -10 ml H 2 O; 4) KBH 4 -H 2 O saturated in the borohydride. The synchrotron powder patterns were collected during the reactions of the sample in the temperature interval -110 -+25 0 C and revealed the formation of KBH 4 cubic crystals only.</p><p>NH 3 BH 3 Ammonia-borane is rather stable with respect to the hydrolysis at room temperature. It was interesting to obtain a hypothetical hydrate of ammonia-borane and to study its crystal structure. For this purpose the saturated water solution was prepared and cooled down to -33 0 C at a rate of 40 0 C/h. To promote hydrolysis the solution was heated up to 150 0 C at a rate 20 0 C/h. The synchrotron powder patterns were collected simultaneously. Ammonia-borane was observed as the only crystalline phase.</p><p>The results were presented at the Swiss Society for Crystallography meeting in Zurich, on 8-9 Sept. 2008.</p><p>[1] Fakioglu E., Yürüm Y., Veziroglu T.N., Int.
