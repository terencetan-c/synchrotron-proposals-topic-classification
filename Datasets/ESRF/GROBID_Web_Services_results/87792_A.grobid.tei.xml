<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Experimental data. The local atomic structure of admixture of critical metal, In, and accompanying 1 st group metals -Cu and Ag in sphalerite ((Zn, Fe)S) was examined by means of XAS (XANES/EXAFS). Initially we planned to study only Cu-In-bearing sphalerites, but finally a series of Ag-In sphalerites was added to the list of samples to obtain information about the systematic changes of the local atomic structure of trace elements along the 1 st group of the periodic system. The spectra were acquired at Cu K-edge, In K-edge, and Ag K-edge. The experiment consisted in the record of the spectra of:</p><p>-a series of synthetic Cu-In sphalerites; -a sample of synthetic Cu-bearing (In-free) sphalerite (Cu K-edge spectra were recorded at ambient and high temperatures); -a series of natural Cu-In sphalerites from Kudriavy volcano (Iturup island, Russia; Cu K-edge spectra of one sample was recorded at the formation temperature of 500 °C); -a series of natural Cu-bearing sphalerites from two European deposits (only Cu K-edge spectra); -two samples of Ag-In sphalerites. Experimental results. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows XANES spectra for In, Cu, and Ag K-edges of selected samples of synthetic and natural sphalerites. The In K-edge spectra are identical for all the samples, including sample of Au-In sphalerite, which is shown for comparison in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. As indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, in all the samples studied in the course of the experiment In occupies cationic position in the structure of sphalerite. It is tetrahedrally coordinated with the nearest S atoms at a distance of 2.45 Å (Cu-In sphalerite) and 2.46 Å (Ag-In and Au-In sphalerite). In contrast, the spectra of Cu and Ag K-edges are dependent on the sample composition and formation conditions. The Cu K-edge XANES spectra of synthetic Cu-In sphalerites (samples No. 4186, 4108, top of the figure), and the spectra of natural sample No. 501 (bottom of the figure) are close to the spectra of CuInS 2 . Similarly, Ag K-edge XANES spectra of one sphalerite sample (No. 4197) are close to the spectra of AgInS 2 . Analysis of Cu and Ag K-edges EXAFS spectra, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, imply that in these samples the admixtures of the 1 st group metals are in the solid solution state and located in the cationic position. No In has been observed in the 2 nd coordination sphere of the metal, as well as no metal (Cu or Ag) are located in the second coordination sphere of In, which means that all the admixtures are statistically distributed within the sphalerite structure without Cu-In and Ag-In clustering. The distance between atoms of the 1 st group metals and the nearest S atoms increases with increasing the cation size and is equal to 2.30 Å for Cu and 2.49 Å for Ag (previously we determined the Au-S distance for the solid solution Au in sphalerite as 2.6-2.7 Å which is in line with the distance for the other 1 st group metals). In the absence of In, Cu in sphalerite is in the state of Cu 2 S (sample No. 4065, central panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), or forms Cu oxide in oxidized natural samples No. PE8 and ME77. Heating of natural sphalerite yielded no changes in the XANES spectrum, whereas heating of synthetic Cu-bearing In-free sphalerite resulted in formation of Cu oxide. Further work on the experimental data treatment will consist in investigation of details of the local atomic structure of the admixtures by the experimental spectra fitting using reverse Monte Carlo method, and simulation of the spectra for atomic geometries relaxed by means of DFT method.</p></div>
