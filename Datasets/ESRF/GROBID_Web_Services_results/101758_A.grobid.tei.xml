<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Summary</head><p>A bifunctional Ni-based catalyst, Ni/MgFeAlO4, was found to be highly carbon resistant in methane dry reforming (DRM). As next research step, Ca was introduced for sorption functionality to make a trifunctional material, Ni/CaMgFeAlO for chemical looping super-dry reforming. In this campaign, H2-TPR, CO2-carbonation and -decarbonation have been performed and followed by in-situ XRS-XES. The light elements O and Ca were recorded by XRS to investigate the effect of incorporated CaO in carbonation-decarbonation, while the transition elements Ni and Fe were followed by XES to study the NiFe alloy formation and the influence of Ni on the CO2 capacity of CaO. The data analysis has been started by the PhD, joint between LCT, Ghent University, and ID20, ESRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>We made use of an ESRF reactor cell with a spherical Kapton dome (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> left), allowing x-ray access over a 2π solid angle. To admit reaction gases, a gas feed rig with mass flow controllers and switching valves was brought by the users and installed inside the hutch, next to the gas bottles <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1. right)</ref>. The main sample for this in-situ investigation is 5%Ni/CaFeMgAlO. This was placed as a pellet in the reactor cell and heated to reaction temperature (~830°C) in H2, to induce Ni-Fe alloying. After H2-TPR, CO2 was introduced (~650°C) to induce CO2 sorption by CaO (transforming to CaCO3) and possible oxidation of Ni and Fe. Hereafter, the temperature was raised to ~830°C to track CO2 desorption/CaCO3 decomposition. Experiments performed and first results for Ca and O K signals Ca L2,3 edge: Ca L2,3 edge spectra of 5%Ni/CaFeMgAlO recorded at RT in He for fresh, reduced (after H2-TPR), re-oxidized (after CO2-carbonation) state and after decarbonation at 830°C are shown in black, red, green and violet, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). The peaks at 349.5 eV (P2) and 353 eV (P4) correspond to the L3 and L2 edge, originating from transition from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 to the unoccupied conduction d band, respectively. The shoulder peaks P1 and P3 were generated due to the crystal field that arose from the symmetry of atoms around Ca 2+ . A clear change at the L2,3 edge is observed after treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). The intensity of the L2,3 peaks decreases after reduction, but increases above the fresh state upon CO2 re-oxidation. After decarbonation, the L2,3 intensity decreases below the fresh one, even deeper than for the reduced state. Differences between the sample and reference Ca L2,3 spectra of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>. The intensity of the shoulder peaks in the treated sample lies significantly below the ones for the references, which indicates a different local environment around Ca 2+ . Further analysis is needed to quantify and interprete these changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 left: reactor cell amidst the XRS and XES detectors; right: gas feed rig</head><p>O K-edge: The O K-edge recorded at RT in He is shown in black, red, green and violet for the fresh, reduced, re-oxidized state and the one after decarbonation, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). A pre-edge is observed at 532 eV, whereas the main feature of the K edge is at 541 eV. The edge intensity increases gradually after carbonation and decarbonation treatment. In addition, a distinguishable shoulder is observed at 537.5 eV, which becomes more prominent/distinct after treatment. Unfortunately, the heating supply of the in-situ reactor dome failed on Friday evening, after which high temperature control was lost (max temperature was then limited to 550°C, i.e. insufficient for adequate reduction). Despite some help from the EHO, much appreciated, the problem could not be solved and hence experiments could not be continued as planned over the entire weekend. For instance, no measurements could be performed with a trifunctional material of different composition or with physical mixtures. Some ex-situ and low T measurements were performed instead.</p><p>Concluding, we have performed combined XRS and XES measurements on one trifunctional material during in-situ reduction/carbonation/decarbonation treatment at 830°C. The sample examined should allow us to understand its behavior under reduction, CO2 oxidation and decarbonation. These results will be used in a publication with working title 'In-situ XRS-XES study of trifunctional materials for super-dry reforming.'

The spectral features P1, P2, P3, P4 in CaCO3 (Figure3B) arise due to Ca-O and Ca-C hybridization. As the oxygen environment in Ni/MgCaFeAlO is different from pure CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2, containing also a contribution from the spinel phase CaFeMgAlO, the pure CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 references cannot describe the O K edge of 5%Ni/CaFeMgAlO accurately.</figDesc></figure>
