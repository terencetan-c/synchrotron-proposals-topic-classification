<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>The Inelastic Spectra of Magnetic Spirals in Chiral FeGe FeGe belongs to the family of B20 chiral cubic crystal systems, analogous to MnSi, which under a small applied magnetic field display a skyrmion spin texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We set out to measure the inelastic spectra of FeGe at low temperatures in zero magnetic field as the high transition temperature (T C ~ 280 K) is an indication of strong magnetic interactions.</p><p>The beamtime was a success with considerable data collected although some issues were encountered, as is to be expected with a beamline still being commissioned. One problem we encountered was that there is iron contamintion in the beamline. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the drain current from the final mirror before the sample (which is directly proportional to the incident intensity at the sample) is significantly reduced when tuning the energy to the iron L3 absorption edge (707 eV). has theeffect of reducing the beam intensity at the L3 edge by 4 -7 fold. The major advantage of the ERIXS end station is the experimental flexibility available to the experimenter afforded by the design. It is very easy to orientate the crystal in reciprocal space and to collect inelastic spectra at different q values and with different x-ray polarisations. We collected scans over the entire range of 2θ from 50° to 140°.</p><p>We were able to observe a strong inelastic signal from our sample, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, which can be seen from the ratio of the peak of the fluorescence to the signal close the elastic line at around -0.5 eV.</p><p>The inelastic features extend from the elastic line to around -0.8 eV which could include d-d excitations. Energy detune measurements were performed, which show a constant energy loss for the double-peak feature. The energy scale is also above that which would be expected for magnons (~25 meV). Further no dispersion was observed for the double-peak feature with increased momentum transfer along both the (010) and (111) directions, ruling out pure magnons as a sole origin [2]. The energy scale is comparable with a crystal-field excitation combined with a spin flip <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, which is of the order of the 3d band splitting This would also not be expected to display dispersion as expected for typical crystal-field excitation.</p><p>While the data is noisy many spectra have been collected and consistently a double-peak feature is observed. This becomes clearer when the incident polarisation is varied as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. With a scattering angle (2θ) of 90° the peak at ~ -0.3 eV shows no polarisation dependence while the one at ~ -0.6 eV shows an increase in intensity with linear horizontal polarised light. Therefore these processes must correspondingly involve a rotation of the polarisation as a Thompson scattering like (ε.ε) dependence would be supressed, and a change in angular momentum of the sample must subsequently be involved. This is consistent with inelastic scattering from an orbital excitation.</p><p>We are now planning to undertake density functional theory calculations to provide information on the band structure to help with the analysis of our results.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Peter Hatton, Durham University* Phil Dean Durham University* Don Paul, Warwick University* Kejin Zhou, Diamond Light Source* Report:</figDesc></figure>
