<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Technical description</head><p>Two DACs with rhenium gaskets were prepared to conduct high-pressure (HP), and lowtemperature-high-pressure (LT-HP) experiments. Each sample chamber contained two natural single crystals of Al-rich and Fe-rich langasite-type structures. Additionally, ruby spheres were loaded for pressure measurements. He gas was loaded into the DACs as a pressure-transmitting medium using the high-pressure gas loading system at ESRF. After gas loading, the pressure inside DACs was 17 GPa and 0.6 GPa for HP and LT-HP, respectively. The HP experiment was performed at room temperature in a pressure range of 17-47.5 GPa with a step of 4 GPa. Decompression was carried out with 10 GPa steps. SCXRD data was collected after each pressure step. The LT-HP experiment consisted of two parts. Firstly, LT measurements were conducted in the range of 230-13.55 K with a step of around 50 K. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 130 K and the compression started up to 37 GPa. At the end of the compression, the temperature was decreased to 60.5 K. Single-crystal data collection was performed at every P-T point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Object of investigation</head><p>Compounds of the langasite family are well known due to a wide range of applications. Recently, Fe-bearing langasite-type structures have attracted great interest due to their multiferroic properties. According to MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic studies, Fe-bearing langasites change magnetic properties upon compression or cooling. It has been envisaged that magnetic transitions are associated with structural changes. Despite that, the single-crystal XRD data is still missing. The conducted study aimed to reveal the structural nature of changes in magnetic properties. Fe-bearing qeltite and Al-bearing paquite, belonging to the langasite family, were investigated for this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results of the high-pressure experiment</head><p>Conducted high-pressure measurements have not revealed structural phase transitions. At all P points, the crystal structure was solved and refined in the initial trigonal space group P321. The difference between Fe-rich crystal and Al-rich crystal has not been observed. However, Fe 3+ coordination has changed from tetrahedral to octahedral (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The most significant modification considers oxygens, which become highly disordered above 19 GPa. Moreover, their atomic displacement parameters are remarkably elongated. Above 35 GPa, oxygens cannot be determined reliably. In conclusion, the pressure-induced changes of magnetic properties in Fe-bearing langasite are not associated with structural phase transition.

Results of high-pressure and low-temperature experiment Similar to high-pressure experiment, the low-temperature measurements did not reveal structural phase transition. At all P-T points, the structure was solved and refined in the P321 space group. However, the change of Fe 3+ coordination has not been observed. Nevertheless, the dependence of the unit-cell volume on the temperature is noteworthy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The volume of both crystals decreased with the temperature dropping up to 180 K. Below this temperature the unit-cell volume increases with the cooling. According to the literature, this phenomenon has not been noted in other langasite-type compounds. Probably, in our experiment, it was caused by technical problems and needs further investigation. Results of the experiments with compression at low temperature of 140 K are comparable to the high-pressure experiment at room temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The Fe 3+ coordination increased to VI. Oxygen sites split at 18 GPa.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Irina Galuskina, Institute of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Poland Prof. Evgeny Galuskin, Institute of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Poland MS Katarzyna Nowak, Institute of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Silesia, Poland Dr habil.
