<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Note: SMIS database notes this experimental session as encompassing 6 shifts. This is incorrect, as the session was scheduled from 12 Oct 8:00 to 13 Oct 8:00. Only 3 shifts were assigned.</p><p>In this experimental session, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces in the mouse brain were imaged for the first time in vivo. Mice were injected with barium nanoparticle-based blood pool contrast agent (ExiTron nano12000) into the ventricle, the combination showing the best results in the post-mortem scans of the previous experimental session. Different injection volumes and injection rates were evaluated in terms of animal tolerance in vivo, achievable contrast and distribution throughout the CSF spaces.</p><p>Anaesthetic tolerance, length of procedure and proper management of body heat are further critical parameters for the survivability of animals. Therefore, before the official beamtime start, the user personnel familiarized themselves with the animal facilities and beamline hutches for optimal workflow, minimizing the time between animal anaesthetic induction and start of the scan. In addition, a parallelized schedule between surgeries and scanning needed to be established to minimize waiting time between scans.</p><p>Mice were mounted in a revised version of the user-designed, mouse holder for in vivo skull SRµCT measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). In order to increase the workflow speed, tooth and ear bars were redesigned to be continuously adjustable. A nose cone was added to increase the points of contact for improved mechanical fixation. The bars and the head piece as a whole were furthermore designed to be removable, allowing for quick replacement and continuation of the experiment in the case of a broken part.</p><p>Cardiac and respiratory cycles were monitored via electrocardiogram to enable retrospective gating. Due to cabling of the electocardiogram, breathing sensor and temperature probe as well as tubing of the water pump for maintaining body heat, only 180° rotation scans were possible with the setup. 2000, 30 000 or 60 000 projections were recorded per scan with 5 ms exposure time at 6.3 µm voxel size, using a 2560 pixel wide pco.edge 5.5 camera and monochromatic beam at a photon energy above the K-edge of barium (37 keV).</p><p>Injection of 5 µl of barium nanoparticles at 0.5 µl/min showed the best result in terms of contrast in the CSF spaces (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref> and <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). The anatomy of CSF-spaces showed considerable difference in morphology comparing to the post-mortem images acquired in Experimental Session 1, supporting the need for in vivo imaging to capture anatomically correct data. Part of these differences can, however, also be attributed to the additional volume of fluid injected, as the injection rate is considerably higher than the natural production rate of CSF at 0.1 µl/min <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2020)</ref>. As slower injection rates would exceed the available time under anaesthesia, however, continuous infusion of contrast agent during the scan would be required to achieve the necessary volume administered for sufficient contrast.</p><p>Datasets were reconstructed using either all projections, or using the recorded electrocardiogram for retrospective cardiac gating. Between 1500 to 4500 projections out of 60 000 could be used per stage in the cycle, depending on heart rate. Comparison between these two modes showed increased blurring of CSF spaces in the non-gated reconstructions, indicating blood flow-induced motion and confirming the need for gated reconstruction.</p><p>Scans with 60 000 projections showed larger motion artifacts compared to scans with 30 000 projections, regardless of gating, indicating non-periodic motion of the animal over the course of a scan. 360° scans would, therefore, be preferred in this type of experiment, as it would allow reconstruction of a 180° scan with half the projections without requiring an additional scan should similar drifts reoccur or only part of the scan be useable due to premature death of the animal.
