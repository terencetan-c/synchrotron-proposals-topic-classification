A dataset to 1.3 A was also collected on native CDK2.</p><p>We collected datasets on ten different CDK2/inhibitor complexes and a high resolution native dataset. Rapid data collection was possible because of the very bright beam and the CCD detector. We also tested crystals of AP2+2, a subunit of the endocytosis complex, and crystals of mutants of the cell cycle control protein p13"""'. A dataset was collected for the mutant S 13G. The second mutant p13"""'(de1ta 87-89) is of interest because it is constitutively dimeric. Unfortunately we were not able to extend the resolution of our previous dataset. The crystals diffract poorly beyond 3.5 A.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Sequential activation of the CDKs directs progress through the eukaryotic cell cycle. Loss of CDK regulation has been genetically linked to the development of human cancers. There is a strong interest in the design of potent and specific CDK inhibitors for use in cancer treatment. Specific CDK inhibitors will be important tools to probe the roles of this kinase family in cell cycle control and apoptosis. A novel series of purine-based CDK inhibitors with IC, values in the low FM range, have been identified through the Anticancer Drug Discovery Initiative, (ADDI), at Newcastle University (unpublished results). Knowledge of the binding mode of these compounds and of the microbial alkaloid staurosporine (a potent but non-specific protein kinase inhibitor) within the CDK2 ATPbinding site has informed another round of compound synthesis. In collaboration with Dr. Laurent Meijer (CNRS, Roscoff) and Dr. Gerhardt Eisenbrand (Kaiserlautern) we have studied a second inhibitor series (E series) derived from plant alkaloids. These compounds inhibit CDC2/cyclin B with measured IC,s in the low nanomolar range. A third inhibitor series (in collaboration with Dr. Laurent Meijer and Dr. Konrad Konig (Hamburg) was also In total, ten compounds were tested in the present beamtime allocation.</figDesc></figure>
