<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction Complexation of actinides by α-hydroxy carboxylate ligands (such as gluconate, C 6 H 11 O 7 -and isosaccharinate, C 6 H 11 O 6 -</p><p>) is of main interest on the context of radioactive waste disposal <ref type="bibr">(Hummel et al., 2005)</ref>. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information on the coordination number of these ligands with radionuclides, especially at high pH values. The general objective of this work is the spectroscopic study of Th(IV) complexes with gluconate and isosaccharinate ligands formed under alkaline environments.</p><p>The specific objectives of the work are:</p><p>-to gain information on the Th coordination chemistry with organic ligands, in terms of bond lengths and coordination numbers.</p><p>-to identify differences (if existing) among the coordination of thorium to gluconate and isosaccharinate.</p><p>-to investigate the possible change of coordination modes between Th and gluconate with pH.</p><p>-to study the role of calcium in the formation of mixed calcium-thorium-gluconate complexes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Several samples were prepared for their analysis:</p><p>1) Solid thorium oxohydroxide, aqueous thorium carbonate and aqueous thorium citrate samples, for comparison purposes.</p><p>2) Aqueous thorium gluconate samples at pH 12.0 and 7.6.</p><p>3) Aqueous thorium isosaccharinate samples at pH=12.0.</p><p>4) Aqueous thorium gluconate samples at pH=12.0 in the presence of calcium.</p><p>Aqueous samples were prepared from the oversaturation direction, mixing the appropriate amounts of ligand and thorium at 25ºC in NaClO 4 (I=0.5M) solutions. The final pH was adjusted with NaOH. Samples were prepared under nitrogen atmosphere to avoid carbonate contamination.</p><p>Before the analysis, the samples were filtered with ≈20 nm or ≈1.2 nm filters to avoid the presence of solid thorium particles or colloids. Final thorium concentrations in the aqueous samples were ≈ 1•10 -3 mol/dm 3 ; ligand aqueous concentrations in solution varied between 0.01 and 0.5 mol/dm 3 .</p><p>The EXAFS spectra were collected in the fluorescence mode (except the solid thorium oxohydroxide, which was collected in the transmission mode) at room temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Preliminary data analysis was performed using the WinXAS (Ressler, 1998) software. Theoretical scattering amplitudes for each absorber and backscattered pair were calculated with the FEFF 8.20 code <ref type="bibr">(Rehr and Albers, 2000)</ref>. A single value of the shift in threshold energy, ∆E 0 , was allowed to vary for all coordination shells of a given sample. Principal component (PC) analysis was done with the PC application in Sixpack <ref type="bibr">(Webb, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The analysis of solid thorium oxohydroxide indicates the coordination of ~8 oxygens at 2.43 Å, which is in agreement with the theoretical structure of thorianite <ref type="bibr">(Whitfield et al., 1966)</ref>. Th-Th interactions are not observed in the spectra due to the amorphous nature of the sample.</p><p>Aqueous thorium carbonate spectra was fitted (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.A) using thorium pentacarbonato aqueous complex (Th(CO 3 ) 5 6-</p><p>) as a model <ref type="bibr">(Altmaier et al., 2006)</ref>. According to the results, ~9 oxygens appear to be coordinated to Thorium at 2.47 Å. The fit also suggests the presence of ~4.5 carbon atoms at 2.47 Å and ~4.5 oxygen atoms (O dist ) at 4.52 Å.</p><p>In the case of thorium gluconate and thorium isosaccharinate samples, the EXAFS spectra were fitted using the reference crystal structures of Mn(III) citrate <ref type="bibr">(Matzapetakis et al., 2000)</ref> and Na(I) isosaccharinate <ref type="bibr">(Bontchev and Moore, 2004</ref>).</p><p>In the aqueous thorium gluconate sample at pH=12 (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.B), aside from the Th-O shell at 2.42 Å (with a coordination number around 10), the next most intense feature corresponds to a Th-C interaction at 4.27 Å.</p><p>For the aqueous thorium isosaccharinate sample at the same pH (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.C), the Th-C contribution appears at 4.19 Å. No Th-Th interactions are observed in thorium-gluconate or thorium-isosaccharinate samples.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Principal component analysis indicates that no important differences are observed between the Th-gluconate spectra at pH=7.6 or pH=12, and that similar aqueous complexes are being formed at both pH values.</p><p>Likewise, no significant differences are observed in the spectra for thorium gluconate samples in the absence and presence of calcium. This may either indicate that the concentration of calcium in the samples is not high enough to allow the formation of a mixed calcium-thorium-gluconate complexes, or that Th-Ca path length is R&gt;4 Å. At such distances the large signal-to-noise ratio of the experimental data prevents a detailed analysis of the spectra.</p><p>Further work is still on going in order to both improve the fitting results and compare them with the data gathered from independent solubility experiments.  </p></div>
