<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The recovery of indium from polymetallic sulphide ores stands mainly on the zinc extraction from sphalerite, ZnS -prototype of the so-called "tetrahedral sulphides" where the metal ions fill half of the available tetrahedral sites in a cubic closest packing of sulphide anions. In solid solution, and not seldom along with tin, indium is carried also by excess-metal copper-rich tetrahedral sulphides. Once the anionic closest packing displays unfilled tetrahedral and octahedral interstices, an eventual tendency towards the settlement of metal-metal interactions between additional ions could be satisfied by filling closely located interstitial sites.</p><p>Previous XANES experiments to study the binding state of indium and tin in polymetallic sulphide ores <ref type="bibr">(EC-450 &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">EC-628, reports dated August 27, 2009 and</ref><ref type="bibr">August 23, 2010, respectively)</ref> have provided challenging results -namely, a similar general trend was observed for the In and Sn L 3 -edge XANES spectra, with two shoulders close to the edge and an extra "white line" preceeding the edge in the case of indium <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>With the aim of clarifying those spectral details, a polymetallic ore sample (LS 1 -428) from the still unexploited deposit of Lagoa Salgada in the Portuguese sector of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) -a large, if not the largest, complex ore body in Europe and a potential supplier of indium in years to come [2] -was studied in this experiment, along with additional model compounds: In 2 S 3 (a poorly crystalline spinel-type sulphide), In 2 Se 3 (a commercial multiphase selenide) and SnS, with sodium chloride type-structure. Electron microprobe (EPMA) results showed that the studied sample contains In-rich small sphalerite domains, along with stannite, within large tetrahedrite grains (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>As an attempt to locate In-rich nanophases, preliminary topochemical mappings of selected fragments collected from this ore sample were performed with the scanning X-ray microscope (SXM) at 3.7 and at 3.8 keV (before and after In L 3 -edge). Once the results were not conclusive, the sample section studied by EPMA (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), previously rough-hewed with a diamond paste in the laboratory, was also irradiated to trace the presence of indium; the optical difficulties in clearly distinguishing distinct domains within the very reflective ore mineral grains under the visible light video-microscope were in part overcome with the collaboration of beamline Scientists to accomplish detailed topochemical mappings.</p><p>The analysis of XRF spectra using PYMCA enabled to infer the possible host mineral of In-carrier nanodomains. Various points were irradiated to collect XANES spectra in fluorescence yield mode by scanning from 3.71 to 3.80 keV for In L 3 -edge, from 3.91 to 4.02 keV for Sn L 3 -edge and from 2.45 to 2.55 keV for S K-edge. Occasionally, XANES spectra from 3.33 to 3.50 keV for Ag L 3 -edge and from 3.60 to 3.64 keV for K K-edge were also collected. An indium metal foil and anhydrite (CaSO 4 ) were used for energy calibration.

Conversely, data collected for Sn are fairly poor (fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and no sphalerite grains could be identified through the collected S K-edge spectra (fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), despite having been located in the sample by EPMA (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).
