<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>There are several complementary methods able to visualize the internal structures of eyes in clinics. Each clinical intravital imaging method is particularly suited in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting a specific zone of the eye. Despite the significant technological progress, the realization of images of the entire eyeball at the micrometric resolution is yet an unsolved task both in clinical diagnostics and in laboratory research. With this respect, high resolution images of the eyeball would be extremely useful, even in preclinical research, in the study of different pathologies of the retina, the lens, the optical nerve etc. In this work we combined the state of the art of micro computed tomography technology with phase contrast imaging, an innovative highly sensitive technique well adapted to investigate soft tissues without the use of contrast agents; we applied the technique in the post-mortem analysis of monkey eyes and rabbit eyes. A 3D visualization of the entire globe has been obtained for the first time with unprecedented resolution. These images show the potential of phase contrast imaging applied to the vision organ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The success of this study open the way for in vivo imaging of the eye tissue with the highest levels of resolution and contrast, and the ability to visualize some of dynamic processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>The experiments were performed at the biomedical beamline (ID17) of ESRF. In order to apply the PBI technique, we used a quasi-monochromatic (ΔE/E ~ 10 -4 ) quasi-parallel (divergence &lt;=1 mrad horizontally (H), and &lt;&lt;0.1 mrad, vertically (V)) X-ray beam. The monochromatic beam was selected from the continuous spectrum produced by the 21-pole wiggler source by a Si double Laue crystal monochromator system, installed at ID17, which is tuneable between 25 to 150 keV (λ = 50-8 pm). The maximum beam footprint on the sample was 150x7 mm 2 (HxV). The propagation distance between the sample and the detector was set to 11 meters. In order to perform the tomography scan the sample was rotated in front of the beam and images (projections) were acquired at different angles. The detection system was a sCMOS PCO edge 5.5 camera (2560x2160 pixels) connected with a 1:2X optics, holding a 350 µm thick YAG-based scintillator screen to convert the X-rays into visible light. The imaging system pixel size was 3.2x3.2 µm 2 ; the detector Field of View (FoV) was about 8.2x7 mm 2 (HxV). Using the half-acquisition CT modality, the finally available FoV was of about 16x7 mm 2 . Due to the limited available vertical field of view, which was smaller than the sample, the volumetric image of the eye was obtained by displacing it vertically twice in between two CT acquisitions. The acquired images were reconstructed using the filtered-back projection algorithm after the application of the single defocused-image Paganin algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples:</head><p>Three kinds of samples were used in this experiment: a) formalin-fixed monkey eyes (Macaca fascicularis) enucleated post-mortem from adult specimens (embedded in an agar-agar preparation and included in transparent cylindrical plastic containers of 3 cm in diameter); b) enucleated eyes obtained post-mortem (immediately after enucleation were placed in a plastic cylinder containing a saline solution) from Oryctalagus cuniculus type HY107 rabbits and c) full heads from the same species (removed from the body post mortem, was fixed vertically in a specially designed holder, which allows to perform CT avoiding that the holder passes on FoV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dosimery:</head><p>We measured the dose delivered in the different experimental conditions. The air kerma was measured using an ionization chamber, PTW Type 31002 Semiflex Tube Chamber 0.125 cm 3 calibrated at PTB and connected to the UNIDOS module. The dose distribution for head was then computed using Monte Carlo simulations. The model used in the simulations consisted in an elliptical shape of the dimensions of the rabbit head and the average dose was calculated in the region corresponding to the eye. The obtained values of doses vary according to the experimental parameters used during the acquisition within a range of <ref type="bibr">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr">150]</ref> Gy. But preliminary results of time reduction down to few minutes for the image of the whole eyeball, and a consequent dose reduction down to ~2.5 Gy demonstrate that such reduction do not compromise the diagnostic significance of the images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>This study for the first time demonstrates the possibility of obtaining images of ocular structures using synchrotron radiation and phase-contrast imaging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The discussed method allows visualizing soft tissue with the highest resolution and contrast, including a full 3D-model, without damaging the object under study and without requiring the use of contrast agents. The received results show the possibility of carrying out a similar study in vivo for intravital eye tissue imaging with previously unattainable resolution and the ability to visualize certain dynamic processes.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Cross-section of the monkey eye, centered on the lens.
