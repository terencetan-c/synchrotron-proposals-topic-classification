<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This was a first experiment intended to explore whether microbeam grazing incidence diffraction could yield useful information on sample surfaces prepared within the Horizon 2020 Green Diamond project to produce ' all diamond' power transistors <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The results obtained exceeded our expectations as regards sensitivity of the method. So far, data from 3 of the 7 samples measured have been thoroughly analyzed, with the analysis of the remaining four now underway based on the data reduction methods developed for the first three samples. For this report, we only present reults from one of the samples, identified as GD01-1D. A unique feature of this sample amongst the seven measured is that separate surface areas underwent different plasma etching processes delimited by masking (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 left</ref>). This sample enables us to directly compare the effect of the type and depths of the surface treatments on the same substrate. This is important as we are aware of variability in the bulk lattice quality of the different sample substrates. As a result, the longest time measuring was devoted to sample GD01-1D.</p><p>Two types of measurements were performed -standard grazing incidence diffraction -zero incidence diffraction sample, and scanning down the sample edge surface.</p><p>Our goal was to analyze the extent of techniques used to planarize-polish plasma etching process was at dependence.

These maps are then used to generate line profiles of pseudo scans to analyze strain and mosaicity respectively via Gaussian fits. Grains with slightly different orientations were often observed, so line profiles were generated separately for each grain before the fitting procedure.

We have also analyzed the data from zones B, C and D of this sample and were able to conclude to what extent each process performed is effective at removing the damged layer. We were able to correlate the results measured from different samples to compare the etching techiques used by different consortium members, although exact conclusions are still under discussion. Interpretation is to some extent complicated by the unwanted diffraction from defects in the bulk previously referred to (to avoid this in future measurements we will use much higher quality type IIa diamond substrates).</p><p>In summary, this first 'exploration' attempt has turned out to be very fruitful in demonstrating the sensitivity of the grazing incidence diffraction method and providing quantitative results that concur largely with our prior knowledge concerning the uni-directional abrasive polishing methods used on these samples. For the future, we intend to use grazing incidence diffraction as a standard tool to characterize the damage caused by the polishing process and the effectiveness of our different surface treatment process. This will be necessary both for qualifying the substrate preparation and defects that may arise in the thick (~30µm) CVD overgrown doped diamond layers that are now being produced within the Green Diamond project.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 : (left) optical microscopy image showing the different etching processes and etch depths acquired during a rocking scan that are exploiting the large acceptance of the 2D</figDesc><graphic coords="2,246.48,294.48,275.64,234.00" type="vector_box" /></figure>
