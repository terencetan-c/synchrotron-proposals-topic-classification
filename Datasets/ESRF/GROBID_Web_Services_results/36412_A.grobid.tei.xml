Spatial resolutions: 0.28 µm/voxel and 0.7 µm/voxel; absorption only.</p><p>All the measured samples are related to the study of creep mechanisms acting on the short fiber reinforced AlSi12CuNiMg alloy. The aims of these investigations were:</p><p>a) The identification and characterization of the three-dimensional reinforcing network formed by the Si and the short fibers and its evolution after different exposure times. Due to the low contrast between certain constituent phases (i.e. Al-Si), different sampledetector distances were used to improve it. The phase-retrieval reconstruction method was applied as a possible solution. The so far obtained reconstruction using phase-retrieval is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 d</ref>). The contrast between Al and Si is still not enough to separate these phases and requires further improvement.</p><p>b) The identification of voids and intermetallic particles, the determination of their volume fraction and morphological evolution during creep exposure. a b c d</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig.1 a) to c) show reconstructed slices of the short fiber reinforced composite for detector-to-sample distances of 5, 20 and 50 mm, respectively.</figDesc></figure>
