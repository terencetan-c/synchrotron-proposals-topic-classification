It plays thus an important role in the protectio n of biomolecules from oxidative damage caused either by the radicals itself or by reactive oxygen species formed by superoxide. NiSOD was purified from Streptomyces seoulensis sp. nov. and from Streptomyces coelicolor <ref type="bibr">(ref. 1)</ref>. It was biochemically studie d and compared to the two already superoxide dismutases families of superoxide dismutases -one containing copper and zink <ref type="bibr">(CuZnSOD)</ref>, and the other one having iron (FeSOD) or manganese (MnSOD) in its redox-active metal centre. The NiSOD could not be assigned to any of the two groups and shows a distinct amino acid composition and sequence. Moreover, NiSOD shows a coordination environment of the metal centre which is unlike any other SOD, being composed of 3 S-ligands, one N -ligand and one other Nor O-liga nd, as determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy <ref type="bibr">(ref. 3)</ref>. In the course of this spectroscopic investigation it remained unclear whether the metal centre is mono or dinuclear and which residues are involved in the coordination of the metal ion.</p><p>We obtained crystals of NiSOD useful for X-ray diffraction in three different crystal forms. In April 2000 MAD data of high quality were collected at BM14, however, it was not possible to derive initial phases to interpret the electron density maps. This is most probably due to the presence of translational non-crystallographic symmetry in the used crystal form. At ID14-4 in July, another crystal form lacking the translational pseudosymmetry was used for MAD data collection from which the peak and inflection point data recently provided us with an interpretable map. SAD and 3λ MAD phasing were not successful, the latter due to severe radiation damage during the 'remote' data collection. In November data on all crystal forms were to be collected at BM14. On the orthorhombic crystals we collected data on a native and a NaBr-cryosoaked crystal. On small needle-shaped rhombohedral crystals no data were collected because of a too low signal to noise ratio and low beam intensity. In June 2001 a data collection at 2Å wavelength was performed at ID29 to utilise the anomalous signal of Sulphur (data processing in progress).</p><p>Model building into the electron density maps obtained with the MAD dataset on the crystal form lacking the translational pseudosymmetry is currently in progress.</p></div>

In the context of studies of periplasmic Cu,Zn SODs from pathogenic bacteria, we have undertaken structural characterisation of the enzyme from Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiological agent for the sexually transmitted human genital disease chancroid. The bacterium is unable to synthesise heme, and the role attributed to its Cu,Zn SOD is dual: protection from oxidative damage, and transport of heme. The characterisation of the enzyme namely suggest that a single heme moiety is bound to the functional Cu,Zn SOD dimer. We have successfully crystallised the enzyme in the apo and holo form (with and without the heme moiety) from PEG solutions in hanging drop conditions, and collected diffraction data on both enzyme forms on ID14-1 beamline. Both structures have been solved with molecular replacement techniques. In the case of holo enzyme, the electron density maps clearly show the presence of one heme moiety per dimer, as anticipated from biochemical studies of the enzyzme.</p><p>Street address: 6 rue Jules Horowitz, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex Telephone: +33 (0)4 7688 2552; Fax: +33 (0)4 7688 2020; e-mail: useroff@esrf.fr ESRF Experiment Report Form, July 1999 Compound: heme containing Cu,Zn SOD Crystal Native apo enzyme Native holo enzyme Space Group C2 P1 Unit cell a= 71.4 Å b= 64.0 Å c=.74.0 Å β = 118.0 a= 37.3 Å b=66.2 Å c=.69.2 Å α= 66.3 β= 89.7 γ= 75.8 Resolution 1.5 Å 1.5 Å Redundancy 3.9 1.5 Å Completeness 99.4% 91.7% Rsym 4.5% 6.7% I/σ (overall) 24.2 50.4</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>______________________________________________________________________________________</head><figDesc>Postal address: User Office, ESRF, B.P. 220, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex, France Street address: 6 rue Jules Horowitz, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex Telephone: +33 (0)4 7688 2552; Fax: +33 (0)4 7688 2020; e-mail: useroff@esrf.fr ESRF Experiment Report Form, July 1999</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In spring 2001 we collected datasets on: native crystals, native crystals co-crystallised with thiomersal, and on platinum soaked crystals of the E18K mutant. These experiments were performed on ID14-1 beamline. The datasets are not ideally complete because of radiation damage. Due to un-isomorphism between datasets, the data could not been successfully used for phasing, although we could identify heavy atom positions is the case of mercury derivatised crystals. </p></div>
