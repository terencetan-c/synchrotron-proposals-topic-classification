<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">IMPLEMENTING OF THE UV-VIS MICROSPECTROPHTOMETER ONLINE AT THE PILATUS SETUP AT BM01A</head><p>The UV-vis microspectrophotometer was previously made online on the MAR345 setup at BM01A, but with the upgrading to the PILATUS setup the system had to be rebuilt. Part of the beamtime was used together with the SNBL team to make a first prototype of a combined UV-vis, Raman and X-ray setup with the new diffractometer at BM01A. This resulted in a initial setup that was usable, and worked quite nice, but need to be further developed for optimal use. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MYOGLOBIN AND RADIATION DAMAGE</head><p>The main goal of this project has been to investigate the peroxidase reaction cycle in myoglobin (Mb) by trapping intermediates in the cycle. Two of the intermediates have been determined, the so-called compound II equivalent and the compound 0 equivalent as well as the resting state. Several of these states experience some radiation damage of the metal site as investigated by light absorption microspectrophotometry and online Raman spectroscopy at SNBL previously. This time, by using the new initial UV-vis/Raman/X-ray setup, we performed experiments with X-ray exposure together with real-time UV-vis spectroscopy monitoring of the radiation-damage to estimate the lifedoses with a shorter wavelength (0.7 Å) and lower flux than at standard protein beamlines. The effect of annealing above the glass transition temperature was also tested out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.FLAVODOXIN REDUCTASES FLD1 AND NRDI</head><p>There are three flavodoxins in B. Cereus that can represent the electron delivering system for both ribonucleotide reductase and nitric oxide synthase. We have previously solved the structure of FLD1 and NrdI, but several aspect remains to be assesed. When FLD1 and NrdI is chemically reduced a peptide flip of a glycine residue is observed above the flavin ring making a hydrogen bond to the flavin in the reduced state. If this flip can occur through X-ray induced reduction at low temperature, or if the crystal is heated above the glass transition temperature, was tried answered. Through the new setup a combined UV-vis monitoring, programmed temperature jumps, and several X-ray data sets collected at different points was performed. Additionally, chemically reduced data was collected as comparison.</p><p>All these studies were more test cases with the new setup, and these studies need to be complemented during the next beamtime.
