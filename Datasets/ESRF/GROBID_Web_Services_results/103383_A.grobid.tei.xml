<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental details XAS measurements were performed on Eu-doped calcium molybdate samples, obtained from two different synthetic methods (inverse miniemulsion and ball-milling syntheses), at Eu L3-edge (6977 eV) and at Mo Kedge (20000 eV). In situ experiments were performed using the Microtomo furnace, which allows to follow the evolution of the absorbing species during the annealing process up to 900 °C either in He flow, in vacuum or in air flow. The samples were heated from room temperature (RT) up to 900°C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min, holding the temperature for 2 h. Measurements at Eu L3-edge were performed in fluorescence mode, where EXAFS spectra were acquired in the range 6850-7550 eV at RT before and after annealing, and XANES spectra were measured in the range 6850-7200 eV while heating and cooling the sample (acquisition time per spectrum ca. 6 min, temperature step per spectrum ca. 65 °C). Measurements at Mo K-edge were performed in transmission mode in the range 19700-21700 eV. The evolution of gaseous species during the annealing process was followed in situ by mass spectrometer (MS). The samples were prepared as pure pellet, to avoid the interference of a binder (e.g. BN) during the annealing process. Ex situ experiments were performed at both edges collecting EXAFS spectra of reference and pre-treated pelletized samples. The original proposal aimed at collecting also XRD patterns, but due to technical problems the XRD detector was not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The goal of this experiment was twofold: i) understand the transformation on the electronic and short-range structure of the doping ions and the matrix during the annealing process in inert atmosphere (He flow) and ii) to unravel the origin of the different behaviours of the samples during this process, arising from the different synthetic routes exploited to obtain the final product, i.e. inverse miniemulsion (wet chemistry) and ball-milling (solid-state chemistry). Eu-doped CaMoO4 with 1 and 5 at. % (calculated as at. % Eu/Mo), from miniemulsion and ball-milling synthesis were tested. Considering the in situ experiments at the Eu L3-edge, the XANES spectra (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>) clearly show a partial reduction of Eu 3+ to Eu 2+ during the annealing process from RT to 900 °C in He flow for all samples investigated, namely samples with different Eu amount (1 and 5 at. %) and from different synthetic methods. Going more into details, considering the XANES spectra, the Eu 3+ peak at 6983 eV decreases in intensity during annealing (RT to 900 °C) whereas the intensity of Eu 2+ shoulder at 6876 eV increases. Upon cooling the system from 900 °C to RT, the Eu 2+ shoulder decreases and the Eu 3+ peak increases in intensity, meaning that part of the Eu 2+ is re-oxidised to Eu 3+ when lowering the temperature. However, the reduction and oxidation process of Eu 3+ is not completely reversible, as a small quantity of Eu 2+ in still present (presence of Eu 2+ shoulder) even at RT after annealing and even after exposing the sample to air. The presence of Eu 2+ in Eu-doped samples was also confirmed by ex situ measurements on samples previously annealed at home institution and exposed to air for days. In addition, samples after annealing in He flow appear of a black colour and no longer show the characteristic red luminescence of the Eu 3+ upon excitation in the UV (λexc=254 nm). Moreover, a higher amount of Eu 2+ is formed when heating in He flow samples with a higher Eu content, i.e. 5 at. % as compared to 1 at. % samples. However, even though the formation of Eu 2+ during annealing in He flow was observed in all cases, some differences comparing the samples from the two synthetic approaches are worth to be highlighted, even though macroscopically (e.g., crystallite size) the samples are similar. Indeed, considering as an example the 5 at. % samples, the extent and the kinetic of the reduction of Eu 3+ to Eu 2+ is significantly different. In particular, for miniemulsion sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), the formation of Eu 2+ starts at lower temperatures (300 °C) and the maximum amount of Eu 2+ is higher (ca. 60 % of the total Eu content). On the other hand, the ball-milling sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) shows a significant lower amount of Eu 2+ , but a lower decrease in its content when heating from 700 to 900 °C. During the heating, a strong increase in the absorption step was observed between 500-700 °C. We excluded the cause to be a displacement of the sample or a change in absorber concentration due to matrix evaporation, as it was also observed when measuring the samples at Mo K-edge. Therefore, this observation can be related to a possible structural change in the sample, both for ball-milling and miniemulsion samples.</p><p>In situ experiments at the Mo K-edge were performed on undoped and 5 at. % doped samples, obtained from both the synthetic methods. For all samples, changes in the XANES profile upon heating from RT to 900 °C in He were observed, even though in this case the transformations are reversible, as by cooling the system to RT the features in the XANES are restored. The detailed analysis of these changes is ongoing. During all the in situ measurements, the evolution of gaseous species was followed by MS. At intermediate temperatures the formation of H2 was detected in He flow, and this can be correlated with the formation of Eu 2+ and possible structural changes during the heating from 500 to 700 °C. Further selected in situ experiments were performed in air or under vacuum. As expected, the annealing in air gives little to no reduction of Eu 3+ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and future work</head><p>The preliminary analysis of the data demonstrates that the annealing process in inert atmosphere (He flow) allows the partial reduction of Eu 3+ to Eu 2+ , with different degree depending on the different synthetic methods. However, it is still not completely clear which is the driving force for this reduction mechanism and the stabilisation of Eu 2+ in the crystal structure. Nonetheless, even though the data collected are very informative, they opened further questions on this investigation. Further experiments on samples with a higher Eu content (10 at. %) and combined in situ XAS-XRD measurements are crucial to clarify and fully understand the reduction mechanism and the transformations on the short-and long-range structure occurring during the annealing, especially in the temperature range 500-700 °C.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 a,b) Eu L3-edge XANES spectra collected in situ during annealing in He flow from RT to 900 °C and c,d) quantification of the Eu 3+ (red)/Eu 2+ (grey) amount during this annealing process for 5 at. % doped miniemulsion (a,c) and ball milling (b,d) samples, respectively.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,35.50,190.14,543.77,114.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
