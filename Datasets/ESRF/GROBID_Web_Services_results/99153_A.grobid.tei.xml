<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>To study the in-plane structures of the grown layers we have performed synchrotron-based grazing incidence diffraction (GID) at the Spanish beamline SpLine, BM25B at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble. GID serves as a highly surface sensitive technique to probe in-plane lattice parameters and their azimuthal distribution in thin layers. If the angle of incidence is close or even smaller than the critical angle for total external reflection the impinging X-ray wave field decays exponentially with increasing depth. In this scattering geometry the diffraction plane stands upright to the surface normal and therefor GID implements the most non-coplanar case. An X-ray wavelength of 0.729 A, corresponding to a photon energy of 18 keV, has been selected by a Si(111) monochromator, in order to access a comparatively large area in reciprocal space. There are two more ring-like contributions detectable in the map and in the attached line profile taken at K=0, which cannot be related to FGT. These are most probably due to a smaller, non-intentional fraction of tetragonal FeTe agreeing very well with FeTe( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">220</ref>) in-plane lattice spacing.</p><p>Interestingly the c-axis of tetragonal FeTe points along the surface as well.</p><p>Complementary to GID we have performed omega/2theta measurement, which probes exclusively out-of-plane features of the layer, see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref>. A set of FeTe(00l) reflections confirms the presence of tetragonal FeTe with its out-of-plane orientation along SiC[00.1] as can already be anticipated from the GID in-plane data. A further set of eight subsequent FGT(00.l) reflections with l = 3, 6, .., 24 proves (in conjunction with the presented inplana data) the formation of Fe5GeTe2. The position and intensity ratios fit well with a numerically derived powder pattern (black bars). Based on the positions of the most intense contributions at l=3, 6, 18 and 21 we have deduced an out-of-plane lattice parameter of 29.16(9) A. We might emphasize that a potential formation of [00.1]-oriented Fe3GeTe2 can be excluded due to a well distinguishable, different diffraction pattern. This paragraph will be part of a forthcomming publication (close to submission) with the title Large-area synthesis of ferromagnetic Fe5-xGeTe2/graphene van der Waals heterostructures with Curie temperature above room temperature. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2 (Degree)  Intensity (a.u.)

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(a) shows the in-plane intensity distribution plotted in hexagonal coordinates according to the symmetry of the SiC(00.1) substrate. For convenience we use the four-component vector notation for hexagonal symmetry: (h k . l) = (h k -[h+k] l). The only substrate contribution within the investigated area in reciprocal space appears as a single (2-1.0)-type of reflection. All further features are either caused by the grown layers, which form hexagonal FGT, tetragonal FeTe and, as a protecting cap, hexagonal Te. This topmost layer yields a sequence of low-index poly-rings with different lattice spacings. However, the most intense and prominent diffraction feature originates from the FGT layer itself. There are two different sets of reflections, namely FGT(11.0) and (22.0), and FGT(h0.0) with [h=1..3]. Please note that both refer to an orientation with its c-axis along the surface normal. The three most intense diffraction features at (11.0), (22.0) and (30.0) result in a FGT in-plane lattice parameter of 4.049(13) A. The intensity modulation along the FGT(11.0) ring depicts maxima if the azimuth fits with the SiC[2-1.0] substrate direction indicating a preferential in-plane orientation, i.e. the FGT[11.0] net planes are aligned with SiC[11.0].</figDesc></figure>

Contributions along particular rings (corresponding to discrete in-plane lattice parameters) can be well attributed to FGT, FeTe and the Te capping layer. The out-of-plane omega/2theta scan contains a series of FGT peaks, which intensities match well with the calculated ones.</figDesc></figure>
