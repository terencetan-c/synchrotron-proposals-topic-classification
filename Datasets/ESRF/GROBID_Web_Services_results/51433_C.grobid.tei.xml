<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>The proposed study aims at determining uranium speciation in bottom-lake sediments downstream of a former U-mining site in Northern Massif Central, France. EXAFS and XANES spectroscopy are used to identify the nature of the deposited U-bearing phases and to follow the possible changes in uranium speciation after deposition in relation with redox cycling at and below the water sediment interface. These issues are addressed thanks to the study of bottom lake sediment cores carefully collected and preserved from oxidation.</p><p>The knowledge of uranium speciation in such contaminated lake sediments is critical to our evaluation of the efficiency of U sequestration in these sediments over the last decades and these information are of key importance to improve the management of such lakes.</p><p>XANES data were recorded at the U L-III edge on a large series of sediment samples with U concentrations ranging between 50 and 300 mg/kg U, in fluorescence detection mode using a 13 elements Ge array detector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). These data indicate significant changes in U oxidation state with depth in the sediment, which could be quantified by linear decomposition of the XANES data using appropriate model compounds data prepared for this experiement and that were analyzed during the same beamtime. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>)</p><p>Due to high Fe fluorescence background in the samples studied, EXAFS data could only be collected on the most concentrated sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The analysis of uranium speciation in these samples is under progress. Data will be fit using linear combinations of U(IV) and U(VI) model compound spectra collected during this beamtime and which are relevant of U speciation in sediments.</p><p>Complementary analyzes, including spatially resolved U spectroscopy might be necessary to fully determine U speciation in these complex natural samples.

The change in the energy position of the absorption edge and in the shape of the XANES structure indicates changes in the U oxidation state with depth. The shoulder at 17190 eV is especially indicative of the multiple scattering within the axial [O=U=O] 2+ uranyl molecule, the most common form of U(VI).</figDesc></figure>
