<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This first experiment on 3d Metal Oxides was devoted to the L/S determination in NiO. Essentially the non resonant magnetic X-ray scattering techniques were used. However a quick survey through the k-edge of Ni has revealed a strong magnetic resonance.</p><p>The outstanding result of this work is the proof of existence of an orbital moment on the Ni ion. The orbital moment contributes 17f3% to the magnetization density. This determination of the orbital moment contribution to the total magnetizationin the antiferromagnetically ordered state of NiO is a valuable piece of information for a better understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of the 3d metal oxides [l].</p><p>The experiment was performed at two different energies (784keV and 17.41 keV) in the non-resonant regime, far off the k-edge of Ni (8.33keV). All measurements were done at room temperature. At this temperature NiO (T~=523K) is ordered in a type II antiferromagnetic structure, with the magnetic moments ferromagnetically aligned in the (111) planes that are stuck antiferromagnetically. The crystal was mounted on the four-circle diffractometer with the (111) axis in the scattering plane and parallel to the 4 axis. This geometrie gave us access to the different S-domains corresponding to the threefold symmetry of the (111) planes. We were looking for three different magnetic reflections (iif), (iii) and (4::) and made polarization analysis on each of them. We also looked at non-specular reflections but their intensities were extremely weak compared to the specular ones. The sample seemed to be single T-domain.</p><p>All of the reflections showed a rotated intensity I,, which evidenced the magnetic nature of the signal. Spin and orbital moment contribute to the rotated part, whereas only the spin contributes to the non-rotated part of the intensity. This difference allowed us to measure the orbital moment. By rotating the sample around the surface normal, we could study the S domain distribution within the [ill] T-domain. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the modulation of the three domains in ~7r and (~0 of a (42;) reflection. We found out that all three S domains where populated and that the size of these domains are of order of the footprint size. The 7r/2 shift between the two polarized components show that spin and orbital moment are collinear. By averaging the intensities of the three different reflections, L/S can be calculated. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the result obtained. The continuous line is the Q-dependence estimated by Blume <ref type="bibr">(ref 1.)</ref>. By extrapolating to Q=O the orbital contribution of the magnetization density can be estimated to be 17%. This experiment was made possible because of the high flux of high-polarized x-rays on ID20. The future project will be on resonant magnetic scattering from transition metal oxides.  These results will be published in Phys. rev. B 57 April 1998. Reference: [l] M. Blume, <ref type="bibr">Phys Rev. 124, 96 (1961)</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Normalized integrated intensities of the (iii) reflection as a function of Renninger angle q5 at 7.84keV.</figDesc></figure>
