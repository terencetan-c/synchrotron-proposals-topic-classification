<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In general: The experiment was carried remotely. Our local contact, Veijo Honkimäki, did the experiments at ID31 personally due to covid-19 pandemic. Also due to the covid-19 pandemic, the changes of the both applicants each to new affiliations and also difficulties in downloading and opening the data (new format) this report is late. The beamtime was prolonged to the 2 nd May 2021 due to technical problems at the beginning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments:</head><p>The samples were sent to the ESRF. The delivered samples had a square cross section of 2  2 mm², a length of 15 mm and were cut longitudinally from single-crystals with an axial orientation close to [001]. The prepared samples were glued on a sample holder and mounted in a furnace by the local contact. After alignment measurements, the samples were heated up to 1100 °C stepwise (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and then also stepwise cooled down. To prevent oxidation, the diffraction measurements were carried under argon atmosphere at given temperatures during heating and cooling.</p><p>The The measurements were carried out in X-rays with energy E = 77.502 keV in transmission mode.</p><p>The diffraction pattern were recorded using a Pilatus3 2M camera, with a resolution of 1475  1679 pixel and pixel size of 172 m. The measurement data were stored at the ESRF and then downloaded by the applicants for processing, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The data were opened using the silx view program, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. After viewing in silx view, the diffractograms were saved in the usual TIF format needed for their quantitative processing. In the first step, a calibration measurement using a powder of cerium (IV) oxide CeO2 with a cubic (fluorite) lattice, having the parameter a = 5.41 Å was carried out (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows a 1475  1679 pixel resolution diffractogram recorded from sample A7 at room temperature. As can be seen, the image of X-ray reflection on the diffractogram is very weak. However, by slecting a local 231  186 pixel area around the reflection, a distinguishable profile of its integral intensity can be obtained, see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.

All planned experiments have been performed. Due to some reasons X-ray reflections recorded from the samples have very low intensities. Processing such noisy reflections needs the development of special software. However, the development of such software takes a long time.After obtaining the required results, it is planned to write and publish a paper which will be submitted to the ERSF.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,154.25,499.37,292.50,170.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
