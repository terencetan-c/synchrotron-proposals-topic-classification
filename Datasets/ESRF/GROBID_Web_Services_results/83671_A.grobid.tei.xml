<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Abstract</head><p>We report an in situ and real-time investigation on growth kinetics and mixing behavior of binary codeposited small-molecule organic semiconductor thin films by organic molecular beam deposition as a function of mixing ratio, growth temperature and substrate material using X-Ray Diffraction techniques. We use pentacene (PEN) as a donor component and N,N0-1H,1H-perfluorobutyl-cyanoperylenediimide (PDIF-CN 2 ) as an acceptor component revealing different growth behavior. We observed a strong tendency to a mixed crystal formation between the donor and the acceptor molecules governed by intermolecular interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Results</head><p>We performed monitoring of thin films growth in an Ultra high Vacuum mobile chamber in real time using two detectors: a 2D PILATUS 300k and a point detector. The films were simultaneously grown on two different substrates: a non-interacting silicon wafer with a native oxide and a SiC wafer with an interacting graphene monolayer on top (Figures <ref type="figure">a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>). When grown on SiO x both compounds (PEN and PDIF-CN 2 ) prefer a standing up-right molecule orientation as well as their mixed phase obtained by equimolar co-evaporation. In contrast, on graphene PEN is adsorbing in lying down manner, however, the acceptor molecules and the mixed phase maintain the unit cells observed on SiO x , that confirms the stronger π-π intermolecular interaction in face-on stacks in comparison with the herringbone lattice of PEN. The substrate temperature affects the crystallinity of PDIF-CN 2 films so that PDIF-CN 2 and 1:1 films are almost amorphous at room temperature. When deposited at 70 °C the 1:1 film reveals a wellordered mixed crystal (Figure <ref type="figure">c</ref>). By changing the mixing ratio the growth behavior varies from phase separation between the crystalline PEN and the mixed crystal in a film with PEN excess to unstructured intermixing in a film with disordered PDIF-CN 2 excess. In films with dominating PEN its bulk phase was observed. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Remarks on quality of measurements</head><p>We found the ID10 beamline particularly suited for our real-time experiments with weakly scattering organic materials. We used two kinds of the detectors (PILATUS 300K and point detector) which allowed obtaining excellent results in the framework of our study, although a detector with a larger amount of pixels could reduce the measurement time.</p></div>
