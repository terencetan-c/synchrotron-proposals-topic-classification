During the measurement, we met several problems. The first problem was getting the coordinate of samples. Although the Te concentration is up to 2.5%, it is still too low compared to the Si substrate since the beam go through the whole sample. To solve this problem, the deterors and the incident angles were adjusted so many times, finally the samples position was obtained. However, the second problem comes, the detected signal was too weak for EXAFS experiment, which is resulted by the low Te concentration. We tried the Te-2.5%-PLM and thick layer Te-2.0% that have more Te atoms and thicker layer sample may have strong signal. After 3 hours scanning, we got some results and Dr. Andreas tried to analyze them.</p><p>Here we have the third problem, there are some undertrained peaks showing in the spectral, randomly appeared around the K edge of Te (31.8 keV), this makes difficulty to fitting and analysis the spectral. We thought they may come from the samples or the detector element affect by large Bragg reflections from substrate after we checked the incident and exit beam, this is also mentioned in the paper about EXAFS experiment for Se doped Si. The solution reported was arranged samples at less than a 5 angle of incidence for the incoming beam, but this resulted in a small cross sectional area on the surface of samples, subsequently signal becomes weak again. So we spent a lot time to adjust the angle that suitable for avoiding background noise and showing strong enough signal to do the EXAFS measurement. Finally we chose sample Te-2.5%-PLM and set it to a suitable angle for overnight scanning to get more data points that may remove the Bragg reflection from average signal, unfortunarly we still have the weird peaks after 12 hours scanning, this may due to the incident beam energy is too high, almost three times of EXAFS experiment for Se K edge. On 06 July 2017, we did the calibration again and redo the experiment, but it did not make any sense. The experiment is stopped on 06 July 2017.</p></div>		</body>
