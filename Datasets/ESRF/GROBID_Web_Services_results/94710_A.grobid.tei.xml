<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Was the local support adequate?</head><p>YES. The support of the local contact, D. Hermida Merino and of the technical staff, was adequate and allowed us to efficiently run the experiments. We had technical problems with one of the heaters in our jump stage (due to the transportation) and the local support staff helped very well to solve this defect so that we could still perform our measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned in the project</head><p>proposal? YES. All the experimental data collected at BM26-B allowed us to study the effect of various initial combinations of mesophase precursors as well as Œ± and Œ±' homocrystals on stereocomplex crystallization and to derive crystallisation kinetics models for the crystallization of PLA and its stereocomplex formation. The outcome of the experiments is briefly described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>We have used a custom-modified Linkam JHT350 temperature jump-stage to apply fast temperature jumps. This device contains two thermally separated heating blocks whereby the sample can be rapidly transferred from one stage (e.g. preconditioning temperature) to the second stage, at the temperature desired for the investigation (e.g. crystallization temperature). The commercial device was modified with a remotely controlled pressure valve to complete the 'jump' of the sample from the first to the second heating block reproducibly within tenths of a second. A sample consists of a simple compression moulded ~50 Œºm thick plate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Experiments were conducted on PLLA/PDLA 50/50 Vol.% blends. The sample was placed on the preconditioning block for a specified amount of time at three different temperatures (80 ¬∫C, 100 ¬∫C, and 120 ¬∫C) to form Œ±', Œ±'+Œ± and Œ± homocrystals and mesophases. Subsequently, the sample was quickly transferred to the crystallization block to follow SC crystal formation in time at 190 ¬∫C and 215 ¬∫C by collecting WAXS and SAXS data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The crystal types of PLLA/PDLA blends which are generated upon melt crystallization are dependent on the crystallization time and temperature. ùõº and Œ± type homocrystals are formed at 80 ¬∫C and 120 ¬∫C respectively. In addition, melt crystallization at 100 ¬∫C leads to the formation of a mixture of ùõº and Œ± type. Also, stereocomplex mesophases can be generated by annealing the sample at 120 ¬∫C for a short time (less than 1 minute). Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref> presents WAXS profiles obtained simultaneously with SAXS measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) of the ùõº , ùõº +Œ±, Œ±, and SC mesophases, which are the starting point for SC crystallization in the PLLA/PDLA blends. The homocrystals or mesophase precursors convert to SC crystals at elevated temperature. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, the preformed homocrystals (in this case Œ±-form) melt and recrystallize to SC crystals immediately after changing the place of the sample from the cold-stage to the hot-stage. To determine the degree of crystallinity at each timepoint, the total intensity was deconvoluted into the amorphous and crystalline contributions as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>. It is interesting to investigate the effect of crystallization temperature on the kinetics of stereocomplex crystallization from different sources. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>, the degrees of stereocomplexation obtained at 190 ¬∫C and 215 ¬∫C are shown. It can be seen that melting and recrystallization of homocrystals can facilitate stereocomplex formation at both the low and high crystallization temperature. In addition, stereocomplexation from the ùõº -type of homocrystals is ultrafast whereas homo recrystallization of the ùõº and Œ± mixture leads to a higher amount of stereocomplex crystals. a) b) Figure 2: a) WAXS and b) SAXS profiles of stereocomplex crystal precursors. b) a) Figure 4: a) Lorentz-corrected SAXS patterns for samples crystalized for 120 min at 190¬∞C and 215¬∞C, b) Normalized correlation function.</p><p>SC crystalline lamellar structures crystallized at different temperatures were investigated via SAXS. Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref> shows the Lorentz-corrected SAXS profiles of the different samples after 120 minutes of crystallization at 190 ¬∫C and 215 ¬∫C respectively. To determine the morphological parameters, the Lorentz-corrected SAXS profile was inverse-cosine Fourier transformed to a one dimensional correlation function. The determination of the long period (Lp) and lamellar layer thickness (Lc) from the 1D-correlation function is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>. In all cases, both Lp and Lc considerably increase by increasing the crystallization temperature. Comparing the lamellar layer thickness, it can be concluded that the smallest stereocomplex crystals are formed from homo recrystallization of the ùõº -type, both at low and high stereocomplexation temperature. Currently, atomic force microscopy measurements are on-going to get more information about the crystalline microstructure.</p><p>In conclusion, we successfully performed a systematic study of the crystal growth and transformation in PLLA/PDLA stereocomplex forming mixtures by coupling a custom-modified Linkam JHT350 temperature jump-stage with SAXS/WAXS techniques. Our custom-designed setup allowed quick temperature jumps with the possibility for high-frequency structure characterization. The results indicate that using melt-recrystallization of homocrystals to form stereocomplex crystals is a quite promising method to achieve improved stereocomplex crystallization rates and to expand the application areas of PLA. Future efforts will focus on using additional characterization techniques such as rheometry and calorimetric measurements for further understanding the intricate crystallization behaviour of the PLLA/PDLA blend system.</p></div>
