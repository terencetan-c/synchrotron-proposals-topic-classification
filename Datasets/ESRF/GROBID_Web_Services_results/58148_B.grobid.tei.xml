<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this study, high-quality and thin III-nitride tubes having a wall only composed of GaN/InAlN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) are fabricated by a simple full nitride metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy approach. The synthesis of such MQW-tubes is based on the c-axis vertical GaN wire growth surrounded with coreshell MQWs heterostructure followed by a selective etching using in situ controlled H 2 /NH 3 annealing to remove the inner GaN wire (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Well-defined MQW-based tubes having non-polar m-plane orientation exhibit significant UV light emission near 330 nm up to the room temperature. The strain involved in non-etched and etched (tubes) structures have been measured by GIXRD and measurements of truncation rods. As already shown by our group, GaN wire templates are in epitaxy on the sapphire substrate and Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) has been used to confirm the in-plane 30° rotation between the two unit cells, i.e. 1 0 1 0 $%&amp; ∥ [1 1 2 0] +%,. and 0 0 0 1 $%&amp; ∥ [0 0 0 1] *%+. . Experiments have been performed on as-grown and etched GaN/InAlN core-shell samples with 9.5 keV photon energy (l=0.13051 nm) at the BM32 beamline of the European Synchrotron (ESRF in Grenoble). A sample with bare GaN wires has also been measured to provide a reference. The grazing incidence angle is set to 0.15 °, i.e. lower than the critical angle of refraction (around 0.24° at this energy) to strongly enhanced the intensity diffracted by the wires/tubes with respect to the substrate surface. The samples are aligned with respect to the usual hexagonal c-plane sapphire surface unit cell (a=0.4758 nm, c=1.2991 nm) to define an orientation matrix that uses (HKL) Saph. Miller indexes and sapphire reciprocal lattice (rlu). This choice allows accurate scanning of the reciprocal space. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows in-plane diffraction scans along the a) [H 0 0] Sap. direction exhibiting the (H 0 0) GaN reflection due to epitaxial relationship and b) [H H 0] Sap. direction to measure the (H 0 0) GaN reflection (see larger scans showing sapphire peaks in supplementary materials). The in-plane interatomic distances corresponding to the usual ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) GaN interplanar distances can be measured in the three samples. They correspond to the GaN core, even for the "tube sample", which is not completely etched. Moreover, an additional peak is measured at larger rlu that we attribute to the GaN/AlGaN shell and more precisely to the 0-order peak of the MQW.</p><p>The peak broadening of the core-shell "wire" sample (non etched and wit MQW) is wider and probably correspond to a mixing of different contributions including AlGaN substrate overgrowth. The etching of the wires provides a narrower peak with a stronger contrast clearly defined both for the ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) reflections (see arrows). From the direct measurement of the peak positions with respect to the GaN internal reference, we can deduce a decrease of the average interplanar distances by about -0.44 % for these two plane families suggesting a smaller InAlN lattice parameter than bulk GaN. The interpretation in terms of composition inside the InAlN layer is difficult because it must take into account the nature of the MQW (thickness and composition) as well as anisotropic strain and relaxation. This work will be focused in another studies. Nevertheless, this diffraction result suggests that the GaN quantum well layer inside the InAlN/GaN MQW of the "tube sample" should be in tension to balance the average strain corresponding to the average peak. As also shown in supplementary materials, grazing incidence angle measurements of crystal truncation rods along the l direction for (h,k) values indicated by #1,2,3,4 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> have confirmed a smaller value of the average lattice parameter along the -c growth direction with a decrease of -1.15 % (resp. -1.3 %) for the measurements along (1 1 l) for the "tube" and "wire" samples. These recults motivate also our group to perform finite element calculations to simulate the general tendancies of this new type of relaxation by changing the relative quantum well and quantum barrier thicknesses.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Formation of MQW-tubes after an uncompleted wire etching by the in situ H 2 /NH 3 annealing of GaN wires coated with radial 10x GaN/InAlN MQWs. a,b) STEM images at 20 kV of dispersed MQW-tubes on holey carbon membrane having a tube wall thicknesses of 70 nm corresponding to the expected thickness of 10 MQWs. c) Schematic of the etch mechanism by the in situ H 2 /NH 3 annealing in the case of thick MQW shell.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,44.94,463.50,315.60,210.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
