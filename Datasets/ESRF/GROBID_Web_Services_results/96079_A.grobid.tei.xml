<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The present study is motivated by the search for an ideal realization of j = ½ moments in 5d 5 iridates. These spin-orbit-entangled moments are the microscopic source of, e.g., Kitaev exchange on a tricoordinated lattice. The ideal j=½ wave function is found in a cubic crystal field while non-cubic contributions yield a finite admixture of j = 3/2 character. RIXS at the Ir L3 edge is a powerful tool to detect such deviations from cubic symmetry via the related splitting of the spin-orbit exciton, i.e., the excitation from the local j = ½ ground state to a j = 3/2 excited state. Cubic symmetry on the Ir site is found in structural studies of, e.g., Ba2CeIrO6 where RIXS nevertheless shows a splitting of the spin-orbit exciton of about 100 meV <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The discrepancy can be explained by assuming that the distortions are local, exhibiting a negligible correlation length, such that the average global structure seen in elastic scattering still shows cubic symmetry. This, however, raises a fundamental question: Is there an electronic mechanism that drives j = ½ systems away from cubic symmetry? For Ba2CeIrO6, one example could be magneto-elastic coupling, lifting the frustration on the fcc lattice [1]. Even small deviations from the j = ½ wave function -with a small cost of lattice energy -may give rise to massive bond-dependent changes of exchange couplings and a large gain in magnetic energy. In the quest for exotic j = ½ spin liquids it is of general importance to understand whether j = ½ compounds avoid frustration in this way. An alternative explanation may be the presence of defects. To adress this issue, we measured RIXS at the L3 edge on two globally cubic (fcc) 5d 5 model systems for frustrated quantum magnetism with potentially ideal j = ½ moments, antifluorite-type K2IrCl6 and the double perovskite Ba2PrIrO6. In both cases, we measured on a (111) surface with an energy resolution of about 25 meV.</p><p>In K2IrCl6, we focus on the temperature dependence since the spitting of the (rather local) spin-orbit exciton should not depend strongly on q, in agreement with the results on Ba2CeIrO6 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Moreover, the Mott gap of K2IrCl6 is larger than 1 eV, which allowed us to study the spin-orbit excition also in infrared transmittance, where we performed a thorough analysis of the temperature dependence. The infrared data show strong phonon sidebands, and the spin-orbit exciton can only be studied in a phonon-assisted process, offering complementary information to RIXS. For a meaningful comparison of the two data sets, we measured RIXS at 10, 100, 200, and 300 K at the X point (8 8 5), see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> above. At 10 K, the RIXS data are dominated by a single peak at 0.64 eV. However, also K2IrCl6 shows an additional (weak) feature at about 0.68 eV, and the relative intensity of this mode rises with increasing temperature. We expect that a combined analysis of RIXS and optics will yield the strength of the coupling to phonons and unravel the role of magneto-elastic coupling.</p><p>The double perovskite Ba2PrIrO6 orders magnetically at TN = 71 K. Note that this implies a reduction of the crystal symmetry below TN. Here, we also measured RIXS data at 10, 100, 200, and 300 K, focusing on the X point (7 6 6) and the L point (6.5 6.5 5.5), see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> below. The measurements were time consuming since we used a step size of 5 meV and had to average over several scans to obtain a smooth data set with welldefined features. Like K2IrCl6, also Ba2PrIrO6 shows a splitting of the spin-orbit exciton, a remarkable result.</p><p>At the L point, we observe one dominant peak with only a small second mode, similar to the data of K2IrCl6 (there at the X point). At the X point, however, Ba2PrIrO6 shows a further feature on the low-energy side which is most pronounced at 10 K. It is tempting to speculate that such additional features are caused by the interaction with the Pr j = 5/2 moments. Furthermore, the splitting of the spin-orbit exciton in the oxides Ba2PrIrO6 and Ba2CeIrO6 equals about 100 meV and is thus roughly a factor 2 larger than in the chloride K2IrCl6, pointing towards a possible origin in terms of phonon sidebands. A thorough analysis will have to show whether the lineshape can be related to the (highest) phonon energies in these compounds.</p><p>Remarkably, both globally cubic compounds studied here exhibit a splitting of the spin-orbit exciton. We expect that these results, in combination with our optical data, will allow us to unravel the origin of this surprising behavior.</p><p>Using the spin-orbit exciton in Ba2PrIrO6 as an example for a rather local excitation, we studied the possibility to measure with four spherically diced analyzer crystals in parallel. In principle, each analyzer yields a signal on a separate part of the 2D detector. The aim was to enhance the efficiency of the beam time, acquiring data at different q in parallel. However, we found that spurious signals from the additional analyzers spill into the signal, giving rise to artifacts such as small "sidebands" in the line shape. Since the present study is focussed on the line shape of the spin-orbit excition, we continued the measurements with a single analyzer.</p><p>A further goal was to find signatures of magnons in Ba2PrIrO6 since the high ordering temperature 71 K points towards large exchange couplings. The figure shows low-energy data from to L at 10 K. The elastic line is suppressed for 2 = 90°. The data at (6.2 6.2 6.2) are closest to this ideal case and indeed show the smallest intensity at zero loss. Note that the zero of energy loss was calibrated by reference measurements with a large elastic line. We find a magnon peak at about 20 meV that shows a small dispersion. Close to , at (6.01 6.01 6.01), the elastic line dominates and corroborates the position of zero loss.</p><p>Resolving these low-energy magnons in Ir L edge RIXS is a major success of this beam time.</p><p>[1] A.
