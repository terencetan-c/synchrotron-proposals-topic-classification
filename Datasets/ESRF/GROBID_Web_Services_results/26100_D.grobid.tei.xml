<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The heteroepitaxial growth of MAX phase Ti 2 AlN (M n+1 AX n with M = Ti, A = Al, X = N and n = 1) on single crystal substrates MgO(001) and <ref type="bibr">MgO(111)</ref>, deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering from Ti and Al targets in an Ar/N 2 atmosphere at a temperature of 690 °C, has been studied in situ. Using real-time specular x-ray reflectivity, layer-by-layer growth first of an approximately 10 nm thick epitaxial fcc Ti 0.63 Al 0.37 N seed layer, then, after changing the deposition parameters, of the MAX phase itself was observed, with an increased surface-roughening on MgO(001) substrate. Using off-plane Bragg-Brentano xray scattering, the pseudomorphic growth of Ti 2 AlN to the underlying seed-layer as well as MgO was established with lattice parameters of c = 1.3463 nm and a = 0.2976 nm. From ex-situ pole figures at a laboratory source the epitaxial relationship between film and substrate lattice was determined to be MgO {111}&lt;110&gt; // Ti 2 AlN {1012}&lt;1210&gt;, regardless of choice of substrate orientation during deposition. They furthermore reveal "pseudo-twinning" of the Ti 2 AlN thin films along MgO&lt;110&gt;, leading to a threefold grain orientation as also seen in cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>A constant bias voltage of -30 V was applied for all depositions. The base pressure at the deposition temperature of 690 °C was ~8 x 10 -5 Pa. For the fcc Ti 1-x Al x N seed layer an Ar/N 2 flux of 13.8/6.9 sccm was chosen leading to a working pressure of 0.35 Pa. The Ti and Al magnetron powers were 60 W and 20 W, respectively, leading to a composition of Ti 0.63 Al 0.37 N as near as possible to the nominal corresponding MAX ratio. In order to achieve stable growth conditions for the Ti 2 AlN MAX phase layer the deposition pressure was increased to 0.8 Pa at an Ar/N 2 flux of 39.7/2.4 sccm. The Ti and Al magnetron powers were 80 W and 26 W, respectively, leading to the Ti/Al ratio of 2/1 as required and calculated from preceding work. The energy of the incident x-rays was monochromatized to 12.917 keV (λ = 0.961 Å). Two different scattering geometries were employed: (1) low angle specular reflectivity either at a fixed incidence angle to determine the growth mode or scanned for the determination of the thickness; (2) large angle x-ray diffraction (XRD) in Bragg-Brentano geometry in order to determine the off-plane lattice parameter. (Pole figures were measured at a laboratory source with CuK α radiation. The final film composition was derived from Rutherford back-scattering (RBS). Cross sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out using a CM300 microscope at 300 keV.)  100 nm Ti Al N 0.63 0.37 Ti AlN 2 MgO 10 nm (a) (b) (c) MgO FIG. 3: Cross sectional TEM micrograph of Ti 2 AlN grown on MgO(111) along the [112] zone axis.

The oscilatory behaviour for the deposited seed layers as well as the films on top are a fingerprint of layer-by-layer growth.
