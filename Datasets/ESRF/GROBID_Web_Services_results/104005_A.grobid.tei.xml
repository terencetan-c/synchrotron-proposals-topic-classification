CryoEM data were acquired through Glacios; specifics are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Image processing was performed in the Biochemistry and Structural Biology Unit (BSU) at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO -Milan) with CryoSPARC v4.2.1. All movie frames were gain corrected during data processing with a gain reference file acquired in the same microscope session. Micrographs showing non vitreous ice, thick ice, high anisotropy or heavy contamination were discarded. In total 2276 images were processed. Initial picking was performed using a blob picker with a</p><p>Table 1 Microscope: Glacios @200kV Data collection software: serialEM camera type: Gatan K2 acquisition mode: counting compression: TIFF LZW gain normalized: no pixel size 0.902 Ang/pixel exposure time 4.4 s total dose per movie 41 electron/Ang 2 number of frames per movie 40</p><p>defocus spread -1.0 to -2.3 um in minimum and maximum particle diameter respectively of 40 Å and 120 Å. An NCC score of 0.3 and power score between 5 and 566 were initially applied, resulting in almost 5 million particles that were extracted with a box size of 200x200 pixels and subjected to several rounds of 2D classification for template generation. In all the 2D classification jobs, the number of online-EM iteration was set to 40, the batchsize per class was increased to 400 and a circular mask diameter was set to 120 Å. The templates were used for template-based picking using a particle diameter of 100 Å yielding a total of 4 million particles that were subjected to iterative 2D classification (using the same parameters described above) that resulted in 246'842 particles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>The selected particles clearly showing protein features, were used for ab-initio 3D reconstruction using 5 classes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The first and the last out of five 3D classes gave shapes of three lobes radiating from a central region, compatible with the shape of the HECT domain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). However, the first class presented an additional density if compared to the HECT suggesting the presence of additional domains. This class was selected for further heterogeneous and non-uniform refinement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). The refinement process produced a final 9.4Å resolution density map (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) where the structure of T-inverted HECT domain (PDB: 4BBN) was initially rigid body fitted. After fitting the HECT domain, the extra density adjacent to it matched the size of either the C2 or WW domains. For simplicity, and based on previously published NMR data (PMID: 25438670), the C2 domain (PDB: 3B7Y) was fitted into the density to generate a preliminary model of NEDD4 in its auto-inhibited form (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Prompted by this preliminary observation, we carried out high-resolution data collection under a Titan Krios microscope with the aim of getting the high-resolution structure of the NEDD4 in its auto-inhibited state. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Krios Dataset</head><p>Multi-grid data collection was performed first on the sample diluted in Dilution buffer to 0.4mg/ml sample (grid type Quantifoil Au-C 300 mesh 1.2/1.3, blot force 0 and blot time 2sec) and a second one on the 0.6mg/ml sample (grid type Quantifoil Au-C 300 mesh 1.2/1.3, blot force 4 and blot time 5sec). Parameters of acquired images are listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>A total of 25'174 micrographs were collected, of which 24'627 were accepted and used for analysis. The particles extracted from these two data sets were combined. All analysis was performed using CryoSPARC v4.2.1 including motion correction and CTF estimation.</p><p>Template picking using a template generated from the Glacios dataset allowed the selection of 19 million particles which were extracted and processed as previously described. Iterative 2D classification resulted in 3.5 million particles which were used to generate 3 classes of ab-inition reconstruction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Two of them were compatible with the HECT shape, with one of the two (34.7% of the particles) showing a more compact shape with additional protruding density (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). The particles from this class were further subjected to iterative heterogeneous refinement, global and local CTF correction, and non-uniform refinement resulting in a map with an estimated resolution of approximately 3.8 Å based on the Fourier shell correlation plot (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2</head><p>Microscope: Krios The high-resolution map was used for model building by rigid body fitting the existing structure of the HECT domain. Using the isolated C-lobe and N-lobe of the HECT crystal structure (PDB: 2XBF), we could unambiguously fit the HECT domain in a compact and closed conformation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). An additional weaker density was present at N-terminus of the HECT domain but definitively assigning a unique secondary structure proved challenging. The relatively low affinity and flexibility between interacting domains or the adoption of different conformations may have hindered their unambiguous assignment onto the HECT domain density.</p><p>Interestingly, while intrinsic flexibility exists between the HECT N-and C-lobes, cryo-EM analysis revealed both lobes, indicating constrained flexibility and the presence of a major conformational state distinct from the crystal structure of the isolated HECT domain (PDB: 2XBF). Currently, local refinement and 3D classification using focused mask on the extra density region are ongoing. This effort aims to accurately trace the residues within this particular area.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
