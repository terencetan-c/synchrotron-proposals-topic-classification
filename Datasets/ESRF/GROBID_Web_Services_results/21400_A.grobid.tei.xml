<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This beam time was a continuation of our proposal HS-1488: "High-pressure phonon spectroscopy of Fe-Ni alloys". In that previous beam time we have studied the classical Invar system Fe 65 Ni 35 , at 300 K and pressures up to 10.4 GPa as well as at ambient pressure and temperatures between 5 K and 300 K (see experimental report HS-1488). We did observe only subtle temperature effects on the phonon density-ofstates (DOS), reflecting the special Invar property, namely the anomalous small thermal expansion of Fe 65 Ni 35 . The application of pressure, however, lead to strong and characteristic changes in the phonon-DOS, in particular a strong increase of the low-energy modes to higher energies and only minor changes of the high-energy modes (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Even between 7.1 and 10.4 GPa, the highest pressures, a non-proportional increase of the low-and high-energy modes was observed, pointing to remains of the Invar properties. Since an inelastic IXS study [1]  has reported that the Fe moment vanishes around 12 GPa, and since the Invar properties are inherently connected with the Fe magnetism, we continued our studies to higher pressures, here 12.9 and 17.3 GPa, where we expected to observe a "normal" Debye behaviour, here an about proportional variation of low-energy and high-energy modes in the phonon-DOS. The same sample (15 µm thick, 95% enriched in Fe-57), resting half a year in the diamond-anvil cell at 10.4 GPa, was used. The experimental conditions were similar to the previous study, the monochromatized beam had the same width of 3.5 meV. Again we used the two techniques connected with nuclear scattering of synchrotron radiation, the local phonon-DOS was obtained from nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) and the magnetic properties and absorber thickness (proportional to f LM , the Mössbauer-Lamb factor) were measured with (elastic) nuclear forward scattering (NFS).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows on the left panel the phonon DOS extracted from NIS spectra of Fe 65 Ni 35 measured at various pressures and temperatures in both beam-times. Details of the evaluation of the DOS and the derived elastic and thermodynamic properties, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, are described in Ref. 2. Comparison of the phonon-DOS at 10.4 and 17.3 GPa reveal now a proportional variation of the low-and high-energy region of the phonon-DOS as expected for the suppression of the Invar properties. This is also clearly reflected by a kink around 12 GPa in the derived parameters shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. These results have just been submitted for publication <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The NFS spectra shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> were measured with decreasing pressure starting from 16 GPa. The sharp Bessel beats arise from the effective sample thickness, which is proportional to f LM . At 5 GPa, these Bessel beat structures start to broaden, and already at 4 GPa magnetic interaction have completely changed the spectral features, demonstrating that the onset or suppression of magnetic order can be sensitively monitored by NFS spectra.</p><p>[1] J.P. <ref type="bibr">Rueff et al., PRB 63, 132409 (2001)</ref>.</p><p>[2] H.
