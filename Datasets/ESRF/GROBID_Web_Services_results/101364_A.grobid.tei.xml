<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>BX90 diamond anvil cell with 250 μm culet was prepared. A piece of gadolinium was loaded along with molecular nitrogen, acting as a reagent as well as a pressure-transmitting medium. The sample was compressed to 50 GPa and laser-heated to temperatures above 2000 K at our home laboratory in Bayreuth. After laser-hating the pressure increased to 52 GPa.</p><p>The X-ray diffraction mapping of the heated sample revealed the formation of a novel phase since diffraction lines not belonging to any known phases (i.e. gadolinium, cubic GdN, or nitrogen) were detected. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was collected on the positions with the highestquality diffraction spots. The structure of the novel gadolinium-nitrogen compound was fully determined onsite. The solid has the Gd5N14 stoichiometry and comprises nitrogen dimers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> inset). The Gd5N14 compound is isostructural to Y5N14, synthesized by our group under similar conditions (49 GPa and 2000 K). To determine the equation of state and existence pressure of Gd5N14, its decompression in several steps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) down to 1 bar was done. The single-crystal diffraction spots of Gd5N14 were traced down to 9 GPa, and at 1 bar its diffraction lines could no longer be observed indicating the decomposition of Gd5N14. Fitting of the Gd5N14 experimental pressure-volume datapoints with the 2 nd order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state gives the bulk modulus K0=129(12) GPa.</p><p>The formation of Gd5N14 compound isostructural to Y5N14 under similar conditions was expected since both metals possess only +3 oxidation state and the ionic radius of gadolinium ion r(Gd 3+ ) = 1.078 Å is close to yttrium ionic radius r(Y 3+ ) = 1.04 Å. These results demonstrate that M5N14 structure type is common for highpressure rare-earth nitrides and the crystallization in this structure type can be expected for nitrides of M = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er (with r(M 3+ ) = 1.03-1.06 Å ionic radii) and perhaps for an even greater number of lanthanides.</p><p>The obtained data should result in one scientific publication. This result provides prerequisites for further studying of the Gd-N system at the megabar regime, since the formation of unique polynitrides isostructural to recently discovered Y2N11 and YN6 with polynitrogen double-helix and N18 macrocycles, can be expected. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure. 1.
