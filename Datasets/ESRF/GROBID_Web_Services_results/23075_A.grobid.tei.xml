<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>High temperature X-ray powder diffraction experiments were carried out in the SNBL High Resolution Powder Beamline BM1B in the following compounds: K 2 MoO 4 , K 2 Mo 0.5 W 0.5 O 4 and K 2 WO 4 . We used radiation with λ=0.5 Å. The sealed high temperature oven with quartz window was mounted in the beamline and its temperature controller was tested. It was possible to achieve and to stabilize all the temperatures required for the experiments but in general we observed a systematically overshooting during the heating in the total investigated temperature range (300 K ≤ T ≤ 930 K). In order to minimize the overshooting and to achieve the set point temperature as fast as possible, P.I.D. parameters have been optimized for different temperature set points (see the oven book note for more details). Capillaries of 0.4mm of diameter were filled with a dry powder of each compound just before the beginning of the experiment. The capillaries were not sealed allowing the water exchange between the samples and the oven environment during the data collection. Different kinds of scanning were done in each sample (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) in two series of heating-cooling cycles (RT → 800 K→373 K → 800 K → RT After the first series of measurements we observe an abnormally high background at the low angles. The overall data background was considerably reduced by placing an additional peace of WC close to the oven window forming a kind of low angle beam stop. At the very end a diffraction pattern of the empty oven was also taken. The "experimental" background (empty oven + WC peaks) was fitted using a polynomial function and subtract from each diffraction pattern.</p><p>Scanning range ( o ) Speed ( o ) Counting time (s) 1 6.4 ≤ 2θ ≤ 10.2 12.9 ≤ 2θ ≤ 16.2 0.04 1 2 3.0 ≤ 2θ ≤ 30 0.004 1 3 3.0 ≤ 2θ ≤ 13 13 ≤ 2θ ≤ 23 23 ≤ 2θ ≤ 30 0.003 1 2 4 Table 1: Different kinds of scanning performed during the investigations of the K 2 Mo x W (1-x) O 4 (0&lt; x &lt;1) structures in the High Resolution Powder Beamline BM1B.</p><p>For the investigated compounds the presence, intensity and shape of diffraction peaks were used to determine the phase evolution with temperature. In the mixed K 2 Mo 0.5 W 0.5 O 4 compound additional scans around 8.8 o ≤ 2θ ≤ 9.2 o with speed of 0.002 o /s were done in the last cooling cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The compounds K 2 MoO 4 and K 2 WO 4 are isomorphic with monoclinic symmetry C2/m (Z=4) at room temperature <ref type="bibr">(Gatehouse &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Leverett, 1969 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Koster et al., 1969)</ref> and hexagonal symmetry P6 3 /mmc (Z=2) at high temperature (van den <ref type="bibr">Akker et al., 1970)</ref>.</p><p>Previous results report the existence of a modulated orthorhombic intermediary phase in both compounds. In this phase the modulation vector q lies in the basal plane of the high temperature hexagonal symmetry. The modulated phase is incommensurate with 0.29 &lt; q &lt; 0.30 between 593 K and 733 K for K 2 MoO 4 and commensurate with q = 1/4 from 643 K up to 733 K for K 2 WO 4 <ref type="bibr">(Tuinstra &amp; van den Berg, 1983)</ref> with subsequent ones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Two phase transition temperatures could unambiguously be determined.</p><p>The higher phase transition temperature T I is independent of the crystal composition and the lower temperature T II decreases with increasing x; the obtained values of T I and T II for the pure compounds (x = 0 and 1) are in agreement with those found in literature. The first transition at temperature T II seems to be related to H 2 O loss. The existence of both the hydrated and the anhydrous forms of the crystal is evidenced in the X-ray powder diffraction results when comparing the diffraction pattern obtained in successive heating-  cooling cycles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Semi-empirical crystal structure analysis of the K 2 MoO 4 , K 2 WO 4 and K 2 Mo 0.5 W 0.5 O 4 has shown that the anhydrous phase diffraction data can be fitted using a presumable orthorhombic unit cell, twice as big (Z=8) as the original hydrated one. Attempts to refine a model for the crystal structure in this phase are in progress. In the presumable modulated phase, the strongest satellites are of 2 nd order. The * in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> indicates the most important ones. As can be seen, the intensity of the satellite reflections increases with decreasing temperature. Data have been fit to Cmcm (0 q 0) symmetry but no model for the structure can be proposed yet. Further investigations are in progress; it is intended to check the possibility for the anhydrous form to be a superstructure with q equal to 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Despite the initial problems with operation of high temperature oven a good data set could be obtained. The experiments with mixed K 2 Mo x W (1-x) O 4 compounds using SNBL High Resolution Powder Beamline confirmed previous results and clearly evidenced the existence of the satellite reflections in the high temperature phase and that the room temperature phase is dependent of the thermal history of the sample.</p><p>The data is currently been analysed in order to determine new models for the crystal structure in the modulated phase.</p></div>
