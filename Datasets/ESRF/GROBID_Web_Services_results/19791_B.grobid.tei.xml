<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The current experiment is the continuation and development of CH-912 and SC-630 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We aim to study the growth and structure of surfactant-templated films formed at the air/solution interface using both specular and off-specular reflectivity. Specular measurements are highly sensitive to the electron density of the film normal to the interface, and the roughness of the surface so allow us to examine the properties of the formed film. Off-specular patterns can be taken every 60 seconds (using a position sensitive detector) throughout the induction and film formation process, hence the evolution of the diffraction peaks, corresponding to the ordered mesophase within the films, can be monitored as a function of time. In this study we have been particularly interested in the effects of changing the silica precursor concentration on the structure and surface texture of the film and the effect of an insoluble monolayer at the solution surface.</p><p>The films were grown at room temperature at the air/solution interface at the surface of a raised meniscus in a Teflon trough with a surface area of ca 63cm 2 . The films were grown from an acidic subphase (0.2M HCl) using tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) as the silica source and cetytrimthylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the surfactant template. The molar ratios were 1 water : 3.63x10 -3 HCl : 1.52x10 -3 CTAB, and the TMOS varied between 0.005 and 0.019. Film formation occurs after an induction period of 200 to 300 mins depending on TMOS concentration. Insoluble monolayers of perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane and PS-PEO diblock copolymer were spread at the solution interface, to act as secondary templates.</p><p>Typical specular and off specular measurements are shown in Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref> for 1 water : 3.63x10 -3 HCl : 1.52x10 -3 CTAB, 0.016 TMOS. The specular reflectivity exhibits Fresnel decay which is modified by a broad fringe due to the surface film. Superimposed on this profile are three diffraction peaks which correspond to a repeat distance of ca 40Å; this is consistent with the size of cylindrical CTAB micelles (~35Å) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Analysis of this data, for films grown with and without secondary templates, is in progress using standard Parratt fitting procedures.</p><p>0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 1E-7 1E-6 1E-5 1E-4 1E-3 0.01 0.1 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R(Q) Q / Å -1 1.E+00 1.E+01 1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04</formula><p>1.E+05 0.07 0.12 0.17 0.22 0.27</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q / Å -1</formula><p>Intensity Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> The specular reflectivity from 1 water : 3.63x10 -3 HCl : 1.52x10 -3 CTAB : 0.016 TMOS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>The off specular reflectivity recorded 188 mins (thin line), 288 mins (dashed line) and 368 mins (bold line) after spreading The central peak (0.17Å -1 ) in the off-specular reflectivity profile (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) corresponds to the specular reflectivity peak; its position is seen to move slowly with time, due to evaporation of the solution. The specular peak is flanked by the 1 st order diffraction peak (0.13Å -1 ) and the 2 nd order diffraction peak (0.24Å -1 ). The peak situated at 0.1Å -1 is the Yoneda wing which probes the changing surface roughness with time. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows how these peaks evolve with time. The intensity of the specular peak decreases, while the first and second order peaks only become significant when the film begins to form (&gt;270 mins). Surprisingly, the intensity of the 1 st order peak reaches a maximum and then begins to decrease. This can be seen clearly in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (the open diamonds), which also shows for the first time that the growth mechanism of the film is concentration-dependent. At the lowest silica precursor concentration, the 1 st order diffraction peak is found to grow in slowly, and remain at its maximum intensity indefinitely. As the silica concentration is increased, the maximum peak intensity increases; however almost as soon as it reaches its maximum intensity the peak starts to decay. Similar trends are seen in the 2 nd order diffraction peak. We are currently modelling this data assuming the growing film can be approximated to a layer of particles, having alternating silica and surfactant layers, which appear at the surface during the film formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Karen J.
