The expected results were the structural evolution of the PVDF-TrFE phases a a function of thermal annealing and electrical poling. More precisely, as the direct α-β transformation requires high energy, the transition may proceed through an intermediate phase. One prototypical route from α to β consists in transforming the α phase to the polar  one and then to the β one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</head><p>The -β transition of the PVDF-TrFE on a flexible substrate was studied during heating/cooling and after electrical poling by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) on BM32 at ESRF. Without any electrical poling, the  phase appears in PVDF-TrFE films at the transition from α to β during cooling after first and second heating. On the contrary, after short electrical pulses of  70 MV.m -1 , the  phase can appear during heating at the transition from β to α (cf. Figure). Hence, the δ phase has been put in evidence starting from a ferroelectric β phase during heating after short pulses of relatively low electric field. In addition, we put in evidence that the coefficient of thermal expansion of PVDF-TrFE depends on the phase. After poling, a negative in-plane stress has been put in evidence for the  phase. In general, heating could be used to significantly decrease poling field values. The advantages of  over β are the higher Curie temperature and the larger crystallite height by a factor of three to four. Moreover, permittivity and ferroelectric measurements are currently being done at the CEA/LITEN in order to correlate the structure with the properties as a function of electrical poling and temperature.</p><p>-Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.): The beam time of 9 shifts was used to study the PVDF-TrFE film as a function of temperature during annealing up to 160°C and cooling to room temperature. This experiment was repeated once. Indeed, PVDF-TrFE behaves differently during the first or second experiment. Then, a PVDF-TrFE-based capacitor was studied as a function of electrical poling and temperature.
