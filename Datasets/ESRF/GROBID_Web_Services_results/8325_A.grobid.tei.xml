<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this experiment was to continue measurements on crystals of a number of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/substrate complexes in particular the prolyl-and histidyl-tRNA synthetases.</p><p>(1) T. thermophilus prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRSTT). As described in an accompanying report the crystal structure of ProRSTT, a class IIa aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, was determined to 2.43A resolution using data measured on BM14. In addition the ProRSTT-proline complex structure was determined using data to 2.91$ resolution measured on the Swiss-Norwegian beamline and shows how substrate binding induces very significant conformational changes. We have also crystallised the complex with cognate tRNAP" which offers the possibility to observe how the class IIa C-terminal RNA binding domain interacts with the tRNA anti-codon stem-loop.</p><p>A tetragonal crystal form was obtained with either tRNAPro(GGG) or tRNAPro(GGC). The bipyramidal crystals grow to a maximum size of 400x400x400 l.trn3 and of are space-group P432,2 (#96). The crystals diffract to a maximum resolution of 3.1A when exposed to the most intense undulator radiation on ID2 but even when frozen to l00K, using 28% glycerol as cryo-protectant, there is rapid radiation damage. A complete data set has been collected to 3.5A resolution with tRNAP"(GGC) and to 3.6A resolution tRNAPro(GGG). Details of the data collections on ID2 are given below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The tRNA complex structure was solved by molecular replacement (programme AMORE) using the refined model of the ProRSTT dimer a search model and the resolution range 4.5-9A. The correct solution was the 15th highest peak in the rotation search (correlation = 0.11) but highest in the translation search (correlation=O.338 in space-group P4,2,2), the second highest translation solution being in the wrong space-group, P4,2,2 (correlation=0.211).</p><p>The tRNA complex structure had to be refined carefully because of the limited resolution (3.5A), the free R-factor being an indispensable guide. The molecular replacement solution for the protein dimer was firstly improved by rigid-body refinement of domains. The free-correlation rose from 0.55 to 0.66 due to significant re-orientations of the anti-codon binding domains. A map then showed clear difference density for a single tRNA molecule bound to the synthetase dimer, there being no room in the crystal for a second tRNA. A model was built in stages for most of the tRNA except the acceptor stem (for which density is absent) making use of fragments of tRNAph' and tRNAasP. The density was good enough to discriminate Py:P from P:Py base-pairs in the anticodon stem, assignments which were confirmed when the sequences of the T. thermophilus tRNAp" isoacceptors became known. Refinement was continued by a combination of manual adjustment and positional refinement while maintaining as far as possible tight non-crystallographic and geometrical restraints. The current R-free (R-factor) is 0.364 (0.344).</p><p>Despite the modest resolution, the mode of binding of the anti-codon stem-loop to the class IIa anti-codon binding domain is clear, the main interacting surface being the P-sheet and an a-helix which aproaches the anti-codon loop from the major groove side. The distortion introduced into the anti-codon loop is reminiscent of that occuring upon cognate tRNA binding to class IIb synthetases, with bases G-35, G-36 and G-37 splayed out, but differs in that base C-34 remains stacked under base U-33 and bases U-32 and A-38 form a base-pair. In common with the class IIa synthetases GlyRS and ThrRS, ProRS has to recognise cognate tRNAs in which the second and third anti-codon nucleotides uniquely define the amino acid, whereas the first (wobble) base is variable (i.e. NGG for tRNAp'" isoacceptors, NCC for tRNAgly and NGU for tRNA*?. The structure explains how this functional requirement is met by clearly showing specific recognition of bases G-35 and G-36 by side-chains from the synthetase, whereas base C-34 makes no interactions and is stacked under base U-33 in a pocket which could accommodate any nucleotide. More precise details of the interaction of tRNAp'" with ProRS awaits a higher resolution structure of the complex.</p></div>		</body>
