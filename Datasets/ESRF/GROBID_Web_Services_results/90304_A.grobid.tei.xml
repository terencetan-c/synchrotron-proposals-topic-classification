<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the performed experiment was to find a magnetovolume effect (MVE) in pure 4d and 5d metals, predicted by theory (see details in the priopsal) but not proved experimentally, so far. Because threeaxial tensile strains are difficult to be realized, we assumed that heavy (at the level of 10 16 ions/cm 2 ) and uniform in volume Yb ion irradiation of Nb and Ta films would destroy the lattice in the manner that partially resembles a strained lattice. Initial XRD measurements showed an expansion of crystal lattice after irradiation (results not shown in the report). Also SQUID measurements have shown a well-developed magnetic hysteresis loop in the irradiated samples, as expected for MVE (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in the proposal). The assumed magnetic moment per atom material of the film was expected to reach a level of 5e-3 μB. Because SQUID probes a total moment of the sample, we used an element-sensitive x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) technique to check where the detected magnetic moment is located. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Complete XMCD measurements were carried out for Nb films. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows XANES and XMCD and XMCD spectra recorded at Nb L3,2 edge. Both spectra for irradiated (B) and non-irradiated (C) samples suggest a low value for ml and ms , close to the sensitivity level of this technique. Because of a lack of any difference between these two spectra, we cannot conclude that magnetic moment is located at Nb atoms in the irradiated film. Similar results were obtained for Ta films (not shown in this report). A dependence of XMCD signal vs applied magnetic field (XMCD (H)), measured in the next step, reflected magnetization reversal of a specified element, similarly as a standard magnetic hysteresis loop recoded by magnetometry techniques. This dependence, registered for the samples B and C of Nb films at L3 edge, shows similar flat negative slopes suggesting their diamagnetic behaviour (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). On the contrary, the same dependence acquired for the Yb L3 edge in Ta irradiated film displays a substantial positive slope (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).  In conclusion, Yb ion irradiation with a fluence of 10 16 ions/cm 2 of 4d (Nb) and 5d (Ta) metals does not induce at their atoms a magnetic moment (due crystal lattice deformation) as expected for MVE. Instead, detected magnetic moments are located most probably at the implanted Yb atoms, with a concentration of 2% in the irradiated sample. If it is located only there, a mean value should reach a value of 0.2 μB per atom. It is difficult to judge unequivocally whether ordering adopts the ferromagnetic or spin-glass character. Most probably, due to low concentration, it is the latter case with freezing temperature higher than that for SQUID measurements (15K) showing evident magnetic hysteresis loop in Yb-irradiated films.</p></div>			</div>
