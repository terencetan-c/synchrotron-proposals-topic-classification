<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A system to allow in-situ GISAXS during slot-die coating (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) of waterborne coatings was successfully tested during this beamtime at BM26B. The great performances of the beamline allowed high quality data to be acquired with second time resolutions. Î‘utomated slot die coating apparatus (DUBBLE BM26B, ESRF, Grenoble &amp; MINA, RUG) S X-rays Figure 2. (left) GISAXS patterns at selected time for the hard (top row) and the soft (bottom row) investigated polyacrylic coatings. (right) Time evolution of the scattered intensity for the two studied coatings as revealed by in-situ GISAXS. Drastic intensity rise is related to formation of a "well defined" solid/air interface.</p><p>Three different formulations were investigated, named here H, S and HS. The beamtime went smooth and we had no problems with the performances of the beamline and the quality of the beam. The support of the beamline scientist was great. Our results are unexpected and clearly show the presence of a shear banding behaviour, especially for the hard colloidal coating. This is unexpected as generally the scientific community neglects shear behaviour during the slot-die and bar coating processing. Moreover, the structural evolutions is over within 10-15 min, while 30 minutes are necessary for macroscopic drying of the films according to weight changes with time. We are currently finalizing the data analysis and we plan to write a manuscript with these high quality results. Moreover, the success of these experiments and the previous 26-02-875 beamtime, have led to a successful new PhD project started on 1 st December 2019 that will last for 4 years and will continue this investigation mostly at the ESRF and making use of the new capabilities of BM26 after the EBS upgrade. t drying = 20 min t drying = 12 min t drying = 4 min R t drying = 0 min R R R q z q y t drying = 20 min t drying = 12 min t drying = 4 min t drying = 0 min q z q y R Onset of "crust" formation 0 5 10 15 20 25 0.0 1.0x10 -4 2.0x10 -4 3.0x10 -4 (Direct Beam) (Refracted) (Specular) (Specular) &lt;average pixel intensity&gt; (a.u.) t drying (min) "before crust formation" HS 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1x10 -5 2x10 -5 3x10 -5 4x10 -5 (Direct Beam) (Refracted) (Specular) &lt;average pixel intensity&gt; (a.u.) t drying (min) "before crust formation" S</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
