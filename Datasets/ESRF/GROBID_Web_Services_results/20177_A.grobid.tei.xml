<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment number: LS1941</head><p>Beamline: The genus Clostridium, traditionally defined as containing gram-positive, anaerobic, spore forming non-motile rod-shaped bacteria, constitutes a phylogenetically incoherent genus and are widespread in the environment. They participate to the degradation of organic compounds. Some of them, such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium absonum etc. produce potent toxins and are pathogenic to human and animals. They are mostly associated with two types pathology according to the mode of acquisition, gastrointestinal diseases and gangrene. These toxins are also implicated in the pathogenesis of several other diseases in humans and other animals.</p><p>As an on going research programme we are studying the structure and function of alpha-toxin from different clostridial specieces. Over the years we have determined several structures of this protein from three different bacterial strains (NCTC-8237, CER89L43 and a divergent strain isolated from a swan). The C. perfringens α-toxin is a zinc metallophospholipase C and the 3D-structure is composed of two domains, the catalytic N-terminal domain is α-helical and carries the site for phospholipid hydrolysis, while the C-terminal doamin is an 8-stranded βsandwich and has been implicated in membrane binding. A flexible linker connects these two domains. The overall fold of this enzyme is very similar in the different crystal forms, though the hinge angle between the domains varies by 4-6º among the various structures. However, the conformational variability in two different loops resulted in an active site accessible to substrates in one form, called 'the open form' and an active site obscured by a helix and in therefore not accessible to the substrate in the other called 'the closed form'.</p><p>Recently the production of phospholipase C by C. absonum has been reported and we cloned, expressed and purified this enzyme from E. coli to homogeniety. We were also successful to produce diffraction quality crystals in two different crystal forms.</p><p>During this allocation period we have collected a 2.5Å data-set, from a crystal of form-I. The symmetry of the crystals are orthorhombic with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure determination is now in progress. </p></div>			</div>
