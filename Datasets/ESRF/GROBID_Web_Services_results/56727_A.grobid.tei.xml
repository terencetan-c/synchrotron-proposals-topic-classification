<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Several datasets of single crystals of murine norovirus (MNV) 2007 and CR10 P domains were collected. Diffraction was around 2.8-3Å. Processing of these datasets was succesful but no solution was found during Molecular replacement, even though several different spacegroups were tested.</p><p>Datasets for the P domains of the murine norovirus (MNV) variants 2007 and CR10 cocrystallized with B trisachharide, A trisaccharide or sialic acid were collected. The single crystals diffracted up to 3 Å. Processing with xds was succesful. Molecular weight analysis, however, indicated that 10 monomers should be present in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was only succesful with 4 monomers. The solution didn't inidcate the presence of additional electron density for a bound ligand.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Human norovirus P domains from genogroups GII.19 and GII.21 were tested, unbound and co-crystallized with HBGAs. More than 20 datasets were collected and crystals diffracted to better than 2 Å. Previous results indicated that GII.19 couldn't bind HBGAs due to steric hindrance with the neighbouring unit cell. In a novel attempt we incubated GII.19 P domain with HBGAs prior to crystallization screening. Indeed, the P domain-HBGA mix crystallized under novel conditions. Analysis of the data however showed, that crystal packing was comparable for all conditions and HBGAs could not bind due to steric hindrance. However, co-crystallization with only the monosaccharide fucose was succesful. Fucose bound to the top of the P domain at a dimeric interface. These results suggested that GII.19 is able to bind HBGAs similar to other NoV variants.</p><p>Data collected for GII.21 Pdomain-HBGA complexes are currently under investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Calicivirus The prototype genogroup II (GII) norovirus strain, termed Hawai virus (HV) was found not to interact with carbohydrate attachment factors. The reason for that is unknown. In an attempt to restore the binding capability of the HV P domain, we mutated two loops that are close to the carbohydrate binding interface. Crystals of these mutated P domain diffracted to ~1.8 Å.</p><p>Comparison with the wild-type P domain showed that residues that are possibly involved in ligand interaction, reorientated towards the carbohydrate binding interface.</p><p>In addition, we tried to co-crystallize the mutated P domain with carbohydrates. No additional electron denisty was found for bound ligands, from the datasets analyzed so far.</p></div>			</div>
