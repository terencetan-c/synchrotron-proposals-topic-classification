Indeed, we were able to record XAS spectra on both our samples of As doped HgCdTe. This was a kind of challenge for this beamline because of the low As concentration of 10 19 cm -3 , that is a concentration of 3.10 -4 . To be successful, we had to open as much as possible beamline slits and to bring as close as possible the 13-element energy-resolved detector. Working so, we got some Bragg diffraction peaks from the ZnCdTe substrate impinging inside the detector. As is illustrated in figure 1 (first curve), these Bragg peaks produce artefacts rendering the recorded XAS spectra completely useless (refer to vertical bars). Therefore, we put the sample on a slowly rotating spinner and Bragg peak were successfully washed out as illustrated on figure 1 (second curve). Given the low As concentration, acquisition time for spectra were relatively important of the order of 3 shifts (24H) per sample: the stability of BM29 was indeed an asset for us. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the effect of the Hg-rich annealing on sample 24875 while figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the effect on extracted EXAFS oscillations. A complete data analysis (that will not be developed here) was conducted on data and showed that the commonly admitted scenario of an As migration from a Hg site to a Te site does not take place in our case. This analysis is the object of a communication at the 2008 US Workshop On The Physics And Chemistry Of II-VI Materials and a publication has been written which suggest another scenario. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: necessity of the spinner to record meaningful XAS spectra.
