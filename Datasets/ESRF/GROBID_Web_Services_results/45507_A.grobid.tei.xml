<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Please note: Because of experimental difficulties with the new UHV sample manipulator at ID32 the initial beamtime allocation for SI-2168SI-  (20.1. -1.2.2011) )  could not be used by our collaboration. As a result of that and the imminent closure of ID32 in 2012 the proposed study on non-dipole corrections in XSW measurement was not pursued. In agreement with the beamline scientist, the re-scheduled beamtime SI-2168SI-   (19.-25.10.2011)), i.e. our last beamtime at ID32, was used to complement earlier XSW measurements of organic molecules on single crystal surfaces.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The adsorption of Pyrenetetraone (PyT) on Ag(111), which we studied before using the XSW technique <ref type="bibr">(SI-2002)</ref>, results in surprisingly small bonding distances d 0 and a significant distortion of the molecule. We chose this system to study whether chemical substitution changes the adsorption geometry and/or the interaction strength between the molecule and the substrate. NO 2 -derivatives of PyT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), synthesized within the group of K. Müllen (MPI Mainz), were deposited on Ag(111) to measure the influence of the two functional groups attached to the PyT molecule.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">XPS analysis of NO 2 -PyT on Ag(111): C1s and O1s</head><p>Controlled by a quartz microbalance we prepared films with increasing coverage of NO 2 -PyT on a clean Ag(111) substrate, i.e. from a submonolayer to one monolayer. We acquired several high quality XSW measurements using the C1s and O1s core-levels. It turned out that the N1s XPS signal was too weak to perform XSW measurements because of a high substrate background at the binding energy of the N1s peak. In the O1s signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, right) two different peaks could be resolved that can be assigned to the two different chemical surroundings of the oxygen atoms: The peak at lower binding energies (529.0 eV) corresponds to the four oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group, while the peak at higher binding energy (531.3 eV) is related to the four oxygen atoms of the nitryl group. By fitting two Gaussian peaks to the XPS signal of oxygen we could evaluate the intensity variation of the two oxygen species for the subsequent XSW analysis. The carbon XPS signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, left) is composed of at least four individual peaks corresponding to C-H, C=O, C-N, and C-C bonds. Since also shake-up peaks may contribute to the spectrum, we do not try to fit the relatively complicated C1s signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">XSW measurement of NO 2 -PyT on Ag(111)</head><p>XSW measurements were performed for carbon and oxygen. By fitting each O1s spectrum with the method described above we were able to distinguish the two different oxygen species in the molecule. A preliminary analysis of the XSW scans is shown in  In contrast, for NO 2 -PyT the average carbon bonding distance is significantly larger than for PyT molecules on <ref type="bibr">Ag(111)</ref>. This remarkable behavior may be attributed to the two nitryl groups which -at least their oxygen atoms -are nearly at the same bonding distance as the carbon core of the NO 2 -PyT. (As was mentioned before, we were not able to measure the bonding distance of the nitrogen atom.) Whether the NO 2 -groups directly or indirectly cause a 'repulsion' of the carbon core might be studied via advanced DFT calculations.</p><p>We wish to thank our local contact for the excellent support on ID32.</p></div>
