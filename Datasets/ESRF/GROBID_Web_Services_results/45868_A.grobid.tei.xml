<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>December 13-17, 2010 SAXS patterns were obtained with the detector placed at two different sample-to-detector distances (S2DD) to be able to measure scattering over a wider q-range. Long distance measurements were able to span a q-range of 0.04505 nm -1 to 0.99899 nm -1 ; short distance measurements a q-range of 0.04104 nm -1 to 5.30263 nm -1 .</p><p>The following report describes an attempt to match the SAXS patterns obtained in separate but similar experiments with different sample-to-detector distances.</p><p>Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with M n = 50 kg mol -1 PDI of 2.1 and regioregularity of 99% (OS2100, Plexcore, Plextronics) was mixed with toluene in the required concentration by stirring at high temperature (70C).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background measurement: TOLUENE</head><p>The largest overlap in q-values between two toluene SAXS patterns was obtained between a long distance pattern recorded at 11C (A56) and a short distance pattern of 25C (B01). In this case, the qrange in which overlap could be reached is from approximately 0.25 (0.3) nm -1 up to 1 nm -1 . Overlap is reached by dividing the scattered intensity values at the short distance by a value of 51. This is allowed since the scattering intensities are not absolute. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 to 3</ref> show respectively the overlap of these SAXS patterns, the overlap attempt between B01 and a long distance pattern at 64C (A52) and one between B01 and the average of A52 and A56. In Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the recorded toluene SAXS patterns and their specifications are listed.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Recorded SAXS patterns for toluene with specifications.   Independent of the used toluene results, the overlap between the 2 sets of data (long and short distances) is satisfactory. The difference between long and short distances in the low q-range can be explained as follows: the intensities measured at low q (q &lt; ~0.2 nm -1 ) are at the short S2DD situated very closely to the beam stop and cannot be accurately measured at this short S2DD.</p><p>We expect that temperature dependent series of SAXS patterns for different solution samples can be matched in a similar way. Below, this is illustrated for the following samples: 1%, 2% and 5% P3HT in toluene.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues with temperature:</head><p>The actual temperature of the sample at a certain frame is not monitored accurately in the experiment. In the experiment the sample is cooled by a certain rate from a starting to an ending temperature. It is hoped for that by using the same heating/cooling rates that the temperatures of the different frames will match. However, this is not absolutely certain. The sample temperature per frame was estimated by the temperature profile which was set up during the experiment (as will be indicated below).</p><p>Sample information: 8.3 mg P3HT (OS2100) was mixed with 0.830 g toluene at elevated temperature and while stirring, resulting in effective sample concentration of 1%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1% P3HT in Toluene</head><p>The temperature program followed started at 35C and cooled down to 5C at a rate of 1C/min and consecutive isothermal period at 5C, as is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. In Table <ref type="table">2</ref> the recorded SAXS patterns for the 1% sample are listed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2. List of recorded SAXS series for 1% P3HT in toluene.</head><p>To compare the overall signal evolution in long distance and short distance experiments on the same sample, the invariant of the long distance series and the scattering intensity evolution at q 0.5 nm -1 for short distance will be plotted together. The invariant of the short distance experiments could not be used for this, as can be understood when looking at their representation in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. What causes the shape of this invariant in contrast to the invariant of the long S2DD experiments is not clear. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the overall evolution of the SAXS signal throughout the recorded series on the 1% P3HT sample. For long distance measurements the invariant is shown (black circles) while for short distance the signal evolution at a q-value of 0.5 nm -1 is plotted (red triangles). When matching the frame numbers in both series by the last frame before the (fairly sudden) signal increase, a small offset of approximately 3 frames can be detected. The frame numbers are matched by this 3-frame offset. Four pairs of frames which are chosen are located in different parts of the temperature series, assuring that overlap is investigated for all frames in the experimental series. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows a plot of the 4 frames of each series which are overlapped by shifting the SAXS curves of B09 by dividing through a value of 44. Frames A60_1 and B09_4 are plotted in black, frames A60_30 and B09_33 in red, frames A60_46 and B09_49 in green and frames A60_90 and B09_93 in blue. From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> it can be observed that for all frames acceptable overlap can be found in the q-range of 0.3 nm -1 to 1 nm -1 . The difficulty of finding good overlap is more pronounced in the samples with higher concentrations of P3HT, as will be shown in the following sections. Sample information: 20.7 mg P3HT (OS2100) was mixed with 1.001 g toluene at elevated temperature, resulting in a effective sample concentration of 2.07%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2% P3HT in Toluene</head><p>The temperature program followed started at 35C and cooled down to 5C at a rate of 1C/min and consecutive isothermal period at 5C, as shown above in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table">3</ref> the recorded SAXS patterns for the 2% sample are listed.</p><p>Table 3. List of SAXS series recorded for 2% P3HT in toluene with specificatons. impose an identical temperature profile to the sample in both experiments. Question remains as to what causes this large offset and what the resulting temperatures are of the recorded scattering patterns.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. Plot overlaying the relative signal evolution of long S2DD (black, invariant) and short S2DD (red, scattering intensity at q 0.5 nm -1 ) distance for 2% P3HT in toluene with a 35 frame shift to find reasonable overlap.</p><p>In an attempt to find overlap with a single shift factor for these series, frames of both series are matched according to the 35 frame offset described above, resulting in pair wise comparison as listed in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The shift factor was chosen such that the overlap is maximal for the first pair (A61_5 and B08_40) and results in a division by 39. The curves are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>.  When looking only at the first set, frames A61_5 and B08_40, for which overlap is optimized, a q-range similar as the one in the toluene sample and the 1% sample can be matched by shifting. This is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> for q approximately 0.3 nm -1 to 1 nm -1 . This range is rapidly decreasing when moving to frames positioned further in the temperature series. It can be noticed however that when looking at both series individually, the evolution of the signal is very comparable between the two experiments, as was expected from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. In the case of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>, a single shift factor was used for the complete series. In Figures 11 to 15 on the other hand, a different shift factor is used to match each pair individually as well as possible. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref> shows the overlay of these plots.     Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>. SAXS patterns of A61 frame 60 and B08 frame 95, with B08 shifted by diving through 35. There is no range within the available q-range, where significant overlap could be reached.</p><p>For the series of 2% P3HT in toluene, finding good overlap seems more problematic than for the 1% P3HT sample. Not only is it impossible to find overlap with a single shift factor per series over the complete q-range determined for toluene, it is also not possible to find overlap with any shift factor of choice for each pair of SAXS patterns individually. SAXS patterns in the start of the temperature series can still be matched. For the SAXS patterns at lower temperatures matching becomes impossible, as was shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>. This is due to the fact that the slopes of both SAXS patterns of a pair are not the same. The reason for this however is not clear and it was expected that both patterns would be able to simply overlap after shifting. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref> shows all 5 pairs in one overlay plot. </p></div>

Shift factors were optimized for individual pairs and the best possible overlapped results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">19</ref>. Also here it can be clearly seen that the overlap region decreases as we progress into the temperature series to lower temperatures until there is no overlap possibility left.</p><p>When comparing the 4 different samples which were measured (toluene, 1% P3HT in toluene, 2% and 5%) and the temperature induced behavior of each of them, the following can be concluded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The best overlap can be found at higher temperatures and lower P3HT concentrations. Starting at concentrations of 2% and when decreasing the temperature, overlap becomes problematic. It is not clear why both SAXS series do not follow similar patterns upon temperature changes. The short S2DD series was initially recorded to be able to detect a signal which should be situated at approximately 4 nm -1 and would be a measure for crystallinity within our sample. This signal was not detected, as can be clearly seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref> (lowest temperature for the 5% sample). Additionally, the overlap problems pose a question as to which of both series of signals has to be taken into account as the one on which analysis can be built.</p><p>• Can we understand why in the overlap region between the 2 S2DD measured we see changes in slope when structure formation occurs at that length scale and with increasing concentration?</p><p>We were expecting to have the same scaling behavior in that region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remaining questions and discussion points</head><p>• We think to understand the low q-differences (at the short S2DD) the low q signal is all buried close to the beamstop region, making the signal at the short S2DD not accurate at the small q range. • At high q-range we would value the short S2DD data more highly and take those as representative. The high q-data of the long S2DD distance are very noisy due to bad sample to noise ratio so not accurate either. • There are problems with the intermediate q-range where both data sets should coincide better.</p><p>In the liquid state the agreement is still OK to acceptable for all compositions, but with the formation of the structure significant deviations start to set in. • When shifting the SAXS patterns, it is not clear if it is reasonable to use different shift factors within a single experimental series (e.g. 2% and 5%, for 1% this was not necessary). • The invariant for the short S2DD (as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) shows both a decrease and an unexpected shape.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
