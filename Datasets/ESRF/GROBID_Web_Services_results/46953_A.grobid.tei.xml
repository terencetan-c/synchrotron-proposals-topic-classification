<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>The goal of this experiment was to determine the speciation of rhodium in rhodium based catalysts. These are being used for the production of H 2 from methane by catalytic partial oxidation and coat a FeCrAl metallic foam that has a very high porosity and heat capacity. The catalysts are obtained by calcination of hydrotalcitetype (HT) compounds electrosynthesized on the surface of the foam. Previous characterization revealed that deposition of the catalytic materials by means of this new electrochemical process, yields a thin and stable catalyst layer coating the foams <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. An overview of the lifecycle of these rhodium catalysts, from "bare metallic foam" to "used catalyst" is given in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The catalysts produced under different experimental conditions were examined in three states: A, B and C. The different samples were embedded in polymethylmethacrylate, these resins were then cut and polished in a way that cross sections of different struts were free at the surface of the resin. Before any XANES measurements was done, XRF maps were taken of areas of interest. By setting a ROI of interest around the Rh-Lα fluorescence line these maps could then be used to localize Rh rich areas, of which XANES spectra could be taken. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement/data:</head><p>The flux (10 10 ph/s, for the measured samples using the zone plate focussing optics) made it possible to measure noise free XANES spectra in less than 20 minutes. The 0.22 by 0.85 microns beamsize allowed us to examine the thin Rh layer, which is not a lot thicker than 5 microns. A 0.5 micron step size could then be used for the XRF maps. On the downside the beam moved during the XANES energy scan, which made it difficult to acquire good XANES spectra of the heterogeneous Rh layer. Since the movement resulted in scanning regions with different Rh concentration and thus a higher or lower fluorescence intensity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and progress of evaluation:</head><p>For both the XRF mapping and the XANES measurements the PyMCA software package was used for the fittting of the XRF spectra , as is visualised in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The different states in combination with different synthesis conditions that have been analyzed, are summarized in table The experiment cleary revealed that after calcination and before reduction Rh is mainly present as a Rh spinel compound, as is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> for example. After reduction Rh is found also as Rh 0 in the measured samples in a relative concentration range of 21.37% -53.4% in relation to the spinel compound. Meaning that reduction is apparently not complete. After catalytic tests there is a relative decrease of Rh 0 (range 10.1% -38.7%) in respect to Rh in the spinel form. This indicates that the Rh is being partially oxidized during usage; however, the oxidation of the Rh by exposure to the atmosphere could not be discarded. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Guiseppe Fornasari -University of Bologna Prof. Koen Janssens -University of Antwerp Prof. Angelo Vaccari -University of Bologna PhD Patricia Benito -University of Bologna* Dr. Erika Scavetta -University of Bologna Mr. Wout De Nolf -University of Antwerp* Prof. Domenica Tonelli -University of Bologna Mr. Marco Monti -University of Bologna* Dr. Francesco Basile -University of Bologna Mr. Gert Nuyts -University of Antwerp* Report:</figDesc></figure>

For the XANES measurement a point of interest is scanned with a X-ray beam varying in energy and for each energy a XRF spectrum (b: spectrum with excitation energy 3005 eV) is recorded. After fitting these spectra the intensities of the Rh-L lines are given as a function of the excitation energy resulting in a XANES spectrum (e).Several points were measured on each sample, distributed over the entire sample area. The XANES spectra were then fitted with measured reference compounds, by means of linear combination fitting using the ATHENA software package. The reference compounds included several Rh x Mg y Al z HTs, calcined Rh x Mg y Al z compounds, Rh 2 O 3 oxide and Rh metal.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,137.50,362.65,320.30,184.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>
