<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>INTRODUCTION -Under conditions of metal excess the phytochelatin (PC) pathway represents a major metal tolerance mechanism in plants. <ref type="bibr">To plants, cadmium (Cd)</ref> is toxic even at low concentrations (&lt;10 µg g - 1 dry weight). Some plants are able to tolerate and accumulate &gt;100 µg Cd g -1 in their shoots. The role of PC in these plants remains unresolved, therefore phytochelatin synthase (PCS) knockdown lines (PCS-RNAi lines) with more than 90% (strong lines) or more than 60% (intermediate lines) reduction of PCS transcript were generated for a Cd hyperaccumulating plant, Arabidopsis halleri. These lines had significantly decreased shoot biomass when grown in 10 µM Cd for 6 weeks in hydroponics indicating a role of AhPCS in Cd hypertolerance. The aim was to study Cd distribution and Cd local chemical environment in these lines and in non-transgenic control plants to conclude on the role of PC in Cd tolerance in this plant.</p><p>EXPERIMENTAL -Plants (non-transgenic control line (CL), strong (2.5RNAi) and weak (3.5RNAi) PCS RNAi lines) were grown in hydroponics without or with 10 µM Cd (as Cd sulphate). Fresh plant material was frozen in propane cooled with liquid nitrogen and cryo-sectioned at -25 °C. The measurements were performed using the SXM set-up equipped with cryostat. The excitation energy for the scan was first set to 3.55 keV (i.e. above the Cd-LIII edge) to record maps of Cd, P, S and Cl simultaneously below the potassium K edge in order to avoid the strong K signal. Finally, the Cd LIIIedge XANES spectra were recorded in different plant tissues and cells, depending on local Cd concentrations, to determine Cd chemical environment. CdLIII-edge XANES spectra of standard reference materials were also measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>-Two dimensional maps of Cd distributions in roots, petioles and leaves were generated at E=3.55 keV (e.g. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, distribution of Cd in red, S in green and P in blue) and revealed homogeneous distribution of Cd in petioles and leaves, while in roots, Cd was located in cortex. Cd-LIII edge XANES spectra were recorded on selected hotspots in different tissues (in control line 14 spectra in roots, 18 in petioles and 24 in leaves and in 2.5RNAi line 13 spectra in roots, 16 in petioles, 27 in leaves); selection of spectra is shown in Fig 1B ). All XANES spectra measured on plant tissues can be described as linar combination of three reference XANES spectra, measured on standard reference Cd compounds, namely Cd-glutathione (representing Cd-S complex), Cd-pectin and Cd-oxalate (both representing Cd-O complex). Plant organs and tissues differed in relative amounts of Cd ligands, from intermediate amount of Cd-S ligands in roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), to predominant Cd-S ligands in leaves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) and only minute amounts of Cd-S ligands in trichomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). In general, roots and petioles of 2.5RNAi had smaller amounts of Cd-S ligands than the control line, while in leaves the 2.5RNAi line had greater amounts of Cd-S than the control line. Analysis of weak PCS RNAi line 3.5 was performed only in bulk (whole leaves and roots). No differences in Cd-S contribution between the weak PCS RNAi line 3.5 and the control line were observed, therefore detailed analyses were not pursued. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Cadmium localisation and ligand environemnt in tissues of Arabidopsis halleri control line and strong PCS-RNAi line (2.5RNAi).
