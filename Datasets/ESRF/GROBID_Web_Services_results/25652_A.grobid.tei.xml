<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) of Fe-40Al at.% ball milled powders, was studied at the Fe K-edge, as a function of pressure, from 0 to 12 GPa.</p><p>The as-milled powders had been previously structurally and magnetically characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) at ambient pressure. From a structural point of view, the as-milled powders had been found to be atomically disordered and to exhibit a 0.8 % lattice expansion, with respect to unmilled powders. From a magnetic point of view, although unmilled Fe-40Al at.% powders are paramagnetic, the milled powders show a strong magnetization (M S = 75 emu/g). This magnetim was attributed to both the milling induced structural disorder and cell expansion <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The goal of this experiment was thus to separate the two contributions (disorder and lattice expansion) to the magnetism of Fe-Al alloys.</p><p>High-pressure XMCD experiments were performed using a high-pressure diamond anvil cell, CuBe DAC, provided by Dr. F. Baudelet from Laboratoire de Physique des Milieux Condense Paris 6. Since XMCD spectra were taken for the first time on powdered samples (usually this type of experiment is performed on foils with a constant thickness instead of powders), several hours were required in order to mount the complete experimental setup and to obtain a very small and stable focused beam on the sample. For each pressure, in order to normalize the XMCD signal, the absorption spectra were recorded simultaneously to the XMCD spectra. Further, in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio a large number of spectra, taken using both polarities of the incident beam, were averaged. The XMCD were then taken at different applied presures. Typical absorption and XMCD curves are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As can be seen in the figure, in spite of the, a priori, difficulty of the experiment, the results were very successful. Actually, our results show, for the first time, that XMCD spectra can be recorded at the Fe K-edge on magnetic powders subjected to high pressures.</p><p>As can been seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, as the pressure is increased the area of the XMCD spectra decreases. This area reduction is more clearly seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, where the overall area enclosed by the XMCD peaks is plotted as a function of the applied pressure for two different runs. As can be seen in the figure, a reduction of the XMCD intensity is observed, progressively, for pressures between 2 and 6 GPa and the integrated signal tends to level off for larger pressures. This implies a reduction of the magnetic moment of the sample as the pressure is increased. Since the quasi-hydrostatic strong pressure probably causes a reduction of the cell parameter of the sample, this implies that the milling induced lattice expansion indeed contributes to the magnetism of these alloys. Actually, it can be infered from the results that the lattice expansion contributes 35% to the magnetic moment of Fe-40Al at. %. Assuming that the main effect of the pressure was only to reduce the lattice parameter, disorder should be the main contribution to the magnetism in ball milled Fe-Al alloys as proposed theoretically <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Nevertheless, despite the novelty of our results, further studies are necessary to fully understand the effects. First, it is necessary to study the structural changes occurring under pressure on this alloy, to make sure that the main effect of the pressure is inded to to reduce the lattice parameter and, for example, to disregard any pressure-induced phase transformation. Moreover, the study of other ball milled Fe x A l-x should confirm the role to the lattice expansion in the magnetism of Fe-Al alloys, especially taking into account that it has been theoretically prerdicted that the role of the lattice parameter becomes more important for larger Fe contents [2].</p><p>[1] X. <ref type="bibr">Amils et al.
