<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Insights into the catalytic mechanism of an essential eukaryotic glycosyltransferase</p><p>Experiment number: MX-1230 Beamline: BM16 Date of experiment: from: 10th to: 11th December Date of report: 27-05-2011 Shifts: 2 Local contact(s): Daniele de Sanctis Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Ramón Hurtado-Guerrero University of Zaragoza BIFI -Edificio I + D Report:</p><p>-POFUT: we did UV-RIP experiments with different crystal types. We could not get the structure from these experiments because in general the crystals diffracted with splitted reflections. We tried a large number of crystals but as I said above, we did have many problems with the diffraction pattern of these crystals. The most succesful experiment was that we managed to get a high resolution of a native crystal (apo-form) for the first time. At the end we were also able to solve the structure using a high redundant data set taken at home combined with phase extension of a high resolution data set collected at BM16. We have just submitted a manuscript with the structure of this protein in combination with site directed mutagenesis. These studies describe the first crystal structure of these family of proteins and from this work, we have been able to propose a new exciting catalytic mechanism. We hope that we can publish it soon. -With the remaining time that we had, we collected data for crystals of the C-terminal of Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FAD synthetase in complex with ADP and Anabaena FNR S80A in complex with FAD and NADP + (mutant involved in the transfer of electrons in this type of protein).</p><p>As a brief explanation of these two above proteins: FAD synthetase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cofactor FMN and FAD and is essential in a large number of pathogenic organisms; and FNR is another essential enzyme catalysing the reduction of NADP + to NADPH during photosynthesis. We have already gone to BM16 with crystals of these two proteins We have been able to solve the structures of these two proteins by molecular replacement techniques. Both proteins were complexed with different ligands in order to understand their catalytic mechanism.</p><p>The trip to ID23-1 was good in general although the main reason of the trip, to solve the structure of POFUT by UV-RIP, was not achieved. We managed to get better resolution for native POFUT, FAD synthetase C-terminal in complex with ADP and for Anabaena FNR S80A in complex with NADP + plus FAD.</p></div>		</body>
