<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the beamtime was to develop and test a new method for a direct determination of the positions of individual stacking faults in a single wurtizte (WZ) [0001]-oriented GaAs nanowire, based on diffraction of a very narrow coherent x-ray beam. The method suggest to measure the reciprocal-space distribution of diffracted intensity along an asymmetric crystal truncation rod (CTR) comprising the maxima 224 of the cubic zincblende lattice (ZB), 01-15 of the WZ lattice and 331 of the twinned ZB (TWZB) lattice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a sketch of the maxima positions in reciprocal space, ZB, TWZB and WZ maxima are denoted by black, blue and red symbols, respectively. From numerical simulations it follows that the Fourier transformation of the measured intensity distribution (the Patterson function) calculated along the section of this CTR between the maxima exhibits peaks, the positions of which directly correspond to the positions of individual fault planes. Therefore, this method could allow for a direct determination of the positions of the fault planes without complicated and time consuming phase-retrieval.</p><p>We have investigated a GaAs sample with (111) ZB oriented surface, on which epitaxial nanowires have been grown by the self-assisted MBE growth [1], Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a typical SEM image of the sample. From the figure it is obvious that few tens of nm thin and approx. 1 m long nanowires grow from facetted islands lying directly on the substrate surface. According to the growth parameters and preliminary laboratory x-ray diffraction investigations we expected that the wire structure is predominantly WZ, while the islands underneath have the cubic ZB lattice.</p><p>The synchrotron measurements have been carried out at the ID01 beamline, using the primary beam with the energy of 8 keV. The fully coherent beam was focused down to 200 nm by a Fresnel zone plate, the form of the wavefront of the primary beam was determined by a sequence of images taken at various FZP-detector distances.</p><p>Using a fast K-mapping procedure [2] we found a suitable isolated nanowire, from which we have measured a large three-dimensional reciprocal-space distribution of diffracted intensity, using an offset omega-2theta scan and a large two-dimensional detector. During the scan we have checked the stability of the sample and performed a xy optimization of the sample position if necessary. The measurement procedure has been carried out on several nanowires; we tried to identify the particular nanowires by comparing the K-mapping image of the sample with optical micrographs. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we show an example of the obtained data integrated in the Q y direction perpendicular to the scattering plane. All three types of maxima are present; the 224ZB peaks stems mainly from the substrate; this peak cannot be avoided. The 331TWZB and 0-115WZ originate in the nanowire and in the island underneath. From the data it follows that in contrast to our previous expectations the island is predominantly wurtzite similarly to the nanowire, since the wurtzite peak exhibits oblique streaks perpendicular to the facets of the island. This finding makes the direct application of the suggested method complicated, however we tried to discriminate the nanowire and the island contributions by changing the sample z position; The next step will consist in extracting the contribution of the irradiated nanowire from the measured threedimensional distribution and in calculating the corresponding Patterson function.</p><p>[1] C. <ref type="bibr">Colombo et al., Phys.
