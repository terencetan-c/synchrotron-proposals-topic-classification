<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Summary</head><p>The experiment was aimed at measuring the dependence of cross-plane thermal conductivity of graphite on sample thickness. Strain was induced in nano-graphite films of various thicknesses by excitation with an ultrafast laser. The time dependent evolution and relaxation of strain along c-axis (i.e. cross-plane) of graphite was subsequently probed by following the x-ray 002 Bragg reflection. Dynamics of strain were fitted to an empirical model, from which key parameters relating to the heating and relaxation processes were extracted. Preliminary analysis suggests dependence of the relaxation timescale on both film thickness and incident fluence. A comprehensive model based on heat diffusion is needed in order to separate the competing effects that contribute to the observed dynamics, and consequently extract the thermal conductivities of the different-thickness samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental setup</head><p>Measurements were conducted at the time-resolved studies beamline (ID09B) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. The silicon monochrometer of ID09B was used to produce 15.2 keV x-rays with ~2×10 -4 Bandwidth. The x-ray pulse duration was ~70 ps and the x-ray pulses were synchronized to the Ti:Sapphire laser system within ~50 ps.</p><p>Samples were excited with 800 nm light at normal incidence, while x-rays were incident at the 002 Bragg angle (~7 o ) relative to the sample surface. The laser beam was focused along one direction using a cylindrical lens. The laser spot size at the sample was measured to be ~2.5×0.5 mm 2 , which is sufficiently larger than the ~0.35×0.12 mm 2 x-ray foot print on the sample. The experiments were conducted at incident fluences in the 3.4 to 41 mJ/cm 2 range. The 002 Bragg reflection was captured on the frelon 2D detector. For each sample and excitation fluence, a series of images were recorded at different time delays in the -3 ns to 100 ns range as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results and discussion</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the time dynamics of the shift in the position of the 002 reflection at an excitation fluence of 27 mJ/cm 2 . The data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> is representative of all other measurements performed at different samples and over the whole range of incident fluences. The time dynamics feature an initial fast build-up of strain (~100 ps) and a relaxation to a level above room temperature occurring on a much slower timescale (~2 ns). The timescale of the initial build-up is limited by the instrument response time rather than the actual structural dynamics. Relaxation of strain, on the other hand, is dictated by heat diffusion through the nickel substrate. The data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> (open circles) were fitted to a function comprised of an error function multiplied by an exponential decay function (solid line).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> is a summary showing the 3 key parameters obtained from the fit for measurements conducted over the whole fluence range. The top panel in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is the maximum amount of strain induced in the film. Strain increases with excitation, exhibiting a linear dependence as expected. Relaxation timescale (middle panel) increases with excitation level. The behaviour could be related to a change in thermal conductivity as function of sample temperature. It is known that c-axis thermal conductivity in graphite is dominated by phonons and exhibits a 1/T dependence (K. <ref type="bibr">Sun et al., Superlattices and Microstuctures 45 (2009)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr">[64]</ref>. Lastly, the bottom panel shows the residual strain left in the graphite film. It is interesting that the film does not relax back to room temperature strain-level within the 100 ns time frame of the measurements. The residual strain suggests heating of the underlying nickel substrate. The next step of the analysis will focus on modeling heat diffusion through the film-nickel structure using a 1-D model akin to what has been previously employed <ref type="bibr">(M. Harb et al. Applied Physics Letters 101 (2012) 233108)</ref>. The 1/T dependence of thermal conductivity will be included in the model. The objective will be to extract the room temperature thermal conductivity for the various thickness samples and investigate the origin of thickness dependence which has been proposed by theory (K. Sun et al., <ref type="bibr">Superlattices and Microstuctures 45 (2009)</ref>  <ref type="table">60</ref><ref type="table">61</ref><ref type="table">62</ref><ref type="table">63</ref><ref type="table">64</ref>). -3000 ps -40 ps -20 ps 0 ps 20 ps 40 ps 60 ps 80 ps 100 ps 1000 ps 10000 ps 100000 ps Fig 1. Selected snapshots of the 002 reflection of graphite, captured at different time delays relative to excitation at an incident fluence of 27 mJ/cm 2 . The shift in the position of the diffraction spot to lower pixel values is indicative of c-axis expansion. Notice the "splitting" of the spot in the 20 ps and 40 ps frames. This is due to the x-ray pulse duration being larger than the timescale of thermal expansion in the film. -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0 2 4 6 8 Time (ns) Shift (pixels) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 Max strain (%) 1.5 2 2.5 Relaxation  c (ns) 0 20 40 0 0.05 0.1 Fluence (mJ/cm 2 ) Steady state strain (%) Fig 3.
