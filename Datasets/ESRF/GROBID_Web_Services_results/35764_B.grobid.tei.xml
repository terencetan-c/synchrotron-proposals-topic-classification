<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Recently it was shown that complex superstructures can be formed by T-shaped molecules with three incompatible segments. These molecules have a rod-like biphenyl or terphenyl core, to which a polar group is attached at each end and a long aliphatic chain in a lateral position ("bolaamphiphiles") <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Alternatively, an aliphatic chain is attached at each end and a polar (oligo-oxyethylene) chain with or without an ionic terminal group is attached laterally ("facial amphiphiles") <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. The experiments carried out at ID02 were designed to determine these structures, and to further our understanding of the principle of self-assembly in thermotropic amphiphiles.</p><p>Previous experiments performed on these T-shaped molecules have revealed a number of 2-d and 3-d liquid crystal phases with novel geometries <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows electron density maps of three related phases, reconstructed from synchrotron X-ray data <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Corresponding schematic molecular models are shown underneath. Rigid aromatic rod-like groups provide the walls of these novel honeycomb structures containing polar channels of different polygonal cross-sections. In addition to hexagonal honeycombs, structures with triangular, square and pentagonal channels were established, depending primarily on the geometry of the molecules, and the presence of ions or water. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, with decreasing volume of the polar group, the shape of the cross-section of the polar channels changes from pentagon (a), through square (b), to Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> mixed triangular and square (c). More complex modes of self-assembly have been found, by changing the relative size of the three incompatible segments. Some of these have 3-d order on the mesoscale, while still remaining liquid-like on the atomic scale.</p><p>In the first group of experiments we investigated facial amphiphiles with the relative length of polar chains reduced below those displaying the square-triangle lattice (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). A new liquid crystal phase, which is made up exclusively of triangular channels, has been found. A typical example of the reconstructed electron density map of this phase, with schematic drawings of molecular arrangement in the structure, is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The observation of this new phase further validates our models for these honeycomb structures made up of columns of polygonal cross-sections. When the volume ratio of polar chains in the system decreases, the ratio between the cross-section area of the columns to their circumferences should also decrease. This is achieved by reducing the number of sides of the polygons, hence the observed phase sequence: hexagonal ! pentagonal ! square ! mixed square and triangular ! triangular on decreasing length of polar chains.</p><p>An even more intriguing novel 2-d liquid crystal phase is found close to the triangular phase in a number of Tshaped amphiphiles. Preliminary X-ray experiments carried out on an oriented sample using an in-house instrument suggest a hexagonal lattice, with a large unitcell parameter. However, with the help of high resolution available at the synchrotron, it was found that what was considered as the first diffraction peak consists in fact of two closely spaced peaks. The plane group of the phase is thus determined to be p2gg. The reconstructed electron density map of this phase (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) reveals that the phase is also made up exclusively of triangular channels. However, the triangles are no longer equilateral but distorted. As shown by the schematic drawing of molecular arrangement on top of the electron density map (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), the molecular ends are further apart at one corner of each triangle than at the other two. By doing this the structure is able to support a slightly larger ratio of polar parts in the system, without changing the number of sides of the polygonal channels. This is in line with the fact that this phase is observed in between the triangular phase (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and the mixed square and triangle phase (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). The high resolution availabe at the synchrotron radiation source was crucial for the determination of this structure, which otherwise would not have been possible.</p><p>In addition to the two phases mentioned above, several other complex honeycomb structure have also been identified, and work is in progress on determination of their structures.</p></div>
