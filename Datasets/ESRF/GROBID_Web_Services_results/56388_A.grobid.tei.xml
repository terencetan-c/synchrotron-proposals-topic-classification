<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In spite of the serious electrical shutdown that occurred the 14 th of July, we've been able, thanks to the scientific and technical staff of ESRF, to use efficiently the allotted shifts. As proposed in the proposal we scanned two kinds of microfluidic devices: (i) devices with a static geometry (for fluid flow and inert tracer transport studies) needing a single mosaic-scan and (ii) a device with a dynamic geometry (for reactive fluid flow studies) requiring various scans at different times. We acquired a mosaic of 44 scans for the static geometry, 3 scans of the microfluidic device without reactive particles, and 18 scans corresponding to two reactive flow experiments. Unfortunately, for a still unexplained reason, it has been impossible to reconstruct correctly a single volume from these data sets. L Helfen worked hard on this problem looking for adapted reconstruction methods, but unsuccessfully. A test performed in December 2015 with an empty microfluidic device produced a data set for which no problem of reconstruction occurred. Consequently, the problem was not linked to the samples properties. A new experiment has been scheduled for April 2016.</p><p>The microfluidic device with its connexion bloc (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) has been placed on a sample holder machined at ICMCB after discussion with the local contact (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>On the projections CO 2 bubbles and needle shape particles were visible (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) indicating some possible experimental problems.</p><p>All the reconstruction methods gave 3D results like the one presented Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Horizontal sections (i.e. in the plane of the microfluidic device) were partly blurred, but informative (needle shape particles are clearly visible). Looking at perpendicular sections (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) the reconstruction problem clearly appeared: Presented images correspond to sections through the microfluidic device in the planes indicated by the black lines. The 3D volumes were unusable. This problem existed for the reactive flow experiments, but also for the static case as shown Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">7</ref>. The test performed in December 2015 gave good results as shown Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">8</ref> (reconstruction with only 25% of the projections). Fig. 2: Sample holder machined at ICMCB. Fig. 3: A projection with a crude flat field correction. Fig. 4: Horizontal section of a 3D volume reconstructed from a set of projections like the one presented Fig. 3.
