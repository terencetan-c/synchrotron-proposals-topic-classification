Additionally we had observed that the rate of transition was found to be strongly dependent upon the difference between the final pressure of the system and the pressure at the phase transition boundary.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> The p-T phase diagram for ME 30wt% H 2 0</p><p>These studies had to date focussed upon the kinetic and structural aspects of phase transitions in excess water lipid mixtures. During SC-1838 we wished to expand these studies to fixed hydration and other monoglyceride systems including 1monoolein and monomyristolein samples as such studies can provide valuable insights into the mechanism of fusion pore formation by allowing us to disentangle the effects of water transport. During our experiments at the ESRF we were able to successfully construct the equilibrium p-T phase diagrams for the 1monoolein/H 2 0, monoelaidin/H 2 0 (example in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and monomyristolein/H 2 0 systems at fixed binary ratios. These allowed us to interpret the ensuing results of the lyotropic phase transformations under study and build upon our previous measurements. We subsequently monitored the complete time evolution of the phase transitions of 1-monoolein, monoelaidin and monomyristolein systems (both excess water and fixed hydration samples) as a function of pressure jump amplitude. Highlights from our results include the observation that for e.g monoelaidin the transition pathways between the fluid lamellar and inverse bicontinuous cubic phases (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) bears obvious structural differences to that under excess water conditions including the absence of intermediate phases of crystallographic symmetry. However several structural features of the transition are deduced. These include the co-existence of a swollen Q II D cubic phase with the L α phase under equilibrium conditions (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), a characteristic decrease in lattice parameter of the L α phase and a well-defined linear trend of the rate of this decrease on the jumpamplitude (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). An increased level of disorder in the fluid lamellar phase throughout the transformation has been noted which we can now explain with reference to the effects of limited hydration on stalk formation. Measurements on monoolein demonstrated that stalk formation has a less pronounced effect on bilayer spacing for this system and that this is linked to the differences in the micromechanical properties of the system.</p><p>As for ME under excess water conditions, a swollen Q II D phase is observed to co-exist with the fluid lamellar phase in ME / 30 wt% H20 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). We have previously suggested that under excess water conditions this phase could act as a water storage vehicle relieving high curvature at the centre of the vesicular L α domains. It is interesting that such a phase may adopt a similar role even under limited hydration conditions. The transformation itself bears obvious differences to the L α -Q II D transition for the same lipid. In contrast to the complex structural route involving the presence of a number of intermediate swollen cubic phases (previously discovered during ESRF experiments) observed in excess water, no intermediate phases of crystallographic symmetry are observed during the L α -Q II G transition under limited hydration conditions. Instead the disappearance of the L α phase is accompanied by the appearance of diffuse scatter in the diffraction pattern from which peaks corresponding to the √6 and √8 reflections of the Q II G phase grow. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> depicts an example of the highly swollen structures we observed to co-exist with the L α phase. Diffraction peaks corresponding to this phase were initially broad but become more resolved with successive jumps eventually being resolved as a high lattice parameter Q II D phase. Although only two peaks were detectable for this phase, the intensity ratio and indexing were consistent with previous observations. The diffraction rings are fairly smooth indicating the presence of numerous, randomly oriented small domains. This is consistent with the theory proposed under excess water conditions that such a phase may exist at the centre of the onion vesicles where it acts to relieve high curvature elastic stress.</p><p>Immediately following pressure jump these swollen cubic intermediates display a sharp linear decrease in lattice parameter as expected following a jump to lower pressure. Despite peaks corresponding to this phase being weak it has been possible to extract intensity and halfwidth data. Using in-house technologies these intermediates may have remained undetected. The intensity and half-width are observed to remain generally constant right up until the disappearance of the phase. This is indicative of an abrupt annihilation of this phase. We noted that the lifetime of the phase is inversely proportional to the size of the pressure jump. In order for this sealed cubic phase to shrink whilst maintaining its symmetry, it must be able to burst holes in its outer layer in order to release water. This water may be used to facilitate the transition.
