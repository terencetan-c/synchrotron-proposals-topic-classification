<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Local structure of laser shocked Fe-6.6%wtO probed by XAS X-ray absorption Spectroscopy of Fe-6.6%wtO alloy under laser shock compression has been studied at ID24 in parallel with pure Fe samples. From the previous experiments performed at ID24 [Torchio et al. Scie. Report], we used the same geometry and target design (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The target is consisting on a multi-layer CH 4µm / Diamond 25µm / Fe-6.6%wtO 4.5µm / Diamond 25 or 50µm. The two diamond layers allow maintaining high-pressure for several ns (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which is required for probing with the 100ps synchrotron bunch. As seen in the hydrodynamic simulation, the provided laser intensity allowed to reach pressures above 300GPa, ie above the melting curve of Fe and Fe-O alloys.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Because the laser shock compression is intrinsically transient, it is necessary to perform delay scan between the laser pump and the X-ray probe and to catch the breakout time of the shock wave at the interface of Fe-O and the rear side diamond. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> -left shows X-ray absorption spectra obtained for Fe-6.6%wtO at similar laser intensities and for various delays between the pump and the probe. The indicated time delays, varying between 6 and 12ns are not absolute values. We notice that Fe-O samples show a series of phase transitions in function of the delay, first a bcc -hcp and finally an hcp -melt transition for later times. The sample remains in an hcp phase during several ns and intermediate mixtures are also observed. The melt appears at later timing, ie. 12ns. These observations would suggest that the melt is obtained during the ultrafast release of the wave and not along the Hugoniot itself. Indeed, hydrodynamic simulation (figure 1 -Right) shows that the diamond sandwich allows to maintain the pressure for ~3ns which is corresponding to the time during the hcp phase is maintained (figure 2-Left). 5 eV 6 in the XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy) range. However, these x-ray characterizations have not reached the energy resolution and level of detail achievable on synchrotron beamlines, even for samples under high static pressure-temperature conditions <ref type="bibr">7</ref> .</p><p>Here, we propose an alternative line of progress by combining the best possible x-ray characterization methods available at synchrotrons to dynamic compression 8,9 . This is based on a similar strategy as the one used by the static high pressure community, namely minimizing the volume of the compressed sample to achieve extreme pressures and take full advantage of the high brightness (10 14 photons/s/10 µ m 2 ), extreme stability (fluctuations of normalized intensity ≤ 0.002 at ~1 KHz frequency), high energy resolution (δ E/E ~ 10 -4 ), large spectral range (∆ E/E &gt; 10%) and small spot size (typically less than 10 µ m 2 ) of the synchrotron x-ray beam. The shocked states were generated by a portable 35 J laser. The laser pulse was focused to a diameter of ~90 µ m (high power density configuration) or ~350 µ m (low power density configuration), resulting in similar compressions as those obtained by kJ lasers on mm size samples. Measurements were performed at the energy dispersive x-ray absorption beamline ID24 10 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which has been recently upgraded. X-ray absorption fine structure, which includes XANES and EXAFS, is an element selective probe of the local electronic and atomic structure. Hence, it is well adapted for the characterization of WDM at the atomic level. Iron is a key constituent of terrestrial and exoplanets. Given its ubiquitous importance, Fe is often one of the first materials to be investigated with novel experimental techniques. With this in mind, the present data are thus compared to XAS measurements recently performed under dynamic compression at the OMEGA laser 4 and LCLS free electron laser facilities 11 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The sketch of the experimental configuration is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> panel a. In the dispersive geometry, a fan of x-rays is dispersed and focused on the sample by a curved crystal, so that the energy of each ray varies as a function of convergence angle. The transmitted photons are then detected by a position sensitive detector allowing the simultaneous collection of the whole spectrum, up to a 300 eV range above the Fe K-edge (7.112 keV). Data were acquired using a single x-ray pulse of 100 ps duration, during a 4-bunch mode configuration of the synchrotron storage ring that assures the highest number of photons per pulse and a maximum separation between pulses (700 ns). The x-ray spot could be focused down to 5 µ m × 7 µ m FWHM (H × V) to ensure that the probed part of the compressed sample was not perturbed by edge effects. The position sensitive detector equipped with 1024 Ge pixels was operated with an integration time of 680 ns and phase locked to the ESRF radiofrequency system, ensuring integration of the signal generated by a unique bunch of electrons in the storage ring. The absorption spectrum so acquired for the undriven sample (in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, panel b, the ref spectrum) shows fine structure features 25 µm 40 µm Diamond Fe-6.6%wtO Diamond CH Laser Figure 1 : Experimental set-up from Torchio et al.

Morard et al.). Even if the pressure and temperature ranges are not the same, this qualitative comparison allows gaining confidence in the melting signature during shock compression. Both static and dynamic compression of similar Fe-O alloys show the smoothing of the edge and of the EXAFS features. However, we observe differences on the first oscillations: the first XANES oscillation is more visible at late timing while the second oscillation quickly vanishes. At this point we want to stress significant differences w.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 entific RepoRts | 6:26402 | DOI: 10.1038/srep26402</figDesc></figure>

Panel (a) a curved Si-crystal focuses the polychromatic x-ray beam onto the sample. The beam transmitted by the sample diverges towards a position sensitive detectorwhere energy is correlated to position; in this way, the full EXAFS spectrum is acquired at once by a position sensitive detector with Ge pixels (1024). A long laser pulse (10 ns, up to 35 J, at 1057 nm) focused at the sample position, drives the compression wave in Fe. The Fe target consists of a 3.5 µ m iron layer sandwiched between two diamond windows. Panel (b) a series of typical single bunch XANES spectra obtained by changing the x-ray probe delay time with respect to the laser onset time, while keeping the same driving energy for each shot, shows that the compressed state is in the hcp phase and its thermodynamic conditions are stable over 2 ns at least.

In general it allows obtaining highquality X-ray absorption spectra [1]. The quality of the XANES spectra can be limited if important gradient exists in the sample. This is related with the fluctuations of the sample quality or the laser spatial profile. In our case, this might explain some nonsystematic features in our data. -The ultrafast thermodynamic pathway of laser shock compression, i.e. shock Hugoniot followed by a quick release has a strong impact on the observed data as it involves ultrafast changes of the pressure and temperature conditions during the shock process.</p><p>During the experiment, parallel measurements were also performed on pure Fe at the same laser shock conditions. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a comparison of Fe-6.6%wtO and pure Fe X-ray absorption spectra for similar laser intensity conditions (2.4 10 13 W/cm 2 ) and the corresponding studied pressure and temperature conditions along the shock Hugoniot and release. We can observe that the hcp and liquid features are different for Fe and Fe-6.6%wtO, especially around the edge, in the XANES part of the absorption spectra. Further advanced analysis is required to extract information from the measured spectra, especially in comparing this XANES feature with the well-known FeO XANES spectra and extracting Fe-6.5%wtO liquid densities if possible.
