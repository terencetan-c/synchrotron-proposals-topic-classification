<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Populations of droplets or particles dispersed in a liquid may evolve through Brownian collisions, aggregation and coalescence. We have found a set of conditions under which these populations evolve spontaneously toward a narrow size distribution. The experimental system consists of poly (methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) nanodroplets dispersed in a solvent (acetone) + non-solvent (water) mixture. The droplets carry a low surface charge, from ionic endgroups of the macromolecules. We used time-resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering with a stopped flow device at the sample position of ID02. We used an inversion procedure that relies on deviations from Porod's law to determine the size distribution of droplets. We find that the droplets grow through coalescence events: the average radius &lt;R&gt; increases only logarithmically with time while the relative width σ R / &lt;R&gt; of the distribution decreases as the inverse square root of &lt;R&gt;. We interpret this evolution as resulting from coalescence events that are hindered by ionic repulsions between droplets. We generalize this evolution through a simulation of the Smoluchowski kinetic equation, with a kernel that takes into account the interactions between droplets. In the case of vanishing or attractive interactions, all droplet encounters lead to coalescence. The corresponding kernel leads to the well-known "self-preserving" particle distribution of the coalescence process, where σ R /&lt;R&gt; increases to a plateau value. However, for droplets that interact through ionic repulsions, "large + small" droplet encounters are more successful at coalescence than "large + large" encounters. We show that the corresponding kernel leads to a particular scaling of the droplet-size distribution -known as the "second-scaling law" in the theory of critical phenomena -, where σ R /&lt;R&gt; decreases as &lt;R&gt; 1/2 and becomes independent of the initial distribution. We argue that this scaling explains the narrow size distributions of colloidal dispersions that have been synthesized through aggregation processes. Furthermore, the Smoluchowski approach can be used for quantitative predictions of the outcome of aggregation or coalescence processes that are hindered by repulsions. Reference [1].</p></div>

With moderate water additions (" w = 0.2 ≠ 0.5), the system reaches the two-phases region where it is supersaturated with respect to the polymer. The supersaturation S is the ratio of the actual polymer concentration to its equilibrium concentration, which can be read at the intersection of the tie line with the binodal line. Since the binodal line is quite flat, a small water addition above the binodal line produces a huge supersaturation. The composition used in the present study is displayed on the phase diagram and corresponds to a PMMA/acetone volume ratio of " PMMA /" a = 6.6 10 ≠3 and water volume fraction of " w = 0.33.
