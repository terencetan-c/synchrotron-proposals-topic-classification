<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The dynamics of the L α to Q D II phase transition, brought about by rapid changes in pressure have a number of common features, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>. Most importantly, we find the dynamics are only reproducible if samples are composed of topologically distinct, physically separated domains with a narrow size distribution (200+/-20 nm diameter in our case). This reproducibility can be clearly seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> which plots the lattice parameter as a function of time for the pressure and temperature jumps shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. A second set of data obtained from a jump of the same amplitude has been added to the plot. Initially, we always observe a weak and previously unreported signal from a highly swollen bicontinuous cubic phase, Q D II , of maximum spacing 232 Å, in coexistence with the fluid lamellar phase. The lamellar gel phase, which occurs below 15 o C at atmospheric pressure and above 1300 bar at 46.7 0 C, also coexists with a swollen primitive Q P II cubic phase of maximum lattice parameter 311 Å. Following the step change in pressure the lamellar phase always shrinks to a specific threshold interlamellar spacing, constant to within the resolution of our experiments before disappearing. The rate of decrease in interlamellar spacing increases in proportion to the pressure amplitude of the jump. This dependence is not observed during lamellar to nonlamellar transitions which do not involve the formation of stalks. During this phase the highly swollen bicontinuous cubic signal smears out, moves to higher scattering angle, and, coincident with the disappearance of the lamellar Bragg peaks, merges with a broad, featureless ring of scatter (marked X in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). After a period of a few seconds the diffuse scatter resolves itself into a set of peaks from intermediate inverse bicontinuous cubic phases, Q D II and Q P</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II</head><p>, which replace it. The intermediate Q D II and Q P II phases may be used for transport of water; the small curvature elastic energy associated with expanding channel size means this can be an energetically favourable way of increasing water flux through the sample.</p><p>The fact that dynamical reproducibility is dependent on uniform domain size is strong evidence for structural changes at the scale of the unit cell being topologically and geometrically coupled to structural constraints at the nanoscale; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. From polarizing microscopy we know that in the lamellar phase our samples consist of closely packed onion vesicles. Using cryo-TEM, we observe that upon transformation into the Q D II cubic phase, the rounded multilamellar vesicles are transformed into cubosomes of approximately the same dimensions as the onion vesicles. Smooth powder diffraction patterns obtained from these samples set an upper limit of the order of 1 µm on the domain size. These three observations suggest that the phase transitions that we record all occur within the confines of the vesicles we have formed. This sets significant constraints on local composition, diffusion and topology.</p><p>The fact that the disappearance of the highly swollen cubic phase after a thermodynamic jump is structurally continuous with the appearance of diffuse scatter is strong evidence that it exists inside the onion vesicle, in coexistence with the lamellar phase. This suggests that its function is to act as a seed for the growth of the bicontinuous cubic phases out of an initially only locally ordered bicontinuous phase (the source of the diffuse scatter). We hypothesize that the swollen cubic is located in the center of the onion vesicle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) removing the high energetic cost of filling the core with spherical bilayers of increasingly higher degrees of mechanically unfavorable curvature. It is interesting to note in this regard that the cubic phase lattice parameter is larger than the upper limit predicted by Bruinsma [Ref 3], who calculated that thermally activated vibrational modes would disorder the structure. However, with the swollen cubic phase anchored to a vesicle wall perhaps the structure becomes stabilized. When we make a thermodynamic jump we are heading in a direction in which the bicontinuous cubic phase will shrink. At the same time the lamellar lattice parameter is shrinking, which indicates that water being expelled from the cubic phase does not pass into or through the lamellar bilayers.</p><p>The shrinkage of the lamellar lattice is occurring at the same time that stalks are formed between bilayers.</p><p>From equilibrium temperature studies one expects a change in lattice parameter of the fluid lamellar phase of +1.5 Å kbar -1 . In every case the actual changes are significantly greater than this. We hypothesize that this is due to the formation of stalks. This will produce the observed effects only if the bilayers have excess area in the form of thermal undulations and, of course, these undulations are an absolute prerequisite for stalk formation itself (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). For fixed water volume between adjacent bilayers in an onion vesicle the formation of stalks will reduce the average bilayer spacing as it irons out undulations, while simultaneously imparting lateral tension in the bilayers. We know that rupture of the stalk to form a fusion pore is dependent on the presence of sufficient lateral tension to open up the pore. Our hypothesis is therefore able to rationalize the very specific and reproducible value of the threshold lamellar lattice parameter prior to the phase's complete disappearance.</p><p>The rupture of the fluid lamellar bilayer throughout the sample requires the concomitant movement of the water stored in the central, disordered bicontinuous structure through the pores (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This destroys lamellar symmetry, and with pores distributed over spherical surfaces and the initially rapid flow of both lipid and water there can be no initial cubic symmetry to replace it. Hence the broad unresolved peak during this stage of the process. The appearance of an initially highly swollen cubic phase from this broad peak is explained by the now slower flow of large volumes of water, allowing the reorganization of some parts of the domain into cubic regions. Regular, cubic arrays of pores are at a lower free energy than the random arrangement in phase X and the energetic cost of swelling the D and P cubic phases is not that great. At fixed lipid mass within the domain the shrinkage of these intermediate cubic phases can only occur via the growth of new unit cells, and hence an increase in topology (density of channels). This, by comparison with maintaining a swollen cubic phase, is clearly energetically costly as can be seen by the slow rate of growth of the equilibrium phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: Time Resolved Studies of the Lyotropic Phase Transitions of the Inverse Bicontinuous Cubic Phases in a Monoelaidin/Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Professor Richard Templer, Professor John Seddon * (Dept of Chemistry, Imperial College, UK), Professor Roland Winter (Dept of Chemistry, University of Dortmund, Germany) Report: CH-1898 Time Resolved Studies of the Lyotropic Phase Transitions of the Inverse Bicontinuous Cubic Phases in a Monoelaidin/H2O system Summary Our experiments as part of proposal CH-1898 proved extremely successful and have so far resulted in two high impact publications (Ref 1 and Ref 2). Our aim was to investigate the transitions between various lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases formed by the monoelaidin (ME) / water system, including the nature of any intermediates formed. For the first time, we have overcome the variability associated with dynamical measurements of lyotropic phase transitions and this has allowed us to record the dynamical process reproducibly in pressure-jump experiments. We have shown that the liquid crystalline lamellar (L α ) to double-diamond inverse bicontinuous cubic (Q D II ) phase transition resulting from pressure jumps exhibits a remarkable sequence of structural transformations. Our data indicate that the transition dynamics depend on a coupling between changes in molecular shape and the geometrical and topological constraints of domain size. As a result we have been able to propose a qualitative model (Fig 1) for this coupling based on theories of membrane fusion via stalks and an existing knowledge of the structure and energetics of bicontinuous cubic phases.</figDesc></figure>

The figures are scaled relative to each other to reflect our experimental observations. A spherical onion vesicle consisting of concentric bilayers is shown including the swollen cubic phase present at the center. Thermal undulations in the lamellar phase (a) disappear as interlamellar attachments (ILAs) are formed (b). This occurs because the bilayer's area and the volume it circumscribes are fixed in an onion vesicle and hence forming contacts exerts a lateral tension. When the tension reaches a critical value, ILAs rupture and form a disordered network of funnels (c) through which water flows from the center of the vesicle. The disordered sponge structure soon resolves into ordered bicontinuous cubic structures such as the swollen P cubic (d).</figDesc><graphic coords="2,28.56,674.88,171.00,123.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
