<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims and background information:</head><p>• To compare different forms of cross-linking (i.e. UVA/Riboflavin, glycaraldehyde, glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide (EDC) and transglutaminase) to see the effect of the procedure on the intermolecular spacing of collagen at different levels of hydration.</p><p>• To complete the preliminary work we carried out in the past at the ESRF, to show how collagen lamellae from the central cornea integrate with those in the periphery of the tissue, and understand further the role of collagen in the maintenance of normal corneal curvature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>Correlation of different corneal cross-linking methods in relation to hydration Ovine corneal strips were crosslinked using five different agents (i.e. UVA/Riboflavin, glycaraldehyde, glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide (EDC) and transglutaminase). A 4x4 mm central piece was dissected, weighed and exposed to the X-ray beam. Samples were then left to air dry for 1 and 2 hours and the weight/X-ray procedure was repeated. Finally, samples were dried for 3 days and the approximate hydration of samples was calculated and correlated to the changes in collagen intermolecular spacing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Lamellar integration in the peripheral human cornea A pair of normal human eye-bank corneas provided by the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), PA were examined. In our previous trip to the <ref type="bibr">ESRF (SC-2246)</ref> we examined all eight meridians of a left human cornea, gaining information on how the number and direction of fibrils populating the two (centrally) orthogonal preferred directions changes as one moves from cornea to limbus. In our trip in September 2009 to the ESRF (MD-434) we collected excellent data following the same procedure from a further pair of normal human corneas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation of different corneal cross-linking methods in relation to hydration</head><p>Various methods of cross-linking have different effects on the corneal stroma. Our results demonstrate very clearly that this effect is dependant on the level of hydration in the tissue. For example, at low hydration levels (i.e. H&lt;1) no collagen intermolecular spacing differences were observed between the different cross-linking treatments. Between hydration values of 1 and 6, glyceraldehyde had the most profound effect in increasing the intermolecular spacing of collagen within the corneal stroma (p&lt;0.01). However, the fact that glyceraldehyde does not induce any profound differences on collagen intermolecular spacing at low hydration (H&lt;1), below the critical level, shows that even this treatment of cross-linking does not prevent collagen collapse in the corneal stroma when the conditions become extreme.</p><p>Lamellar integration in the peripheral human cornea The wide-angle set-up of ID-13 used during the current trip yielded excellent results for the lamellar integration studies. The additional samples that we scanned gave us the oportunity to complete the existing set of data that we obtained in our previous trip <ref type="bibr">(SC-2246)</ref>. The data are currently being analysed and this should be completed soon. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1: The intermolecular spacing variation after different types of cross-linking</figDesc></figure>
