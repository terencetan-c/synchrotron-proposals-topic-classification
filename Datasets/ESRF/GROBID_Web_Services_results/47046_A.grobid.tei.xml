<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The signal recognition particle (SRP) functions as a molecular adapter coupling protein synthesis and membrane translocation. We are interested in the molecular mechanisms that govern the binding of signal sequences by SRP and downstream signaling. We perform biochemical, crystallographic and SAXS studies of an archaeal SRP, signal sequence and SRP-receptor. SRP54 is the critical protein component and comprises two major domains: the M domain, which anchors the protein onto the RNA and binds directly to the signal sequence, and the NG domain, which binds GTP and the SRP-receptor. It is beleived that the NG domain makes crucial domain movements during the signalling event, which ultimately lead to accelerated receptor interaction and signal sequence release. We have measured various samples containing the SRP, signal sequences and the SRP receptor. Some of the samples have to be measured again and some new samples have to be measured to gain conclusive results. These SAXS data will be complement by our ongoing crystallographic studies. The type III secretion system is a highly complex machinery that enables bacteria to deliver protein effectors across eukaryotic cellular membranes. Despite the ongoing concerted efforts of molecular and structural biologists, the role of many of the components which are required for assembly, regulation and function of this machinery remain unknown. We have measured distinct protein complexes of the type III secretion system. These SAXS data will be complemented by our ongoing crystallographic studies.</p></div>		</body>
