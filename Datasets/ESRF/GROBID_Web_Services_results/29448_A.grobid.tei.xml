<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have performed grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD) and x-ray reflectivity experiments on a series of thin films of the technologically important polyfluorene PF2/6.. Polymers such as PF2/6 (which is a branched side chain hairy-rod molecule) are some of the most promising class of electroluminescent polymers in thin film applications, such as organic light emitting diodes which are to be used in the displays of digital cameras or mobile phones instead of conventional liquid crystal displays. In order to obtain the desired photophysical properties suitable for device implementation there remain two major issues that need to be addressed: Firstly, a detailed understanding of the relationship between the photophysics and the intermolecular structure within the device environment; and secondly, how this structure is modified on the addition of energy transfer dopants.</p><p>As part of our continuing development of the optimisation of the first of these concerns we have undertaken several studies of the alignment of PF2/6 thin films <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In bulk the polymer selfassembles into a hexagonal (Hex) structure when the molecular weight, M n , is high. In PF2/6 thin films spun coated onto rubbed polyimide (PI), rigid PF2/6 chains (characterized by c axis, parallel to the rigid backbone) align and run parallel to the substrate along the rubbing direction of the PI (z axis). The PF2/6 shows two differently oriented coexisting crystalline types. Part of the structure is characterised as having the crystallites with the crystal axis (a) perpendicular (x) to (type I) and the other aligned parallel (y) to (type II) the substrate surface. There is large optical absorption and dispersion (over the spectral range 250-1000 nm) of the refractive index parallel to x axis and small absorption and dispersion of the refractive index perpendicular to it. Above a well defined threshold value M n *=10 4 g/mol, there is a phase transition from the Hex to the nematic (Nem) phase with increasing temperature. The theoretical phase diagram is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Schematics of the crystallite types and molecular structure in aligned hexagonal films are also shown. Unlike our previous work <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, in this experiment, we concentrated on understanding the relationship between the photophysics and the surface morphology in aligned films <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The surface morphology was studied as a function of M n in the range 3-150 kg/mol. Polarized microscopy, AFM, GIXD <ref type="bibr">(Fig 3 (a)</ref>) and x-ray reflectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) were employed. In particular, the aim was to highlight the relation between macroscopicsubmicron scale morphology to the self-organized intermolecular structure and the uniaxial alignment. At the threshold M n , M n *=10 4 g/mol, there is a distinctive transition in morphology from featureless (M n &lt;M n *) to rough (M n &gt;M n *) corresponding to the Nem-Hex phase transition that defines the phase boundary in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The Hex phase that reveals two coexistent crystallite types in the whole film also shows needle like domains (20-60 nm in size) at the surface but a rigorous microscopic picture on their internal structure cannot be given as yet. The study has enabled us to show that the optimal alignment and surface smoothness is achieved slightly below M n *. The combined optimum of orientational and local order however is achieved slightly above M n * when the roughness is smaller than far above M n *.</p><p>Adding suitable dopants is another crucial factor in refining key optical properties such as the fluorescence efficiency, and excited state lifetimes of the dopant/polymer derivative. Porphyrines have shown to be promising dopants for polyfluorene with the amount of spin-orbit coupling exerted to the host by the dopant controlled by the choice of the central metal atom of the porphyrin. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the grazing incidence diffraction profiles for a pure PF2/6 (a) and Zn doped porphyrin/PF2/6 derivate (b). The dopant has significantly reduced the degree of hexagonal alignment. We were unable to observe any resonant enhancement in the diffraction peaks close to the Zn K edge. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Raw GIXD patterns of aligned PF2/6 spun onto rubbed PI along the ((ab0) plane). On the left pure PF2/6 and on the right Zn doped PF2/6. The hexagonal order is clearly observed over several orders for both samples but there is an increase in disorder on addition of the Zn dopant. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): T.P.A.
