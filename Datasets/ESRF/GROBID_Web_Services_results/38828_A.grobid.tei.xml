<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The influence of shear rate at different temperatures on oriented structure formation is investigated by using    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure1: The figure shows the schematic drawing of the thermal history applied to study the structure development under shear. T 1 corresponds to the high temperature above melting point at which sample was kept for 2 minutes to remove the melt history, T 2 corresponds to the temperature at which shear was applied while T 3 corresponds to the room temperature.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The figure shows the 2D-WAXS patterns for the given HDPE of broad molar mass distribution at two different temperatures (125 0 Cand 60 0 C). The shear was applied at four different temperatures (136 0 C, 142 0 C, 145 0 C and 160 0 C) while the sheared samples were kept at isothermal condition at 125 0 C for 600s to follow the formation of oriented structures. Note that orientation tend to decrease when the shear was applied at higher temperatures suggesting the role of relaxation times and thermodynamical conditions.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,34.02,429.24,526.92,268.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: The figure shows the time resolved 3D plots of intensity (a.u) vs. 2θ (degrees) for full profiles after sample were sheared (100/s for 1s) at four different temperatures (136 0 C, 142 0 C, 145 0 C and 160 0 C). The onset of appearance of reflections 110 and 200 occurs early in (a) as compared to (d). Hence, onset of crystallization shifts to the lower side of temperature while shearing at higher temperatures.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,38.82,50.82,526.74,420.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The azimuthal offset between the maxima of 110 and 200 reflection suggest the overgrowth of twisted kebabs.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,34.08,36.84,527.22,429.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
