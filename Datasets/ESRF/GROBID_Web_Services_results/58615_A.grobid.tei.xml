<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the proposal referred to, was to study the nucleation and formation of ultra small AlOOH nanoparticles with the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) Technique.</p><p>In preparation for the project we refined a commonly chosen synthesis route for boehmite nanoparticles in such a way that it could be monitored at a beamline with our in-situ cell equipment at ambient as well as nonambient conditions. The experimental setup and all sample measurements were executed as scheduled. Data analysis with PDF shed light on the first few hours of crystal growth of AlOOH.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> depicts a capillary data set of a completed synthesis of AlOOH prepared in advance as reference for PDF analysis. Taking into account instrumental resolution parameters, an excellent fit of these fully aged particles was achieved in the course of the data analysis.</p><p>The averaged nanoparticle sizes were found to be 3.2 x 2.2 x 1 nm. As boehmite crystallises in Cmcm these values correspond to orthorhombic platelets consisting of 4 layers in average. The layer distances are found to be 10% larger than reported for boehmite single crystal structures. PDF data collected during time-resolved in-situ measurements were processed similarly and were found to show the following behaviour (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a/b</ref>).</p><p>Data was collected within two hours and reveal that the reaction process can be divided in three sections. The first section refers to one reactant in solution and a few early scans right after the addition of the second reactant which determines the start of the reaction. The second section shows a vanishing precursor and the first polynuclear clusters of the reactant monomers until the first stacking of distinct layers of the crystal structure. At that point (start of section 3) the boehmite consists of two layers and a diameter of 5.0 nm in ac direction. Further growth of the nanoparticles can be monitored as time progresses until in b direction a size of 2.5 nm is reached which corresponds to nanoparticles consisting of four layers. The significantly changing data was collected in the first few minutes of the synthesis and could not be resolved in detail due to a time resolution of 10s per output file. It appears that rapid changes in the molecular structure are averaged and, hence, accurate fits incorporating several species attempted yet to fail.</p><p>In addition, ligands used during the further AlOOH syntheses also lead to drastic changes in that early part of the measurement. To complement the study on the boehmite with focus on the nucleation phase of the nanoparticles, measurements with higher time resolution are aimed at for a successive beamtime. a) b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>and Structural Physics Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</figDesc></figure>
