<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this experiment was a proof-of-principle experiment to introduce a new experimental setup allowing frequency-dependent XDMR measurements in longitudinal geometry using hard X-ray spectroscopy. This setup is based on a stripline geometry which in principle allows to measure a wide (2-20 GHz) microwave frequency range in contrast to resonator-based XDMR which is limited to a few microwave frequencies. This new XFMR setup including electro-magnet was successfully implemented into the samplecube endstation of beamline ID12 allowing to simultaneously detect conventional FMR and XFMR. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> XANES and XMCD spectra are shown recorded with the cube's photodiodes and the XFMR setup for both Fe and Ni K-edge of our 200nm Permalloy sample respectively. Furthermore we recorded both conventional and X-ray detected FMR as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> at the photon energy of the maximum XMCD of the Ni K-edge.  The XFMR spectra were recorded for both helicities (σ+ and σ-) recording the absorption with the microwave power modulated on and off, respectively, to reduce background noise. For these spectra the photon energy was set to the value where the XMCD effect is maximal and the static magnetic field was swept. For the XANES-FMR spectra we added the spectra recorded for σ+ and σyielding a clear signal following the shape of the conventional FMR line detecting the reflected microwave power. For the XMCD-FMR we subtracted the spectra recorded for σ+ and σin order to extract a signal which is correlated to the change in XMCD due to the resonance. One can clearly see that the XMCD-FMR signal is hardly detectable despite accumulating spectra for almost one day. In order to yield better understanding of the XANES-FMR spectra we also recorded such spectra at the Fe K-edge shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (top) for different photon energies. The spectral shape is independent of the photon energy and therefore not associated with the element selective absorption as would be desirable. For further investigate this effect we put a Ni foil as filter in front of the photodiodes replacing the kapton filters in order to suppress not only the electrons but also the signal of lower energy photons at the Fe K-edge. With the Ni Filters the XANES-FMR signal was significantly reduced, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (bottom) so that it is hardly detectable. One possible explanation might be that the Ni foils suppress photons from diffuse scattering which in turn is susceptible to the ferromagnetic resonance of the sample. With the Ni filters the Ni K-edge could not be measured anymore however the hope was that the XMCD-FMR signal for the Fe K-edge shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> (top) would become more pronounced compared to the Ni (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, bottom) and Fe (not shown) K-edge XFMR signal. This however was not the case. In order to be able to modulate the applied microwave power at a frequency of 67Hz to facilitate lock-in detection rather than taking on/off differences, we used a Femto current amplifier instead of the standard electrometers and measured both FMR and XFMR using an SR 830 lock-in as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> (bottom). We also recorded XFMR spectra with constant applied magnetic field with the sample in resonance condition and sweeping the photon energy (not shown). For these spectra we found for some orientations of the sample with respect to the x-ray beam a Bragg peak susceptible to resonance of the sample leading to a strong signature in the spectra. In summary, we implemented the new (frequency dependent) FMR setup into the sample cube of ID12 allowing to detect FMR and XFMR sweeping both magnetic field and photon energy. We found a photon energy independent x-ray detected signal susceptible to the resonance (XANES-FMR) but no sizable XFMR signal. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig 2: FMR (blue) and XFMR (black) at the Ni K-edge.
