<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment aimed at using the Kossel effect in artificially grown planar X-ray cavities to excite fluorescence / resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at selected depths inside the cavity as well as enhance the obtainable signal through focussing the emitted signal into Kossel cones. In order to explore all dependecies of the effect most efficiently, a Von Hamos analyzer with a 2D detector was used to record the emission spectral and angular distributions at the same time, while scanning incident energy and incident angle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup:</head><p>The planar X-ray cavities were grown on super-polished silicon wafers with platinum layers to act as mirrors below the critical angle. Carbon was used as mostly transparent spacer medium and either metallic iron or iron oxide (Fe2O3) was grown in the centre of the cavity as sample layer. The cavities were irradiated by the x-ray beam at an adjustable grazing incident angle. A photodiode monitored the specular reflection of the beam and allowed to observe the "incident" cavity modes and their dependence on incidence angle and energy. The fluorescence was emitted from the cavity in cones of constant emission angle to the cavity surface (for each energy and cavity mode) and dispersed onto a 2D detector by a spherically bent Von Hamos analyser crystal. The crystal had a radius Photodiode of 250 mm and used the Si (333) planes to disperse horiziontally. The detector was placed behind the focus to conserve the information in the vertical direction. A Pilatus 300K-W 2D detector was used to record the Fe ùêæùõº emission lines while resolving the emission angle from the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results:</head><p>The iron fluorescence shows a strong modulation with emission angle, as is visible on each detector image (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Thus, each acquisition maps the fluorescence intensity as a function of emission angle and emission energy. However, the fluorescence also depends strongly on both the incident energy and incident angle of the synchrotron beam onto the cavity. This dependence was carefully mapped by scanning incident angle and incident energy, while recording the 2D detector images as well as total fluorescence and the specular reflection intensity with two separate photodiodes. Apart from smaller datasets on a cavity with metallic iron, the main result of this beamtime comprises of a four-dimensional dataset on a cavity with Fe2O3, mapping the fluorescence intensity over the incident energy (7.1 keV to 7.15 keV), incident angle (0.32 ¬∞ to 0.46 ¬∞), emitted energy (6.38 keV to 6.41 keV) and emission angle (0.0 ¬∞ to 4.0 ¬∞).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Encountered Problems:</head><p>Initially, we observed only weak signals and a substantial amount of stray light. This was mitigated by covering most of the beam path with a helum-filled pipe and by shielding potential stray light paths to the detector with lead. Furthermore, we observed degradation of the cavity performance over time, which we connected to a growing contamination layer on the cavity surface under X-ray irradiation in air. A rough vacuum hood with Kapton windows was built around the cavity and reduced further contamination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Quality:</head><p>While the dataset on the metallic iron cavity only spans a small parameter space in input energy and angle with consistent quality (due to the problems mentioned above), the four-dimensional dataset of the Fe2O3-containing cavity shows a variety of interesting effects (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) with good and publishable data quality. The observed effects have more structure than expected from a simple model and quantitative simulations are ongoing for a detailed explanation. We currently plan to publish the data in two papers. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Fluorescence yield from Fe2O3 ,integrated over emission angle (0 ¬∞ to 4 ¬∞) and energy (6.38 keV to 3.41 keV), covering four modes of standing waves of the incident beam within the cavity. For modes with the standing wave maxima within the sample layer (at incident angles 0.41 ¬∞ and 0.32 ¬∞), the inelastic signal is enhanced, while it is suppressed for modes with the node located at the sample layer (at incident angles 0.45 ¬∞ and 0.36 ¬∞).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematic layout of the X-ray cavity and spectrometer setup at the ID20 beamline.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,263.68,597.00,291.52,168.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>
