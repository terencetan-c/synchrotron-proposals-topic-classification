Gutt, M. Paulus*, M. Sprung*, C. Krywka* Report:</p><p>We report an in-situ grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) experiment to study aqueous solution-gas interfaces of the sodium halogenides NaCl, NaBr and NaI.</p><p>The out-of-plane diffuse scattered signal yields information about the lateral structure of the investigated samples surface while detector scans performed at low out-of-plane angles give information about vertically conform structures. The scattered signal can be described using the capillary wave model. Using the Disorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) for data analysis, the wave vector dependence of the surface energy can be determined. GID scans of solutions (5 molar) and pure water were performed up to a wave vector transfer parallel to the surface q || of approximately two invers Angstroms. Furthermore, detector scans were recorded at an out-of-plane angle of 0.5°.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> the measured data for the salt solutions and pur water are displayed together with theoretical calculations of the scattered signal based on DWBA using both, a constant surface energy (dashed line) and a wave vector dependent surface energy (solit lines) based on the work of Mecke et al PRE 59 (6) 6766 (1999). For a better description of the data, measurements of the bulk structure factors of all liquids were performed. The refinements of these measured structure factors were included in the calculations of the diffuse scattered signal. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> the wave vector dependent surface tensions which was used in the calculation of the scattered signal is shown. We observe for all liquids a reduction of the surface energy at short length scales which seems to be similar for all liquids. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the corresponding detector scans performed at an out-of-plane angle of 0.5°. The absence of oscillations in all scans indicates that no formation of conform fluctuating layer takes place at the liquid-gas interface of all samples.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: GID scans of water (circles), NaCl (squares) -, NaBr (triangles) -NaI (diamonds) aqueous solution measured at ID10b, ESRF.
