<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: CONFIDENTIAL</head><p>The goal of this experiment was to collect a full data set of mGlu 5 receptor bound to agonist and a positive allosteric modulator. Around 20000 movies were collected at 0.84Å/pix sampling. Images were processed using cryosparc. Very good 2D classes revealing intact molecules were obtained (Fig1) and 3D reconstruction was obtained and refined to an overall resolution of ~3.0Å. In short , we have obtain a map that allowed to build water molecules in the large extracellular domain of the receptor, agonist in the binding site and also to analyse the stabilising effect of PAM on receptor active state. As part of this data set, we also identified population of particles visually identical to mGlu 5 inactive state receptor (i.e., with the TM domain separated apart) and the number of particles was sufficient for medium-resolution EM reconstruction to ~4.1Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This structure reveals a closed conformation (c) of the VFTs, with agonist bound, but stabilised in an inactive (R) state, which we propose to be in an intermediate-active conformation, Rcc (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Alltogether with additional mGlu 5 structure representing several other PAM bound conformation of the receptor, this work will make an significant impact in the field as part of the publication entitle "Conformational diversity in class C GPCR positive allosteric modulation" that has be submitted for publication and also deposited to preprint server for biology, BioRxiv. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. 2D classification of mGlu 5 receptor bound to agonist and positive allosteric modulator (A), and for intermediate active state Rcc (D). CryoEM maps coloured according to the local resolution plot of Full-lenght mGlu 5 as determined with Relion 4.0 are shown in two different views for agonist-and PAM bound state (B) and quisqualate-bound intermediate active state Rcc (E). Corresponding Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves of two half-maps with mask (blue) and the map and model (red) are shown (C and F).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,67.05,135.20,453.55,610.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
