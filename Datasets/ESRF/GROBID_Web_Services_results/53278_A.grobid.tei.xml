<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We collected transmission in situ XAS data and high resolution powder X-ray diffraction on single site copper-gold silica aerogels, hierarchical SAPO-34 and the conventional SAPO-34 during separated reaction stages of selective oxidation of propene. The XAS data was collected in the quick-scan mode, and powder diffraction data was collected at the end point of individual treatments. This beamtime is a follow-up from our SNBL beamtime in February (01-01-921) with focus on reproduction of the most interesting results and improvement of data quality.</p><p>We conducted three extensive studies. The samples were reduced in H2 (5 %) to 350 °C using a ramp rate 5 °C/min to study the formation of AuCu bimetallic particles, possible sintering effects in C3H6 (1.1 %) and O2 (1.1 %) feed for selective oxidation of propene.</p><p>Subsequently, H2 (0.33 %) was co-fed to study possible bimetallic regeneration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Both samples (Cu-Au aerogel and H-SAPO-34) show the formation of bimetallic clusters at 350°C in H2. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows average coordination numbers obtained by EXAFS analysis of the CuAu aerogel in H2, C3H6/O2 (propox) and during H2 co-feed (H2-propox). Least-squares refinement at the Cu k-edge show small Cu(0) clusters with NCu-Cu ~ 4, while Cu…Au interaction was not confirmed. However, the Au L3-edge reveal predominant Au…Cu interaction with NAu…Cu ~3, and the XANES-features at the Au L3-edge show characteristic AuCu bimetallic features rather than the bulk-like features. These results indicate a mixture of well-dispersed Cu(0) clusters and CuAu clusters. The switch C3H6/O2 feed led to partial reoxidation to Cu(I)/Cu(II) causing the characteristic AuCu bimetallic features in Au XANES to disappear. However, a composite O + Cu/Au contribution is confirmed at both Cu and Au edges. Co-feeding with H2 causes a significant increase in the Cu…Au contribution (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The cluster sizes are rather small in both systems, indicating that they are within the confines of the micropores present in the aerogel and H-SAPO-34 structure.</p></div>
