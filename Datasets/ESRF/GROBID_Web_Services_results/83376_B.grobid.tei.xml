Experiment title: Real-time radiography of the primary spray break-up using single-and multi-bunch exposures Experiment number: MA 3479 Beamline: ID 19 Date of experiment: from: 16/07/2017 to: 18/07/2017 Date of report: 08/09/2017 Shifts: 6 Local contact(s): Margie Olbinado Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Lukas Helfen, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology* Richard Welss, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg* Alexander Durst, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg* Sebastian Bornschlegel, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg* Report (Proposal Ref No: 53754):</p><p>The second measurement campaign took place during the storage ring was run in uniform filling mode. Hence, a quasi-continuous beam is achieved. The aim of this campaign was mainly to figure out different propagation distances between sample and detector and the suitability of the uniform filling mode for velocity distribution spray measurements. As the multiple exposure approach, described in the report from the May session, is not possible with a quasi-continuous beam, we focussed on measurements with the Shimadzu HPV-X ultra-high speed camera in this measurement campaign.</p><p>To be able to capture stochastic spray processes with another measurement technique simultaneously, we used shadowgraphy. Therefore, a first prototype of a spray chamber was designed. The constant volume chamber has two capton windows for the x-ray beam and orthogonal to the beam two glass windows to enable the shadowgraphy measurements. To avoid an explosive atmosphere within the chamber, it is continuously scavenged by nitrogen. A vacuum pump together with valves at the in-and outlet of the chamber, allows a control of the chamber pressure from 20 mbar to 1 bar. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the used constant volume chamber. Also for the uniform filling mode, a comparison of different scintillator materials was carried out. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a variation of fuel pressure from 50 bar to 250 bar with a multi hole injector for both scintillators. All images were captured with the Shimadzu HPV-X. As the nozzle outlet velocity is directly linked to the injection pressure, also the spray velocity increases with pressure. In the images the higher decay time of the LuAG:Ce scintillator becomes obvious. During the LYSO:Ce scintillator gives clear images, also for 250 bar injection pressure, the LuAG:Ce scintillator shows relatively sharp pictures for 50 bar, but for 250 bar motion blurring becomes very strong. Therefore, for following investigations with, the LYSO scintillator will be used due to its better dynamic behaviour. Another important approach was the estimation of the ideal propagation distance for phase contrast measurements. Finding the ideal propagation distance always is a compromise between more contrast through more distance and losing signal by absorption of the x-rays in the air. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows two different images with 5.3 m and 4.5 m propagation distance. A distance of 4.5 m turns out to be the best compromise, delivering good phase contrast and an acceptable signal to noise ratio. Reducing the distance, results in lower phase contrast, during a higher distance leads to a signal loss. The signal was found to decrease 25 % by 1 m additional propagation through air after the constant volume chamber. To reduce beam extinction through air, helium flight tubes were installed before the chamber and between chamber and detector. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows a shadowgraphy image of the whole spray next to a x-ray image of the near nozzle region from the same spray event. The experimental session during the uniform filling mode showed that velocity measurements principally are possible with a quasi-continuous beam, using the Shimadzu HPV-X ultra-high speed camera. Nonetheless the desired multiple exposure images with the Photron Fastcam SA-Z can only be done in 16-bunch filling mode. Moreover, also the Shimadzu HPV-X camera is delivering clearer images with more contrast in the 16-bunch mode.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure 1: Constant volume chamber used for the spray measurements</figDesc><graphic coords="2,404.40,457.75,152.14,308.92" type="bitmap" /></figure>
