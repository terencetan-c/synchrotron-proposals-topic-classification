<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment goal was to perform in-situ XAS measurements on iridium oxide (IrO x ) layers as electrocatalysts for electrochemical processes that are fundamental in the field of energy conversion. In particular, the oxygen evolution reaction was considered:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">H 2 O = 4e -+ 4H + + O 2</formula><p>(1) Iridium oxide is well known for its high performances as electrocatalytic material for the OER in acidic environment and its properties are likely extendable as a promoting agent in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices. However, most of the details on the reaction mechanisms and on the origin of IrO 2 activity are still lacking. In particular, changes in the oxidation state and structural modifications of iridium oxide during the oxygen evolution process are still not completely understood. The experiment CH-3511 allowed us to:</p><p>1-design and test a spectroelectrochemical cell that allows electrochemical in-situ XAS measurements 2-Understand the possibilities and the limits offered by electrochemical in-situ XAS 3-Development of a new method for rapid evaluation of oxidation state in dependance on the potential applied to the electode 4-perform XANES, EXAFS and qEXAFS in-situ to shine light on the reaction mechanism All experiments are carried out at the Ir-L3 edge (fluorescence mode).  The spectro-electrochemical cell shown in Fig.1 allows to use a three-electrodes configuration and contains the electrolyte solution. A hole in the frontal part allows the X-Rays to hit the sample and the fluorescence radiation to reach the detector. The working electrode is made of a dispensable screen printed electrode made of carbon on which IrOx is deposited. The experiments were conducted controlling the electrochemical instrumentation (CH Instrument 633D potentiostat/galvanostat) from the control room. Three main different types of experiments were carried out: 1-Record EXAFS spectra while keepeng the working electrode at a fixed potential value. The data are still under elaboration but it is already clear that the potential strongly influences both the position of the white line and the EXAFS signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2-Record qEXAFS spectra while the potential is varied following a stair-step potential profile.</head><p>In this case the energy corresponding to the white line peak was mainly considered. qEXAFS allows to quickly record spectra relatively to a high number of potential values. Preliminar results are in agreement to those obtained by EXAFS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-Record the fluorescence signal at a fixed X-Ray energy as a function of the applied potential</head><p>This represents a novel method to rapidly screen the X-Ray absorption features of the electrode material in a desired potential window. The energy is selected according to the white line peak as recorded for an IrO 2 reference sample. Any deviation from the maximum of the fluorescence (located at about 1.0 V) indicates the averaged transition of Ir sites oxidation state from (IV) to other values: e.g. (III) or (&gt;IV).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1 shows an image of the cell used during the experiment inside the BM-08 hutch.</figDesc></figure>
