<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Once the original proposed project was completed, the remaining 5 shifts were dedicated to new experiments with the newly designed BOOMBEN setup, which consisted of a heating element furnace surrounded by teflon material and stainless lid. Such a setup was used to conduct rapid magma fragmentation experiments throughout the remaining five shifts of the beam session. The success of the experiments achieved with this setup allowed the preparation of the new proposal on magma flow in volcanic conduits for the March 2022 deadline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>X-ray tomography and acoustic emissions of in situ, time-resolved magma fracturing: insights into the causes of explosive volcanic eruptions The beam session started with one issue that cost the loss of three entire shifts. An update of NABU/TOMWER made reconstruction not possible and no visual of the sample was possible at the time. Configuration of the setup could not be confirmed and launching the experiment was not making sense unless we could be sure that data could be exploited. After writing a workaround script to give us a temporary visual on the sample, experiments could be started.</p><p>At the beginning of the fourth shift, experiments using the KORE apparatus were performed and data were acquired efficiently through the seventh shift. In total, 9 experiments were successful. The three-dimensional analysis of the successful experiments is ongoing (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>			</div>
