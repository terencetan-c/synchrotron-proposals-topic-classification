<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The dynamic structure factors of two glass former: o-terphenyl and glycerol have been measured at different temperatures r and momentum exchanged 0 using inelastic x-ray scattering with very high resolving power.</p><p>We have found propagating excitations in both liquid and glass phases as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for glycerol. This result shows that the dynamics at high firequency is the continuation of the acoustic branch detected with ultrasounds and BriUouin tighht scattering techniques.</p><p>The measured excitation energy at fixed exchanged momentum shows a cusp like behavior at a temperature inferred to be higher than the macroscopic structural arrest temperature r, (usually called the calorimetric glass transition temperature). In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> is reported such a result for the two samples. The indicated temperature L is the temperature at which we observe a change in slope of the sidebands peak position. This result suggest that the structural arrest take place at the molecular scale at temperatures higher than for macroscopic diffusion.</p><p>Using the Q + 0 limit of few dispersion curves we have developed a scheme to extract the infinite kequency speed of sound velocity C,(T) for glycerol. The derived values of C,(T) are in disagreement with previous determinations obtained by extrapolating low frequency data. In Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>are reported measurements of the speed of sound performed by Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). Two low frequency extrapolation of the infinite fkequency speed of sound are also reponed in the figure (EXTRl and EXTR?). The results shown have been subject of three different papers [I ,&amp;3].
