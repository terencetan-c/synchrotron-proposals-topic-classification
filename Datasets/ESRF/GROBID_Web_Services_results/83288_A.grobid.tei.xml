The material was interpreted as pyrite-structured ferrous iron peroxide. Nowadays it attracts great attention of scientific community because it may have drastic effect on chemistry of Fe-O system at high pressure, chemical processes in the Earth's mantle and core-mantle boundary, oxygen fugacity in deep interiors, past and present of oxygen and hydrogen cycles, and even on our understanding of life appearance and evolution on our planet (</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The chemical nature of FeO2 is yet to be clarified. Indeed, theory considers different possible forms of the compound, from dioxide (no direct chemical bonds between O 2-oxygens) to peroxide (covalent bonds between oxygen atoms forming O2 2- anions) <ref type="bibr">(Streltsov et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Garcia-Sosa &amp; Castro, 2000)</ref>. For peroxides (in molecular or crystalline forms) the distances between closest oxygen atoms at ambient pressure are very characteristic and vary from about 1.2 to 1.5 Å <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2008)</ref>, while with the compression such distances are not expected to increase. The shortest O…O contact for pyrite-type FeO2 was reported to be ~1.9 Å <ref type="bibr">(Hu et al., 2016)</ref>. It is too long for peroxides, but too short for cubic dioxides with high-pressure PdF2-type structure (HP-PdF2). For the latter the shortest O-O distance is 2.5 Å at ambient conditions, while all distances are characterized by low compressibility (see for details <ref type="bibr">(Haines &amp; Léger, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Haines et al., 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">Haines et al., , 1997;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tse et al., 2000)</ref>). In fact, osmium and ruthenium, iron's neighbors in VIIIb group in periodic table, form typical dioxides OsO2 and RuO2 with HP-PdF2type structure <ref type="bibr">(Haines et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shirako et al., 2014)</ref>. According to well-established "rule of a thumb" compounds (particularly oxides) of an element behave at high-pressure like compounds of the elements located below in the same group of periodic table at lower pressures. Thus, one could expect that FeO2 would also form dioxide, not peroxide.</p><p>In the present experiment at ID27 we demonstrated that upon heating of pure iron in oxygen at pressures of about 55 GPa and 1200 K reaction products indeed contain cubic FeO2 phase. However, refinement of crystal structure based on singlecrystal XRD data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) unambiguously shows that FeO2 crystallizes in HP-PdF2-type structure and thus iron has formal oxidation state +4. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
