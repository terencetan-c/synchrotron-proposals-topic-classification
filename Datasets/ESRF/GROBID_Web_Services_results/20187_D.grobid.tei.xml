Fresh protein was also brought with the intention of producing new crystals.</p><p>Diffraction of crystals with the in-house source has proven unsucsessful therefore crystals had to be screened for diffraction quality at Grenoble. Despite a large number of crystals (both prefrozen and frozen on site) none diffracted beyond 3.2Å (which coresponds to the best resolution dataset achived todate). Fresh crystals grown onsite overnight also failed to give improved resolution. Attempts to improve resolution by alteration of freezing conditions also proved unsucsessful.</p><p>RT dataset 1: resolution: 3.4 Å space group: P4 cell: 140 140 153 90 90 90 no. of frames collected: 5 mosaicity: 0.9, collection stopped due to radiation damage RT dataset 2: resolution: 3.2 Å space group: P4 cell: 140 140 151 90 90 90 no. frames collected: 3 mosaicity: 0.8, collection stopped due to radiation damage frozen dataset 1: resolution: 3.6 Å space group: cell: 140 140 150 90 90 90 no. of frames collected: 10 mosaicity: 0.6, collection stopped as processing revealed poor resolution frozen dataset 2: resolution: 3.4 Å space group: P4 cell: 140 140 151 90 90 90 no. of frames collected: 15 mosaicity: 1.1, collection stopped as processing revealed poor resolution and high mosaicity</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WblD</head><p>Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping cough. Although the vaccine of killed bacteria is effective there are well known severe side effects which can occur in a small number of infants. Parents have always been concerned about having their children vaccinated against whooping cough for this reason. Carbohydrate based vaccines, such as those H. Influenzae B (HIB) and N. meningitis C (MENC) have excellent safety and efficacy. A carbohydrate based vaccine for whooping cough has been developed and tested, whilst very safe its efficacy has been called into question. The efficacy could be improved by adding further components, in particular the outer carbohydrate of the LPS molecule. We have shown that the functional assignment of the gene sequence for the outer part of the LPS molecule of B. pertussis is wrong. As a result the biosynthetic pathway is incorrect. To determine the biosynthetic pathway we have crystallised the wblD enzyme. Using the MAD structure determination we performed using BM14 UK , we molecular replaced the native data. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Preliminary data (refinement in progress)</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Native</cell></row><row><cell>Wavelength</cell><cell>0.933</cell></row><row><cell>Cell constants</cell><cell>a = 77.73Å b = 89.86Å c = 123.25Å</cell></row><row><cell>Space group</cell><cell>P212121</cell></row><row><cell>Resolution</cell><cell>62 -1.6</cell></row><row><cell>Total</cell><cell>1907354</cell></row><row><cell>measurements</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Unique reflection</cell><cell>135118</cell></row><row><cell>Completeness</cell><cell>96.2</cell></row><row><cell>Rmerge</cell><cell>12.4</cell></row><row><cell>R-factor</cell><cell>24.6</cell></row><row><cell>R-free</cell><cell>26.9</cell></row><row><cell>RMSD bond</cell><cell>0.018</cell></row><row><cell>RMSD Angle</cell><cell>1.86</cell></row></table></figure>
