<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Depleted oil reservoirs are considered a viable solution to the global challenge of CO2 storage. A key concern is whether the wells can be suitably sealed with cement to hinder the escape of CO2. Under reservoir conditions, CO2 is in its supercritical state, and the high pressures and temperatures involved make real-time microscopic observations of cement degradation experimentally challenging. Here, we present an in situ 3D dynamic X-ray micro computed tomography (μ-CT) study of well cement carbonation at realistic reservoir stress, pore-pressure, and temperature conditions. The high-resolution time-lapse 3D images allow monitoring the progress of reaction fronts in Portland cement, including density changes, sample deformation, and mineral precipitation and dissolution. By switching between flow and nonflow conditions of CO2-saturated water through cement, we were able to delineate regimes dominated by calcium carbonate precipitation and dissolution. For the first time, we demonstrate experimentally the impact of the flow history on CO2 leakage risk for cement plugging. In-situ μ-CT experiments combined with geochemical modeling provide unique insight into the interactions between CO2 and cement, potentially helping in assessing the risks of CO2 storage in geological reservoirs.(Abstract) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> The X-ray measurements were done ID19 beamline, using a high photon energy of 84 keV to enable the X-ray radiation to be transmitted through the titanium walls of the deformation apparatus. The sample-detector distance was 1200 mm, giving edge-enhanced phase contrast. (37) 2D projections were obtained with a PCO Dimax detector with a pixel size of 6.45 μm and an exposure time of 0.05 s. For each time step, a full μ-CT data set consisting of 2000 radiographs (projections) over 180° were acquired. In total, 103 time-steps (full tomograms) were recorded over a period of nearly 20 h. The data were reconstructed using PyHST2 involving filtered back-projection coupled with the phase contrast algorithm. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> This study presents unprecedented time-lapse 3D imaging of the progressive degradation of Portland cement and the concomitant precipitation and dissolution of CaCO3 in leakage pathways with exposure to sc-CO2. Importantly, the data was obtained in situ, showing the response to carbonated water at controlled flow rates under realistic reservoir conditions of high pressure and temperature. The alternated application of stagnant and flow-through conditions during the experiment aided delineation of precipitation versus dissolutiondominated regimes: information that can only be achieved through in situ laboratory experiments and potentially can be used for solving imminent environmental challenges related to CO2 storage. The methodology of increasingly realistic in situ imaging experiments combined with advanced modeling is destined to find many applications in the environmental and material sciences in the coming years. In this study, experiments and geochemical modeling confirm that conditions with small CO2 flow rates promote the formation of the carbonated zone and subsequently precipitation of CaCO3 in large cavities.

The users are thankful to ESRF for providing beamtime and support and also plan to apply for more beamtimes with high hope of acceptance based on the these results.  Figure 1.
