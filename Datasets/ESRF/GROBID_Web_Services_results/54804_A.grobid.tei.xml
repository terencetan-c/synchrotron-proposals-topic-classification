<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID26</head><p>Date of experiment: from: 29.10. 2014 to: 04.11. 2014</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental. The aim of the experiment was to study the local structure of Au in synthetic Cu sulfidesanalogues of natural minerals. Four experimental series were performed:</p><p>1)</p><p>The Au L 3 and L 2 High energy fluorescence detection (HERFD) and Total fluorescence yield (TFY) XAFS spectra were recorded at ambient temperature for all compounds in the systems Ag-Au-S, Ag-Au-Te, Ag-Au-Se, Au-Sb, and Au-Pb. The spectra of these phases are used as standards for interpretation of the HERFD XAFS spectra of 'invisible' (submicroscopic) Au in sulfides, and to determine the Au 5d unoccupied density of states as a function of the composition of sulfide.</p><p>2)</p><p>The Au L 3 HREFD XAFS spectra were recorded for samples of hydrothermal Covellite (CuS) containing from 300 to 3000 ppm (0.03 -0.3 Wt. %) of Au in 'invisible' state, and for 2 types of Pyrites (FeS): high temperature well crystallized, obtained with salt-flux technique at 540 °C, and several samples of hydrothermal fine-grained aggregates of Pyrite, synthesized at different f(O 2 )-f(S 2 ) conditions at 450 °C, 1 kbar (concentration of Au falls within 20-100 ppm for all the samples). In order to determine the effect of composition and crystalline structure of sulfide mineral on the chemical state of gold, the Au L 3 spectra were also recorded for several samples of synthetic Au-bearing Sphalerites (Zn,Fe)S and Arsenopyrites FeAsS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3)</head><p>Heating experiments were performed with samples of Au-bearing Digenite (Cu 1.72 S+1.5 Wt.% Au), Covellite (CuS + 0.25 Wt.% Au), Intermediate solid solution (ISS, Cu 1.65 Fe 0.69 Au 0.06 S 2.60 ), and pyrite (FeS 2 , 36 ppm of Au). Powdered samples were hermetically sealed in the silica glass capillaries (Polymicro Technologies), and heated with the aid of electrical furnace available at ESRF. This simple experimental technique was developed for Raman spectroscopic studies of solids and liquids <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chou et al., 2008)</ref>, but for synchrotron experiment we used it for the first time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4)</head><p>The Cu K HREFD XAS and K 2,5 XES spectra were recorded for samples of synthetic covellites, digenites, and standards including Cu oxides, chloride and oxalate with different oxidation degree of Cu.</p><p>Results. It was shown that the Au L 3 spectra for the «invisible» gold in Covellite CuS, hydrothermal Pyrite FeS 2 , Arsenopyrite FeAsS, and Sphalerite (Zn,Fe)S differ from those of metallic Au and Au 2 S, as well as from the spectra of other Au and Au-Ag chalchogenides used as references (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Moreover, position and intensity of main features depend upon the sulfide composition. The white line (WL) intensity increases in the order CuS-(Zn,Fe)S-FeS 2 -FeAsS corresponding to the increase of the 5d unoccupied density of states at the Au site. The chemical state of Au in Pyrite depends on the formation conditions (or the synthesis method): fine-grained hydrothermal pyrite contains chemically bound Au due to the presence of domains of Au-bearing Tochillinite (Fe 4 S 5 with layered structure, presence of these mineral domains enriched in Au is confirmed by FEFF calculations), whereas well crystallized large grains of pyrite contain metallic Au. Heating experiments further revealed difference in the chemical state of Au (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, 3): heating of Pyrite resulted in segregation of metallic Au even in the presence of S (l) (probably due to disappearance of Tochillinite which is not stable at high temperature), whereas for Cu and Cu-Fe sulfides increase of temperature promoted the formation of Au-bearing solid solution. The experimental data reduction is now in progress.  E, eV Absorbance (arb.u.)
