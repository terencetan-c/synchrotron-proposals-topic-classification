<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples measured</head><p>The samples measured were pure fats (PO, AMF, HPKS) or suspensions consisting of these fats and various food related particles (concentrations varying between 10-60%). Additionally, sucrose esters were added as emulsifiers.</p><p>Research subject Within the Food Structure &amp; Function Research Group of Ghent University, the study of fats, and their polymorphic behaviour is a main research activity. Different X-ray scattering techniques can be used to elucidate the fat crystal network (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; left shows build-up of fat crystal network; right shows different X-ray scattering length scales and their use for elucidation of fat crystal network). Recently, a Xenocs Xeuss 3.0 was acquired via Hercules funding (Reference number AUGE/17/29). The main use of this equipment is to enable fast detection of fat polymorphs in food. One of the more advanced uses of SAXS is to obtain the crystal nanoplatelet (CNP) thickness from the peak shape. However, for lab scale equipment, the peak shape is prone to peak broadening, which affects the results obtained for CNP thickness. Adaptations to the set-up described in the proposal Samples were measured in two ways. Some adaptations to the original set-up were made, as the beamline does not have a lot of temperature controlled options.</p><p>A first set of samples was crystallized at a temperature of 0, 20 or 25°C. No thermostatic cabinets are available at BM26, therefore the PSCM lab was used. This is a serious drawback, as the temperature at the beamline is rather high and small samples do melt easily, which changes the polymorphic profile. The use of Kapton sheets to measure pre-crystallized samples allows to make efficient use precious beamtime.</p><p>The second set of samples was heated and cooled to 20°C in a capillary holder at the beamline. As such, crystallization during cooling (1 or 20°C/min) could be followed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental problems</head><p>We were able to execute most of the planned experiments, although some breakdowns in the beamline intensity were faced (including failure of the vacuum gauge that switched off the full synchrotron). The fact that data cannot be visualized as I(q), and only as 2D image, makes it difficult to judge the quality of results on the spot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p>Thanks to the experimental time at beamline BM26, peak broadening of the Xeuss equipment could clearly be investigated. Peak broadening was found to be twofold: on one hand, due to lab-scale equipment optics and on the other hand due to the composition/crystallite size of the materials used. Other research findings are kept confidential not to compromise on any publications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publications</head><p>Submission of a publication from the data obtained during experimental session BM26 is expected, however, data must be put together with other experimental data from own laboratory (DSC, PLM, NMR, rheology…). Outcome expected end 2022.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional remarks</head><p>The research team would like to thank mr. Martin Rosenthal for the help provided during the research stay, especially since we were there 4 days of which 3 were weekend/holidays.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: different X-ray scattering length scales and their use to elucidate the fat crystal network</figDesc><graphic coords="3,285.50,85.15,272.64,161.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
