<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Measurement were made on the high energy beamline ID15-A using an incident photon energy of 130 keV. Oxygen precipitated silicon crystals were used for monochromator and analyser set using the (113) reflection. The sample of single crystal La 2-x Sr x NiO 4 (x = 0.333) was mounted in a closed cycle He refrigerator mounted on the Eulerian cradle on the 4-circle triple axis diffractometer available on ID15A. The sample was mounted with the &lt;101&gt; axis surface normal. After completing the alignment process the sample was cooled to the base temperature of the cryostat and superlattice reflections were located at a modulation wavevector of (2ε, 0, 1) surrounding Bragg reflection. Having located such reflections, their wavevector (position), inverse correlation length (width) and integrated intensity was measured as a function of temperature upon warming the sample. The temperature was controlled to a stability of ± 0.05K. The peaks were measured by scanning in the three principal directions in reciprocal space, H, K and L and along the 2θ direction which can be approximated to the Q Z direction for such high energies. The latter has the advantage that only the analyser crystal has to be moved greatly reducing the instrument movement dead allowing for a fast measurement of the lattice spacing.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows measurements of the calculated correlation lengths of the charge stripe superlattice reflections, measured along the H-and L-directions. The difference of approximately a factor of two suggests that the charge stripes are 2-dimensional in nature, in agreement with our previous published work. The charge stripes are well correlated within the a-b plane of the crystal but show weaker correlations along the long c-axis. In addition an increase in the correlation length can be seen at approximately 130 K, corresponding to the spin stripe ordering temperature. This suggests that when the spin stripes coexist with the charge stripes the correlation of the charge stripes is reduced. Shown on the right of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is a comparison along the H-direction of the instrumental resolution (measured on the corresponding Bragg peak) and the charge stripe superlattice reflection. In addition scan taken in the temperature range T C -10K to T C displayed two length scales with an addition of a broader component slightly displaced from the main peak position. This indicates that just before melting the charge stripes are correlated over a shorter distance due to increasing vibration disorder of the stripes as suggested theoretically by Kivelson and Emery. 5 . 0 5 . 1 5 . 2 5 . 3 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Normalised Intensity [abr] 2θ [deg] 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 Normalised Intensity [abr] 2θ [deg] Figure 2 : Scans taken along the 2 Theta direction</p><p>This work is being prepared for publication in an internationally recognised, refereed, high impact journal.
