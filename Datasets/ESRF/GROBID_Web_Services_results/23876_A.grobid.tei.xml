<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Analysis of the interaction of water molecules with the calcite growth face (001) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We investigated the (104) calcite cleavage surface of calcite under dry and humid conditions with GIXRD techniques at beamline ID03 at the ESRF. We measured for the first time CTRs of the freshly cleaved calcite (104) face under dry and humid N2 gas (r.h. about 80 %), as well as the specular rod (00L) under both conditions. The measurement of the originally proposed (001) surface of calcite was impossible to perform, because of the roughness of the (001) surfaces of our few natural geological samples was to high for surface diffraction measurements. The (001) surface expressed in the morphology of some geological calcites turned out to be a pseudo-face, consisting mostly of steps of monolayer height and with a high step-density. So we were forced to concentrate in our experiment on the (104) calcite surface, which is obtained by cleavage and therefore these surfaces are almost step-free with wide flat terraces with a roughness of about 2.8 A (from reflectivity experiments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The experiment was carried out at the surface diffraction beamline ID03 at the ESRF. The incident X-ray beam, generated by an undulator, was monochromatized with a sagitally focusing Si(111) crystal monochromator and set to an energy of 17.2 keV (0.7205 A wavelength). An optical-quality calcite single crystal was freshly cleaved in air into pieces of about 11 mm x 9 mm x 4 mm in size. A sample without optically visible steps and defects was selected and mounted in a PET chamber with 2 capton windows coupled to a six-circle diffractometer. The measurements of the CTRs were performed in vertical scattering geometry. The incoming beam was vertically focused to about 1 mm and horizontally defined by slits to about 0.1 mm at the sample position. The incidence angle between the horizontally mounted sample surface and the X-ray beam was selected to 0.3°, close to the critical angle of calcite. The scattered beam was defined by a pair of slits in front of the detector set to 2 mm x 2 mm along the surface normal (vertical) and surface plane (horizontal), respectively.</p><p>The integrated intensity of a given reflection was obtained by orienting the sample and detector to the respective diffraction condition and then collecting the detector signal in a rocking scan around the surface normal at both sides of the diffraction maximum. The intensity profiles were corrected for polarization, Lorentz-and experimental factors, fitted with a Lorentzian function and integrated after subtracting a linear background.</p><p>The analysis of the CTR data was carried out with the software ROD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We used the orthorhombic calcite unit cell, with cell parameters a 1 = 8.095 A, a 2 = 4.990 A und a 3 = 24.2864 A * , to model the bulk and the surface atom positions. Accordingly the (104) face of the hexagonal system equals the (001) face of the orthorhomic unit cell. The orthorhombic cell has the space group pg with a glide plane symmetry along a 1direction. The used surface cell consists of 8 layers of atoms (in z-direction), with 2 calcium and 2 carbonate groups, respectively. Refined parameters are the positions, site occupation factors (sofs) and Debye-Waller factors (DWF) of the atoms in the surface cell.</p><p>* unit cell parameters obtained from transformation of the hexagonal to the orthorhombic system</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calcite surface structure under dry conditions</head><p>The analysis of the CTRs of the calcite (104) surface under dry conditions yielded a bulk terminated surface structure with a relaxation of the topmost 3 layers of atoms in the surface cell. No surface reconstructions were detected for this surface under dry or humid conditions. The bulk and refined atom positions of the calcite surface cell are shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>.  The analysis show a relaxation of the atoms in the first 3 layers of the surface cell. The protruding oxygen atoms of the topmost carbonate groups are shifted of -0.77 A in z-direction. The carbonate groups of the 1 st and 2 nd layer are distorted in a convex manner. The carbon atoms are shifted upwards in z-direction of about 0.34 A and 0.39 A in the 1 st and 2 nd layer, respectively. The movement of the calcium atoms is relatively small, the Ca´s of the topmost layer are moved downwards in z-direction of -0.16 A and upwards in the 2 nd layer of 0.10A. These results agree in general with results of atomistic simulations of the relaxation in the anhydrous (104) calcite surface published by Wright et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, we do not observe a concav distortion of the 2 nd layer carbonate groups and the shift of the calcium atoms obtained from our experiment is about a factor 5 smaller than the Ca-movement predicted in the simulation.</p><p>The probability of creating vacancies on the terraces in the cleavage process was also checked by refining the occupancy factors of the two topmost surface layers. The refinement of these parameters resulted in an occupation of 36% for all atoms in the 1 st layer and 64% occupation for all atoms in the 2 nd layer.
