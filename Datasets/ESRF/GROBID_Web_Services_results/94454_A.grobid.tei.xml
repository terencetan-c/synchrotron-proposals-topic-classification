<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Coherent X-Ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) was performed on calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles to study effect of temperature, concentration and time on crystalline phases and morphology of chemically precipitated micro-particles. In the original proposal the model system to study was identified as calcium phosphate. The choice of calcium carbonate was based on in-house experiments on crystallisation which allowed us to optimise the experimental condition e.g., temperature and concentration, to produce particles with 2-5µm diameter. For precipitation of calcium phosphate, it was not possible to obtain reproducible particles of the above-mentioned sizes which are necessary for the ID10 setup at ESRF. The long-term goal of the project is to understand the mechanism of biomineralization and establish CXDI as a powerful methodology to study such phenomenon. CaCO3 is one of the most abundant natural minerals besides being presence in skeletons / shells of several organisms. Hence the choice of CaCO3 was relevant for the project. The experiments were done as part of the ICONIC project (funded by the Research Council of Norway) which is coordinated by NTNU, Norway and ESRF is a central partner.</p><p>The CaCO3 microparticles were prepared in house at NTNU by mixing 0.05l 10 mM CaCl2 with 0.5l of 2 mM Na2CO3 containing 50mM NaCl bringing the total solution volume up to 0.55l. The process was repeated for 3 different temperatures 25º, 35º and 45º C. The reactants were under constant stirring at 700 rpm for 5 minutes and then the reaction was stopped by pouring the solution into vacuum filter with a 0.22 µm Millipore membrane. The particles on the filter were washed with ethanol to get rid of any ions residue ions and wetting solution left around and were dried at 40 o C for 24 hours to halt any further change in particles after the reaction. The whole procedure was identically repeated for all 3 temperatures. CaCO3 microparticles were removed from the solution during different times of the experiments, 2, 5 and 30 minutes, and under different conditions of supersaturations. So, we had a series of samples as a function of temperature, time and supersaturation. The particles were then mounted on Si3N4 membranes to be studied with CXDI.</p><p>The experimental setup at ID10C beamline of ESRF allows measurement of wide-angle diffraction (WAXD) together with CXDI. A highly coherent and monochromatic beam of intensity 7.6e +11 ph/s and energy 7.24 keV was used to illuminate sample with a pencil shaped well collimated beam from the new first of a kind, high energy, and low emittance Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS). The beam size at FWHM was selected to be 10x10 um using rollerblade slits. forward scattering patterns from the sample were collected on a two-dimensional detector Eiger-4M which is a Hybrid Photon Counting detector with a pixel size of 75µm square with a total pixel array format of 2070 x 2167 pixels. Sample to detector distance in the measurements was kept at 7.15m, which, coupled with the 75µm detector pixel size can give a theoretical real space reconstruction down to 16 x 16 x 16 nm of voxel size. The measurements were taken by mounting a subject particle on Si3N4 membranes fixed on goniometer which rotated in angle w roughly from -80º to +80º. The increment in measurement angle was constant of 0.2 degrees each time with an exposure of 2 to 3 seconds with one background measurement each time and an auto alignment every 40 to 50 steps. WAXD data were collected on a 1D Mythen detector mounted next to the sample simultaneously with the CXDI measurements. LaB6 powder with its well-known brag peak locations, was used to calibrate the Mythen detector. The geometry of the setup allowed us to measure 0.75A -1 to 3.39A -1 of q range in WAXD measurements.</p><p>During the beamtime, there were in total 21 measurements. WAXD collected in tandem with the CXDI measurements allowed us to identify the crystal form of CaCO3 present in the microparticles. Note that this experiment was one of the first CXDI measurements done after the EBS upgrade. We encountered change in morphology of the microparticles due to the high flux of the EBS. The observed change is demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. More measurements were done with the other fabricated microparticles while ensuring that the dose is limited to avoid any sample damage. The exposure time and steps were adapted accordingly. Given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>   Another interesting set of studies carried out during the beamtime is controlled growth over vaterite seed particles under constant supersaturation as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The seed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>) and seeded growth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) particles show two very different growth patterns and morphology. The seeded particle in ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>) shows a porous growth pattern and has a very rough surface without any obvious preference on growth direction. The growth particle in (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) however shows an obvious preferred orientation along one axis and all the growth plates appear to be well oriented along vertical axis. Furthermore, growth particle in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref> is no more porous while the seed is well preserved inside without undergoing any crystal dissolution and recrystallization. From the WAXD data it is ascertained that both particles are pure vaterite. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

In sample 2, we can visually appreciate the presence of both vaterite, and aragonite based on their grey values.
