<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Despite over ten years of research into the lowcost electrowinning of titanium direct from the oxide, the reduction sequence of TiO2-V2 O5-Al2O3 pellets in molten CaCl2 has been the subject of debate,particularly as the reduction pathway has been inferred from ex-situ studies.</p><p>Here, for the first time white beam synchrotron X-ray diffraction is used to characterize the phases that form, in-situ during reduction and with ∼100 µm spatial resolution. It is found that TiO2-V2O5-Al2O3 becomes substoichiometric very early in reduction facilitating the ionic conduction of oxygen ions, that CaTiO3 persists to nearly the end of the process and that, finally, CaO forms just before completion of the process. The method is quite generally applicable to the in-situ study of industrial chemical processes. Implications for the industrial scale-up of this method for the low-cost production of titanium are drawn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Precursors were formed using reagent-grade TiO2, V2O5 and Al2O3 (99.5% Alfa Aesar), ball milled with ethanol and zirconia spheres for 24 h. The slurry was dried and the powder ground in a mortar and pestle with a small quantity of dis-tilled water, which acted as a binding agent. 0.4 g of pow-der was uniaxially compacted at 100 MPa in a 13 mm diameter die. The precursors were then drilled to accept the commercial-purity (CP) Ti current collector and sin-tered in Ar (BOC pureshield -150 mL min1 at 1373 K for 3 h at a rate of 3 K min 1. The pellets were then ground to approximately 7mm and 0.2 g. The electrochemical cell was designed to minimize atten-uation of the white X-ray beam and avoid additional sources of diffraction. Reductions were performed in a resistance furnace-heated quartz glass vessel (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), as in Ref. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Openings were incorporated into the furnace for the synchrotron X-ray beam. A glassy C crucible was used to contain the salt and act as a consumable anode. CaCl2 granules (Fluka) were dried and prepared [11] within the C crucibles, which were then vacuum sealed prior to use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Aparatus</head><p>The sintered mixed oxide precursor precursor was attached to the Ti current collector and suspended above the salt prior to pre-electrolysis. The apparatus was heated at a rate of1 K min1 under Ar (BOC pureshield -50 mL min1)to the electrolysis temperature (1173 K).</p><p>The electrolyte was then thermally equilibrated for 3 h. Prior to experiments the salt was preelectrolysed for 1-3 h to remove electroac-tive impurities by polarizing a grade 2 CP-Ti rod (3 mm) vs. the graphite crucible. Following the pre-electrolysis, the precursor was lowered into the molten salt and polar-ized at a rate of 0.5 mV s1 from open circuit to 3100 mV vs. the C anode. The ID15A beamline at the ESRF was used to produce an unmonochromated (white) X-ray beam in energy dis-persive mode. A 50 lm  100 lm incident beam and 5 scattering angle were defined by slits yielding a gauge length of 1000 lm(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The assembly was mounted on a translation stage, allowing nine locations at different heights in the pellet to be studied. Acquisition times were 60 s per pattern. The diffraction patterns were analysed by Rietveld refinement using GSAS <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, allowing phases to be identi-fied and atomic fractions obtained. The source spectrum was normalized using both an Al powder and the powder TiO2 pattern obtained from the pellet prior to insertion into the cell. Beam hardening within the cell was accounted for by comparison with the initial patterns obtained from the pellet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Status</head><p>The analysis of the data is currently being academically reviewed, by the authors, with intention to submit the completed paper to Electrochemica Acta in the upcoming weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Highlights</head><p>Molar fractions of phases present during reduction of TiO2. Measuring the evolution of phases during reduction is of critical importance for both fundamental studies and scale-up issues. Two key points are mentioned in regard to Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Early beta Ti formation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">!"# $!"# %!"# &amp;!"# '!"# (!"# )!"# *!"# +!"# ,!"# $!!"# !# !-%(# !-(# !-*(# $# $-%(# $-(# $-*(# %# %-%(# %-(# %-*(# &amp;# &amp;-%(# &amp;-(# &amp;</formula><p>The formation of beta Ti was expected to occur at the end of reduction as prediected by the Ti-O phase diagram. However the molar fraction charts shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, clearly show that this phase forms much earlier on. This is due to the reduction of V2O5 early on which stabilise the cubic form if Ti.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formation of Ti3Al</head><p>This is the first study where this phase has been identified in the reduction of TiO2-V2O5-Al2O3 mixed oxides. More so it appears to be one of the more dominant phases during reduction. This clearly has bearing on the reduction behaviour of the mixed oxide and the size and chemical composition of the alloy graisn post reduction. The presence of this phase also has context in the homogenisation of the alloy with respect to vanadium and aluminium content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Al2O3 stability.</head><p>Alumina was found to be much more stable then TiO2 and infact only reduced once all TiO2 has been converted. In additioon the reduction of this phase gives rise to the Ti3Al phase mentioned earlier. More homogenous distrabution of Al2O3 in the mixed oxide preforms may improve the reduction kinetics and final homogenity of the alloy by minimiseing the formation of Ti3Al.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Characterisation of the Production of Ti-6Al-4V via the FFC Process Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): R.
