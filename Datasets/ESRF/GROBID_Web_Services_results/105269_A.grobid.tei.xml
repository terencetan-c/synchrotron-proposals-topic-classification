<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experimental set-up was the usual set-up for FTH at ID32. A big effort had been done by the beamline staff to improve the stability of the beamline and to reduce deadtimes in the acquisition chain (which was larger than the counting time). The 50-µm pinhole defining the incident beam was replaced by a 20-µm pinhole (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), in order to reduce the footprint on the sample, preventing from illuminating parasitic holes in the holographic mask. We benefited therefore from an optimised set-up, allowing to make images of excellent quality (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In addition, we could test an acquisition procedure to record the low-q data, usually hidden by the beamstop. Most of the data were acquired with beamstop, as the low-q data did not improve massively the quality of the images for this particular sample. We tuned the X-ray energy to the L3 edge of Fe (the magnetic layer of the sample is in Permalloy). The magnetic constrast is obtained by differentiating images taken with opposite helicities of circular polarisation. The sample was kept perpendicular to the incident beam througout the experiment, such that the magnetic contrast encodes the projection of the magnetic moments perpendicular to the sample plane. Magnetic field was applied in situ with the electromagnet of the FTH chamber, providing field along the beam propagation axis.  The sample was found initially in the same magnetic state as we left it at the end of the previous beamtime, with 5 segments of alternating polarity (including the core) seen in the domain wall (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). By applying several sequences of magnetic fields up to 0.45 T, we could understand in details the formation of the segments in the domain wall. The initial state with 5 segments was found to be very reproducible upon demagnetising the sample with alternating decreasing magnetic field. Starting from the 5-segment state, when an increasing magnetic field is applied parallel (as opposed to antiparallel) to the magnetisation of the core (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), the initial segments of the domain wall are only distorted, up to ~0.22 T. Then the outer most segment of opposite magnetisation to the applied field is switched. This intermediate state persists until the field reaches ~0.25 T and the domain wall becomes monopolar. The monopolar state is stable upon releasing the applied field (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). With an opposite field of -0.28 T (but probably lower as did not record intermediate stages), the polarity of most of the domain wall, except the core, is switched and this state is stable upon releasing the field (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).  Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Monopolar domain wall under applied field (left) and after releasing the field (right). In the first case, the entire teardrop shows some contrast because the applied field pulls the magnetisation out of plane.</p><p>We also measured a demagnetisation loop with alternating and decreasing field, with small field steps at the transitions from 1 to 3 and from 3 to 5 segments. During our exploration with magnetic field history, we found several other states, such as 2 segments and 4 segments. We are know working on micromagnetic simulations to try to reproduce these experimental results. The preliminary calculations suggest that a sizable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is necessary to stabilise the multi-segment states. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SEM image of the teardrop sample, seen from the back side through the aperture in the FTH mask.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,145.30,42.75,308.15,408.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>
