<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>EXAFS spectra were acquired for a selection of different arsenic-, copper-, iron-and leadcontaining minerals dissolved in either Ethaline or Reline (1:2 molar mixtures of choline chloride, with ethylene glycol or urea, respectively), or in aqueous media for comparison. Spectra of metal foils or solid salts ground and pressed with cellulose powder were used for reference purposes. In general, 4-6 scans were measured, depending on signal and sample concentration.</p><p>All samples were measured in both fluorescence and transmission mode. Data for the arsenic samples was very good to 14 Å -1 , down to a concentration of 1 mM. We have previously measured samples at the As K-edge at the DUBBLE beamline in 2010 (CH3232) and the data from the current trip is of equal or greater quality than previously. The copper samples could also be measured to 14 Å -1 , down to a concentration of 4 mM, whilst the iron samples could be measured to 12 Å -1 , with a minimum concentration of 9 mM. An artifact arising from the X-ray optics in the form of a small step in absorbance was observed in all lead spectra above 10 Å -1 , however after truncation of the data after 13450 eV, good fits to the first shell could still be obtained.</p><p>Electrodissolved samples of loellingite and arsenopyrite in Ethaline and Reline were measured at the As K-edge. Speciation changes were observed between the two solvents, but not between the minerals, indicating that the mineral composition has little effect on the solution species formed. In Reline, coordination of As directly to 5-6 urea ligands is proposed. This is supported by the presence of multiple scattering signal around 3-4 Å. In Ethaline, two peaks are observed that can be fitted to ethylene glycol chelation, whilst identification of the third peak is more complex. It is proposed that it could be multiple scattering of an octahedral complex or a binuclear complex. In both cases, the As-O bond is very short, at 1.7-1.8 Å, with csmall values for thermal disorder. Compared to a reference solution of As 2 O 3 , the coordination number is significantly larger, indicating that perhaps As(V) has been formed during sample electrodissolution.</p><p>Samples measured at the Cu K-edge tended to form Cl-complexes in Ethaline and mixed species in Reline, all with 4-coordination. The main exception to this was the copper(I) telluride mineral, which formed a pure O-donor complex in Ethaline. Metal-ligand distances were calculated to be 2.24 Å for Cu-Cl, and 1.95 Å for Cu-O. As there were no peaks in the 3-4 Å region, it is likely that O-donors could be from absorbed atmospheric moisture or OHformed during the electrolysis process.</p><p>The iron-containing samples tended towards formation of mixed Cl-/O-or pure O-donor complexes in all ionic liquids, except for FeCl 3 in Ethaline, which formed the anticipated tetrachloro complex.</p><p>The lead samples in Ethaline displayed multiple peaks, with a first-shell coordination of 2.5xO. These additional peaks could indicate a chelated species, or the presence of a multinuclear complex. The solubility of lead salts in Ethaline is very low, suggesting that the presence of very fine PbO must also be considered. In Reline, 4xCl-coordination was observed. Metal-ligand distances were calculated to be 2.7 Å for Pb-Cl, and 2.3 Å for Pb-O. These findings for lead are contary to the findings for the other metals studied, where Ethaline tends towards pure Cl-coordination, and Reline tends towards mixed or O-donor coordination. We also attempted to measure the speciation of chalcopyrite in an aqueous chloridic solution, to provide a direct comparison of speciation between DES and aqueous media. Copper tended towards forming a Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral O-donor complex, whilst iron could potentially have the presence of a small amount (1xCl max.) of Cl in the coordination sphere. This behaviour reflects the aqueous coordination chemistry of these elements.</p><p>These results have allowed us to determine how the speciation of four different metals changes when electrodissolved from different sulphide minerals. It was observed that the first coordination shell commonly contained a higher proportion of O-donors when the sample was prepared via electrolysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fourier transforms of the EXAFS data (circles) and fits (line) for As 2 O 3 20 mM in Ethaline(left), and arsenopyrite in Ethaline (middle) and Reline (right).
