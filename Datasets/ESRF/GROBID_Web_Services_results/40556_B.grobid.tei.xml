<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This has been a very successful and highly productive experiment in several aspects, as summarised below.</p><p>1) The measurements were carried out by using two liquid cells that house the samples. We designed and constructed the cells and the main body for which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. They have been used for previous measurements (at ID10B) and will be used for future related measurements, and could also be adapted to neutron reflectometry experiments. We carried out three different sets of experiments.</p><p>2) We studied the salt (NaNO 3 ) effect on the adsorption of three surfactants on mica: one hydrogenated gemini ((C12TAB) 2 -H12) and two semifluorinated gemini F-spacer surfactants ((C12TAB) 2 -H4F4H4 and (C12TAB) 2 -H3F6H3). As we increased the concentration of salt solution (20, 50, 100 and 200 mM) added to the surfactant solutions, by keeping the same surfactant concentration at 0.1 cmc, we found that the thickness and the density of the bilayer increased.</p><p>3) The second system we studied is the competitive adsorption between hydrogenated and semifluorinated single chain surfactants. We looked at three surfactants mixtures: C16TAB-F4H11(d)TAB, C16TAB-F5H10TAB and C18TAB-F8H6(d)TAB. We kept the total concentration</p></div>

We started with a composition of 100% hydrogenated surfactant and as we gradually add the semifluorinated surfactant we believe that they displace the hydrogenated surfactants as they adsorb more strongly. 4) Finally we looked at the interaction between three components: a polymer, Polyethyleneimine (PEI), a perfluorinated surfactant, Cesium Perfluorononanoate (CsPFN) and a salt, NaNO 3 The effects of varying surfactant and salt concentrations were studied in the following sequence: i) 100 ppm PEI was adsorbed on mica. ii) 50 ppm PEI in water was injected in the liquid cell. iii) A mixture of 50 ppm PEI and CsPFN was added in different steps with increasing surfactant concentrations. iv) 50 mM NaNO 3 solution was added to the mixture varying the CsPFN concentration v) CsPFN concentration was kept constant and NaNO 3 concentration varied. vi) The system was rinsed and the sequence repeated from step iv). We found a quite dramatic response of the layer structure to the change in the solution conditions. Some reflectivity curves, for this system, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Distinct Keissig fringes are evident, and both the reflectivity and the fringe spacing vary as the concentration of the surfactant increases from 0.1 cmc to 1 cmc and as the 50 mM salt solution is added to the PEI-CsPFN mixture. We also observe some Bragg peaks, either due to multilayer formation or to liquid crytal formaiton of the CsPFN surfactant below its Krafft temperature. This is an interesting observation, and we would like investigate this effect further in possible future experiments. 5) We found that our local contact, Dr Bouchenoire, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The beam alignment was non-trival due our gently curved mica surface geometry. Dr Bouchenoire was very careful and patient with us. 6) Overall, we anticipate 3 manuscripts to be submitted as a result of every single set of experiment. 7) We find the analysis of the XRR data from mica non-trivial and are in the process of seeking help from several collaborators. 10 -6 10 -5 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 Relative Reflectivity (a.u.) 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 Q = 4πsinθ/λ (Å -1 ) 100 ppm PEI in air 50 ppm PEI in H 2 O 50 ppm PEI + 0.1 cmc CsPFN 50 ppm PEI + 0.5 cmc CsPFN 50 ppm PEI + 1 cmc CsPFN PEI + 1 cmc + 50 mM NaNO 3 mica Bragg peak Fig. 2.
