<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main goal of this proposal was to gain insight on the structural details playing a significant role on the magnetic exchange bias phenomenon. The system studied consisted in Co/FeF 2 bilayers in situ deposited by electron beam evaporation on top of MgF 2 (110) single crystal substrates. The atomic structure of the system was characterized by doing surface x-ray diffraction measurements using the UHV chamber mounted on the 2+3 diffractometer available at beamline BM25B.</p><p>During the experiment, several efforts were devoted to find the optimum FeF 2 evaporation conditions. After optimizing these conditions, two differente bilayers could be prepared on top of two different MgF 2 (110) substrates. The corresponding reflectivity curves are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For the case of the thicker sample 1, the substrate preparation included ion bombardment + annealing + O 2 treatment. In the case of the thinner sample 2, ion bombardment was not applied, and just annealing and O 2 treatment were used. The growth of FeF 2 was verified by checking the changes in radial scans around several privileged directions of reciprocal space. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) shows one of these scans, around the K-direction, confirming the presence of peaks asociated with FeF 2 growth. The epitaxial character of the film was demonstrated by long azimuthal phi-scans with the presence of equivalent peaks at the expected 180º periodicity, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>. Additional deposition of ferromagnetic Co films was confirmed by the changes in reflectivity curves (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and in H-scans, as those shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>In spite of the good quality of the in-plane epitaxy, the out-of-plane measurements, consisting in the search of surface peaks at different places of reciprocal space, and in the recording of complete CTRs, (0 1 L), (0 2 L), (1 1 L) and (3 1 L), both of substrate and of FeF 2 films, had not enough signal to complete a detailed analysis of the structure. This means that further efforts are needed in order to improve the substrate surface preparation method, possibly including the use of chemical treatments. In any case, the magnetic characterization of the two sampes prepared is currently under way trying to find some correlations between the magnetic behaviour and the structural characterization carried out. 0,8 0,9 1,0 1,1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Intensity (arb. units) K (r.l.u.)
