<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the framework of experiment MA-4527 granted by ESRF for 3 shifts on beam line ID22 (started on 01 December 2020 at 08:00 and ended on 02 December at 08:00) 17 high-resolution powder patterns of 10 compounds were measured. The X-ray wavelengths used were 0.354478(1) and 0.354494(4) Å. The patterns were measured in the 2 ranges 0.0 -32 o . The Figures of all 17 patterns are shown below.</p><p>Sample ZIOC2 (chiral HOF) has been measured at elevated temperature. Eight synchrotron patterns gave us an opportunity to establish two new crystal structures -tetrahydrate and anhydrous forms of ZIOC2.</p><p>Samples GAVR47, GAVR50, GAVR51, GAV52 &amp; GAVR53 are chiral organic diamidophosphites. Patterns GAVR51 &amp; GAVR52 are indexed, the structure determination is in progress. The crystal structures of GAVR48 &amp; GAVR49, measured in September, are now solved.</p><p>Sample LA342 is ternary intermetallic with La. This sample contains three (or even more) crystalline phases, two of which are known, and the 3 rd one needs to be established. Synchrotron pattern allowed us to index the 3 rd phase now.</p><p>Sample HOF50 is HOF based on palladium porphyrinylphosphonate. Samples VERA33 &amp; VERA34 are new MOFs with La. Three latter patterns are under consideration in the search for possible unit cells (indexing).</p><p>Finally, we estimate the obtained synchrotron patterns as very informative and thank the ID22 staff for their high-quality work in this remote mail-in experiment.</p></div>
