<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the integrated Bragg peak intensity from different crystal phases during annealing of the perovskite precursor measured by GIWAXS. Before annealing (t = 0) we observe already crystallized PbI2 in the precursor film. Immediately at the start of annealing (t = 50 s) we observe a strong increase in PbI2 nucleation. This is followed by an increase of nucleation of the cubic perovskite phase. At later times (t = 100…600) we see a complete conversion of the crystalline PbI2 into the cubic perovskite structure. We also observe the nucleation of the 6H polytype of FAPbI3 in competition to the cubic perovskite structure. As stated in the proposal, we were able to measure the crystal formation dynamics for several material compositions. The crystal formation dynamics were measured in real-time during annealing by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) to determine the crystal quality, in terms of peak width and orientation distribution. The analysis of these data is still ongoing. With these in situ real-time measurements, we expect to obtain a detailed understanding of the structural aspects of perovskite crystal formation from solution in a 1-step conversion process.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent collaboration with the beamline staff, which made this challenging experiment a success.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1: Comparison of GIWAXS data at the end of film growth from two films with different cation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Compositional engineering of organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites is one of the key methods to achieve high solar cell efficiency. As stated in the proposal, we have determined different compositions of MPbX3 (M = CH3NH3 + , CH(NH2)2 + , or Cs + and X= Cl, Br, I or a mixture) with different mixing ratios for M and X.</p><p>The following X-ray scattering experiments were done at beamline ID10 of the ESRF with a photon energy of 22 keV under N2 atmosphere. The beam size was 20 µm in vertical direction and 100 µm in horizontal direction. GIWAXS data was measured under an angle of incidence of 0.02…0.2° with a PILATUS 300k area detector.</p><p>Since the analysis of the data is still in progress, we present only some important findings in this report. As an example in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> we show post growth GIWAXS data of mixed perovskite films with different cation ratio. The films are crystalline with reflections matching a single perovskite structure. Depending on mixing ratio we find a slight shift of the lattice constant of the cubic perovskite structure. The shift of the lattice constant is induced by a larger molecular cation, which expands the lattice. In addition, we find different amounts of PbI2 and hexagonal FaPbI3 polytypes. Since these two additional phases strongly impact the device performance of perovskite solar cells, we track the also the nucleation of these in real-time during annealing.</p></div>			</div>
