<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>3) Dusts recovered from the tissue after chemical digestion, and put over a cellulose mixed ester filter (as it is usually done for the airborne dust samples). In this case, the sample was put into a kapton bag to preserve it during the investigation. All samples were investigated in the Fluorescence mode, at room temperature but not in vacuum, because of the presence of biological matter into the vacuum chamber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Results</head><p>We got successful spectra of 9 artificial stone samples, which included a so called "ici white" sample, i.e. a sample with peculiarly low Fe content. In all the cases, spectra reveal, at a first consideration, a very complex Fe speciation. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these materials, only a general picture coming out from the comparison of the fits of the 3 sets of samples investigated in this experiment and those obtained on the 4 sets of samples investigated in CH3929 will allow to unravel the complex Fe speciation and to determine the presence and the amount of surface Fe sites with unsaturated coordination able to influence the adverse effects of SiO 2 . Concerning the lung tissues, we got excellent spectra (with very good signal-to-noise ratio) for the dusts and for the massive lung tissue. The spectra of the hystological sections were a little more noisy, but still clearly interpretable. Most of the spectra appear dominated by the feature of a a Fe oxide very similar to ferrihydrite (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), presumably contained in ferritin units. This behaviour is well illustrated by the Figure here below. Further studies, aimed at localising the Fe speciation with respect to the distribution of the silica particles in the hystological section, are planned. Linear combination fitting performed on a Fe XANES spectrum acquired on a histological section during a bulk XAS experiment at BM8. Good match with the experimental spectrum of the sample was obtained using a linear combination of the reference spectra of ferritin (61%) and hematite (38%). The spectra of ferritin and hematite are reported scaled by their weight in the linear combination.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,36.20,329.60,266.10,188.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims</head><p>The proposal was aimed at gaining insight on the Fe associated to crystalline silica materials in relation to its possible health effects. The proposal experimentally focussed on two different topics. Two kind of silicabearing materials have been investigated: artificial stones and autoptic lung tissues collected from subject died with silicosis. The results are expected to provide a fundamental insight in the understanding of the role played by Fe speciation, namely concerning its presence in unsaturated coordination sites and in the modulation of ROS generation during inflammation of lung cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods (1): artificial stone</head><p>Artificial stone samples brought to the experiment consisted of three different samples per commercial material (raw, dusts from industrial dry polishing, dusts from industrial wet polishing). All considered samples were investigated by XAS spectroscopy in the pre-edge, XANES and EXAFS regions, using the Fluorescence set up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods (2): XAS set up</head><p>XAS spectra have been collected at the Fe K-edge (7.112 keV) using Si(311) crystals in the monochromator, at room temperature and in vacuum, to minimise the contribution from air scattering. The Fluorescence signal was collected by a high-purity Ge solid-state detector. Calibration of the energy was obtained in situ through a metal Fe foil measured in a second chamber, at the same time of the samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods (3): lung tissues</head><p>This part of the experiment was highly exploratory, as the best conditions to register a XAS signal coming from the tissue or from the dusts contained in it were not a priori known. For this reasons, three different kind of samples were considered:</p><p>1) A human lung tissue in the form of a bulk fragment, analysed as it was;</p><p>2) An hystological section of the same tissue, put over a polycarbonate support, to minimise interference at the X-rays between the support and the sample; also this tissue was analysed as it was;</p></div>
