<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The project focuses on studies of metal hydrides based on light-weight elements. During the last few years different so-called alanates e.g. LiAlH 4 , NaAlH 4 containing up to 10 wt% hydrogen have been intensely studied. Even though these materials have been known for a long time, details about structure of the starting material and desorption products are defective. For possible applications, doping/catalysts are needed, but the effect of the catalyst/dopants on the absorption / desorption process is not understood.</p><p>The time-resolved in situ diffraction experiments aim on detailed studies of the desorption process of undoped and doped alanate samples. The following materials were investigated: All samples were mounted in 0.7 mm quartz-glass capillaries mounted in a Swagelok fitting connected to a vacuum pump. A hot air blower was used to heat the sample to maximum 400°C. Data were collected with the MAR345 image plate system. The wavelength was 0.7100 Å. Expose time was 30 sec. for every experiment (and about 1 ½ min. is needed to read out the detectors, meaning an experiment every 2. minute). Both experiments at different heating rates and at isothermal conditions were carried out. (c) KAlD 4 . KAlD 4 , has been shown to be reversible with respect to hydrogen storage <ref type="bibr">(Hiroyuki et al., 2003)</ref>, and it is therefore of great interest to determine the structures of the constituent phases of the decomposition (including KAlD 4 that we recently have found based on experiment 01-01-613 and K 3 AlD 6 that is not known) and to follow the decomposition in details. Decomposition into K 3 AlD 6 is 100% finished at 290 °C at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min. A diagram with the K 3 AlD 6 and Al phases is shown below. Structural studies of this phase will be based on this diagram in addition to forthcoming powder X-ray (including experiments at SNBL) and neutron diffraction work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(a) LiAlD 4 both pure and 4 samples with different VCl 3 and (Ti,Al)Cl 3 doping. (b) NaAlD 4 pure and doped with TiCl 4 . (c) KAlD 4 .</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Heating rates 0.5, 1 and 2 °C/min were used for studies of the 5 different samples (pure LiAlD 4 and 4 doped). In addition isothermal measurement at temperatures 128, 132, 136 and 140°C were carried out for the pure LiAlD 4 . Both series of measurements showed the twostep decomposition of LiAlD 4 into (i) Li 3 AlD 6 , Al and LiD at the first stage and (ii) decomposition of Li 3 AlD 6 into Al and LiD at the second stage. The temperatures for the evolution of the different phases were extracted from the data for the different dopants, different heating rates and as a function of time for the isothermal measurements.The figure shows the diffraction diagrams for LiAlD 4 + 2% VCl 3 . The temperature for decomposition of LiAlD 4 to Li 3 AlD 6 is reduced from 185 to 125 °C going from pure to 5 mol% VCl 3 . The analyses of the isothermal decomposition are in progress. (b) NaAlD 4 . Experiments were carried out with pure NaAlD 4 and 2,6 and 10 mol% TiCl 4 doped NaAlD 4 . The final analyses of the data are in progress. The figure shows diffraction diagrams for 2 mol% TiCl 4 doped NaAlD 4 heated from 50 to 290°C.</figDesc></figure>
