<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Abstract Material failure is determined by a suite of deformation mechanisms with differing kinetics operating together and presented an integrated response to an observer. To elucidate processes requires separating one from another in order to construct physicallybased descriptions of behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Observing a material where failure processes are controlled by a designed impulse and are at a suitable scale offers the possibility of separating operating mechanisms. A highly reproducible synchronised loading test frame has been developed by Diamond and Manchester. It was fielded at the ESRF in MA-2981 and shown to produce useful results on simple test problems (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The device was designed to investigate failure in a range of materials and a vairety of classes of material were fielded in the experiments conducted. These included experiments to study the fracture of glass and consolidation in graphite with instrumented testing and high-speed radiography. Further we were able to contrast observed behaviours with experiments on single crystal silicon wafers as well as to look at quartz plates and their fracture in comparison with soda lime glass. The fielding of the experiment and the performance of the device, have shown that the excellent data gathered on failure may be extended in future beamtime with fundamental studies on shock consolidation. We wish to compress silicate particles in order to assess the possibility that addition of quantities of ice and salts might allow particulate material to attain a solid structure after impact. This would enable us to demonstrate consolidation of dust in the early solar system into planetesimals as hypothesised in several works 2,3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Scientific context:</head><p>The process defining the end of elastic behaviour in an amorphous glass is fracture. On exceeding the strength of the material, inelastic processes start when a crack is initiated at a flaw on the loaded surface, the tip travels at a speed determined by the stress level that accelerates to the Rayleigh wave speed in the material in the limiting case with the shear wave speed increasing with pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> A regime exists in front of a driven indenter where a material can support different states (unfailed and failed) for a time dependent upon the speed at which the failure processes operate. An example is shown from a radiographic image taken at ESRF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The indenter morphology determines the deformation zone extent and the degree of compaction within that absorbs the applied strain. Further we can control indenter material and geometry. This time is a few microseconds in the case of glass and was captured using single bunch imaging at ESRF for the first time. Glass shows the evolution of unsteady stress states through localisation, failure and compaction as the material accommodates strain and transits to the steady state. In application, delayed failure is a feature of such materials, and this plays a critical role in the operation of armour and protection in key components and vital structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</p><p>Whilst it has been possible to measure stress states and wave speeds for these states using photography, it has never been previously possible to track density change and identify fracture morphology in real time. Thus we hope to field X ray and optical imaging to quantitatively define these states, observe fracture occurring in the glasses now that timing and impulse loading have been optimised, and then to extend to opaque brittle materials. We have shown capability exists to interrogate these phenomena, and we believe we now have the means to demonstrate for the first time quantitative 4D results using X ray imaging in brittle solids. Further experiments will allow us to consolidate knowledge of assumed mechanisms and advance analytical and numerical models for this class of brittle solids under load <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Further we wish to use the impactor to compress silicate grains with and without ice coatings and under vacuum to attempt to test these hypotheses using high-speed radiography and post-loading XRT to interrogate the compacted material.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental results</head><p>We have investigated a brittle and a porous material indented using different tip morphologies to build up a picture of generalized failure in these material classes. Glass plates were loaded from a linear face to drive a divergent failure front out into the target. Frames from such sequences captured during the experiments on silica materials is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> above. The impulse was accurately matched to the shutter controlling transmission of X rays through the sample and to trigger imaging cameras and assembled stress field diagnostics. In other experiments nuclear carbon and graphite tiles were impacted and mixed mode fracture and compression was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). We hope to come back to ESRF with an additional impact device that will be constructed with a more powerful driving force to increase velocity and thus force new modes of failure within the sample. After the shot microstructure was characterised off line and this process is ongoing to field experiments in a future call.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beamline(s) and beam time:</head><p>The beam conditions on ID19 proved ideal for studying the low-density glasses and silicates investigated in this experiment. Without this information the linkage between loading conditions and the failed and retrieved resulting fragments is lost. Samples were mounted on beam line rotation stages and imaged with phase contrast transmission imaging using standard beam line protocols. Tomography and imaging with ca. three micron resolution was conducted over the 6 shifts allocated but we shall look to apply for longer time allocations in future work now the technique has been proven.</p><p>The monochromatic XMT allowed us to extract microstructural changes relative to the preshocked state and shock conditions. These results identified (or allow development of) the key defect, failure and damage models appropriate to the materials tested. We have identified the needed for faster indentation (greater stress developed) to investigate and initiate these new failure modes. This will be the subject of our follow on proposal for future experiments. We will develop key protocols for future dynamic work at GHz imaging rates at ID19. The 3D mapping of phase and damage that will result will allow model construction and then stringent validation. The role of these processes remains a key area of debate in the field, and the project will yield high impact publications. We intend to use the data to support a suite of comprehensive studies for which further funding proposals are under development. With the fast imaging already conducted at ESRF, this experiment will be a tour de force coupling dynamic failure with quantitative X ray imaging to shine light upon a key unanswered problem in these fields.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 DMC impact rig.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,207.64,524.98,181.20,171.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
