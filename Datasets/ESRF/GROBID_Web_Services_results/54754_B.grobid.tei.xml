<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We performed resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the new iridate Ba 2 YIrO 6 . This compound realizes a lattice of Irsites in a 5d 4 configuration, which exhibit a nonmagnetic J=0 ground state in the free ion limit. These systems are hence expected to be nonmagnetic. It was therefore a great surprise when we observed a paramagnetic response of Ba 2 YIrO 6 . The aim of this study was to clarify the microscopic origin of this unexpected magnetic response. To this end, we used RIXS at the Ir L 3 -edge (11.217 keV) to determine the dispersion of the J=1 and J=2 excitations along various high-symmetry directions in reciprocal space. For the measurements π-polarized incoming photons were used and the scattering angle was chosen close to 2θ=90° in order to suppress the elastic scattering.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, a representative data set of measurements along the Γ-X direction is presented.</p><p>The spectra show three important features at energy losses fitting well to our theoretical model calculations, namely a J=1 triplet at ≈350 meV and a J=2 quintet at ≈650 meV. However, we also observe a feature which is not reproduced by the theoretical model at around 1.2 eV (not shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This excitation is much broader then the lower J=1,2 features and indicates a continuum of excitation. The J=1 and J=2 peaks show a downward dispersion towards the X-point, which is in accordance with our model calculations. However, the experimentally observed dispersions are by a factor of 10 smaller than those obtained by our previous model calculations. Most importantly, we do not observe any evidence of a magnetic instability due to a magnetic soft mode.</p><p>As an immediate result of this study we can therefore exclude the theoretically predicted condensation of J=1 or J=2 excitations in Ba 2 YIrO 6 .</p><p>We also discovered important selection rules that provide essential microscopic information. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the RIXS spectra at different but equivalent high-symmetry points can strongly differ. Particularly the feature assigned to the J=2 excitations in X is clearly split up into two branches, whereas in X' obviously one branch vanishes. We also performed measurements along the path X-W-K-W'-X' between these two points, to investigate the development of this effect. These selection rules contain direct information about the symmetry properties of the different quintet excitations. Currently we are in the process of comparing these results to numerical calculations on a quantitative level, taking into account the exact scattering geometry. This will enable us to extract details on the symmetry properties of the different excitations and to assign specific features in the RIXS spectra to them. In this way, these data will provide a very detailed characterization of the relevant energy scales for this magnetic system. We expect, that this will ultimately enable us to rationalize the unusual magnetic behavior of these 5d 4 -systems. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Maximilian Kusch * Laboratory IFW Institut für Festkörper-und Werkstoffforschung Dresden Tobias Ritschel Laboratory IFW Institut für Festkörper-und Werkstoffforschung Dresden Marco Moretti Laboratory ESRF Grenoble Jeroen van den Brink Laboratory IFW Institut für Festkörper-und Werkstoffforschung Dresden Jochen Geck *Laboratory IFW Institut für Festkörper-und Werkstoffforschung Dresden</figDesc></figure>
