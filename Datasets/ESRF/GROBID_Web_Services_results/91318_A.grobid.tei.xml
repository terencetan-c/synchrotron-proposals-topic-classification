<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Local contact(s): Dr. Michela Brunelli Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Daniel Hermida Merino -Dubble/ NWO Bing Wu* -Dubble/Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Report:</p><p>As one of the most used soft material, PEG-based polyacrylate material has been used in various industrial applications like biomedical coating and tissue engineering. While UV-curing, due to its simplicity and easy applicability, has been widely used in the industrial production of polyacrylate gels. One of the shortcoming of implementing this radiationinduced radical polymerization is the extensively presented micro-phase-separation in the product. Through using AFM to in-situ study the morphological heterogeneity in gels which were photo-cured from several oligomeric diacrylates, Krzeminski et al. found a rodlike 'microgel' was formed during the initial stage of the curing process. Similar microgel structure has also been observed in DSC.</p><p>In our preliminary in-house AFM study, we found a clear phase separation in 50% cured PEG-polyacrylate gel. While the NMR spin diffusion analyses on the similar sample also showed a clear phase separation in the gel with relative low curing degree. Hence, it is important to systematically probe microheterogeneity in a series UV-cured polyacrylates with an insitu analyses.. Small-angle scattering techniques are well-known for their applications in probing structural heterogeneity on the scale from 10 to 10 4 â„«. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, from the initial SAXS analyses, two domains are clearly shown in the 50% cured PEG-polyacrylate gel, and with the increasing of the curing degree, the size of the microgel domain increased. Moreover, our past preliminary synchrotron SAXS analyses on systems mixed between diacrylate and monoacrylate with different ratio, also shows a shifting in the size distribution of these microgel structure, which indicates the significant influence of monoacrylate on the formation of microgel structure.</p><p>By analysing this UV-curing procedure with synchrotron-based in-situ SAXS-WAXS, one can have a deep understanding on the effect of crosslink density and monoacrylate on the formation of microgel structure during the whole curing procedure Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows examples of this SAXS profile evolution, not all the system will form nanogel during the curing process.</p><p>For instance, SAXS profiles of PEGDA-250 shows no discernable peak appear at high q range. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. SAXS profile of PEGDA-250 and PEGDA-700 over time.. On the other hand, these profiles with distinguishable peaks can be fitted with a Gaussian function at their high q region, while the fractal dimesion also can be extracted through a simple power law fitting on their low q region. The fitted parameters for PEGDA-HA system are shown in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. It can be found the nanogel formation undergo a turning point at 30 s for all the composition ratio, and the molar number and size of these nanogels are also affected by the co-polymer portion. The addition of co-polymer into the system (in this case, hexyl acrylate) will increase the polydispersion as well as reduce the overall size of these nanogels, and the kinetic of this gelation process becomes slower.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: The fitted parameters (peak position, intergartion area, FWHM)for evolution nanogel peak over time, as well as the evolution of fractal dimension from Deybe regime of this system.</p><p>The set of experiments promotes the understand of the formation and evolution of nanogel in these acrylates system. and the manuscript is under prepartion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,34.00,131.72,534.60,163.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
