Bauer, J. Stangl,* E. Wintersberger,* J. Novak,* Institut für Halbleiter-und Festkörperphysik Johannes Kepler Universität Linz Altenbergerstr. 69 A-4040 Linz Austria Report:</p><p>We have investigated Ge/Si multilayer samples, where in each Ge layer about 6ML of Ge have been deposited, leading to the self-organized formation of SiGe islands. In contrast to previous studies on similar samples grown on flat Si(001) substrates, these multilayers have been deposited onto prepatterned Si(001) substrates: the substrates are coated with photo resist, and using holographic lithography a periodic stripe pattern with a period of about 300 nm is generated. Rotating the substrates by 90° and repeating the procedure, a twodimensional pattern is produced, which is transferred into the Si substrates. After prepatterning, the substrates are inserted into an molecular beam epitaxy system, and the surface is cleaned by a high-temperature step, which (together with the subsequent growth of a Si buffer layer) alters the surface pattern: the etched pits transform into facetted pits. The Ge islands consequently grow within these pits on facetted surfaces different from the (001) substrate surface, which changes the growth conditions. As a result, perfectly two-dimensionally ordered SiGe islands with a very narrow size distribution are produced <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Growing multilayers, the vertical stacking of islands in subsequent layers leads to three-dimensionally ordered island multilayers. The aim of our experiments is to characterize the parameters of the resulting islands, and compare the results with islands grown under identical conditions onto flat substrates. Furthermore, the statistical properties of the island ordering is investigated.</p><p>In order to obtain information on the strain distribution within the growth plane and along growth direction, reciprocal space maps around asymmetrical reciprocal lattice points have been recorded in coplanar gemoetry, i.e., with the incident and diffracted beams and the surface normal lying in a common plane. An example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1  (sample CG037</ref>). In addition to the intensity modulation along Q z , which is due to the multilayer structure, many orders of satellite maxima also along Q x are found. The latter reflect the highly perfect lateral ordering of the SiGe islands.</p><p>The Ge composition of the individual islands can in principle be obtained from the envelope of the satellite peaks. However, the scattering pattern is rather complicated, and first attempts to obtain a good fit have not been fully satisfactory. In order to obtain additional information on the Ge content, i.e., on the Si-Ge intermixing, we performed grazing incidence diffraction around the (220) inplane Bragg reflection. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the diffracted intensity for sample Z576 for a certain Q z value, i.e., a slice parallel to the sample surface through the three-simensional intensity distribution. From the lower intensity maximum, the average in-plane relaxation can be estimated. Furthermore, from the complete data set, streaks from the different facets of the grooves and the pits can be observed.</p><p>[1] Z. Zhong, A. Halilovic, T. Fromherz, F. Schäffler, G. Bauer, Appl.
