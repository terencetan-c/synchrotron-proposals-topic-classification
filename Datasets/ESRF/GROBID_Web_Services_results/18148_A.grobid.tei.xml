<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Compound (1): A structureless whole pattern profile refinement by Le Bail method (program FullProf available in the WinPLOTR software package) confirmed the monoclinic unit cell previously found, and the P2 1 /c space group. 2921 integrated intensities were extracted in the angular range 1-44° (2θ), and were used in SHELXTL for direct methods calculations. By increasing the number of direct methods attempts to 256, the most probable E-map revealed the location of the 7 independent nickel atoms with 17 surrounding oxygens and few carbons. These corresponding atomic coordinates were used as a starting model in the Rietveld refinement, which converged approximately to R B = 0.30 and R F = 0.20, confirming the validity of the initial hypothesis. Successive difference Fourier maps alternated with profile refinements in the Rietveld method allowed to complete the inorganic framework. At this stage, the use of soft distance and angular constraints, to stabilise the oxide framework, gave gradually clearer difference electron density maps and allowed to complete the organic moieties and the location of the free water molecules. At the final stage, the structural model contains 55 non-hydrogen atoms. The final fit obtained between calculated and observed patterns corresponds to satisfactory crystal structure model indicators (R B = 0.067 and R F = 0.070) and profile factors (Rp = 0.051 and Rwp = 0.063) as shown on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>The structure of (1) or Ni 7 (O 2 C-(CH 2 ) 2 -CO 2 ) 4 O 2 (OH) 2 (H 2 O) 5 .7H 2 O, can be described from hybrid organicinorganic layers in the bc plane (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). These layers are constructed from nickel oxide corrugated chains running along the b axis. These chains are built from NiO 6 hexameric units where octahedra are connected by sharing a face, edges and corners. In a chain, hexamers are connected via a seventh octahedron, which shares two edges in trans position with two neighbouring hexamers. All acidic groups are deprotonated. Half of the succinates decorates the chains, then the other half connects them along the c axis. No covalent bond links adjacent layers and the three dimensional arrangement is ensured by hydrogen bonds, directly between two adjacent layers and via free water molecules. These results will be presented at EPDIC-8 conference and will be soon published.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compound (2):</head><p>All attempts to solve the structure in the monoclinic space groups failed. A check for possible higher metrical symmetry of the lattice using the Lepage code led to a rhombohedral unit cell (a = 21.049(2), c = 45.83(1) Å and V = 17585(6)Å 3 ; S.G. R-3c). Unfortunately, Forster and Cheetham solved, at the same time, the structure of <ref type="bibr">[Forster and Cheetham Angew. Chem. Int.

Synchrotron data of (3) compared with conventional X-ray source data, clearly show a split of some lines. Unfortunately, all of them could not be indexed with satisfactory figures of merit, showing that the compound was probably not a pure phase. The structure of (4) could be solved ab initio and the final Rietveld refinement converged to very good structural model indicators (R B = 0.039 and R F = 0.044) and profile factors (R wp = 0.043 and R p = 0.035). The quality of the data is really impressing and most of Hatoms could be deduced from the last difference Fourier map.
