<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Velocity measurement in an electromagneticcaly levitated droplet</p><p>Experiment number: MA-276 Beamline: Date of experiment: from: 14-11-07 to: 15-11-07 Date of report: 01-02-08 Shifts: Local contact(s): Dr Marco DI MICHEL Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Jacqueline ETAY -CNRS-SIMAP-EPM (France) Ivan EGRY -DLR-Koln (Germany) Marco DI MICHIEL -ESRF (France) Report:</p><p>Aims of the experiment and scientific background Electrical conducting materials can be molten, held and stirred without material contact by using induction. These three effects are present in electromagnetic levitation. This processes has two principal applications : processing of materials with very high purity, such as metallic alloys or oxides, and measurement of thermophysical properties of overheated metallic alloys. In both cases, the validation of the numerical models runs up against the absence of experimental data relatives to the velocity measurements inside the levitated droplet. Until now these measurements were not possible because the medium is at a high temperature, preventing any material contact, and it is not transparent at the natural light preventing image velocimetry. By using a technique of imagery by x-rays we want to measure velocities in an aluminum droplet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-work</head><p>In order to adpat the exprimental facily to the ESRF environment a preliminary visit was done on the 2d of April 2007. Following this visit, the exprimentalist were aware of -the specificities of the beamline -the specificities of the available power -the specificities of the water supply -the geometry of the room and the respective position of the beamline</p><p>The applicants modified the facility :</p><p>-the support of the facility has been adapted -a specific power supply has been developed by a SEM (IP-partner)</p><p>-the power supply need an adpatation of the water supply -a specific remote control of the power supply has been developed -the size of the sample has been reduced</p><p>Experiments have been performed on 14 and 15th of November 2007.</p><p>First day has been mainly devoted to the arrangment of the facility (water connections, power supply connections, remote command of the power supply, gaz connections,…). A first levitation trial was performed allowoing to fix the X-ray beam. Solving the measurements acquisition was more difficult, but achieved.</p><p>Second day : 5 samples were molten in argon gaz and movies under X-Rays were registred.</p><p>After : All movies have been recover and are in the process of analysis.</p><p>Possible improvements have been stated. They consist on -modification of the chosen alloy in order ot reduce oxidation problems -modification of the making of sample (ingot shape) -increase the power supply avalable and its remote control -change the particules in order to improve the wetting of those particules by metallic alloy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERAL REMARK ON ESRF ORGANISATION</head><p>Every think has been finely arranged and ESRF staff was very efficient to help. Nevertheless, the name of the main applicant of the proposal (Jacqueline Etay) was not on Form A. Therefore, she had to wait an half hour in order to solve this problem. This was performed smoothly.</p></div>		</body>
