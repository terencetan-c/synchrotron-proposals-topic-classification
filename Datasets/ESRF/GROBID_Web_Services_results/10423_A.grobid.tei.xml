<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>XMCD experiments have been performed at the rare earth L2,3 and 3d metal K-edge on single crystals of GdNiS TbNi5 and HoCo;! ferromagnetic compounds (TC = 32 K, 23 K and 78 K in GdNi5 TbNi5 and Hoc02 respectively). Experiments were performed at 12 K for Gd-, TbNi5 and 20 K for HoCo2. A magnetic field of 3 T applied along the easy magnetization direction allows to obtain a single domain phase in the samples. Since the samples are bulk single crystals, the total fluorescence detection mode was used.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The RNi5 compounds crystallize in the simple hexagonal CaCuj-type structure with the rare earth in a high symmetry position (6/mmm). The 3d shell of Ni is almost full and its contribution to magnetism is small. The magnetic properties come essentially from the rare earths. These compounds, widely investigated in the past, appear as well suited compounds to improve our knowledge of the XMCD at the R L2,3-edges.</p><p>I. The XMCD spectra present huge and well structured dichroic signals at both the R L, 3 and the Ni Kedges. In TbNi5 structures due to the quadrupolar (2~ -&gt; 4fi transitions (E2) are clearly observed, about 5 eV below the edge, in both the Tb L2 and L3-edge dichroic spectra. At the Gd L3-edge the small negative structure below the edge can also be attributed to the E2 contribution. In addition a positive structure approximately at 7 eV above the edge is observed. These structures were not observed in previous measurements on powdered samples. At the Gd La-edge the structure above the edge has evolved in a well resolved negative peak, while no clear structure below the edge is resolved. Nevertheless the asymmetry at the bottom of the main negative peak reveals that a E2 contribution is still present. II. At the Co K-edge a huge, up to 0.6%, and well resolved signal is observed. It exhibits a three-peak structure, very similar to the one observed in the RNi5 compounds, but with a small positive structure in the middle of the negative one. Recent studies at the Co K-edge in the RCo5 compounds have shown that for magnetic rare earths, the Co K-edge dichroic spectra present the same three peak structure. In these compounds the Co has a strong magnetic moment, pcO ~1.5 l&amp;. The calculations of the Co K-edge spectra, using the multiple-scattering framework proposed by Brouder et al. t, have shown that in TbCo5 the first peak comes almost exclusively from the scattering of the photoelectron by the spin-orbit of the neighbors and that the scattering by the Tb d shells dominates 2. Presents results show that the XMCD structure is apparently independent of the strong or weak magnetic moment of the 3d metal. Calculations are under way. These experimental results have been presented at the 10th. International Conference on X-ray Absorption Fine Structure in Chicago (August 1998).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>II. At the Ni K-edge the dichroic spectra have a three-peak structure: positive, negative and then positive. The first positive peak has the same intensity in GdNi5 and TbNi5, while the negative one is strongly reduced in the Gd compound. Surprisingly the XMCD signals present a huge intensity (up to 0.4%) compared to the signals observed so far at the K-edge of pure Ni metal and even at K-edge of Fe or Co metal. The large peak intensities and their evolution between the Gd and the Tb compounds show up the strong influence of the rare earth on the structure of the dichroic spectra at the Ni K-edge . Hoc02 crystallizes in the cubic Laves phase structure. At low temperatures, ltcO = 1 pg. I. At the Ho L2,3-edges, the XMCD spectra are polluted by the fluorescence of the Co K-edge. Corrections and analysis of the spectra are not completely finished.</figDesc></figure>
