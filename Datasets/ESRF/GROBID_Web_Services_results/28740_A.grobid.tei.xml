<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A data set for a Se-Met derivative of a MalA crystal diffracting to 2.5 Å resolution was collected, but was only complete to 4.5 Å resolution due to a large cell (P2 1 a= 322 Å, b=158 Å, c= 321 Å, β= 119 deg.) coupled with high mosaicity. Crystals of unsubstituted MalA were also tested but only diffracted to 4 Å.</p><p>Data leading to structure determination of the β-1,4-mannanase from C. fimi were also collected. The abstract from an article in press in Biochemistry is enclosed. Data for the mannotriose complex were collected at MAX-LAB.</p><p>The structure and characterization of a modular endo-β-1,4-mannanase from Cellulomonas fimi.</p><p>Jérôme Le Nours, Lars Anderson, Dominik Stoll, Henrik Stålbrand, Leila Lo Leggio</p><p>The endo-β-1,4-mannanase from the soil bacterium Cellulomonas fimi is a modular plant cell wall degrading enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the backbone of mannan, one of the most abundant polysaccharides of the hemicellulosic network in the plant cell wall. The crystal structure of a recombinant truncated endo β-1,4-mannanase from Cellulomonas fimi (CfMan26A-50K) was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.25 Å resolution using the molecular replacement technique. The overall structure of the enzyme consists of a core (β/α) 8 -barrel catalytic module characteristic of clan GH-A, connected via a linker to an immunoglobulin-like module of unknown function. A complex with the oligosaccharide mannotriose to 2.9 Å resolution has also been obtained. Both the native structure and the complex show a cacodylate ion bound at the -1 subsite, while subsites -2, -3, and -4 are occupied by mannotriose in the complex. Enzyme kinetic analysis and the analysis of hydrolysis products from manno-oligosaccharides and mannopentitol suggest five important active-site cleft subsites. CfMan26A-50K has a high affinity -3 subsite with Phe325 as an aromatic platform, which explains the mannose releasing property of the enzyme. Structural differences with the homologous Cellvibrio japonicus β-1,4-mannanase (CjMan26A) at the -2 and -3 subsites may explain the poor performance of CfMan26A mutants as "glycosynthases".</p></div>			</div>
