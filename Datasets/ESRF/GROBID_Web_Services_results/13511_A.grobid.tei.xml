Another electronic transition at ~28 GPa from paramagnetic to normal metal is not accompanied by an appreciable structural change.</p><p>In the case of FeCl 2 the consequence of structural transformations is different from FeI 2 .</p><p>The structural phase transition from /3 CdI 2 -type phase to a new +3 phase takes place at ~30 GPa, which is accompanied by significant change of magnetic structure. MS observes additional sluggish transition to a diamagnetic state at the range 42-60 GPa. This transition could be consistent to an onset of HS-LS crossover or to a 0RWW transition resulting in a metallic nonmagnetic state. Further XRD and resistivity studies to pressures ~60 GPa could elucidate the nature of this transition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>WLWOH STRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF THE HIGH-SPIN → LOW-SPIN CROSSOVER INDUCED BY HIGH-PRESSURE IN SELECTIVE Fe(III)RI DSSOLFDQWV (* indicates experimentalists): Moshe Pasternak, School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University Gregory Rozenberg, School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University 5HSRUW: ± 3UHVVXUH,QGXFHG WUDQVIRUPDWLRQV LQ 5)H2 SHURYVNLWHV 5 3U /D The 0RWW insulators 5FeO 3 (5 UHDUHDUWK perovskites are isostructural with the ortho-nickelates, which undergo a temperature driven insulator-metal (IM) transition at temperature T MI that steeply decrease with increasing size of rare-earth ion [1]. Though this temperature-driven phenomena has been observed only with 5NiO 3 , we have recently selected the Pr-and Laorthoferrite, to investigate the structural aspects of the basic phenomena of GG FRUUHODWLRQ EUHDNGRZQ resulting from very high static pressures. The XRD studies using the TAU miniature DAC in the angle-dispersive mode have shown that in the range 30 -55 GPa the low-pressure (/3) orthorhombic perovskite phase undergoes a first-order phase transition to a new high-pressure (+3) phase. Diffraction patterns of the PrFeO 3 +3 phase could be attributed to the same orthorhombic perovskite structure but with a reduced Faxis; for LaFeO 3 the structural transition near 30 GPa attributed to the transition to a tetragonal phase. The transition was accompanied by a ~2% volume decrease and a precipitous drop of the resistance explained as due to an accelerated gap-closure. Further increase of pressure up to 126 GPa for PrFeO 3 and to 103 GPa for LaFeO 3 does not reveal any additional structural changes and is accompanied by a sluggish IM transition which is uncompleted to 130 GPa. Mössbauer studies (MS) pertinent to the +3 phase documented for the first time the complex properties of the precursor state of the magnetic oxides at the IM transition, such as the onset of a high spin-low spin (HS-LS) crossover and following appearance of paramagnetic state near the IM transition. To elucidate the nature of the discussed electronic and magnetic transformations a further XRD studies to higher pressures beyond that in which IM transition occurs is necessary 1. J. B. Torrance, P. Lacorre, A. I. Nazzal et al., Phys. Rev. %, 8209 (1992). +LJK3UHVVXUH 6WXGLHV RI ,URQ +DOLGHV The pressure-induced Mott transition phenomena is characterized by the concurrency of insulator-metal transition and the collapse of the magnetic moment in the absence of a structural phase transition. One main issue is to investigate the pressure region close to the Mott transition where present Mott-Hubbard models [1] predict the onset of D PHWDO ZLWK PRPHQWV prior to the total collapse of the magnetic moment. Our studies with FeI 2 indeed support such a model showing that the transition from antiferromagnetic insulator to a normal metal is realised in two steps:at ~20 GPa FeI 2 undergoes an isostructural phase transition to paramagnetic metal state.</figDesc></figure>
