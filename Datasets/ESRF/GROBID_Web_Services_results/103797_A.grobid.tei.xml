<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ethylene is a petrochemically derived monomer and the largest from the olefins market, with an estimated annual increase rate of 4% per year. It is mainly produced through an energy demanding process, named steam cracking. The on-purpose ethylene production via the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (EDH) route, implementing a catalyst, is considered the most attractive alternative to the conventional industrial process <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In EDH, the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant (Eq. 1) is gaining more attention due to its environmental effects, mild oxidizing nature, compared to O2 and its advantage in moderating the reaction exothermicity. C2H6(g) + CO2(g) = C2H4(g) + H2O(l) + CO(g) ΔΗ 0 25 o C = 134 kJ•mol -1 (CO2-EDH, Eq.1) Our 5wt% Fe catalyst, supported on a mixed oxide of 10wt%NiO-MgO-ZrO2, calcined at 700oC for 5 h, was found to be selective for C-H bond scission during CO2-EDH at 650 o C and atmospheric pressure, attaining 90% selectivity at C2H6 conversion level of ~23% <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. However, the role of the support, mainly consisting of low Z elements, such as Mg and O, still awaits clarification. The aim of this proposal is to identify in situ, under reaction conditions, the electronic modifications occurring at the support structure, as they define the activity, selectivity and stability of the whole catalyst.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>An operando XRS/XES study was performed in ID20, for three main samples: 1) 5 wt%Fe impregnated on previously synthesized MgO-ZrO2 support (named Fe/MgZr) 2) 5 wt%Fe impregnated on previously synthesized 10 wt% NiO-MgO-ZrO2 (named Fe-two pot) and 3) 5Fe-10NiO-MgO-ZrO2 synthesized in one step (named Fe-one pot).The aforementioned catalysts were calcined at 700 o C for 5 h (Fe-two pot) and 800 o C for 4h (Fe-one pot). XRS speactra were collected both ex-situ and in-situ. For the in-situ experiments, a reactor cell with a spherical Kapton dome that allows the x-rays access, provided by ESRF, was used (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), while the XRS/XES measurements were performed at four edges: O K-and Mg L2,3-edges for the former and Fe-and Ni-edges for the latter. CO2-EDH reaction conditions were imposed: 9 vol% C2H6, 9 vol% CO2 and the rest He, Treac=650°C, 10-20 ml/min of total flow rate using callibrated mass flow controllers (brought by the users). During a typical experiment, the catalyst was placed in the reactor cell as a pellet, while the time-on-stream (TOS) during the CO2-EDH reaction was between 4-7 h. Unfortunately, the combination of high reaction temperatures (&gt;600 o C) and beam radiation for long TOS (&gt;2 h) resulted in sample damage. To enable the in-situ measurements without beam damage, it was suggested by the local contact to collect the XRS spectra at low temperature (room temperature, RT) and under pure He flow. The latter was successful as data of good quality were collected, after the CO2-EDH reaction step, facilitating the monitoring of electronic modifications during reaction conditions. The XRS/XES measurements were coupled with kinetic measurements based on gas-phase compositions obtained during CO2 EDH reaction, from a mass spectometer (MS) provided by ESRF. Ex-situ measurements were also performed over 7 reference and 4 used materials (used during experimental campaign in AUTH for chemical looping CO2-assisted EDH at 600 o C); reference samples: pure MgO, 5wt% Fe/MgO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, support MgO-ZrO2, support 10wt% NiO-MgO-ZrO2, pure ZrO2; used samples: after 4, 8, 10 and 12 cycles of chemical looping and after 1 h under C2H6/He flow, i.e., absence of CO2 in the feed stream. A mechanical mixture of the same composition as the examined samples was also tested for comparison purposes.</p><p>Experiments performed and first results for Mg L2,3 signals Mg L2,3 edge spectra of Fe-one pot and Fe-two pots samples were recorded in-situ at RT in He after 3 and 5 h of CO2-EDH. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>-left compares the abovementioned spectra with the sample treated for 1h under C2H6/He flow. All the spectra exhibit three main peaks at ~52.5, ~56 and ~57.5 eV. Concerning the ratio of the peak intensities, some differences can be highlighted, originating mainly from the peak at 52.5 eV: the longer TOS results in structural modification of the one-pot catalyst. More specifically, by comparing the spectrum after 3 h with the spectrum after 5 h, a higher peak intensity at 52.5 eV can be seen. The latter peak corresponds to Mg at tetrahedral coordination. Thus, under CO2-EDH reaction conditions, Mg obtains a more tetrahedral coordination.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>-right compares ex-situ samples that were previously used during CO2-EDH in a chemical looping feed mode. The abovementioned experiments were performed in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the samples were brought to ESRF for ex-situ measurements. Strong differences can be seen from the peak at 52.5 eV.</p><p>In-situ and ex-situ measurements were also performed at O-K edge and Fe-and Ni-edges (XES measurements), but the data analysis is still in-progress. Concluding, we have performed combined XRS and XES in-situ and ex-situ measurements on three Fe-based catalytic materials. The in-situ CO2-EDH measurements were coupled with a MS to follow the reaction progress as a function of time-on-stream. Fortunately, the problem that we faced with the beam damage was quickly solved by the local contact and there was no significant waste of beamtime. At the current state, we see that our results shed light on the role of the NiO-MgO-ZrO2 on the C-H bond scission selectivity and thus we foresee a publication in the future.  </p></div>
