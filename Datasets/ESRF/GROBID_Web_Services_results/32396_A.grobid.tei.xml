<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to measure, using anomalous small angle x-ray scattering, the distribution function of the charge balancing ions (chosen to be Rb + ) at the interface of the recently discovered (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed 2004, 43, 3568-3571  James K. Beattie and Alex M. Djerdjev) oil in water emulsions produced without surfactants. Measurements were performed in the vicinity of t Rb K-edge (15.2 keV) and data were analysed using core-shell model involving emulsion droplets and the shell of Rb+ ions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment proved to be at the margin of sensitivity and stability for the system and the instrument but an upper level for the concentration of the ion sheet and its dimension have been set and an energy dependent crosssection was found. The polydispersity of the emulsion was far greater than expected and as a result the fringes in the form factor could not be observed. The actual size of the emulsion was determined by USAXS and a fit to polydisperse sphere model. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows typical USAXS plots for selected emulsions studied and the corresponding fits. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> depicts the combined SAXS and USAXS results for emulsion 12.1.</p><p>Much was learned about the emulsion physical chemistry in a series of cuncurrent experiments. The detectivity of the counterions can be improved by increasing the surface charge density and will be proposed. 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 Emulsion 12.1 I(q) (mm -1 ) q (nm -1 ) SAXS USAXS Fit Figure 2: SAXS and USAXS intensities for emulsion 12.1.

This stability approaches 1/1000 and typical ASAXS scan spans less than 10 minutes.</p><p>The experiment reqiuired precision in the absolute integrated scattering intensity and stabliity of the emulsion and measuring system to fractions of 1 mm -1 on the absolute scale. This was achieved and is a tribute to the quality of the ID-2 instrument and its team. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows typical stability in intensity reached within 1 h of the emulsion preparation. The stability of the emulsion was further checked by the constancy of the pH in the 100 ml emulsion container over 24 hours. The final scattering functions after all corrections for different incident energies are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>.
