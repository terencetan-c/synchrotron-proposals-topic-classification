<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment we studied the plastic relaxation that occurs at the (In,Ga)N/GaN interface. We study films with an indium concentration of nominally 20% and thickness in the range of 40-60 nm. These films are fully strained (no misfit dislocations observed), but plastic relaxation and thus dislocation nucleation and glide may be triggered through thermal annealing of these samples. We followed these thermally activated dislocation kinetics in real-time by full field X-ray diffraction microscopy (FFXDM) at ID01 during in-situ annealing. To increase the time-resolution, we used a coplanar grazing incidence geometry and optimized the beam shaping optics (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). To achieve this, we selected the 013 reflection of GaN and tuned the X-ray energy to approx. 7.6 keV leading to an incidence angle close to the critical angle of GaN (0.3°). The exact incidence angle could be fine-tuned by changing the X-ray energy in a small range or by selecting the direction of the sample miscut which was 0.5 °. This way, we could switch between the film and substrate peaks, tune the penetration depth and the footprint size. The scattering angle (2θ) for this reflection and this energy was around 65.4°, which represents a compromise of low image distortion (minimal at 90°) and high elastic scattering intensity (proportional to cos 2θ). An image of the diffracting regions of the samples was obtained by an objective lens combined with a CCT camera at a large distance of ~6 m. The field of view of FFXDM at this conditions is approximately 100 μm in both vertical and horizontal directions. To assure that most of the incident flux was used we matched the footprint size of the incident beam on the sample surface to this field of view. This was achieved by pre-focusing the incident beam to a spot size of 5 μm × 100 μm in the horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. These conditions give us a diffraction contrast image of a 100 μm × 100 μm region in within ~2 s of exposure time. We can choose either substrate or film peak sind the dislocations at the interface cause strain in both lattices. The small angle of incidence provides sensitivity to surface-near regions. The ideal imaging conditions have been obtained when incidence angle was detuned ~ 0.015° from the substrate peak, which leads to maxima of intensity from strained regions close to dislocation lines (weak beam contrast).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We annealed 4 samples with In0.20Ga0.80N layers of various thickness and deposited on substrates with different threading dislocation density (TDD). The first annealed sample with 60 nm thick In0.20Ga0.80N layer deposited on GaN bulk substrate with TDD in the range of 10 6 cm -2 already exhibited a quite high density of misfit dislocations. We performed several annealing steps with a duration of 30 minutes in the temperature range from 300 -600 °C, but we did not observe formation of any new dislocations. Consecutively, we studied a sample with thinner 50 nm layer deposited on the same kind of a GaN bulk substrate with TDD in the range of 10 6 cm -2 and we choose for the observation an area with low initial density of misfit (a+c) dislocations (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</p></div>
