<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Islet function is damaged during the process of diabetic development and this is reflected on their morphology. To measure the size and number of islets in whole pancreas in the healthy and diabetic rodents, we have performed the X-ray phase contrast imaging on the samples at ID17 beamline station in ERSF. We clearly observed the islets in the pancreas with the imaging and primarily estimated that the number of islets were reduced at diabetic conditions. However, quality of the images was rather lower than expected and is chanllenge to make segmentation automatically by using software. Alternatively we are currently trying to use different manual-track methods to make the segmentation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mice (C57bl):</head><p>Pancreas 4% -PFA Mice were either injected with streptozotocin (STZ) for 1 day and sacrificed on the 7 th day, or injected with STZ for 5 days and sacrificed the 6 th . Control mice were not injected with anything. All mice were weighed and their blood glucose levels were measured before sacrifice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rat:</head><p>Pancreas 4% -PFA Young and old Wistar and GK rats were used. All rats were weighed and their blood glucose levels were measured before sacrifice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation:</head><p>-Sample is pre-soaked with ethanol after harvest.</p><p>-Sample is placed in 0.8 ml 4% PFA in a horizontally positioned 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Avoid bubbles. -The lid is closed and the tube is positioned upside down on the stage ready for x-ray.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation:</head><p>-Sample pre-soaked with ethanol after harvest was placed at room temperature for 1 hour. -Sample is then placed in 3-4 ml 4% PFA in a 5 ml vial. Excess PFA was removed. -The lid is closed and the vial is positioned on the stage ready for x-ray.</p><p>After placing the sample tube/vial on a marked tape on the stage followed by safety procedures, images were taken under the following settings:</p><p>-Stage rotation: every 45° -Rotation speed: 0.3°/sec -Maximum rotation: 180° -Image integration time: 0.1 -2000 projections/stage, 5-10 stages, 3.2 mm frame height, 15.97 mm frame width -Pixel size: 7.8 µm β Cell Mass in Diabetic Rodents:</p><p>Images Acquisition</p><p>First the start of the scanning point is determined which is usually from the base of the stage. After starting the x-ray, the machine automatically acquires images by rotating the stage at given speed and angle, and firing x-ray. The images are then combined and processed for analysis. All raw images acquired are in .edf format.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="4,41.15,207.72,281.91,267.29" type="bitmap" /></figure>
