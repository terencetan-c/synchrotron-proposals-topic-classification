<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is known to exist in several crystal modifications (α, β, γ, δ) of which the βand δ-phases are the most interesting ones due to their ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One way to obtain the β phase is by crystallization from the melt using very high cooling rates (above 2000 °Cs -1 ) or by isothermal crystallization at high supercooling with the maximum crystallization rate around 20 °C. Another way to ease the formation of β-phase is by introducing artificial conformational defects, such as TrFE (trifluoroethylene) and CFE (chlorofluoroethylene), resulting in P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) copolymers.</p><p>PVDF and its copolymers are subjected to (non-)isothermal crystallization protocols using a fast scanning chip calorimeter and in-situ WAXD collection was asured using an in-house developed sample holder, which is accessible for X-rays <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. This sample holder was connected to a liquid nitrogen dewar in order to reach a low surrounding temperature (0 °C) and allow fast linear cooling rates. The non-isothermal experiments consisted of cooling the samples at different rates (between 30-1300 °Cs -1 ) and one WAXD pattern was collected at 0 °C. The cooling rates were too fast to follow the crystallization with WAXD in a temperatureresolved way. The samples were also isothermally crystallized at temperatures between 60 and 140 °C and the solid phase formation was followed with time-resolved WAXD.</p><p>Preliminary results are reported in a master thesis (by Eline Baes and supervised by D. Baeten and prof. B.</p><p>Goderis), but require some additional experiments and data processing before publication in a scientific journal is possible. Some of the findings are reported below:</p><p> β-phase not (or barely) observed in isothermally crystallized PVDF. Lower Tc's are needed which could not be reached with our setup  β-phase observed in isothermally crystallized 70/30 P(VDF-TrFE)  β-phase observed in isothermally crystallized 80/20 P(VDF-TrFE at temperatures in the high range of the crystallization rate vs temperature plot. (α-phase observed at lower Tc's)  β-phase not observed after cooling (rates up to 1300 °Cs -1 ) PVDF to room temperature  β-phase observed after cooling 70/30 P(VDF-TrFE) to room temperature at all rates  A mixture of βand α-phase observed after cooling 80/20 P(VDF-TrFE) to room temperature</p><p>[1] D. <ref type="bibr">Baeten et al., Macromol.
