Zhuoqing Li TUHH, Institute for Materials and X-Ray Physics Report:</p><p>Temperature-dependent WAXS/SAXS experiments on the self-assembly behaviour of the DOPA-based discotic ionic liquid crystals confined in cylindrical channels of anodic alumina oxide (AAO) are carried out at the BM02 beamline. The measurements are performed in a q range from 0.1 Å -1 to 3.0 Å -1 with a beam spot size of 700 μm between 310 K and 373 K. During the experiment a custom-built copper sample cell with a beryllium cap is used. A Lakeshore 336 temperature controller and a Julabo water cooling system is used to control the temperature and nitrogen is connected to the cell to ensure an inert atmosphere. In order to block the excess signal from the beryllium cap and enhance the diffraction intensity from samples, a self-made mask is applied on the WAXS detector to block out the diffraction from beryllium cap at high diffraction angle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The samples are always mounted with their long pore axis perpendicular to the incident X-ray beam. During the measurement the sample is first heated to the isotropic phase and then slowly cooled down (0.15 K/min) to the crystalline phase via the liquid crystalline phase and then heated with the same speed back to the isotropic phase. Additional ω-scans from 0° to 90° with respect to the AAO membrane surface normal are performed at distinct temperatures in both the crystalline phase and the liquid-crystalline phase to explore the translational order of the liquid crystal molecules at different phases under nanoconfinement. The experimental results are analyzed with the python script provided by the beamline scientists of BM02 and an own Matlab script. One typical result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. These diffraction patterns are observed during the temperature scan of a cyclic DOPA-based ionic liquid crystal with a side chain of 14 carbon atoms confined in AAO membranes of 180 nm pore size and hydrophobic pore walls. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a) shows a six-fold diffraction pattern at a q value of 0.178 Å -1 , in this case indicating a circular concentric configuration of the liquid crystal molecules in the nanopores. With the temperature going down to the crystalline phase as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b), the six-fold pattern gradually disappears and two diffraction spots in the vertical direction remain, which are signatures of the axial configured liquid crystal molecules in nanopores. The two diffraction spots at horizontal direction in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(b) are considered to be the signal form excess bulk material on the membrane surface. Thus for this ionic liquid crystal with 14 carbon atoms in the side chain, an insteresting textural transition is observed between its liquid-crystalline and the crystalline phase. Similar measurements are carried out with liquid crystals of different side chain length in different pore sizes. The preliminary analysis of the data shows a strong dependence between the side-chain length and the molecular configuration. Further data analysis and a preparation of a manuscript is in progress. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1Self-made mask on WAXS detector and custom-built copper sample cell.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,92.65,38.25,418.57,198.15" type="bitmap" /></figure>
