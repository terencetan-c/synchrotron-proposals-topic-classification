Cyril and Methodius in Trnava</p><p>Report: Micrometeorites (MM) are microscopic (~100 µm), mostly spherical remnants of cosmic dust that can be collected on the Earth's surface. The determination of the origin of individual MMs with regard to their formation in the solar system (e.g. asteroid collisions or comet sublimations) has so far remained an experimental challenge -the determination of iron minerals with Mössbauer spectroscopy at the ESRF can make an important contribution to this. The micrometeorites analyzed here were obtained from an up to 3.8 million years old timeresolved sediment profile from the Atacama Desert in Chile. Extraterrestial micro objects were measured by synchrotron Mössbauer-Spectroscopie to characterize their inner and outer layer composition, and assumptions about their origin can be made. Two different sample groups were analysed for their different iron phases. Both groups contain different subgroups of samples, which are explained below. One group consisted of micrometeorites excavated in the Atacama desert in Chile. Due to the different depths the meteorites were found in, their time of formation could be approximated and was then verified by 10 Be-dating. Depending on the depth of the deposit, the age of the micrometeorite varies between a few 10,000 years and several million years. The second group consisted of the Luna 24 sample, which was sourced on the moon in a sample return mission in 1976.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Micrometeorites:</head><p>Overall, 16 micrometeorites (between 60 -100 µm in diameter) were analysed. They were categorized into three different groups of micrometeorites, 9 stony, 6 iron and 1 stony-iron micrometeorite were chosen. At first, the absorption maximum was determined using absorption scans. Therefore it can be estimated, that the measurements were approximately taken in the middle of the micrometeorites. Additionally, some of the samples were measured at the edge, to detect composition changes between the center and the surface. Two of the iron micrometeorites could only be measured at the edge, due to the absorption being too high at the center.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows three examples of meausured Mössbauer-spectra and the fitted data of the analysis, one for each group. Olivine, magnetite, maghemite, α-(Fe,Ni), austenitic Fe, pyroxene/glassy Fe(II) and smectite phases were found in the micrometeorites, providing much more informations about their iron phases than the previous XRF measurements. For the stony micrometeorites olivine is a characteristic phase, for the iron micrometeorites with a higher nickel and chromium content austenitic iron respectively. The stony-iron micrometeorite had α-(Fe,Ni) in the center as the main phase. On the edge magnetite and possibly a smectite phase were predominantly found.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Three examples of the different types of micrometeorites with their corresponding spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lunar 24:</head><p>Since the sample consists of an inhomogeneous mixture of single particles, characteristic groups were defined and suitable particles from each group were measured. They are namely melt spherules (3), black grains (2), colourless minerals (1) and red minerals (1). At least one sample from each group was chosen for analysis. The size of the measured grains varied between 50 -75 µm. All samples were measured at the point of highest absorbtion. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows exemplary particles. One melt spherule and one red mineral with their corresponding spectra are shown below. In general pyroxene/glassy Fe(II) was the main component of the grains except the red mineral grain, there it was ilmenite. Nanoparticular Fe(0) phases were also found in some samples. -10 0 10 Relative absorption Velocity (mm/s) Olivine Smectite Background Magnetite -10 0 10 Relative absorption Velocity (mm/s) Austenitic Fe Background -10 0 10 Amorph Fe(III) Background Pyroxene/Glassy Fe(II) α-(Fe,Ni) Maghemite Relative absorption Velocity (mm/s) -10 0 10 Relative absorption Velocity (mm/s) Pyroxene/Glassy Fe(II) Fe(0) np Background -10 0 10 Relative absorption Velocity (mm/s) Fe(0) np Ilmenite Background 30-16 (JF1) Stony 50-01 (JF7) Iron 130-06 (JF14) Stony-Iron center edge center F12 melt spherule F19 red mineral</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Two different types of Lunar 24 samples with their corresponding spectra.</figDesc></figure>
