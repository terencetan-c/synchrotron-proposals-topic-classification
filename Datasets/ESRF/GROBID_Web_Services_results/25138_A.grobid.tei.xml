<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The changes of fracture surfaces geometry and extend are studied using X-ray tomography during aperture increase due to CO 2 -rich fluid percolation. Dissolution experiments were conducted on two micritic rock samples; one pure calcite end-member and one with typical composition for marine carbonates (85% calcite). High-resolution digital images of the fracture geometry allow quantifying the surface properties changes over four spatial scales with a resolution of 4.91 mm. Fracture surfaces are self-affine with an initial dimension of 2.5. Dissolution of the pure-calcite sample is clearly a process of homogeneous chemical ''erosion'' of the surface elevation: fractal dimension and specific surface remains constant (1.5 times the planar surface). Conversely, for the 85% calcite sample, initial topographic surfaces of the fracture walls evolve rapidly toward ''non-topographic'' interfaces displaying overhangs due the preferential dissolution of the carbonate grains. In this case, the conventional definition of the effective aperture must be revisited. Such structures can only be assessed from 3D observations. As dissolution progresses, the specific surface increases strongly, more than 5 times the planar surface, and probably faster than the reactive surface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>[2] Limestone aquifers constitute a major reserve of fresh water throughout the world. Fractures, which develop in low permeability rocks, are the principal path for water flow and contamination. An increasing number of studies is devoted to understand the physics of flow and transport in fracture networks [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adler and Thovert, 1999]</ref>. For a connected fracture network, large-scale flow and hydrodispersive transport is first controlled by the geometrical properties of the individual fractures. In addition to fracture aperture, surface roughness and aperture tortuosity are usually put forward as the key parameters that control flow type and dispersion regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Brown et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Detwiler et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Glover et al., 1997]</ref>. Measurements of spatial distribution changes of the fracture aperture in the course of dissolution were achieved only recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Dijk et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Durham et al., 2001]</ref>, producing important constraints for modelling flow and dissolution patterns. Large uncertainties still remain on the relation that links the macroscopic evolution of the aperture and the microscopic (grain scale) morphological evolution of the fracture walls that controls fluid-rock fluxes.</p><p>[3] For smooth laminar flow, velocity distribution across the fracture section is parabolic, u(z) = u 0 (1 À 4z 2 /a 2 ), where u 0 is the maximum velocity and a is the aperture. The aperture-scale Pe ´clet number, Pe, denotes the ratio of the characteristic time for transverse homogenization by diffusion a 2 /4D m , to the mean longitudinal residence time a/2hui z , where hui z is the fracture-section averaged velocity (hui z = 2/3 u 0 ). If Pe ) 1, Taylor-Aris dispersion approximation holds with the longitudinal dispersion D L proportional to Pe 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Detwiler et al., 2000]</ref>. It is then possible to analyse processes in term of resident concentration of a solute, hc i i z = R a c i dz. Far from equilibrium, the change in the concentration is controlled by the hydrodispersive transport (embodied in the differential operator J(hc i i z )), the adimensional saturation index I(hc i i z ) $ 1À hc i i z /c i * (where c i * is the equilibrium concentration), the kinetic mass transfer rate constant k r , and the extend of the contact area between the fluid and the rock (inhibiter-catalyser effects are not taken into account). With A R the reactive area by unit fluid volume, macroscopic balance equation for small variation of species i concentration, hc i i z , is <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Lasaga, 1998]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">@hc i i z =@t ¼ J hc i i 2 ð ÞþA r k r I hc i i z ð Þ<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>Recognizing that k r is an intrinsic property of the considered reaction for a given pH profile, temporal change of the dissolution rate is controlled by both the change in A R and a.</p><p>The reciprocal effects of aperture variability changes on dissolution were investigated through different numerical approach by Be ´kri et al. <ref type="bibr">[1997]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dijk and Berkowitz [1998]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hanna and Rajaram [1998]</ref>. In these works, the evolution of A r was not taken into account. Indeed, measuring A r is challenging. Even the description of the effective reactive area for polycrystalline altered rocks in relation to the one of the pure phase used in experimental determination of k r in batch reactor is debated [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gautier et al., 2001]</ref>. Alternatively, assuming J(c i ) known, the product A R k r can be evaluated from (1), measuring the difference in reactant concentration between the outlet and the inlet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Kieffer et al., 1999]</ref>. However, providing that continuous measurement of such low concentration is possible, results reflect only averaged values A R . To progress toward a full spatio-temporal quantification of the fracture properties, we present here a study based on X-ray tomography using the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). For this first attempt, we measure the changes of aperture and fracture walls geometry at different stages of kinetic-controlled dissolution due to flow of acidic water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Method</head><p>[4] Two samples S1 and S2 of cretaceous limestone cored from the same borehole are studied. S1 is composed of $100% calcite (clay &lt;1 w%) with 2.2% porosity. S2, is composed of 85 w% calcite, 10 w% dolomite, 5 w% clay with 5.6% porosity. Mini-cores of 6 mm diameter and 12 mm long were prepared to suit the optimal size for the ESRF-ID19 X-ray beam for non-local computed microtomography (CMT). A tensile fracture, sub-collinear to the core axis, was made. Then, the mini-cores were coated with epoxy to avoid any mechanical deformation during the percolation experiment.</p><p>[5] We use a 2048 2 pixels camera, with an effective pixel size of 4.91 mm. This setup allows a very intense monochromatic X-ray beam of 10mm 2 . Finally a 3D X-ray absorption image is computed from 900 radiographies acquired at every 0.2 degree of view angle. A bimodal segmentation algorithms based on challenge region growing allows individualizing the fracture volume.</p><p>[6] Dissolution is obtained by flowing, at a constant rate of 2.8 10 À9 m 3 .s À1 , pure water enriched with CO 2 at partial pressure of 0.1 MPa ( pH = 4 ± 0.1). Output pH is 5.1 ± 0.15. The effect of confining pressure (equal to the max pressure at the inlet) variation was negligible. The pressure at the outlet was maintained above 0.1 MPa in order to avoid CO 2 degassing in the mini-core. Because of the constant rate injection, Pe remains constant during the dissolution at value of $440.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Analyses</head><p>[7] Let define the adimensional reaction surface coefficient as S R = A R hai/2. At the initial stage, S R is estimated as the product of the volume fraction of the mineral involved in the given reaction, by the specific surface coefficient S S which denotes the tortuosity of the fracture walls (S S = 1 for a planar surface). It is assumed here that the fracture intersects the rock randomly. Usually, for numerical modeling, S R is kept constant and S S is initially evaluated and embedded in an ''efficient'' kinetic reaction rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Lasaga, 1998]</ref>. The validity of this relation in the course of dissolution is questionable: we will see later that (i) S S may change strongly during dissolution and (ii) the ratio S R /S S is probably non-constant in the case of non-pure calcite, due to preferential dissolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Fracture Walls and Aperture Changes 3.1.1. The Initial Stage</head><p>[8] The initial mean aperture along the central flow axe is 50 mm (s a = 8 mm) for S1 and 20 mm (s a = 7 mm) for S2. For both samples, the initial fracture surfaces are topographic (hereafter reported as Topographic Surfaces; TS), that is, to any x-y coordinate corresponds a single elevation z. Then, fracture walls are first analyzed by extracting the x-y projection of the CMT images, producing profilometryequivalent data set (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) to be characterized by classical statistical and spectral surface analysis. The area of a self-affine fractal surface increases with both its fractal dimension and s z 2 the variance of the surface elevation. Results display ubiquitous self-affine behaviour all over the measured scale range from 5 mm to 1 cm. The fractal dimension D = 2.5 ± 0.1, computed coherently using 1D and 2D power spectrum method [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Schmittbuhl et al., 1995]</ref> is isotropic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Evolution of S1</head><p>[9] The experiment consists of three dissolution steps with a mean aperture increase of 22 ± 2 mm for each of them. Dissolution of S1 appears as a uniform translation (chemical ''erosion'') of the x-y surfaces along the z axis. Both the fractal dimension D, and the variance of the surface elevation s z 2 remain constant: fracture walls stay TS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Evolution of S2</head><p>[10] The dissolution of S2 sample consists of three steps of variable duration (aperture increase of 4.5, 23 and 15 mm respectively). In contrast with S1, dissolution of S2 is noticeably heterogeneous. Cross sections of the final stage of the experiment (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>), show that fracture walls cannot be described anymore as TS (lets call it a Non-Topographic Surface or NTS). Note that the solid phase pixels (in black), are connected in 3D, so that the apparent isolated clusters on the cross sections reflect the 3D nature of the fracture walls. Indeed, where the surface is ''folded'', some x-y coordinate have several elevations z creating multiple overhangs and the analysis of 2D-projected digital images of the fracture walls is biased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>). The surfaces were analysed using isomorphic 3D-box-counting method (BCM) and isomorphic/non-isomorphic 2D-BCM on the x-z cross-sections. All those methods give similar results: a linear relation between the logarithm of the number of boxes of dimension l and the logarithm of l. This indicates that the self-affine fractal characteristic of the surface remains. A theoretical value of the fractal dimension of the surfaces can be calculated from the slope s of the former linear trend by the relation D BCM = Às for 3D-BCM and D BCM = Às + 1 for 2D-BCM. A value of D BCM = 2.2 ± 0.1 was calculated for the fracture surfaces of S1 and S2 at the initial stage. D BCM increases toward 2.4 ± 0.1 for the final stage of the dissolution of S2 whereas it stays at the initial value for S1. Albeit the noticeable, but expected [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Schmittbuhl et al., 1995]</ref>, difference between the dimension measured by spectral methods and the BCM, the results reveal a quantifiable increase of the fractal dimension that comes together with an increase, of the variance of the surface s z 2 in the course of dissolution of S2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Evolution of Specific Surface with Dissolution</head><p>[11] Specific surface coefficient S S (x, y) and fracture aperture a(x, y) were measured from the 3D CMT images of S1 and S2. When fluid-rock interface is a NTS, a(x, y) represents the cumulative aperture a 0 (x, y) as explained on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>. Correlation between x-averaged hS S i x and hai x were measured on a 250 mm width stripe (À125 &lt; x &lt; 125 mm) in order to avoid boundary effects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Results show that the values of hS S i x increase from 1.5 to 5 for S2, whereas they remain constant around 1.5 for S1. For S1, the spreading of hS S i x data is unchanged from the beginning to the end of the experiment while the mean aperture increases of about 70 mm. Conversely, S2 displays an increase of the hS S i x data spreading with increasing dissolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This scattering reflects the more and more localized dissolution, at micro-scale, observed on the cross sections (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion and Conclusions</head><p>[12] The characteristic time t r for the dissolution reaction CaCO 3 + H + ! Ca ++ + HCO À 3 is c i */A R k r . Applying (1) to the calcium concentration, c* is equal to 8.5 mol.m À3 and k r ranges from 6.3 10 À5 mol.m À2 .s À1 at the input to 1.6 10 À5 mol.m À2 .s À1 at the output (calculated from the k r À pH relation given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Plummer et al. [1978]</ref>). With A R = 2F Ca S S /a, where F Ca is the calcite fraction in the rock, t r ranges from 2.2 to 22 s in the case of S1 and from 1 to 6 s in the case of S2. Those values are comparable to the characteristic time for convection throughout the sample which range from 0.8 to 2.5 s as aperture increases. Disequilibrium occurs along the entire fracture length, under control of both the reaction kinetic and the convective transport (Damko ¨hler number ranging from 1 to 10). As a consequence, quasi-uniform dissolution is observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which corresponds to the case ''typical Damko ¨hler and typical Pe ´clet'' explored numerically by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dijk and Berkowitz [1998]</ref>. Equivalent situations were studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mourzenko et al. [1996]</ref> in the case of the deposition in self-affine fractures. From this macroscopically uniform dissolution, the present work shows that diverse complex microscopic patterns may arise from dissolution as soon as polycrystalline solids are concerned. The initial TS fluid-rock interface evolves rapidly towards NTS, which cannot be characterized using classical profilometry methods (roughness exponent, specific and reactive surfaces would be significantly underestimated).</p><p>[13] As a result of NTS development, the total specific surface increases strongly. However, the SEM observations reveal that the calcite specific surface or reactive surface may not increase in the same proportion: the increase of the total specific surface is mostly due to the increase of the exposed surface of the others mineral phases. Still, this increase cannot persist indefinitely and the exploration of longer dissolution time is necessary to study, the role of the mechanical ablation of the non-dissolved fraction. Presently,  it can be concluded from the apparently unconditional increase of S S with a, that the relation between S R and S S is certainly non-linear because of the preferential dissolution of the carbonated phase. We demonstrated that the fracture surface were intrinsically self-affine fractal all over the large range accessible by this imaging method (l C = 4.91 mm). It is probable that this behaviour persists until the average grain size; l GS = 2 mm (evaluated from SEM observations). By definition the specific surface coefficient Ss is proportional to (l C ) 2ÀD . From this relation, and assuming that s z 2 is independent of the observation scale, one can extrapolate the maximum values of S S as well as S R and A R from the values of D. Replacing l C by l GS. in the aforementioned relation, the maximum values of S S for S1 and S2.are 2.4 and 9.5 respectively.</p><p>[14] When fractures walls become NTS, the definition of the aperture a(x, y) becomes problematic (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) which may have strong implications on its use as a pertinent parameter for computing flow and transport processes. For example, the validity of the Hagen-Poiseuille cubic law, that link the permeability k to the square of the aperture of TStype fracture has been discussed by many researchers, which broadly conclude that the principal factor causing deviation from ideal parallel plate theory is the non-smooth geometry of fracture: NTS complicates the discussion as a single definition the fracture aperture is no longer possible. It is generally admitted that the effective hydraulic aperture is the one that would give identical pressure drop in parallel plan geometry for a given flow rate. For low flow rate and assuming that the mean asperities height remains negligible compared to the mean aperture, the effective aperture is certainly closer to the axial plan (x, y, z = 0) projection of the real aperture (a 00 (x, y) on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>) as it can be obtained using profilometry methods. The validity of this assertion for higher flow rate is questionable. More importantly, overhangs play probably an important role in the hydrodispersive transport processes. The storage of solute in the dead-end zones increases the retardation factor for tracers and pollutants transport. Taking into account such structures in the course of dispersion processes is tricky and requires further investigations: the effective aperture probably depends on the dominant dispersion regime and ranges from the cumulative aperture, a 0 (x, y), to the projected aperture a 00 (x, y).</p><p>[15] To our knowledge, there is very little published work aiming to observe directly morphological changes in fracture. The most comparable one was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Durham et al. [2001]</ref>, although classical profilometry measurements were used requiring opening out the sample at each dissolution stage to have access to the fracture surfaces. As demonstrated here, X-ray computed tomography is an efficient non-invasive measurement tool for investigating the variability of fracture geometrical properties and its changes due to chemically induced dissolution of the mineral phases.</p><p>[16] Acknowledgments.
