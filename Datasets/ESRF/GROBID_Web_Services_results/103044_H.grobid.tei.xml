<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Niefind group tested the diffraction properties of various enzyme crystals in complex with inhibitors, substrate analogues and potential allosteric regulators. At least one good data set for any complex could be collected.</p><p>We could collect several good data sets from the PsaPEH, SaPelC, pKM400, LipP, PPEP, CK2 projects and could solve the structures of LipP and SaPelC for the first time.</p><p>We have collected several full data sets of cp1 crystals treated with chemical/ligand C. Also, a few full data sets of three point-variants of cp1 were obtained in good resolutions. The chemical/ligand C and expected point-mutations were all structurally verified. In addition, we also obtained a few full diffraction data sets gcsmo between resolutions of 2.5-3.2 Angstrom which place a very good starting point for the project. The structure solution is under progress. The measurements were very successful.</p><p>Eight crystals of PPEP-Geo/PPEP-4 were subjected successful to x-ray diffraction experiments with good resolution of around 1.9 Ã….</p><p>Many thanks for the excellent support from the local contact!</p></div>
