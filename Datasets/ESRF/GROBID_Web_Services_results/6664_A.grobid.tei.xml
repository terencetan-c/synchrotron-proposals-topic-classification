<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Names and affiliations of applicants (*indicates experimentalists):</head><p>Report:</p><p>To determine the phase relations in the Fe-O system at high pressure and temperature is challenging because of the complexity of one of the phases in this system; wustite . At atmospheric pressure wustite, lS+@, forms eutectoidally at 843 K, where it crystallises in a highly defective form of the NaCl-type structure. Fqi,~O transforms from the cubic NaCl-type structure to a rhombohedral structure at 16 GPa at 300 @'I. A NiAs-type structure is observed at 90 GPa and 600 KlzJ. The bulk modulus of wustite has earlier been determined both by static and dynamic compression methods and values in the range from -140 to 180 GPa have been reported. The variation of the bulk modulus with degree of non-stoichiometry is uncertain and a study of an iron-rich (F~c.s@) and iron-deficient @+zQ-@ sample has been undertaken. Additionally, Fe&amp; have been investigated. At pressures around 25 GPa, Fe304 transforms from the cubic inverse-spine1 structure to a high -pressure structure (= h -Fe$&amp;)13! It has been suggested that the high -pressure phase is monoclinic,[D1 but the structure is still unresolved.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High-Pressure X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out using monochromatic radiation, I, -0.48 A, at BL3. The diffraction data were collected by a two dimensional image-plate detector. High pressure was generated using membrane diamond anvil cells (MDAC). The diamond anvils had a top surface diameter of 320 pm. The sample, small ruby grains and liquid nitrogen was loaded into a -150 pm diameter hole of a stainless steel gasket. The pressure was varied in the range from 0 to 40 GPa at room-temperature and determined by using the pressure induced shift of the ruby RI luminescent line.</p><p>The phase transition of Fe,r-xjO from the cubic to the rombohedral structure was seen in the X-ray diffraction patterns as a splitting of the 111 and 220 diffraction peaks (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). A broadening of the diffraction peaks is seen below the transition pressure. No corresponding broadening of the diffraction peaks is observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns of Fe&amp;. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of Fe304 at pressures below and above the transition. The p-V data of the cubic Fe+x)O are plotted in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The volume of Fe&amp;II was as a first approach calculated using only the 200 diffraction peak. Our results indicate that the bulk modulus of wustite is composition independent. Our p-V data of 1 -Fe304 are plotted together with results from earlier investigation (fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>		</body>
