<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main aims of our experiment HC1931 were :</p><p>1) measure the phonon spectra of FeSe 2) look for a signature at the tetragonal/orthorombic transition (TS~90K) (called nematic transition) through a softening of an acoustic phonon 3) determine the influence of the superconductivity (Tc~8K) on the phonon spectra.</p><p>We have reached the first goal. Moreover, by measuring down to 80K below Ts we have found a softening of one of the acoustic branches, related to the nematic transition. Unfortunately, the tiny change in energy and the very low energy of the phonon involved (due to the proximity to the Γ point), force us to use a high resolution configuration inducing a strong reduction of the X-ray flux, and increasing strongly the acquisition time for each temperature point. This first evidence is not strong enough to be published as it is.  90K. Below 9K, FeSe shows a sharp superconducting transition. Crystal from the same batch has shown quantum oscillations [Audouard].</p><p>The sample was glued with the (b,c) plane in the beam -detector plane. The high-resolution silicon backscattering monochromator was configured for the (9,9,9) reflection at an incident energy of 17.794 keV giving an energy resolution of ~3meV. For each Q point, we scan the energy from -20meV up to 45meV. Using 6 pairs of detectors/analysers we were able to efficiently map the phonon dispersion along the ΓX (along the [100] direction) and ΓM ( [110] direction) lines, at proximity of the Q*=(2 0 0) and (2 2 0) Bragg peaks. The Stokes and anti-Stokes modes are clearly observed at 300K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The very weak elastic contribution evidences the small level of structural defects in the FeSe crystals and the good quality of the sample. We used least-square minimization with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and fitted phonons modes to a damped harmonic oscillator model (DHO) with Bose factor and convoluted by the Lorentzian experimental resolution function. The experimental phonon dispersions at room temperature is shown Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and compared to the already published calculations. A good agreement is found for the acoustic branches. For the optical branches, the GGA calculations of non-spin polarized predict the good dispersion, but shifted at higher energy [Subedi08].</p><p>To look for a signature of the nematics transition, and in order to optimize the beam time, we decided to privilege the access to a large part of the reciprocal space instead of the lowest temperature. The temperature of the sample was controlled thanks to a flux of cold Nitrogen (cryojet). At the lowest temperature (80K), the splitting of the Bragg peak due to the orthorombic distortion was checked. We used the <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">11)</ref> reflection of the Si for the backscattering monochromator to improve the energy resolution. 3 scattering vectors allowing to select three unequivalent acoustic branches close to Γ point of the first Brillouin zone were measured at 6 different temperatures. Only the transverse acoustic branch along ΓX exhibits a softening of ~25(5)% between 300K and 80K (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) . Such softening, was also observed in another iron-based related arsenide : BaFe2As2. In this compound, the softening of ~20% was associated to the magneto-elastic coupling, and was followed at lower temperature by a huge hardening [Parshall15]. Unfortunately, our experimental configuration did not allowed us to measure at lower temperature than 80K. To conclude on the origin of this phonon softening and check also what happens at the superconducting transition, more measurements is highly desirable.</p><p>[Subedi08] <ref type="bibr">Subedi &amp; al;</ref><ref type="bibr">Phys.
