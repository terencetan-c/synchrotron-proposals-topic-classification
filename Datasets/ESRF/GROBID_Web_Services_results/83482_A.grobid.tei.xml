<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Background CeO2 nanoparticles (CNP) are actively investigated as promising antioxidant agent with possible applications in the therapy of a number of pathologies associated to free radicals or oxidative stress. The proposed mechanisms by which CeO2 displays its activity is the scavenging of free radicals, associated to the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox equilibrium. However, up to now, a direct proof of this rationale is still lacking. In a previous XANES experiment, carried out at BM08 (CH4478), we have been able to observe an the ncrease in the amount of Ce(III) in cell internalized CNP. A more recent experiment, carried out at ID21 (CH4716) using µXRF and Ce-L III -edge µ-XANES, we evidenced for the first time a dependence of CNP oxidation state on their intracellular distribution <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Aim of the proposed experiment is to further analyze the CeO 2 intracellular transformations by following over time and in situ the Ce oxidation state by performing pulsechase experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample preparation</head><p>HeLa cells were grown on Si3N4 membranes and treated with CNP. After 1h of incubation (pulse), cells were washed to remove the unattached CNP and the internalized CNP were left for the following 2 and 6 hours (chase). The samples were then freeze-dryed and stored at -80°C. For the X-ray synchrotron analysis, the samples were mounted in the pre cooled sample holder under LN2-vapors and then immediately inserted into the cryostat. The entire transfer process took less than 2 minutes. Results µXRF and Ce-L III edge µXANES measurements were performed using the scanning X-ray microscope of beamline ID21 at ESRF, equipped with a cryostage, keeping the sample stable at -170 ± 5 °C. The µXRF acquisition was done in hyperspectral mode for which the XRF spectrum for each pixel in the image was registered. All maps were fitted using PyMCA software to obtain the intensity distribution of the elements. The µXANES spectra were acquired in fluorescence mapping mode by scanning the beam with a 0.6 × 0.6 µm 2 step size and a 100 ms dwell time per pixel, using a region of interest selective for Ce L3M4 and L3M5 emission lines, corrected for the detector dead time and normalized by I0. Each map was processed using PyMCA for XANES spectra extraction. The Athena software then was used for background removal and normalization: the pre-edge background was fitted by a straight line and subtracted. The spectra were normalized at the unit absorption coefficient at 200 eV above the edge. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the Ce concentration maps of the sample incubated for 1(pulse), plus 2 or 6 hours (chase). Hot spots correspond to regions where the concentration of Ce is high. However, the presence of Ce is detected everywhere in the region of interest. Ce-L III XANES spectra were extracted from the zones indicated by numbers and are shown together with the maps. It is quite apparent that the spectral shape of the XANES manifold for the sample incubated for 1 hours does not change with position, and is always representative of almost pure CeO 2 with no Ce(III). On the contrary, the sample incubated for the additional 2 or 6 hours shows considerable variations of the spectral shape with position. In particular, the region around 5738 eV shows a significant increase in amplitude if compared to the spectrum of CeO 2 , the increase being larger approaching the hot spot. In addition, a shift in the edge energy positions (as detected from the first maximum in the derivative spectra, not shown here for space reasons) is also detected: these evidence points towards the formation of a considerable amount of Ce(III) in this sample. Assuming that the edge energy position varies linearly with Ce(III) content and averaging the spectra over all the map area, a linear trend of Ce(III) amount vs. time is obtained as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. In summary, our result inequivocally demonstrate that CeO 2 are processed by cells with the formation of Ce(III). References [1] D. Ferraro, I. G. Tredici, P. Ghigna, H. Castillo-Michel, A.
