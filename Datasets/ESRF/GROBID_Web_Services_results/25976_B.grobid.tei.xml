P. (2004).</p><p>Optimisation of electrostatic surface potential as strategies for cold adaptation of Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) from cod (Gadus morhua). J. <ref type="bibr">Mol. Biol., 343, 1221</ref><ref type="bibr">-1230.</ref> Cold-adapted enzymes are characterised by an increased catalytic efficiency and reduced temperature stability compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Lately, it has been suggested that an optimisation of the electrostatic surface potential is a strategy for cold adaptation for some enzymes. A visualisation of the electrostatic surface potential of cold-adapted uracil-DNA N-glycosylase (cUNG) from Atlantic cod indicates a more positively charged surface near the active site compared to human UNG (hUNG). In order to investigate the importance of the altered surface potential for the cold-adapted features of cod UNG, six mutants have been characterised and compared to cUNG and hUNG. The cUNG quadruple mutant (V171E, K185V, H250Q and H275Y) and four corresponding single mutants all comprise substitutions of residues present in the human enzyme. A human UNG mutant, E171V, comprises the equivalent residue found in cod UNG. In addition, crystal structures of the single mutants V171E and E171V have been determined. Results from the study show that a more negative electrostatic surface potential reduces the activity and increases the stability of cod UNG, and suggest an optimisation of the surface potential as a strategy for cold-adaptation of this enzyme. Val171 in cod UNG is especially important in this respect.</p><p>2. Helland, R., Larsen, A.N., Smalås, A.O. and Willassen, N.P. ( <ref type="formula">2006</ref>) The 1.8 Å crystal structure of a Proteinase K like enzyme from a psychrotroph Serratia species. FEBS J. ,273, 61-71.</p><p>Proteins from organisms living in extreme conditions are of particular interest because of their potential for being templates for redesign of enzymes both in biotechnological and other industries. The crystal structure of a proteinase K-like enzyme from a psychrotroph Serratia species has been solved to 1.8 A. The structure has been compared with the structures of proteinase K from Tritirachium album Limber and Vibrio sp. PA44 in order to reveal structural explanations for differences in biophysical properties. The Serratia peptidase shares around 40 and 64% identity with the Tritirachium and Vibrio peptidases, respectively. The fold of the three enzymes is essentially identical, with minor exceptions in surface loops. One calcium binding site is found in the Serratia peptidase, in contrast to the Tritirachium and Vibrio peptidases which have two and three, respectively. A disulfide bridge close to the S2 site in the Serratia and Vibrio peptidases, an extensive hydrogen bond network in a tight loop close to the substrate binding site in the Serratia peptidase and different amino acid sequences in the S4 sites are expected to cause different substrate specificity in the three enzymes. The more negative surface potential of the Serratia peptidase, along with a disulfide bridge close to the S2 binding site of a substrate, is also expected to contribute to the overall lower binding affinity observed for the Serratia peptidase. Clear electron density for a tripeptide, probably a proteolysis product, was found in the S' sites of the substrate binding cleft.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Edward Hough, Arne O.
