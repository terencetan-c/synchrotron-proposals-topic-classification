<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Sonia Fieulaine, Sylvie Nessler (0.75 shift): structure of HPr Kinase/Phosphorylase (HprK/P)</p><p>In year 2000, a first native data set had been collected on ID14-1 of 24/02/00 to 2.8Å resolution with crystals of the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P. A MAD data set collected on ID14-4 of 22/09/00 using the selenomethionine modified form of the protein allowed us to solve the first structure of HprK/P.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieulaine et al. (2001) EMBO J., 20, 3917-3927. PDB ID code: 1jb1</head><p>Latter on, a data set collected on ID14-1 of 07/04/02 allowed us to solve by molecular replacement the structure of the complex between the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P and B. subtilis HPr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieulaine et al. (2002) PNAS, (accepted). PDB ID code: 1kkl</head><p>During the run ID14-4 of 14/09/01 we collected data that allowed us to solve the structure the complex between the phosphorylated form of B. subtilis HPr and the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieulaine et al. (2002) PNAS, (accepted) PDB ID code: 1kkm</head><p>During this run, we tested crystals of the complex obtained in presence of PPPi, an alternative phosphate donor for HprK/P. In the complex cocrystallized with PPi (PDB code 1kkm) one phosphate was transferred to Ser-46 of HPr while the second phosphate remained in the active site of the enzyme, at the position usually occupied by beta phosphate of nucleotide bound to P-loop. We hope that the structure obtained with PPPi could show changes induced in the kinase by the phosphate equivalent to the alpha phosphate of the nucleotide. The crystals diffracted to 3Å resolution but were twisted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Luc Bousset, Nicolas Fay (0.75 shift): Structures of Ure2p with inhibitors</head><p>Ure2p is a protein involved in the regulation of nitrogen catabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has prion properties in that it adopts at least two conformations one of which converts the normal form into an abnormal form that assembles into protein fibrils. The crystal structures of Ure2p domain that extends from amino acid residue 94 to 354 alone and in complex with glutathione and related compounds were solved recently at the ESRF. We synthesised a novel set of drugs that affect the assembly of Ure2p into fibrils. To better understand the mechanism of action of these ligands we crystallised Ure2p 95-354 in the presence of the ligands and tested the crystals for diffraction on ID29 on February 23 using 0.75 of a shift. The crystals of Ure2p95-354 made in the presence of an inhibitor of assembly diffracted to 2.8Å but lacked the inhibitor indicating either that the inhibitor is not bound at all or not in a stable manner to Ure2p95-354. Thus, we need to test Ure2p95-354 crystals made in the presence of higher concentrations of the inhibitor of assembly or to find conditions where full-length Ure2p crystals are produced in the presence of the ligand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benoit Gigant, Marcel Knossow (1.5 shifts) : Structure of the tubulin-stathmin complex</head><p>During this session a di (Pt)-ethylene diamine derivative crystal was used to collect anomalous diffraction data at the Pt peak wavelength (λ = 1.072 Å), using a very narrow beam to diminish the effect of mosaicity on the diffraction pattern as much as practically possible. The crystal diffracts to 3.8 Å (Rmerge : 0.077) and data are useful to 4.5 -4 Å. This, together with other derivatives mostly collected on ID14-4, is used to calculate an experimental map from which the molecular replacement model is being rebuilt. The status of this is described together with the report on our 15/6-16/6 visit on ID14-4.</p></div>		</body>
