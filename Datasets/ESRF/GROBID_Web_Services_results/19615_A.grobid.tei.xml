<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of the 4f-5d interaction in La and Ce intermetallics The purpose of these experiments was to compare the RIXS signal from equivalent lanthanum and cerium intermetallics. As is well known Ce intermetallics are mostly mixed valent. RIXS experiments performed at the Ce L 3 -edge are able to pick out structure related to the "f 0 ", "f 1 ", "f 2 " final states quite unambiguously. Such 2p3d RIXS experiments are complex to interpret, however, because of the difficulty of treating the interactions between f and conduction electrons. So far we had established that the behaviour of the "f 2 "part of the RIXS spectrum is quite different according to whether extended states are involved in the hybridization with the conduction states (eg in Ce-Si and Ce-Ge) or whether d states are involved. Our interpretation of the data is that quadrupole transitions are not responsible for the structure observed. In the current experiments, therefore we compared data taken at the La L 3 -edge and the Ce L 3 -edge for equivalent Ni-based intermetallics. The advantage of examining comparable La systems lies in the fact that a simpler basis set may be used to model the RIXS data. As can be seen from figures 1 and 2, there is a very close resemblance between the La and Ce spectra with two dispersing peaks one corresponding to the "f 0 " related states and the other to the "f 1 "related states (La) or "f 1 " and "f 2 "state (Ce). The relative intensity of the «f 1 » peak is very dependent on the Ni environment. By suitably modeling the RIXS process and applying the Gunnarsson and Schönhammer approach we are able to demonstrate that quadrupole transitions are not responsible for the so-called "f 1 " peak and that the RIXS experiment can be used to estimate the "f 0 "/"f 1 " in an analogue fashion to the XPS 3d measurements.</p><p>The advantage of the RIXS experiment over XPS is that it is clearly a probe of bulk properties. Also RIXS reflects an excited state of the atom whereas in XPS the atom is ionized in the final state. We are presently working on a model to describe the Ce data and ascertain if it is possible to extract a set of parameters relevant to the hybridization of f-orbitals and conduction states. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Laboratoire de Chimie Physique: Matière et Rayonnement (UMR7614) Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris Report:</figDesc></figure>
