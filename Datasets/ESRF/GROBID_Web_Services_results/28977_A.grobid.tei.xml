<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPORT ON PROJECT 30-02-683 ''EXAFS investigation of the chemical forms of naturally occurring Zn in soils''</head><p>The aim of the project 30-02-683 was to complete an EXAFS investigation of the chemical forms of naturally occurring Zn in soils developed over Zn geochemical anomalies. Studying these natural systems where Zn has been interacting with soil components for thousands to millions years should allow to depict bio-mineralogical processes that can drive Zn speciation on a large-time scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>Due to lack of time, only two soil profiles, over the three initially selected, have been studied. Three clayey fractions (0.2-2 µm) from the A-, B-and C-horizon and one bulk (&lt; 2 mm) fraction from the B-horizon were studied for the first soil profile (Ardèche). Because clayey fractions were missing at the moment of the EXAFS experiments, silty fractions (2-20 µm) from the A-and B-horizon and from two specific horizons (containing either phosphate or ferric centimetric nodules) were studied for the second soil profile (Morvan).</p><p>In addition, Zn sorbed onto ferrihydrite, onto goethite (FeOOH) and onto birnessite (MnO 2 ), as well as a Znphosphate (hopeite, ZnPO 4 ), were also analyzed as reference compounds.</p><p>EXAFS data were recorded at the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) at cryogenic temperature (10K), with a monochromator equipped with two Si(220) crystals. For dilute soil samples and Zn sorption reference compounds, EXAFS data were collected in fluorescence mode using a Ge 13-elements detector. A 3T V filter was used to damp the fluorescence of Fe for soil samples (up to 8 wt% Fe) and for sorption samples onto Fe (hydr)oxides, whereas a 3T Ti filter was used to damp Mn fluorescence for sorption sample onto birnessite. No filter was used to attenuate the Rayleigh scattering. Due to its large amount of Zn, the Zn-phosphate reference compound was analyzed in transmission mode. Between 3 and 10 scans were recorded for each sample, depending on Zn concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data quality</head><p>For all samples studied, glitches above 11.5 Å -1 prevent a long k-range analysis of EXAFS data as it is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the 0.2-2 µm fraction of the A-horizon from the first soil profile (Ardèche). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First soil profile (Ardèche)</head><p>For the first soil profile (Ardèche), the quality of the EXAFS data is good <ref type="bibr">(Figures 2A and 2B)</ref>. Preliminary comparison between samples studied indicates that Zn speciation is similar in the 0.2-2 µm fractions from Aand B-horizon and in the bulk sample from B-horizon, whereas it seems to differ in the 0.2-2 µm fractions from C-horizon (Figures <ref type="figure">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). On k 3 χ(k) spectra, this difference can be seen around 4 Å -1 where a beat pattern is observed for A-and B-horizons and not for the C-horizon, and after 7 Å -1 where oscillations of the C-horizon are shifted compared to those of A-and B-horizons (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). On RDFs, this difference is evidenced by the occurrence of four peaks around 1.60, 2.70, 3.80 and 5.55 Å (uncorrected for phase shift) for A-and B-horizons, whereas the C-horizon exhibits only three peaks around 1.45, 3.35 and 5.00 Å (uncorrected for phase shift) (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).  Detailed analysis of EXAFS data is still in progress, but a preliminary observation can already been drawn. The inverse Fourier transform of the peak related to the second-neighbours shell (around 2.70 Å, uncorrected for phase shift) on the RDFs of A-and B-horizons (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>) yields a partial k 3 χ(k) spectra which can be related to "light" elements with a maximum at low k values (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</p><p>Further comparisons with model compounds, as well as, changes in EXAFS signal after various chemical treatments (exchangeable Zn, Zn bound to organic matter or to amorphous or crystalline iron oxides, Zncarbonate and Zn-phosphate), will help to identify actual Zn speciation along this soil profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Second soil profile (Côte d'Or)</head><p>For the second soil profile (Côte d'Or), the quality of the EXAFS data is quite low (Figures <ref type="figure">3A</ref> and <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). This poor signal/noise ratio is related to the fact that the beam displaced on the samples during EXAFS scans with the same order of magnitude (20 µm) than single grains constituting the samples (fraction 2-20 µm). Handgrinding of the samples in an agate mortar failed at reducing enough the size of single grains so as to avoid such artefact.</p><p>Preliminary comparison between samples indicates that Zn speciation is different in the 2-20 µm fractions of E-horizon, Bt-horizon and the two horizons containing Fe or PO 4 nodules <ref type="bibr">(Figures 3A and 3B)</ref>. This change at the scale of the soil profile can also be observed at the scale of the specific horizon containing Fe nodules where Zn speciation is different between the 2-20 µm fraction and the separate Fe nodules (Figures <ref type="figure">4A</ref> and <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).   The k 3 χ(k) spectra of the E-horizon is very similar to those of A-and B-horizons from the first soil profile (Ardèche) (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>), which suggest a similar speciation for Zn. However, comparison of the RDFs indicates that this similarity is not so obvious and emphasizes the importance of further EXAFS data analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">5B</ref>).    The k 3 χ(k) spectra of the Bt-horizon is very well structured (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) and the RDF exhibits a very intense peak around 3.60 Å (uncorrected for phase shift) related to the second-neighbours shell around central Zn (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). The first-neighbours peak of this sample is located around 1.90 Å (uncorrected for phase shift), which is two long for Zn-O linkage and indicate rather Zn-S bounds within this sample. Comparison of EXAFS data of this sample with those of reference compounds strongly suggests that Zn occurs as Zn sulfides in the Bt horizon of this soil profile (Figures <ref type="figure">6A</ref> and <ref type="figure">6B</ref>).</p><p>The k 3 χ(k) spectra and the RDFs of the two horizons containing Fe or PO 4 nodules are very similar which suggest that Zn speciation is the same in these two samples <ref type="bibr">(Figures 3A and 3B)</ref>.</p><p>Actual speciation of Zn in all samples studied, but the Bt-horizon of the second soil profile (Côte d'Or), has not been yet identified. Data analysis is still in progress. Shell-by-shell analysis will be used to depict Zn neighbouring in each sample studied. Experimental EXAFS spectra will be fitted by a linear combination of EXAFS spectra of selected reference compounds to yield quantitative speciation of Zn in all samples investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : (top) I 0 signal and (bottom) EXAFS spectra of 0.2-2 µm fraction of A-horizon from Ardèche soi profile.</figDesc></figure>
