<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The ability to individually adress molecula r centres on a surface is a requirement for future device implimentation of molecular systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> One way to achieve such control is through coupling between local electric fields and the magnetic moment of single molecules. Such a coupling is possible in molecules which display the magnetoelectric effect, where the absence of inversion symmtry leads to efficient coupling of the magnetic moment of individual molecules and the local magnetic field. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> One way to check that there is an efficient coupling between small local electric fields and the magnetic moment of the molecule is through the observation of MagnetoChiral Dichroism (MChiD). We have previously measured (CH-5357) X-ray MagnetoChiral Dichroism (XMChiD) on Na5[Ho(ODA)3](BF4)26(H2O), where ODA 2-= oxydiacetate, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The XMChiD signal was observable at the L3-edge of Ho, but it was weaker than anticipated for a 4f system. This is possibly due to the very localised 4f electrons which are little affected by the chirality of the surrounding ligand scaffold, thus giving rise to a small XMChiD signal. In order to obtain a larger XMChiD signal we sought to increase the hybridisatio n between the 4f and 5d orbitals, since the 5d orbitals have a larger radial extension than the 4f orbitals and are thereby more affected by the chiral ligand environment. In Eu(II) the admixture between the 5d and 4f orbitals should be larger than for any Ln(III) ion. Therefore, we sought to measure XMChiD on single crystals of the resolved Eu(II) complex EuI2( i PrNH2)4 ( i PrNH2 = isopropylamine). Due to the inherent air-and moisture sensitivity of the titled Eu(II) complexes, measurements of the XMChiD of these complexes was not possible. Instead it was decided to measure on Na5[Dy(ODA)3](BF4)26(H2O) and Na5[Gd(ODA)3](BF4)26(H2O) in order to get further information about the XMChiD of molecular lanthanide systems. Here Gd(III) is interesting as it has a ground multiplet without orbital angular momentum. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Na5[Ln(ODA)3](BF4)26(H2O) crystallises in the trigona l spacegroup R32 as large (3mm x 3mm x 1mm) hexagons. Upon crystallisation the complexes resolve in a Δ or Λ configuration, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction the chirality of each crystal was checked at The Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen prior to the beamtime. For the measurements of XMChiD it is important to have crystals with similar amplitudes of the Xray Natural Circular Dichroism (XNCD), therefore, the XNCD in zero magnetic field was measured for 4 crystals (two of each chirality Δ or Λ) for both the Dy and Gd complexes, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In the following the results obtained on Na5[Dy(ODA)3](BF4)26(H2O) (1) will be discussed as the Gd data are still being evaluated. All the measureme nts on 1 were performed at 2.7 K if not stated otherwise.</p><p>All four crystals of 1 showed an XNCD of similar magnitude, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. For the subsequent measurements of the X-ray Magneto Circular Dichroism (XMCD) and XMChiD at the L2-and L3-edges of Dy, crystals 3 and 4 were chosen as their XNCD intensities were comparable, and crystal 4 did not show the same artifacts at 7835 eV as crystal 2. It should be mentioned that during the beamtime much time was used to orient the crystals properly such that diffraction peaks in the XANES were avoided. Additionally, we also observed radiation damage in the beginning of the beamtime, but by minimizing the intens ity of the X-ray beam to a minimum the radiation damage was avoided.</p><p>In our previous measurements on Na5[Ho(ODA)3](BF4)26(H2O) the same degree of radiation damage was not observed. We attribute this to the fact that the beamline at ID 12 was upgraded since our previous visit. XMCD and XNCD at 2 T were measured at both the L2-and L3-edges of Dy, see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> for the measurements at the L2edge. The XNCD spectra of crystals of opposite chirality should be mirror images of each other. This is the case in the present measurements above 8595 eV, but not below. We believe that this is due to artifacts in the crystals. The observed XMChiD spectra of 1 at both the L2-and L3edges were much more noisy than for the analogous Ho system. Unfortunately, we did not see a clear sign of XMChiD in 1, neither at the L2-nor L3-edge. This is for instance seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, where we do not observe a clear mirroring of the XMChiD signal of the Δ and Λ complexes of 1. In addition to measurements at 2 T for 1-Δ and 1-Λ measurements were also performed at 7 T for 1-Λ at the Dy L3-edge. This was done since 1 at 2 K switches its anisotropy from easy axis to easy plane at 3 T. These measureme nts were performed to see how the XMCD and XMChiD changes when the anisotropy axis of the complex changes. No significant change was observed.  8560 8580 8600 8620 8640 8660 -0.030 -0.025 -0.020 -0.015 -0.010 -0.005 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 XMCD and XNCD / a.u.
