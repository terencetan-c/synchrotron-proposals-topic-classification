<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have conducted 9-shift beamtime at ESRF and accomplished four related projects. After the experiment, we submitted one manuscript and it was now under review by Science Bulletin. We also finished two manusciprts that will be submitted soon. In addition, we collected very promising results on FeF3 but may need additional experiment to finish it in the next run. The results are summarizd below. We would like to mention that within 9 shifts beamtime, at least 3 manuscripts have be produced and we also have the chance to resolve a long-pursuit question in Earth sciences. ESRF beamline scientsts will be co-authors in all the abovementioned works.</p><p>1. We discovered a high-pressure hexagonal structured Fe3F phase at above 200 GPa. This is the main results fully matching our proposal. We found oxygen can partially or fully replace the site of F to make Fe3(F, O). An XRD pattern obtained at ESRF is shown below (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The results can explain the density deficiency in the core.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" /><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2.</head><figDesc>We submitted a manuscript titled "Evidence for scattered water transportation spots in the midlower mantle" and was curently under review by Science Bulletin. This work uncovered the water storage in the mid-lower mantle by combined XRD, electrical conductivity and seismic velocity experiment in iron oxide. Dr. Gaston Garbarino is a co-author of this work. The abstract is pasted below: "Water in Earth's transition zone and the core-mantle boundary plays a key role in its stratification, volatile cycling, and core formation. If water transportation is sustained between the aforementioned layers, the lower mantle should contain water channels with distinctive seismic and/or electromagnetic signatures. Here, we investigated the electrical conductivity and sound velocity of ε-FeOOH up to 70 GPa and 1800 K and compared results with global tomography data. A 3-order abrupt jump of electrical conductivity was observed above 50 GPa, reaching 1.24±0.19 × 103 S/m at 61 GPa. Meanwhile, longitudinal sound velocity dropped by ~20% in responding to the high-tolow spin transition of Fe3+. The high-conductivity and low-sound velocity of ε-FeOOH reproduce the seismic wave scatterings in the mid-lower mantle. Such unique properties of hydrous ε-FeOOH, or possibly other Fe-enriched phases can be detected as evidences for active water transportation in the mid-lower mantle."</figDesc></figure>

<div><head>4.</head><p>We are preparing a manuscript titled "Mixed water storage mechanism the stability of ultrahydrous SiO2" and plan to submitted to a geophyical journal by the end the year. Here, we verified the exisiting problem on the phas transition boundary of hydrous stishovite. We also revealed the water incorportation mechanism through combined single-crystal XRD and first-principles simulations. <rs type="person">Dr. Davide Comboni</rs> and <rs type="person">Dr. Michael Hanfland</rs> from <rs type="funder">ESRF</rs> will be co-authors.</p></div>
