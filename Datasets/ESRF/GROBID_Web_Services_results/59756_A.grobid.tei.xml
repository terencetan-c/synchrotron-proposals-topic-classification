<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HC2548 STATIC MEASUREMENTS</head><p>We had large intensities (but low coherence!). Results from circular averages of the measured intensity around the (1/2 1/2 1/2) superstructure peak were used to estimate Tc and to observe the critical scattering. These averages were fitted in the usual manner: a lorentzian-squared behaviour for the smaller q-values and a near-lorentzian shape for diffuse scattering: I(q)=A/(1+(q/q0) 2 ) 2 +S(0)/(1+(q) 1.967 ) Data used provides very precise estimates of the transition temperatures and comparing the results obtained show a very high sample stability in a 24 hours period. S(0) corresponds to the susceptibilty. As S(0)α(|T-Tc|/Tc)^-1.241, S(0)</p><p>-.806 is linear in temperature (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and 2 showing</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE DYNAMICS OBSERVED</head><p>For each temperature, we have time series, usually 40,000 frames, and the period was either 0.05 s or 0.02s. The Yuryi's (ID10) python program was used, with three different sets of q-vectors.</p><p>I conclude here: -For very small angles, there is usually a large pretransitional peak, which is strongly temperature dependent. Though the stability was of the order of a few mK, this peak is not fully stable and its variations for t&gt;20-30s makes impossible to distinguish a fluctuation time from temperature instabilities. No reliable result is thus obtained for q&lt;0.0005 Å -1 (it is a ~5pixels radius).</p><p>-For larger angles, no fluctations are observed for q&gt;0.00515 Å -1 (too fast for the minimum 0.02 s measuring time). It was checked for large time series and a large number of pixels that the correlation function was essentially 1. Shorter measuring times are necessary.</p><p>-We have reliable measurements in a one order of magnitude range of q (From 0.0005 to 0.005Å -1 ).</p><p>The correlations, after averaging on time and on pixels and after normalization are written: Fig 1: Fit of S(0) -0.806 12:00 Monday. The linear fit yields Tc=336.016(18)°C</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(q,t)=1++*exp(-t/(q))</formula><p>Only for larger angles the prepeak contribution is small, and it is in this region that we obtain the low value~0.015-0.02, ~0.1-0.2 is due to anisotropic parasitic scattering. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> are shown the correlation functions observed at 336.025°C for the largest angles. The fluctuation time  is well estimated, and we also check the remarquable stability of the beamline.</p><p>We have 13 temperatures, and we obtain a set of τ(q,Τ). The results are gathered in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. In the same figure, the result of fits with the equation: (q,T)=  (T)/(1+(q/q0) 2 ) are plotted</p><p>This equation provides an estimate of 0(T) for the various temperatures. In  Fig. 4-The fluctuation times vs q at various temperatures (notice the logarithmic axes)</p><p>This estimate of zyields (=0.631) z=1.99( <ref type="formula">13</ref>), which agrees with the theoretical value (z~2.03), with a poor precision.</p><p>-We can have a better coherence, and reduce the noise from pre-peaks by closing slits horizontally.</p><p>-We can have a better management of the prepeak intensity (dependent on the BM2 experiment) -We have to better the exploration of the reciprocal lattice in the vicinity of the Bragg position by slightly moving the detector apart: with a small misorientation, some q-values have a larger set of pixels. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig 2: Fit of S(0) -.806 around 6:00 Thuesday: the linear fit yields 336.017(5)°C</figDesc><graphic coords="1,299.20,188.50,200.90,135.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
