<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Scientists on the beamline were Silvia M. Pietralunga, Hao Chen and Francesco D'Acapito.</p><p>We characterized sub-stoichiometric and amorphous WO3-x compact thin films, synthesized by non-reactive radiofrequency (RF) sputtering from WO3 targets, according to Ref. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The stoichiometry of as-deposited films had been modified by subsquent 8-hours thermal annealing in different conditions and atmospheres (dry air, N2, and vacuum). Annealing temperatures had been chosen below and above crystallization thresholds, according to the atmosphere and the expected stoichiometry. Crystallization was checked at home institutions by XRD and SEM imging. Films were crystallized at 400 °C if in air and at 650 °C if either in N2 or in vacuum. Specimens of fully oxidized samples, crystallized in air and e-beam irradiated for stoichiometry reduction, were also measured.</p><p>The goal of EXAFS investigation was to highlight differences in the local structure and coordination of differently prepared WO3-x films. Measurements were performed at W-L3 edge (10207 eV), with the energy ranging from 10006 eV to 11000 eV, thus covering both XANES and EXAFS. Data was collected at room temperature in low vacuum and at low temperature (80 Kelvin) in high vacuum. Energy dependence of absorption coefficient 𝜇(𝐸) was recorded in fluorescence mode, 𝜇(𝐸) = 𝐼 ! 𝐼 " ⁄ , where 𝐼 " is the X-ray beam intensity before sample and 𝐼 ! is the intensity of fluorescence after sample. In order to minimize the contribution from the substrate, the focused X-ray beam was at grazing incidence (45 degrees). The interpretation of data is supported by characterizions performed at home institutions, including morphological, optical, structural, chemical and electrical properties.</p><p>Collected data was cleaned from background and normalized by Athena program of Demeter software package, so that the data become independent of details of measuring configuration or detector setup. The cleaned data expresses energy-dependent absorption coefficient as 𝜒(𝐸) = [𝜇(𝐸) -𝜇 " (𝐸)] Δ𝜇 " (𝐸) ⁄ , where 𝜇 " (𝐸) represents background absorption and Δ𝜇 " (𝐸) represents absorption jump at edge energy. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> the top panel shows the EXAFS spectra of WO3-x thin films before and after annealing in different atomspheres, plotted in k space weighted by k 2 . It shows spectral differences between as-deposited (amorphous) thin film and annealed ones (crystallized). The reason that causes this difference may be two-fold. The similarity of EXAFS spectra between crystallized samples annealed in air (monoclinic) and in N2 (triclinic) suggests that the first reason of difference from the as-deposited sample might be the reorganization of structure into an ordered distribution of atoms. From this similarity we may also infer that small stoichiometric differences may occur between the two crystallized samples but under the sensitivity of EXAFS. Actually, from optical and electrical measurements it is expected that annealing in air leads to more stoichiometric samples. Differences of the order of 𝑥 = 0.1 in WO3-x can already induce significant changes in optical and electrical properties and yet still be not recorded by EXAFS. But if the compositional difference increases, as is the case for the sample annealed in vacuum, where structural measurements tell that WO2 forms, the EXAFS plot is clearly different. This large compositional change makes up the second contribution of previously mentioned difference.</p><p>Regarding the e-beam irradiated samples, which are expected to be chemically reduced but up to an unknown degree, EXAFS spectra are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and look quite similar to non-irradiated sample. We deem it to be under EXAFS sensitivity for the stoichiometric changes by the applied e-beam irradiation dose, so that nothing significant can be inferred from the present results, concerning possible variations in local coordination induced by e-beam irradiation. More effettive e-beam treatments should be put in place, to address EXAFS analysis in a further experimental session.</p><p>Fourier transformed radial distance distribution is depicted in the bottom panels of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. Fourier transform range was 3 Å -1 ~10.8 Å -1 , but higher wavenumbers are not included because of poor data detection, due to unknown reasons. In the first-shell (1 Å ~ 2 Å) two main peaks are evident, meaning two main W-O bond distances, and their relative magnitude is modified in dependence of annealing conditions. Fitting over the extended shells has proven to be quite difficult and work is still in progress.</p><p>[1] H.

The total coordination number in the first shell is set to Ntotal = 6 and two different paths are used, respectively representing short and long W-O distances. Fitting result shows that the short W-O distance is dominant in as-deposited sample (N = 4 for short W-O distance and N = 2 for long W-O distance) and this remains after annealing in air and in N2. Instead, by annealing in vacuum, the preference is switched to long W-O distance (N = 2 for short W-O distance and N = 4 for long W-O distance).</figDesc></figure>
