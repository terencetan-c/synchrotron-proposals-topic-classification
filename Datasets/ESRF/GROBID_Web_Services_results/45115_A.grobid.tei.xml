<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was the in situ investigation of the effect of the thermal treatment on the microstructure of electrodeposited (ED) Co/Cu multilayers (MLs) with GMR effect. A series of samples with constant layer thickness was deposited using the single bath method under different current densities. The current density is expected to affect strongly the amount of copper codeposited during the deposition of cobalt and consequently the microstructure of the ED MLs. As in situ methods, symmetrical WAXS and EXAFS were used. WAXS described the microstructure evolution during annealing; EXAFS revealed details on intermixing of the codeposited species.</p><p>The isothermal WAXS measurements showed a high thermal stability of the ED MLs up to 200°C. In samples prepared at high current densities, copper segregated after annealing at temperatures exceeding 350°C as seen on the formation of a distinct diffraction line from Cu in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. This was accompanied by an improvement of the multilayer satellites these samples. The samples deposited at low current densities contained hdp Co, which disappeared during the annealing up to 500°C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) and did not occurred more upon cooling.</p><p>a)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">27</formula><p>28 29 30 31 32 33 Intensity [arb. units] 2θ [°] θ [°] θ [°] θ [°] 25°C 500°C, 1.5h b) 28 30 32 25°C before annealing 25°C after annealing Intensity [arb. units] Selected samples were subjected to EXAFS measurements. The intention of these measurements was to describe the local chemical environment of Co and to identify the intermixing or decomposition effects. All samples were measured at the Co-Kβ edge (7700 eV). The background absorption µ 0 (E) has been removed using the Athena program; the Fourier transform χ(E)of the absorption fine structure was loaded into the Artemis program. Both programs are included in the IFeffit package. The analysis of the data was done using the 'model for doped materials' explained by B. Ravel at the 2001 EXAFS workshop [1]. This model calculates the intermixing parameter x. Several other parameters like the relative displacements ∆R of the first neighbours of the absorbing Co atom were used for refinement as well. The resulting fits are shown in Fig. 2. In the sample deposited at high current density (j = 84 mA/cm²), Co is surrounded mainly by Co (x = 0.14). Due to a larger atomic radius of Cu as compared to Co, Cu atoms are shifted in outward direction with respect to the original cell. An opposite shift was observed for Co. The annealing leads to an intermixing of Co and Cu until a random distribution around the Co absorber is achieved (x = 0.57). The intermixing is expected to occur as substitutional occupation of the Wyckoff positions of the fcc cell by Co and Cu, which can be the cause of the vanishing displacement Co hdp (∆R) of Co and Cu for the annealed sample. Lower current deposition density (j = 16 mA/cm²) leads to enhanced intermixing of Co and Cu (x = 0.32). The opposite displacement of Co and Cu persists.
