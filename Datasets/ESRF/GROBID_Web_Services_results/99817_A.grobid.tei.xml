<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this beam time, we investigated the decane/water interface at ESRF beamline ID10 predominantly with grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), while cross-referencing particle immersion and packing with x-ray reflectometry (XRR) to ensure that the experiment is comparable to our previous results. A photon energy of 22 keV was used for best transmission to/from the oil/water interface and the double crystal diffractometer ensured alignment of the beam to the interface. The beam intensity was recorded with the Maxipix detector at 1010 mm distance to the sample. In addition to the regular setup, a manual slit was introduced directly in front of the sample cell for the GISAXS measurements to remove beam background that originated from the diffractometer.</p><p>In order to minimize scattering from the oil phase and from all other components of the sample cell, we designed a customized oil/water cell based on a design that we already tested at DESY in two previous beam times (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). We evaluated monocrystalline CVD diamond (300 µm) and thin mica sheets (27 µm) as window material. Both materials were well suited, but the diamond windows gave an additional reflection that slightly superimposed the GISAXS pattern. Given the huge price difference between the two materials (about 2500 € per diamond window vs 2.50 € per mica window), we opted to continue to work with the mica windows.</p><p>The cell geometry and windows were tailored to accommodate the beam footprint to minimize interaction of the beam with the cell walls. However, the rectangular shape of the new cell was a disadvantage compared to the spherical cell design that we used before because of the complex interfacial meniscus that was introduced by the rectangular walls. While we were able to record very good GISAXS patterns with the new cell, the complex meniscus complicated XRR measurements at very low qz as shown below. After evaluation of the cell setup we were able to carry out most of our planned measurements as described in the original proposal. The experiments were designed around various aqueous nanoparticle dispersions and decane solutions containing lipids at different concentrations. Bare silica nanoparticles (TEOS) with diameters of 20 nm were used as well as the same particles with a coating of 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane (APTES). Octadecyl amine (ODA) was dissolved in the decane phase with varying concentrations from 0.01 mM to 1 mM. The following measurements were carried out:</p><p>1. Initial alignment and adjustment of the cell and confirmation of the experimental setup quality by recording one complete XRR curve of the sample containing pure water and decane only. Evaluating and optimizing the sample environment for GISAXS measurements 2. One complete XRR curve with APTES particles and ODA at a fixed concentration, including radiation damage checks 2. static measurements: GISAXS reciprocal space maps for four ODA concentrations (fixed particle concentration) for both APTES and TEOS particles 3. time-resolved experiments: hourly XRR and GISAX measurements for four ODA concentrations (fixed particle concentration) for both APTES and TEOS particles At least two samples of each type were prepared and studied to confirm the reproducibility of the results. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows selected results from GISAXS. On the GISAXS patterns, the emergence of an hexagonal packing of APTES particles at the oil/water interface could be observed with increasing concentrations of ODA. At the highest ODA concentration, the 2 nd order peak becomes less sharp than the one at 0.1mM ODA, suggesting a worse in-plane order. This might be related to the slight hydrophobization of the particles that occurs at the highest surfactant concentration which we also observed at our previous measurements at DESY. The reflectivity of the same samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) clearly shows increasing amounts of interfacially adsorbed nanoparticles with increasing surfactant concentrations, which corresponds to what we expect from this system. Note the irregularities at low Qz which are particularly visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref> and which are most likely caused by the complex interfacial meniscus inside our cell and possibly also background radiation from the diffractometer, which make quantitative analysis of the XRR data difficult. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Photograph of the sample cell.
