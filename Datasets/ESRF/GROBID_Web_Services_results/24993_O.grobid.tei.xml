<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) is an outer-mitochondrial membrane enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of arylalkylmine neurotrasmitters. The crystal structures of MAO B in complex with four of the Npropargylaminoindan class of MAO covalent inhibitors (rasagiline, N-propargyl-1(S)-aminoindan, 6hydroxy-N-propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan and N-methyl-N-propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan) have been determined at a resolution better than 2.1 Å.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan adopt essentially the same conformation with the extended propargyl chain covalently bound to the flavin and the indan ring located in the rear of the substrate cavity. N-propargyl-1(S)aminoindan binds with the indan ring in a flipped conformation with respect to the other inhibitors, which causes a slight movement of the Tyr326 side chain. Four ordered water molecules are an integral part of the active site and establish H-bond interactions to the inhibitor atoms. These structural studies may guide future drug-design to improve selectivity and efficacy by introducing appropriate substituents on the rasagiline molecular scaffold. Monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that oxidizes arylalkylamine neurotransmitters and has been a valuable drug target for many neurological disorders. The 1.7 Å resolution structure of human MAO B shows the enzyme is dimeric with a C-terminal trans-membrane helix protruding from each monomer and anchoring the protein to the membrane. This helix departs perpendicularly from the base of the structure in a different way with respect to other monotopic membrane proteins. Several apolar loops exposed on the protein surface are located in proximity of the C-terminal helix, providing additional membrane binding interactions. One of these loops (residues 99-112) also functions in opening and closing the MAO B active site cavity, which suggests that the membrane may have a role in controlling substrate binding. </p></div>

J. Medicinal Chemistry, 47, 1760-1766. The inactivation of purified human recombinant monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B by rasagiline [Npropargyl-1(R)-aminoindan] and four of its analogues [N-propargyl-1(S)-aminoindan (S-PAI), 6-hydroxy-Npropargyl-1(R)-aminoindan (R-HPAI), N-methyl-N-propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan (R-MPAI) and 6-(Nmethyl,N-ethyl carbamoyloxy)-N-propargyl-1(R)-aminoindan (R-CPAI)] has been investigated. All compounds tested, with the exception of R-CPAI, form stoichiometric N(5) flavocyanine adducts with the FAD moiety of either enzyme. No H 2 O 2 is produced during either MAO A or MAO B inactivation which demonstrates that covalent addition occurs in a single turnover. Rasagiline has the highest specificity for MAO B as demonstrated by a 100-fold higher inhibition potency (k inact /K i ) as compared to MAO A, with the remaining compounds exhibiting lower isozyme specificities. MAO B and MAO A are more selective for the R-enantiomer (rasagiline) as compared to the S-enantiomer (S-PAI) by 2,500-fold and 17-fold, respectively. Differences in UV/VIS and CD spectral data of the complexes of the studied compounds with both MAO A and MAO B are interpreted in light of crystallographic data of complexes of MAO B with rasagiline and its analogues Abstract of the article: Binda, C., Li, M., Hubálek, F., Edmondson, D.E., Mattevi, A.
