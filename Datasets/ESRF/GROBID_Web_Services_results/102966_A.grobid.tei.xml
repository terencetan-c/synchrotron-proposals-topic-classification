<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the time at BM 25-SpLine, the first 3 shifts were dedicated to the measurement of X-Ray difractograms of samples that present crystalline and pseudocrystalline structures (a set of 23 samples) in the SixC diffractometer. Powder samples were measured in capillars, without any inconvenience during that time.</p><p>Preliminary results seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> show that, as an example, there are some differences when comparing the XRD patterns obtained at laboratory scale and at the ESRF. Then, it can be observed the presence of additional diffraction peaks that, undoubtedly, will help to understand the phase transition and identify the new structures that undergo upon calcination in solids that present caesium, tungsten and niobium (pseudocrystalline to distored orthorhombic M1 phase). Same results were obtained in catalysts that also present phosphorous in the structure.</p><p>Afterwards, the 9 shifts left were dedicated to HAXPES experiments in samples that present cesium, phosphorous, tungsten and niobium in different proportions and with different activation temperatures.</p><p>In this case, the first part of the experiment was dedicated to the identification of the regions present in the studied sample (in terms of kinetic energy), depending on its composition, and the elucidation of the analysis time, reaching to a compromise between resolution and time. Then, a total amount of 10 samples were measured (two sets of five catalysts).</p><p>During that time, the most relevant issue was due to the nature of the samples. Thus, this type of catalysts based on mixed metal oxides present a heavily marked semiconductor behaviour, so differential charge was observed.</p><p>The solution for this problem was to increase notably the element region in where the measures took place, i.e., a larger kinetic energy range, which also led to a strong increase in the time per sample analysis. In addition to that, this differential charge observed in all the solids analysed made it difficult to stablish a general protocol in terms of number of acquisitions. In any case, this problem was overcome by manually displacing the recorded spectra after the measurement in order to maximize the resolution of the spectra. Nevertheless, interesting results were obtained.</p><p>Preliminary results, as an example, are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. There it is shown the full range HAXPES spectra (survey) of a sample synthesized with caesium, tungsten, niobium and phosphorous in the structure and previously heat-treated at 1000 ºC (it is also the same sample shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, XRD results). Interestingly, all elements have a signal in the HAXPES spectra except for caesium, element that it is present in the conventional XPS spectra recorded in our lab. Then, as a conclusion, it is suggested that caesium is only incorporated in the surface of the structure, being that surface incorporation enough to produce a phase transition upon heattreatment into the orthorhombic phase known as M1.  Further analysis of the spectra, expected in the coming months, will allow to stablish a relationship between crystalline structure and chemical (bulk and surface) composition at different activation temperatures. We would also like to express our most sincere gratitute to the SpLine staff for their interest and hep with the experiment.</p><p>10 20 30 40 Intensity / a.u. 2θ/ degree CsPWNb at 550 ºC CsPWNb at 1000 ºC</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. José Manuel López Nieto*, Instituto de Tecnología Química (UPV-CSIC), Valencia, Spain Dr. José Luis Jordá Moret, Instituto de Tecnología Química (UPV-CSIC), Valencia, Spain Dr. Ester García González, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain Agustín de Arriba Mateos*, Instituto de Tecnología Química (UPV-CSIC), Valencia, Spain Beatriz María Moreno Torralbo*, Instituto de Tecnología Química (UPV-CSIC), Valencia, Spain</figDesc></figure>
