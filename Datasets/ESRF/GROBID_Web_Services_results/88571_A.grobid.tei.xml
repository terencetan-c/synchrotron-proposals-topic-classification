<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the strain effects on the magnon dispersion of the exotic magnetic properties of the large spin orbit driven Mott Insulators Sr2IrO4 and Sr3Ir2O7, with Jeff=1/2 ground state. The experiments were undertaken at the ID20 beamline, RIXS with photon tuned to the Ir L3 absorption edge. The experiment focussed measuring the magnon dispersions for the two compounds at low temperature and comparing the magnon dispersions with the bulk compounds. Below we report on the results from. the two compounds separately -Part I: Sr2IrO4 Results and Part II: Sr3Ir2O7 Results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part I: RIXS on Sr2IrO4 Thin films.</head><p>The thin film investigated was 108nm thick and previous results from the XMaS beamline indicate that the film was completely strained. During the experiment we found that the RIXS at the Ir L3 edge was strong enough to measure the magnon dispersion across the entile Brilloun zone, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> below. Interestingly, we find that the magnon energies are reduced for the thin film compared to the bulk, consistent with strain tuning of the magnon properties. Modelling the magnon dispersion is currently in progress using the Spin-W package.</p><p>Part II: RIXS on Sr3Ir2O7 Thin Films. Thin epitaxial films of Sr3Ir2O7 are notoriusly difficult to fabricate compared to the Sr2IrO4 system. This is because they have a minute parameter space for growth in terms of temperature and pressure to stabilize the corrrect stoichiometry. Thanks to stringent effors by our growers at the Walther Meissner institute, we have managed to fabricate stoichiometric and strained thin films of Sr3Ir2O7, which to our knowlege are almost unique globally. We have measured the magnon dispersion on a 61nm thick film at 20K using RIXS and we succeeded to determine the magnon dispersion across the entire Brillouin zone and compare the results to those taken on the bulk compound <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. we compare the energy scans from film and bulk single crystal at the wavevector Q=(5 0 2). The observed peaks are labelled A,B,C&amp;D, with A the elastic line and B-D magnon branches.</p><p>Note the dramatic shift of the peaks B&amp;D of the film compared to the bulk. This result suggests a dramatic strain tuning of the possible quantum dimer state in our thin films of Sr3Ir2O7. The work is currently undergoing theoretical calculations in collaboration with Tim Ziman of the ESRF theory group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work and publications: Sr2IrO4:</head><p>We have observed some even more dramatic effects in the magnetic structure of Sr2IrO4 films in applied magnetic fields using elastic XRS. We have submitted a continuation proposal to investigate the magnon properties of these fils in applied magnetic field to complete these RIXS measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sr3Ir2O7:</head><p>We have not determined the magnetic structure of the Sr3Ir2O7 thin film using XRS elastic methods. We have submitted a continuation proposal to the XMaS beamline aimed at completing the studies of the magnetic structure, which will for part of a publication on this materials along with the RIXS work. Here it is vital to determine if the magnetic structure is long or. short ranged ordered, in comparison to out results on the Sr2IrO4.</p></div>
