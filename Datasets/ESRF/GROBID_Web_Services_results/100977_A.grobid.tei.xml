<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this project was to investigate the conduction and breakdown mechanisms occurring in local conduction channels of nanocircuits created by a polarized near field tip at otherwise insulating multiferroic spinel MFe2O4 (MFO, M = Co, Ni, Mn and Fe) ferrites / epitaxial BaTiO3(001) (BTO) interfaces. Using local probe X-ray diffraction, we aimed to determine: (i) the changes on the crystalline structure (phase, lattice parameters) following modifications induced by Piezo Force Microscopy (PFM) writing (resistivity changes) and junctions poling, since crystalline phase change is a pre-requisite for resistance changes in our systems;</p><p>(ii) the location of the breakdown and in particular the role of defects like edges between regions of different compositions during breakdown, and (iii) interface effects on the PFM written zone crossing interfaces between 2 different materials.</p><p>We considered 2 types of epitaxial heterostructures, namely Fe2O3 / BaTiO3 and NiFe2O4 / BaTiO3, both grown on Nb (1%) doped SrTiO3(001) single crystalline substrates. These interfaces correspond to 2 extreme situations:</p><p>(1) NiFe2O4 being very difficult to reduce (3-8% resistance change) and (2) Fe2O3 that transforms partially into Fe3O4 which is a conductive semi-metal (75-99% resistance change). All layers were grown by Atomic Oxygen assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy at CEA/Saclay and were single crystalline and well-ordered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Photolithography (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) was used to produce gold leads with different sizes of rectangular openings (1-5 µm). Chemical interface reduction between the leads was realized by positively polarized PFM tip (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). For the in-situ current injection implementation on ID-01 beamline, we built a dedicated montage setup that allowed current injection in the sub-µm scale junction, as well as a facile and efficient switch of samples (5-15 mins). All beamline staff, especially the local contact and beamline engineer, helped us adapt and realize the dedicated sample montage setup.</p><p>For the diffraction measurement, a 10 keV monochromatic X-ray beam was focused using a Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) to about 130 nm × 80 nm (H × V). The spot was ensuring the lateral resolution of the measurement. Using the k-map approach, XY maps consisting of ~ 100×70 points in X and Y direction were measured for different angular positioning of the detector and incident angles (40 -60 combinations), thus resulting in the possibility to reconstruct, at each lateral position, a 3D-Reciprocal Space Map (RSM). These measurements were then performed for the pristine state, several values of the injected current, and up to the complete breakdown of the junction. This allows for a quantitative characterization (extract meaningful parameters as diffraction peak area, peak position, full width at half maximum FWHM, film thickness, etc.) of the changes and quantify the modifications upon the different injected current in the junctions, up to complete breakdown.</p><p>Totally 4 junctions have been investigated. We started with an already broken-down NFO/BTO junction, following an operando EXAFS analysis at SOLEIL-LUCIA beamline (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). We could thus complete the chemistry change (from EXAFS) with crystal structure information. Upon extraction and preliminary processing of data, we identify a clear contrast between two electrodes as well as hot points along the edges of the electrode in the map illustrating the position of BTO diffraction peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), signifying a perpendicularly compressed (in-plane expanded) lattice in the top electrode. In the colormap showing the integrated area of the BTO peak, very clear contrast in the PFM written conduction channel is evidenced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>), which indicates the change of crystalline quality of the BTO triggered by PFM writing or breakdown injection. We then carried out more challenging in-situ current injection experiments on 3 pristine junctions. Two of them are made of Fe2O3/BTO interfaces and poling was realized in different directions, the last one is a NFO/BTO interface with the poling in positive direction only. K-map with reduced angular positions at ferrite and BTO peaks were used to evaluate the junction condition and hence optimize the current steps. All the 3 junctions were thus successfully characterized in pristine, working (increasing current -up to a dozen of situations) and breakdown states, showing both common but also some unique behaviors during the evolution. Here, we illustrate the diffraction data of Fe2O3/BTO junction with positive poling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). In the pristine condition, we can see weak reduced crystalline quality (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) and compressed lattice parameter c (not illustrated) inside the PFM-written channel. The evolution of the junction under current flow manifests not only as the degradation of the crystalline quality in the part where current flows in the lead and the channel but also as the appearance of islands of low crystalline quality near the junction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>, 3c, 3d). These data are still under evaluation. The procedures of sample lateral drift correction during the k-maps (40-60 angular positions) are expected to yield better visualization of the changes and enable their better quantification, namely of the lattice parameter variation with increasing current.</p><p>Overall, the experiment was very successful, and we could acquire the expected evolution of the crystalline structure of ferrite/BTO junctions realized by PFM polarization. The interpretation of crystal structure data acquired on ID-01 beamline will hopefully help us unveil the mechanism on current injection and breakdown in the conduction channel created by PFM in ferrite/BTO epitaxial systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 (a) Typical HRTEM image of Fe2O3/BTO/Nb:STO epitaxial heterostructures.
