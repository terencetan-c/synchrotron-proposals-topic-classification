<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Scans were successfully acquired from osteoderms (small bones within the skin) of 5 species of lizards separated by more than 200 million years of evolution. Scans were taken at 200 µm overview at, 100nm resolution, and 100 µm (fine scale field of view, 50 nm resolution) using phase-contrast holo-tomography. This beam time allowed confirmation of the presence of a cell-poor capping tissue of unknown composition (e.g., Fig1, ic for Broadleysaurus major). This capping tissue is distinct from the underlying bone (Fig1, id), and is overlain by dermis (Fig1, ib) and epidermis. Previous descriptions of the capping tissue relied on microCT and light microscopy, and focused primarily on 2 species (Tarentola and Heloderma) <ref type="bibr">(Williams et al., 2021)</ref>. As a result of our investigation using the current beam time, we have generated, for the first time, high-resolution images of this enigmatic tissue (Fig 1,2 &amp;3), and documented its presence and distribution both within and between species, and extended the diversity of species that are known to develop it. Fine scans were used to interrogate the cellular, organic and matrix contents of the capping tissue (Fig1, ii) as well as to investigate its interface with the underlying bone (Fig1, iii). The samples (sample size: 800 µm diameter, max 3mm depth) studied include osteoderms that vary in scale from cm (Tiliqua) to mm (Heloderma). All samples were stable within the beam line.</p><p>Lizard capping tissue demonstrates species-specific differences in thickness and organization. In Heloderma the capping tissue is approximately 5-10% of the thickness of the osteoderm (~30-100 µm). Compared with the underlying bone, it is modestly cellular (Fig2 i c-d). In contrast, the capping tissue of Broadleysaurus (Fig1) (&gt;50 µm) is virtually acellular and is characterized by numerous vertically directed canaliculi. All species demonstrate an extensive lacuno-canalicular network. Osteocytes of approximately 5 µm cell body diameter (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ii white arrow) in Heloderma were visualised with extensive canaliculi networks (Fig2 ii &amp; iii), each canaliculi measuring at most 0.5 µm in diameter, similar to human canaliculi <ref type="bibr">(Yu et al., 2020)</ref>, in a complex network primarily spreading horizontally within the bone and penetrating the capping tissue. The capping tissue also contained multiple collagen bundles, potentially mineralised, of approximately 2.5 µm diameter that tethered it to the superficial dermis. In contrast to the broad spreading horizontal canaliculi of Heloderma, the canaliculi of the cells in Broadleysaurus (Fig1 iii) were exceptionally fine and arranged vertically, from a border of bone. The capping tissue was composed of a matrix that varied within the sample in its apparent electron density (most visible in the Tiliqua sample, where its thickness was much greater &gt;200 µm, and where horizons of electron density were visible at a scale of 1.2 µm (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 ii</ref>)), as well as layers within the capping tissue of greater and lesser cellular density at the 10s of µm scale. This preliminary report prepared using initial data from three species summarises the qualitative evaluation of the samples. These data will further allow a quantitative comparison of osteoderm capping tissue cellularity, to be combined with material characteristics from nanoindentation, and histological appearance. For example: the capping tissue is harder than bone but softer than enamel <ref type="bibr">(Marghoub et al., 2022)</ref>, this is consistent with our new findings on its nanoscale structure, where the capping tissue combines matrix and cellular contents, while bone has a higher cellular fraction, and mature enamel is limited to a crystalline matrix with no cellular contents. The data acquired raise new questions concerning the chemical composition of this capping layer -i) is it consistent between species, ii) does it change with depth from the underlying bone, ii) is it mainly inorganic, and where there is a component of cellular processes, e.g., Broadleysaurus, how do they contribute to the chemical and material characteristics of this still enigmatic tissue.</p><p>We have moved in this beam time substantially beyond what was previous possible -where the difference between species could not be clearly seen on µCT or light microscopy (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>The central remaining question is: are the difference we see in holotomography dictated by a chemical shift in composition within the capping layer, or a change in the density of the same material? This question will be best addressed by a 2D Xray-fluorescence investigation of the same samples. Resulting data will also shed light on large scale evolutionary and ecological questions regarding the relationship of the capping tissue characteristics to global environmental distribution (the species in question are native to N. America, Europe, Australia and Africa, and separated by 200 million years of evolution) diet, seasonality, and function. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Broadleysaurus major, osteoderm i, 200µm field of view with (a) vacuum/resin (b) dermis/capping tissue (c) capping tissue and (d) underlying bone, greyscale 3D phase contrast image of whole field with overlain 3D colour visualisation of electron density within the bone and capping tissue. ii 100 µm field of view osteocytes (white arrow) at capping tissue and bone boundary, projecting canaliculi (black arrow) vertically into the capping tissue matrix, which appears here as clear iii high magnification view of the density of protruding canaliculi.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.00,556.63,522.45,193.10" type="bitmap" /></figure>
