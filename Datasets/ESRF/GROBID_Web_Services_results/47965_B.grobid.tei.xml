<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The allocated beamtime has been split in two sessions of three days to optimize our measurements. The distribution of Cu and Zn in the roots of two plants, one monocotyledon, Phalaris arundinacea, and one dicotyledon, Thlaspi arvensis, have been imaged at several scanning resolutions down to 180 x 180 nm using micro-and nano-SXRF, and the chemical form of Cu in the two plants interrogated using micro-XANES. The fresh samples were cryofixed at high pressure, then cryosubstituted to preserve the fine structures, and finally sectioned in slices of two micrometers in thickness. As an example of the results, we show below, (1) an optical image of a prepartion taken in transmission with the beamline camera (a), (2) two high-resolution nano-SXRF maps (b,c), and (3) one micro-XANES spectrum (d).</p><p>The optical image (a) is from a root of P. arundinacea. It shows that the vacuolar content and cytoplasm were preserved in several regions of the preparation. We focused our analyses on these areas and examined in total four microtomic slices for each plant. Fluorescence maps collected in the cortex region showed that Cu is associated mainly with the cell walls and present also in the cytoplasm and on inner-cell membranes (such as vacuoles) (b). Zinc, instead, is predominantly stored inside the vacuoles, and to a lesser extent also present on cell walls. These observations gives an inkling into the metal homeostasis in the plants. Zn, as we know it, is preferentially complexed to small organic acids, such as</p></div>

In contrast, the presence of Cu in the cytosol can be explained by its inferred complexation to amino acids and peptides. The compartmentation of Cu and Zn described in the cortex is also observed in the stele (c). The xyleme vessels, which translocate metals from roots to shoots, contain Cu and Zn "grains". Importantly, the grains were never multimetallic, suggesting that Cu and Zn are transported to the leaves by different molecules. Because Cu has a strong affinity for amine and amid groups, it has been proposed to be transported by free amino acids, as reported for nickel in other plants. The micro-XANES spectrum shown in (d), characterized by a deep diagnostic pre-peak, provides the first direct evidence that Cu is indeed strongly chelated to one or several N-containing residues, such as histidine and methionine. More complete analysis of the data is now under course.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The multiple roles of copper in biochemical reactions result from the redox-sensitivity of the Cu 2+ /Cu + couple, which has elevated standard electrode potentials when complexed in proteins that facilitate electron transfer in cellular processes. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Imbalances in cellular copper are implicated in multiple diseases that strike eukaryotic organisms. In plants, copper is essential for photosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, lignin synthesis, root growth, ethylene sensing, and reactive oxygen metabolism. <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref> Typically, the concentration of nutrient copper falls between 5 and 30 mg kg À1 dry weight (DW) in vegetative tissues, regardless of the copper concentration of the soil in which the plant grows. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> When in excess, copper can catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals, with subsequent damage to macromolecules involved in the production (chloroplasts) and storage (mitochondria) of energy, to protein synthesis, and to biomembranes through the peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> To maintain nutrient requirements, while simultaneously protecting photosynthetic and reproductive tissues from excess amounts, vascular plants have evolved physiological mechanisms to regulate the concentration of copper in root cells and its transport in vascular bundles (i.e., xylem sap) from the stele. <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> Knowledge of the location and molecular forms of copper in the root is sparse, especially at non-toxic concentrations.
