<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of the experiment was to compare the behaviour under steady shear of well ordered cubic mesophases of different symmetries: fee and bee respectively. These cubic phases are obtained from weakly amphiphilic triblock copolymers (polyoxyethylene / polyoxypropylene / polyoxyethylene) which spontaneously self assemble in water into spherical micelle havin, g a dense POP core and a diffuse POE corona. At sufficient concentration these micelles pile up into well ordered cubic mesophases. The nature of the lattice depends on the relative length of the POE and POP moieties. In a former experiment conducted in April 1996 we characterized in details the structural evolution under shear of the fee cubic phase obtained from the PIuronic F 108-copolymer (see the former experiment report: I lost the number): a very progressive alignment of the scattering pattern could be interpreted in terms of a progressive transformation of the initial polycrystalline texture into the so called "layer sliding" regime.</p><p>During run no SC401, we characterized in a similar manner the response to shear of the bcc cubic phase from the Pluronic F68 copolymer. In the radial geometry (X-beam analogous to the phase coexistence at constant chemical potential in a binary mixture undergoing a first order phase separation. In this respect the behavior of the bcc structure differs markedly from that of the fcc structure for which the structural change upon increasing rates is very progressive. This very interesting analogy with a phase transition is under current theoretical investigation.</p><p>On the other hand, the layer sliding regime in the present bcc structure appears more complex than expected: the scattering pattern in I'i, CT 3 is taken in the tangential geometry (beam along the velocity direction) at high shear rate. It complexity implies that two non symmetrically equivalent orientations are simultaneously present in the high shear regime. The interpretation of this complex pattern is under progress.</p></div>			</div>
