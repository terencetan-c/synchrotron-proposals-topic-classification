<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Nature has selected manganese-containing enzymes as catalysts for a number of fundamental biochemical transformations involving O-O bond formation and cleavage. For example, a tetra-nuclear manganese cluster present in the active site of the Oxygen Evolving Complex of PSII is responsible for photosynthetic H 2 O splitting and O-O bond formation enabling aerobic life to utilize the energy stored in the O-O bond for growth and repair. On the other hand O-O bond cleavage is involved in DNA repair, a reaction carried out by class Ib Ribonucleotide reductases. In both processes, Mn-peroxo species (Mn-µ-(O 2 2-)-Mn) are invoked as key intermediates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> However, such peroxo intermediates have yet to be isolated in enzyme systems and small molecule analogues are few. Yet an understanding of such species should provide key mechanistic insights into transition metal dioxygen chemistry.</p><p>Herein, in collaboration with the Kovacs group, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> we initiated an X-ray absorption and emission study for a series of reactants, products and intermediates involved in the activation and cleavage of an O-O bond by Mn (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These include the Mn(II) starting compound (1), the Mn(III)-peroxo dimer intermediate (2) that in turn converts into a Mn(III)-bis-u-oxo species (3) upon O-O bond cleavage. In addition we have started investigating a series of Mn-alkyl peroxo monomers with O-O bond lengths that vary over ~0.1 Å, in principle allowing us to quantitatively asses the degree of O-O activation. Extensive radiation studies were carried out for all compounds, and data was acquired using multiple sample spots with a collection time per spot optimized to give the best signal to noise ratio with minimal or no radiation damage. Clear differences are seen in both the XAS and XES-V2C spectra of the starting compound (1) and the final product (3). The XAS spectra are consistent with a Mn(II) and Mn(III) species, respectively, while comparison of the XES-V2C data with theoretical calculations, are consistent with a Mn-oxo species in the final product. Unfortunately, the XES-V2C spectra of the Mn(III)peroxo intermediate (2), resembles the Mn(III)-bis-u-oxo final product (3) and is inconsistent with its respective calculated XES spectrum, both in terms of the Kβ 2,5 relative intensities and the K β", suggesting a mixture of intermediate and final product, with the latter being dominant. Similarly, the rising edges of the XAS spectra of the Mn-alkyl peroxo compounds (4,5) reveal that these are mixed samples containing both Mn(III) alkyl peroxo as well as starting material, which has Mn(II) centers. As such these samples did not merit further detailed study by RIXS as initially planned. These results highlight the difficulty in synthesizing and isolating Mn-oxo and Mn-peroxo intermediates in yields and purities that are optimal for XAS/XES. We are currently working with our collaborators to better optimize the conditions for these measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: List of Mn compounds</head><p>As our measurements on the Mn-oxo/peroxo systems did not yield good initial results the remainder of our beamtime was utilized to obtain initial VtC XES data, which has formed the basis for a new proposal. The preliminary experiments were aimed at understanding the information content of high energy resolution fluorescence detected x-ray absorption spectra (HERFD XAS). It has been proposed that chemicallyselective XAS spectra may be obtained by detecting from valence-to-core x-ray emission (VtC XES) features known to correspond to a given ligand, though these epxeriments do not seem to have yet been reported. Thus, we have investigated a series of well-characterized manganese model compounds in order to develop VtC HERFD as a ligand-selective spectroscopic probe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3: The standard TFY XAS (left) and non-resonant XES (right) spectra of the compounds under investigation. Figure 2: (left) XAS of compounds (1)-(5); (center) XES-V2C spectra of (1)-(3); (right)</head><p>Calculated XES-V2C spectra of ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">3</ref>). We began by collecting standard total fluorescence yield (TFY) XAS and non-resonant XES spectra of our compounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). These spectra clearly demonstrate the respective sensitivities of these techniques: XAS to compound symmetry and ligand field strength and XES to ligand identity and metal-ligand bond length. From established methods of interpretation, we can assign the intense pre-edge XAS features as being dominated by the oxo or nitrido ligands interacting with the Mn 3d orbitals that, due to the low symmetries and short bond lengths seen in these compounds, also have significant 4p mixing. For the XES spectra, the Kβ" peak may be assigned as originating from the oxo / nitrido 2s orbitals that possess a small amount of Mn np character. For the nitrido compounds, the Kβ 2,5 feature is composed of contributions from the cyanide 2s2s σ* orbital (lower energy peak) and a mix of cyanide 2p2p σ and nitride 2p orbitals (higher energy peak) while the same feature in the oxo compound corresponds to a mixture of taml and oxygen 2p orbitals.</p><p>From these assignments it was clear that the Kβ" XES features were an ideal spectroscopic handle for collecting ligand-selective XAS since they derived almost exclusively from the oxo / nitrido ligands. Further, because the pre-edges are also dominated by contributions from these same ligands, intensity modulations were expected to be pronounced and easily discernable.</p><p>HERFD spectra were thus collected by detection from these VtC features. Because energetic shifts of the peaks were possible during resonant excitation, full resonant x-ray emission (RXES) planes were collected so as to allow accurate determination of appropriate detection energies. An example of this procedure is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> for (NMe 4 ) 2 Na[Mn(CN) 5 N].</p><p>The VtC HERFD spectra for (PPh 4 ) 2 [Mn(CN) 4 N] and (NMe 4 ) 2 Na[Mn(CN) 5 N] are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> and are overlaid with the respective TFY spectra. Dramatic modulations of pre-edge intensity are observed that range from slight decreases to large increases and that depend strongly on the VtC feature used for detection. Interestingly, a decrease in intensity is seen when detecting from the Kβ" while detection from either of the Kβ 2,5 peaks yields large increases. This is perhaps counterintuitive as, from an analogy to resonance Raman spectroscopy, it might be expected that detecting from the oxo / nitrido-dominated Kβ" would enhance the oxo / nitrido-dominated pre-edge; similarly, the low energy Kβ 2,5 feature almost exclusively derives from the cyanide ligands, so detection from this peak might be expected to result in a decrease in pre-edge intensity.</p><p>Neither of these predictions, however, is supported by the experimental results. These data demonstrate that the simple picture of being able to use VtC features for ligand-selective XAS is not entirely accurate. They do, however, indicate that additional information may be obtained by detecting XAS from VtC features. While an in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms governing the intesity modulations observed is currently elusive, it is clear that additional factors must be considered to rationalize these observations and predict how VtC-detection will affect XAS spectra. Further study is mertited.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Dr. Serena DeBeer (MPI CEC) Mr. Christopher Pollock* (MPI CEC) Dr. Vlad Martin-Diaconescu* (MPI CEC) Dr. Frederico Lima* (MPI CEC)</figDesc></figure>
