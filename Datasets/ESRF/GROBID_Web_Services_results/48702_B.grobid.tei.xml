<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objects of study during beamtime CH3498 have been large zeolite H-ZSM-5 crystals. Main goals were i) to proof their proposed intergrowth structure crystallographically and ii) to study the influence of crystal structure, defects and surface heterogeneities on catalytic activity. Room temperature, gas phase oligomerization of 4-methoxy styrene has been employed as a labeling reaction to fluorescently label Brønsted acid sites at the zeolite surface and in the bulk, respectively. Due to the availability of a video microscope with 20x and 50x magnification, the location of the zeolite crystals could be easily achieved. The use of an atomic force microscope (AFM) was not indicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-ray diffractograms on spots of large parent (as-synthesized, detemplated) H-ZSM-5</head><p>Using the available video microscope and the xyz piezo scanning stage, the zeolite crystals could be aligned properly with the incident X-ray beam (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Diffraction was taken for ZSM-5 (2 0 0) and related higher order Bragg reflections. Going to higher order reflections, a splitting became visible indicating differences in the d-spacings of the crystal lattice. This was a first hint of two different phases or 90° rotated intergrowth building units present in the crystals. Referring to the lattice constants of <ref type="bibr">b=20.107 Å,</ref><ref type="bibr">c=13.369 Å,</ref><ref type="bibr">α=90°,</ref><ref type="bibr">β=90.67°,</ref><ref type="bibr">γ=90°)</ref>, the observed splitting most probably can be ascribed to the presence of 90° rotated intergrowths. Further analysis and mapping of the large zeolite crystals was based on splitted 16 0 0 and 18 0 0 Bragg reflections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Those reflections have been sampled by x,y-maps with a step size of 0.4-0.8° in an interval of 2-3° 2Θ. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>µ-XRD mapping of parent H-ZSM-5 crystals</head><p>The zeolite crystals were in a next step subjected to x,y-mapping based on scattering intensity at fixed angles. The spatial intensity distribution maps for a parent H-ZSM-5 crystal are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> and <ref type="figure">c</ref> for two different 2Θ angles. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> shows the scattering intensity distribution at lower angles of the 18 0 0 reflex corresponding to the domain with the higher d-spacing value whereas Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> shows the domain with the lower d-spacing. Intensity maps display integrated CCD detector counts. To study the dependence of relative alignment of crystals and incident beam and with that the orientation of the intergrowth units, crystals have been mapped in flipped orientation and 90° rotated to the incident X-ray beam, respectively. With this data set, the recently proposed intergrowth structure of large H-ZSM-5 -obtained from confocal fluorescence microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction experiments -will get a crystallographic foundation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of dealumination treatment by post-synthesis steaming treatment</head><p>In a further mapping series, steamed H-ZSM-5 have been studied. Depending on the steaming treatment conditions, mesoporosity is introduced to the crystals. At low temperature (500 °C) steaming introduces mainly surface mesoporosity, 700 °C steaming leads to a pronounced mesoporosity throughout the crystal bulk. With this mapping data will show the influence of dealumination on crystallinity and d-spacing as well as the formation of amorphous parts of the single intergrowth units.</p><p>Proof-of-concept: Combined µXRD-XEOL experiments for structure-activity relationships of heterogeneous catalysts 8.5 keV X-rays passing through the zeolite sample impregnated with methoxy styrene -a selective probe for the distribution of Brønsted acid, catalytically active sites -induced an optical luminscence signal in the visible spectral range. The very basic CCD camera of the video microscope installed at ID01 thus was read out and the total integrated intensity was mapped along the x,y-translation of the sample stage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). In that way, we were able to obtain -along with scattering intensity maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>  Further data treatment is in progress. Publication of the µXRD mapping data with respect to the intergrowth structure of large H-ZSM-5 is targeted. A further publication of combined µXRD and XEOL to establish structure-activity relationship requires a follow up beamtime, which will be applied for in the upcoming round October 2012.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The collection of the XEOL signal thus provides a way to acquire simultaneously combined µXRD scattering data and spatial distribution of fluorescent species, which -in this case -indicate catalytically active sites.</figDesc></figure>
