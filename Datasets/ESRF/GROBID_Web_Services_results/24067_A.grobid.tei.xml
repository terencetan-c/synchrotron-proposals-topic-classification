<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>showed limited diffraction at our home source. At ESRF one of the crystals diffracted to 1.6 A and yielded data with acceptable R-factors up to 1.7 A. A complete dataset was collected, processed and scaled. Structure solution by molecular replacement using the structure of the homologous Phl p 7 protein is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phl p 7</head><p>The structure of Phl p 7 has been solved recently <ref type="bibr">(Verdino et.el. EMBO J. 2002, 21, 5007-16.)</ref> We now got crystals diffracting to substantially higher resolution and collected data to 1.25 A. The objective of this experiment was the characterization of a potential ligand in the internal cavity of the dimer. The high resolution structure of Phl p 7 has been refined, however no clear density for the putative ligand was visible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SbsC7</head><p>SbsC7 is a surface layer protein from B. stearothermophilus. We crystallized the C-terminal deletion mutant SbsC7, which diffracted to 3.1 A. We collected a native and 3 putative derivative datasets. Data were processed and scaled to native and derivative data obtained from earlier Synchrotron data collections. Only 2 derivative datasets gave reasonable R-factors. A problem with all SbsC7 data sets collected during this beamtime was the rapid decay of the crystals due to radiation damage and the resulting lack of completeness.</p><p>a.o.Univ.Prof. Dr. Ulrike G. Wagner Institut für Chemie Heinrichstrasse 28 A-8010 Graz Austria</p><p>Karl-Franzens-UniversitätGraz SBM Our goal was to collect data to a moderate resolution. The very long c-axis (550 Å) makes the data processing difficult, because very small errors in the orientation matrix result in wrong predictions. The crystal has good mosaicity and the spots are well separated but we still have some problems to get good enough data to solve the structure. It might be helpful to recollect one of our crystals with even smaller oscillation angles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EstA</head><p>The collected data of a presumable Osmium derivative show a peak with very low occupancy and not enough phasing power to solve the structure. We would therefore like to collect some other derivative data to finally solve this protein structure.</p></div>		</body>
