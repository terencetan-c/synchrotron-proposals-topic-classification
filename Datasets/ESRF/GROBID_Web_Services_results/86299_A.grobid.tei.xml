<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>One of the greatest challenges facing our generation is ensuring the safe, long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel, predominantly in the form of UO2 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Despite the progress that has been made internationally in developing multi-barrier containment strategies, there remains a significant possibility of containment failure and the subsequent release of radionuclides into the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. This process occurs when the surface of waste fuel is exposed to ground water and the potentially oxidising conditions which lead to the degradation of the fuel matrix. While this has been widely studied, the precise reaction mechanism is still hotly debated and the reaction rate dependence on grain boundary density is yet to be determined.</p><p>Through a previous experiment conducted at XMaS (see reports 28-01-997 and 28-01-1034) we have been able to develop a method of simulating the corrosive, oxidative environment which is present under storage conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>. Using a thin film water tension cell, the effect of radiolytic corrosion on UO2 thin films was investigated, using water and an x-ray beam, as both a source (a radiation field) and a probe, to study corrosion at the fuel/water interface. A combination of x-ray reflectivity (XRR) and high angle x-ray diffraction was used to determine changes in the morphology and crystallinity of the oxide. This study has allowed us to explore the role of grain boundaries on corrosion rates and investigate the reaction mechanism of x-ray driven radiolytic dissolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results</head><p>To improve understading of the mechanism of radilytic dissolytion we investigated effect of the number of corrosion steps (a step being the opening and closing of the beam shutter) for a fixed cumulative corrosion time, i.e. comparing one step of 300 s with 300 steps of 1 s. The results from this investigation are show in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where it can be seen that the change in UO2 [001] sample thickness increases with number of corrosion steps. Complimentary experiments performed using a lab source at the University of Bristol found that this effect was not seen when using H2O2 solution to mimick the products of radiolytic dissolution. This fits with our previous comparisons showing that H2O2 is not responsible for the majority of the oxidation that occurs during radiolytic dissolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>. Considering the reaction mechanism, this result is indicative that corrosion rates are not uniform over the duration of a corrosion step, possibly due to a localised saturation of the solution in the beam path or passivation of the UO2 surface.</p><p>Investigation of the effect of grain size on dissolution rates were performed using novel polyepitaxial thin films of UO2, where the polycrystalline film grain size is controlled by epitaxial matching to the polycrystalline substrate, allowing film with grain size of 10 -50 Î¼m to be fabricated. Analysis of the XRR results showed no clear trend in corrosion rate as a function of grain size, however, it was found that roughness of the surface after 300 s corrosion increased with decreasing grain size. From previous investigations it is known that different orientations corrode at different rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. As the distribution of grain surface orientations in each sample is assumed to be the same, it is suggested that the results from this experiment show that there is no strong prefence for intergranular corrosion over intragranular corrosion on UO2 surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Adding complexity to our experimental model of a UO2 surface by using polyepitaxial films has provided new insight into the effect of grain boundary density on radiolytic dissolution. Evidence that the number of corrosion steps for a fixed time period has an effect on corrosion rates shows a need for better awareness of the chemistry of the solution and sample surface. This is problem for which in-situ investigations are most likely to provide a solution. In conclusion, the results from this experiment have improved understanding of the radiloytic corrosion mechanism of UO2 surfaces, helping to understand the degradation of nuclear fuels in long-term storage and guide the next direction of research for this complex problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): R.
