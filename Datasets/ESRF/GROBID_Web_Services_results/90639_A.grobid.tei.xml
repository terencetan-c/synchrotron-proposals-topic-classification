<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to study the load path change effect on two kinds of light Aluminium alloys AA2198 T8R and AA2139 T3R, 3 different non-proportional loading in-situ experiments of 2 materials (see Table <ref type="table">below</ref>) were planned to be conducted using laminography at beamline ID19.</p><p>Table.1 Initial experiment plan under 3 loading conditions of 2 materials. Shear-Tension Tension-Shear Tension-Tension AA2198 T8R 1 1 1 AA2139 T3R 1 1 1 Due to control and encoder problems of the laminography station only one Shear-Tension test on AA2198 T8R was conducted. 5 or more tests need to be done. The test started at 0:42 am on 29 Nov 2018, after 10 (shear) and 13 (tension) scans shown in  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result</head><p>The loading history and scan points are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> during the scanned experiment. Finite element model is created to simulate the same non-proportional Shear-Tension experiment where the blue line stands for simulated results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The accumulated plastic strain fields at every scanning step are obtained where finally the strain to fracture can to be read. The damage evolution is observed from selected volume (yellow frame: 1600×1000×1100 voxels) at typical 4 steps in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> where the voids are observed to nucleate and grow during the shear loading and the tracked voids subsequently continued to grow under tension till fracture. Strain was measured in the material bulk using 2D sections of projected 3D data.</p><p>Based on the laminographic experiment, the results have been shown as poster at two symposia and the lecture will be presented at different conferences this year (ECF23, ICCA17, WCCM-ECCOMAS2020). Currently a paper entitled "Effect of a shear to tension load path change on damage mechanisms and strain to fracture: 3D in situ measurement and FE analyses" is in progress.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>at high resolution (650 nm/pixel), the linear encoders that control the position of laminography station were out of service at 7:00 am on 29 Nov 2018 and we lost the position. The system was recovered at 21:00 and much time was spent. Finally, two more scans were taken on this experiment before the fracture at low resolution (1460.25 nm/pixel). The raw volume size is 2560×2560×1500 voxels for each scanning. The dedicated motorized in situ tensile machine (Fig.1) worked successfully.</figDesc></figure>
