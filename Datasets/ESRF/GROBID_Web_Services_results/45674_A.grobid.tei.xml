<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>(1) Transition towards the high pressure phase (HPP)</p><p>We were able to detect the existence of the HPP phase by scaning pressure at several temperatures. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> that a structural phase transition occurs above P C (295K) ≈ 22 GPa in GaTa 4 Se 8 at 295 K. This phase transition shifts to lower pressure (P C (73K) ≈ 17 GPa) at low temperature. The same transition also appears in GaNb 4 Se 8 at a slightly lower pressure (P C (295K) ≈ 17 Gpa). In both compounds, this transition shows a large hysteresis : upon decreasing pressure, significant amounts of HPP phase can be still detected at 9 GPa in GaNb 4 Se 8 at 295 K.</p><p>(2) Mott transition Theoretically, the typical fingerprints of a Mott metal-insulator transition under pressure are : (i) the Mott insulator and metallic phases should be isostructural, (ii) a volume collapse is expected going from the Mott insulating to the metallic phase.</p><p>It is already known from a transport study of GaTa 4 Se 8 that the metal-insulator occurs between 5.5 and 8.4 GPa above 200 K 1 . Our study clearly shows that XRD data can be refined with the same m F 3 4 space group below 5.5 GPa and above 8.4 GPa. Also, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2-a</ref> shows that the evolution of the cell parameter a as a function of the applied pressure can be nicely described with a Murnaghan Equation of State (EoS), i.e. ' 3 1 0 0 ) 1 ' ( K p K K a a -+ =</p><p>. A clear deviation from this law appears at the transition towards the HP phase above 22 GPa. In order to detect a possible small drop of the unit cell a, we subtracted the smooth fitted Murnaghan dependance a Murnaghan (P) from the measured a(P). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2-b</ref> shows that a very small drop of the cell parameter occurs at P Mott (295K) = 6.5 ± 1 GPa. The Mott transition line poorly depends on temperature, since P Mott (37K) = 6 ± 1 GPa (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2-c</ref>). Noteworthy the volume contraction related to the Mott insulator to metal transition is very small in GaTa 4 Se 8 , ∆V/V ≈ 0.1 %, as compared e.g. (3) spin gap phase transition By decreasing temperature below the spin gap temperature (T spin gap = 52 K), we observed the appearance of very weak super-structure peaks (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). These new peaks corresponds to a change from a F to a P centering, in agreement with our recent low temperature XRD study of GaTa 4 Se 8 at ambient pressure. These new peaks tend to disappear with applied pressure. A precise determination of P spin gap (37 K) is difficult using these data only. However we note that a relative volume increase (∆V/V ≈ 0.07 %) occurs around 2 GPa (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) at the same temperature. We have already observed a comparable volume change at the temperatureinduced spin gap transition. 4 phase but allowed in the P-centered spin gap phase. As expected, the (211) peak is absent at 70K, above the spin gap transition temperature T spin gap = 52 K at ambient pressure. Conversely, the peak appears at 37 K below T spin gap but progressively disappears by applying pressure.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">with 1.2 % in V 2 O 3 2 .

New measurements at temperature lower than 37 K (around 5K) and on single crystals will allow to clarify the last unsolved part of the GaTa4Se8 temperature -pressure phase diagram</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>and Raman study under pressure of the Mott insulators GaM 4 Se 8 (M=Nb, Ta) : unravelling a Mott transition, and a possible spin gap / superconducting phases coexistence des Matériaux Jean Rouxel (Nantes, France) Vincent Guiot*, Institut des Matériaux Jean Rouxel (Nantes, France) Etienne Janod*, Institut des Matériaux Jean Rouxel (Nantes, France) Gaston Garbarino*, ESRF This experiment carried out at ID09 aimed to establish the temperature-pressure phase diagram of the Mott insulators GaM 4 Se 8 (M= Nb, Ta), which are rare examples of inorganic compounds that undergoes metalinsulator-superconductor transitions under pressure. X-Ray diffraction under pressure should allow to clarify the existence and position of three transition lines : (1) the new structural transition line observed at very high pressure (p S ≈ 26 GPa) in our preliminary measurement at 300 K, (2) the first order transition line expected at the Mott transition under pressure, (3) the spin gap phase transition line which exists below 52 K in GaTa 4 Se 8 at ambient pressure.</figDesc></figure>
