<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Stathmin is a 17 kDa ubiquitous phosphoprotein that has been proposed to be a relay integrating diverse intracellular signaling pathways. This protein has also been identified as a microtubule destabilizing factor likely to be implicated in various microtubule dependent cellular functions in interphase or mitosis. Stathmin influences microtubule dynamics in vivo and in vitro either by preventing assembly or promoting disassembly of microtubules in a concentration-dependant manner.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Stathmin interacts with the αβ tubulin heterodimer to form a ternary complex comprising one stathmin and two tubulins. This complex has proven to be stable enough to be cristallized, whereas no welldiffracting 3D-crystal of tubulin has been reported up to now. The only near-atomic structural information on tubulin comes from electron microscopy of tubulin protofilaments. We have determined the 4 Å x-ray structure of a complex of GDP-tubulin with the stathmin-like fragment of RB3, a stathmin family protein (PDB ID code : 1FFX). This structure was solved by molecular replacement using the electron microscopy model <ref type="bibr">(Cell (2000)</ref> 102, 809-816).</p><p>Informations on the tubulin-stathmin interactions and on the way stathmin sequesters tubulin were gained from this structure but, in order to define the interactions of tubulin with ligands and nucleotides, a more precise structure is required. Experimental phases have been deduced from experiments performed prior to this visit at ESRF. During this visit 8 cryobuffers were tested in order to improve the resolution limit of our data. Glucose was found to perform best. This has allowed us to measure data to 3.5 Å resolution (Rmerge: 8.2 %). Together with the phases we have previously determined, these data are used in the refinement of the stathmin-tubulin structure which is now nearly complete (R: 0.23, Rfree: 0.26). This is being prepared for publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural study of Actin:</head><p>The assembly of actin filaments is regulated by several proteins. Thymosin β4 sequesters actin whereas proteins such as Ciboulot participate in the assembly of actin at the barbed end of filaments; all these proteins are members of the actobindin familly and share an actin-binding domain for which no crystal structure is known, either alone or in complex with actin. Using one single crystal (the only one we have ever obtained) of an actin-ciboulot complex, we collected a 2.5 Å data set (Rmerge: 9%) and determined the structure. Refinement is now complete (R: 0.23). This work is being prepared for publication.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M. Graille, N. Leuliot (1 shift) : yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Structural Genomics project</head><p>The systematic names of the genes are used. More details on every orf can be found on <ref type="url" target="http://genomics.eu.org:targets.html">http://genomics.eu.org:targets.html</ref> 1)YDR533c (target 155 ).

Structural similarity may exist with a protein from Methanococcus whose structure was recently solved in a structural genomics project at Berkeley. The protein is probably a protease but this has to be confirmed experimentally. As this orf contains no methionine with the exception of the N-terminal one for 237 residues, we constructed a quadruple methionine mutant. We planned to collect a full MAD dataset but crystals died just in the middle of the SeMet peak wavelength. We couldn't do anything with this partial dataset.</p><p>2)YFL030w (target 241). Spacegroup P3221 a=b=58A; c=185A. Resolution 3A. Completion 99% Rsym=6.8%</p><p>This protein of unknown structure has been annotated as a putative alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase, probably PLP-dependent. We have crystallised this orf in the presence of PLP, a putative cofactor. One dataset has been collected during this shift but it will only be usefull when experimental phases will be obtained from SeMet crystals.</p></div>			</div>
