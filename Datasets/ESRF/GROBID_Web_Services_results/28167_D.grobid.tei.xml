<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiments reported here have been performed in the framework of a CNRS-DFG project involving the DLR in Cologne and the CRMHT inOrleans. The two laboratories are specialized respectively in electromagnetic <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and aerodynamic [2] levitation techniques and they have joined their technologies bining inductive heating with aerodynamic levitation.</p><p>nted on the figure 1. Heating coil and levitation nozzle a to develop a new hybrid system com The center of this new device is prese re housed in a vacuum chamber. A spherical sample (diameter=3mm) was levitated using a gas flow going trough a BN nozzle situated in the center of the chamber. Then it was heated to the desired temperature using the RF coil. In order to avoid oxidation, the chamber was initially pumped down to low pressure and then filled with argon (with 2.5% H 2 ). re problems, we , it was not possible to make the diffraction experiments as planned.

At high temperature, we had additional perturbations from the R ty will overcome em.Calculation are in progress for extracting structural d</p><p>An other problem was the difficult adjustment of the sample into the beam. We plan to include a motorized displacement of the nozzle.</p><p>In the future, an INEL 120° curved detector will be fixed on the SAXS table. Thus, it will be possible to perform diffraction measure meter.</p><p>The aim of these first experiments was to study the structure of liquid metals and alloys by combining total x-ray diffraction and EXAFS measurements. Due to hardwa could not install our levitation chamber on the beamline goniometer. Thus xperiment table but with this configuration, only EXAFS measurements wer EXAFS measurements were made in the fluorescence mode using a ph inside the chamber. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows EXAFS spectra obtained with a CoC temperature and at 1050°C. The quality of the measurements is relatively b high temperature. At room temperature, this is mostly due to the strong a signal in the argon atmos F coil and from the light emission of the sample.
