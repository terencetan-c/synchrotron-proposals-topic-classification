<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this study we have recorded time-resolved simultaneous WAXS and strain data during the uniaxial and biaxial deformation of polypropylene (PP) using the Keele drawing camera. The camera allows samples to be drawn biaxially either simultaneously or sequentially with varying delay time between the draws in each direction. In this report we describe the results obtained simultaneous and seqential biaxial draw with various delay times of PP samples at a nominal draw rate of 72000% min -1 and at 155 o C up to a nominal draw ratio of 8:1. Diffraction data and strain data was recorded using a CCD camera with 40 milliseconds time resolution. Sample thinning at the point where the diffraction pattern was recorded was moinitored by computing the total integrated intensity of the wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) pattern.</p><p>We have deveopled an analytical techniques to analysize the whole WAXS two dimensional diffraction to determine the crystallinity index during deformation of a polymer sample in these experiments. Typical results from the above experiments using a novel analytical technique to separate the crystalline and amorphous components are shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> shows the initial crystalline component of the WAXS pattern and figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>figure 2 with (a) (+), (b) (×), (c) ( * ) and (d) (□). It can be seen from figure 2 that there is very little difference in the changes in crystallinity during the various simultaneous biaxial draws. During the sequentail draw (□) up to the end of first draw (417 milliseconds) the changes in crystallinity index are similar to those on simultaneous biaxial draws. However, the subsequent second draw shows a 50% increase in the crystallinity index. This result has major implications for the design of protocols for commercial film production where the extent of crystallinty has important consequences for product properties.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,60.60,460.90,321.06,224.98" type="bitmap" /></figure>
