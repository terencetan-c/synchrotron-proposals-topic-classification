The charge of the DHBC or the micellisation agent is pH sensitive, hence pH is used to control the micellisation of these objects. They hence a found a promising application as templating agents for the synthesis of mesoporous silica: by forming the micelles during the material synthesis, before breaking the micelles by pH variation and freeing the porosity. This method has the advantage to functionalise in one step the material, as the DHBC (remaining in the silica walls) is used as templating agent but also functionalisation agent.</p><p>To use these PIC micelles for material formation, it is highly needed to study their phase diagram in suspension, at different pHs and temperature. We hence studied different groups of DHBC and micellisation agents, namely PAPEO-b-PAA (comb like poly ethylene oxidebpoly acrylic acid) or PAPEO-b-PSS (poly styrene sulfonate) as DHBC and oligochitosan (2500 or 7500 g/mol) or neomycin as micellisation agent (13 series). The phase diagrams were studied at pHs 4.5, 5.5 or 6.5; where micelles are formed thanks to electrostatic complexation, and at 20, 40 and 60°C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> present one of the phase diagram, measured at a sample detector distance of 1.5 m (measurements at 31 m were also done but the data are still under treatment), with concentration ranging from 0.1 to 50 wt% From the data, one can see the increase of micelle-micelle repulsion with concentration, first fitted using a hard sphere repulsion model. We have observed from the data treatment that the strength of the repulsion decreases with temperature, probably as the amount of water within the micelles core decreases and hence their overall volume fraction decrease. We also observed clear mesophases when neomycin is used as micellisation agent, while samples with oligochitosan still exhibit a broad peak even at 50 wt%. We are currently fitting the data obtained. During this beamtime, as we were allocated 9 shifts, we carried also the experiments related to the beamtime application sc5246 "Probing the formation of mesoporous silica microspheres by a combination of SAXS and USAXS". Those silica microspheres are made using a combination of two DHBC: PAPEO-b-PAA and PAPEOb-PAM (polyacrylamide). We expect the latter to stabilise the forming mesostructured particles and control the overall shape. We did ca. 10 kinetics including repeats, by using either neomycin or oligochitosan as micellisation agent, and by varying the ratio of PAPEO-b-PAA/PAPEO-b-PAM in the mixtures. The data are currently under treatment, but the signal associated to the microspheres could be seen in the USAXS regime (sample detector distance of 31 m).</p><p>Finally, we did some first tests of kinetics using a triple hydrophilic block copolymer (THBC) naming PAM-b-PAA-b-PAPEO; which allows forming mesoporous materials as 3D, 1D or even 0D depending on the synthesis conditions. As a proof of concept, we studied the synthesis of 1D particles (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). It is clear from the pattern that we can see the emergence of a signal from the overall mesoporous objects in the ultra small angle regime (sample detector distance of 31 m). From this beamtime, we hence studied the complete phase diagrams of several PIC micelles, plus the synthesis of mesoporous microspheres using PIC micelles as templating agents. We expect to publish those results once the complete data analysis and data fitting is carried. The latter will require the modification of pre-existing models for the fitting of mesostructured microspheres. Finally, as a proof-of-concept for future measurements, we have studied the synthesis of 1D-mesostructured materials using a THBC.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Phase diagram of micelles made of PAPEO-b-PAA + oligochitosan 2500 g/mol at pH=5.5.
