<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This was the first experiments of my group after the pandemics and I attended in in person, accompanied by Ms Alena Aslandukova and Dr. Denis Vasyukov. During these shifts we analysed a set of majoritic inclusions in diamonds (~11 inclusions) and a few ferropericlase inclusions. Currently, the PI is working on a manuscript using majoritic inclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific report</head><p>The data obtained at id8 is summarised in the figure below.</p><p>Majoritic garnets are shows in circles and these are the only measured inclusions up to date. The data in triangles shows lithospheric garnet inclusions in diamonds, which are more common than sublishospheric. These are the first measurements of such inclusions. Yet, the team decided that these measurements alone are not enough for a high-impact paper, therefore they will be incorporated into a manuscript together with the majoritic garnets or using the data from subsequent experiments at id14.</p><p>As a result of this study we attempted to calculate the oxidation state of the mantle transition zone, addressing the oxygen fugacity of these samples. The corresponding oxygen fugacities for all majoritic garnets were calculated using an equilibrium involving garnet components (grossular, almandine, pyrope, andradite, Mg-majorite) and SiO2. Given reasonable assumptions about SiO2 activity, fO2 values are all well above the IW buffer. This result runs contrary to the common assumption that Fe-rich metal is stable in the transition zone. We suggest that subducting slabs have an important oxidising effect on the TZ and that this region may be more oxidised than previously thought.</p></div>			</div>
