<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We make use of a commercial isotactic polypropylene ( iPP) with M w of 365 kg/mol and a polydispersity Mw/Mn of 5.4, blended with a different amount of special nucleating agents such as sodium 2,2-methyl-ene-bis (4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate, NA11. The composition of polymer blends is 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5wt% of NA11, respectively.</p><p>Shear flow experiments in combination with WAXD were carried out in a Linkam Shear Cell (CSS-450) modified with Kapton windows using a 'short term shearing' protocol to investigate how phase behavior is influenced by increasing of shear rate (time) for pure iPP and in the presence of nucleating agent,NA11.</p><p>Various shear experiments were carried out, varying shear rates as well as shear times in order to keep a constant strain of 60. In order two types of effects have been seen: (a) an effect on the β phase formation in the neat iPP induced by flow that increses with increasing of shear time at the same strain of 60, which is absent during crystallisation in quiescent conditions; (b) a high crystal orientation of the α form in the polymer blends favoured with increasing of shear rates and depending on NA11 concentration. As a result figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, which displays 2D-WAXD patterns and their integrated intensity profiles for pure iPP at different shear times (rates) of the same strain of 60%, shows β phase formation grows upon the shear is applied, as confirmed by appearing of characteristic peak reflection (300) β of this phase. This phase, totally absent during crystallisation without flow application, increases with increasing of the shear time. Unlike the crystals phase of pure iPP, as it is displayed in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> that shows 2D-WAXD patterns of iPP/NA11-0.5wt% as a function of shear rate applied at 145°C, the phase behaviour of iPP in presence of additive confirms the excellent features of NA11 as α form promoter as displayed from the characteristic peak reflections (110) α , (040) α , (130) α of this phase and from the complete absence of peak reflection (300) β of β phase. In addition, as shear is applied to polymer blends in the presence of NA11 an increase in orientation on molecular level can be gained with increasing of shear rate as well as NA11 addition. See figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. and shear times (A) 0, (B) 60 s -1 for 1s, (C) 30 s -1 for 2s, (D) 15 s -1 for 4s, (E) 6s -1 for 10s in order to keep the same strain of 60. It is also reported a comparison between integrated intensity profiles (bottom) of the respective patterns at different shear rates (times) (a) 0, (b) 60 s -1 for 1s, (c) 30 s -1 for 2s, (d) 15 s -1 for 4s, (e) 6s -1 for 10s of the same strain of 60. All images were recorded on cooling at room temperature.
