<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Determination of the spin-orbit constant of 3d transition metals using k-integrated spin-resolved photoemission </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Original motivations and objectives of the experiment :</head><p>The goal of the experiment was to determine the spin-orbit (SO) coupling parameters ξ for a series of 3d transition metals in order to provide non-negligible references in the investigation of theoretical spin-orbit coupling dependent magnetic phenomena. Indeed the SO interaction, namely (ξ &lt;L• S&gt;), has a strong influence on the electronic structure of materials and directly on the spin and orbital moments. In particular the SO interaction has been related to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of magnetic materials containing transition-metal elements, as for instance in van der Laan's model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">δE ~ -¼ ξ S.[&lt;L ↑ - L ↓ &gt;]+ξ 2 /∆E ex [21/2 S.&lt;T&gt; + 2&lt;(L ξ S ξ ) 2 &gt;],</formula><p>showing its great influence on the determination of the magnetic anisotropy of thin magnetic films from XMCD and XMLD experiments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> The high importance of this parameter made us considered that the theoretical values of ξ usually used, should be compared to more accurate values extracted from experiments.</p><p>We proposed to measure systematically the spin-difference valence photoemission spectra of Co, Fe, Cr and Mn in order to relate it to ξ by comparison with a theoretical description of the Fano-effect in the valence band photoemission (VB-XPS) of the respective metals. This was previously tested by some of us on Cu and Ag, where these fully relativistic calculations, based on the one-step-model of photoemission and relativistic multiple scattering theory, were shown to agree quantitatively with spin-and angle-integrated experimental VB-XPS spectra of pure fcc-Cu. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> It was shown as well that the shape and the amplitude of the spindifference are linked to the strength and the diagonal part of the SO coupling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental results :</head><p>To extract the spin-orbit constant ξ, it was necessary to obtain the spin-orbit coupling, ξ&lt;L • S&gt;, averaged over all the magnetic effects and looking at the difference of the valence band spectra in terms of parallel and antiparallel alignment of the photoelectron spin and x-ray photon angular momentum. The spinpolarization of the valence band (i.e. the preferential spatial orientation of the photoelectron spin) has been measured with spin-resolved photoemission provided on ID08 using a 140 mm mean radius hemispherical analyser with a ± 20° angular acceptance, assuming a complete integration over the first Brillouin zone, coupled to a mini-Mott 25kV spin polarimeter whom the high efficiency (Sherman function of 17%) and reliability were essential for these low intensity experiments.</p><p>In the 18 shifts we could prepare and measure three samples (Fe, Cr and Mn). Supplementary in-house beam time gave us the opportunity to extend the series to Co and Ni. Thick films of ~15-20ML were grown at room temperature in-situ in the XPS chamber in order to reach bulk properties, disregarding the orientation and to obtain a randomly magnetic orientation. This last point was important in order to supress the spinpolarisation of the photo-current due to the spin moment. The absence of contribution from the Cu(001) substrate were checked by XAS and the contamination level before and after measurement by XPS. Absorption MCD spectra were taken just before the spin-resolved photoemission measurements in order to verify the randomly magnetic orientation of the thick films. We chose the 600 eV photon energy as the best compromise between cross section evolution and monochromator second order rejection capabilities. Also in the spin-difference spectra, we have to take into account both d→p and d→f contributions that are of opposite sign resulting in a low spin-polarisation effect. Minar et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> showed that with increasing photon energy, the relative weight of the d→p contribution drops rapidly to contribute less than 10% above 50 eV.</p><p>Each sample was measured in spin-resolved photoemission for at least 12 hours. The measurements were corrected from the geometry and both +/-light helicities were considered in order to eliminate the systematic errors introduced by the experimental apparatus. The following figures show the reliable k-integrated spinpolarised photoemission spectra with good statistics for Ni, Co and Fe. The spin difference in the Mn and Cr cases was found too small to be measured with good statistics and reproducibility in the allocated beam time. Their combination with full relativistic calculations done in München to extract accurate spin-orbit constant are underway. The data were reproducible among equivalent samples.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">-1 2 -1 1 -1 0 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0<label>1</label></formula><p>2 -60000 -40000 -20000 0 20000 40000 60000 'LIIHUHQFH %LQGLQJ (QHUJ\ H9 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 1000000 1200000 1400000 1600000 ~5.9% 1L63 Kν H9 (65) ,' 680 3$5 $3$5 4:398 -1 2 -1 1 -1 0 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 'LIIHUHQFH %LQGLQJ (QHUJ\ H9 ~3.6% E 4$!

For the interesting transition metals, the measured spin difference was expected to decrease by a factor of 2 in going to Mn, but already a factor of 4 less is observed between Cu and Fe : Cu=9±1%, Ni=6±1%, Co=4±2%, Fe= 2.3±0.8%. In the same way, only a factor of 2 has been determined between the SO constants of Cu and Fe in the case of ab initio calculations of the magnetic moments of 3d transition metal impurities in and on the (001) surface of bcc Fe <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4]</ref>. These discrepancies may be linked to solid state effects.</p><p>This work should bring new insights on the SO constant values of 3d transition metal that have to be used in the determination of MAE in thin magnetic films for instance. This is the first experimental approach of the spin-orbit constant ξ determination in a series of transition metals over the entire Brillouin zone. These measurements of such small entities were made possible in a reasonable time due to the higher flux and degree of polarisation (~100%) of soft x-rays that is provided now on ID08.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Celine DE NADAI* ESRF Alberto TAGLIAFERRI* Politecnico di Milano, Italy Nicholas BROOKES* ESRF Giacomo GHIRINGHELLI Politecnico di Milano, Italy Jan MINAR* Institut Physikalische Chemie, Muenchen, Germany H.
