<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Anomalous X-ray scattering on a novel amorphous organicinorganic hybrid tin cluster exhibiting nonlinear opitcal effects The experiment was all in all very successful, with minor setbacks. Differential structure factors could be obtained with good statistical quality. One of the obtained ∆S(q) is shown exemplarily in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The setup available at BM02 includes a 2dimensional detector, which enables us to identify small errors in the measurement, such as a shift of the signal due to minor misalignments and counter them. This is extremely helpful for data analysis, since AXS is very sensitive. An example image from the 2-D detector (experiment <ref type="bibr">HC-2213)</ref> showing the compton signal can be seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. For this experiment the 2D detector could not be used, because the efficiency of the detector was too low at the tin edge energy. During the measurements a change in the color of the samples could be observed after prolonged exposure to the beam. Since we were granted extra time for the measurement due to organizational reasons, we had the chance to adjust our strategy and change the sample position regularly to avoid damaging the sample too much. After the experiment we varified that the color change is not temperature induced. Finding out more about the changes in the material including a possible beam energy dependence might lead to the discovery of new properties and uses for the materials and might be subject of futher investigation later on. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>-Universität Marburg Physical Chemistry Faculty of Chemistry Hans-Meerwein-Strasse DE 35032 MARBURG Report:</figDesc></figure>
