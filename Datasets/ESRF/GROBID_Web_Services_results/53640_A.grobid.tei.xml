<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>In the proposal we indicated both dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation experiments on the series of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +Co-based additives samples. We were not able to conduct the rehydrogenation experiments, requiring 120 bar of H 2 pressure, due to the lacks in our experimental set-up. We intended to use the high pressure in-situ cell with the sapphire capillaries tested for up to 125 bar, but it appeared that sapphire absorb strongly in the Co-K-edge energy range. Therefore the glass capillaries were used, with the H2 (desorption) pressure of maximum 3 bar. For the measurements in Ar, the samples were placed in 1.0 mm thick glass capillaries and sealed in the glove-box with the air-tight glue. For the measurements in H 2 , the capillaries were attached to a sample holder enabling connection to the gas line. Before the measurements in H 2 , the samples were evacuated in vacuum at RT, and 3 bar H 2 pressure was set in the capillaries.</p><p>We have conducted decomposition of three samples: Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 2 , Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 3 , and Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoCl 2 in H 2 and Ar atmosphere (CoCl 2 only in Ar). Samples were heated at 5 K/min till 177, 220, and 290 o C. The heating was paused at the indicated temperature steps. The decomposition was followed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption and Raman scattering measurements (green laser). XRD data were collected at the RT, during heating steps, and during the isothermal steps. XAS data were collected at the isothermal steps. Raman data were obtained during all the steps, but after about 160 o C the sample became fluorescent. It might be a good idea to use the red laser with Mg(BH 4 ) 2 .</p><p>XAS spectra of the reference compounds: CoF 2 , CoF 3 , CoCl 2 Co powder, CoO were also obtained. The reference powders were measured diluted with boron nitride to 2 mol% of Co add . The mixtures were pressed into pellets and mounted in aluminum sample holder. To avoid contact with air, the sample holders were covered by Kapton tape adhered by air-tight grease. XAS data analysis was carried out with DEMETER software pack (ATHENA and ARTEMIS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> The spectra were pre-processed in ATHENA (background subtracted, aligned, the step scans were averaged and used for final plots and fitting). Calculation of the theoretical scattering paths in the EXAFS region and fitting were performed with the FEFF6 code <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> using ARTEMIS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-situ PXD</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the in-situ XRD data, obtained for the decomposition of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 2 sample in Ar and in H 2 atmosphere, and of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoCl 2 in Ar, as an example of the obtained data. At room temperature (RT), Mg(BH 4 ) 2 is in γ-phase. At ~150 and ~200 o C we observed γ→ε and ε→β phase transitions, which is in accordance with literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> It appears, however, that in Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 2 in Ar atmosphere the γ→ε phase transition started at a lower temperature. At 290 o C amorphous phases were formed which is the results of either melting or decomposition of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> For this reason, Raman spectroscopy was used to aid in identification of the amorphous (melted?) phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ Raman</head><p>Raman spectra of the two samples, obtained at RT, and at 170 o C, are shown on Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Unfortunately, the sample became fluorescent at the higher temperatures, and it was not possible to utilize Raman spectroscopy to identify the amorphous phases obtained at 290 o C. We suppose that the decomposition phase of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 is fluorescent with 532 Raman excitation wavelength. In the future measurements, red laser should be used for the samples based on Mg(BH 4 ) 2 .</p><p>In the 2900-600 cm -1 region, Mg(BH 4 ) 2 exhibits absorption bands corresponding to the internal vibrations of (BH 4 ) -ions. The B-H fundamental stretching modes are centered at 2321 cm -1 , whereas the bending modes are located at ca. 1404, and 1192 cm -1 . Absorption due to the overtones and combinations of (BH 4 ) -bending are observed at 2535 and 2209 cm -1 . Raman spectra has shown the decrease in the intensity of BH 4 stretching and bending vibrations, which can be related to decomposition of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . It should be noted that the a) b) c) Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In-situ SR-PXD of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 2 decomposition in H 2 (a) and Ar (b), and Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoCl 2 in Ar (c) decomposition of γ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 is expected to occur at &gt;200 o C, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and this result might indicate that CoF 2 decreases decomposition temperature of the compound. The spectra obtained at 160 o C show new vibrations at 2496, 2413, 760, and 467 cm -1 , which can be related to (one of the?) decomposition phases (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ XAS</head><p>The reflections in the in-situ PXD patterns due to CoF 2 and CoCl 2 additives decrease in intensity indicating transformation of the additives (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, no new phases, which could be related to chemically modified Coadditives, were observed. For this reason, XAS spectroscopy at the Co k-edge was used. In situ XAS spectra obtained on Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 2 sample in Ar and in H 2 atmosphere are shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. They confirm that the additive reacted and was transformed to another species. The analysis of other data is in progress. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 +CoF 2 decomposition in H 2 (a,b) and Ar (c,d) The results obtained in this experiment were reported at the two conferences: (oral presentation) O.
