<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Context of the experiment C 70 peapods are carbon hybrid nanostructures formed by C 70 fullerenes encapsulated inside carbon nanotube. It has been shown that the fullerenes can adopt various orientations according to the nanotube diameter. In thin carbon nanotubes, the molecule long axis is parallel to the nanotube axis; the orientation is called "lying". In thick carbon nanotubes, the molecule long axis is perpendicular to the nanotube axis; the orientation is called "standing" <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Electronic properties are predicted to be dependent on the fullerene orientation <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. In a previous work, we showed that X-ray diffraction is a powerful method to determine the structure of a macroscopic sample of C 70 peapods. We estimated the critical nanotube diameter which allows the changing of orientation from the lying to the standing orientation of about 14.2Å <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. In recent papers, we demonstrated that polymerization of C 60 fullerenes is achievable inside carbon nanotube for moderated conditions of pressure and temperature. Typically we used pressure around 1.5GPa and temperature around 500°C <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>. Concerning the C 70 fullerenes, we showed that formation of long polymerized chains does not occur inside carbon nanotubes. We explained this result with geometrical arguments <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The diameter of the nanotube which allows the presence of the C 70 zigzag chains (typical polymer chain observed in the crystal phase) is about 18Å. But the mean nanotube diameter of our sample is about 14.2Å with a distribution of diameter of about 2Å. The thick nanotubes of 18Å do not exist in our sample. We concluded that confinement inside the nanotube prevents the formation of long polymer zigzag chains. On the other hand, we proposed the hypothesis that C 70 dimers could be synthesized inside carbon nanotubes with a minimum diameter of 13.5Å: it could occur in our samples. The aim of the present experiment was to study the possible formation of dimers. We used different thermodynamic pathways from previous study <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref> where no dimerization was evidenced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental part</head><p>Experiments were done on C 70 peapods buckypapers for which the signal from the fullerenes chains is enhanced due to orientation effect. As our experiments a priori only necessitate moderate conditions of pressure and temperature, we used the carbide anvil setup and the resistive setup on the Paris-Edinburgh press. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the main result of the experiment. The lower diffraction diagram (black open squares) is related to the C 70 peapods before treatment.</p><p>The diffraction diagram presents two peaks related to the periodicity of the fullerene chains inside the carbon nanotubes. The first one is situated at 0.57Å -1 and is related to the lying periodicity. The second one situated at 0.64Å -1 is related to the standing one. One can observe peaks from the hexagonal lattice of the peapods bundles. For more information about the analysis of the C 70 peapods diffraction diagram, one can refer to <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The second diffraction diagram (open red circles) is the one obtained after HTHP treatment. The standing peak situated at 0.64Å -1 has mainly disappeared during the treatment. The lying peak seems to be at the same position and with similar intensity. Moreover, a new contribution has appeared around 0.62Å -1 . This peak is related to another structure of fullerenes inside the carbon nanotubes. Analyses are in progress to determine this new structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Experiments allowed us to synthesize a new phase in C 70 peapods under pressure (possibly a dimer phase). The analysis is presently in progress and will be published soon.</p></div>
