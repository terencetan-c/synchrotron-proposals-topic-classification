<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Single-crystal high-pressure high-temperature X-ray diffraction studies of boron carbide B 13 C 2</p><p>Experiment number: HC-1635 Beamline: ID27 Date of experiment: from: 12-02-2015 to: 17-02-2015 Date of report: Shifts:</p><p>Report:</p><p>The aim of the proposed experiment was to perform the single-crystal high-pressure X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of boron carbide, B13C2. Boron carbide is one of the most important superhard materials, since it possesses extremely high hardness together with remarkably low density. In this regard, a detailed structural analysis of boron carbide under high-pressure conditions is required in order to establish the interconnections between crystal structure, bonding scheme and mechanical properties. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was chosen since it can provide very accurate structural details in comparison with powder XRD. Of particular interest is also the stability of B13C2 at high pressures and possible phase transitions or amorphization.</p><p>B13C2 were synthesized at 9 GPa and 1873 K in multi-anvil apparatus installed at Bayerisches Geoinstitut. Two high-quality single crystals of B 13 C 2 together with a small ruby chip were loaded into a BX90-type diamond anvil cell equipped with Boehler-Almax diamond anvils (250 μm culet size). Ne was used as a pressure-transmitting medium. Pressure was determined using the ruby R 1 fluorescence line as a pressure marker and by measuring a position of the (111) X-ray diffraction line of Ne.</p><p>The sample was compressed up to ~70 GPa with a 4-7 GPa step size, at each pressure point the single-crystal XRD was collected. The XRD measurement was carried out in an angle-dispersive mode (λ = 0.3738 Å). Diffraction images were collected using a Perkin Elmer flat panel detector during 0.5° omega-scanning from -40 to +40°. To increase completeness of the dataset at several pressures the single-crystal XRD was collected from both crystals and the corresponding reflection intensities were merged. The data treatment (integration and absorption corrections) was performed with the CrysAlis RED software. The structures were solved by the direct method using the SHELXS software, full matrix least squares refinement on F 2 was performed by means Jana2006 software package.</p><p>The collected data demonstrated high quality. The experimental uncertainties in the cell parameters and the volume didn't exceed 0.1%. The Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>,b shows the volume and axial compressibilities, respectively. The preliminary fit by using the 2 nd order Birch-Murnaghan EOS resulted in the following values: K 0 = 213(5) GPa, V 0 = 329.2(9) Å 3 . While the calculated value of V 0 is in a good agreement with previously reported one (327.53 Å 3 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the estimated value of K 0 is smaller than the value of 231 GPa obtained in ultrasonic studies.</p><p>Similarly to B 4 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the c/a ratio decreases during compression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</p><p>The inconsistency between the intensities of the equivalent reflections (R int ) was within 5%. High quality of XRD data allowed us to solve the crystal structure of B 13 C 2 and refine the atomic coordinates and thermal parameters at each pressure point. The resulting discrepancy (R 1 ) between observed and calculated structure factors varied between 6 and 12%. No signs of phase transition or amorphization were observed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> demonstrates that the crystal retains its quality up to the highest pressure reached. Currently we are analysing the structural data to follow pressure dependence of the bonds' lengths and angles and their influence on the axial compressibility and c/a ratio.  We also made an attempt to synthesise in situ boron carbide by heating pure boron phases (α-and -B) at pressures between 30 and 80 GPa using laser-heating set up installed by us (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). In all cases only -B was obtained. In case of heating of boron in close proximity to the Re gasket we synthesised a novel boride, ReB 4 , whose structure at about 70 GPa has been solved and refined. While with help of the beam-line stuff we collected data of very high quality, some problems where identified: (a) the Perkin-Elmer detector has a too low dynamic range for the single-crystal diffraction data collection; (b) the acquisition time is about 30 min (vs about 5 min using MAR 555 detector at ID09a) and it greatly complicates high-temperature measurements;</p><p>(c) at pressures above about 50 GPa the intensity of the incident X-ray beam is insufficient and its higher intensity would be highly desired.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
