<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Liposomes and bicelles had been previously studied by SAXS, so these studies were focused on the influence of the preparation method in the final structure of lipid vesicles and concentration variation on the formation of bicelles, intended to be a step further in the knowledge of these structures and their applications. Otherwise, saponins are natural surfactants still lacking a deep characterization . In addition, skin samples were analyzed in order to detect the difference of the SAXS patterns of healthy and melanoma affected collagen, as a way to trigger the possibility of cancer detection via SAXS, following the protocol established for breast cancer samples by M. The results are shown in the Figure 1. MLV and sonicated liposomes presented more intense peaks than extruded and microfluidized ones, as a consequence of a higher number of concentric layers in the liposome structure. Also, sonicated liposomes resulted mainly in oligolamellar structure instead of unilamellar. We can observe slight differences in d-spacings as a function of preparation method, being smaller for microfluidized liposomes than for the others. It could mean that some lipid hydrocarbon layers are compressed by the pressure applied . 5 In a second task, bicellar systems were formed of dimyristoyl and dihexanoyl PC (DMPC and DHPC) at different molar ratios ([DMPC]/[DHPC]=3,5 or 2), and final lipid concentrations (15 and 20% w/w).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fern치ndez et al.</head><p>As the path of the scattered beam has a long way in the air, a huge air scattering is affecting the curve (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), which prevented us from a reliable solvent subtraction and analysis. Furthermore, the accessible range truncated the curve in the middle of the scattering peak, making it impossible to get information on the form factor of the bilcelles. Also, the control of temperature, essential to avoid lamellar to bicellar or micellar transitions in these systems, was not available at the station. Thus we cannot be 100% sure of having only bicelles. Our third aim was to determine the differences of collagen in healthy versus melanoma affected skin, which can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> as significant changes between both skins. This preliminary result is similar to those obtained by M. Fern치ndez in the studies of collagen presents on breast cancer tissue .</p><p>3 From these measurements, detailed analysis of these SAXS curves will be performed to achieve full understanding of the structure of the melanoma affected collagen.</p><p>Finally, the experiments on Quillaja bark saponin showed for the first time that the system exhibits enough electron density difference to be studied by SAXS. However, detailed analysis of the curves was not possible due to the air scattering mentioned above. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates the problem and the need of set-up improvements to get good quality results.</p><p>Finally, the experiments on Quillaja bark saponin showed for the first time that the system exhibits enough electron density difference to be studied by SAXS.
