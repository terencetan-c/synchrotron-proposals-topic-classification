<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The proposal aimed at directly determining the evolution of uranium (U) speciation during the last 10 000 yrs in a naturally U-rich (up to 5000 mg/kg) lake catchment in the French Alps. Major issues concerned the mechanisms of long-term U accumulation in the wetland upstream from the lake and the evolution of U speciation over time. This goal can only be achieved by using XAS spectroscopy at the U L III -edge, that is combined in our project with isotopic measurements, dating methods, and mineralogy. Measuring such paleo-speciation of U will yield unique information on the long-term fate of U(IV) in anoxic conditions representative of near/sub-surface contaminated media and repository sites.</p><p>The experiment at the 2-pole wiggler beamline BM23 was thus dedicated to U speciation analysis in wetland soils core samples. The beamtime was splitted into two parts, the first one being dedicated to µXRF mapping in order to localize U a the micro-scale in the soil and µXANES spectra on were collected to determine U redox state in representative microstructures, including biological remains. As detailed in the publication issued from to this beamtime <ref type="bibr">(Lefebvre et al. 2022)</ref>, data were collected at room temperature and the X-ray beam was focused with two mirrors in Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) geometry to a 3 x 3 µm 2 full width at half maximum at sample position. An optical microscope focused on sample position was placed right above the beam for proper tracking of the analyzed spot. The sample was embedded in epoxy resin as for SEM observations but within a N 2 -filled glove bag to prevent exposure to air, covered with Kapton tape to limit oxidation during the experiment and placed perpendicular to the X-ray beam. A continuous N 2 flow was applied on the sample surface to prevent oxidation by air over the course of the experiment. The Si-drift fluorescence detector was placed at a 45°angle between the beam and the sample plane. The incident beam energy was selected using a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator and was set to 17.5 keV for µ-XRF mapping. The emission spectrum energy was calibrated using the Cu Ka and Kb emission lines from Cu tape. The XRF spectra were converted to element-specific fluorescence intensity maps with the PyMca software through batch curve fitting of emission lines of elements of interest (including U La and Fe Ka). We acquired 2x2 mm 2 µ-XRF maps with horizontal 5 µm steps and vertical 10 µm steps, with a counting time of 0.2 s per point. After µ-XRF mapping, U-rich areas of interest were analyzed for their U oxidation state by µ-XANES at the U L 3 -edge. For this purpose, µ-XAS spectra (1000 points, 50 ms/point) were measured from 17.050 to 17.550 keV (17.400 keV for the first spectra), for a total duration of 66 s. Room-temperature beam-damage kinetics (U(VI) photo-reduction) was estimated by acquiring 7 to 10 successive scans on the same spot, at four different locations (see Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, points a to d). Each scan was LC fitted to determine the evolution of U(VI) and U(IV) proportions over time <ref type="bibr">(Figs. S2 and S3 in Lefebvre et al. 2022)</ref>. At all spots, the U(IV) proportion significantly increased over time, ultimately exceeding U(VI) at two spots after 4 to 6 min. These kinetic mea-surements showed that every second scan acquired on the same position was significantly impacted by beam exposure, while the first scan (66 s acquisition time) was always affected by &lt;10 % of relative U(VI) reduction. Proper U redox could thus be determined by LCF of l-XANES spectra obtained by merging individual first scans acquired on pristine spots of a same U-bearing area through successive displacements of &gt; 10 lm between each scan acquisi-tion. To do so, additional l-XRF map were acquired on selected areas where necessary, with horizontal and vertical 2.5 lm steps to obtain more detailed chemical maps. The second part of the beamtime was dedicated to EXAFS spectrsocopy at the U L III -edgein order to determine the molecular environment of U in bulk wetland soil core samples. This EXAFS approach is necessary to complement the µXAS approach because it yields a molecular-level description of U speciation and a quantification of the respective U species. Particular focus was given to the sorption process of U to organic matter and the identification of the functional groups involved in U binding, this by comparison with relevant synthetic organo-U model compounds, using a Linear combination fitting approcah as well as a detailed shell-by-shell analysis. As detailed in <ref type="bibr">(Lefebvre et al. 2022)</ref>, EXAFS data were collected at high k-range for bulk wetland soil samples. In addition, solid residues obtained after 1 M bicarbonate extraction of together with the Lake sediment bulk sample were also analyzed for XANES data. The energy was selected with a Si(1 1 1) double-crystal monochromator and the samples were placed in a liquid He cryostat maintained at a tem-perature of 10 K. XAS measurements were performed in transmission detection mode for the two U-rich soil samples and in fluorescence detection mode with a Vortex silicon-drift energy-dispersive fluorescence detector for the other samples. Between 40 and 121 scans were collected on each sample, in continuous mode at a speed of 6.8 eV/s using a 50 ms sampling time (0.34 eV steps). Variable energy ranges within the XANES to EXAFS region were chosen depending on the samples, which resulted in 2-to 4-min long XAS scans. No beam-damage was observed for any sample under these data collection conditions. All bulk XAS spectra at the U L III -edge were merged, normalized and background-subtracted using the Athena software <ref type="bibr">(Ravel and Newville, 2005)</ref>. The incident beam energy was calibrated by setting to 17,038.0 eV the first inflection point of the yttrium (Y) Kedge transmission spectrum acquired on an Y foil using a double-transmission setup. The EXAFS spectra were binned to a 0.04 Å -1 k-step and deglitched when necessary, and the E0 value was set to 17173.4 eV, which corresponds to the inflexion point of the U(VI) L III -edge. Least-square linear combination fitting (LCF) of XANES spectra at the U L3-edge was performed using a Fortran 90 custom-built software based on a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm, similar to the software used in previous studies from our group as detailed in <ref type="bibr">(Lefebvre et al. 2022)</ref>. Prior to LCF analysis of EXAFS data, a Principal Component Anal-ysis (PCA) of the k 3 -weighted U L III -edge EXAFS spectra dataset of our wetland samples was performed over the 2-12 Å -1 k-range using the SIXpack program <ref type="bibr">(Webb, 2005)</ref>. The PCA was followed by a Target Transform (TT) analysis of our model compound spec-tra database in order to select the most relevant components to perform LCF analysis of the wetland samples EXAFS data. Error analysis and goodness of fit estimators are detailed in <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre et al. (2022)</ref>. Least-square LCF of EXAFS spectra was then performed using a Fortran 90 custom-built software based on a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm, similar to the software used in previous studies, as detailed in <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre et al. (2022)</ref>. The unfiltered experimental k3χ(k) functions were fit in k-space over the 2-12 or 2-10 Å -1 k-range. Fit quality and error analysis is detailed in <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre et al. (2022)</ref>. Shell-by-shell fitting of the unfiltered U L III -edge k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra was performed using a Fortran 90 custom-built leastsquares fitting software based on a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizing algorithm, similar to the code used in previous studies as detailed in <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre et al. (2022)</ref>. Continuous Cauchy Wavelet Transforms (CCWT) of the experimental and fitted EXAFS spectra were calculated using the MATLAB script by <ref type="bibr">Munõz et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr">Munõz et al. ( , 2005))</ref>. In order to decipher between close fit-ting solutions, fit quality of the second neighbor contributions were examined in R space by a reduced chi-square parameter and comparisons of fit solutions were done according to F-tests at 95 or 90 % confidence.</p><p>Our main spectroscopic results indicate that, at the particle scale, U is associated to a variety of organic constituents of the soil matrix with a homogenous oxidation state. Bulk EXAFS spectroscopy at the U LIII-edge shows that U is mostly mononuclear, with dominant monodentate binding to organic moieties (C neighbors at 3.45 A). An additional minor fraction of U under polymeric forms is inferred from wavelet (CCWT) analysis of the EXAFS data. These observations are reinforced by 1 M bicarbonate extractions that result in the dissolution of 82-96 % of total U, including putative polymeric species. Combining these spectroscopic results with isotopic information, our study by <ref type="bibr">Lefebvre et al (2022)</ref> shows that, partial U(VI) reduction to U(IV) occurs as a second step, after sorption onto organic matter. Moreover, the wetland acts as an active reactor where U has been massively accumulating for up to 14500 years, especially as U(VI) forms associated to organic matter, and is further partly exported to the lake through soil erosion.</p></div>		</body>
