<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>developped to measure the height-height correlation function (or capillary-wave spectrum) of the liquid/air interface down to molecular scales. This method was successfully applied during experiments <ref type="bibr">SC-234 (11-16 December 1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">SC-298 (20-24 February 1997)</ref>. It therefore appeared possible to extend such measurements to Water/oil interfaces which are most important because of their practical applications, and also because the very low surface tensions that can be achieved would allow one to observe interesting phenomena beyond the simple capillary effects over a larger wave-vector range. The aim of experiment SC-314 was to attack this very interesting but also more difficult problem.</p><p>This experiment was different from the previous ones and implied the use of a new dedicated twobarrier Langmuir trough made of glass (lower part containing water) and teflon (upper part containing oil) to avoid leaking, equipped with very thin (50p"m) teflon windows for the x-ray beam. The trough was 2cm wide in order to limit the background due to bulk scattering along the beam-path in the oil (hexadecane) that we expected to be the main difficulty of the experiment. We chose to spent two days (5-7 April 1997) to test the new cell and measure the background. It appeared that the cell width was much too small to get any reflection from the interface because of the meniscus curvature and of the small angle of incidence (the critical angle of reflection for the water/hexadecane interface is 0.5mrad or 0.03"). S u se b quent tests showed that the optimal cell width at such small angles of incidence was 7cm and a new cell was built for the June experiment. The energy was fixed at 18keV (X = 0.068nm) were the transmission of the 7cm wide film of hexadecane is z 0.26. The intensity scattered by an interfacial film is (this is in fact an over-simplified expression):</p><p>where F(e) gives account of the normal structure of the inter-facial film (a2 is the normal wave-vector transfer) and &lt; z(Q,~)z(--Q,~) &gt; is the capillary wave spectrum (qZY is the normal wave-vector transfer). If qZ is varied during a scan, as for detector scans in the plane of incidence with fixed grazing angle of incidence, oscillations in F(e) due to interferences between the beams reflected at the water/film and film/oil interfaces provide direct evidence that scattering by film fluctuations are actually observed. If qt is kept constant, as for detector scans in the plane of the sample, the scattered intensity is directly proportional to the capillary wave spectrum. We chose to fix the grazing angle of incidence (using a platinum coated glass mirror) below the critical angle for total external reflection of the hexadecane/water interface because this allows the measurement (and subtraction) of the background by simply lowering the trough and performing the same scan. Using a fixed angle of incidence has the advantage of saving much alignment time (nevertheless over 2 days) as compared to the installation of the crystal beam-deflector necessary for reflectivity experiments, without preventing one from determining the structure normal to the interface which can be obtained from detector scans in the plane of incidence. The detector used throughout the experiment was a NaI(T1) scintillator. The intensity of the 15pm X 300pm was approximately 3 x 106ct/s. Note that the machine mode was the so-called 16 bunch mode which is not the most appropriate for such flux-demanding experiments. We first performed detector scans in the plane of incidence (Fig. <ref type="figure">la</ref>). The amphiphile used was the phospholipid di-palmitoyl-phospshatidyl-choline (DPPC) which forms very stable films at the water/oil interface and can therefore be compressed to high pressures (i.e. low surface tensions), thus giving rise to a large diffuse scattering. The preliminary analysis of the results of ) hows that the fluctuations of amphiphilic films at the oil water interface could be measured up to wave-vectors M 10Sm-'. As expected, the background is very large (and could only be reduced by reducing the cell width) but the subtraction procedure is efficient and reliable enough to allow the measurement of very small signal to background ratios. The structural parameters used to analyse the data of As a conclusion, the results obtained in this first experiment are very encouraging and one can be confident that further improvement of the experimental cell and experimental procedure should make this technique a standard and powerful tool of analysis for liquid/liquid interfaces.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure I: (a) S h c ematics of the experiment.
