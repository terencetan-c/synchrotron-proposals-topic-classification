<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment, we used the newly developed Full Field Diffraction X-ray Microscope on beamline ID01 to study in situ buried micro-cracks in hydrogen-implanted silicon substrates relevant to the SmartCut process.</p><p>The sample we studied consisted in H-implanted Si wafers bonded on Si wafers. A preannealing of 2 hrs at 350 C led to the precipitation of the implanted H atoms in a shallow layer, near the bonding interface, resulting in a layer of micro-cracks that were preliminarly observed using infra-red laser confocal microscopy at the CEA-LETI.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Initially we had planned to study the micro-cracks from the very early stages (step (i) to (ii) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We started by the observations in pre-annealed samples where micro-cracks had already been evidenced using infra-red microscopy. These samples consisted in patterned (32 µm square cavities, sample "AP1") and plain Si wafer bonded to the H-implanted Si wafers (sample "AP2") (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Using this technique quite analogous to dark-field transmission electron microscopy, we imaged the 008 and 228 Bragg reflections in real space using a set of polymer compound refractive lenses (CRL) between the sample and the detector. Given the focal lengths ratio, we expected a</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(i) (ii) (iii) (iv)</formula><p>magnification factor of about x60, i.e. the real space 6 µm pixels of the detector correspond to about 100 nm at the sample position. We chose these reflection to have the largest emergence angle (to decrease the projection of the field of view) while keeping the incidence angle high enough to minimize the path length in the Si wafer (and minimize the attenuation). The largest scattering angle in the horizontal geometry used was also limited by the polarization factor of the horizontally polarized beam. The incidence energy was set to 19.7 keV, which is the 3 rd harmonic of the undulator at ID01. This energy was well-suited for the CRL and for the diffraction geometry. We finally used a double crystal monochromator instead of a multilayer monochromator to achieve the largest energy resolution at the cost of incoming flux. High energy/angular resolution is needed in this study to avoid the wash out out the ineresting signal by the tails of the very intense Bragg peak of the Si substrate.</p><p>Typical imaging scans were performed at constant temperature, using either rocking curves ("phi" angle of the sample) or radial scans across the Bragg reflection. We were able to observe the micro-cracks as well as the cavities in the sample "AP1" simply by imaging near the Bragg peaks of either the implanted or the patterned crystal, taking advantage of the fact that the crystals are slightly misaligned (~0.1 to 0.2 degree in tilt and twist), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.  Using the button furnace, we could also perform the imaging while annealing the sample "AP2" in situ, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. In particular, we could observe single coalescence events in the real-space images. (following lines) FFDXM images from successive radial scans taken at 360C.
