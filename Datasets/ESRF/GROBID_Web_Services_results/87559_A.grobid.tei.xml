<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this work is to study the mechanism of polarisation switching in polycrystalline hybrid improper ferroelectrics by time-resolved diffraction under electric field. Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxides are prototypical hybrid improper ferroelectrics, a promising class of materials for room-temperature cross-coupled multiferroicity, in which electrical polarisation couples to non-polar structural distortions. The mechanism of ferroelectric switching in RP hybrid improper ferroelectrics has been described until now mostly through theoretical analysis; in this experiment, time-resolved diffraction would give insights into microstructure, symmetry, and dynamic response of two Ruddlesden-Popper oxides (Ca,Sr)3Ti2O7 at various stages of the switching process</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained during beamtime:</head><p>Nine sintered pellets were measured as a function of applied field over ten cycles. In total twenty-six data sets were collected on Ruddlesden-Popper oxides Ca2.15Sr0.85Ti2O7. Data was collected every 5000, 3750, 2500 and 1250 ms using the Pilatus detector. Each run consisted of between 100-300 frames. These frames were radial intergrated to extract powder diffraction patterns.</p><p>Analysis of the data has involved performing batch Pawley refinements of the field dependent data to extract the variation of the superstructure peak intensities (that are related to the improper ferroelectric mechanism) and to ascertain if there is any strain coupling (lattice parameter variation). Modulations of intensities are observed at the same frequency of the applied electric field (See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These have been Fourier transformed to extract only the component that oscillates at the same frequency of the applied electric field. To validate the significance of the observed modulations, results have been compared across a series of different pellets and applied frequencies to produce a list of robust intensities. The modelling of the modulation of these intensities will allow us to extract information on the switching pathway in these hybrid improper ferroelectric materials. </p></div>			</div>
