<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The origin of the higly irregular morphology of the phase Ni 3 Si 2 formed during bulk reactive-diffusion in nickel/silicon binary couples is still not understood. This is particularly troublesome since nickel silicides grown by reactive-diffusion are used as ohmic contacts in integrated circuits. When dimensions are reduced, interfacial planarity becomes obviously a matter of concern. In the absence of a theoretical modelisation of this morphological instability, we aimed at experimentally characterizing the Ni 3 Si 2 microstructure in order for us to select among the tentative mechanisms of the instability. Preliminary work on the project indicated that an in-situ and real-time microtomographic characterization should be feasible. On this basis, 9 shifts were allocated for tests to our experiment on the ID19 breamline.</p><p>As regard the original aim of the proposal, that is in-situ and real-time microtomography, the experiments were unsuccesful. This was due to a sample environment problem and not to the X-ray source or X-ray characteristics at the beamline. The practical difficulty of the experiments we performed lies in the fact that both half of the diffusion couple should be maintained in contact in some way in the furnace + tomograph before the reaction begins. It turned out that the sample holder, which we had tested in a furnace providing radiative heating, was not really suited to the particular furnace available at the ID19 beamline. The latter is based on conduction heating and requires that a lot of attention is put on the efficiency of thermal contacts.</p><p>During the duration of the experiments, we never succeeded in achieving high enough temperatures at the sample to start the diffusive-reaction. This problem should however be solved by a different design of the sample holder.</p><p>Yet, some success was achieved when we performed post-mortem tomographic scans of samples we had prepared beforehand in our laboratory. 4 scans were obtained for 4 different durations of the interdiffusion processus : t1 = 6h, t2 = 13h, t3 = 24h and t4 = 48h. All the 4 experiments had been performed at the temperature θ = 750°C. It is clearly seen from the reconstructed images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) that the method efficiently provides a map of the microstructure. From such data volumes, one may easily extract statistical properties of the collection of Ni 3 Si 2 needles such as radius, height, shape. We are still investigating the data in order to check if density variations in the pure silicon phase (into which needles are growing) are measurable.</p><p>As a conclusion, this preliminary round of experiments, although unsuccesfull at providing in-situ and realtime data, proved that microtomography is perfectly suited for characterizing such a complex 3D microstructure as the one we want to study. Given the characteristic sizes,velocities and resolution involved, the feasibility of real-time measurements is assessed.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Morphological instability during reactive diffusion inNi/Si couples : in-situ and real-time micro-tomographic characterization</figDesc></figure>
