<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Using NEXAFS spectroscopy to probe cobalt speciation in solution: relating thermochromism to electronic structure for the non-Co containing IL [C4C1Im][SCN]</p><p>was also recorded. The S 1s NEXAFS spectra for these two ILs were subtly different (not shown here for space reasons), and TD-DFT calculations are currently being performed to understand these differences.</p><p>TD-DFT calculations. Structural calculations for the [Co(NCS)4] 2-complex were performed by the group of Tricia Hunt and TD-DFT calculations were performed on these structures by Nick Besley (TD-DFT calculations for the [Co(NCS)6] 4-complex are on-going). The overall match to the experimental data is excellent; no energyscale shifts were applied to the calculated NEXAFS spectra. In particular, the peak-topeak energy separations in the experimental and calculated NEXAFS spectra match very well, demonstrating the high quality of the TD-DFT calculations performed. Peak 1 corresponds to excitation of beta 1s electrons to singly occupied orbitals. These orbitals are predominantly localised on Co and have d character (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). However, these orbitals also have some p character. Pre-edge transitions are forbidden if the Co atom is in a centrosymmetric environment; symmetry prevents d and p orbital mixing, and transitions to a purely d-type orbital are forbidden. The [Co(NCS)4] 2-complex is tetrahedral, and therefore non-centrosymmetric, allowing such transitions and giving rise to a pre-peak. The intensity of this pre-peak for the [Co(NCS)6] 4-complex is very small (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), as expected for this highly centrosymmetric octahedral complex. Peak 2 was observed for both [Co(NCS)4] 2-and [Co(NCS)6] 4-complexes. For the TD-DFT calculations, this peak was observed both with and without the presence of cationic counterions. Peak 2 corresponds to excitation to unoccupied orbitals componsed of a mixture of Co d and ligand * orbitals. For the isolated anion (i.e. those without cationic counterions), peak 3 has two distinct components. These two bands correspond to excitation to the same unoccupied orbitals; the lower energy band arises from excitation of alpha electrons while the higher energy band corresponds to excitation of the beta electrons. The unoccupied orbitals contain contributions from both ligand * and Co p orbitals. The significant contribution of Co p orbitals explains the relatively large calculated intensities.</p><p>Our experimental results provide a fundamental benchmark for NEXAFS calculations, which is currently lacking. For our TD-DFT calculations, the addition of explicit countercations change details of the outputs, but not the big picture, demonstrating that, once experimental NEXAFS data has been recorded TD-DFT calculations on one gas phase ion is sufficient to capture the electronic environment of the metal complex, at least to a first approximation.</p><p>During this beamtime we also measured NEXAFS spectra for a range of Pd-containing catalysts. These results have already led to a publication. 3</p><p>(1) M. A. <ref type="bibr">White, et al., J. Chem. Educ., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">, 76, 1201.</ref> (2) S.
