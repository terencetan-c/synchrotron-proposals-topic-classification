The asymmetric solution structures of native and patient monomeric human IgA1 reveal new insights on IgA nephropathy. Submitted for publication.</p><p>Abstract: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease in developed countries, in which immune complexes containing IgA1 antibody are deposited in the mesangium and result in glomerular damage. Native IgA1 contains an O-glycosylated 23-residue hinge region that joins its Fab and Fc regions. IgA1 in IgAN has a poorly galactosylated hinge region. Here, the solution structures of monomeric IgA1 from the plasma of a healthy subject and three patients with reduced or elevated O-linked galactose levels were determined. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that all four IgA1 glycoproteins were monomeric with similar sedimentation coefficients s 0 20,w of 6.2-6.4 S. X-ray scattering showed that the radius of gyration Rg significantly increased with IgA1 concentration, indicating self-association, but two peaks M1 and M2 seen in their distance distribution curves P(r) were unchanged with concentration. Neutron scattering in heavy water indicated a similar solution structure, however IgA1 was prone to aggregation. Atomistic modelling based on comparisons of 127,000 and 177,000 conformationally-randomised IgA1 structures with the experimental scattering curves extrapolated to zero concentration revealed similar extended Y-shaped asymmetric solution structures. The modelling suggested that the N-glycans at Asn263 were folded back against the Fc surface, while the C-terminal tailpiece conformations were undefined. The Fab and Fc regions of full-length IgA1 were positioned asymmetrically to allow ample space for the binding of two FcαR receptors to the Fc region. This study of monomeric IgA1 suggested that hinge O-galactosylation and IgAN were linked through the different exposure, flexibility and aggregation of the extended O-galactosylated hinge structures.</p><p>(3) Publication: Wright, D.

In press.</p><p>Abstract: Small angle X-ray and neutron scattering techniques characterize proteins in solution and complement high-resolution structural studies. They are of particular utility when large proteins cannot be crystallized or when the structure is altered by solution conditions. Atomistic models of the averaged structure can be generated through constrained modelling, a technique in which known domain or subunit structures are combined with linker models to produce candidate global conformations. By randomizing the configuration adopted by the different elements of the model, thousands of candidate structures are produced. Next, theoretical scattering curves are generated for each model for trial-and-error fits to the experimental data. From this, a small family of best-fit models is identified. In order to facilitate both the computation of theoretical scattering curves from atomistic models and their comparison to experiment, the SCT suite of tools were developed. SCT also includes programs which provide sequence-based estimates of protein volume (either incorporating hydration or not), and add a hydration layer to models for X-ray scattering modelling. The original SCT software, written in Fortran, resulted in the first atomistic scattering structures to be deposited in the Protein Data Bank, and 77 structures for antibodies, complement proteins and anionic oligosaccharides) were determined between 1998 and 2014. For the first time, this software is publicly available, alongside an easier-to-use reimplementation of the same algorithms in Python. Both versions of SCT have been released as open source software under the Apache 2 license, and available for download from <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/dww100/sct">https://github.com/dww100/sct</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):(1) Rayner, L.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Abstract:The human IgG1 antibody subclass shows distinct properties compared to the IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses, and is the most exploited subclass in therapeutic antibodies. It is the most abundant subclass, has a half-life as long as that of IgG2 and IgG4, binds the FcγR receptor, and activates complement.There is limited structural information on full-length human IgG1 because of the challenges of crystallisation. To rectify this, we have studied the solution structures of two human IgG1 6a and 19a monoclonal antibodies in different buffers at different temperatures. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both antibodies were predominantly monomeric, with sedimentation coefficients s 0 20,w of 6.3 S -6.4 S. Only a minor dimer peak was observed, and the amount was not dependent on buffer conditions. Solution scattering showed that the X-ray radius of gyration Rg increased with salt concentration, while the neutron Rg values remained unchanged with temperature. The X-ray and neutron distance distribution curves P(r) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2, whose positions were unchanged in different buffers to indicate conformational stability. Constrained atomistic scattering modelling revealed predominantly asymmetric solution structures for both antibodies with extended hinge structures. Both structures were similar to the only known crystal structure of full-length human IgG1. The Fab conformations in both structures were suitably positioned to permit the Fc region to bind readily to its FcγR and C1q ligands without steric clashes, unlike human IgG4. Our molecular models for human IgG1 explain its immune activities, and we discuss its stability and function for therapeutic applications.</p></note>
