<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Experiment CH-2391 involved a single visit to station ID31 (12 shifts).</p><p>The experimental work continued our work on a family of compounds that we had discovered were able to undergo a reversible reaction involving loss or uptake of HCl (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These reactions are particularly unusual since they occur within non-porous microcrystalline materials. There is not only an unexpected capacity for migration of HCl through the crystals but dramatic changes in the molecular moieties and crystal structure results from the chemical reaction leading to release or incorporation of HCl. Specifically salts such 3-halopyridinium tetrachlorocuprate containing two planar cations and a distorted tetrahedral anion and converted to a square planar coordination complex trans-[CuCl 2 (3-halopyridine) 2 ] on loss of two equivalents HCl, requiring cleavage of Cu-Cl and N-H bonds, as well as N-H⋅⋅⋅Cl(Cu) hydrogen bonds, and formation of new Cu-N coordination bonds. The reverse process occurs upon re-uptake of HCl. Prior studies at ESRF enabled us to establish the reactions are not mediated by water through use of an experimental design -HCl (g) + HCl (g) N H X M Cl Cl Cl M N M Cl Cl M X Figure 1. Interconversion of halopyridinium salt (3-XpyH) 2 [CuCl 4 ] (left) and halopyridine complex trans-[CuCl 2 (3-Xpy) 2 ] (right).</p><p>13.5 13 12.5 12 11.5 11 10.5 10 9.5 0h 4h 6h 14h 22h 49h</p><p>provided by the station scientists which permitted high quality powder patterens to be obtained using a rotating capillary connected to a cylider supply of dry HCl gas. Studies of the reactions both in situ and ex situ using ID31 enabled us to establish the rate of reaction and helped establish that the reaction is an equilibrium process. The in situ experiments at modest elevated temperatures (370 K) were possible only because of the high flux and resolution provided by ID31. These characteristics also enabled us to suggest that no crystalline intermediate was formed during the recations. These studies were published as a full paper in Journal of the American Chemical Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for the system (3-ClpyH) 2 [CuCl 4 ] / trans-[CuCl 2 (3-Clpy) 2 ] (3-Clpy = 3-chloropyridine) together with gas phase infra-red spectroscopy studies.</p><p>In experiment CH-2391 we focussed on studies to understand the mechanism of the reaction. Specifically, we undertook studies of the reaction of trans-[CuBr 2 (3-Clpy) 2 ] with HCl in order to form a mixed halide product. The aim was to examine the statistical distribution of halide ligands(X) in the halocuprate anion of the product (3-ClpyH) 2 [CuX 4 ]. Ex situ recations were conducted using vapour from aqueous HCl and in situ reactions were conducted using dry HCl gas iand involviong the apparatus described above. The two studies showed consistent results. The flux and narrow line width available at ID31 allowed the Cl/Br ratios to be determined at each site and indicate that the mechanism involves a directing influence of hydrogen bonds between the pyridinium cations and the halocuprate anions that discriminates between chloride and bromide sites. We expect to write an initial publication based upon these results in the near future and aim to follow up with additional experiments of this type, which could be referred to as a chemical labelling approach to exloring the reaction mechanism.</p><p>These studies have led to a number of invitations to speak at conferences both for the PI (Brammer) and for the student, Guillermo Mínguez Espallargas whose PhD project contained these studies. Dr. Mínguez gave invited talks at the British Crystallograohic Association meeting in April, 2008 (just prior to experiment CH-2391) and subsequently at the IUCr meeting in Osaka in August 2008 at which he was able to present the most recent results. Most significantly, however, he was entered for the EuCheMS European Young Chemist Award, which was awarded based upon his CV and upon a research presentation by shortlisted candidates at the 2 nd EuCheMS Congress in Torino, September 2008. He was awarded the gold medal in the PhD student category [2].</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .Figure 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
