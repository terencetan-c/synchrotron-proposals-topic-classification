<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Light-induced nonthermal strain, known as the photostrictive effect, offers a potential application in remote control optomechanical devices. However, the mechanisms behind photostriction remain unsatisfactorily known. One of the reasons for the lack of complete understanding of the mechanism is due to the method used for the measurement; most of them measure strain along one particular direction(B. Kundys) 1 . Here, for the first time, we used rainbow-filtered Laue Micro-diffraction to access the complete strain tensor caused by external laser illumination. An optical setup was implemented on BM32 as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Along with the hutch interlock, the lasers were operated with a separate interlock at all times. The safety goggles correspond to the class and wavelength of the laser were used. A computer-controlled laser beam shutter was used for extra safety as shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>. We investigated systematically the prototypical perovskite PbTiO3 single crystal, chosen as a model system, for several excitation wavelengths, laser power, and temperature in order to understand the mechanism behind photostriction in ferroelectrics. The measurements were done for 3 selected wavelengths: 355 nm, 450 nm, and 808 nm. About 12 shifts were used to complete the room temperature photostrictriction measurements. The last 3 shifts were utilized to set up the oven and perform some temperature-dependent Laue diffraction.</p><p>As an initial test, we performed a time-series mapping of peak positions with and without light illumination to make sure that the light does induce some effect in the PbTiO3 crystal. The position of one of the peaks (far away from the center) is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (a)</ref>. A clear shift in peak position can be noticed when the laser is illuminated on the sample, which was the first validation of our approach.</p><p>To quantify the magnitude of strain and access the full strain tensor, we performed rainbow-filtered Laue diffraction. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (b), (c) and (d), (e) show deviatoric strain components calculated from the Laue pattern fitting for 355 nm and 450 nm laser illuminations, respectively. For 355 nm illumination, it can be observed that there is contraction along the polar axis (c-axis), whereas, the axes perpendicular to the polar axes expands with an increase in laser power up to 1.55 mW. Though the data between 1.55 mW and 8.65 mW are not available, the strain seems to saturate beyond 1.55 mW. The strain variation with respect to laser power for 450 nm illumination follows a similar trend but is not as pronounced as 355 nm. For 808 nm laser illumination, we did not observe any changes, even for 100 mW (not shown here). It is fairly clear that the closer the energy of incident light to the bandgap energy of PbTiO3 (3.87 eV), the higher the strain is. The non-diagonal elements obtained from the Laue pattern fitting are probably due to the measurement uncertainties arising from uncertainty in Bragg angle and the energy of Laue spots, which otherwise would be zero for tetragonal symmetry. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the non-diagonal elements are more or less constant irrespective of laser power.</p><p>Data analysis is still ongoing at the time of the writing, but the results analyzed so far and presented above are very promising. The calculated strain results are very much in line with experimental reports (D. Daranciang et al.) 2 and consistent with the theoretical prediction as well (Paillard et al.). 3 Details of the interpretation are currently under discussion with the main author of the latter C. Paillard who will also join follow-up proposals. Future steps are (i) calculation of the hydrostatic strain components in order to obtain the true strains from the deviatoric components, (ii) analysis of the temperature-dependent experiment to separate any thermal effect from photostriction.</p><p>In summary, this experiment has fully validated our approach to photostriction studies and provided us for the first time with the full strain tensor under laser illumination. This gives us perspective for good quality publications and follow-up measurements.</p></div>
