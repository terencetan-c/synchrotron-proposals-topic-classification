<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This work focuses on TiO 2 :Sn and TiO 2 :N,Sn nanostructured powders for advanced photo-electrochemical applications. A total of 16 samples were analyzed by XAS techniques (XANES/EXAFS) at the Ti K-edge, Sn L 1 -and Sn K-edges at the LISA beamline (BM08). This set of results complements high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction patterns that were collected at the ID-22 beamline in January.</p><p>Analyzed samples. Both pristine, N-doped and N,Sn-copromoted TiO 2 samples were analyzed (Tab.1). Three different synthetic approaches were compared for the preparation of TiO 2 :N,Sn systems: the mechanical mixing of a titania xerogel and nanosized hydrothermal SnO 2 ; the seeded growth of TiO 2 using crystalline SnO 2 germs; a sol-gel approach using both titanium alkoxide and a Sn salt as precursors (bulk approach). All of the prepared samples were finally calcined at 400°C in oxygen flux. Commercial and ad hoc synthesized TiO 2 and SnO 2 samples were also analyzed as references.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

X-ray absorption curves were collected around both Ti K-edge, Sn L 1 -and K-edges at room temperature in He atmosphere at 1 atm. Spectra were recorded in transmission mode after diluting (when necessary) the powder in cellulose to avoid thickness effects. Fluorescence spectra could not be collected due to experimental problems with the detector. A Si (111)-monochromated beam was employed in the 4.87-5.71 (Ti K-edge), 4.39-4.85 (Sn L 1 -edge) and 29.0-29.9 keV (Sn K-edge) energy ranges. Ti foil and Sn foil were analyzed as references for Ti and Sn K-edge spectra. Selected samples were analyzed also under in situ irradiation with a UV halogenide lamp (Jelosil HG 500 W). The Horae suite of programs, based on the IFEFFIT library, was used throughout data processing and fitting.</p><p>Main results. In the Sn-containing samples from the bulk series, the edge energy, E 0 , of Sn L 1 -edge spectra is slightly shifted (+2 eV) toward higher energies with respect to the reference SnO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Moreover, the near-edge features above the white line show a different Sn coordination geometry with respect to the pure SnO 2 reference. The other two series present Sn L 1 -edge spectra comparable to the reference pure cassiterite. Slight changes in the Sn L 1 -edge spectra were observed upon UV irradiation which could be attributed to a partial reduction of Sn centres. The Ti K-edge EXAFS spectra are mainly influenced, as expected, by the different phase composition of the samples, in terms of anatase and rutile content (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). The results of preliminary least-squares fittings shows that the bulk series presents appreciable distortions in the first coordination shell as a function of the Sn content (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>), which are instead scarcely appreciable in the mechanical mixing and seeded growth series. Nitrogen has instead just immaterial effects, confirming previous considerations made on the basis of HR-XRPD data. Also UV irradiation has no effect on the average Ti geometry. The Sn K-edge spectra of bulk samples display almost unchanged average &lt;d Sn-O &gt; distances in the anatase matrix at low Sn loadings, while they undergo an abrupt shortening at higher ones. This is consistent with an increase of the average oxidation state of Sn ion. In conclusion, the present experiment complemented and supported the outcomes of the experimental session at ID22. We demonstrated that the adopted synthetic strategies are able to control the microstructure in terms of both phase composition and concentration of defects, which in turn imply significant changes in both the long-and short-range structures. Furthermore, the operando measurements provided evidence of electron transfer mechanisms taking place upon UV light irradiation. We are currently developing an interpretative framework to correlate these structural and microstructural insights to the observed optical and electronic properties.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Experiment title :</head><label>title</label><figDesc>Probing local and long-range structure of N-doped TiO 2 -based composite (TiO 2 , Sn/SnO 2 ) materials for advanced photo-electrochemical applications Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Daniela Meroni* , Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Silvia Ardizzone, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Luca Rimoldi* , Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Leonardo Lo Presti* , Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Laura Loconte, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy</figDesc></figure>
