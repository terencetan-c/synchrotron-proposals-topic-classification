<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>High pressure EXAFS studies on Fe and Ge bearing amorphous and quasicrystalline materials </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>EXAFS is a powerful technique for measuring element-specific bonding changes, We conducted an extremely productive pilot study using high pressure energy-dispersive EXAFS techniques to study two archetypal 4th row elements: Ge and Fe. We looked at a number of model materials: Ge, GeO 2 glass, and FeGeO 3 . Crystalline Ge undergroes a number of pressure induced transitions including structural and electronic changes. We studied this material up to 60 GPa (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Variation of the energy of the edge position of Ge as a function of pressure confirms the transition from an insulator to metal at around 10 GPa (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The known crystal structures for Ge from XRD provide an additional validation of the EXAFS analysis.</p><p>A preliminary quantitative analysis has been performed up to 60 GPa, The backscattering amplitude and the photo-electron mean free path were calculated by FEFF6 and the three first Ge-Ge bond lengths were used to Fig. 2</p><p>fit experimental data in R space (range 1.5-3.3 Å) with the Artemis software. Considering a constant evolution of the Ge-Ge bond lengths with pressure we define each Ge-Ge distance as R Ge-Ge =R Ge-Ge (calc)+a R Ge-Ge (calc) and the EXAFS Debye-Waller factor as σ 2 1 = σ 2 2 =σ 2 3 . The fit were performed using "a" and σ 2 1 as free parameters .The decrease in the Ge-Ge distances, described by the pressure behavior of the "a" parameter (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), is in good agreement with the XRD results. The anomaly in the pressure behavior of a between 10-13 GPa is the signature of the structural transition from the diamond to the β-Sn phase which occurs in the system contemporaneously with the electronic transition. The pressure evolution of the σ 2 1 suggests the onset of a new structutal phase transition above 60 GPa (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>The structure of amorphous GeO 2 has previously been studied by EXAFS to 29 GPa and XRD to 15 GPa. We extended the study of GeO 2 to 44 GPa (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) over several increasing and decreasing pressure cycles. A preliminary analysis of data was performed up to 44 GPa. The Ge-O bond lengths were calculated by FEFF6 using the quartz and the rutile structure previously used to describe the structural phase transition in crystalline GeO 2 . The GeO 2 data were fit over the range from 0.6 to 1.9 A with the mean value of the R Ge-O and σ 2 as free parameters. The pressure evolution of the R Ge-O distance was found to increase up to 30 GPa (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) suggesting that the transition from a quartz-like to a rutile-like structure is complete at 30 GPa in amorphous GeO 2 , whereas it occurs above 8 GPa in the crystalline compound. 5 Fig. 6 Fig. 5 </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Ho-Kwang David MAO, Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington* Prof. Wendy MAO, Stanford University* Dr. Sakura PASCARELLI, ESRF* Dr Guoyin SHEN, HPCAT, Carnegie Institution of Washington* Dr. Wenge YANG, HPCAT, Carnegie Institution of Washington*</figDesc></figure>
