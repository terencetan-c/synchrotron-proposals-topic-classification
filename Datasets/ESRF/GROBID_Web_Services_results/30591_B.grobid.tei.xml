<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this report we describe a setup of an optical tweezer (OT), which is able to fix a single sample entity in a liquid filled capillary and to perform a scanning micro-diffraction experiment on it. As a demonstration experiment -an example for a colloidal system -a small cluster of multilamellar phospholipid vesicles was fixed in the X-ray beam and the diffraction of micron sized vesicle cluster is measured with a micrometer beam.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The sketch of the setup applied for the micro-diffraction X-ray experiments with optically trapped microparticles in front of the focused X-ray beam is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. We use a single mode CW fiber laser that generates a collimated linear polarized beam at 1064 nm. The beam is directed to the active area of the spatial light modulator (SLM) to control the phase of the wave front by means of a pre-calculated diffractive optical element (DOE) which is computer addressed to the SLM. The DOE allows to control the convergence and the shape of the laser beam which is then reflected by the dichroic mirror to the microscope objective and focused inside a thin walled glass capillary of 100 µm diameter. Particles immersed in water are fluxed inside the capillary by a syringe pump and trapped at the location of the focused laser beam. The working space is imaged by a second microscope objective (40x) on a CCD. The focused X-ray beam (1 µm) is directed orthogonal to the trapped particle in the capillary. Multilamellar vesicle dispersions of Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-Phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) (20 w%) and water were prepared according to standard procedures. Prior to the experiment, the stock solution was diluted with a 0.1 mM CaCl 2 solution to obtain the final used concentration of 1 w%. This solution was transferred by the remote controlled syringe pump into the capillary held at room temperature. Using the optical tweezers the liposome vesicles were optical sorted until a cluster size of 10 µm had been reached and fixed afterwards in the X-ray beam. A typical diffraction pattern of the 10 µm large POPE cluster taken with an exposure time of 5 s is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. The used exposure time is close to the limit of the radiation damage as tested on a small cluster fixed to the capillary wall. But only single exposures are taken in one position and consequently the radiation damage can be neglected for the used experimental conditions. The measured diffraction ring of the unoriented liquid crystalline phase L α is demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. From the azimuthally integrated 2D diffraction pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) the d-spacing was determined to be 5.29 nm by fitting a Lorentzian onto the 1 st order diffraction peak. The d-spacing corresponds well to published literature values <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . The integrated intensity under the peak is a direct measure of the liposome concentration seen by the X-ray beam. For demonstrating the capabilities of the OT and to measure the size of the cluster, a scanning diffraction experiment was performed with a step size of 2.5 x 5 µm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the obtained results. The first two figures show the microscope images of the intense IR laser beam used for trapping (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and the image taken immediately after turning off the trapping laser to visualize the size of the trapped laser (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). respectively. A cluster size of 10 x 10 µm 2 has been deduced in the horizontal plane. Additionally some small clusters are visible which are neither in the focal plane nor in the plane of the X-ray beam. Overmore the upper half of the images, the meniscus of the liquid inside the capillary is seen. The result of the scanning diffraction experiment is given in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>, which is performed in the vertical plane. Here the integrated intensity under the 1 st order reflections is given as a function of the scanning position. The high intensity regime (dark) corresponds to the POPE cluster, of which the size has been determined with about 10 x 10 µm in vertical plane. The agreement with the cluster dimension measured with microscopy is good. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1.
