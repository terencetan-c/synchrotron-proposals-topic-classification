However although the crystals diffracted to better than 2.5 Å, there was disorder and splitting which had not been clearly seen on the home source. Despite screening quite a few crystals none were suitable for MAD experiments. One crystal mounted late on was better than the others and a data set was collected. This has been processed and has an Rmerge of 8% between 7 and 2.2 A and reasonable completeness. Molecular replacement with a 50% homologous protein has given a good signal (corellation of 0.355 in Molrep next solution 0.227) and there is density for non-identical side chains truncated to Ala. Rfree is staying relatively high in refinement at present particularly for the low resolution data and poor spot shape is still a problem with this crystal, so another data set may be necessary to get good refinement. Crystallisation of complexes with binding partners is being pursued.</p><p>Since the above report was submitted in February an improved native data set has been collected at SRS Daresbury using altered freezing conditions. This gave a data set that has allowed the structure to be solved to 1.75 Å with R=20.3 Rfree=23.0, with the molecular replacement solution reported above. A manuscript is close to submission and complexes are under investigation. A fuller scientific report will be submitted in February 2002.</p></div>		</body>
