<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>The aim of this project is to investigate the structural basis of the Frank-Starling law of the heart, stating that the force during the contraction (systole) is adapted to the volume attained by the ventricle at the end of the relaxation (end-diastolic volume). At the level of the sarcomere, the 2 µm long structural unit of heart muscle cell, in which myosin motors, extending from the thick filament, work cooperatively to generate steady force and shortening by cyclic ATP-driven interactions with the interdigitating actin filaments, the Frank-Starling law consists in the increase of the force of contraction with the increase in sarcomere length, SL (length-dependent activation, LDA). Thus to record the SL changes accompanying the mechanical output together with the structural signals from the thick and thin filaments during the systolediastole cycle is a crucial prerequisite of the investigation. This is achieved by the combination of fast sarcomere mechanics for intact trabeculae with the possibility offered at beamline ID02 to vary the sampleto-detector distance from 0.6 to 31 m to record both the nanometer-scale signals originating from the two arrays of myosin motors in each thick filament and the micrometer-scale changes in the length of the sarcomeres interrogated by the X-ray beam. In previous visits <ref type="bibr">(LS-2576</ref><ref type="bibr">, Nov 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">LS-2512</ref><ref type="bibr">, Feb 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">LS 2450</ref><ref type="bibr">, Oct 2015)</ref> we showed that in the heart as in the skeletal muscle (1) a dual filament mechanism of regulation of contraction operates: the canonical Ca 2+ -dependent thin filament activation, making the actin sites available for binding of the myosin motors, and the mechano-sensing in the thick filament (2), acting as a downstream gearbox that adapts to the load the recruitment of the myosin motors from their energetically convenient OFF state (3,4). In a heartbeat, unlike during skeletal muscle tetanic contraction, the rise of internal [Ca 2+ ] is transient and may not reach the level for full thin filament activation, thus the mechanical response depends on both the internal [Ca 2+ ] and the sensitivity of the thin filament to calcium (5,6), parameters that are under the control of several regulatory systems like LDA and phosphorylation of contractile, regulatory, and cytoskeletal proteins. During visit LS-2650 we aimed at investigating how the regulatory state of the thick filament in an electrically paced intact cardiac trabecula changes in diastole in relation to inotropic interventions like the increase in sarcomere length (SL) from 1.9 to 2.3 µm, obtained by either slowly lengthening the trabecula to avoid large passive force development or by imposing a force step up to 0.15 the force at the peak of an isometric twitch.</p><p>Methods. Heart trabeculae are dissected from the right ventricle of the rat and mounted in a thermoregulated trough perfused with oxygenated solution (1.2 ml/min, 27°C) between the lever arms of a strain gauge force transducer and a loudspeaker motor carried on the moveable stage of a microscope. SL is measured with a 40x dry objective and a 25x eyepiece. The length of the trabecula is adjusted to have an initial SL of ~2.1 μm (L0 length). A pair of mylar windows is positioned close to the trabecula, about 1 mm apart, to minimize the X-ray path in the solution. The trough is sealed to prevent solution leakage and the trabecula is vertically mounted in the beam path. Trabeculae are electrically stimulated at 0.5 Hz to produce twitches. A FReLoN CCD detector is placed at 31 m from the preparation to collect the first orders of the sarcomeric reflections with 1.6 ms time windows. Change in SL (range 1.95-2.25 μm) is achieved by changing the trabecula length by about ± 8% L0 and recording the corresponding sarcomeric reflections. Sarcomeric reflections are also recorded during the lengthening response to force steps imposed starting from SL of 1.95 μm, the amplitude of which is chosen to attain a final SL of ca. 2.25 µm. The detector is then moved to 1.6 m and the same manoeuvres are repeated to collect up to the 6th order of the myosin-based meridional reflections (5-10 ms time windows).</p><p>Results. The X-ray data collected with LS-2650, integrated with those of LS-2576, provided an adequate statistics for the demonstration that the spacing and fine structure of all the meridional myosin based reflections (the M1, also contributed by the Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C), the M3 originating from the axial repeat of the myosin motors; the M6 from the backbone periodicity, and the M2, M4, M5 forbidden reflections due to an axial perturbation induced by the MyBP-C) do not change with increse in SL from 1.95 to 2.25 μm (accompanied by increse in passive force from 0 to 0.06 the force at the twitch peak (Tp) at 2.25 μm). The intensities of all reflections, corrected for the effects of the change of diffracting mass in the X-ray beam, increase by 10-15% with the increase of SL. A similar intensity increase is shown by the first order myosin layer line (ML1), originating from the three stranded quasi-helical symmetry of myosin motors on the surface of the thick filament. When the longer SL of 2.25 µm is obtained with a force step (complete in 10-40 ms) to 0.15 Tp, we did not find any changes in the spacing and fine structure of the meridional reflections with respect to both the shorter SL and the same SL with lower passive force (no step). The intensity of the reflections was about the same at the same SL independent of the passive force (0.06 Tp, no step, 0.15 Tp step). These results contradict recent X-ray results showing that SL affects the thick filament structure (7,8) and give further evidence to the view that the sarcomere length sensitivity modulating the performance of the heart in systole is not based on changes in the thick filament structure in diastole, reinforcing the new view of the Frank-Starling mechanism that a rapid stress-dependent thick filament regulation adjusts the energetic cost of the heart beat to the ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation, independent of the enddiastolic SL (2). </p></div>
