<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Supported bimetallic nanoalloys, containing two metallic species, exhibit substantially different, often enhanced, properties compared to their monometallic analogues, which makes them very attractive for technical applications, especially as catalysts. Precise control over structural parameters such as (a) size dependent compositional variation, (b) morphology and (c) mono-dispersity of particle size are crucial to fully harness the catalytic power of these bimetallic nanoalloys. Conventionally, supported nanoalloys are prepared by wet-impregnation (C Im ) methods using an aqueous solution containing two metal precursors. Catalysts prepared by this route can contain metallic entities ranging from sub-nm clusters to particles a few microns in size. To overcome this broad size distribution problem, sizecontrolled nanoalloys, have been prepared in aqueous solutions in the presence of stabilizer ligands, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). Then these particles are immobilized onto a solid oxide support to form catalysts with almost all the metal particles within the 2-10 nm range (i.e. sol-immobilization (S Im ) method). However, supported nanoalloys prepared by the S Im method still tend to exhibit a size dependent compositional variation. Recently, Sankar et al. reported an excess anion modification of the C Im method, (modified impregnation (M Im ) method) for the synthesis of supported goldpalladium nanoalloys, which afforded a more precise control over the size, composition and morphology of these nanoalloys. In this beamtime we performed EXAFS measurements at the Au L 3 and Pd K-edges in order to unravel the structure of AuPd catalysts prepared by this M Im method. These data were subsequently compared with Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) data on the same samples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The resultant bimetallic coordination numbers from an analysis of the EXAFS data are given below. For the 1% AuPd/TiO 2 (M Im ) sample, confirmation of the presence of bimetallic species can be seen immediately from the Fourier Transform (FT) data at both edges (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Two intense peaks in the FTs are observed as a consequence of a 'π phase flip' in the backscattering amplitude from 6 Å -1 for Au (or indeed for all elements where Z &gt; 78) resulting in a splitting of the major contribution in the FT into a high and low r component. This occurs when two elements are present in equivalent amounts; often the splitting and intensity of the low R contribution becomes more intense with an increasing number of bimetallic bonds. A mismatch in the total coordination number from an analysis of the Au L 3 -edge (7.3) and Pd (3.0) K-edge data is testament to a large number of Au-Au contributions due to the presence of large (~µm sized) clusters in the sample in addition to bimetallic species. From a Pd K-edge perspective the smaller overall coordination number suggests that much of the Pd is associated with Au although the higher Au contribution (consistent with STEM data) suggests these larger species to be Au-rich. These observations clearly indicate that EXAFS is a complimentary technique to electron microscopy for characterizing these supported bimetallic nanoalloys. From the above characterization data, it is evident that the bimetallic catalysts have a homogeneous random alloy structure. The substantial enhancement in the catalytic activity of these catalysts, often termed as synergistic effect, could be the result of the intimate mixing of two metals in the bimetallic crystals. This observed synergistic effect has been hypothesized to occur as a result of either the formation of unique metal (A)metal (B) bonds, often termed as an ensemble (geometric) effect, or a change in the electronic state by the formation of metal (A)metal (B) bonds in the surface or a combination of both. With the currently available evidence, it is not possible for us to prove/disprove either of the two hypotheses, however efforts are underway to understand the reason for this remarkable measured synergistic effect.
