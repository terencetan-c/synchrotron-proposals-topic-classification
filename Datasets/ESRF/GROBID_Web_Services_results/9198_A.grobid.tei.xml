<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the metallic antiferromagnet GdS the Gd3+ ions occupy the sites of a fee lattice. Due to the 8S~ ground st ate of Gd3+ GdS is expected to behave as an isotropic Heisenberg system. However, , magnetisation measurements reveal a significant amount of biquadratic exchange interaction <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. It was the aim of this experiment to study the critical behaviour close to the Ndel temperature and to search for deviations from the Heisenberg critical exponents caused by the biquadratic exchange interaction.</p><p>During our measurements we encountered serious experimental problems, namely temperature instabilities of the sample during injections. Since the storage ring was running in single bunch mode with an injection every eight hours, we were forced to measure a complete temperature dependence in eight hours as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As planned we performed measurements with high momentum space resolution close to the Neel temperature using a Ge (111) analyser crystal. The aim of this experiment was to determine the critical exponents y and u of GdS from the magnetic critical scattering. We expected the crossover within a few tenth of a degree Kelvin from TN where the width of the diffuse component becomes comparable to the instrumental resolution.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the temperature dependence of the square root of the integrated intensity of the (f f $) Bragg peak. The fit to the intensity gives TN = 57.03 f 0.01 and ,8 = 0.384 f 0.005. The value of /? is close to 0.367, the value for a three-dimensional Heisenberg model. Close to the Neel temperature we observed a broadening of the signal. This was caused by magnetic diffuse scattering and an independent non magnetic phenomena. For this reason we measured the Bragg scattering 50 eV away from the resonance energy as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Below the Neel temperature the weak non-resonant magnetic scattering is observed, above a non-magnetic non-resonant peak remains. The origin of this signal is not yet understood.</p><p>As a first step in the data analysis this non-magnetic non-resonant peak was subtracted. After this correction a sharp and a broad component is observable above the Neel temperature as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Similar observations were reported from other magnetic systems <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. Because of the bad statistics, caused by the above mentioned technical problems, and the small difference between the two components, the separation failed. Also the attempt to describe the broad component with an Heisenberg model to reduce the number of parameters for the separation failed.  In conclusion we were able to measure critical fluctuations close to the Nkel temperature. We observed a sharp and a broad component but a separation and therefore an evaluation of the critical exponents was not possible. We observed a non-resonant non-magnetic signal at the same position as the magnetic peak over a wide temperature range.</p><p>[l] Kobler et al, private communication [2] Thurston et al, <ref type="bibr">Phys.
