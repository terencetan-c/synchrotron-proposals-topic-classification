The samples contained ~1000 ppm of Pu sorbed to the surfaces of iron oxide minerals: hematite, goethite, and magnetite. The mineral substrates comprised aluminium-doped minerals, minerals with decreased crystallite sizes, and "reference" minerals that were more chemically pure and with crystal sizes in the micrometre range. These experiments were carried out to determine the effects of mineral complexity, impurities (Al-substitution) and particle size (nanoscale crystallites), on sorption and redox behaviour of Pu. Pu was introduced to the mineral aqueous suspensions as Pu(V) in the laboratories at HZDR. The successful measurements revealed that in some cases, Pu is present in more than one oxidation state from a qualitative comparison with reference compounds of known oxidation states. In essence, our results suggest that some samples contained a mixture of Pu(IV) and Pu(V). Picture on the left below shows a qualitative comparison of a Pu + mineral sample and two reference compounds, suggesting contributions from more than oxidation state of Pu. Picture on the right below shows a preliminary (not final) quantitative assessment of contributions from Pu(IV) and Pu(V) likely to be present in the sample. Data analysis in ongoing for a quantitative determination of the oxidation states present in the samples and their fractions. We also report the successful measurements of Pu at the L3-edge in HERFD-XANES mode at beamline BM20. M4 and L3-edge measurements will be compared to determine potential correlations between the M and L edges with respect to oxidation state and/or speciation of Pu. </p></div>			</div>
