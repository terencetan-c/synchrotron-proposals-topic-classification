<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Most of the catalysts used in industry nowadays consist of very small metallic particles highly dispersed on oxide supports prepared by wet chemical process. 3 key parameters that are directly influencing their performance are now well known and documented: the size of the metallic particle (molecular cluster versus larger nanoparticles)</p><p>the composition and structure of the mono and bimetallic particles (alloy versus segregated core-shell)</p><p>the nature of the support (non reducible SiO 2 versus reducible TiO 2 )</p><p>In order to design new catalysts the specific role of each of these factors separately and in combination with the two others needs to be carefully and systematically monitored. However, due to the high heterogeneity of chemically prepared systems this task remains very difficult. Moreover very small molecule-like clusters that are expected to feature enhanced reactivity are in general very difficult to obtain with conventional chemical methods. Our interdisciplinary research project 'Clusters and Catalysis' gathering 4 laboratories at K.U.Leuven (B) proposes to overcome these limitations by using a novel physical method to synthesize series of supported metal catalysts with a controlled and highly reproducible homogeneity. The cluster deposition setup is based on a dual-target dual-laser vaporization source optimized for the production of mono and bi-metallic clusters. 1-2 Size-selection is achieved with a quadrupole size filter and low deposition energy ensures that clusters on supports retain their original size and shape. To prevent any aggregates formation on the oxide surface, the cluster coverage is limited to 0.05-0.1 ML. We are now producing series of size-selected mono-and bi-metallic Au and Pt-based gas phase clusters (&lt; 4.0 nm) deposited on the surface of flat SiO 2 and TiO 2 substrates on top of Si wafers. The morphology of the clusters is studied routinely by atomic force tunneling and transmission electron microscopies (AFM and TEM respectively).</p><p>(Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>)</p><p>The main goal of this preliminary beamtime was to assess the capacity of ID26 to measure XANES of highly diluted samples (∼0.05-0.1 ML) deposited on 2D surfaces (versus 3D volume as for conventional chemical process) using the high energy resolution fluorescence detection mode (HERFD).</p><p>For this purpose monometallic Au and Pt clusters samples of as well as Au0.5/Pt0.5 bimetallic clusters (3-4 nm) deposited both on SiO 2 and TiO 2 substrates have been investigated as-prepared in air. In a second stage we have implemented the in situ cell available at ID26 to measure the same samples under different gas atmospheres: pretreatment of the samples under He flow followed by a subsequent flow of CO and O 2 (CO oxidation condition). All measurements have been carried out at room temperature using the same experimental setup both at Au and Pt L 3 -edges. L β emission lines for Au and Pt (11565 eV and 11232 eV) have been measured using the same bending crystal analyser Si (844). HERFD spectra were collected using the emission spectrometer equipped with the new crystal analyser Ge (11 11 11).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> that presents the HERFD-XANES spectra of monometallic Pt cluster (average size of 2.5 nm) on SiO 2 substrates (0.05 ML) measured as prepared and in He and CO+O 2 mixture flows demonstrates the high quality of the measurements. Preliminary analysis of the XANES spectra shows that the as-prepared Pt clusters are apparently consisting of a metal core covered by an oxide shell that is partly reduced in the He flow. Limited changes upon CO oxidation conditions can be observed with no significant re-oxidation. A detailed analysis at both Au and Pt L 3 -edges is currently underway to unravel the structural changes affecting the bimetallic Pt/Au NPs and the influence of the support and composition on the electronic state and structure of the clusters.</p><p>This preliminary investigation has demonstrated the remarkable capacity of ID26 to measure XANES of extremely low loading of mass-selected deposited mono-and bi-metallic Au/Pt clusters. Moreover the high resolution XANES measured both at the Au and Pt L 3 -edges under He and CO oxidation conditions (CO+O 2 ) has pointed out significant structural and oxidation state changes occurring in Au, Pt and Au/Pt clusters according to the gas atmosphere and the support. These very promising results confirm the validity of our project. They also show that a more detailed and systematic investigation of the activation/reduction in H 2 /He as well as the adsorption processes of individual CO and O 2 gases with XANES and RIXS are needed. A more extensive ID26 beamtime will allow us to get a better understanding of the complex changes occurring in these bimetallic systems as a function of the cluster size, composition and the support type.</p><p>(1) Bouwen, W.; Thoen, P.; Vanhoutte, F.; Bouckaert, S.; Despa, F.; Weidele, H.; Silverans, R.
