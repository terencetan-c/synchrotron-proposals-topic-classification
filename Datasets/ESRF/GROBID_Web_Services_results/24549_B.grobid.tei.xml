<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The femABX protein family is constituted by enzymes involved in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan, the major component of the bacterial cell wall. These proteins catalyze the addition of an aminoacid on the petidoglycan precursor by using aminoacylated tRNA as a substrate <ref type="bibr">(ref. 1)</ref>. As this mode of action is unusual and has no equivalent in other steps of cell wall synthesis, we propose to develop antibiotics that will act on these novel targets. In the context of this project, that involves 3 laboratories of the University of Paris VI and has been financed by the "Ministère de la Recherche" (ACI "Molécules et cibles thérapeutiques"), we investigated the biochemical and structural studies of members of the FemABX family, particularly two ligases in Enterococcus faecalis, <ref type="bibr">BppA1 and BppA2 (ref. 2)</ref> and the homolog, FemX of Weissella viridescens (ref. 3). Date of experiment 13 July 2002 / 15 July 2002 Crystals of a seleno-methionine derivative of Weissella viridescens FemX have been obtained and diffract to 2.1 Å resolution. During these 5 shifts of the 30-01-602 experiment, data were collected at the selenium peak and inflection wavelength. Because of the 16-bunch beam mode and weak diffracting crystals (3 minutes exposition was necessary), we could not collect diffraction data at remote wavelength. The statistics of the data collection are summarized in Table I. peak inflection Resolution (Å) 2.1 2.1 wavelength (Å) 0.98064 0.980973 sweep (°) 360 180 No. of observations 154237 77417 No. of unique reflections 20691 20758 R sym (%)</p><p>4.4 (13.9) 5.7 (13.1) Multiplicity 7.5 (7.5) 3.7 (3.8) Completeness (%) 99.9 (99.9) 99.9 (99.9) I / σ (I) 7.5 (6.2) 8.3 (4.8)</p><p>Table I. Statistics of data collection. The values in parenthesis are for the highest resolution shell (2.2 -2.1 Å) Thanks to the high data quality, the structure was finally solved by SAD method at the peak wavelength using the program CNS. Nine sites could be localized in the anomalous Patterson synthesis. Heavy atom refinement and phasing to 2.1 Å resulted in phases with a figure of merit of 0.406 and a phasing power of 1.70. After density modification, the map was submitted to the automatic wARP procedure. The resulting atomic model was completed using O (Jones &amp; Kjeldgaard, 1997) and refined with CNS. The structure was then refined against the native data to 1.7 Å resolution (see report 30-01-602, date of experiment 13 June 2002 / 14 July 2002). Statistics of the refinement are summarized in Table II. Crystallization and structure determination of FemX have been published (Biarrotte-Sorin et al, 2003).
