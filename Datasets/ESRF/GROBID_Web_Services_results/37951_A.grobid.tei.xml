Frank de Groot, Ad van der Eerden, Prof.dr. Bert Weckhuysen, Department of Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Utrecht University, The Netherlands Experimentalists Emiel de Smit*, Dr. Andy Beale*, Elena Sacaliuc*, Dr. Ana Iglesias Juez*, Department of Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Utrecht University, The Netherlands Report: (max. 2 pages) This beamtime was a continuation of a previous beamtime (26-01-779: XANES and EXAFS study of the activation and deactivation of Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch Catalysts). During the present beamtime, work was focused on gaining insight into the iron phases present in Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts under working conditions. Therefore, the main part of the time was spent on collecting in situ XAFS/WAXS data during the activation and reaction of the catalysts. The remainder of the time was spent on an in situ study of phase changes during heating to 450 o C in CO/H 2 mixtures at higher temperatures and ex situ collection of XAFS/WAXS data on standard reference compounds. XAFS/WAXS study of the Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts Three different Fe-based catalysts; bulk α-Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 /CuO and Fe 2 O 3 /CuO/K 2 O/SiO 2 , were studied under identical conditions. The catalysts were pretreated at 350 o C in a pure H 2 while WAXS and XANES data were recorded continuously. After the pretreatment, EXAFS data was recorded using the quick EXAFS mode. The FT reaction was performed at 250 o C while flowing CO/H 2 . XANES and WAXS data was recorded continuously while the reacting gases and evolving reaction products were monitored using an on-line mass spectrometer. After 4 h FT reaction time, EXAFS data was collected in the quick EXAFS mode.</p><p>During the different stages of the catalyst lifetime (pretreatment, reaction, end of run), significant changes were observed in the XANES and WAXS data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). After pretreatment, the bulk α-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 /CuO catalysts were almost completely reduced to metallic iron, while the Fe 2 O 3 /CuO/K 2 O/SiO 2 sample was only partially reduced. During reaction, metallic iron was quickly converted to a mixture of iron carbides and iron oxide (magnetite). The different catalysts showed subtle differences in the kind of carbides formed, leading to differences in catalytic behavior.</p><p>Overall, the quality of the recorded XAFS and WAXS data was very good and many valuable insights were gained into the catalytic system. It is to be expected that the results will be published in open literature in due time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ study of phase changes during heating in CO/H 2 mixtures</head><p>The same three catalysts that were used in the in situ reaction study: bulk α-Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 /CuO and Fe 2 O 3 /CuO/K 2 O/SiO 2 , were further examined by slowly heating them up to 450 o C in a flow of H 2 /CO gas. Gradual changes were observed in the XANES and WAXS data, as the iron oxide starting material was slowly carburized into a mixture of metallic iron and iron carbides. Some graphite was observed to form at higher temperatures. The data on the distinct carburization behavior of the different catalysts gives valuable information on the system and it is to be expected that these results will be published in due time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>By applying the experience from past beamtimes (26-01-779), the present experiments yielded valuable results and important new insights into the catalytic system. Overall, the user support on the beamline was outstanding once again.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: XANES spectra of the Fe 2 O 3 /CuO catalyst before reaction (black) and after pretreatment (red) and after ~ 4 h of reaction time (green).</figDesc></figure>
