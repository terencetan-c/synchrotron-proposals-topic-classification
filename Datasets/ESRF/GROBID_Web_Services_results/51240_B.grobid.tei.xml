<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Spin-crossover (SCO) is a representative example of molecular bistability, in which the high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) states are interconvertible by physical perturbation such as temperature. 1 Since the first discovery of the SCO phenomenon it has attracted much attention from chemists, biochemists, and physicists, because it offers an understanding of ligand field theory. But despite the tremendous insights that have been gained over the past decades into the underlying electronic principles responsible for the occurrence and the specific behavior of spin transition processes, the study of spin crossover complexes is still a highly attractive research field due to their potential application in developing electronic devices. 2  Especially the molecular mechanisms leading to specific spin cross-over behaviour are still not wellunderstood, since structural (XRD, XAS) and spinstate changes (SQUID, Mößbauer) are measured in two separate of experiments. In a very recent experiment we applied for X-ray emission based methods to study SCO complexes according to scheme 1. We could successfully use HERFD-XAS (high energy resolution fluorescence detected-XAS) and Kβ 1,3 -XES (X-ray emission spectroscopy) to access the total spin by Kβ 1,3 -XES and HERFD-XANES AND the local structure (by Kβ-detected XAS) of iron based spin cross-over compounds in ONE experiment (quasi) simultaneously. The results from analysizing the temperature dependent Kβ 1,3 -XES and HERFD-XANES measurements are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The Kβ 1,3 -XES spectra were analyzed according to the soc-called IADmethod. In this method proposed by Vanko at al., 3 in brief, the difference between the spectrum of a pure spin state and unknown spin states are fomed an integrated, which gives the IAD value that is proportional to either the high or low spin fraction. An example for the spectra obtained with this method is given in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> bottom left. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> to right, the results of this analysis are shown. It is obvious that the spin states do not exactely follow th emagnetization curve. Moreover there is a pronounced effect at around 190 K that can not be easily explained. The according EXAFS spectra shwon in figure 1 bottom right were supposed to give a structural insight in this case. However due to a rather high noise level, it is not possible to distinguish for example the different Fe-N distances present in the complex in dependence of the spin state. Also, the sulfur backscattereres and their distance can only be determined with rather low precision. Valenc to core X-ray emission could give further insights in this case, since Fe-N pairs of different distances will give separated signas in the v2c spectra, ths same is true for the Fe-S pairs. Therefore in the continuation of this project, v2c measurements are planned. Moreover, the presented studies here will be extended to multinuclear sSCO compounds. In these complexes, the low-temperature groudn state is composed of a mixed hs-ls state, which allows to established spin selective XAS spectroscopy. It has to be mentioned here, that during the first experiments, all samples showed highly sufficient stability against radiation damages, and with the cryostat at ID26 a very good temperature resolution could be achieved (0.1 °C).
