<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment we investigated the nature of Asbestos Bodies (AB) in lung tissues of two subjects subjected to prolonged occupational exposure to asbestos. Elemental distribution maps were acquired at 14.4keV on AB deposited on porous membranes after the removal of the organic tissue by digestion with sodium hypochlirite. Bovine liver and SRM1832-1833 from NIST where used as calibrants for accurate elemental quantification.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Elemental quantification indicated that Fe is by far the most concentrated element (about 200x the other elements detected) and it is highly enriched on the AB with respect to the surrounding organic tissue (~20% vs. less than 0.1%, Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The Fe levels found on the AB are twice higher than that measured on the ferritin standard (~11%), but still in line with the Fe concentration reported for ferritin in the literature (10-30%wt, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The average Fe concentration detected in the lung tissue (~0.06%) is of the same order of that measured in the bovine liver standard (~0.02%). Similar amounts of Ca (0.3-0.4%) were detected in AB. Calcium occurring in the AB could arise from CaPO 4 , which could take part in the biomineralization process, as already proposed by Pooley <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. High levels of Cl (~5%), originating from NaCl crystals formed during the digestion procedure and not fully removed by washing the samples with deionized water, were also detected. Copper, Zn, and As in the 0.1-0.8% range were also detected in the AB. The presence of significant amount of Ba found in the AB and, at lower concentration, in the lung tissue, was totally unexpected. Barium was absent in control samples (pristine porous membrane and porous member filtered with pure NaClO), excluding the possibility of external contamination. A representative fluorescence map acquired at 14.4 keV on an AB is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. Only elements that were found in higher concentrations on the AB with respect to the background (cellulose membrane plus residual organic tissue) are shown. The XRF map reveals that the spatial distribution of Fe, Ba, Cu, Zn, and As mimics the morphology of the AB, indicating either that those elements take part in the biomineralization process, or that they are efficiently adsorbed by the AB during its formation. From the figure it can also be seen that elements such as Br and Cl, originating from the original organic tissue or from sodium hypochlorite used to digest the tissue, are uniformly distributed on the background, and are not associated with the AB. The distribution of the above discussed elements was the same in all the AB examined. In particular, Cu, Zn, and Ba appear to be distributed in higher concentrations in the inner part of the AB, were the concentration of Fe is highest. Elemental quantification has rarely been attempted on AB due to the difficulty of isolating a sufficient amount of material. In addition, due to the high dilution level of important trace elements, elemental quantification has always been performed using ICP-MS, which is a bulk technique. Another disadvantage of ICP-MS is that it requires incineration of the organic tissue and the complete dissolution of the AB in strong acids, which can severely alter the chemistry of the samples and destroys any spatial information. Although not sensitive and reliable as ICP-MS, elemental quantification by micro X with little sample pre-treatments, which chemical treatments and retaining spatial information, mineralization process leading to the formation of the determine the quantitative elemental composition of single paper, the results obtained must be considered as a rough estimation.
