<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our lab, we solved the crystal structure of a complex between the Lactococcus lactis FPG protein and a cFapydG-containing DNA but the resolution (2.8Å) was not sufficient to be sure of the damaged base conformation. So, we applied to the ESRF to get some powerful synchrotron beam time.</p><p>During the 3 allocated shifts, 16 crystals were tested and 9 x-ray diffraction datasets were collected. One of these datasets was good enough to solve the structure of our Protein/DNA complex at 1.8Å resolution. This is the first time that the Fapy lesion is observed in a complex with a DNA repair enzyme (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) is a DNA repair enzyme which excises oxidized purines such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and 2,6diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) from damaged DNA. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Fpg protein from Lactococcus lactis (LlFpg) bound to a cFapydG-containing DNA. The structure reveals that Fpg stabilizes the cFapydG nucleoside into an extrahelical conformation inside its substrate binding pocket. In contrast to the recognition of the 8-oxodG lesion which is bound with the glycosidic bond in a syn conformation, the cFapydG lesion displays in the complex an anti conformation. Furthermore, Fpg establishes interactions with all the functional groups of the FapyG base-lesion which can be classified in two categories: (i) those specifying a purine derived lesion (here a guanine), involved in the Watson-Crick face recognition of the lesion and probably contributing to an optimal orientation of the pyrimidine-ring moiety in the binding pocket and (ii) those specifying the imidazole-ring opened moiety of FapyG and probably participating also in the rotameric selection of the FapydG nucleobase. These interactions involve strictly conserved Fpg residues and structural water molecules mediated interactions. The significant differences between the Fpg recognition modes of 8-oxodG and FapydG provide new insights into the Fpg substrate specificity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>structure of the Lactococcus lactis formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase bound to a substrat analogue-containing DNA Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
