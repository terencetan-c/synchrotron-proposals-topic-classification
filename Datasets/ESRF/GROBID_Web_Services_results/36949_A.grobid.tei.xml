<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We report on a small angle scattering experiment of colloidal liquids and glasses using coherent x-rays. The aim of the experiment was to study higher order correlation functions in disordered materials giving access to short and medium range order. Hard sphere and soft sphere colloidal glasses served as prototype disordered material. The particle sizes ranged from 110 to 170 nm. The experiment was performed at the TROIKA beam line ID10 A of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The X-ray energy was 8.03 keV selected by a single bounce Si(111) monochromator. By proper collimation a 10 micron partially coherent x-ray beam was produced. Parasitic scattering from the beam defining slits was removed to a large extent by careful positioning of a guard slit. The scattered radiation was detected at a distance of 2265 mm from the sample by a charge coupled device (Princeton Pi-LCX 1300 CCD) camera with 20 microns pixel size. For the measurement a region of interest of 800 x 800 pixels was selected. A beamstop of size 1mm blocked the direct beam. Series of 1000 CCD images were taken with exposure time varying between 0.15-0.4 seconds and stored on hard disk. Additional 50 dark images were recorded. Including CCD readout time the time interval between consecutive images was 1 second. The dark images were averaged and subtracted from the data. The colloidal form factor F(Q) has been obtained from a diluted colloidal sample. The form factor allowed to deduce the static structure factor S(Q) of the concentrated sample.</p><p>A multi-speckle temporal intensity autocorrelation analysis yielded the dynamic correlation function of the sample. The dynamical correlation function, which relates to the diffusive motion of the colloidal particles, shows no decay within the first 100 seconds. Therefore, we averaged series of 50 to 100 CCD images. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> displays a CCD image measured from a colloidal glass. The CCD image shows a speckle pattern typical of disordered glassy structures with no preferred orientation detectable. Correlations in the sample can now be extracted from such a speckle pattern by applying a novel X-ray cross correlation analysis (XCCA) according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) to the data. For this purpose rings of intensity with constant Q and 1-2 pixel widths have been extracted from the data and an unbiased angular correlation function according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) has been calculated.</p><p>All colloidal samples investigated showed pronounced features in C Q (Δ). As a prominent example the angular correlation function for two PMMA hard sphere systems differing in particle radius are shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. Interestingly, the dominant feature of the angular correlation functions in all hard sphere systems is a strong five-fold modulation. Moreover, time dependent transitions from five-fold to six-fold modulations have been observed in the hard sphere systems. It is interesting to note that the soft sphere systems investigated showed no five-fold modulation but were dominated by six-and four-fold modulations. Our interpretation of the observed modulations is based on the assumption of locally favored structures (LSF) embedded in a disordered matrix. The angular correlation function of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) extracts the local symmetries of the LSF. This interpretation and the appearance of five-fold symmetries is supported by simulations of icosahedral structures embedded in disordered regions.</p><p>In conclusion, our experiment shows that a novel XCCA analysis gives access to local symmetries in disordered matter.
