<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We report preliminary results obtained using µ-XRF and µ-XANES analyses, performed at the ID21 beamline, on Fe-oxides and -oxyhydroxides bearing samples formed by polymetallic sulphides alteration during AMD (Acid Mine Drainage) processes at the Libiola Mine (Sestri Levante, Genova, Italy). The samples were the same used for a previous experiment (CH-2095, ID18F) that allowed to determine the mineralogy (by µ-XRD) and the elemental concentration (by µ-XRF; for elements with Z&gt;26) along several transects containing the transition from unaltered sulphides to completely altered Fe-oxides andoxyhydroxides layers During the experiment EC-156 we focused the attention on three different samples: a) the first sample is characterized by a well defined transition from an unalterd massive mineralization (pyrite ± chalcopyrite ± sphalerite) to the surrounding oxidation products (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>); b) the second sample is a weakly altered stockwork mineralization (pyrite ± chalcopyrite) consisting of a complex network of sulphide veins surrounded by a silicate matrix (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>); c) the third sample is a stratified hardpan consisting of rhythmic alternation of submillimetric hematite-rich and goethite-rich layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). On the three samples we performed micro-XANES and micro-XRF maps along selected transects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>); the maps were carried out in areas of 100 x 100 µm with a resolution of 1 x 1 µm. The sulphur oxidation state were determined by scannin the energy of the exciting beam across the sulphur absorption K-edge (Total S = 2.55 KeV; sulphide = 2.472 KeV; sulphate = 2.482 KeV). The exciting energy for micro-XRF maps and profiles was set to maximixe the fluorescence yeld of the elements with 13 ≤ Z &lt; 26.</p><p>a b c</p><p>XANES maps have been performed to follow the steps of pyrite alteration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>-3) Preliminary results evidenced that the first step is marked by sulphur oxidation to sulphate. This oxidation process starts from the crystals rims or from intragrain microfractures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) Sulphate is then rapidly leak out from the system and few µm whitin the outer altered layers is almost completely absent.  The altered layers, composed almost exclusively by Fe-oxides (hematite) and -oxyhydroxides (goethite, ferrihydrite, lepidocrocite), concentrically rim crystals, and fill intra-and inter-grain interstices. Elemental maps and µ-XRF transects confirmed the high affinity of the secondary minerals to adsorb or incorporate many of the elements leached from sulphides or from gangue minerals, and thus their very important role on the control of the mobility of trace contaminants. In particular, we constantly observed significant enrichment in Cr in the hematite and goehite rich layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>-5) as well as good positive correlations between Fe and Al, Mn, Ti, and V. Moreover, µ-XRF maps confirm the strong depletion of sulphur in the Feoxides and -oxyhydroxides. Further studies are in progress to complete the data set interpretation and to combine the present results with those of experiment CH-2095. Moreover, S and Fe K-edge XANES data, collected on selected regions, will be analyzed to get more accurate information on the S and Fe oxidation states and local structure in these regions.
