<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Gas hydrates are non-stoichiometric inclusion compounds in which small molecules are encaged into a host framework of water molecules. For the most common structures (called type I and type II, both of them cubic) two types of water cages exist, usually referred to as small and large cages. The cage-fillings can be predicted with a statistical thermodynamic theory established by van-der-Waals &amp; Platteeuw in 1959 and refined further over the years. A critical test for the predictive power of the various existing approaches is the comparison with experimental data of the cage fillings of gas hydrates produced at various conditions of pressue (gas fugacity) and temperature. Diffraction is the only general method to access the cage occupancies of small and large cages individually and on an absolute scale. The purpose of this proposal was to check existing predictions of cage fillings with the experimental numbers established by synchrotron powder diffraction on ID31. Synchrotron powder diffraction appeared as the most promising tool as it allows for disentangling the parameter correlations between cage occupancies and atomic displacement parameters by measuring up to high scattering angles. 24 samples were prepared in Göttingen, filled into quartz capillaries and mounted onto a magnetic sample holder ready to go onto the rotation stage of ID31. The samples were transported in a dry Moover dewar and transported by car to Grenoble. The cryo-stream cooler was set to low temperature and the samples quickly transferred to the sample stage. The wavelength was set to 0.403027Å (calibrated with a NIST Si standard). Data collection typically proceeded up to a 2Θ angle of 65° (in some cases 100°) in steps of 0.005°. The amount of sample in the capillary varied slightly along the capillary (NB: It should be noted that the filling of the capillaries under liquid nitrogen conditions was not a minor job). Thus -before setting the scans for various positions along the capillary -the most promising parts were identified by short pre-scans. Data collection then proceeded with a typical speed of 2°/ min for usually 3 to 5, exceptionally up to 15 positions. The capillary spinning during data collection was set to 2000-3000 rpm. For the following Rietveld analysis the data of the different scans for one sample were averaged. The results of the Rietveld refinements using GSAS are shown in Tab.1; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows two typical diffraction patterns and the Rietveld fit.. In the table the formation conditions of the gas hydrate, the weighted profile R-factor, the cubic lattice constant a as well as the so-called hydration number (which reflects the overall gas composition) is given for all studied samples.</p><p>Table 1 Results of th Rietveld refinements gas hydrate T Syn.

The results are of sufficient quality to check thermodynamic prediction programs. However, various problems occurred on the way and slowed down the data analysis. Firstly, the quartz capillaries contributed a very pronounced background which had to be subtracted manually; All other analytical methods implemented into GSAS for describing the background were unsatisfactory. Secondly, some of the (competing) structural models available in literature were not compatibel with the diffraction data, in particular for the molecular disorder of CO 2 in CO 2 -hydrate. This has been resolved now thanks to the data from ID31. Lastly, the nominal temperature of 90 to 100K for the sample position in the cryo-stream was found to be incorrect;after tedious cross calibrations with the lattice constants of ice Ih (our own HASYLAB synchrotron data) and those of CO 2 hydrate (neutron HRPD time-of-flight data from literature) we find temperatures at the sample position in the range of 115-145 K. Thus the actual sample temperatures are bound with some uncertainity without a proper calibration; the ice ih calibration could not reliably be applied to all samples as some had very little ice. Yet, the structural results of this experiment are certainly worth publishing and this is in progress now. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 (top) Rietveld refinement result for deuterated CH4-hydrate formed at 150bar and 271.15K; (bottom) dito for H 2 O-N 2 -hydrate formed at 200bar and 271.15K.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,34.02,281.82,527.41,244.98" type="bitmap" /></figure>
