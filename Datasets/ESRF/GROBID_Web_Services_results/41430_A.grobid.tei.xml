<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Diffractive-refractive optics: X-ray collimator The goal of the experiment was to verify a low aberration focusing Bragg device. The focusing was based on a diffractive-refractive effect. Crystals in previous experiments had a circular hole which is an approximation of the ideal parabolic groove. This lead to high abberations which enlarged the focal spot size. Device in the current experiment consisted of two Si(111) bulk crystals with two opposing precise parabolic grooves, fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Both crystals had an asymmetry of 15°. The used energy was 7.31 keV, which equals to a Bragg angle of 15.7°. With an asymmetry of 15°, the incident angle was just 0.7°.</p><p>These crystals were used in a dispersive arrangement, i.e. with 4 diffraction events. Because of the low incident angle, the geometry was very surface sensitive. Thanks to precisely prepared parabolic groove shape, all the aberrations introduced by the shape of the optics were reduced to minimum. The only aberrations were due to the geometrical arrangement of the crystals (can not be principally removed) and partially to the surface quality.</p><p>Analytically calculated focusing distance was 1.1 m. The crystals were placed 34 m from the source, which represents a de-magnefication of 22. The dimension of the source was 270 µm, so the theoretical focal spot size should be 10.8 µm.</p><p>Ray-tracing simulations were used, based on the Monte-Carlo approach, to simulate the focal spot shape and verify the focusing distance. The simulated focusing distance was 1.08 m, which was in agreement with the analytical calculations. The detected and measured focal distance was at 1.4 m, with a focal spot size of 38 µm, fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The discrepancy in ray-tracing simulated and measured focal size was due to the surface quality of the parabolic groove. Even after mechano -chemicall polishing there are still some artefacts on the surface after the drilling tools. We were not able to polish the parabolic surface as good as a flat Si surface.</p><p>This experiment demonstrated to the first time a low aberration focusing by precise parabolic groove and reached the smallest focal spot with this kind of crystal optics.</p><p>Fig.1 Fig.2</p><p>.Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Peter Oberta* Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Martin Kittler* Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Petr Mikulík* Institute of Condensed Matter Physics, Brno, Czech Republic Report:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>The focusing distance for 1.4 m corresponds to a Bragg angle of 15.875°, what is a mismatch of 0.165° to the calculated angle of 15.7°. The dependence of the focusing distance on the Bragg angle becomes very steep in the range of 15°-20°, fig.3, and even small changes in angle are responsible for a substancial change in the focusing distance. A change of angle by 0.165° can lead to a prolongation of the focusing distance by the measured 0.3 m.</figDesc></figure>
