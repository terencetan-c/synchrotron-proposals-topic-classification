<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To complete aim 1, we collected and analysed complete sets of SAXS data for both the V. cholerae and E. coli Hfq. This has provided us with the first structural information for the full-length proteins (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The SAXS data show that the full-length proteins are hexameric. This is in agreement with our previous size exclusion chromatography and non-dissociating nanoflow mass spectrometry studies. The V. cholerae Hfq has an R g of 31.1 Å and a D max of 105 Å. In contrast, Preliminary SAXS data for four of the eight E. coli and V. cholerae sRNAs has been collected, allowing initial progress within aim 2 of our study to be achieved. Specifically, E. coli sRNA DsrA and V. cholerae sRNAs Qrr1, Qrr2 and Qrr3 were tested. In each case, the data suggests the sRNAs to be monomeric. An example of the data collected for sRNA DsrA is shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>  Preliminary SAXS data for only one sRNA-Hfq complex was collected in the beamtime available. Consequently, only minimal initial progress within aim 3 of our study has been made. The set of data collected was for a 1:1 complex of V. cholerae sRNA Qrr1 bound to Hfq. Analysis indicates the complex to have an R g of 71 Å and D max of 305 Å. Ab initio modelling has been undertaken and suggests it to have a structure capable of encompassing one Hfq hexamer and one sRNA monomer, as shown in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. This is in agreement with our data on complex formation stoichiometries obtained using size exclusion chromatography, non-dissociating mass spectrometry and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This preliminary data not only presents the first data for a solution structure of an RNA-Hfq complex, it also provides a sound bases for undertaking further sRNA-Hfq complex analysis in order to complete aim 3.

This difference in size between the two proteins can most likely be attributed to the extended C-terminus of the E. coli protein compared to the shorter V. cholerae C-terminal tail (Fig 2). Ab initio modelling of our SAXS data with DAMMIF 1 indicates that both Hfq proteins have a central compact core region with six protruding 'arms' (Fig1). The crystal structure of the Nterminal 72 amino acids of the E. coli protein, corresponding to ~2/3 of the full-length protein 2 , fits well within the compact core of both models (Fig1). This is expected based on the 96% sequence identity between this region in the E. coli and V. cholerae proteins (Fig2). The length of the protruding 'arms' appears to be longer for the E. coli Hfq. Again, this can be attributed to the longer C-terminal region in the E. coli protein (Fig2).</figDesc></figure>

Ab initio modelling of our SAXS data for DsrA indicates the sRNA to form an extended structure. Similarly, data collected for sRNA Qrr1 (figure 3, right panel) identified it to have an R g of 49 Å and D max of 220 Å and ab initio modelling indicated it to have an extended structure also. These represent the first solution structures of sRNAs to our knowledge.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The data collected are providing the first solution structure information on Hfq, sRNAs and the complexes they form. Whilst this experiment only allowed for completion of aim 1, the initial steps taken in analysing the sRNAs alone and in complex with Hfq (aims 2 and 3) are significant. The sRNAs and sRNA-Hfq complexes can be more challenging to prepare and demonstration of the suitability of these samples for SAXS analysis is important in guiding future sample preparations for SAXS and SANS analysis. With this knowledge in hand, and confidence in our ability to prepare samples of appropriate quality and analyse successfully the data obtained, we hope that future SAXS and SANS experiments will allow this work to be completed in full.</p></div>			</div>
