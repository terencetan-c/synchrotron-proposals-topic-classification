In the frame of a PhD thesis made in collaboration with IRSN, we have focused our attention on the study of molybdenum behaviour in uranium dioxide (either stoichiometric UO2 or hyperstoichiometric UO2,1), under extreme temperature and irradiation conditions. The initial aim of this experiment was to characterize the chemical state and environment of Mo implanted in uranium dioxide pellets after different annealing and irradiation treatments, by XANES and EXAFS measurements at the Mo K edge. However, it was not possible to detect a Mo fluorescene signal at this edge. This is due to the very low Mo concentration in the samples and the high fluorescence signal due to the uranium matrix. Therefore, we have made measurements at the uranium L3 edge with the aim to detect structural changes in the UO2 matrix caused by heavy ions irradiation and oxidation. 25 samples (UO2 sintered pellets) were analysed by EXAFS. Data treatment is underway, so here are presented the first observations made.</p><p>The first kind of samples that were analysed are polycristalline UO2 pellets irradiated at high temperature (between 600 and 1000°C) with high energy heavy ions. Different irradiation conditions were chosen in order to favour either the formation of electronic defects or balistic defects in the UO2 bulk. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> displays the comparision between Fourier Transforms spectra obtained from the EXAFS of a virgin UO2 with 2 UO2 irradiated at 800°C, with high enery heavy ions favouring either the production of ballistic defects (Au irradiation) or the simultaneous formation of ballistic and electronic defets (Au+W). The main peaks visible on the TF correspond to the successive shells of oxygen and uranium atoms arising from the known fluoritetype structure of UO2. It is interesting to note that the sole ballistic defects created at 800°C do not imply any visible change in the UO2 local structure. It may be related to a temperature activated restructuration of UO2 microstucture. At the same time, we observe a noticeable change in the TF between UO2 and Au+W samples on the 5.5 Å peak. It corresponds to an uranium shell located at 5.45 Å.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: comparision of FT spectra for 3 UO2 samples, as a function of irradiation conditions</p><p>The second example shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> concerns the evolution of UO2 microstructure under oxidation. We show here FT spectra for 3 hyperstoichiometric UO2 samples, UO2+x with x = 2.03, 2.15 and 2.21. For the latter, XRD characterization has shown the presence of some U4O9 phase in the sample.</p><p>As compared to stoichiometric UO2, we observe the apparition of a contribution at short distance (peak below 2 Å) for the higher stoichiometry. This peak was observed by others authors and attributed to the presence of U(VI). Indeed, this species exibits 2 axial oxygens at short interatomic distance that could fit with this contribution. However, this hypothesis is still discussed in the community as it would imply that the U4O9 oxide contain not only U(+IV) and U(+V) as commonly admitted, but also U(+VI). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: FT spectra of UO2+x samples with x = 2.03, 2.15 and 2.21.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,157.20,469.80,280.90,167.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
