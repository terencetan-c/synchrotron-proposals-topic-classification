<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report :</head><p>Recently it has become clear that in crystal growth from solution the interfacial region plays a much more important role than originally thought <ref type="bibr">[I]</ref>. Both the liquid and the solid part of the interface are important, but as a first step we want to study the crystal structure. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, KHsPO,) has a high crystal quality (no mosaic spread) and is a very interesting crystal both from a technological and a fundamental point of view. It is for example used as a frequency doubler and optical switch in laser applications. Theoretical studies correctly predict that the pyramid faces (101) and the prism faces {loo} are flat in solution, but for the (101) faces there are two possible terminations, either with PO:-or K+ ions. Knowing the detailed interface structure would help in understanding why impurities like Fe3+ and Cr3+ strongly reduce the growth velocity on the prism faces and have a much smaller effect on the pyramid faces [2].</p><p>We have studied the surface structure of both faces in situ using surface X-ray diffraction. The crystals were mounted in a growth chamber made of polycarbonate (LEXAN), consisting of an outer heating bath kept at a constant temperature by a thermostat. In the inner chamber the crystal is mounted in an environment of saturated KDP-solution. The incoming and outgoing X-rays penetrate through a thin mylar foil (6 pm) which can be pushed close to the crystal, leaving a thin layer of solution between the crystal and the foil (thickness N 10 pm).</p><p>On both the ( <ref type="formula">101</ref>) and (100) surface we have measured the intensity along so-called crystal truncation rods (CTR's). These CTR's are tails of diffuse intensity connecting the bulk Bragg peaks in the direction perpendicular to the surface and show the interference between bulk and surface structure. The crystals are sufficiently flat to measure the CTR intensity far from the Bragg peaks, where the surface sensitivity is highest. For the X-ray wavelength used (0.73 A), there is a lot of background scattering from the crystal, but for larger wavelengths the attenuation in the solution becomes too high.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows structure factor amplitudes along the (hk) = (10) CTR measured on KDP(101) 131. The dashed curve is a calculation for a bulk K-terminated surface and the dotted curve a calculation for a surface terminating with Pod. It is immediately clear that the surface is K-terminated. Allowing small relaxations of the top layer results in the solid line (which is a fit for the complete data set including the (11) and (2 1) CTR's). The structure determination was done at a temperature of 22 "C. While cooling to 21 "C, which corresponds to a supersaturation o = 2%, we monitored the (2 10.7) reflection. On growing the peak significantly sharpened which means the surface quality gets better. Heating up again (dissolution) causes a broadening of the peak shape.</p><p>On the (100) face also different CTR's were measured besides the specular reflectivity. From the CTR's we can conclude that this surface structure is simply bulk terminated. Further analysis of the data is currently in progress.</p><p>[l] X.Y. Liu, ES. Boek, W.J. Briels, and P.
