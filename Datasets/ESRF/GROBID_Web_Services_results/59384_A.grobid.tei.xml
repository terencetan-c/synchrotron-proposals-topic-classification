<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Uranium dioxide has a key limitation as a reactor fuel; the thermal conductivity is compromised upon increased irradiation damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As the thermal conductivity falls, it is necessary to increase the reactor operating temperature in order to maintain a constant power output. This, combined with the degradation of structural integrity as a function of damage, are the key factors that limit the fuel lifetime. The predominant mechanism responsible for heat transfer in nuclear fuel is the phonons. It is therefore critical that we understand this mechanism, and how it is compromised as a function of irradiation damage. To investigate this, we proposed to measure the phonon dispersion curves and line widths of an irradiated and as-grown epitaxial thin film of UO2, by grazing-incidence Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS) on ID28. Measurement of these line widths can be directly related to the anharmonicity, and thus provide information on the contribution of each phonon branch to the thermal conductivity.</p><p>The experimental data presented here are a result of a continuation experiment conducted on this subject. The initial measurements taken in July 2015 (HC-1699) were successful in obtaining phonon measurements in UO2 thin films, however the measured phonons were weak, particularly at the zone boundaries. This was a result of a range of experimental limitations. With an incident angle of 0.2 o the majority of x-rays were being reflected from the surface, as the critical angle of UO2 at 17.9 keV is ~ 0.3º in two theta thus it is unsurprising that the phonons were exceedingly weak. This low incident angle also allowed for only 14 nm of the film depth to be probed and thus measurements are sensitive to surface defects. Additional experimental limitations included: non-uniformly damaged films and restricted access to phonon zones as a result of the sample mount, both of which also contributed to obtaining limited experimental data. Despite this, the initial measurements were promising and we were granted further experimental time in July 2016 (HC-2508). In this experiment significant improvements were made. Firstly, uniform damage profiles were achieved through raster scanning the ion beam across the film surface. Secondly, the sample mount was developed such that a wider range of reciprocal space directions could be accessed. However perhaps the most significant improvement was in the development of the experimental technique used to measure phonons in thin films. While restricted to an incident angle of 0.2⁰, an additional tilt of 1⁰ was added such that we moved away from the critical angle of UO2. This allowed for distinct improvements in the phonon measurements, and resulted in a full exploration of the (220) and (400) positions along the transverse and longitudinal directions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results</head><p>Prior to the experiment, single crystal UO2 [001], 0.5 µm thin films were grown on SrTiO3 [001] at the University of Bristol via DC magnetron sputtering. Part of the film was kept to represent a pristine sample. To induce the damage, irradiation experiments were conducted at the Dalton Cumbia Facility, UK using 2.1 MeV He 2+ ions. The ion beam was raster scanned across the sample to achieve a uniform damage profile with an average number of displacements per atom (dpa) of 0.15. In agreement with the previous IXS experiment, this level of damage was selected as it produced an observable shift in the UO2 XRD Bragg peaks providing confidence that a change had occurred within the lattice.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, shows a comparison of the data acquired during the first and second experimental run. There is an increase in the signal/noise ratio between these two efforts. In addition the time taken to measure a phonon was also much shorter, so that the overall improvement between 2015 and 2016 was on average ten fold. However this improvement was increasingly more significant for the measurements observed at larger q values. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for q = 0.8 it was not possible to observe a phonon in this position in July 2015, however a strong phonon signal was observed in 2016.</p><p>It is clear that the developments made in sample preparation and experimental technique have led to marked improvements in observing phonons in UO2 thin films. However, unfortunately, the result of this improvement showed that the acoustic phonons are not measurably altered by 0.15 dpa of damage with 2.1 MeV He 2+ ions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), despite the alteraction of the lattice parameter of the films, as observed with XRD.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the experimental data obtained here, compared with that collected by Pang et. al. for bulk UO2 measured via inelastic neutron scattering (INS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. As shown, the observed phonon energies are in agreement with existing neutron data, however no clear trend can be depicted between the damaged and pristine measurements. We therefore believe that a greater level of damage is required to alter the phonon dispersion of UO2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The transverse and longitudinal accoustic phonons were measured for both a pristine and damaged UO2 thin film along the (00ξ) and (ξξ0) directions via inelastic x-ray scattering at beamline ID28, ESRF. These measurements were a continuation of a previous experimental run (HC-1699), upon which significant advances have been made to develop a technique which allows for successful exploration of the phonon dispersion of thin film samples. Unfortunately the result of this improved experimental technique showed that the acoustic phonons are not measurably altered by 0.15 dpa of damage with 2.1 MeV He 2+ ions, despite the alteraction of the lattice parameter of the films, as observed with XRD.</p><p>In spite of this, alterations in the phonon dspersion is predicted by point defect calculations currently being carried out by our colaborators B. Dorado et al. of the CEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>, which are the first phonon calculations for damaged UO2. Therefore while 0.15 dpa of damage with 2.1 MeV He 2+ ions was not sufficient to induce such a change, we are hopeful that extended irradiation with a heavier ion such as Xe would stimulate a stronger damage response, measurable in the phonon dispersion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A comparisong of the transverse accoustic phonons measured from the (220) position for q values 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 from experimental runs conducted in July 2015 (red) and July 2016 (blue).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,293.70,9.50,298.50,246.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
