<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our experiment "X-ray phase contrast and fluorescence analysis of heavy metals in bacterial biofilms" we investigated the morphology of bacteria and the distribution of different chemical elements inside these organisms. Soil samples were collected from Inner Mongolia and the natural bacterial population was isolated, purified via separation of soil particles and grown in artificial DEV media containing 378 µg/L Arsenic (AsV). A taxonomic profile was acquired with DNA-based PCR-DGGE fingerprint technique revealing the following composition of the natural population: Pseudomonas stutzeri strain LC2-8, Pseudomonas sp. CO-44, Saltmarsh clone SCP-79, Filobacillus sp. MO21, Sanguibacter marinus, Cellulosimicrobium sp., Stenotrophomonas sp. J54C16 As a control sample, a lab strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultivated under high nutrient conditions in DEV medium without the presence of additional Arsenic. Both types of samples were fixed and embedded in epoxy. As previous measurements had shown that heavy metals (Uranium, Osmium) conventionally used as stains in embedding protocols for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) severely influence the X-ray fluorescence signal, an embedding protocol omitting these staining steps was chosen (unpublished). The embedded bacteria were cut in thin sections for further investigation. For the pre-characterization with TEM, a thickness of 50 nm was chosen, whereas for the investigation with X-rays, slices were cut to 1 µm, 2 µm and 5 µm. TEM images (compare fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) confirmed successful sample preparation and revealed -as expected -a wide distribution of size and shape within the natural bacteria population. In total, 10 different samples were prepared. Furthermore, all samples were pre-characterized by optical microscopy (compare fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) in order to facilitate sample alignment during the experiment.</p><p>During the beam time at ID22NI, first, the structure of the samples was investigated in 2D by X-ray propagation based phase contrast nano-imaging, then 2D X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis at chosen areas was done to correlatively determine the distribution of heavy metals within the sample. On each of the 4 measured samples 6 to 8 areas were chosen to acquire sufficient statistics. Also, a standard sample was measured for calibration of the XRF spectra in order to get quantitative results. For those measurements, 8 shifts were used. The remaining 7 shifts were used for 3D tomographic measurements of the 5 µm thick samples. Both, holotomography as well as XRF tomographic scans were taken of 4 samples, again several areas on each sample were scanned. Due to the excellent beam conditions and setup at the beamline and the dedicated support of the local contact, the beam could be focused to a spot size of 65 nm (hor) x 60 nm (vert), which allowed XRF imaging with extremely high resolution as it is only possible at very few synchrotrons. The possibility to pre-align the sample by means of a built-in optical microscope objective at the experimental station of ID22NI combined with thorough pre-characterization of the samples severely facilitated sample alignment and thus significantly contributed to an efficient use of beam time.</p><p>First results (compare fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) look very promising, as individual bacteria can be distinguished in the XRF maps and it is obvious that the different elements are not homogeneously distributed among different bacteria. In future experiments, we plan to isolate different bacterial strains from the natural population in order to find out, which ones contribute to the processing of Arsenic. Combined with additional micro-and molecular-biological techniques, we thus want to shed more light on the possible pathways of drinking water pollution with heavy metals.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Forschungszentrum</head><figDesc>Karlsruhe GmbH-KIT GmbH Institute for Synchrotron Radiation -ANKA Postfach 3640 76021 KARLSRUHE GERMANY XU Feng* Laboratory ANKA Angstroemquelle GmbH Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344 KARLSRUHE GERMANY PhD SUHONEN Heikki* Laboratory ESRF 6 rue Jules Horowitz B.P 220 38043 GRENOBLE Cedex FRANCE Dr. HELFEN Lukas* Laboratory Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe Institut fuer Synchrotronstrahlung -ISS Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344 KARLSRUHE GERMANY Dr. ROSENHAHN Axel Laboratory Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Institute of Functional Interfaces (IFG) Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344 KARLSRUHE GERMANY Dr. SCHWARTZ Thomas Laboratory Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Institute of Functional Interfaces (IFG) Microbiology of Natural and Technical Interfaces Department Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen 76344 KARLSRUHE GERMANY</figDesc></figure>
