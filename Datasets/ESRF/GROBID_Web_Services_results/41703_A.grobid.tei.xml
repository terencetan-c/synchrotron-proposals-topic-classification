<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules is an extremely important process in nature responsible for a wide range of structures including the living cell itself. Here scattering techniques play a vital roleespecially synchrotron SAXS combined with a stopped-flow set-up which due to the high brilliance of the beam and the rapid mixing can directly access the structural evolution in the milli-second range and hence the kinetics. The aim of this proposal was twofold. First the intention was to investigate the formation (micellization) kinetics of low-molecular weight surfactant micelles. The idea was to compare the results to the data previously obtained from block copolymer micelles <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In the second part we aimed to study the early stage of a cylinder-sphere transition ocurring in a system of amphiphilic block copolymer micelles. In the preparation for the ESRF experiement, several surfactant solvent systems were investigated as candidates to study the micellization kinetics. The best contrast conditions were found for C12G2 sugar surfactants in water/dimethylformamide (DMF) mixtures where the head groups (sugar rings) show a strong positve contrast to DMF/water solutions while that of the C12 tail is negative. In addition, micellization could be easily triggered by adding water into surfactant/DMF solutions at concentrations above 7.5 mg/mL. At ID02 we performed systematic experiments of the micellization process of these surfactants using a stopped-flow apparatus. Some respresentative data, at 10 mg/mL 1:1 DMF/water solution, are given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> where the scattered intensity vs. Q is plotted as a function time.</p><p>As seen in the Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> a), we can observe the complete transition from unimers at short times to a gradual emergence of micelles at longer times. Thus, for the first time the complete micellization process of surfactant micelles has been observed thanks to the high flux offered in synchrotron SAXS. In order to model the scattering, we considered a general coexistence approach consisting of a linear combination of surfactant (modelled as a linear inhomogenous "pearl necklace") and an elipsoidal core-shell model. As seen in Fig 1 <ref type="figure">b</ref>), the model works rather well giving the fraction of micelles and the mean radius of micelles as depeicted in c) and d) respectively. In the near future we plan to compare the structural results to a detailed kinetic model.</p><p>In the other part of the experiment we focussed on the transition from cylindrical to spherical micelles in amphiphilic poly(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEP-PEO) micelles induced by addition of DMF to a water rich solution. The results shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> a) are rather difficult to interpret due to the near contrast match between the overall micelle and solvent for SAXS which impede a complete resolution of the the morphology. Nevertheless, the experiment was also repeated with SANS (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2 b</ref>) and progress is being made to systematically compare the data. In particular by the complimentary contrast for xrays and neutrons, we may obtain detailed information concerning the internal micellar structure during the course of the kinetic process using SAXS, while SANS detects the overall morphology. 0.01 0.1 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 0 ms 100 ms 202.5 ms 310.1 ms 423.1 ms 541.8 ms 1230.2 ms 3230.2 ms 6488.1 ms 34518.9 ms 171822.1 ms dΣ/dΩ(Q)/φ [cm -1 ] Q [Å -1 ] Figure 2: The cylinder to sphere transition of PEP1-PEO1 micelles in DMF/water solutions. a) shows the kinetic data obtained using x-rays at ID02 while b), represents data measured using neutrons at D11, ILL. 0.01 0.1 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 2.6 ms 205.1 ms 709.6 ms 6870.38 ms 31855.28ms 132933.10 ms 542064.4 ms dΣ/dΩ(Q)/φ [cm -1 ] Q [Å -1 ] a) 0.1 1 10 100 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 c surfactant 7.5 mg/mL 10 mg/mL 15 mg/mL fraction of surfactants in micelles t (s) c)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Micllization kinetics of C12G2 beta-dodecyl maltoside surfacrtants. a) shows the time resolved scattering data obtained at ID02. b) representative fits conisting of a coexistence model between ellipsoidal micelles and linear surfactants.c) extracted normalized fraction of micelles as a function of time d) time dependent micellar core radii b i d f h fi</figDesc></figure>
