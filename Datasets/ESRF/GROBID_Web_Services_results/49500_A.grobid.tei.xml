<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Technical and Scientific Milestones Achieved (in relation to the milestones identified in the original proposal):</head><p>Year 1</p><p>We are reporting the results of one 15 shift experiment that took place from December 5 to 10, 2012. There has therefore been very limited time for detailed analysis of the results. The scientific and technical achievements of this LTP experiment are as follows:</p><p>1-Acute lung injury: effect of mechanical ventilation modes and surfactant replacement therapy on regional lung function (Scientific goal #4). For practical reasons we scheduled the study of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), initially planned for year 3. The goal of this study was to compare 2 modes of mechanical ventilation: pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) and volume control (VC) and how they determine the mechanical behaviour of small peripheral bronchi and alveoli, in lavage-induced acute lung injury in rabbit. We subsequently assessed the effect of surfactant replacement therapy, a treatment of infant respiratory distress syndrome. These goals are significant because currently there is very little data on how mechanical ventilation settings or surfactant administration affect regional lung function in normal or diseased lungs. We used a natural bovine lung extract containing phospholipids, neutral lipids, fatty acids, and surfactant-associated proteins (Survanta®, provided by Abott laboratories). Analysis of the results is still proceeding. A full set of data were obtained in 8 rabbits and the effect of surfactant instillation alone was assessed in 2 healthy controls. An example of regional ventilation images in the different experimental conditions in a representative animal is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Alongside KES imaging, respiratory mechanical parameters were measured using the forced oscillation technique. As an example, preliminary results showing the changes in respiratory tissue elastance (H, cmH 2 O/ml) are shown in Figure 2.

Respiratory tissue elastance measured by forced oscillation technique under the different experimental conditions. *: p&lt;0.05 (one-way repeated measure ANOVA).</p><p>2-Dosimetry study of in vivo K-edge subtraction imaging (Technical goal #2). This goal is significant because for possible clinical application of KES, radiation dose needs to be minimized while maintaining an optimal image quality. We performed KES-CT imaging in vivo in an anesthetized and ventilated New Zealand rabbit with low (20%) inhaled xenon gas in O 2 .</p><p>The radiation dose, defined as kerma length product (PKL), was measured free-in-air with a cylindrical ionization chamber. As a parameter of image quality, contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was calculated in different doses (PKL: 0.2-505.1 mGy•cm) from the subtracted xenon images.</p><p>The following figure shows the dependency of CNR as a function of PKL. Rose criterion (CNR&gt;5), which was used to define an adequate CNR value, is shown as a dashed line. As a conclusion KES-CT method can be potentially used in clinical functional lung imaging considering rather high image quality compared to the delivered radiation dose. Experiments are completed, and data-analysis is currently on-going.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-Imaging of phantoms carrying combinations of Iodine and xenon at known concentrations for validation of theoretical studies (Scientific Goal #2).</head><p>A phantom containing dissolved xenon and iodine in a neutral medium was designed and tested. Phantoms with varying concentrations of up to 1.5 mg/ml iodine and 7 g/ml xenon were imaged at energies bracketing both iodine and xenon k-edge. These data will be useful for validating theoretical studies aiming at simultaneous quantification of both contrast agents.</p><p>In </p></div>
