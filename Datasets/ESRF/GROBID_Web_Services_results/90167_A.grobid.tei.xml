<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>The rich elemental composition, surface chemistry, and outstanding electrical conductivity of MXenes make them a promising class of two-dimensional (2D) materials for electrochemical energy storage. To translate these properties into high performance devices, it is essential to develop fabrication strategies that allow MXenes to be assembled into electrodes with tunable architectures and investigate the effect of their pore structure on the capacitive performance. Here, we report on the fabrication of MXene aerogels with highly ordered lamellar structures by unidirectional freeze-casting of additive-free Ti3C2Tx aqueous suspensions. These structures can be subsequently processed into practical supercapacitor electrode films by pressing or calendering steps. This versatile processing route allows a wide control of film thickness, spacing within lamellae (to give electrolyte accessible sites), and densities (over 2 orders of magnitude) and hence gives control over the final properties. The as-prepared MXene aerogel with a density of 13 mg cm-3 achieves 380 F g-1 capacitance at 2 mV s-1 and 75 F g-1 at 50 mV s-1. The calendering of the MXene aerogel into a porous 60 μm thick film with a density of 434 mg cm-3 leads to a superior rate capability of 309 F g-1 at 50 mV s-1. In addition, the rolled electrodes present an improvement in volumetric capacitance of 104 times as compared to the as-prepared MXene aerogel. Finally, the outstanding cyclability of rolled electrodes strengthens their nomination for supercapacitor applications. In this paper we demonstrate the possibilities in tuning the porosity and the electrochemical properties of aerogels highlighting the importance of evaluating new and hybrid processing methods to develop energy storage applications. The simplicity and versatility of the developed fabrication strategy open opportunities for the utilization of MXene lamellae architectures in a wide range of applications requiring controlled porosity including catalysis, filtration, and water purification.</p></div>

Tailoring lamellar MXene aerogel microstructure using compression. Intended Journal: ACS Nano Intended submission: March 2021 Abstract: Compression allows the nano-and micro-structure of lamellar freeze cast aerogel to be tailored towards specific applications such as energy storage or advanced composites, where a 3D nanostructure of closely spaced, aligned sheets is desired. Characterising aerogel structural evolution during compression is needed to allow optimisation of manufacturing, understand in-service structural changes, and determine how aerogel micro-and nano-structure relates to functional properties. Herein we have developed methods to quantitatively analyse lamellar aerogel domains, sheet spacing and sheet orientation in 3D and their evolution as a function of increasing compression through synchrotron phase contrast X-ray micro computed tomography (µCT). The as-cast domains are predominantly aligned with the freezing (Y) direction with random orientation in the orthogonal (XZ) plane. Sheet spacing was uniform (standard deviation less than a third of the sheet spacing) throughout the aerogel, with the exception of the sample edge which exhibited greater sheet spacing and was aligned perpendicular to the edge. Generally the sheets rotated towards flat and their spacing narrowed progressively with compression with negligible lateral strain (zero Poisson's ratio). This is with the exception of sheets close to parallel with the loading direction (Z), which maintained their orientation and sheet spacing until ~60% compression, beyond which they exhibited buckling. These data suggest that a single-domain, fully aligned as-cast aerogel is not necessary to produce a post-compression aligned lamellar structure and indicate how the spacing can be tailored as a function of compressive strain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
