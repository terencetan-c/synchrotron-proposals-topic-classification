<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The long term project on high energy angle resolved photoemission (HARPES) that was approved by the beam time review committee in 2000 was the continuation of in-house work that was conducted at ID12B from the fall of 1997 and onwards. The aim of the project was to develop an experimental setup capable of performing angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the 400-1000 eV range with sufficient angular and energy resolution to study valence band dispersion. This requires very high photon flux because of the low cross-sections, angular resolution on the order of 0.1 o and an energy resolution on the order of 100 meV. The main interests for going to high photon energies are increased bulk sensitivity, a free electron like photoelectron decoupled from the rest of the system and an approximately linear relation between electron momentum and emission angle. These properties make HARPES an excellent experimental tool in the study of strongly correlated 3D system as well as systems were the surface electronic structure is expected to differ from the bulk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical status</head><p>The technical part of this project consisted of the construction and installation of a new beam line endstation built around a Gammadata SES-2002 electron energy analyzer. The energy range and angular resolution put new requirements on the experimental setup and in particular on the analyzer and the sample alignment. Even though there are still technical improvements to be made, as discussed below, the project has successfully achieved the technical goals. At present, the system is capable of recording valence band spectra with an angular resolution of 0.15 o in the analyzer slit direction and 0.2 o perpendicular to the slit. An early problem with defects on the analyzer entrance slits has been resolved by exchanging the slits. These repairs were done during the spring 2002 and resulted in a 6 month delay of the project. The combined energy resolution obtainable with the system is of course related to the recording time and cross-section but for most samples, spectra with 100-150 meV resolution can be recorded in approximately 1h with photon energies in the 400-800 eV range.</p><p>The requirements on sample alignment lead to the construction of a sample holder with six degrees of freedom. The need for having a vertical tilt angle motion has to some extent been decreased by positioning the analyzer entrance slit in the vertical plane. This has as a consequence that an offset in the tilt angle of the sample only shifts the angular window of the analyzer and is therefore not something that needs to be corrected in most cases. The other angular motions are, however, still critical and improvements in the calibration and precision in these movements would facilitate the experimental work.</p><p>The technical status of setup is summarized in the following list:</p><p>• Analyzer with 0.15 o / 100meV resolution. (The energy resolution is flux limited.) • Measurement chamber with &lt;10 -10 mbar, LEED equipped • Sample holder with six degrees of freedom and 23 K on sample • Preparation chamber witch &lt;10 -9 mbar, heating, sputtering and evaporation • Fast entry load-lock and sample storage • Software for automatic data acquisition permitting multiple scans for varying energies and polar angles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible technical improvements</head><p>Part of the sample alignment is at present a tedious process since azimuthal angles and centering of the manipulation rotational axes has to be done in a trial and error fashion. Technical solutions to facilitate this process has been discussed with the beam line staff and are to some extent envision for the future.</p><p>It has also become clear that many samples do not fulfill the very high flatness requirements that are posed by high energy measurements. This problem is related to spot size since a smaller spot size would increase the chance of finding a sufficiently flat part of the sample surface. In general terms the signal to noise ratio therefore scales with the spot size. It would thus be very beneficial for angular resolved measurement if the x-ray beam could be refocused horizontally as well as vertically.</p><p>The linearity of the angular distribution and resolution of the analyzer is a trade off with the spot size. The relatively small spot size at ID08 permits a better than standard angular distribution and linearity. The Gammadata company has been contacted in this matter and have promised to deliver new analyzer voltage tables that would exploit this. So far these tables have not been delivered.</p><p>A new detector read out system will soon be available on the market. This new system will permit point by point calibration of the detection system and should therefore drastically increase the possibility of doing experiments that rely on relative intensity differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Highlights of experimental results</head><p>During the first two runs of the project, the major part of the beam time was spent on verifying the feasibility of high energy ARPES and the influence of temperature and photon energy on phonon scattering in the photoemission process. The valence band dispersions of Al, Cu, TaSe 2 and NiO were measured during these runs and some of the results are shown below.</p><p>In the figure on the left, Cu valence band data measured at a photon energy of 580 eV are presented. Due to the analyzer slit problems mentioned above, the relative intensities are not correct and the spectrum has been normalized to equal maximum intensity. Irrespective of this, the Cu d band dispersion can be clearly seen between 2 and 8 eV binding energy as can the Cu s-p band with its parabolic dispersion crossing the Fermi level at a parallel momentum of approximately 0.4 Å -1 . Unexpected is, on the other hand, that the peak width for the lower temperatures decreases in going from 640 eV to 760. This is difficult to explain and might be due to something that is not intrinsic to the photoemission process. It is noteworthy that the smallest MDC width at 760 eV is approximately 0.15 Å -1 . This value should be compared to the photon momentum of 0.19 Å -1 , which demonstrates that the photon momentum does not contribute substantially to the broadening but rather induces a shift ot the measured dispersion.</p><p>As an example of the direct application of the HARPES technique to a strongly correlated threedimensional material, we have measured the prototypical Mott-Hubbard system NiO. A color topological plot of the NiO valence band, recorded with hν=610 eV, is shown below. Blue color indicates low intensity and green, yellow and red indicate increasingly higher intensities. (Note that the color scale is non-linear.) A very high intensity is seen in the 2-4 eV region. This intensity is according to calculations due to Ni t2 g bands i . At 9-10 eV binding energy there is a feature that disperses to lower binding energy and back as one goes from Γ to X. This feature is most likely Ni e g related. Apart from these features, there is also a highly dispersive feature that crosses over from the upper to the lower part of the valence band as the momentum increases. The interesting point here is that the main intensity seems to follow the dashed line in the figure while the T=RT T=120K T=23K Photon energy (eV) Width (Å ) -1 MDC peak widths T=RT T=120K T=23K</p><p>0.26 0.24 0.22 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.14 0.12 0.10 0.08 dispersion follows the dotted lines. This kind of behavior has not been observed before in NiO and indicates the presence of two competing potential of different periodicity. The main intensity follows the dispersion resulting from the normal lattice potential whereas the symmetric dispersion is the result of the antiferromagnetic ordering with twice the periodicity. It has been shown ii that the amount of spectral weight transferred into the bands originating from the competing potential scales with the strength of the potential. The relative weight in the feature that disperses towards lower binding energy for k &gt; 0.5 can therefore be used to extract an estimate for the strength of the antiferromagnetic potential. Note also that the spectral intensity in the 9 eV feature is distinctively higher at X as compared to Γ. Low energy ARPES data display additional peaks in the 5 eV region and they have been interpreted as proof of antiferromagnetic influence on the band structure iii,iv . The data presented here do, on the other hand, not show any sign of an extra flat band in this region. In our opinion, the difference between our high-energy data and the low energy data stems from the assumption of a free electron like final state in the analysis of the low energy data. This assumption is highly questionable in a strongly correlated system such as NiO and is therefore likely to introduce erroneous features in the experimentally derived dispersion relations. Further details and discussions about these results can be found in the appended preprint.</p><p>Another topic that has been studied within the project is the photon energy dependence of angle resolved photoemission data from the high temperature superconductors. Unfortunately, despite the use of many different samples, the above mentioned problem with highly flat surfaces limited our results to the Nd 2-x Ce x CuO 4-δ (NCCO) system. By performing angular scans covering the whole Brillouin zone, we were able to reconstruct the experimental Fermi surface for NCCO. The result of such a compilation is shown to the left. The very low intensity at the Fermi level in these materials makes these kinds of measurements at high energy very difficult. From the figure it is, however, clear that there are repeated Fermi hole like surfaces centered around (π,π). The nature of the Fermi surfaces in cuprates has been a source of debate in recent years because of their apparent photon energy dependence. Our results confirm the hole like nature of the Fermi surface in NCCO and rules out any remaining doubt in this issue. By utilizing the required symmetry of the Fermi surface and averaging over the repeated surfaces in the figure it is possible to produce a Fermi surface image of higher quality. The result of such a folding and averaging is shown on the left. The shape and intensity around the Fermi surface is now well defined. The almost diamond like shape of the Fermi surface is much more quadratic than the rounder shape observed at low energy v . A possible explanation for this difference is the increased bulk sensitivity in our measurements. In this scenario, the bulk electronic structure would differ from the surface due to the difference in interlayer coupling. The question about doping differences between the surface and bulk also arises in this context. By measuring the Fermi surface volume we determine the doping level to x=0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> which is close to the nominal doping of x=0.15 and thus in agreement with Luttinger's</p><p>0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 E F 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Binding energy (eV) k (2 /a) p NiO (001) valence band at h =610 eV n G X Intensity (au) Γ (π,π) Folded Fermi surface of Nd Ce CuO 1.85 0.15 4-d Fermi surface of Nd Ce CuO hv = 400 eV 1.85 0.15 4-d</p><p>theorem. This fact implies that the bulk electronic structure fulfills the conditions for Luttinger's theorem to be valid. Earlier low energy data confirms that also the surface doping is in agreement with Luttinger's theorem. It would thus seem that the difference in shape between the Fermi surfaces measured at low and high photon energy is not due to differences in doping but rather in environment. The uncertainties in the determination of the Fermi surface volume are, however, so large that it is not possible to completely rule out differences in doping between the bulk and the surface. Apart from differences in the shape of the Fermi surface between the low and high energy data there is also a difference in intensity. Where the intensity is high in our data (dark red in the figure above) the low energy data show low intensity. The low intensity in the low energy data was attributed to π,π scattering that connects the Fermi surfaces in neighboring zones and thus decreases the quasiparticle lifetimes at the Fermi level. By comparing data recorded at 16.5eV, 55eV and our data it seems clear that there is no sign of significant π,π scattering and the low intensity spots in the 16.5 eV data were most likely due to matrix element effects. More details on these issues and further experimental data are presented in the appended manuscript below. Finally, we have very recently attempted obtain photoelectron interference patterns. The analysis of these data is currently under way but an example of an observed pattern is shown below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PhotoElectron Interference Pattern (PEIP) from NiO</head><p>The intensity pattern as a function of angle has been obtained by integrating the d band intensity from a NiO thin film measured with the photon energy tuned to the Ni 2p resonance at hν = 852 eV. Even though the nonlinear properties of the analyzer make the data analysis difficult one can clearly see a diamond like pattern. (White dashed lines are guides to the eye.) The angles between the observed spots correspond approximately to the angles one would expect for a pattern that results from interference between electrons coherently emitted from different Ni atoms. Further analysis of the data as well as comparisons with multiple scattering photoelectron diffraction calculations are necessary to determine if the observed pattern can be explained within photoelectron diffraction theory or whether the pattern is the result of interference between coherently emitted multiple electrons.</p><p>i O.

Lett. 87, 147003 (2001)</p><p>NiO is often considered as the prototypical strongly correlated system and was taken as an example already in N.F. Mott's seminal 1949 paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for many years but a satisfactory understanding of its electronic structure is still lacking. The most obvious problem in the description of NiO is that it has a partially empty d-band but is, nonetheless, an insulator with a large band gap on the order of 4 eV. Correspondingly, local density approximation (LDA) calculations describes NiO as a metal rather than an insulator. A straightforward remedy to this problem is to include the magnetic ordering in the calculations and to perform local spin density approximation (LSDA) calculations. Such a calculation correctly describes NiO as an insulator albeit with a small band gap. The possible importance of magnetism in explaining the insulating behavior of NiO was pointed out almost two decades ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Even though the LSDA approach probably underestimates the importance of strong correlation in the Ni 3d band it raises the important question of the relation between antiferromagnetic order in NiO and the valence band electronic structure. A very powerful technique in the investigation of electronic structure is angle resolved photoemission (ARPES). One of the strongest arguments for the use of ARPES is the ability to directly measure the spectral function A(ω, k). This argument is unfortunately not really true because of matrix element effects as well as the problem of determining the k vector component perpendicular to the sample surface. In recent years, there has been impressive progress in the energy as well as angular resolution obtainable with ARPES <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and high resolution ARPES has been exten- * Electronic address: oscar@kth.se sively applied to high T c superconductors and related two-dimensional materials. Unfortunately, the progress has not been extended to three-dimensional strongly correlated compounds. The inability to apply ARPES to these materials in a straightforward way is a serious impairment that stems from the non-conservation of electron momentum in the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. In one or two-dimensional materials this is not a serious problem since no dispersion is expected in this direction. For three-dimensional materials on the other hand, the dispersion in the perpendicular direction is as important as in any other direction and cannot be neglected. The classical way to deal with this problem has been to measure normal emission spectra as a function of excitation energy and to assume a free electron like final state. The assumption of a free electron like final state is obviously not a very good one for a strongly correlated compound if the excitation energy is low.</p><p>In this letter we present another approach to this problem and show that by going to high excitation energies and utilizing the latest advances in synchrotron radiation and electron detection techniques the energy versus momentum dispersion of the prototype system NiO can be determined in a straight forward manner. Furthermore, it is shown that earlier results indicating the influence of antiferromagnetic order on the dispersion relations were the result of difficulties with the application of low energy ARPES to this system. The high energy results presented here do, on the other hand, show a previously unobserved dispersion symmetry originating from the antiferromagnetic ordering.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, the photoelectron momentum and angles involved in an ARPES measurement at two different energies are depicted. In the low energy case, which is representative for typical UPS synchrotron or He lamp measurements, the kinetic energy of the photoelectron is ≈20 eV. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, the angle to cover a typical Brillouin zone is several tens of degrees and the corresponding kspace line is considerably curved. On the other hand, if the energy is increased to ≈600 eV, the angle needed to cover a Brillouin zone is on the order of a few degrees and the corresponding k-space curvature is small compared to the zone size. This fact implies that if parallel detection is used, the dispersion along a high symmetry line can be recorded in a single measurement even for a sample with a three dimensional electronic structure.</p><p>The high excitation energy has several other important advantages as compared to the corresponding low energy measurement. One advantage that is very important in the case of strongly correlated systems is that the high energy of the photoelectron results in a state that is effectively decoupled from the many body state of the system and thus free electron like. This is not necessarily true in the case of low energy ARPES where strong final state effects can effectively hamper the interpretation of spectra as noted below. Another advantage, in the case of bulk properties, is that the increased mean free path of the photoelectron enhances the bulk sensitivity of the measurement as compared to low excitation energies. In the energy range 20 -100 eV where most ARPES measurements are conducted, the escape depth is minimal and the observed intensity dominated by the outermost atomic layer. At 600 eV or higher kinetic energies, the intensity is dominated by emission from the second and deeper layers. For materials where the surface electronic structure is different from the bulk this is of course very important. An example of the importance of the difference between bulk and surface electronic structure in strongly correlated materials is given by studies on Ce compounds where this difference has been shown to be very significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The advantages of going to high energy in ARPES come at the cost of lower cross-sections and lower photon energy resolution. Recent advances in photon source and detector technologies can resolve this problem to a large extent and some angular resolved spectra at high energy have already been obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. It is expected that in the near future, new and existing beamlines at third generation light sources will be able to collect angle resolved spectra with 0.05 degree angular resolution and ≈30 meV energy resolution at 700 eV.</p><p>At the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF a new high flux beam line for photons in the 400-1500 eV range was recently commissioned. The beam line, ID08, produces ≈ 10 13 photons/s/0.1%BW on sample with a resolving power of ≈ 10000 at 400 eV. Coupled to the new beam line is an experimental chamber equipped with a Gammadata SES-2002 electron energy analyzer. This set-up permits the collection of ARPES spectra with an angular resolution of 0.15 • along the analyzer slit and 0.2 • in the perpendicular direction.</p><p>Attempts to apply low energy ARPES to NiO have focused on fits of normal emission data to free electron like final states <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. A key issue in these studies is the relation between the antiferromagnetic ordering and the electronic structure. The low energy ARPES results were interpreted as supporting LSDA calculations where the antiferromagnetic structure of NiO is taken into account. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the results of LDA and LSDA calculations are shown. The calculations were performed with the WIEN2k program <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> using a cubic lattice with a = 4.19 Å. The obtained results agree well with earlier calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The top part of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the LDA calculation for Γ → X (left) and L = π/a(111) → L = π/a(311) (right), while the bottom part shows the LSDA calculation for the Γ → X direction. In the LSDA calculation, the amount of Ni 3d character in the calculated bands has been indicated by the use of varying marker size. Comparing the top and bottom parts of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, one sees that the main effect of including the antiferromagnetic ordering is to reduce the size of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and thus to fold in the bands from the L = π/a(111) → L = π/a(311) direction into the Γ → X direction. As a result of this folding, there is a flat band at ≈5.5 eV binding energy in the antiferromagnetic calculation. Low energy ARPES data that showed features at or close to this band were therefore interpreted as evidence for the influence of magnetic ordering on the electronic structure. As mentioned above, the assumption of a free electron like final state is, however, not a reasonable assumption for a strongly correlated system at low excitation energies. Furthermore, because of the k-space curvature depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, angular scans cannot be utilized to measure along a given symmetry line. As can also be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>, the angular scan do, however, give a good approximation of a linear scan at high energy. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, such an angular scan is presented. The data were collected at room temperature, which is well below the Néel temperature of NiO (T N = 525K). The photon energy of 610 eV was chosen so that normal emission corresponds to the Γ-point. In order to enhance low intensity features, the color scale is nonlinear. At 2 eV binding energy, one sees the almost dispersionless high intensity Ni 3d bands. The Ni 3d labeling should, however, not be taken literally since these states are best described in a configuration interaction cluster model with strong O 2p Ni 3d hybridization. It has also been shown that the top of the valence band is of 3d 8 L character <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>(L denotes a hole on the oxygen ligands) and that NiO therefore is a charge-transfer insulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Another weakly dispersing feature is observed at ≈ 9 eV binding energy but this feature is much less intense. The 9 eV band is reproduced by the LSDA calculation in the lower part of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> but has also been attributed to a Ni 3d 7 satellite <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Between these two flat bands there is a weak but rapidly dispersing feature. The latter has also been observed by low energy ARPES and attributed to O 2p states because of its similarity to the calculated bands of O 2p character in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The low cross-section for this state seems to support this <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. There is, on the other hand, no sign of any flat band in the 5 to 7 eV binding energy region as predicted by the LSDA and LSDA+U calculations and reported in the low energy ARPES measurements. As seen from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the amount of Ni 3d character in the flat band is expected to be higher than in the rapidly dispersing band and the cross-section for the flat band should therefore be correspondingly higher. The fact that no flat band is observed in our measurements is therefore evidence that the observation of such a band in low energy ARPES <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> was most likely due to non-free-electron like final states. One should, however, not forget that the LSDA calculation describes the ground state of the system whereas the photoemission final state is an excited state and that a disagreement between the two not necessarily invalidates the LSDA approximation. It is, nevertheless, clear from the present data that LSDA and LSDA+U calculations cannot be used to describe the observed valence band dispersion. The current experimental results do, however, confirm that there are rapidly dispersing features and that any theoretical description of NiO needs to take the translational symmetry into account. A more important result that is seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> is that the dispersion seems to be symmetric around the k = 0.5 (in units of 2π/a) point. This is seen both through the beginning of a feature dispersing up again from high to low binding energy as k is increased from ≈ 0.5 to X as well as in the weak dispersion in the 9 eV band. This symmetry has not been observed previously and is not expected unless the halving of the Brillouin zone size due to the antiferromagnetic ordering is taken into account. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and mentioned above, the main effect of the inclusion of magnetic ordering is to fold in the bands from (π/a)(111) to (π/a)(311). Since this is a consequence of the Brillouin zone size reduction resulting from the antiferromagnetic ordering, it does not depend on the exact form of the bands and a similar result with symmetric bands can be expected even if these bands might have a dispersion quite different from what is seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As a consequence, the dispersion symmetry observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> is evidence of the Brillouin zone size reduction resulting from the antiferromagnetic ordering. The exact shape of the dispersion is, on the other hand, not in agreement with the LSDA calculation and adds further to the discrepancy between the calculation and the observed dispersion. Even though the dispersion in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> is symmetric around the k = 0.5 point, the intensity is not. It is seen that the 9 eV band carries more spectral weight in the k = 0.5 → 1 region whereas the rapidly dispersing O band carries more weight in the k = 0 → 0.5 region. This fact is easily explained by the continuous transfer of spectral weight that occurs when the periodicity of the lattice is changed by the introduction of a new potential. The spectral weight in the bands introduced by the new symmetry increases smoothly as the strength of the potential is increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In the present case, this implies that spectral weight in the rapidly dispersing band below k = 0.5 should be transferred to the new branch of this band that has appeared above k = 0.5. Similarly, one expects weight in the 9 eV band to be transferred from the right to the left. The extent to which this occurs is a measure of the relative strength of the antiferromagnetic potential as compared to the non-magnetic lattice potential. As seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, the main intensity is still confined to what can be called the non-magnetic band but there is also a non negligible intensity in the rapidly dispersing band above k = 0.5. This shows that the antiferromagnetic potential is a weak but non negli-gible perturbation on the non-magnetic lattice potential. While contradicting previous results interpreted as antiferromagnetic influence on the valence band dispersion, the present data therefore show a new and more direct form of evidence of antiferromagnetic influence on the valence band.</p><p>In conclusion, the presented data show the feasibility of high energy angle resolved photoemission and that this kind of measurements can provide new and valuable information about strongly correlated three-dimensional systems. In the present example of measurements on NiO, the observed dispersion was not in complete agreement with earlier low energy measurements. While indications of a flat band around 5 eV binding energy in low energy measurements was not observed in the present data, a previously not observed symmetry in the dispersion gives direct evidence for the importance of the antiferromagnetic potential on the valence band electronic structure. It is expected that many new results will emerge from the application of high energy angle resolved photoemission to other strongly correlated three-dimensional materials as well as materials with differences between bulk and surface electronic structure. Most transition metal and rare earth compounds have p and d levels in the 500-1000 eV range, which also opens up the possibility of doing selective resonant angle resolved photoemission on a wide range of materials.</p><p>Valuable discussions and comments from L.H.

Both the parabolic in plane dispersion as well as dispersion in the normal direction as a function of photon energy are clearly seen. Another prominent feature in these data is the temperature dependence of the signal to background ratio. The result of a more detailed study of the momentum broadening as a function of photon energy and temperature is shown in the figure on the left. It demonstrates that the peak width in momentum increases with increasing photon energy as expected.</figDesc></figure>
