<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Proposal summary: Incommensurate composite structures can be considered as a new state of matter with specific structure, properties and dynamics. The goal of the experiment was to measure this dynamics in the prototype organic host-guest nonadecane-urea inclusion compound. In particular, gap and anomalous damping of pseudoacoustic collective modes predicted by theoretical papers was investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions:</head><p>A high energy resolution was reached with <ref type="bibr">(Si 12,</ref><ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref> analysers configuration. The energy resolution was announced equal to 1.7meV full width at half maximum. Due to the low interaction of X-ray with light atoms, organic materials have penetration depth of the order of 10mm; thus the samples few mm long are required. A large nonadecane-urea single crystal of ~10 mm long and ~8 mm large was successfully grown and was used. The obtained IXS spectra presented rather good statistics within few hours scans. Despite the large crystal size, an exceptionally good mosaicity was observed (less than 0.1 degree).</p><p>As proposed, the first part of the experiment was performed at room temperature. Supplementary low temperature measurements were performed in order to reduce phonon damping and to analyse the process in the other crystallographic superspace phases. This was done using a displex cryostat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical problem encountered and possible improvement:</head><p>Temperature environment did not allow attaining very low temperature and neither to make precise temperature dependence measurements. Solutions for future experiments at low temperature exist using a low T He flow cryostat for example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The main obtained results are the following:</p><p>1. Due to the accessibility to large value of Q (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ), we could for the first time measure the host longitudinal-acoustic (LA) phonons along the direction of the incommensurate wave vector c*(around 0 0 6 0 and 0 0 12 0 Bragg peaks) (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Such Bragg peaks are not accessible using cold neutrons. We could by this way extract the urea dispersion branch and the associated damping confirming the very original features that we recently published measuring along a non pure longitudinal direction [1] (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).  2. Elasticity theory of periodic crystals require that transverse phonons propagating along a direction and polarized along another direction perpendicular to the propagation direction propagate at the same velocity as the transverse phonons obtained by exchanging the directions of propagation and polarization. This symmetry rule is broken for aperiodic structures due to the existence of an intermodulation related to an additional dimension. In that case, different slopes would be related to the absence of restoring forces between the two sublattices along the aperiodic direction. This fundamental question has been investigated here, measuring the phonon dispersion branches propagating and polarized along the (2 2 0 0) and (0 0 12 0) directions. Data analyses are in progress. 3. Several other exploratory studies were performed around previously determined interesting diffuse scattering positions in the reciprocal space. By this way, different information will be extracted concerning the translational and rotational molecular disorder of the guest and on the pretransitional critical phenomena.</p><p>4. The attempt to measure phonons around the real center of the Brillouin zone was unsuccessful due to the low inelastic structure factor around Q=0. Further calculations will be done to try to explain this observation.</p><p>5. Due to the relatively high intensity of the satellite Bragg peaks on this spectrometer, we decided to tackle the problem of the collective dynamics at a intermodulation satellite position. Due to limited time, this study was done at a single temperature in phase II. An overdamped low frequency mode seems to emerge from the (0 0 6 1) Bragg peak. If this is confirmed, this could be interpreted as the sliding mode and would constitute the very first unambiguous observation of this theoretically predicted excitation. Major information concerning interaction will be extracted from the obtained spectrum. Therefore a complete temperature analysis is strongly required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>This first experiment of inelastic X-ray scattering on an aperiodic organic crystal was quite successful. The inelastic signal was strong enough and the energy resolution appears to be sufficient to answer many of our questions. The possibility of a direct observation of the sliding mode has to be confirmed. This would open a very exciting field of research in this family of materials. Systematic and precise studies with temperature will be needed to understand the original dynamics of this aperiodic crystal. The contribution of Alexey Bosak as local contact was essential in the success of the experiment.</p><p>[1] B. Toudic, R. Lefort, C. Ecolivet, L. Guérin, R. Currat, P. Bourges, and T.
