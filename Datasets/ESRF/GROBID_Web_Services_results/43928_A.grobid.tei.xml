<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During our experiment period, we have studied the molecular-scale speciation of As and Pb in 8 selected contaminated bulk soil samples aiming to assess differences in metal sorption mechanisms resulting from water flow domains through the soil (Report 1). In addition, we could perform preliminar studies of As speciation in two samples of colloidal particles isolated from bulk contaminated soil on the basis of the application of Field-Flow Fractionation methods. This research will center a new proposal for beamtime in Spline (BM25A beamline) (Report 2).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report 1:</head><p>Preferential flow is the rapid non-equilibrium movement of water and solutes through soils that bypasses a large portion of the soil matrix thus affecting a small portion of the soil volume. These phenomena limit the sorbing and buffering capacity of the soil and reduce the residence time of solutes accounting for a significant, increased risk of groundwater contamination from soil. Although preferential flow has been proved to enhance the transport of reactive agrochemicals, little research on the effects of macropore flow on trace metals leaching has been conducted. The main objective of the project in which frame our XAS experiments were planned was to study the geochemical behaviour and distribution of As and Pb in contaminated soils and to elucidate the role of preferential water flow phenomena on their sorption mechanisms in the soil. By means of dye tracer experiments to stain preferential flow paths in natural soils, an intensive soil sampling procedure and proper statistical analysis, previous investigations included the macroscopic description of the spatial distribution and chemical speciation of the elements in soils through total metal content quantification and a sequential chemical extraction protocol. In the last step of our research, XAS analysis were performed on selected soil samples representing bulk soil matrix and preferential flow domains to identify differences in the molecular-scale sorption mechanisms of the elements between these two flow domains taking advantage of the technical characteristics of BM25A beamline.</p><p>During our experiment, XAS measurements were performed in fluorescence mode and at room temperature at the Pb L III and As K, adsorption edges on four selected soil samples obtained from two contaminated scenarios chosen for the purpose of the project. The SpLine X-ray energy range (5 -35 keV) allowed determination of both Pb and As edges, obtaining high quality spectra data (on the basis of colecting enough scans from each experimental case), even more with the recently adquired new 13 elements solid state detector at SpLine. Further data collection for Pb was abandoded after running the first sample for 17 scans as we were unable to optimize an efficient signal/noise ratio. All As spectra are currently being analized using the computer packages Sixpack and EXAFSPAK (SSRL), together with ab initio reference phase shift and amplitude functions for EXAFS calculated with the program FEFF and calibrated against experimental reference compound data.</p><p>Our preliminary results show that within a given soil horizon and at the pedon scale, metal concentration as well as reactive soil solid phases such as organic matter and Fe oxi-hydroxide particles are not evenly distributed but it is significantly affected by water flow domains. Thus, preferential flow domains have significantly higher metal concentration as compared to matrix flow domains. However, first ad-hoc analysis of the spectra obtained from samples of both charactarized flow domains indicates that differences in mass of metals retained in the soil do not induce sizable differences in the main molecular-scale sorption mechanisms responsible for their retention (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In spite of it, as preferential patterns at large scales result from local preferential phenomena, the effect of these non-equilibrium water trasport on water contamination must be further studied. 0 1x10 6 2x10 6 3x10 6 4x10 6 5x10 6 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 0,1 1 -20000 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 Al27 Fe57 Intensity, cps Mn55 Diameter, ÔÅ≠m As75 0,1 1 Fig. 2. Element composition and colloidal particle size distribution for sample 47.</p><p>Report 2.</p><p>One of the main limitations for the development and application of models for description and prevention of pollution processes is the lack of knowledge on natural phenomena such as the association of toxic elements on colloids and their mobilisation as nanovectors of contaminants as well as on the potential effect of non-equilibrium physical processes in solute and water movement on the leaching of these nanovectors through preferential water flowpaths in the soil. Within this research line, we have a two-fold objective: (1) to study the role of soil natural colloidal particles as nanovectores of toxic elements in the contamination process of the soil-water system and (2) to evaluate the possible influence of water and solute preferential pathways as fundamental mechanism that leads to nanovector transport in contaminated soils. By means of an experimental plan including advanced techniques such as field-flow fractionation to characterize the soil colloidal fraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy for element speciation in colloidal surfaces, the scientific team of the project aims to investigate the fundamental mechanisms that determine the transport, retention and distribution of toxic elements in soils affected by toxic dumping, abandoned mine soils or agricultural soils.</p><p>With these purposes, we had the chance of analyzing two colloidal samples obtained from a contaminated soil to test the feasibility of a specific method to isolate the colloidal fraction and study the metal solid phase speciation on them. By means of an Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AsFlFFF) system coupled to an ICP-mass spectrometer, the colloidal fraction of two contaminated soil samples were characterized (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The colloidal size range with greatest concentration in As was isolated onto an ultrafiltration membrane which was transported to the beamline for XAS measurement. Following the same experimental conditions as explained before, EXAFS spectra were obtained and are currently analyzed (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>These results indicate that an experimental protocol to transfer samples from AsFlFFF-ICP-MS to XAS and other techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy is possible and will provide an advance in the current knowledge on the sorption and transport of toxic elements in contaminated soil materials. This investigations are currently in progress within the frame of the research project CGL2010-17434 financed by the Spanish National Research Plan and is object of a new proposal for beam time at the BM25A Spanish beamline. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Arsenic K-edge XANES, EXAFS and Fourier transforms (FT) Up: Guadalix; Down: Sao Domingos</figDesc></figure>
