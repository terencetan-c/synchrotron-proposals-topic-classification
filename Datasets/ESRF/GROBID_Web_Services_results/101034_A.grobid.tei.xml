<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main part of the experiment consisted in a detailed grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis of two samples of sub-monolayer domain coverage MoS2 films grown by MOCVD on Al2O3(0001) single crystal substrates pre-annealed at 1200ºC under either an O2 atmosphere, or a H2-enriched atmosphere, resulting in predominantly (1 × 1) or (√31 × √31)𝑅9Al-terminated surface reconstructions, respectively.</p><p>GIXRD in-plane reciprocal space maps of as-deposited samples: Beam energy was first set to 18 keV, but then 11.19 keV was found optimal to obtain the best film to substrate peak intensity ratio. The in-plane reciprocal space maps covered a large area ( = 80º) including several h00 and hk0 reflections from film and substrate. The measured maps are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The main difference between the samples is that the in-plane orientation of the MoS2 domains on O2-treated sapphire consists of about 97% of the so-called R0º orientation (basically a 3 x MoS2 unit cell on 2 x Al2O3 unit cell), while on H2-treated sapphire the MoS2 grows as a combination of about 75% R0º and 25% R30º (30º degrees in-plane rotated domains). For a more quantitative exploration of the film domain orientation we measured accurate radial scans (combinaton of  a b and  goniometrer angles) along the main crystallographic directions of the samples: //[010],[110],[100], as well as azimuthal scans ( scans) of the (110) MoS2 reflections. One of the most striking results was the observation of the persistence of the (√31 × √31)𝑅9</p><p>reconstruction of the Al-rich sapphire surface after MoS2 growth, as evidenced by the presence of multiple spots (marked with red arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>), which seems to be responsible for the loss of the R0º epitaxial arrangement of MoS2 domains in favour of R30º orientation. The difference in the domain arrangement is also depicted in the omega scans (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) of 100 and 110 MoS2 in-plane reflections of the asdeposited samples with an in-plane dispersion (mosaic spread) measured by the FWMH of about 2-3º and 10º for the O2-and H2-treated samples, respectively.</p><p>In situ high temperature annealing under H2S atmosphere:</p><p>The second part of the experiment was devoted to the analysis of the same crystallographic features (in-plane maps, radial and azimuthal linear scans) after having exposed the samples for 45 min at 600ºC and H2S atmosphere (0.025sccm, 1.8 10 -5 mbar). No substantial differences were observed for the in-plane domain arrangement of MoS2, neither in radial nor azimuthal scans.</p><p>In situ high Temperature vacuum annealing: Further annealing at 600ºC under UHV conditions (1.8 10 -9 mbar) was performed to account for possible desorption/de-intercalation of species and/or subtle reconstruction of the Al2O3 surface or MoS2 islands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-ray reflectivity (XRR) analysis</head><p>This experiment took advantage to carry out XRR analysis of the two different films as-deposited, as well as after H2S and vacuum annealing, in an attempt to explore the out-of-plane arrangement of atomic planes and distances between the S-Mo-S trilayer sheet to the outermost Al layer of Al2O3 (i.e. van der Waals gap). As observed in the XRR scans in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> the films on O2-and H2-treated substrates show different behaviour. In the H2-treated substrates there is a variation between as deposited and after H2S annealing, while subsequent annealing in UHV left this sample unchanged. An atomic layer model is necessary to extract any information about interlayer distances at the MoS2/Al2O3 interface.
