Garbarino Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Sandra NINET -IMPMC -Paris Frédéric DATCHI -IMPMC-Paris Jean-Antoine QUEYROUX -IMPMC -Paris Gunnar WECK -CEA -Bruyères le Chatel</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this proposal was to study the thermodynamic properties and P-T boundaries of the superionic phase of ammonia. This phase has been observed above 57 GPa and 700 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and is located between the molecular phases and the fluid phases. In this experiment HC1346, we have started to investigate the precise measurements of the melting curve of ammonia as it a good way to access to the superionic phase. Previously, a recent work reported melting points up to ~60 GPa using Raman spectroscopy and indirect YAG laser heating via a Ir coupler, and showed a surprising decrease of the melting temperature above 35 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, the Raman spectra of the solid and fluid phase at melting are very similar, casting doubt on the ability to detect melting with this method. Moreover, the III/IV transition temperatures reported by these authors are much larger (T=700 K) than those determined by resistive heating <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In our experiment, rather than using indirect YAG laser heating via a coupler (NH 3 does not absorb YAG laser), we have used direct heating of NH 3 with a CO 2 laser, thus preventing from any chemical reaction between ammonia and the coupler. Moreover, to detect clearly the melting line, we used the new multichannel collimator in EH2 developed during the long-term project HD463. With this set up, we were able for the first time to observe the x-ray diffraction pattern of liquid NH 3 at high pressure and high temperature. Melting was detected thanks to the appearance or disappearance of the x-ray diffraction of the liquid. In total 4 DACs were loaded in our laboratory with ammonia using a cryogenic method. To measure the pressure, all cells were loaded with ruby and a small piece of gold for which the equation of state is well known. Temperatures were measured by optical pyrometry. Among the 4 loaded cells, only two have been studied because we have had technical problem with the two others DAC dedicated to the high pressure (diamond anvils with 200*300 micron culets) : for one cell, the sample escaped (likely through the anvils) during the laser heating alignement, and for the other one, the gas-input capillary broke when installing the DAC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained :</head><p>During this run, we could detect melting points of NH 3 up to 30 GPa from the appearance or disappearance of the X-ray scattered diffuse signal of the liquid. For example, figure <ref type="figure">1 (c</ref>) show the evolution of the XRD pattern of NH 3 across the melting line at 19 GPa. These patterns were collected with an acquisition time of 180 sec. We have removed the Bragg peaks from the solid phase to emphasize the liquid signal. Nonetheless, the diffuse contribution of the solid is still visible and increase with temperature. Remnants of the solid phase are always observed due to the colder layers of sample in contact with the diamond (no thermal insulation layer is used to avoid sample contamination or chemical reaction). There is however a clear difference between the fully solid and solid + liquid patterns, and this can even be more clearly appreciated on the 2D diffraction images where the liquid signal appears as a continuous diffuse halo (see figure <ref type="figure">1 (a)</ref> and <ref type="figure">(b)</ref>) . This allows a precise determination of the melting line. We have collected 4 (P,T) data for the melting line up to 30 GPa (these data are note presented here because there are not yet published). These point are, within uncertainties, in good agreement with the extrapolation of the melting measurements at moderate temperature obtained with resistive heating <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and differ from the recent laser heating data of Ojwang et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. At 30 GPa, our measurements of the melting curve incidentally crosses that of Ojwang et al, but we see no evidence for a bending down of the melting line up to 30 GPa as the latter work suggest. We also note that the ordered-disordered solid phase transition could be observed optically in our experiment thanks to the difference in birefringence between the two phases, but the transition temperatures were too low (below 1000 K) to be measured by pyrometry, in agreement with our previous resistive heating measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. We were not able to pursue these measurements to higher pressure because of the technical problems mentionned above. This run can thus be regarded as a half success, due in part to the impossibility of reloading NH 3 on site. We are however confident that we can measure the melting curve of NH 3 to higher pressures, as we have succesfully measured that of N 2 , whose scattering power is comparable to NH 3 , up to 85 GPa in our last run of HD-463 (see last exp. report of HD-463).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,49.20,494.75,496.90,220.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
