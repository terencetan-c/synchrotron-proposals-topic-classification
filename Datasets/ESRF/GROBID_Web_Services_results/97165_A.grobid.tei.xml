<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Structural resolution of Mg5(en)6(BH4)10</head><p>A highly complex crystal structure of stoichiometric Mg5(en)6(BH4)10 was solved from single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction at SNBL, and later confirmed by neutron powder diffraction (NPD) on isotopically substituted Mg(en)1.2( 11 BD4)2. We highlighted the role of the amorphous Mg(BH4)2 in the reactivity of the Mg(BH4)2-en system and characterized a previously overlooked phase, Mg(en)2(BH4)2.</p><p>The results of this work have been published in Dalton <ref type="bibr">Transactions, 52, 8, 2404</ref><ref type="bibr">Transactions, 52, 8, -2411</ref><ref type="bibr">Transactions, 52, 8, , 2023</ref> "Structural insight into the magnesium borohydride-ethylenediamine solid-state Mg-ion electrolyte system"</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Structure of a new Mn-based derivative of the MIL-53/47 MOFs</head><p>A new MOF, composed of infinity chains of Mn(III) bridged by terephthalate and methoxy ligands has been discovered by means of synchrotron powder and single crystal diffraction at SNBL. Owing to the similarities with those frameworks, we expect that this MOFs possesses rich redox chemistry, that might be similar to MIL-47, and that ligand modification might lead to pore size and modifications in breathing behaviour, as has been previously observed for the MIL-53 series. Work in this direction is currently underway and promising results, to be published soon, have already been obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Thermally induced structural changes in NH2 substituted LnBTC MOFs</head><p>We obtained a new kind of LnBTC (Ln = lanthanide) MOFs, also known as MOF-76, from aminotrimesic acid instead of the classical non-substituted trimesic acid. The influence of the presence of the amine group on the stability and fluorescent properties have been studied in house, and were complemented by variable-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction at SNBL to determine the structural changes occurring in these MOFs upon heating. Those changes have been monitored for the Tb and Eu-based MOFs with and without amine on the linkers, revealing an interesting flexible behavior. Furthermore, the experiments revealed a strong X-ray induced fluorescence in the green region of the spectrum for NH2-MOF-76(Tb). The results obtained from this work are currently part of a manuscript to be submitted soon.</p></div>		</body>
