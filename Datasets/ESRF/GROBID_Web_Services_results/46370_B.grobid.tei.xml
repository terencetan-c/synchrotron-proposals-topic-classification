<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The Pd(II) dimer 1, formed from the palladation of Pd(OAc) 2 with 2-phenylpyridine, can undergo oxidation to form Pd(III) dimer 2 (Scheme 1). An earlier attempt to examine this at the SuperSAXS beamline (X10DA) at the Swiss Light Source in the scanning mode (July 2010) met with only partial success. While an oxidation process is evident, the low flux of the beamline at the Pd K-edge did not allow the aquisition of sufficient quality data to confirm the solution structure of the oxidation product. By using the higher flux on beamline BM23, we hoped to be able to acquire structures of the Pd species in catalytically more relevant concentrations (1-20 mM) and, if possible, to conduct time-resolved studies.</p><p>Scheme 1. Oxidation of cyclometallated Pd(II) to a Pd(III) dimer.</p><p>We also made contigency for a second reaction system to be examined in case of unforseen problems with the original proposed experiment. This involved the examination of the reaction between the monophosphine-ligated Pd dimer 3 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) with different amines and an alkoxide base in solvents of very different polarity. This has particular relevance to catalytic aryl amination reactions, an important class of C-X bond forming reaction which has been widely used academically and industrially for the synthesis of organic molecules. 1 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reaction examined:</head><p>1. The scanning EXAFS spectrum of a solution of complex 1 in dichloroethane (40 mM) were initially recorded in the stopped-flow cuvette. Due to a combination of the chlorinated solvent (extensive absorption) and the small size of the window (1 × 1 mm), the available flux was too low to enable good quality spectra to be acquired. By adopting a larger (10 × 10 mm) cuvette, and by switching to chlorobenzene as a solvent (to reduce absorbance of the X-ray beam), the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased to allow good-quality spectra to be acquired. However, this effectively ruled out the primary goal of the proposal, which was to conduct time-resolved studies at lower concentrations. Furthermore, the concentrated solution of complex 2 generated in chlorobenzene was not stable in the beam, requiring freshly prepared solutions for each round of acquisition. Faced with these difficulties, it was decided that we focus the bulk of our efforts on the contigency project, while leaving this part of the work for a later proposal, e.g. to harness the higher flux available via the smaller spot size of the upgraded ID24. In the meantime, the scanning spectra acquired were sufficient for us to complete the preliminary studies on the solution structures of oxidised Pd(III) species, and this will be submitted for publication within the next few months.</p><p>Due to the small sample window afforded by the stopped-flow equipment, we also decided to conduct the rest of our experiments in the scanning mode, acquiring solution spectra in larger quartz cells to maximise beam size.</p><p>2. Switching over to the chemistry of the dimeric complex 3, further results were obtained. First, the spectrum of a solid sample of the chloro dimer complex 3 was recorded (for which the full strucuture has been previously elucidated by single crystal crystallography). The solution structure of the complex was subsequently examined in two solvents of different polarity: toluene and DMF (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, left hand spectrum), as our earlier work has shown that this can have an important effect on the nuclearity of the complex. 2 Indeed, differences in the spectra were observed, suggesting that the complex does indeed adopt a different distribution of solution structures, which is expected to affect their subsequent catalytic activity. This provides a keenly sort after explanation for the commonly observed effects of solvent upon this class of reactions.</p><p>3. Addition of hexylamine to both of the above solutions led to the formation of the same product species. Preliminary fitting suggests cleavage of the chloro bridge by the amine, to form a mono-nuclear, amine-coordinated complex (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, right hand spectrum). This will be analysed in greater detail. 4. Addition of an alkoxide base also led to distinct changes in the coordination sphere of Pd, although in this case there is a more significant solvent dependance. This data is currently under investigation. In summary, very useful data has been acquired using BM23 in the scanning mode. Timeresolved studies were not possible on this beamline due to the incompatibility of the stoppedflow equipment with the beam size. We propose that the acquisition of time-resolved spectra be conducted on the upgraded ID24, to try to delineate the kinetics of the process, and the possible involvement of a transient 3-or 5-coordinated intermediate due to the operation of a dissociative or associative process, respectively. This will form the basis of a future proposal. Preliminary results obtained with the scanning spectra will be disseminated via a publication within the next few months, with attendent studies conducted offline at Imperial College with complementary spectroscopic techniques such as NMR and UV-vis. Correlations with catalytic activity will also be made.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
