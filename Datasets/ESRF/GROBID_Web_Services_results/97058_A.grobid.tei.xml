<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Reciprocal Space Maps show changes in V2O3 in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameter accordingly to the different strain induced by the buffer layers. Previous to the beamtime we have performed VESTA (Visualization of Electronic and Structural Analysis) analysis in order to determine what crystalline diffraction peaks could be more sensitive to change in atomic positions. We have selected a series of reflection planes (as mentioned above) based on these calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and future work</head><p>This experiment is related to experiment 25-02-956 where the aim was to study the structural changes across the low temperature metal-insulator transition in V2O3 films with different thickness. Due to the COVID-19 situation both experiments were allocated to take place one after each other from 26/10/2021 till 05/11/2021. During this period of time there were some technical issues at ESRF causing the beam to be down for two and half days. Due to this extended beam downtime it was not possible to complete all the planned experiments. The analysis of the obtained results will represent a first approach to get a detailed picture on the relationship between structural and electronic properties in strained V2O3 thin films. Similar experiments in Cr-doped V2O3 films grown on different buffer layers can help to have a better understanding of the role played by structure in achieving a MIT at RT. Future experiments can also include the study of the structural changes across the low temperature transition for films subjected to different amount of tensile and compressive strain.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Abstract Cr-doped vanadium sesquioxide (V2O3) is a Mott insulator presenting an isostructural Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) between paramagnetic metallic (PM) and insulating (PI) phases close to room temperature (RT) for a limited range of doping (0.5% -1.7%). So far, this RT phase transition has been observed in bulk but has been elusive in thin films form. Very recently, a RT PM-PI transition both in pure and Cr-doped V2O3 thin films induced by strain engineering has been reported by the proposers (P. Homm et al., APL Materials 9, 021116 ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>)). The controlled strain of the V2O3 layers was achieved by growing epitaxial layers on (FeyCr1y)2O3 buffer layers with different Fe concentration. Novel intermediate states between the metallic and insulating phases, inaccessible in bulk materials, can be stabilized by a fine tuning of the engineered substrate lattice parameter. These results show that the control of the in-plane lattice parameter is extremely important to achieve a MIT at RT in V2O3 thin films. The detailed knowledge of the evolution of lattice deformations across this phase transition is therefore extremely relevant to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between lattice degrees of freedom and the electronic properties in this Mott material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental results</head><p>The samples studied in this beamtime were: -VCrO_021 (67 nm V2O3 on (Fe0.75Cr0.25)2O3/Cr2O3/Al2O3) -VCrO_021 (67 nm V2O3 on (Fe0.5Cr0.5)2O3/Cr2O3/Al2O3) -VCrO_021 (67 nm V2O3 on (Fe2O3)/Cr2O3/Al2O3) High-angle diffraction and low-angle reflectivity measurements were performed in all samples. These were complemented by a comprehensive series of theta-scans at room temperature around different reflections: (0 0 L), (4 -2 0), (6 -3 0), (1 0 10), (2 0 8), (4 -2 6). All measurements were done at RT. HAXPES experiments could not be performed as the substrates are highly insulating.</p><p>The aim of these experiments was to study the structural properties of V2O3 thin films subjected to different amount of strain induced by smart engineering of substrate templates.
