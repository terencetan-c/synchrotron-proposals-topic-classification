<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are metallic alloys with a disordered atomic arrangement, obtained via rapid cooling from the melt. Due to their unique engineering properties, BMGs have recently become candidates for additive manufactur ing methods such as laser powder-bed fusion <ref type="bibr">(LPBF)</ref>.</p><p>During this beamtime, we investigated the crystallization behavior of an industrial-grade Zrbased BMG powder, named ZR01, simultaneo us ly using fast calorimetry and synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques.</p><p>A commercial Flash DSC 2+ device of METTLER Toledo with an adapted furnace working under Ar flow for in situ diffraction was used on ID13. The calorimeter has been modified previously at our home institution to enable its integration into a synchrotron X-ray beamline. The FDSC external sensor support was placed vertically in the beam path, an opening was drilled at the bottom side of the sensor to allow the X-ray beam to reach the sample. Both sides of the support were closed by a polyimide window and the furnace was purged with argon to prevent sample oxidation. The layout of the resulted sample environment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The front cover of the furnace (white lid in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) was 3D-printed on site. We performed a series of measurements to determine the timetemperature-transformation (TTT) diagram of the ZR01 alloy in situ at the beam energy of 13 keV and beam size of 25 µm × 30 μm. The samples were measured as individual powder particles put on the calorimete r measurement sensor. The samples were fixated using a silicon oil and, after closing the measuring cell, purged by Ar at flow of 40 ml/min for at least 60 minute s. Subsequently, TTT diagrams upon cooling and heating were recorded and corresponding diffraction patterns were measured. The sample size was varied to observe the effect of the size on the crystallization kinetics. The sample size was measured ex situ using a SEM after finishing the experiment.</p><p>An example of a TTT diagram measured upon heating is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> left. The fast crystallization times indicate the presence of nuclei due to quenching of the sample to room temperature before recording the isothermal transformation, and a possible presence of oxides in the sample, which both act as heterogeneous nucleation sites. A SEM micrographs of the sample in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> right shows that the sample with diameter of 41 μm cracked during the in situ measurement, and reveals columnar radial microstructure. Sample cracking had previously been observed in the case of high crystallinity, which is in accordance with the fact that during a TTT diagram measurement, the sample was crystallized and melted repeatedly. The analysis of the corresponding diffraction patterns is ongoing. An exemplary XRD pattern is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> right.</p><p>Due to strains in the glassy samples and membrane of the chip sensors, samples often jumped when a measurement is initiated, resulting in sample loss and a new sample must be mounted. Multiple measureme nts were performed on each sample to achieve a good statistical representation, as the choice of powder particles on the sensor is not representative.
