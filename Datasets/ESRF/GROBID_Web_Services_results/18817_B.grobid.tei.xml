<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Summary</head><p>This was our second (and third) visit to ESRF with the BAG proteins structures project. We have utilized this time very effectively, collecting many data sets that had previously been impossible. These include two 1.8 Ang data sets of bacterioferritin at pH 9.0 and 9.3. Two data sets were collected on Alcohol dehydrogenase from Entamoeba histolitica at 2.0 and 1.8 Ang. resolution ( all previous attempts to collect this protein had resulted in only 3.2 Ang data ). A 1.7 Ang data set of an important streptavidin mutant was also collected, in addition to a series of high resolution Ferrodoxin measurements which reveal initial stages of the radiation damage in this protein.</p><p>We believe that this session was particularly fruitful for two main reasons. The first, and the most obvious is that we were already familiar with both the station and its working proceedures. Secondly there was a break of one day between our shifts due to scheduled maintainance, which aided tremendously our overall work effectiveness. We were able to both back up and process data during this off time, as well as return to data collection the next day fully rested.</p><p>Our second session in this time was in mid February. Despite severe difficulties with the beam at that time (only 10% intensity on the station ID14-3 and a loss of shifts to other users on ID14-1 and problems with beam focus on ID14-1 ) important and useful data were collected. A full 4.17 Ang data set of the complete Reaction center and a 1.7 Ang data set from a cellulosomal cohesin domain.</p></div>		</body>
