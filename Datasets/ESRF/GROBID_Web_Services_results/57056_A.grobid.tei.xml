<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Experiment ma2665 at ID11 involved studying a granular material, composed of over 1,000 ruby spheres, subjected to quasi-static 1D (oedeometric) compression cycles in-situ in the beamline. The goal of the experiment was to investigate force transfer and heterogeneity in a sample with a representative number of grains, and their influence on failure mechanisms such as force chain reorganization and grain fracture. The experimental methods included 3DXRD, x-ray tomography and interparticle contact force inversion techniques. These techniques have been developed for granular materials in previous experiments at ID11 (ma828, ma1216, ma1913; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>). The results represent the first known case in which a large assembly (over 1,000 grains) has been subjected to loading in-situ with simultaneous imaging in a manner allowing interparticle force network quantification. Experiment and measurements. -The granular sample was composed of 1,098 single-crystal ruby spheres with diameters between 80-120µm, as shown in the tomographic reconstruction in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The sample filled a 1.5 mm tall by 1.5 mm diameter volume inside of an aluminum (Al) cylinder. The cylinder was placed in a custom built uniaxial loading device with 360 • transparency, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. The sample was loaded with an upward acting piston while displacement and load were monitored with a displacement transducer and top-mounted load cell. The sample was loaded and unloaded three times, to three different axial force levels, and finally loaded to a crushing point before the experiment concluded, as illustrated in the load cell data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>. At regular increments of approximately 10N in loading and 30N in unloading, sample strain was held constant for approximately 40 minutes while 3DXRD and tomography scans were performed. Sample strain was also held constant for six scans during the final loading stage in order to investigate stress-relaxation effects close to sample failure. 3DXRD scans involved recording 2D diffraction patterns over sample rotation of 180 • in increments of 0.25 • . Tomography scans involved recording 2D transmission data as the sample was rotated 180 • in increments of 0.1 • . Results and Analysis. -We performed tomographic reconstruction and morphological grain segmentation (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) for all load steps and processed diffraction data (using methods from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) to obtain average tensor stresses for each grain in the sample. The homogenized sample stress from the diffraction data, similar to the average of the grain stresses, is illustrated Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> and demonstrates trends agreeing closely with macroscopic load cell readings in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>. The vertical components of individual grain stresses demonstrate increasing homogeneity with load, as recently suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> using data from ma1216 and ma1913 and visualized using the Gini coefficient for the current sample in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>. Deviatoric stresses within each grain are being analyzed and compared with known fracture criteria to locate imminent fracture events. Analysis of radiographic and tomographic images suggests that the sample degradation and failure was by means of grain fracture and strain localization. This hypothesis is being studied by analyzing center-of-mass (CoM) particle motion from 3DXRD data. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref> illustrates CoM particle motion, visualized by linking CoM positions for each grain with straight lines between adjacent load steps. As expected, more motion occurs at the bottom of the sample, where the loading piston is contacting the material. We also see more motion toward one side of the sample, highlighted with a dashed red line. This motion may correspond to a region with more frequent grain fractures and force chain rearrangements. We are currently exploring quantitative metrics for investigating nonaffine grain motion and employing force network reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, both of which will aid in interpreting these results. The findings of these studies will have significant implications for interpreting the bulk response of a granular material in terms of localized failure events.</p><p>!"#$ %&amp;'( 0 20 40 60 %&amp;)'** +,-#. 0 10 20 30 40 50 ! !! !
