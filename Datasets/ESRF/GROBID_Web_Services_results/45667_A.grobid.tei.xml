Shepherd*, Sylvestre Bonnet*, Philippe Guionneau, Salma Bedoui*, William Nicolazzi*, Gábor Molnár* Report:</p><p>The relative energy of the molecular orbitals (and hence the spin state of the complex) may be manipulated by the application of external pressure. High pressure studies of spin crososver (SCO) complexes using any experimental techniques are still relatively scarce; investigations which employ a variety of methods to probe both the structure and properties of these materials under pressure remain largely absent in the literature, but are vital to understanding the mechanism of SCO. i The application of an external pressure allows the finetuning of energy gaps (P∆V) as well as the separation (in many cases) of structural and spin-state changes. ii For example, in the [Fe(2-pic) 3 ] Cl 2 •EtOH complex the temperature-induced spin transition does not show a step at 1.35 kbar applied pressure. iii While thermally induced stepped spin transitions have been observed at elevated pressures, such a transition has never been observed in the isothermal regime purely as a function of pressure. A stepped transition with crystallographic symmetry breaking has not been observed in either regime; it is expected that increasing pressure will result in more gradual SCO behaviour and thus possibly preclude such symmetry-breaking phase transitions. iv However, it is certainly possible that the lack of such an observation is merely a result of the paucity of high pressure structural studies in this field. v Indeed, the majority of high pressure investigations involving SCO systems have used spectroscopic techniques or magnetic studies to characterise the effect of applied pressure on the spin transition. vi Very few studies to date have used diffraction techniques to explore the relationship between structure and properties of spin crossover materials under pressure, but such investigations are essential to establishing the driving forces behind the pressure-induced spin transition, as well as to investigating more complex phenomena such as stepped transitions.</p><p>We performed a high pressure single crystal X-ray diffraction study of [Fe(bapbpy)(NCS) 2 ] at ESRF ID27, which was complimented by high pressure magnetic and Raman spectroscopic investigations in our laboratory in Toulouse, allowing the mechanism of the unusual 2-step spin transition and associated symmetry breaking phase transition to be probed in detail. This mononuclear complex is known to undergo a two-step thermal spin transition involving an ordered high spin -low spin -high spin [HS-LS-LS] intermediate phase. Both steps involved in the spin transition are first order, show hysteresis associated with nucleation and domain growth phenomena and are accompanied by a crystallographic phase transition. In the intermediate phase one third of the iron sites are in the HS state and the remaining sites are LS. Combined variable pressure and temperature diffraction experiments were performed on beamline ID27 at the ESRF (X-ray wavelength = 0.3738 Å), using a MAR 345 image-plate detector and a beam focused to a diameter of approx. 3 µm. The sample was enclosed in a gas membrane driven DAC (culet diameter 600 µm) using a steel gasket; helium gas was used as the pressure transmitting medium. Pressure determination was performed using the ruby fluorescence technique. The cell was held in and a helium cryostat for cooling the sample or a heating collar for measurements above room temperature. On increasing the pressure a tripling of the c-axis was observed and associated with the appeareance of an intermediate phase (IP), demonstrated by the appearance of supercell reflections at (h,k,l±⅓) relative to the lattice at ambient pressure (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). For further increase of the pressure the diffraction pattern is complicated by the presence of multiple peaks which cannot be assigned to one lattice and was thus attributed to twinning (LS phase). Data collected at several values of pressure and temperature were used for phase identification and construction of a phase diagram, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Rather than the disappearance of the intermediate phase with pressure, as in the case of  3 ] Cl 2 •EtOH, it is clear that in 1 the IP may be observed across a large range of temperature and pressure. The pressure dependent crystallographic experiments presented here are indispensable to correctly interpret the spin transition curves obtained from magnetic and Raman measurements. They confirm clealry the unexpected stability of the intermediate phase under pressure.</p><p>Theoretical simulations have been undertaken to account for these observations using Ising-like models.  i Top.
