<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Date of experiment:</head><p>2. EXPERIMENTAL The following set of samples have been investigated at ID21: a) photochemically aged PB-based oil model paints (ca. 10 in total) obtained by mixing either the soluble (SPB) or the insoluble Prussian blue (IPB) in different mass ratios with 2 different white pigments: lead white [LW; PbCO 3 /Pb 3 (CO 3 ) 2 •(OH) 2 ] or zinc white (ZW; ZnO). b) Original paint micro-fragments (4 in total) obtained from selected (un)discoloured regions of two 18 th C paintings (SKM collection). c) set of Fe-reference powders (ca. 10 in total).</p><p>Model paint samples were analyzed before and after photochemical aging in the form of thin sections (2-10 µm in thickness), while micro-samples from real paintings were investigated as resin-embedded crosssections.</p><p>Measurements were performed at the scanning X-ray microscope (SXM) end-station of ID21 by means of a fixed exit double-crystal Si(220) monochromator.</p><p>The energy calibration was performed using an iron metallic foil and by setting the position of the peak maximum of its first order derivative spectrum at 7112 eV. The incident beam was focused by means of Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors down to a diameter of 0.88×0.4 µm² (h×v). Measurements in unfocused mode were performed using a beam with a diameter size between 100 μm and 250 μm. XRF signals were collected in the horizontal plane and at 69° with respect to the incident beam direction by means of either a single energydispersive silicon drift detector (Xflash 5100, Bruker) or a photodiode. Single point XANES spectra were acquired in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy across the Fe K-edge (7.100-7.297 keV; energy step: 0.5 eV; exposure time per energy step: 0.1 s).</p><p>A photon flux up to ca. 1×10 10 ph/s was employed and it was varied using attenuators. Fluence values between 6×10 7 -6×10 8 ph/μm 2 were estimated for the spectra recorded in unfocused mode, while fluences of 1-3×10 11 ph/μm 2 were calculated for those collected by means of the focused beam. The ATHENA software <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was used for the normalization and the linear combination fit (LCF) of the spectra against a library of XANES spectra of Fe -reference compounds.</p><p>During the μ-XRF mapping experiments, the fluorescence signals were produced by employing a monochromatic primary beam of fixed energy across the Fe K-edge. Maps of the same region of interest were recorded using 100 ms/pixel at three different energies: (i) 7.124 keV to favor the excitation of Fe II -species and other Fe-based compounds (e.g. oxyhydroxides/oxides, oxalates and or/sulfates);</p><p>(ii) 7.1304 keV and (iii) 7.3 keV to obtain the fluorescence intensity of Fe II /Fe III -species and all Fe-species, respectively. The software PyMca was used to fit the fluorescence spectra and to separate the contribution of different elements.</p><p>Total fluence values between 4×10 8 and 2×10 9 ph/μm 2 were employed during the μ-XRF mapping at the three different energies.</p><p>Full spectral (FS) μ-XANES mapping in XRF mode of regions of interest of the original paint micro-samples were performed using dwell times of 100 ms/pixel. A stack of n. 173 μ-XRF maps at energy increments around the Fe K-edge was recorded with the following step sizes: 2 eV before the pre-edge peaks and the absorption edge (7.092-7.108 keV), 0.5 eV around the pre-edge peak and the absorption edge (7.1085-7.136 keV), 1 eV just after the absorption edge (7.136-7.208 keV) and 2.5 eV in the post-edge absorption region. The deconvolution into elemental maps of the FS μ-XRF data (XANES stack) was performed using PyMCA.</p><p>The spectrocrunch library was employed to correct for the alignment of frames in the XANES stack, while TXM-Wizard <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> was used to fit the Fe K-edge XANES spectra and to produce the maps of different Fephases.</p><p>Total fluence values between 2×10 10 and 3×10 11 ph/ μm 2 were employed during the FS μ-XANES mapping investigations.</p><p>It should be noted that full-field XANES imaging investigations have been also performed on a selection of the model paints. Nevertheless, for most of them, especially for those containing higher relative amounts of lead white and zinc white with respect to Prussian blue, the analysis did not yield reliable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>3.1. Assesment of Prussian blue stability under exposure to SR X-ray micro-beam µ-XANES measurements and µ-XRF mapping at Fe K-edge have been performed to map the distribution of different Fe III /Fe II -cyanide compounds within the stratigraphy of (un)faded PB painting fragments with (sub)micrometric lateral resolution. It is reported that a high-flux X-ray radiation may cause damages on Prussian blue pigments, by inducing a reduction of Fe III ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. This makes tricky any detection of changes in the Fe II /Fe III ratio, that results from the original aging process of the pigment.</p><p>To face this shortcoming, first of all we have performed radiation damage tests on PB paint models, with the aim to find the safest working conditions in terms of time exposure and fluence (ph/μm 2 ). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the XANES spectra recorded by means of a focused beam do not show visible changes for fluence values up to of about 2-3×10 11 ph/μm 2 ; clear variations are clearly detectable instead for fluence values ≥ 1×10 12 ph/μm 2 . Specifically, such spectral modifications consist in a shift of the absorption edge toward lower energies accounting for the reduction of Fe III into Fe II . Furthermore, the intensity decrease of the white line (at ca. 7.1305 keV) and the intensity increase of the pre-edge peaks is attributable to the greater disorder and deformation of the octahedral coordination sphere of Fe-ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>The variations induced by the exposure to X-ray microbeam have been also exploited for selecting the energies for performing μ-XRF mapping at multiple energies around the Fe K-edge (see section 2 for details). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Photochemically aged PB-based model paints</head><p>After having found the safe working conditions of analysis and the appropriate energies to map variation of the Fe II /Fe III -cyanide distributions, µ-XRF mapping and single point µ-XANES analyses at Fe K-edge have been performed on the set of PB-based model paints.</p><p>As an example, the Fe-speciation results obtained from the unaged and aged mock-ups, prepared by mixing Prussian blue (soluble form) and lead white (1:50 weight ratio), are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. After light exposure, the paint surface exhibits a clear discoloration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>). Fe-speciation maps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>,C), show the presence of a higher relative amount of Fe II -species only within the uppermost 3 -10 μm of the aged sample. This is further confirmed by µ-XANES analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>): the spectrum acquired from the superficial degradation layer (red line) appear modified if compared with the profiles collected from the bottom part of the aged sample and from the unaged one (black line). Such modifications of the XANES profile resemble the changes observed during the beam damage tests (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) as well as those reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and they can be assigned to the partial reduction of Fe III to Fe II . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Original paint micro-samples</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the full spectral (FS) µ-XANES mapping results obtained from the analysis of a cross-section taken from the light exposed/faded blue area of the painting KMS588 (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The Fe-speciation maps and the corresponding µ-XANES spectra (Figure <ref type="figure">B</ref>,<ref type="figure">C</ref>) reveal that the superficial faded layer is mainly composed of Fe IIIoxyhydroxide along with minor abundances of Fe II -compounds, including sulfates and oxalates. Prussian blue is instead the main component of the blue paint underneath.</p><p>Based on earlier studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> the presence of Fe IIIoxyhydroxide has been interpreted either as a final degradation product of a deep fading of the original Prussian blue or as a residue of the manufacturing process of the pigment.</p><p>Nevertheless, considering that similar analyses performed on the unexposed/not faded crosssection (results not reported) reveal that Prussian blue is the dominant component of the entire paint stratigraphy, we can reasonably assume that, in the faded cross-section, Fe III -oxyhydroxide is a degradation product of the original PB pigment.</p><p>Overall the obtained results provide new significant information on the redox process involved in the photodegradation mechanism of Prussian blue as well as on the conservative story of the analyzed paintings. In addition, the present experiment lays the foundation for the development of a safe analytical working protocol for the analyses of Prussian blue pigments by synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-beams, by avoiding any radiation damage issue.</p></div>
