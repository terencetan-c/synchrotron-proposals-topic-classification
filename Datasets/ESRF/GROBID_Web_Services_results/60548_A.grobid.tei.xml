<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In Report:</p><p>In the experiment we have tested a new cell for the in-situ Grazing Incidence X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (GI-XAS) of Pd ultrathin films. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> describes the cell in detail. The basic concept is that at grazing incidence the spot of the beam on the sample is spread over a few cm in length. Considering the energy of the Pd Kα edge, a significant part of the spot is effective in producing the XAS signal. To achive the required flatness the samples were obtained onto glass microscopy slides. The slides where coated with a thin (100-150 nm) gold layer subsequently annealed to a chieve a iso-oriented polycristalline Au (111) surface. We pursued the controlled deposition of Pd by Cu underpotential deposition followed by displacement with PdCl2 electrolytes. This allowed us to get coverage from 0.66 ML up to 10 ML. In the first part of the experiment we perdformed ex-situ experiments, expoiting the possibility of the cell to work in this configuration. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> a shows the spectrum of a bulk palladium foil and a corresponding Pd oxide acquired during the experiment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> report the XAS acquisition performed on Pd layer corresponding to 0.66 ML. In this, we recognize all the features of Pd, showing the effectiveness of the set-up, especially due to the flatness of the electrode and the cell and the accurate control on Pd deposition.  In the last part of the experiment we have tested the cell for the acquisition of Fixed Energy X-ray Absorpion Voltammetry. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> (left) report the cell assembled for Grazing Incidence FEXRAV experiments inside the measurment chamber of BM08. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> (center &amp; right) shows a comparison between FEXRAV cycles performed using a Pd nanoparticle paste as working electrode (right, results from EXP MA-2936) and 10 monoloayers of palladium deposited on policrystalline isooriented Au (center). The FEXRAV pattern in the GI-XAS is much more resolved than in the FEXRAV experiments performed on conventional nanoparticles Pd catalysts; even the quality of the electrochemical data is much better in the grazing incidence set-up as this mallow a significant reduction of the catalyst surface area. Is worth mentioning that this are high quality data and that if completed with measurements performed in electrolytes that simulate fuel cell fuels (e.g. KOH + ethanol) will lead to high impact dissemination. For this reason we plan to apply for beamtime to extend the dataset to Pd ultrathin film of various thickness in electrolytes conaing renewable fuels for direct ethanol fuel cells.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Alessandro Lavacchi (CNR-ICCOM, Italian National Research Council, Institute for the chemistry of OrganoMetallic Compounds) *Andrea Giaccherini, *Enrico Berretti, (University of Florence -Chemistry Department) *Francesco di Benedetto (University of Florence, Earth Sciences department) *Giordano Montegrossi (CNR-IGG, Italian National Research Council , Institute of geosciences and earth resources)</figDesc></figure>
