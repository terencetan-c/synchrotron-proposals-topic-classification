<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Phase-contrast tomography of Norway spruce phloem </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of this ID19 experiment was to visualize conducting phloem anatomy in a number of Norway spruce (Picea abies) samples, and quantify the volume fractions and distributions of different types of phloem cells (i.e. sieve, albuminous, and parenchyma cells) as a function of sampling height, sampling time, tree age and tree size. Secondary aims were to visualize the sieve areas connecting adjacent sieve cells and to observe spatial variations in pathways for radial flow between phloem, cambium and xylem. From two trees, also a radial series of samples was scanned to obtain a comprehensive view of phloem structure from bark to cambium. For comparison with data produced with a home-lab x-ray microtomography system, a few samples were stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate, which tend to accumulate in nutrient-rich tissue such as parenchyma cells.</p><p>The experiment was initially awarded 3 shifts of beam time in September 2012; however, the scans taken during the first experimental session suffered from sample movement artifacts, and the manually corrected reconstructions were lost due to data transfer problems. The experiment was repeated in 3 additional shifts in March 2013 with weaker beam intensity. The second experimental session was very succesful, avoiding the sample movement problems nearly completely. All samples were scanned with a voxel size of 0.355 µm, using ~18 keV radiation and Paganin phase retrieval for enhanced contrast ( = 1500, with the exception of the stained samples, for which = 200). Additionally, roughly half of the samples were imaged with a larger voxel size of 0.7 µm to obtain a larger field-of-view.</p><p>The results are presently being analyzed at the University of Helsinki, with the aim of publishing them in the form of a peer-reviewed article in an international scientific journal in early 2014. Initial analysis indicates that all of the required quantities can be calculated based on the reconstructions; sieve areas between adjoining sieve cells are visible (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), and the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficient for reliable segmentation of the conducting phloem area (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). According to preliminary results, the cell walls between sieve elements appear thinner than previously indicated by home-lab x-ray microtomography, yielding higher values for the volume fraction of sieve cell lumina (ca. 60% vs. 40%). The results also confirm critical point drying as a relatively gentle sample preparation method: nuclei and other cell organelles are also seen preserved inside parenchyma (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). On the other hand, the good visiblility of nuclei and nutrient contents inside parenchyma cells also provides a challenge for data segmentation: parenchyma are not trivially separated from the cell walls, which have a similar grayvalue in the reconstruction. With further analysis, this could at least in part be solved by incorporating information from the regular absorption reconstructions from the same scans, in which the contents of parenchyma cells are much less clearly visible (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Helsinki, Department of Physics 2 Finnish Forest Research Institute</figDesc></figure>
