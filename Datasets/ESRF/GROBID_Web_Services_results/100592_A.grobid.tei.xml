<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Introduction</head><p>Novel epitaxial structures of gallium nitride (GaN) are grown on top of GaN/AlN/Si/SiO2 nano-pillars for optoelectronic applications such as microLEDs. The nanopillars are intended to allow the independent GaN nanostructures to coalesce into a highly-oriented film thanks to the SiO2 section becoming soft at GaN growth temperature. The nano-pillars as well as fully coalesced GaN platelets are presented in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (a) and (b). The objectives were to measure the variation of tilt and twist in both the GaN layers and silicon (Si) nano-pillars before and after coalescence and for different pillar to pillar distances (pitch).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed</head><p>To measure the lattice tilt in the Si planes, ω-scans of symmetric (111) reflections were performed as well as (331) reflections. To measure the twist in the Si planes caused by edge dislocations, the asymmetric (331) reflection was measured and the sample rotated around its normal axis Φ. For the GaN layers, we performed scans on the skew-symmetric (204) Bragg reflection to analyse the tilt and twist in the GaN crystallites. The incident beam arriving on the sample covered an area of two coalesced GaN structures each 40x40 µm 2 and these measurements were performed on a reference sample that has only nanopillars, i.e. prior to the pyramids growth, and on two coalesced 40x40 µm 2 GaN structures of pitch p=0.5µm and p=1µm respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>Our growth approach assumes a self-alignment of GaN layers during coalescence, which would cause a disorientation of the Si ( <ref type="formula">111</ref>     In addition, figure 3 (b) shows the distribution of the intensity as function of ω for a given Φ value, and we can see the presence of more than 1 peak at different values of ω e.g. for pitch =0.5µm, we identify a peak at ω= 88.8° and at ω = 89.5°. This also implies that we are observing aligned clusters. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>(c) shows similar results for the structures coalesced pitch of 1 µm. These results are very beneficial to understand our growth approach and present an indirect proof of the selforientation of the GaN pyramids during the coalescence. These findings along with others from the Dark Field X-ray microscopy measurements are the subject of an article, which has been submitted for publication in the journal of applied crystallography. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>) nano-pillars. The results of the asymmetrical Bragg reflection Si (331) and the symmetrical Bragg reflection Si (111) measurements for reference sample A and coalesced sample B are presented in table 1 (a) and (b) respectively.</figDesc></figure>

It is likely that the initial value of FWHM is strongly linked to instrumental resolution and the crystallite size and shape. The (111) reflection also shows an increase in FWHM from 0.32° for sample A to 0.81° for sample B for a pitch of 0.5µm and from 0.25° for sample A to 0.71° for sample B for a pitch of 1µm. The broadening of the two types of planes implies that the silicon layers are more twisted and tilted in the coalesced structures compared to the reference sample, as expected from our model. It is interesting to also note that by measuring the GaN (204) reflection, we obtained values FHWM around 0.6° in the GaN layers of the coalesced structure. This relatively high value can be explained by the fact that with this technique we are scanning across two structures and not just one, thus the results presented correspond to clusters across two structures. Figure3(a) shows the diffraction pattern from the 2D detector, with the y-axis corresponding to values of 2θ, and the x-axis corresponding to Φ. This image is from the GaN (204) Bragg reflection in the middle of a GaN platelet coalesced from pillars having a 0.5 µm pitch. We can clearly see that for a given value of θ and ω we have peaks at different values of Φ, as shown by the red arrows. This implies that we are diffracting zones or clusters of GaN with different values of twist.</figDesc></figure>
