<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this beamtime, we applied wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXS) to study the influence of the electrolyte, in particular the presence of Na+ and Cl-, which simulate seawater condition, to the NiFe LDH reversible structure transformation under operating conditions and correlate the observed changes to degradation mechanisms and to the electrochemical behaviour. We expected an improved signal on supported material. For this we prepared on Vulcan XC72R supported and unsupported NiFe-LDH materials. The as prepared NiFe-LDH has a layered structure with water and carbonate anions in the interlayer region. High OER potentials lead to a phase transformation to a γ-Ni(Fe)OOH phase, which is characterized by a smaller interlayer distance, absence of intercalated anions and possible incorporation of cations. The intercalated carbonate anions are expected to be expelled during the transition and the presence of Na+ and Cl-might interfere in this process. For example, Cl-can be inserted in the interlayer during potential cycling, which will cause a slight expansion of the interlayer distance that would be detected by WAXS. Differences in the cyclic voltammetry in alkaline seawater were reported that could indicate this process <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we show the WAXS pattern for supported and unsupported material after background subtraction. The (003) Peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>),which correlates to the interlayer distance of the NiFe-LDH, shows the expected shift to smaller distances from resting state to OER potentials for both catalyst materials. However, the shift for the unsupported material is slightly smaller. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, the change of the signal is more pronounced for the supported material. The new reflection at ~ 1.4 Å is believed to be the shifted peak of the (110) peak, which is indicated with (110*). The decrease of the ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">113</ref>) peak and the increase of the new (110*) peak is more present for the supported material. Consequently, the unsupported material seems to be more inert than the supported catalyst material. Thus, the unsupported material is on the one hand less influenced by the applied potential and on the other hand shows a bigger interlayer distance for the active phase closer to the resting state (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). This confirmed our assumption that a better signal can be achieved with the supported catalyst material. Hence, we decided to perform the remaining measurements with supported catalyst material.  <ref type="formula">110</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">113</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">1013</ref>) peaks and (b) the (003) peak</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, we show the (003) Peak under OER potentials for the supported NiFe-LDH measured in the remaining electrolyte compositions of 0.1 M KOH, 0.5 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH with and without 0.5 M NaCl. The evaluation of this data is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, where the interlayer distance is plotted against the KOH concentration. In the resting state no significant difference is detected. Contrary, at OER potentials a relation of KOH concentration and interlayer distance of the active phase is determined for NaCl containing as well as for NaCl free electrolyte. However, in the NaCl containing electrolyte the difference is much more pronounced. In fact, at low KOH concentration (0.1 M KOH) the distance of NiFe-LDH in the NaCl containing electrolyte is almost similar to the "inert" unsupported distance. With increasing KOH concentration the interlayer distances in NaCl free and NaCl containing electrolyte converge, while the overall distance decreases. We explain this with the intercalation of excess Cl-at low OH-concentrations and consequent minimization of OH-ions within the catalyst layer. With increasing OH-concentration the presence of Cl-ions can be compensated. While in an electrolyte of 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M NaCl the presence of Cl-still results in an increased interlayer distance, at 1 M KOH the difference between NaCl free and NaCl containing electrolyte almost disappeared. As a conclusion, a double concentration of OH-Ions is able to compensates the Cl-effect to the NiFe-LDH phase at OER potentials entirely. In particular, Cl-Ions only effect the phase structure of the active phase under OER potentials under a specific concentration. In conclusion, in-operando WAXS revealed to be a powerful technique to monitor structural transformations and differences at different pH and the presence of other ions leading to the OER active phase of NiFe-LDH electrocatalysts. Our hypothesis expressed in the proposal application could be fully proofed. This results will give new insights about the NiFe-LDH catalyst system and provide more insight in the mechanism behind structural transformation of NiFe-LDH and in particular to the role of participating anions and cations in the electrolyte. The anion role is a very important parameter to be considered for the oxygen evolution seawater catalyst development. <ref type="bibr">1.
