<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig.2: Schematic of a 4x4 Co-island on Cu(001). This situation can be described in a first approximation by a static disorder of the Coatoms where the Cu-hollow site is the equilibrium adsorption position. To test this model we prepared small Co-islands and measured crystal runcation rods (CTR's) yielding information on the registry of the adsorbate atoms. As an example, Fig. (3) shows experimental (points) and calculated (lines) structure factor amplitudes for 0.3 ML Co/Cu(001) measured at T=150K. At this temperature island growth by diffusion and intermixing is inhibited. STM experiments indcated an island diameter of about 1 nm. In general, for the Co-atoms huge B's in the range between 1.7 and 3.2 Å 2 are obtained, the latter corresponding to [&lt;u 2 &gt;] 1/2 0.2 Å In summary, the SXRD experiments have provided first experimental evidence for the mesoscopic misfit in small Co islands on Cu(001).

Kirschner, PRB 62, 15398 (2000) In order to obtain meaningful results of the disorder analysis, highly accurate data need to be collected. The beamline ID03 with its improved optics supplying an approximately fivefold increased flux was ideally suited for this purpose. Preliminary results are summarized in Figure 4. The filled circles represent the (static) Debye parameters (B=8 2 &lt;u 2 &gt;) derived from the fit of the CTR data for several Co-depositions. These values are in good agreement with simulated data based on 4x4-atom islands (triangles) and much larger than the contribution of the thermal disorder, which at T=150K equals to 0.34 Å 2 (dashed line). The validity of the analysis is also supported by the study of the uncovered Cu(001) sample (=0; solid square), where for the top Cu-layer a twofold enhanced (thermal) B-factor ( 0.7 Å 2 ) over the bulk value is derived.
