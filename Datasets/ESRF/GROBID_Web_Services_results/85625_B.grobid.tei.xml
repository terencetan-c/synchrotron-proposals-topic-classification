<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In situ characterisation of additive manufactured AlSi10Mg post-processed via FSP</p><p>Experiment number: MA3758 Beamline: ID11 Date of experiment: from: 13/9/17 to: 18/9/17 Date of report: 7/9/20 Shifts: 15 Local contact(s): Wolfgang Ludwig Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Juan Guillermo Santos Macías* Université catholique de Louvain Eric Maire* INSA Lyon Jérôme Adrien* INSA Lyon Pascal Jacques Université catholique de Louvain Aude Simar* Université catholique de Louvain Report:</p><p>Additive manufacturing is an increasingly popular technique thanks to the design freedom it offers, coupled with the time and material saving potential. Applications of metal AM already exist in highly competitive industries, such as aerospace. However, the use of metal AM for structural purposes is still to become a reality. The AM parts present features that are currently directly related to the manufacturing process and render them unattractive when aiming for outstanding mechanical performance. Porosity, heterogeneity or residual stress are examples of these specific traits that lead to underperformance in mechanical behaviour, specially in fatigue resistance.</p><p>Friction stir processing could be used as a postreatment technique to bring a solution to these issues. Derived from friction stir welding, this method consists of using a non-consummable rotating cylindrical tool comprised of a shoulder and a pin that is introduced and traverses the material to treat, producing a surface local thermomechanical effect. It has been proven on cast material that the porosity reduction, microstructural refinement and homogeneisation FSP brings translates in an improvement of mechanical performance, particularly ductility and fatigue resistance.</p><p>In order to get a profound understanding of the changes brought about by FSP on a typical AM material, insitu tensile and ex situ fatigue (f=20 Hz, R=0.2, Fmin=25 N, Fmax=125 N) tests were performed on the ESRF ID11 beamline at 0.75 µm resolution. These experiments help in the understanding of the damage mechanisms involved and their modification after FSP.</p><p>The samples were machined from plates manufactured through selective laser melting (SLM) or casting, the latter serving as reference. Several conditions were tested (see The obtained tomography images offer information on the following microstructural features: Initial porosity, Si-rich eutectic particles, Fe-rich impurities, cavities originating with the progressively applied load. This information allows for determination of porosity evolution, nucleation, growth and coalescence of cavities, particle tracking, etc. These different features can be observed on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Since the microstructure of cast samples is coarser, it can be easily appreciated on a 2D slice of the tomography volume. On the other hand, porosity is readily detected on the SLM 35°C AB samples, but the Si-rich eutectic is too fine to be seen. After 6 passes of FSP, porosity is virtually eliminated (at least at the tomography resolution level), while the Si-rich eutectic has experienced globularisation and is now observable.</p><p>On figure 2 the initial porosity on the central part of the SLM 35°C AB and SLM 35°C FSP 1 pass in situ tensile samples can be observed. The initial porosity volume decreases from 0.15% to 0.024% after 1 pass of FSP. Furthermore, the largest pores, which are more critical for mechanical behaviour, are eliminated. The negative influence of Fe-rich impurities on mechanical behaviour and the effect of clustering can be appreciated on figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. After 1 pass of FSP on the SLM material the porosity has been greatly reduced while keeping the microstructure fineness. However, more FSP passes (or variations in other FSP parameters) are needed to complete the breakdown and redistribution of Fe-rich impurities. Further tuning of FSP parameters is needed to reach an equilibrium between excessive globularisation of the microstructure and insufficient dispersion and refinement of Fe-rich particles.</p><p>The ex situ fatigue tests also yield very interesting results. 11 tomography images were obtained on the SLM 35°C SRHT fatigue sample, the first before loading (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> left) and the rest after a certain amount of cycles during the test. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> centre and right respectively depict the Z-projection of the 6 th and 10 th tomography volumes. Thanks to this test, the origin of the main fatigue crack could be linked to the presence of a critical pore close to the surface.</p><p>The observation of all the phenomena occurring on these tests allows to reach a profound understanding of the damage mechanism nature and its alteration through the thermomechanical effect of the FSP technique. This in turn leads to the possibility of optimising and tayloring the process.

Friction stir processing (FSP) is a promising post-treatment solution to tackle this issue. FSP of selective laser melted AlSi10Mg leads to the globularisation of the Sirich eutectic network, microstructural homogenisation and porosity reduction. These features have been characterised using in and ex situ mechanical testing and different imaging techniques. A significant modification of the damage mechanism is reported with an increase of the fracture strain from 0.1 to 0.4 after FSP and an enhancement over two orders of magnitude in fatigue life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: As cast (left), SLM 35°C AB (centre) and SLM 35°C FSP 6 passes (right) samples</figDesc><graphic coords="4,303.35,198.35,255.95,236.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
