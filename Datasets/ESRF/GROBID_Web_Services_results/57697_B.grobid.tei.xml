<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Introduction. With this visit we started an investigation on the structural basis of the Frank-Starling law of the heart, the mechanism that allows the force during the contraction (systole) to be adapted to the volume attained by the ventricle at the end of the relaxation (end-diastolic volume). At the level of the sarcomere (the structural unit of heart muscle cell in which myosin motors work cooperatively, generating steady force and shortening by cyclic ATP-driven interactions with the interdigitating actin filaments) the Frank-Starling law consists in the so called length-dependent activation (LDA), that is the increase in the force of contraction with the increase in sarcomere length (SL). A crucial prerequisite of this research is therefore to record and control the SL changes underlying the modulation of the mechanical performance and the related structural dynamics of motor and cytoskeletal proteins. For this fast sarcomere mechanics in intact trabeculae is combined with X-ray diffraction from synchrotron light, to achieve the mechanical and structural resolution adequate to define the function of the motor protein, while preserving the control of the sarcomere. This is possible due to the recent upgrade of the high brilliance beamline ID02 of the European Synchrotron (ESRF, Grenoble, France), which makes this beamline unique worldwide for the possibility to vary the sample-to-detector distance from 0.6 to 30 m, so that the nanometer-scale signals originating from the two arrays of myosin motors in each thick filament and from the double hexagonal lattice formed by the myosin and actin filaments can be recorded together with the micrometer-scale changes in the length of the sarcomeres interrogated by the X-ray beam. Methods. The trabecula was vertically mounted in a thermoregulated trough (27°C), perfused with oxygenated physiological solution, and electrically paced at a frequency of 0.5Hz. A FReLoN CCD detector was placed at either 1.6 m from the preparation to collect up to the 6th order of the myosinbased meridional reflections, or 30 m to measure sarcomere length (SL) during diastole-systole cycles (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). SL was held constant during force development (sarcomere isometric conditions) by feeding the motor-servo system with a signal based on the changes in SL recorded in the preceding fixed-end contraction <ref type="bibr">(Caremani et al., PNAS, 113:3675-3680, 2016)</ref>. Results. In diastole the spacings of the M3 meridional reflection (SM3, associated with the myosin heads axial periodicity) and of its second order M6 (SM6, associated with the myosin-containing thick filament backbone periodicity) are 14.361  0.004 (mean  SD) and 7.195 nm respectively (SL 2.25 µm and [Ca 2+ ] o 2.5 mM, four trabeculae). At the maximum of systolic force attained with [Ca 2+ ] o 2.5 mM and SL 2.1 µm both SM3 and SM6 were 1% larger. The M3 reflection was sampled by X-ray interference between half-sarcomeres, showing a dominant peak with two small satellites on either side in diastole, while at the maximum of systolic force in sarcomere isometric conditions it was split in two peaks of comparable size. These results indicate that in diastole myosin heads are folded back towards the thick filament midpoint in agreement with the OFF state of the filament in skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr">(Zoghbi et al., PNAS, 105, 2386</ref><ref type="bibr">-2390</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Linari et al., Nature, 228, 576-579, 2015)</ref>. Consistent with the transition to the ON state described in the skeletal muscle thick filament, the development of systolic force is associated with the 1% increase of thick filament extension and the movement of the myosin heads by ca 10 nm away from the filament midpoint <ref type="bibr">(Reconditi et al., PNAS, 108, 7236-7240, 2011)</ref>. A paper is in preparation to report the first in situ description of the cardiac myosin dynamics during systole-diastole cycle. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
