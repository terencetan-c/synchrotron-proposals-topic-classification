<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report of Experiment MX608 at ID14-1 on 27 th February 2008</p><p>The beamline worked properly during most of the shifts assigned to our group. We used the sample changer, without major problems, though sometimes an error about "not properly vial fitting" appeared. It was probably due to presence of ice in the sample changer because we used only Hampton research HP cap and vials. The assistance of our local contact, Dr. Juan Sanchez-Weatherby, who was precious and present, was very helpful. We used DNA both for testing and data collection, but in a few cases we collected the data manually and processed the frames using mosflm, since DNA failed in finding the cell. The beam intensity was fine during the whole beamtime as well as the detector and all the software of the network. We tested 60 crystals and performed 7 data collections of crystals belonging to 4 different projects.</p><p>1) Project on a human Glutathione Transferase from Pi class in complex with antitumoral compound NBDHEX. We collected three data sets with the following statistics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Co-crystallization -GTPi -ID14-1</formula><p>Space group C2 Unit cell dimensions 77.423 89.349 68.914 90.000 97.901 90.000 Overall InnerShell Low resolution limit 30.0 -High resolution limit 1.9 1.97 R merge 0.050 0.159 Multiplicity 4.7 -Mean((I)/sd(I)) 20.49 11.01 Completeness 99.8 98.8 Chi square 1.086 1.483 Soak 1 -GTPi -ID14-1 Space group C2 Unit cell dimensions 78.361 89.446 69.134 90.000 98.245 90.000 Overall InnerShell OuterShell Low resolution limit 30.0 48.51 2.95 High resolution limit 1.5 1.55 1.50 R merge 0.092 0.123 -Multiplicity 4.3 --Mean((I)/sd(I)) 21.7 13.43 -Completeness 98.1 82.4 -Chi square 0.99 1.653 -Soak 2 -GTPi -ID14-1 Space group C2 Unit cell dimensions 78.587 89.347 69.264 90.000 98.355 90.000 Overall InnerShell OuterShell Low resolution limit 30.0 48.51 2.95 High resolution limit 1.55 1.61 1.55 R merge 0.053 0.26 -Multiplicity 2.6 --Mean((I)/sd(I)) 9.49 5.06 -Completeness 98.1 82.4 -Chi square 1.39 1.642 -2) Project on Serine hydroxymethyl transferase from Methanococcus jannaschii, a divergent SHMT seemingly binding RNA. We collected data on two crystals, one native and the other obtained co-crystallizing with glycine. The structures, using the high diffraction dataset, have been solved by MR using the program phaser. The structures are currently under manual building, but improvement of crystal quality is a work in progress. native dataset: space group P212121 cell 86.593 110.154 110.714 resolution 30.0-3.4 Å completeness 98% I/sigma 9.49 Redundancy 3.2 Rmerge 0.083</p><p>3) Leishmania mayor Trypanothione reductase, a key enzyme in the trypanothione-based redox metabolism of pathogenic trypanosomes. We collected one data set of the native recombinant enzyme. We tested some heavy metal soaks but they diffracted at 7.0 Å. Both co-crystallization trial and other soaks with some inhibitors are in progress.</p><p>native -Tr1 -ID14-1 Space group P4 Unit cell dimensions 103.391 103.391 191.832 90 90 90 Overall InnerShell Low resolution limit 30.0 48.51 High resolution limit 2.8 1.55 R merge 0.096 0.626 Multiplicity 3.8 3.5 Mean((I)/sd(I)) 10.2 8.9 Completeness 99.1 98.0 4) Adult worm Schistosoma mansoni Trx is a project from the structural genomics of this pernicious human parasite. We had already solved the structure of the isoform expressed by the larval stage, and now we focussed on the adult isoform. We collected 1 data set at 1.6Å from the only crystal coming from a large robotized screening. MR was performed with MolRep using the larval protein as a search model and model building and refinement are under progress.
