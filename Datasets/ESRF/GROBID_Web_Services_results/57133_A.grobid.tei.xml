The samples, when needed depending on composition, were diluted in order to optimize the absorption edge and the total absorption at each edge considered. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the 15 EXAFS shifts granted on BM01B we needed to acquire at least 15 scans for each edge and composition in order to reach a suitable signal to noise ratio also at high k values, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Please note that k values as high as 17 Å -1 are requested to resolve cation-anion and cation-cation interatomic distances which differ of about 0.09 Å. Therefore we were able to measure all the single-doped compositions, two double-doped samples and the standard oxides at the above cited edges for a total of 27 samples. In this way we successfully separated different subshells, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.  The Debye-Waller  2 (Å 2 ) factors of the single-doped compounds (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) increase as a function of doping, except for the Y-edge where they decrease. Taking into account the interesting results obtained, it would be essential for us to have the possibility to complete our EXAFS experiment by measuring the full compositional range of the double-doped samples. We will submit a continuation proposal in order to complete the full series of compositions (other 23 samples).</p><p>XRPD measurements have been collected at 90 K using wavelenghts of λ=0.326346(5) Å in the high Q-resolution setup (array of 9 point detectors) and λ=0.17712(1) Å using the 2 dimensional detector. High quality patterns have been collected on all the samples and the data are at present under analysis, since the experiment has been carried out at the end of February. In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>   In conclusion, we have successfully performed EXAFS and diffraction experiments and verified the suitability of the beamlines to reach the goals of the proposal. As to the diffraction part, all the samples have been measured and high quality PDF have been obtained. Data are at present under analysis. As to the EXAFS part, the time necessary to collect data of the desidered quality at sufficient high k values, was more than expected and only about half of the samples have been measured during the 15 shifts of the experiment. We stress that k values as high as 17 Å -1 are needed to resolve interatomic distances which differ of less than 0.0.09 Å. Additional measuring time (about 15 shifts more) is needed for the EXAFS part at BM01B (now BM31).</p></div>			</div>
