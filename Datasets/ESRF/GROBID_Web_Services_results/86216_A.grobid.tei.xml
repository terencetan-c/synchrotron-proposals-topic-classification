<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Using Cryostream 700+ nitrogen blower device, the XRD experiments (λ = 0.71075 Å) were carried out with powder and single crystal samples at the 80 -400 K temperature range. The following diffraction data collections have been saved for our analysis.</p></div>

A newly prepared flake-like phase with the EDPbI 4 (NH 3 CH 2 CH 2 NH 3 ) composition. a. Single crystal data collections at T = 100, 110, 134 and 300 K. b. Powder diffraction data collection at 100 and 300 K II. MAPbI 3 . Study of cyclic phase transformations around the phase transitions temperatures. a. Study around T = 330 K, the tetragonal -cubic phase transition. 6000 powder XRD patterns were taken during five cycles of 310 -350 -310 K. Two samples were measured. b. Study around T = 161 K, the tetragonal -orthorhombic phase transition. 3402 powder XRD patterns were taken during five cycles of 140 -180 -140 K for one sample. III. Study of growth dynamics of MAPbI 3 , MAPbBr 3 , MAPbCl 3 from three different past-like solutions. a. Growth MAPbI 3 from DMA at 273 K. 380 powder XRD patterns were taken. b. Growth MAPbI 3 from DMA with heating from 273 to 313 K. 69 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. c. Growth MAPbI 3 from DMF with and without heating. 999 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. d. Growth MAPbI 3 from DMSO with and without heating. 999 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. e. Growth MAPbBr 3 from DMA with and without heating. 201 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. f. Growth MAPbBr 3 from DMF with and without heating. 55 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. g. Growth MAPbBr 3 from DMSO with and without heating. 787 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. h. Growth MAPbCl 3 from DMA with and without heating. 216 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. a. Growth MAPbCl 3 from DMF with and without heating. 120 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples. a. Growth MAPbCl 3 from DMSO with and without heating. 93 powder XRD patterns were taken for each of two samples.</figDesc></figure>
