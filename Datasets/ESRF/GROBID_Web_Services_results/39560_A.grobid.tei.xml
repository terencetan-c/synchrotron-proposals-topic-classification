<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ZnCl 2 + 3LiBH 4 Sample from Geneva, prepared by ball milling, temperature ramp 100-500 K. The measurement has completed the data measured in July 2008 within the project no. 01-02-805. Two new compounds are structurally characterized: LiZn(BH 4 ) 3 and NaZn(BH 4 ) 3 . The results are being prepared for publication.</p><p>xZnCl 2 + yKBH 4 , x:y = 1:2 and 3:8 Sample from Geneva, prepared by ball milling, temperature ramp 100-500 K. The data are being processed for the structure solution of expected Zn(BH 4 ) 2 and K 2 Zn 3 (BH 4 ) 8 .</p><p>xMnCl 2 + yLiBH 4 , x:y = 1:2 and 1:3 MnCl 2 + 3KBH 4 Sample from Geneva, prepared by ball milling, temperature ramp 100-500 K. The sample with LiBH 4 has allowed the structural characterization of the first transition metal borohydride Mn(BH 4 ) 2 . The data measured on the sample with KBH 4 shows powder patterns of another new phase and are currently being treated.</p><p>Mn(BH 4 ) 2 Solvent-free homoleptic manganese borohydride Mn(BH 4 ) 2 forms at ambient conditions in ball-milled mixtures of alkali metal borohydrides and MnCl 2 . It crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system with the space group symmetry P3 1 12 and is stable from 90 up to 450 K, where the compound melts. The structure of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 shows interesting similarity to α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 : the two structures are made of similar layers L with the composition M 4 (BH 4 ) 10 per cell (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The layers are stacked along the c-axis, and rotated by 120° by the 3 1 axis in Mn(BH 4 ) 2 and by 60° by the 6 1 axis in α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . Three identical layers are stacked along one unit cell vector c in Mn(BH 4 ) 2 , six layers are stacked in α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . In Mn(BH 4 ) 2 the layers L are connected directly, and share atoms. In α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 the layers L are intercalated by a thin layer L' which contains one Mg atom per layer per cell. The layer L is chiral, and both borohydrides crystallize in chiral space groups. Similar to α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , the structure of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 is not densely packed and contains isolated voids with the estimated volume of 21 Å 3 each, which occupy in total 6% of the space. The resemblance between Mn(BH 4 ) 2 and α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 is also reflected in their Raman and infrared spectra.</p><p>Figure 1. Crystal structure of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 (left) and α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 (right) made from the similar layers L (top). The layers contain two independent M atoms (blue and violet). The layer of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 is shown here as a mirror image of the layer of α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . The layers are stacked along the c-axis (bottom), and rotated by 120° by the 3 1 axis in Mn(BH 4 ) 2 and by 60° by the 6 1 axis in α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . In Mn(BH 4 ) 2 , the layers L (light blue) are overlapping, sharing atoms. In α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , the layers L (light blue) are intercalated by a thin layer L' (yellow) containing the third independent Mg atom (green).</p><p>The results are submitted for publication <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>[1] Černý R., <ref type="bibr">Penin N., Hagemann H., Filinchuk Ya.
