One of these was used in the published article but all were useful in preliminary analyses. Abstract:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The specificity of ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) towards their four substrates is governed by binding of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to the allosteric specificity site. Similar patterns in the kinetics of allosteric regulation have been a strong argument for a common evolutionary origin for the three otherwise widely divergent RNR classes. Recent structural information settled the case for divergent currently poorly understood. A comparative study of the conformational effects of binding of different effectors has not yet been possible; in addition only one RNR class has been studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We present structures of a class III, anaerobic RNR in complex with four dNTPs, allowing a full comparison of the protein conformations. Discrimination between the effectors is achieved by two side chains, Gln 114 and Glu 181, from separate monomers. Large conformational changes in the active site (loop 2), in particular Phe 194, are induced by effector binding. The overall differences are larger when comparing purine and pyrimidine effectors than when comparing purines or pyrimidines with each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The subtle differences in base size and hydrogen bonding pattern at the effector site are communicated to major conformational changes in the active site. We propose that the altered overlap of Phe 194 with the substrate base governs hydrogen bonding patterns with main-and side-chain hydrogen bonding groups in the active site. The relevance for evolution is discussed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>-</head><figDesc>1st March for experiments carried out up until June of the previous year; -1st September for experiments carried out up until January of the same year.</figDesc></figure>
