<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment is a continuation of experiment 0801-1015. Our aim was to apply X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the K-edge of selenium 1) to characterize the evolution of selenium speciation and putative metabolic intermediates during the transformation of selenite (SeO 3 2-, oxidation state 4 + ) into elemental selenium by the bacterial strain Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SeITE02, by collecting samples at increasing incubation times after exposure to Na 2 SeO 3 at 0.5 mM concentration; and 2) to characterize the short range order of Se 0 in the biogenic nano-particles (SeNPs) produced during this transformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Details:</head><p>Unlike our previous 0801-1015 run, most of the measured samples were grown, incubated and extracted at ESRF thanks to the EMBL Laboratory support.</p><p>XANES measurements were performed at room temperature at the Se K-edge in fluorescence mode: a) on dry bacterial cells deposited on millipore filters, after addition of selenite Na 2 SeO 3 at 0.5 mM concentration after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hrs incubation time; b) on bacterial cells as liquid suspensions, after addition of selenite at 0.5 mM concentration after 6, 12, 16, 20, 24 hrs incubation time; c) on the cytoplasm proteic fractions -extracted from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SeITe02 grown for 24 hrs in nutrient broth -as liquid suspension, after addition of selenite at 0.5 mM after 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hrs reaction time; d) on the cytoplasm -purified from the bacterial cells grown with selenite at 0.5 mM after 0, 3, 6 and 12 hrs incubation time -as liquid suspension; e) on selected Selenium standards: home-prepared elemental red Selenium, elemental grey Selenium, sodium-selenite Na 2 SeO 3 , and seleno-L-cysteine (oxidation state 2+), either on millipore filters or as liquid samples. EXAFS measurements were performed at room temperature (and, for a subset, also at 77 K) either in transmission or in fluorescence mode: a) on biogenic SeNPs extracted through sonication from the bacterial cells after addition of selenite at 0.5 mM concentration at 6, 24 and 48 hrs incubation time (deposited on millipore filters); b) as for the previous set, on biogenic Se-nanoparticles extracted without sonication after 24 and 48 hrs; c) on chemical SeNPs, synthesized through cysteine reaction with Na 2 SeO 3 ; d) on selected selenium standards: home-prepared red elemental Selenium, grey elemental Selenium, sodiumselenite Na 2 SeO 3 and seleno-L-Cysteine, either on millipore filters or as liquid samples.</p><p>In most cases two or more measurements were performed for each sample, in particular for fluorescence detection. The S/N ratio for XANES was good on both type of samples (filters and liquid cells). EXAFS measurements were characterized by some noise and irreproducibilities due to the instability of the old BM08-Lisa monochromator. Absolute energy scale of the spectra was set by comparison with the Se edge which was simultaneously measured at each time on a metallic selenium foil placed after the samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Results:</head><p>Preliminary data processing and analysis were performed using the ATHENA Data Processing software (<ref type="url" target="https://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/">https://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/</ref>) after alignment of the XAS spectra.</p><p>We found that inside the bacterial cells (millipore filters samples) intermediate oxidation states between selenite (4+) and elemental selenium (0) are present in the very early stages of incubation and that already after 0.5 hour elemental selenium neatly prevails (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, left side); while in the suspension at least up to 12/16 hours of incubation the main component is selenite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, right side), thus indicating that the original selenite content has not been fully reduced. The expected role of the cytoplasm in selenite reduction was confirmed. Moreover, we found that the process is slower in the extracted proteic fraction than in the cytoplasm inside the cell. The reduction of selenite by the proteic fraction occurs between 12 and 24 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, right side), while it appears earlier, between 6 and 12 hours, and is completed after 12 hours, in the cytoplasm purified from the bacterial cells grown with selenite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, left side), suggesting that different mechanisms of selenite reduction could be involved inside the cells. As regards SeNPs, the absorption edge resulted to be always that of red selenium, independently from the sonication process, indicating that the transition to the grey form seen in the previous experiment is due to the spontaneous transition of Se to the more stable grey form. Moreover, EXAFS measurements at liquid nitrogen temperature on the home-prepared red selenium and on the SeNPS show that there is no long range order in red selenium in any sample, hence suggesting that red selenium is always in the amorphous form.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
