<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>Cell therapy holds promise for treatment of ischemic stroke in the chronic phase. To foster translation into the clinic, there is a need for non-invasive techniques that enable long-term follow-up of cell fate. Our purpose is to provide proof of concept of specific and quantitative in vivo imaging of therapeutic cells by an innovative, translational technique: K-edge imaging by spectral photon counting computed tomography (SPCCT). Kedge imaging with Synchrotron-produced x-rays (SXR) will serve us as a gold standard for validation of the recently developped SPCCT approach (project supported by a H2020 grant in which we are partners, <ref type="url" target="http://www.spcct.eu/">http://www.spcct.eu/</ref>).</p><p>Materials &amp; Methods: M2-polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages were labelled with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 0.1 mg/mL, 15 h) and gold/cell quantified by mass spectroscopy. Gold-labelled cells were intracerebrally (IC) delivered within PBS (n=6) or a hydrogel (n=9) in a rat model of neuroinflammation, induced by IC injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) two weeks before treatment delivery. Other animals were injected with of AuNPs solution alone (n=1), suspended in PBS (N=1), or suspended in hydrogel (N=1). Control animals of this study included IC injection of unlabelled cell suspended in hydrogel (n=1), unlabelled cells alone (n=1), hydrogel alone (n=1), PBS (n=1), LPS injection only (n=1) and sham injection (n=1). Animals were scanned in vivo by SPCCT between the same day or the day after injection and then euthanized, and their heads prepared to be scanned ex-vivo by SXR. A subgroup of animals (i.e. gold-labelled cells in hydrogel, n=3; gold-labelled cells in PBS, n=4) were followed up in vivo 5 to 6 days post-injection by SPCCT and 9 to 10 days post-injection by SXR. A phantom with a concentration range of AuNPs (0 to 8 mg/mL) was scanned for calibration of quantification with both techniques. For SPCCT acquisitions, anode tube voltage of 120 kVp and current of 100 mA were used. For SXR acquisitions, the imaging set-up at ID17 consisted of the fixed-exit monochromator coupled with the frelon camera (45 μm spatial resolution, for ex-vivo samples) or the PCOedge camera (21 μm spatial resolution, for in vivo imaging). To perform K-edge imaging of gold with SXR, an absorption image is first acquired just below the binding energy of the K shell electrons (79.7 keV) and then just above the binding energy of the electrons (81.7 keV). The subtraction of these two acquisitions produces a specific image of the element. Gold K-edge images were reconstructed and gold signal was manually delineated for quantification.</p><p>Results: K-edge imaging of gold with SPCCT specifically detected gold-labelled cells within the brain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Mass spectroscopy detected an amount of 165 gold pg/cell, corresponding to 82.5 μg of gold injected within cells. The measured concentrations in phantom linearly correlated with the known concentrations (R 2 = 0.99, slope: 0.82, intercept: 0.19), supporting the potential for accurate gold-cell quantification. In agreement, goldlabelled cells were also specifically detected by SXR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The analysis of signals volumes and contrast agents concentration for these imaging techniques are ongoing, and will be compared to the contrast agents quantification on tissue brains samples by mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Conclusions &amp; Perspectives: Our initial results provide proof-of-concept for non-invasive in vivo imaging of gold-labelled therapeutic cells by SPCCT, which has the advantage of being specific and quantitative. In vivo k-edge imaging of goldlabelled cells was also successfully performed with SXR for the first time to the best of our knowledge. SPCCT may be valuable to evaluate cell therapy in chronic stroke patients.</p></div>
