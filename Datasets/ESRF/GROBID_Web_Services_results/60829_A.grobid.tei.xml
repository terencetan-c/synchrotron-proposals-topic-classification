<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>At ID27 we conducted a high pressure X-Ray study of 1T-TaSe2 at room and low temperatures. Oriented samples of about 50 μm diameter were loaded in a membrane-driven diamond anvil pressure cell (DAC), mounted in a continuous flow helium cryostat. The data collection was performed using a wavelength of 0.3738 Å and a MARCCD detector. At each pressure point, we collected a data set of 120 images over a sample rotation of 60° with 0.5° scan width per image, with an exposure time of one second. At room temperature (RT) and ambient pressure, 1T-TaSe2 exhibits commensurate (C) charge density wave (CDW) order. Keeping T constant at RT and increasing p, the incommensurate (IC) phase is reached at 4 GPa, by a first order phase transition. The superlattice peaks can be indexed by q1=0.276a*+1/3c* and q2=0.276b*-1/3c*. Above 10.0 GPa, another phase transition to (ICHP1) is observed, in which the superlattice peaks split along the l-direction and change their intensities dramatically. The ICHP1 undergoes a second order like transition to yet another new IC phase (ICHP2) at about 20 GPa, which breaks the sixfold symmetry of the superlattice. The new monoclinic superstructure ICHP2 is found to be compatible with a (3+2)-dimensional superspace group C2/c, Z=2, whereas IC shows a trigonal P-3m1 symmetry, Z=1. The position of the new modulation wave vectors are described by q1=0.277a*-0.277b*-2/7c* and q2=0.277a*+0.277b*+2/7c*, with respect to the monoclinic reciprocal lattice parameters. Reciprocal space maps for the individual ICDW phases are shown in the figure.</p><p>In order to search for further possible changes of the CDW order, we also cooled the sample from RT down to 10 K at 10 GPa, within the IC phase. With deceasing temperature a broadening of the main-reflections and the corresponding superlattice peaks along the l-direction indicating the presence of a disordered stacking along c. Lowering the pressure at 30K does not show any significant change in the broadening of the peaks. 1T-TaSe2 undergoes a phase transition at a pressure of 5.5 GPa and 30K towards a twinned C-CDW order.</p><p>It should be noted that due to technical issues concerning the loading of the DAC we could not measure a single sample over the entire pressure range. Instead, we were forced to measure different samples in the different pressure-temperature regimes, which hampers a clear discrimination between pressure effects and sample quality dependent effects. In addition, these technical issues consumed a significant amount of time and, therefore, we could acquire only one data set at each pressure point where the exposure time and primary beam intensity was chosen such that the superlattice-peaks are well observable but the main-reflections are strongly overexposed. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately and quantitatively extract changes of peak intensities as a function of pressure and temperature.</p><p>In summary, we could successfully identify several new CDW phases as a function of pressure and temperature in 1T-TaSe2 on a qualitative level. Despite technical issues which hamper a quantitative analysis of the data, we could acquire key insides and important experience with respect to future experiments. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure :</head><label>:</label><figDesc>Figure: Reciprocal space maps of the XRD intensity for the various IC-CDW phases observed in 1T-TaSe2.
