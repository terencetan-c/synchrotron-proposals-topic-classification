<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Soft resonant magnetic x-ray scattering experiments were undertaken to study the rotational magnetization processes in transition metal multilayers. The primary objective was to determine whether circularly polarised soft x-ray could be used to determine the relative fractions of ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically coupled material in Co/Cu multilayers. The secondary objective was to study the magnetic viscosity observed in the bilinear antiferromagnetically coupled systems and determine its temperature dependence.</p><p>The Co/Cu samples with Cu thickness correponding to the 1 st antiferromagnetic coupling peak showed a mixture of bilinear and biquadratic antiferromagnetic coupling and negligible ferromagnetic coupling. The biquadratic coupling was seen both by the behaviour of the intensity of the antiferromagnetic Bragg peak in reverse fields and also in the helicity dependence of the antiferromagnetic Bragg peak. The fractional change in the height of this peak on flipping the helicity of the incoming beam provides a measure of the fraction of material coupled in the two configurations.</p><p>No time dependence was observed in biquadratically coupled material or in samples with Cu thickness correponding to the 2 nd a.f. peak. In the bilinearly coupled samples, viscosity was observed in the intensity of the (pure magnetic) a.f. Bragg during a step magnetising sequence in which the field was applied parallel to the easy direction. (Prior to all experiments, a high magnetic field was applied perpendicular to this easy direction, defined by the original growth field direction). As a function of the magnetising field, which was chosen to be perpendicular to the scattering plane, the antiferromagnetic magnetic Bragg peak showed significant and hysteretic changes in amplitude. On application of the magnetizing field, the viscosity was greatest at low fields (Figs <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>). A satisfactory fit to a single exponential was obtained. Very little viscosity was observed in the magnetisation decay at low fields, this becoming more pronounced at higher fields. Equally good fits could be obtained to a single exponential or a logarithmic decay. No systematic trend could be found in the rise or decay rates, the behaviour being irreproducible from one run to the next. No significant temperature dependence was found over the range available.</p><p>The results support our suggestion that the viscosity arises from thermal activation over a collective energy barrier formed in the antiferromagnetically coupled layer system. Lorentz microscopy results have shown that there exists a small canting of the antiferromagnetically coupled moments on adjacent layers leading to a weak ferromagnetic behaviour.</p><p>The energy surface associated with the moment distribution is not reproducible from one magnetisation sequence to the next and thus there is no systematic trend in the time dependence rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>

High field viscosity in Co/Cu</head><p>The rotational magnetisation process in the Co layer of Ta/NiFe/Cu/Co/IrMn/Ta spin valves was studied. From the asymmetry ratio (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) between the intensities of the specular scatter with right-handed and left-handed circularly polarised x-rays tuned to the Co L 3 edge, we were able to reconstruct the magnetisation curve for the Co layer. with the x-ray energy tuned to the Mn L 3 edge</p><p>On tuning the x-ray energy to the Mn L 3 edge, a small change in the specular intensity was detected on reversal of the helicity (fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The magnitude of the change fell on detuning from the Mn edge. The data show that a small ferromagnetic moment is associated with the antiferromagnetic IrMn layer which is grown to pin the ferromagnetic Co layer in the spin valve structure. The origin of this exchange field is in dispute but the most strongly favoured mechanism is that of a layer of uncompensated spins at the antiferromagnet/ferromagnet interface providing the pinning via exchange coupling. Our data provide evidence for the existence of such a layer of uncompensated spins.</p><p>6.05 6.15 2800 3200 3600 4000 Time (secs.)
