<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Lu 5 Ir 4 Si 10 shows the coexistence of superconductivity (T SC ~4K) and a charge density wave (CDW -T CDW ~77K). By applying an external parameter, like pressure <ref type="bibr">[Shelton86]</ref> or doping <ref type="bibr">[Singh05]</ref>, it is possible to reduce T CDW continuously from 77K to 0K (at P=2.1GPa) and increase T SC from 4K to 9K. Lu 5 Ir 4 Si 10 (tetragonal space group) is constituted of 1D chains of first neighbours Lutetium atoms along the c-axis, with a strong interchain coupling. At ambient pressure, Becker &amp; al reported the periodic lattice distortion associated with the CDW manifesting by the formation of x-ray superlattice reflections at wave vectors G+/q CDW where G is a reciprocal lattice vector and q CDW =(0,0, 3/7) [Becker99]. They concluded that the CDW is commensurate with a lattice parameter of 1/7.</p><p>For this experiment, we loaded 3 diamond anvil cells with Helium as pressure transmitting medium. A membrane offers the opportunity to tune the pressure in-situ during the experiment. The pressure was measured before and after each change of temperature or pressure.</p><p>The first pressure cell was used at room temperature and was loaded with a powder of Lu 5 Ir 4 Si 10 . The cell parameters were measured up to 80kBars. A clear kink in the ratio c/3a and in the compressibility is found around 17kbars.  0 20 40 60 80 100 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Lu 5 Ir</p><p>signing the superstructure formed by the charge density wave. At 25K, the destruction of the CDW occurs above 20kbars, in excellent agreement with the phase diagram measured by electrical resistivity [Shelton86]. Typical reconstruction in the 3hl plane is shown in fig.2. Interestingly, at low pressure the superlattice reflections can be indexed with a wave vector of G+n/7c*. However, few extra peaks seem to be visible in fig.3. Note, that this was already observed by Becker &amp; al on single crystals grown by Czocralski techniques. This was attributed to a poor monochromaticity of the xray beam. When the pressure is increased up to approximately around 17kbars, the number of extra peaks increases and the intensities of the peaks at n/7c* decrease strongly. A new periodicity is found with n/20c*. For example the peaks at [3 4 3/7] are thinner under pressure and shift slightly at the wave vector 0.45c*. This result suggests that two commensurate charge density waves compete one with q=c*/7 and the other with q= c*/20.
