<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substancia nigra pars compacta. This phenomenon is still unexplained, even though some metals, and especially redox metals such as Mn and Fe are suspected to play a major role in the etiology of PD. The aim of this experiment was to determine the chemical element mapping of dopaminergic neurons, PC12 cultured cells, at the sub-cellular level when neurons are treated with neurotoxins related to Parkinson's disease, such as manganese. We were especially interested in determining the cellular manganese distribution because at high concentrations manganese has been reported to cause Parkinsonian-like symptoms, known as 'manganism', and this element is also considered like as potential environmental risk factor for PD and its related disorders <ref type="bibr">(Martin, 2006)</ref>. PC12 cells exposed to other neurotoxic compounds were also prepared for this experiment but the analyses focused mainly on manganese exposed cells as the results were very interesting and the analysis time limited.</p><p>In recent experiments at ESRF (experiment reports MD80 and MD178) we performed X-ray fluorescence imaging of chemical elements on PC12 cells with a 90 nm spatial resolution. Nano-chemical imaging indicates that iron accumulates into dopamine vesicles, within the cytosol, neurites, and distal ends of cultured dopaminergic cells <ref type="bibr">(Ortega et al., 2007)</ref>. Micro-XANES experiments revealed that iron was exclusively present as Fe(III) in cells <ref type="bibr">(Bacquart et al., 2007)</ref>. These results suggest that Fe is bound to dopamine in neurosecretory vesicles of normal dopaminergic neurons. Our hypothesis, as well as others <ref type="bibr">(Lashuel et al., 2006)</ref>, is that dopamine-iron complexes may wrongly relocate to the cytosol in PD dopaminergic neurons leading to cell death through redox cycling due to the oxidative stress induced by the highly reactive iron-catechol compounds.</p><p>In this experiment, a setup for high spatial resolution X-ray fluorescence microanalysis based on a Kirkpatrick-Baez lens and a piezo sample stage was used on ID22 beamline, thus leading to the obtention of a pink photon beam at the same time highly spatially resolved (220 nm x 80 nm v x h beam size) and with a high flux of photons (10 11 ph/s). The characteristics of the beam fullfilled the requirements for mapping of biological trace elements (in the µg/g range) at a sub-micrometer scale (size of most intracellular organites). The energy of the incoming X-ray beam was set at 16.8 keV allowing to map all trace elements in cells.</p><p>X-ray fluorescence microanalysis of PC12 cells enabled to define the element distributions in the main cellular compartments : nucleus, cytosol, neurite outgrowths and distal ends. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of analysis: K, Cl and Zn are found in all cellular compartments, with a higher Zn content in the nucleus, whereas Fe is found in small structures in the cytosol confirming the results obtained in previous experiments <ref type="bibr">(Ortega et al., 2007)</ref>. Manganese accumulates in a specific region of cell cytosol, near the nucleus. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, and for about 10 examples more obtained during the experiment (not shown), a similar distribution was observed showing the same peri-nuclear accumulation of manganese.</p><p>The perinuclear localisation of manganese suggests that this element accumulates within the Golgi apparatus and/or the endoplasmic reticulum wich are usually located in one side of the cell, close to the nucleus. This result should now be confirmed by further experiments using PC12 cells labelled with fluorescent markers specific of Golgi apparatus and of the endoplasmic reticulum. If the accumulation of managanese in those compartments is proven it would be of paramount importance to understand the neurotoxicity of manganese. A similar interaction with Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum has been evidenced for alpha synuclein mutant proteins and linked to the pathogenesis of PD <ref type="bibr">(Cooper et al., 2006)</ref>. The alteration of Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum functions would result in a deffective accumulation of dopamine in cells (outside neurovesicles) explaining the specificity of dopaminergic cells neurodegeneration in PD <ref type="bibr">(Lashuel et al., 2006)</ref>.
