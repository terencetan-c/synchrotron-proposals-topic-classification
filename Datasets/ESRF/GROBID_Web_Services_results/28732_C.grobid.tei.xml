<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>How proteins become properly localised within cells is one of the fundamental questions in biology. Protein sorting is the principal process by which order is achieved and maintained in all living cells. A key player in this process is a ribonucleoprotein, the signal recognition particle (SRP), which functions as a molecular adapter coupling protein synthesis and membrane translocation. The signal recognition particle (SRP) is an evolutionary conserved ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that associates with ribosomes to mediate co-translational targeting of secretory proteins to biological membranes.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the SRP consists of a 7S (or SRP) RNA, and six protein components (SRP9/14, SRP19, SRP54 and SRP68/72). SRP can be divided into two structurally and functionally distinct RNP domains: Alu-and S-domain. The S-domain of SRP comprises the 7S.S part of RNA bound to SRP19, SRP54 and the SRP68/72 heterodimer. SRP54 is playing the key role in recognising signal sequences of nascent polypeptide chains and docking SRP to its receptor at the membrane. In archaeal cells like Methanococcus jannaschii, the SRP is simpler and consists of 7S RNA and two homologues of the eukaryotic SRP proteins, namely SRP19</p></div>

Insight into the mechanism by which SRP functions in signal-sequence binding and release requires the knowledge of the protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions within the S-domain of SRP. Therefore, we are aiming for a high-resolution structure of the M.jannaschii ternary complex comprising 7S.S RNA, SRP19 and SRP54.</p><p>We analysed cryo-cooled crystals (0.05 x 0.1 x 0.2 mm 3 ) of the complete S-domain of M.jannaschiiconsisting of 7S.S RNA, SRP19 and full-length SRP54, on beam line ID23-1, ESRF, Grenoble in experiments conducted 07-May-04 to 08-May-04. These crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å. Diffraction data were processed using the program MOSFLM. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with cell parameters a = 70 Å, b = 129 Å, c = 165 Å. Our previously solved structure of the binary complex comprising the 7S.S RNA of M.jannaschii bound to SRP19 was used in molecular replacement searches with the program CNS and X-ray data from 10.0-4.0 Å resolution. The model was built in O and refined by CNS and REFMAC against all data from spacings between 20-2.5 Å. The R work and R free for the current model are 24.5% and 29.3%, respectively. A full structural analysis of the 7S.S RNA-SRP19-SRP54 complex is currently underway.</p></div>		</body>
