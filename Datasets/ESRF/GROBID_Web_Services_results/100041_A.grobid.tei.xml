<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The purpose of the experiments is to understand the wetting of porous materials at the nanometer scale. To achieve this objective, space-and time-dependent SAXS experiments were conducted on nanoporous materials during capillary rise of water. These experiments were planned on different porous materials. Among these samples, three of them have a different mesopore sizes, and subsequently underwent treatments aiming at modifying their microporous volume. For more information, please refer to the related proposal. In this early report, only the results of the time-resolved experiments are presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Materials investigated</head><p>Three xerogels were synthesized according to a well-established protocol through the polycondensation of resorcinol and formaldehyde in water with sodium carbonate as catalyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, and shaped as cylinders.</p><p>Some of the so-obtained mesoporous xerogels underwent a pyrolysis process under nitrogen atmosphere at 800 • C <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This resulted in carbon xerogels with micropores in addition to the mesopores (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Subsequently, a fraction of the materials were activated under a CO 2 atmosphere at 900 • C to increase the microporous volume.</p><p>In this report, we focus on four samples which are representative of all others. These samples are named CX17 P/A and CX29 P/A , with CX standing for "carbon xerogel", the numeral being the approximate mesopores size in nanometers, and the subsequent letters referring to the post-treatment, namely 'P' for pyrolysed and 'A' for activated.</p><p>In addition to the scattering experiments, all samples were characterized by state-ofthe-art porosimetry : nitrogen physisorption and mercury intrusion (see</p><p>Table 1). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>Carbon xerogels detailed in the previous section (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>) are held in place by a 3D-printed support (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>)) made so as not to interfere with the beam. An aluminium foil is added to avoid water evaporation during the capillary-rise measurements  (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(c)</ref>). The entire setup is held in place with a lab stand; the contact with water (initiating the capillary rise) is done by raising a water reservoir placed on a lab lift.</p><p>During the capillary-rise experiments, the entire setup (including the sample holder and the water reservoir) was moved back and forth vertically over approximately 30 mm, so as to perform a space-and time-resolved SAXS study (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Measurements are taken at each height, starting from z = 0 where the water comes in contact with the porous carbon, and ending at z = 30 mm, with intervals of 0.5 mm. A vertical scan takes less than 5 min whereas the capillary rise of water takes several hours.</p><p>Prior to each capillary rise experiment, i.e. before contacting the porous sample with water, a scan is performed on the dry sample to be used as a blank.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results</head><p>The following results are divided into two categories. First, the intensity drop of the X-ray beam through the sample gives us information about the quantity of water inside the sample. Then, SAXS intensity profiles provide additional information.</p><p>Scanning along vertical axis X-RAY scattering ~ 0,4 cm </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">X-ray absorption</head><p>At each height z, the beam of intensity I 0 crosses the sample composed of carbon 'c' and water 'w', and emerges with an intensity I(z). The intensity drop obeys the Beer-Lambert law :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I(z) = I 0 exp(-µ c l c ) exp(-µ w l w ) (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where µ is the linear attenuation coefficient and l is the attenuation distance related to the material in the total thickness. The value of µ w is fixed at 3.01 cm -1 according to the NIST table of attenuation coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> at 12 keV. The result obtained at each height on the dry sample is is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I(z) = I 0 exp(-µ s l s (z)) = I dry (z).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In the following, I dry (z) is used as reference for the analysis of the data obtained during the capillary rise experiment. At each height, the amount of carbon xerogel is constant, allowing us to calculate the distance travelled by the beam through water using the equation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">- ln( I(z) I dry (z) ) µ w = l w (z).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>It should be noted that the incident intensity I 0 is not constant over time. These fluctuations are corrected by assuming that the top end of the cylinder remains dry throughout the entire capillary rise experiment. If the assumption is correct, the scattered intensity only varies with the incident intensity. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(a) to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(c) we see the data evolution due to the corrections apply to the data. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(c), the water thickness increases sharply up to 98% at the bottom of the sample before slightly decreasing to 91%. Additionally, the water thickness above Z=20 varies between -1% and 1% (± 18 µm of water) indicating the potential error in the results. It is important to note that nothing has been calibrated to obtain 100% at most in the sample. Values are obtained solely from the linear attenuation coefficient of water, the measured intensity, and the sample characteristics. The first observation to be made is the two-step process of the capillary rise of water inside the porous material. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>(c), a small and progressive front of water precedes an abrupt second front of water that corresponds to the filling of almost 100% of the porous volume. It is important to note that the liquid can advance up to 1 cm in advance of the second front and its quantity is not negligible, corresponding up to 10% of the total porous volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">SAXS intensity profiles</head><p>We have access to the SAXS intensity profile at each point represented in the space and time evolution of the water thickness. These data allow us to study the wetting process in more detail. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>, the intensity profiles decrease sharply at all q-values when the liquid invades almost all of the porous volume. This decrease can be easily understood as the water replaces the air inside the porous volume and thus decreases the scattering contrast between the solid and the pores. It is also observed that the water ahead of the steep front tends to decrease the intensity at high q-values (lower than 2π/q ≈ 2 nm) and slightly increase the intensity at low q-values. This change can be interpreted as the filling of the microporous volume by the liquid, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(b)</ref>. The water inside the micropores decreases the scattering contrast between the solid and the microporous volume and increases the scattering contrast between the microporous carbon and the empty mesopores.</p><p>This precursor of impregnation only appears in the presence of microporosity. The Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.2 shows all the data obtained with CX17 and CX29. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>(a)</p><p>(a) dry Micropores filled All pores filled (b)</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>: (a) Evolution of the SAXS intensity profiles at two different height located in color in the 3D space and time evolution. The intensity at all q-values decrease when all the pores are filled with water. The intensity slightly increase at small q and decrease at high q when only the micropores are filled with water. (b) Sketch where the evolution of the scattering contrast is represented by the color contrast. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>During the capillary rise of water inside the porous material, a precursor of impregnation is found to precede up to 1 cm ahead of the water front and to fill up to 50% of the microporous volume at its edge. However, it is unclear how the water is propagating inside this microporous volume. A more advanced SAXS intensity analysis is currently being developed to investigate this question. In addition, more data than those presented in this report have been collected, and WAXS has been collected for every measurement. The observations contained in this report are already interesting enough to warrant a future publication. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Carbon xerogel sample macroscopically shaped like a rod, with hierarchical porosity displaying both (b) mesopores and (c) micropores.</figDesc></figure>
