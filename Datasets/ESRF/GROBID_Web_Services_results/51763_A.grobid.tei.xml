<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Structural dynamics of a 1D conducting thin film The purpose of the beamtime was to study the structure-function relationship in a 100 nm thin film of unidirectionally aligned chains of potassium tetracyanoplatinate.</p><p>The semiconducting compound potassium tetracyanoplatinate(II) ("TCP") forms needle-like crystals with uniaxial growth along the Pt-Pt axis. Zone-casting type thin film fabrication of the compound produces thin films ideal for studying laser-induced structural changes at the molecular scale: Upon exposure to light in the UV-region, electrons populate the conduction band of the Pt-chain thereby inducing 1D-conduction properties for the excited state system. Photo excitation in the UV causes population of the σ(6pz)-orbital between the Pt-nuclei, which in addition to the conduction character has bonding-like properties.</p><p>By laser-exciting a thin film of aligned TCP-films, we thus expected to monitor a contraction of the Pt-atoms along the Pt-Pt axis, in the affected domains of the thin film.</p><p>The TCP-films was produced on glass slides using a novel, zone-casting type fabrication technique. Prior to the beamtime, the samples where characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) polarized UV-VIS absorption and emission spectroscopy and grazing incidence x-ray scattering using a standard lab-source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p>The laser pump -X-ray probe setup at beamline ID09B was used. An array of rotating chopper wheels isolates a single X-ray pulse from the synchrotron and the sample is excited by a femtosecond laser pulse with selected arrival time prior to arrival of the X-ray pulse. A rotation stage for Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction of thin films was mounted on the goniometer, and the sample was placed in GIXD-geometry for observation of selected hklreflections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup:</head><p>The experiment was performed using a pink 15 keV X-ray beam reflected off the Rumultilayer to get rid of un-desired X-ray arising from e.g. higher harmonics. The sample was excited using a 266 nm laser beam and the diffraction images collected on a Pilatus 300 K detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We managed to get nice steady-state diffraction data for a variety of samples (cf. image below) but was not able to monitor any structural change other than what could be attributed to trivial heating induced by the laser beam. Furthermore, we tried measuring films with different thickness in order to be able to characterize the acoustic phonon contribution to the signal, but again without being able to accurately catch any phonons within experimental uncertainty.</p><p>We noted loss of scattering intensity, that was accelerated by application of nitrogen flow (in order to cool the sample). We attributed this loss in intensity to degradation of the crystal due to heating and air-floiw induced loss of crystal water from the films.</p><p>Single image &amp; difference between an off image(-3ns) and an on image (900ps)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Outlook:</head><p>Despite not being able to acquire the data we expected, we have learned some vital points about the thin film systems and their behavior in a Laser Pump/X-ray Probe experiment. These learnings will be incorporated in the forward strategy for thin film systems in our group and will hopefully result in future X-ray studies of the thin films.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Morten Christensen*, Christian Rein*, Kristoffer Haldrup*, Tim Brandt van Driel*, Martin Meedom Nielsen*, Kasper Skov Kjaer*, Asmus Ougaard Dohn §, Tobias Harlang# Elisa Biasin, Peter Vester ^ Affiliation, unless otherwise indicated: Dept. of Physics, Technical University of Denmark # Chemical Physics, Lund University, Sweden ^ University of Copenhagen, Denmark § Dept. of Chemistry, Technical University of Denmark Report: Purpose, Expected Results, Preparation:</figDesc></figure>
