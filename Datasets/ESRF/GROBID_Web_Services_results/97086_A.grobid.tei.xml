<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Overview:</p><p>The presence of Mn on Co-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts has been recently shown to significantly shift the product selectivity from classical FT products towards long chain olefins and alcohols, opening a direct path towards long-chain olefins and oxygenates from syngas mixtures (CO+H2). Via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), an approach shown to be effective for the synthesis of model catalysts for an array of reactions, we have synthesized highly dispersed Mn-doped Co nanoparticles (NP) on SiO2 (CoMn@SiO2) with tailored surfaces and interfaces to study the origin of this Mn effect. By conducting ex situ as well as in situ xray absorption spectroscopy experiments, we hope to elucidate the interplay between Co and Mn. Specifically, the speciation of the Mn within such materials and the consequences for catalytic activity, stability and selectivity. Pairing in situ XAS with other spectroscopic (IR, EPR, XPS), microscopic (TEM, STEM-HAADF, EDX) and physico-chemical characterization (Chemisorption, TPR) techniques on these materials, as well as finding the link to catalytic data represents a promising approach to contribute to the understanding of the Mn promotional effect. With rising interest towards Mn as a promoter to various catalytic systems, the outcomes of this study are potentially interesting to a broader audience in heterogeneous catalysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data obtained and experimental parameters</head><p>In situ X-ray absorption spectra data were collected on powedered samples of Co@SiO2 and CoMn@SiO2 in their non-reduced form, using quartz capillaries (o.d. 1mm, i.d. 0.9mm). All samples were supported on Degussa AEROSIL-200 (200 m 2 g -1 ). Data were collected at beam energies ranging from 6.4 -7.6 keV for the Mn K edge and from 7.65 -8.6 keV for the Co K edge. Flow rates (He, H2) were controlled using mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and pressure was retained using a back pressure regulator (Bronkhorst, EL-PRESS). Temperatures for temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were maintained using a nitrogen gas blower. Temperature calibration was preformed using a K-type thermocouple mounted inside a sample cell in prior to measurements.</p><p>Outlet gas composition was monitored using a mass spectrometer (MS, Pfeiffer vacuum) mounted after the back-pressure regulator. In a typical experiment, EXAFS spectra were acquired right after the sample was mounted and still under inert / pristine conditions at ambient temperature. Subsequently, the gas composition was changed to hydrogen and the temperature was ramped to 500 °C with a gradient of 5 °C per minute, while continously collecting XANES spectra. Depending on monometallic or bimetallic samples, the time resolution would change from 34 seconds per spectrum in a monometallic sample to 1 minute in a bimetallic sample, where to edge jumps had to be acquired. After reaching 500 °C, the quartz capillary was allowed to cool to ambient temperature for the acquisition of post-TPR EXAFS spectra. Comparison of the 1 st derivative spectra indicate the metallic state of the supported cobalt after reductive treatment (right spectra). Normalization and data processing was performed on the XAS data processing software Athena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work and anticipated output:</head><p>Currently, the data is being further processed. Especially the EXAFS part of the data will be promising in giving further insights into the state of the material after reductive treatment in presence/absence of cobalt and in dependence of various molecular precursors. Multivariate curve resolution, linear combination fitting as well as EXAFS fit are currently applied to extract further information from the obtained spectra. The data has already given intruiging insights into the reductive behaviour of different molecular precursors as well as the implication</p><p>1: Pristine EXAFS: He, 1 bar, 10 sccm 2: Reduction XANES: H2, 1 bar, 10 sccm, 5 °C min -1 3: Post-TPR EXAFS: He, 1 bar, 10 sccm 7700 7725 7750 7775 7800 7825 Normalized Absoprtion / a.u.
