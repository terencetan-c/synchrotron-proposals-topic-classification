<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the current experiment was to advance our understanding of high-pressure-high-temperature interactions between rock-forming minerals of lower mantle (i.e. ferropericlase and bridgmanite) and water by means of in situ synchrotron-based X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Synchrotron MÃ¶ssbauer Source (SMS). Several diamond anvil cells have been prepared at the Bayerisches Geoinstut (BGI) prior to the beamtime. A single crystal of ferropericlase as well as enstatite glass powder (as a precursor of bridgmanite) were loaded inside separate DACs together with water acting as a pressure-transmitting medium.</p><p>The strategy of the experiment was following: 1) XRD and SMS measurments of the compressed samples at ID15b and ID18 beamlines, respectively, prior to laser-heating (LH) sessions; 2) performance of LH at ID18 beamline and collection of SMS data on the heated spot; 3) XRD mapping of the heated area with collection of the powder and single crystal XRD at ID15b beamline; 4) depending on the samplepressure increase or DAC reload.</p><p>In the course of the experiments, we have studied ferropericlase-water interaction in the pressure range 40-65 GPa and temperature range 1400-2300 K. We have discovered that depending on the pressure, ferropericlase decomposes into (Fe, Mg)3O4 or (Fe, Mg)6.3O9 oxides. Formation of the former oxide has not been known before upon break down of ferropericlase and is of high geological interest. Our preliminary results on decomposition of enstatite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 in water-rich environment at pressures 25-45 GPa and 1500-2000 K at show that phase D is formed along with stishovite and bridgmanite. That implies that the chemical reactions in lower mantle are more complicated than previously thought. Future investigations at pressures up to 135 GPa (pressure of lower mantle-core bondary) are needed to obtain a comprehensive picture of ferropericlase-water anf bridgmaite-water interactions in the geological enviroment. The detailed analysis of the collected data is ongoing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Pakhomova Anna*, ESRF 71 avenue des Martyrs CS 40220 FR -38043 GRENOBLE Cedex 9 Dubrovinsly Leonid, Universitaet Bayreuth Bayerisches Geoinstitut Universitaetsstrasse 30 DE -95440 BAYREUTH Report:</figDesc></figure>
