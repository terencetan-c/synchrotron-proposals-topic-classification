<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GID) and X-ray reflecivity (XRR) in ambient conditions using a photon energy of 22 keV on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) used by the OMD group, i.a. BTBT-C 12 -PA (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and BTBT-C 11 -PA consisting of an insulating and semiconducting part for the use in monolayer field-effect transistors. As a solvent for all samples 2-propanol was used for the preparation of solutions with a concentration of 0.2 mM and 0.02 mM respectively. SAMs were deposited from solution in the OMD laboratory in Erlangen on aluminum oxide films (10 nm), grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as well as on sapphire with a crystal structure of (1-102) or (0001). The presence of SAMs was examined prior to the experiment by static contact angle measurements to verify a proper film formation. XRR measurements were performed on smooth aluminium oxide films, grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD), to obtain information about the vertical alignment of the SAM. The reflectivity profile and corresponding fit for BTBT-C 12 -PA is shown in figure <ref type="figure">1 a</ref>). The scattering length density (SLD) profile is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) depicting a confined peak of 0.76 nm of highly ordered BTBT moieties that are responsible for the charge transport in electronic devices. The length of hydrocarbon spacer chain (1.50 nm) is also well-resolved by the fit and corresponds well to the theoretical length.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>GID measurements were successfully performed for these systems. For each sample several GID patterns were recorded at 3 different positions of PILATUS detector with varying counting times between 3 and 20 s and moving sample position. Due to the excellent high flux of ID10 and the short counting times severe radiation damage could be averted (compared to previous beamtime at BM28). Three Bragg rods were found for BTBT-C 12 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and BTBT-C 11 and could be attributed to the (11), ( <ref type="formula">02</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) reflexes. A resulting unit cell with a herringbone structure and the lattice parameter could be deduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). Similar rods could be observed for several other samples, e.g. SAMs of C 10 -PA/C 14 -PA/C 16 -PA/C 18 -PA/F 15 C 18 -PA/F 21 C 12 -PA mixed with semiconducting C 60 -C 18 -PA and thermally evaporated sexithiophene semiconductor (Et-6T-Et) on top of a mixed SAM making these results extremely valuable for the OMD group.</p><p>All our materials were previously tested in electrical devices; the combination of electrical results with information about the structure of used materials is of great value for the community of organic electronics.
