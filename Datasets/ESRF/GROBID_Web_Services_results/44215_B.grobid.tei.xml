<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of the present experiment was to perform element selective magnetometry in ErIG at the Fe K, as well as at the Er L 2,3 edges. In order to be able to efficiently detect and to quantitatively exploit the small Fe K-edge signal, we have developed a multiframe detection scheme published in:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Previous data obtained in preparation of HE3347 showed that the R L-edge spectra change shape as a function of temperature and field. Similar beahviour was also reported in the literature for a temperature dependence. This reminds the well studied case of the rare earth transition metal intermetallics (RTI), even though the interactio pathway in ErIG is very different. In order to disentangle different spectral contributions to the XMCD signal we have tentatively applied principal component analysis to the XMCD signal. Despite the limited data quality, two dominating components could be extracted. One 'Fe-like' component very closely follows the calculated and measured curves for the Fe sublattice magnetization, whereas the the behviour of the 'Er-like' component is much less clear (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We thererfore strongly encourage the attribution of further beamtime to study the R-T interaction in the XMCD signal. Even though very similar effects were well studied in the RTIs, the case of the rare earth iron garnets merits further investigation because: 1) We observe a strong induced signal in the Ledges, but surprisingly none at the Fe Kedge. 2) The use of PCA, tested here, instead of reference samples with only one magnetic constituents is very promising. 3) The data is unfortunately compromised by strong beam heating effects that were however understood, solved and can be handled in future experiments.</p><p>We therefore strongly encourage the attribution the attribution of further beamtime for the study of the R-T interaction in the RIGs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Magnetic phase diagram of ErIG in a simplified two sublattice model.
