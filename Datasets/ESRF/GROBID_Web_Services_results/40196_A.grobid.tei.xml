The combination of a high energy beam and a spot size in the µm range requires special optic devices. In these experiments, we tested a new Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirror, which is based on a multilayer structure. It focuses hard X-rays up to 65 keV into a spot of a few µm. Using this setup, two experiments were performed: a) Determination of trace element concentrations in aqueous solutions equilibrated with alumosilicate melts are measured directly at elevated PT conditions using hydrothermal diamond-anvil cells (HDAC), and b) determination of trace element composition of inclusions in natural diamonds. A synchrotron beam with a photon energy of 50 keV for excitation and a spot size of 5×2 µm was used for both experiments.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the minimum detection limits (MDL) calculated for two standard glasses (NIST612 and ATHO) and one standard solution measured in the HDAC.</p><p>The MDL in the standard glasses are ≤20 ppm for elements with atomic numbers (Z) between 25 and 47, and ∼1 ppm for elements with 48&lt;Z&lt;60. The standard solution measured in the HDAC show slightly higher MDL of ∼30 ppm for Y, ∼15 ppm for Ba and La, and ≤10 ppm for Sm and Eu. The collected XRF spectra show a very broad inelastic scattering peak between 35 to 50 keV, in the region of many K-lines of interest. This problem can be solved by shifting to a higher excitation energies, but this was not possible because no camera was available that can be used during beam focusing. normalized intensity 50 40 30 20 10 0 energy [keV] standard solution 26 wt.% NaCl eq.

Because such magmatic fluids are not quenchable, we determined the trace element concentrations in the fluid in-situ at elevated PT conditions using a HDAC and µXRF analyses.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows that no data for Sm and Eu could be obtained because of the broad inelastic scattering peak. Yttrium and Lanthan are close to or below the detection limit in almost all runs which is probably due the formation of REE silicates during the runs. For Ba, a suite of data was collected that showed that the partitioning is mainly controlled by the salinity of the fluid, and to a lesser extent by the pressure. The Ba concentrations varied between 50 ppm in experiments with H 2 O and 400 ppm in experiments with salt solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusions in diamonds:</head><p>The goal was to investigate crystalline and non-crystallien inclusions trapped in diamonds from the Earth's interior. During the time remaining after the HDAC experiments several inclusions in various diamonds could be found and mapped. The number of inclusions that could be investigated was additionally limited by problems with the detector electronics. These investigations particularly benefitted from the small focal spot achieved with the KB optic. Due to the excitation energy of 50 keV and the strong Compton scattering by the diamond, the sensitivity for the lanthanides was still quite low. This can probably be improved by excitation at 65 keV.</p><p>In conclusion, the tested new Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror is a useful optic device to collect µXRF spectra using high excitation energies. To obtain analyzable spectra, the excitation energy should be 15 to 20 keV above the K-lines of interest due to the broad inelastic scattering peak.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Minimum detection limits for standard glasses and the standard solution.</figDesc></figure>
