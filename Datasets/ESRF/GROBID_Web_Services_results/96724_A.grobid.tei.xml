<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective</head><p>The objective of the project was to determine Fission Products (FPs) behavior in conditions representative of a Severe Accident (SA) of a nuclear LWR reactor. This will help improving the actual understanding on the FPs release mechanisms and confirming or not the hypothesis on which some codes for SA scenario predictions are based. Within this frame, the goal of this experiment was to study caesium speciation. Four SIMFUEL samples were thermally treated to simulate intermediate steps of a SA scenario. Three temperatures were used for the thermal treatments, that are 750¬∞C, 900¬∞C, 1200¬∞C (T0, T1, and T2, respectively) and the ŒîG(O2) ranged between -450 kJ/mol to -350 kJ/mol. All the samples were composed of a UO2 matrix doped with different Cscompounds, as reported in Table <ref type="table">1Table</ref> 1. The aim of the analysis was to conclude on the Cs local structure and in particular the effects of the thermodynamic conditions and the presence of Mo. Indeed, according to the model of the fission products release, an interaction between Cs and Mo could occur in the steps of a SA, but this was never experimentally observed in the Light Water Reactors (in contrast to fast neutrons reactors, where Cs2MoO4 is well known).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) XANES have thus been performed at Cs L2 edge (5359 eV). The FAME-UHD beamline is equipped with a 14-crystals CAS (crystal analyser spectrometer) made of two horizontal arrays with seven Si 400 crystals each. The configuration determines a Bragg's angle of 81.38¬∞. The beam had a rectangular size of 300 Œºm x 200 Œºm (width x height), but the samples were oriented at 45¬∞ with the respect of the longitudinal direction. In addition, the setup is completed by the helium box, which contains the crystals and most of volume between the sample and the detector. Thanks to an adjustable window made of Kapton, the photons can travel for most of their path inside helium, reducing the absorption in air to the minimum.</p><p>Table 1: SIMFUEL compositions and thermal treatments conditions (concentration in wt%) UO2 pellets with Cs-compounds (wt% concentration) 750¬∞C (T0) 900¬∞C (T1) 1200¬∞C (T2) ŒîùëÆ ÃÖ (O2) (kJ/mol) ŒîùëÆ ÃÖ (O2) (kJ/mol) ŒîùëÆ ÃÖ (O2) (kJ/mol) (CU samples) 5% Cs2UO4 -442 -386 -443 -439 (CU2 sample) 5% Cs2U2O7 ---437 (CM samples) 5% Cs2MoO4 -372 -450 -446 (CU2M samples) 2% Cs2U2O7 + 2% MoO2 -395 -442 -373 -436</p><p>The samples were kept into small resin blocks obtained by cutting the larger resin matrix used for polishing.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The first analysis concerned the references samples, i.e. those pellets made of pure Cs-compound diluted into a BN matrix. For this experiment three references were available: Cs2UO4, Cs2U2O7, and Cs2MoO4.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (a-b) reports the reference spectra: a small difference between Cs2UO4 and Cs2U2O7 can be noticed, whereas a more specific features result from Cs2MoO4 spectrum which shows a much lower white line intensity and different oscillations after the edge.</p><p>This type of result is absolutely new because such differences were never noticed in previous analyses at Cs L2/L3 edges. A more detailed analysis of the local structure showed that Cs in Cs2MoO4 has a higher number of O neighbors and with a more dispersed distribution of the Cs-O bond, in comparison with the Cs2UO4 and Cs2U2O7 structures. A direct comparison is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> below, where Cs2MoO4 and Cs2U2O7 structures are compared.</p><p>Based on these features it was possible to differentiate the Cs2MoO4 structure in the real SIMFUEL samples. Nevertheless the pure Cs2MoO4 compound spectrum was never obtained because the present Cs2MoO4 interacted with the UO2 matrix decomposing partially with the following formation of a Cs-uranate type structure. The linear combination (LC) fitting was then applied to determine the percentage of contribution of both the references (pure compounds) structures to the real SIMFUEL samples.</p><p>As general observation the concentration of Cs did not result homogeneous in the samples, as it was observed by the varying number of counts with the position. An example of the spatial scan Figure 3. Left: Cs2U2O7 structure (9 O neighbors). Right: Cs2MoO4 structure (10 O neighbors).</p><p>Figures 5-8 show the results of the different SIMFUEL samples for each composition in comparison with the reference spectra. Cs2O spectra was calculated with the FDMNES code.</p><p>For some samples more than one spectrum is collected for each condition, because of the different Cs concentration, which sometimes lead to evident differences of the resulting spectrum. Figure 4. Example of inhomogeneous Cs concentration where the red line indicates the fluorescence signal coming from the UO2 matrix, while the black curve refers to Cs signal. The different peaks in black indicate a higher Cs concentration. Figure 7. Samples CM (5 wt% Cs2MoO4) compared with the Cs2UO4 and Cs2MoO4 references Figure 8. Samples CU2M (2% Cs2U2O7 + 2% MoO2) compared with the Cs2UO4 /Cs2U2O7 and Cs2MoO4 references FINAL CONCLUSIONS</p><p>‚Ä¢ The Cs2MoO4 reference shows important differences compared with the Cs-uranate references.</p><p>The high number of counts (&gt;8000 cts at 5.4 keV) ensures that these differences are real; ‚Ä¢ Often the Cs is found concentrated to the edges of the pellet, suggesting a migration during the thermal treatments; ‚Ä¢ Sometimes within the same sample, two positions show important differences in their spectra.</p><p>Normally a correlation can be noticed between number of counts and spectrum (similar number of cts have similar spectra); ‚Ä¢ The UO2+Cs2MoO4 (CM) samples (750-900-1200) do not show pure Cs2MoO4 characteristics, especially the intensity. However the LC fitting allows to determine a contribution of Cs2MoO4 spectrum between 16% to 49% compared with Cs2UO4 reference. The thermal treatment must have influenced the Cs environment causing a decomposition and interaction with the UO2 matrix. ‚Ä¢ For T2 (1200 ¬∞C) the deepest change from the reference can be noticed, demonstrating the effect of temperature on the Cs environment: the spectra tend to have a much higher white line intensity and a different oscillation, independently on the initial presence of Mo. This suggests that at 1200¬∞C either another unknown Cs-uranate or Cs-oxide structure is formed; ‚Ä¢ By adding Mo K edge analyses it would be possible to have more reliable conclusions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig.1-cshows the sample holder used for XANES (in this case the block-sample is wrapped into a 8 Œºm Kapton foil).
