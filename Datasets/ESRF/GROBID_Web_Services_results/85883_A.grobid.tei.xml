<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title: Single crystal XRD structural analysis of extremely small crystals of molecular multiferroics and porous molecular magnets</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>From 03.10.2017 (8am) to 04.10.2017 (7am) a series of single-crystal diffraction experiments were performed for very small single crystal samples of high nuclearity molecular compounds (coordination clusters) and porous coordination polymers (including potential molecular multiferroics) at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline BM01. Over 20 samples crystallizing in form of tiny single crystals (&lt;50 µm) and/or having a very large unit cell (more than 50 000 Å 3 ) were selected. During the 3 shifts, the data for 18 single crystals were collected affording 15 crystal structures. The most important results are described below.</p><p>The first group of compounds that were investigated using the BM01 beamline were three-dimensional (3-D) cyanide-bridged bimetallic coordination networks incorporating additional bridging ligands connecting 3d metal ionspotential molecular multiferroics. The most interesting ones are</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(NH 4 )[(H 2 O)Co II -(µ-HCOO)-Co II (H 2 O)][Nb(CN) 8 ]•3H 2 O (1), (NH 4 )[(H 2 O)Fe II -(µ-N 3 )-Fe II (H 2 O)][Mo(CN) 8 ]•3H 2 O (2), [(H 2 O)Mn II -(µ-HCOO)- Fe III (H 2 O)][Nb(CN) 8 ]•4H 2 O (3) and [(H 2 O)Fe II -(µ-HCOO)-Fe III (H 2 O)][Nb(CN) 8 ]•4H 2 O (4).</formula><p>Insertion of the additional ligand into the 3-D CN-bridged framework of these compounds is expected to induce magnetic frustration/spin-cantin, which will be studied using a SQUID magentometer. Studies of these type of compounds will lead to the discovery and understanding of the design prinicples of molecualar spin-ice materials. Especially</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(NH 4 )[(H 2 O)Co II -(µ-HCOO)- Co II (H 2 O)][Nb(CN) 8 ]•3H 2 O</formula><p>(1), which crystallize in the form of extremely small single crystals (&lt;20 µm) is expected to show intriguing magnetic behavior due to the inherent magnetic anisotropy of Co II ions. Additionally, as <ref type="formula">1</ref>) crystallizes in a polar I4cm space group with all hydrogen atoms of the formate anions oriented along the crystallographic c direction (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), it is considered a potential multiferroica compound combining magnetic and electric ordering. Its dielectric behavior will be studied soon.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(NH 4 )[(H 2 O)Co II -(µ-HCOO)- Co II (H 2 O)][Nb(CN) 8 ]•3H 2 O (</formula><p>We have also managed to determine crystal structures of several porous/magnetic sponge-like compounds, among them [Mn(H 2 O) 2 (dpe)] 8 [Nb(CN) 8 ] 4 •18H 2 O•10dpe (5) (dpe = trans-1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene). It forms a structure of two-dimensional cyanide-bridged layers, pillared by the organic dpe ligands. Additional intercalated dpe molecules are located 3.7 Å from the bridging ones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), providing an opportunity for observation of their 2+2 photocycloaddition upon UV light irradiation (respective experiments were already conducted and the photocycloaddition was confirmed by means of IR spectroscopy). Unfortunately, (5) crystallizes in a triclinic crystal system (P-1 space group) and the completeness of the crystal data is below 90% (only phi scans were possible due to the unavailability of the four circle goniometer).</p><p>The diffraction data for two-dimensional (2-D) cyanide-bridged Cu-[W(CN) 8 ] layered multiferroics incorporating two different organic cations: triethylenediammonium (dabcoH 2 ) and imidazolium (imH 2 ) were also collected: <ref type="formula">6</ref>) and (imH 2 ){Cu II [W V (CN) 8 ]xH 2 O (7). However, the thin plate-like crystals of both compounds suffered from heavy twinning and there are still on-going efforts to refine their crystal structures. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> presents the tentative structural models a layered of both compounds.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(dabcoH 2 ){Cu II 2 [W V (CN) 8 ] 2 } (</formula><p>The most prominent results of our experiment are the crystal structures of a family of trimetallic nineteen-nuclear cage molecules exhibiting huge unit cells and large empty spaces filled with solvent molecules. The crystal structures have been solved and refined successfully: Cu 6 Ni 6 Fe 7 (8) and Cu 6 Mn 6 Fe 7 (9). These molecules belong to the family of molecular Prussian Blue analogues. Along with the not-yet-published Co 12 Fe 7 cluster, which was studied by means of standard diffraction system equipped with a sealed-tube source, they are elegant examples of this intesively studied group of compounds. The presence of two different coordination sites within each cluster (octahedral and square pyramidal) enabled synthesis of mixed metal trimetallic clusters with Cu II cations occupying square pyramidal positions and the high resolution synchrotron data enabled successful determination of their crystal structures.</p><p>The determination of the crystal structures of the originally proposed porous coordination polymers based on [(NC) 7 Mo IV -CN-Pt IV (L) 4 -NC-Mo IV (CN) 7 ] 4-(MoPtMo) was unsuccessful, due to the very poor quality of the crystals. The only samples suitable for X-ray diffraction appeared to be (dppipH 2 ) 2 [Mo(CN) 8 ]xH 2 O (10)a decomposition product.</p><p>The first papers describing the results obtained at BM01 will be published in 2018.
