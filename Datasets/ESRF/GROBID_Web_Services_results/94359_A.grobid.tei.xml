<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This proposal aimed at realising a synergy among a team of (experienced) users working on different projects related to oil painting compositions and conservation, but sharing the same techniques, in view of implementing a Block Allocation Group (BAG) proposal system for this experiment types in the future. As a result, this proposal encompassed several sub-projects. While the studied materials were different for each sub-project (among them, lead phosphates; arsenic sulphide-pigments, copper acetate-based pigments…), the analytical objectives were identical : characterizing the composition, microstructure and stratigraphic distribution of each class of pigment and of their associated degradation products within historical paint down to the sub-micrometric scale. A combination of high-angular resolution XRD combined with Rietveld analysis (ID22) and high-lateral resolution µXRPD mapping (ID13) was applied to each materials. Due to the sanitary situation, all the experiments were performed in remote mode. Samples were shipped to the ESRF, and positionned for analysis on the beamline by beamlime staff. Users were able to carry out analysis remotely, access the electronic logbook and collect their data at the end of the experiment. Samples were then shipped back to users.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>A) High-angle resolution XRD (ID22) The versatily of the ID22 HR-XRD beamline allowed us to select a wavelength of λ = 0.354 Å (35 keV). This wavelength was chosen after preliminaries tryouts on historical samples: it permited the obtention of a good compromise to render a good peak resolution, and a sufficient data collection. The detector was a 9-channel Si 111 multianalyzer stage. Beam size was 1x1 mm². This surface allowed a global analysis of the entirety of each sample, once they were corectly aligned with the beam. Each recording was constituted by an accumulation of succesive diffractograms, on an angular range [2°,20°(2θ)]. Analysis times extended from 1 to 4 hours, according to the amount of diffracting matter contained in the capillary (that is to say, the size of the sample). B) High-lateral resolution XRD (ID13) µXRD maps were acquired at the ID13 "microbranch" beamline (ESRF). Samples were either thin (10µm) sections or thick sections, of paint fragments embedded in resin. Samples were mounted vertically, perpendicular to the X-ray beam. The energy of the incident beam was 13.0 keV. The beam was focused to 2x2 µm². XRD maps were obtained by raster scanning the samples and collecting XRD 2D patterns, in transmission, with the Dectris Eiger 4M single photon counting. A dwell time of 25ms/pixel was selected. 2D XRD patterns were azimuthally integrated using the PyFAI software package and XRD maps were analysed with the XRDUA and the PyMca ROI imaging software packages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>As this proposal involved several research teams, each one of them presents here the results they gathered on beamline(s) ID13 and/or ID22.</p><p>Table 1 -Samples overview.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status of the data processing</head><p>Phase identification and mapping were performed on the two micro-cross sections. Identification of minor phases are currently under investigation and correlation of µ-XRD results with µ-PL and µ-XRF/XANES (performed at ESRF) are in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results obtained</head><p>µ-XRD analyses have allowed to determine the presence of crystalline CdS only in preserved layer (in both crystalline forms, cubic and hexagonal). No diffraction peaks associated to CdS were found in the altered sample. This finding has allowed us to provide a first evidence of the different crystallinity of the CdS present in the preserved and degraded layer and could validate the hypothesis that the degraded CdY is composed of poorly crystalline or nanometric CdS. In addition to the paint components already identified, µ-XRD analyses detected PbSO4, ascribed to lead white degradation, and Cd-Cl compounds. This latter were found in different chemical species between the paints, CdCl2 in the preserved and Cd(OH)Cl in the degraded. The comparison between the distribution of crystalline compounds and PL measurements did not highlight any evident spatial correlation between the peculiar red PL emission observed in the degraded CdY paints and the distribution of crystalline compounds. Since this PL emission can be related to the presence of nano-CdS, not mapped by µ-XRD, other results obtained with µ-XRF/XANES maps will help to clarify this issue.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context and motivation of the research</head><p>The influence of magnesium in the process of carbonation of a dolomitic mortar modifies the morphology of the carbonate particles formed and, consequently, the mechanical and chemical properties of the mortar layer and the final aspect of the wall painting. The chemical interactions in the system CaO/MgO/H2O/CO2 make its study of especial interest. In particular, the influence that magnesium alone may have in the carbonation process without considering the role of the other components present in the mortar may have. The low degree of carbonation of magnesium hydroxide attained and the wide diversity of the amorphous and crystalline carbonate phases obtained during the drying of the dolomitic mortar is, a priori, heavily conditioned by the reaction conditions (pH, evaporation rate???). This research forms part of a thesis of N. Oriols. A series of laboratory mock-ups of the process of carbonation of a dolomitic mortar in fresco paintings, as well as, of dried magnesium hydroxide and dolomitic lime water drops simulating the different states in the evolution of the drying process are analysed.</p><p>Analysed samples 2 samples: Micrometric painting fragment from fresco painting mockups, embedded in resin and cut as thin sections, mounted on tape. 5 samples: powder and film mortar from dried magnesium hydroxide water drops and dolomitic lime-water drops simulating the different states in the evolution of the drying process and mounted on tape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status of the data processing</head><p>The data obtained from the dried drops 5 samples are already processed, while these from the thin sections are still in process as it has to be related to the data obtained with other analytical techniques results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results obtained</head><p>The carbonation phases formed in the dried magnesium water drops identified include several magnesium hydroxide carbonates, Hidromagnesite, Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2•4H2O and Giorgiosite, Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2.5H2O while Brucita, Mg(OH)2 is still present. On the contrary, the dried dolomitic lime-water drops show the presence of Brucite, Mg(OH)2, absence of magnesium carbonates and the formation of calcium carbonates including Calcite, CaCO3 and Aragonite, CaCO3. These results are important for the determination and understanding of the role which Mg has in the carbonation process of a dolomitic mortar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eventual communication of results (manuscript in preparation, conference…)</head><p>Currently we are writing an article including the data obtained so far, on the influence of Magnesium in the carbonation of wall paintings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context and motivation of the research</head><p>The darkening of historic lead white, mostly hydrocerussite, in areas of wall paintings by famous (Italian) artists such as Cimabue, Baldovinetti and Signorelli is a phenomenon that can be attributed to the spontaneous formation of black plattnerite(β-PbO2) from hydrocerussite(2PbCO3.Pb(OH)2), that was originally present in the paintings. The main hypothesis is that the conversion of lead white to β-PbO2 proceeds in two consecutive parts, with phosgenite(PbCO3.PbCl2) as an intermediate step.</p><p>(A) Phosgenite formation by partial CO2 and H2O removal, and reduction of Cl2 to Cl -in situ formation of O2: 2(2PbCO3.Pb(OH)2) + 3Cl2 → 3 PbCO3.PbCl2 + CO2 + 2H2O + O2 (B) Secondary oxidation of phosgenite to mixtures of cotunnite(PbCl2) and plattnerite: 2 PbCO3.PbCl2 + Cl2 → PbO2 + 3PbCl2 + 2CO2 In order to verify this hypothesis, powdered lead white has been prepared and exposed to a Cl2 rich environment aiming to understand the oxidation of lead white to plattnerite by chlorine and light.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysed samples</head><p>A fixed amount of lead white in powder form was exposed to Cl2-rich atmosphere. This procedure was repeated three times employing three different time lengths: 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours. Three different samples were obtained in this way.</p><p>-One sample containing powdered lead oxide from Aldrich, observed to be mostly rich in massicot and with presence of hydrocerussite plumbonacrite and litharge was exposed to cycles of UV light and darkness in a high humidity environment to verify the possible formation of Pb 4+ species. -Two samples containing an unknown compound obtained through interaction of powdered cerussite and powdered hydrocerussite with hydrogen peroxide. The unknown compound has been observed to form Pb 4+ . Glass capillaries were filled with the exposed/reacted powders before being sent to ESRF for analyses at ID22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status of the data processing</head><p>The main crystalline compounds in the samples were identified and the structure of the unknown compound is being refined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results obtained</head><p>Formation of plattnerite was identified along with the formation of phosgenite and cotunnite. These results confirm the initial hypotheses. Furthermore, unreacted hydrocerussite is still present, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eventual communication of results (manuscript in preparation, conference…)</head><p>The data collected will be employed to submit a manuscript defining the factors triggering the oxidation of lead white.

The formation of crystalline Pb-Ca phosphates has been recently observed in several historical objects, including a masterpiece by L. da Vinci. [1] However, the source of P ions and the pathways of formation of Pb-Ca phosphates in paint layers are still issues which remain poorly understood. In order to obtain a more in depth characterization of the chemical nature of Pb-Ca phosphates already identified in cultural heritage objects, as a first step of the research a series of commercial/in-house synthesized powders of hydroxyapatite [Ca5(PO4)3OH], Pb-Ca hydroxyapatite solid solutions [Ca1-xPbx(PO4)6(OH)2, with 0.1≤x0.8], and hydroxylpyromorphite [Pb5(PO4)3OH] have been analyzed at beamlines ID13 (µ-XRPD mapping) and ID22 [high angular resolution (HAR) XRPD]. Such investigations aimed at determining the Ca:Pb stoichiometry and microstructural properties of each material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysed samples</head><p>Powders were in-house synthesized by following the procedures reported in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> A list of the analyzed samples along with their chemical formula is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>This experiment succesfully paved the way for the establishment of a BAG mode of access for structual analysis of historical materials at the ESRF. Indeed, several key points were proven: i) Remote operations are feasible : all the samples were shipped to the ESRF, and experiments followed using the Guacamole software. Users were then able to collect their respective data and work from their home institutions ; ii) A large volume of data was gathered for 8 European teams, in only 12 shifts at ID13 and 9 shifts at ID22. What would have required multiple proposals in competition was achived in only two beamtimes, during which all users collaborated efficiently with the ESRF staff iii) High quality datasets were obtained, permiting us to gain new insights into the artistic process of Old Masters, the conservation state of historical materials, and yielding precious assets for the long-term preservation and conservation of artworks.</p><p>We are thus confident that the submission of a BAG for the heritage science community could fundamentally increase the impact of the combination HR-XRD/µXRD for the study of historical materials at the ESRF.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: High resolution 1d pattern of lead white after exposure to a Cl2 rich environment for three hours.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,323.30,509.50,238.05,130.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main obtained results and status of the data processing</head><p>Powders were investigated at beamlines ID13 (Energy=13 keV, beam size 2.5×2.5 µm 2 ) and ID22 (Energy=35 keV, beam size: 1.0x1.0 mm 2 ) by µ-XRPD mapping and HR-XRPD respectively. ID13-XRPD patterns (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) were obtained as average of single-pixel XRPD patterns recorded from a map of 200×200 µm 2 size (step size: 2×2 µm 2 ; exposure time: 25 ms/pixel). ID22-XRPD data were combined into 0.002° bins (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</p><p>The XRPD patterns obtained at each beamline are comparable, showing a clear progressive shift of the peaks towards lower q values with increasing of Pb molar fraction in the Ca1-xPbx(PO4)6(OH)2 solid solution. ID22-XRD patterns present sharper peaks than the equivalent ID13-ones, as result of the higher angular resolution of the ID22 set-up. Data recorded at both beamlines are in line with those acquired by the laboratory XRD device. Rietveld refinement of each XRD pattern is ongoing in order to determine the exact stoichiometry and microstructural properties of the analyzed compound. This will also permit to more accurately/quantitatively assess eventual differences between ID13-and ID22-datasets.</p></div>
