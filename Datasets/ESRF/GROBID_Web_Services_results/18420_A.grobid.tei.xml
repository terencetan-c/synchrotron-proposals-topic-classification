<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>X-ray diffraction measurements in 30-50 Å thick nanostructured films of CoPt 3 were performed successfully on the 7-circle diffractometer of the CRG-BM02 beamline using a photon wavelength of 1.6137 Å (i.e. at an energy below the Co-K edge). Due to the van der Waals-type of the WSe 2 (0001) surface, the high mobility of the adatoms leads to the formation of self-organized monocristalline nanostructures with an 111-oriented fcc structure, a hexagonal prism shape and a narrow lateral size distribution on the order of a few nanometers, as observed from RHEED and STM measurements in 1ML deposits. For thicker deposits (30-50 Å), these films consist of dense assemblies of such nanostructures.</p><p>The main objective of these experiments was to confirm a bulk L1 2 -type chemical ordering in films deposited at relatively low temperatures, typically occuring at 150°C, which is a growth temperature considerably lower than that required to obtain ordered continuous films (higher than 500°C). This chemical ordering was observed from in-situ RHEED observations. Due to the nanostructured shape of these films, we have measured 3D-RHEED patterns, where the occurrence of L1 2 -type ordering was clearly indicated by the presence of intermediate RHEED spots (superstructure spots). However, due to the highest surface sensitivity of the RHEED technique, it was important to use a volume sensitive technique like x-ray diffraction to measure the chemical ordering in the whole film.</p><p>To determine the chemical ordering parameter, S, we have thus measured the 113 and 112 reflections with their rocking curves for different samples grown at 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600°C, accessible in reflection geometry.</p><p>The ratio of their integrated intensities corrected for absorption and Lorentz factors lead to the values of S, which are given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> as a function of the growth temperature. For comparison the values deduced from the ratio of the raw intensities of superstructure and fundamental spots corresponding to the 021 and 111 reflexions, observed by RHEED (taken along the [11-2] azimuth) are also reported. It turns out that the growth temperature dependence of the bulk order parameter measured by x-ray is quite similar to that deduced from the qualitative RHEED order parameter. The formation of L1 2 -ordered nanostructure of CoPt 3 already occuring at growth temperatures as low as 200°C is thus confirmed. This low onset temperature of chemical ordering compared to that observed in continuous films grown on Pt(111)/Al 2 O 3 ( <ref type="formula">0001</ref>) is attributed to their nanostructured shape which enhances the possibilities of atomic arrangements available on both top and side-wall facets during the co-deposition process.</p><p>Other important results obtained from this series of x-ray diffraction measurements are the following ones.</p><p>1) A decrease of chemical ordering by increasing the deposit from 30 to 50 Å was observed for nanostructured films deposited at 200°C. As could be expected, a gradual approach towards the behaviour of the continuous films is therefore observed. However, above 50 Å, the monocrystalline quality of the nanostructured films seems difficult to preserve as a consequence of the large misfit between the substrate and the CoPt 3 alloy, as it was observed for films deposited at RT and 200°C.</p><p>2) The normal coherence lengths deduced from the widths of the 222 reflections give estimates of the heights of the nanostructures (such analysis from the111 reflections was prevented by the vicinity of the very strong reflection 0006 coming from the substrate). Provided that the monocristalline quality is similar in the differently grown nanostructured films, the average height, first roughly constant around 40 Å for nanostructures grown between RT and 300°C increases then markedly up to a value of 85 Å for the film grown at 600°C. 3) A complete description of these nanostructured films would require to perform transmission measurements in order to obtain in-plane structural information. Due to the long measurement times necessary for recording the 112 reflections (100 s/pt on a large angular range), transmission measurements were performed on only two samples grown at RT but exhibiting different thicknesses, 30 and 50 Å. The measurement of the 2-20 reflections has allowed to precise the small tensile strain in the film plane, already expected from the position of the 113 reflection. For the 30 Å thick sample the parameters of the rhombohedral unit cell, which decribes the distorted fcc stacking, are equal to 3.83 Å and 90.32°. Furthermore, the length of the a-axis allows to check the average composition of the film, based on the variation of the lattice parameter with the alloy composition known precisely in bulk Co x Pt 1-x alloys. The lateral coherence length deduced from the width of the 2-20 reflection, equal to 85 Å in both films, is in good agreement with the lateral size of the nanostructures deduced from STM analysis. 0 1 00 2 00 3 00 4 00 5 00 6 00 7 00 8 00 0 ,0 0 ,2 0 ,4 0 ,6 0 ,8 1 ,0 d ep osition tem perature [°C ] o rd e rin g p ara m e te r S 3000 Å C o P t (111 ) o n P t(111 ) 3 30 Å C o P t (111 ) o n W S e (R H E E D ) 3 2 30 Å C o P t (111 ) o n W S e (X R D ) 3 2</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Chemical long-range ordering in self-organized CoPt 3 (111) nanostructures grown on WSe 2 (0001)</figDesc></figure>
