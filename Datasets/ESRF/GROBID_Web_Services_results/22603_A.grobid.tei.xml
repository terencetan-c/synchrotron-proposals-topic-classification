<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diamond Anvil Cell experiments at high pressures (0.3 -1.2 GPa) and temperatures (25 -800°C) were performed on the Id22 µFID beamline. In order to understand magma genesis in subduction zones, the fluid/melt partition coefficients of Pb were experimentally studied. The equilibrium between aqueous fluids and silicate melts before and after their complete miscibility, and the composition of the different components in these phases were characterized in situ at a micrometer scale for every stage of the high pressure and temperature experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p><p>The experimental setup comprised a Compound Refractive lens, ensuring the focusing of monochromatized X -rays at 15 keV, with a flux of 5.10 9 photons per second. In order to restrict the scatter beam, a Pt/Cu pinhole of 5 µm diameter was positioned behind the lens, thus allowing to obtain a spacial resolution of 1.5*5 µm 2 . The beam was monitored by silicon PIN-diodes. The incident beam irradiating the cell was normal to the diamond surface. An X-ray CCD camera was set in transmission geometry to observe the sample during the heating stages. X -ray fluorescence measurements were carried out with an energy dispersive solid state Si(Li) detector, set at 11.5° to the incident beam, in the horizontal plane. Experiments were carried out with an externally heated Bassett-modified Hydrothermal Diamond Anvil Cell, which allows a direct visual observation of the equilibrium between components at high pressures and temperatures. The sample was contained in a rhenium gasket compressed by two diamond (sample chamber diameter 400-200 µm). Pressure medium in all experiments was an aqueous fluid and was calculated, at a given temperature, from the appropriate equation of state of the fluid phase.</p><p>Starting materials were a synthetic haplogranitic glass together with one aqueous fluid, either pure water or NaCl aqueous solution (15 g/l). Lead was alternatively present in solution or in synthetic glass. To monitor the compositions of coexisting fluids and melts during the heating stages and also in the vicinity of the miscibility, trace element distributions and concentrations were determined in situ d uring experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Single analyses were recorded with an acquisition time of 2 to 15 min. 2D scans of the cell were performed using a 30 s per step integration time.</p><p>The    25°C 200°C 390°C 510°C 600°C 710°C 760°C 780°C 810°C 850°C P = 0.9 GPa Energy (keV) 2.4 3.6 4.8 6 7.2 8.4 9.6 10.8 1 2 13.2 4 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 2 4 2 8 Pb Re W A r C a C r Fe N i C l Energy (keV) Sqrt(Counts ) Sqrt(Counts ) 2.4 3.6 4.8 6 7.2 8.4 9.6 10.8 1 2 13.2 4 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 2 4 2 8 3 2 3 6 Pb Re W A r C a C r Fe N i C l Measurement in the melt (750°C, 0.75 GPa) Measurement in the aqueous fluid (765°C, 0.77 GPa) 50 µm Re Pb C a Cl 2900 2000 1000 0 3000 1000 0 3800 2000 13 10 5 0 5 0 14 10 quenched 25°C 100 µm</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Bureau Hélène*, Massare Dominique (LPS, CE Saclay, 91191 Gif sur Yvette, France) Ménez Bénédicte* (LGM, IPG Paris, 4 place Jussieu 75275 Paris cedex 05, France), Malavergne Valérie* (IFG, Univ Marne la Vallée, 77454 Marne la Vallée cedex 2, France)</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>determination of Pb partition coefficient (D Pb fluid/melt =C Pb fluid /C Pb melt ) between hydrous silicate melts and aqueous fluids in the P -T conditions corresponding to the upper mantle in subduction zones is currently in progress. Results were presented at two meetings (VII International Conference on X -Ray Microscopy, Grenoble July 2002; Diffusion Inélastique des Rayons X et Photoémission de Haute Energie à Soleil, Paris Juin 2002). They provide information on (1) the nature of the contaminant agent (a silicate melt or an aqueous fluid) responsible of the unique Pb signature in subduction zone magmas; (2) the potential role of chlorine in this contamination process.</figDesc></figure>
