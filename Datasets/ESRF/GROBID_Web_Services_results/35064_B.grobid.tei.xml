<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We performed room temperature, grazing incidence, inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) experiments on a 5 micron thick 5x7 mm 2 surface wurtzite InN thin film in order to investigate both the phonon dispersion relations and the elastic tensor. The sample was obtained by MBE growth at 600 0 C on a (0001) sapphire substrate using a GaN buffer layer.</p><p>The grazing incident IXS experiments were conducted at beamline ID28 at ESRF. We employed backscattered monochromatic 17.794 keV x-rays deflected by a flat platinum coated mirror to achieve grazing incidence on the sample, yielding 3 meV energy resolution and using a toroidal mirror to provide a spot size of 60x250 Âµm 2 (vertical x horizontal). A 5-analyzer configuration was employed to maximize sampling on the Brillouin zone in each acquisition. The experiments were conducted with the guide of our own ab-initio calculated phonon dispersion relations and scattering intensities. This turned out to be essential to ascertain the scattering configurations with highest signal and optimized the beamtime use.</p><p>These experiments provided the first reported data on the phonon dispersion relations of wurtzite InN, particularly for acoustic modes and low energy optical modes. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> displays the phonon dispersion relations for the main high symmetry directions, highlighting the excellent overall agreement between the ab-initio calculated dispersion (solid and dashed lines) and the IXS data (symbols). Information on the elastic constants was also extracted for all different symmetry directions thus yielding the complete elastic tensor for wurtzite InN (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Elastic stiffness constants of wurtzite InN obtained from the IXS data for the acoustic branches, compared to data obtained from temperature dependence of XRD broadening <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The results of these experiments were reported in a regular publication on Physical Review Letters [1], and represent as well the first phonon dispersion data reported on epitaxially grown thin films, to the best of our knowledge.</p></div>
