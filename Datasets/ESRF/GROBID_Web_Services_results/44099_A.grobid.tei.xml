<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have measured the crystal structure of ZrZn 2 with increasing pressure from 0 to 20 GPa by performing powder diffraction measurements on beamline ID09A inside a diamond anvil cell both at room temperature and at 10 K. ZrZn 2 crystallises in the cubic C15 Laves phase structure at ambient pressure and temperature. At low temperature ZrZn 2 has ferromagnetic order with a Curie temperature of 28.5 K at ambient pressure. As pressure is applied to ferromagnetic ZrZn 2 the magnetic ordering temperature is suppressed to around 0.9 GPa at 10K (2 GPa at 50mK). The nature of the magnetic state and any new quantum states observed on the border of magnetism are closely related to the crystal structure and hence the motivation for this study. An as yet unidentified new quantum state has been observed in resistivity measurements in ZrZn 2 above the magnetic suppression pressure at low temperature (T&lt;15K). Our measurements at the ESRF have allowed us to study the changes in crystal structure which occur in this region of the ZrZn 2 phase diagram.</p><p>In our ESRF measurements we have observed clear evidence for a volume instability in ZrZn 2 around 0.8-1.0 GPa as the pressure was increased at 10K. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that there is a clear change in gradient of the lattice parameter compression in this region. This corresponds to the pressure at which the ferromagnetic ordering temperature is suppressed at 10K with the corresponding observation of unusual power laws in resistivity data which occur at the quantum phase transition. We have seen no evidence for a volume instability as the pressure was increased at room temperature when the sample was paramagnetic throughout the whole pressure range studied indicating the significance in the collapse of the ferromagnetic order to the volume instability.</p><p>We have performed structural refinement of the powder diffraction data using the GSAS software and have seen no evidence for a structural phase transition up to the highest pressure studied of 20 GPa (fig 2) either at low temperature or room temperature. This shows that there are subtle, but significant structural changes that are occurring at the quantum phase transition on the border of ferromagnetism and that these are likely to have a bearing on the magnetic order and nature of the new quantum state observed in our resistivity data. The low temperature data is being used to perform density functional theory and energy calculations on ZrZn 2 .  0 5000 1x10 4 1.5x10 4 2x10 4 2.5x10 4 5 10 15 20 25 Intensity (arbitrary units) Angle (2Î¸) 0.4 GPa 1.0 GPa 2.1 GPa 3.7 GPa 6.5 GPa 8.5 GPa 12.2 GPa 15.0 GPa 16.8 GPa 19.5 GPa</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Pressure dependence of the lattice parameters for ZrZn 2 at 10K obtained from high pressure, low temperature powder diffraction study at ESRF (ID09A).
