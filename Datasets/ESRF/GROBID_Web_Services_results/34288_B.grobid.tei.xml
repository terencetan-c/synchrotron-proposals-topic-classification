<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) and absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are the principal techniques used to investigate long and short-range order of atoms and molecules in the solid state, respectively. The Raman technique, in contrast, has the ability to probe the length scale between these two extremes. The synergy between these methodologies has attracted application to many scientific studies where the Raman and XRD or XAS techniques have been performed ex-situ. The purpose of this LTP proposal is to marry these fundamental probes in the development of the first beamline station offering in-situ Raman spectroscopy combined with powder XRD or single crystal XRD or XAS. This new approach will open up many new avenues of research and offer vital new detail in the study of materials and solid state sciences. To develop and fully exploit the combined Raman and XRD/XAS techniques on the SNBLs requires the design, testing and application of new instrumentation such as dedicated in situ reaction chambers and non-ambient conditions sample environments, along with the commissioning of a suitable commercial Raman spectrometer. To facilitate this new initiative we are requesting beam time on the BM01A and B instruments. All manpower and ancillary equipment costs will be provided for by the consortium's research groups. This project constitutes a major development in synchrotron methodology and will be made available for future user applications and thus offering ESRF excellent value-for-money and world class new science. It is important to note that the aim of this project is to provide long standing support for combined Raman -XRD/XAS at the ESRF. In doing so, it is essential that a broad range of user needs are taken into consideration. The LTP is essential not only to provide the resources required for the project, but also to enable a number of representative users, who will be stationed at the ESRF for an extended period, to directly contribute to its development. These users have been carefully chosen to cover a wide range of experiments from zeolite and metal-organic framework chemistry to electronic properties of oxides and mixed valence polycyanides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract of the background to the original proposal:</head><p>This work has been organized from the start on in very close contact and agreement with the SNBL's management and staff. The proposal was also accepted by the SNBL review committee despite the fact that all consortium members are neither Swiss nor Norwegian. The beamtime requested to both committees was hence relatively modest compared to the vast planned experimental program. Both committees granted the beamtime and the full experimental program can be performed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific achievements:</head><p>Three out of five User groups have come to carry out experiments. All experimental reports are included in this document. The fourth group had received more time during the first year and the remaining 5th experiment of the second round is planned in February 2009. Four publications are in preparation or under revision from Consortium members out of the experiments performed during the first and second year of the LTP. The work has also been presented at several international conferences with numerous oral presentations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SNBL Workshop on 18 th and 19 th of June 2008 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France)</head><p>A workshop has been organized to highlight the possibilities of the combined and/or simultaneous multi-technique approaches: "Simultaneous Raman-X-ray diffraction/absorption studies for the in situ investigation of solid state transformations, and reactions at non ambient conditions". More than 70 people attended. The workshop was focused on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are the principal techniques used to investigate long and short-range order of atoms and molecules in the solid state, respectively. The Raman technique, in contrast, has the ability to probe the length scale between these two extremes. The synergy between these methodologies attracted application to many scientific studies where the Raman and XRD or XAS techniques have been previously performed ex-situ. SNBL has a long record in combining HRPD and XAFS methods. The recent results obtained with the aid of Raman spectrometers available at SNBL have also been described in different presentations by the LTP members.</p><p>1.

The first experiment represents the continuation and completion of the experiments in July 2007, while exp.2-4 are fully novel ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Decarboxilation of layered zirconium aminophosphonates</head><p>Layered zirconium phosphonates are extensively studied, because of their good versatility in building up tailor made compounds in which the structure and the chemical reactivity can be tuned by the right choice of the pendant organic groups, placed in the interlayer region. Recently, we developed a new class of layered zirconium diphosphonates by reaction of zirconium fluorocomplexes with amino-N,Nbismethylphosphonic acids. Due to the presence of carboxylate groups this compound can easily intercalate long-chain polar organic molecules in the interlayer region, and can be even exfoliated with the formation of stable colloidal dispersions of single lamellae of nanometric dimension. This feature opens up interesting prospects for application as fillers for polymer nanocomposites. The crucial step of decarboxilation was studied by in situ Raman/XRPD experiment. When heated this compound shows a phase transformation with a remarkable reduction of its interlayer distance, due to the loss of 1 mol of HF/mol of compound and to a change in the zirconium environment. In July 2007 the in situ structural characterization, using combined diffraction, spectroscopic of a new layered zirconium aminomethyl diphosphonate, contanining caproic acid into interlayer region was carried out to study the preparation process. In July 2008 the study was extended to analogous derivatives containing molecule of different length and shape (proline and glycine) into the layer to exhaustively investigate the organic moiety effect on the synthesis process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) In situ Study of the thermal treatment of palygorskite-indigo to produce Maya blue</head><p>The Maya blue pigment has attracted the attention of many research groups in the last years. In addition to the continuous interest in the cultural, historic, ethnologic and archaeological aspects of this pigment, a debate has been opened on the structural and chemical aspects of this organo-clay pigment. This compound was synthesize in situ at the SNBL and investigated by Raman and XRPD. A mixture of indigo and palygorskite has been heated from room temperature to 200° C to allow the interaction between the colorant and the clay to form the Maya blue pigment. The heating process has been performed at in situ conditions monitoring the reaction by synchrotron radiation powder diffraction and RAMAN spectroscopy at the same time. The results show that main changes in the indigo molecular structure (revealed by RAMAN) occurred during the partial release of zeolitic water in the 80-120 C interval. The zeolitic water release in palygorskite is accompanied by a reduction of the a lattice parameter (XRPD data). This behaviour, similar in the indigo-palygorstite complex and in raw palygorskite, leads to the hypothesis that he indigo molecules are trapped at the entrance of the tunnels, and allows the understanding of the preparation process of this compound intersting the field of archeometry. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) In situ study of the thermal stability and degradation of hydrotalcite-based materials</head><p>Hydrotalcite (HTLc) based materials resulted interesting because of their inorganic nature and capability to intercalate various organic molecules into the layered structure. Various HTLC's containing lantanides and/or coumarin were synthesized and measure din situ from RT to 700K. XRPD data allowed to follow the contarction/expansion and destruction of the inorganic part, while Raman data gave information of the the transformation degradation and elimination of te horganic moieties. 6 A phase transition occurs at 363 K and the breaking of these interactions was observed. XRPD gave information on the long-range structural change while Raman gave information at the interaction level, by monitoring the vibrational model related to the moieties involve dinto these intecations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental report 2 September 2008</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ping-Yen Hsieh, Wouter van Beek, Pawel Zajdel and Mark Green</head><p>This central goal of this project was to study a series of lanthanide metal-organic framework materials by in-situ synchrotron X-ray and Raman spectroscopy, with the objective to elucidate the variation in chemical and physical properties as a function of (i) various kinds of f-orbital metals (ii) different molecular structures as a result of variable organic linkages such as benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC), 1, 3, 5-benzene-tricarboxylic acid (BTC) and 1, 3, 5 -tris(4carboxyphenyl)benzene (BTB).</p><p>We have determined the detailed crystal structures by single crystal X-ray diffractometer prior to the experiment so that we can focus on the thermal stability with and without gas loading. A summary of the experiments performed are given in the table below. Two example of this work are given below to highlight the opportunities offered with combined X-ray/Raman analysis to this field:</p><p>(A) Thermal Stability of Holmium Metal-Organic Frameworks as a Function of Organic Linker.</p><p>A comprehensive examination of various Ho-MOF systems with different ligands were evaluated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1~3</ref>.) and clearly demonstrates a higher temperature structure stability for Ho-MOF up to 250 o C with BTC ligand (fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) that is absent in the Ho-MOF with BDC and BTB systems. The stability of the structure is strongly influenced by the architecture between central metals and organic linkers. The origin of which is currently under investigation through the analysis of the X-ray and Raman patterns Figure 2. Ho-MOF-BTC molecular structure and XRD Figure 3. Ho-MOF-BTB molecular structure and XRD The collapse of the Ho-BTB at temperatures little over 100 °C, is in distinct contrast to the thermal stability displayed by related systems. Therefore, the project was extended with the examination of a number of different metal-organic framework systems under gas loading condition. The application of 20 bar of Ar pressure to the Ho -BTB structure dramatically improves the thermal stability. The origin is most likely the result of either (a) the suppression of the dehydration of the solvent molecules with the pores or (b) the exchange of the solvent molecules with Ar gas atoms holding the framework in a rigid fashion. The unique probe of combined X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy has proved to be an ideal method to investigate such systems.</p><p>5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 Intensity (Counts) 2 θ 28.64 o C 101.58 o C 197.96 o C 301.95 o C 399.53 o C 496.86 o C Ho_BTB_fresh_up to 500 o C_20bar_Ar 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 Ho_BTB_fresh_up to 150 o C_without_20bar_Ar Intensity (Counts) 2 θ 23.87 o C 101 o C 151.42 o C 1000 2000 3000 4000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 Raman Shift (cm -1 ) 28.64 o C 101.58 o C 163.05 o C In-Situ Raman Spectroscopy Ho_MOF_BTB_20bar Ar 1000 2000 3000 4000 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 In-Situ Raman Spectroscopy Ho_MOF_BTB_without 20bar Ar Intensity (Counts) Ramam Shift (cm -1 ) 23.87 o C 101 o C 164.4 o C 10 11 Summery of the project: Sample's name Process (Temperature and Pressure) Notes Goosecreekite at 1 atm, cooling down and heating up in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BTC at 1 atm, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BTC (degased) at 1, 5,10,14 bar of CO2, cooling to 215K then heating up to 400K CO2 absorption (in-situ Raman spctroscopy) Ho_MOF_BTC (degased) at 1,5,10,15,20 bar of Ar, cooling to 200K then heating up to 400K Ar absorption (in-situ Raman spctroscopy) Ho_MOF_BTC (degased) at 1,5,10,15,20 bar of CH 4 , cooling to 200K CH 4 absorption (in-situ Raman spctroscopy) Ho_MOF_BTB at 1 atm, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BTB (degased) at 1, 5,10,15,20 bar of Ar, cooling to 200K then heating up to 500 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BTB (degased) at 1, 5,10,14 bar of CO2, cooling to 215K then heating up (interrupt) in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BTB fresh sample at 20bar of Ar, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BDC fresh sample at 20bar of Ar, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BDC (degased) at 20bar of Ar, from room temperature then heating up (interrupt) in-situ structure and Raman variation Ho_MOF_BDC (degased) at 20bar of Ar, from room temperature then cooling down 200K in-situ structure and Raman variation Y_MOF_BTC at 1 atm, from room temperature to 600 o C (stop at 360 o C) in-situ structure and Raman variation Ce_MOF_BTC at 1 atm, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Pr_MOF_BTC at 1 atm, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Pr_MOF_BDC at 1 atm, from room temperature to 600 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation BaFeAs at 1 atm, cooling to 80K then heating to 300K in-situ structure and Raman variation CdCr2Se4 at 1 atm, cooling to 80K then heating to 400K in-situ structure and Raman variation FeSe875S125 at 1 atm, from150K cooling to 80K then heating up to 200K in-situ structure and Raman variation Na44 at 1 atm, from room temperature to 800 o C in-situ structure and Raman variation Zn05Mn05 at 1 atm, at 80K structure identification Zn09Mn01 at 1 atm, at 80K structure identification ZnCr 18 Ni 02 at 1 atm, at 80K structure identification Tm 77 X 28 at 1 atm, at 80K structure identification Fe12Se75S25 at 1 atm, at 80K structure identification Fe12Se875S125 at 1 atm, at 80K structure identification Mg_MOF at 1, 2, 5 bar of Ar, from room temperature to 420K in-situ structure and Raman variation NIST_MOF at 1 atm, room temperature structure identification Experimental report 3 Effect of high-pressure on the model perovskite SrTiO3: Investigation by combined Raman and X-ray scattering A. Bartasyte, R. Haumont, P. Bouvier, J. Kreisel, W. van Beek</p><p>The understanding of ABO 3 perovskite is an internationally highly-competitive area and among the most challenging topics at the interface between solid state chemistry and solid state physics. The ideal cubic Pm-3m structure of perovskite-type oxides is essentially simple, with corner-linked BO 6 octahedra, the B cations at the centre of the octahedra and the A-cations in the space of co-ordination 12 between the octahedra (Fig.  The understanding of phase transitions in perovskites induced by external parameters like temperature, pressure, strain, magneto-electric fields etc. remains of great interest. Compared to temperature, the external parameter high pressure is of particular interest since it acts only on interatomic distances and can be much easier simulated by potentially insightful ab-initio calculations.</p><p>In a seminal paper, Samara et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have proposed general rules for the effect of hydrostatic pressure on displacive phase transitions associated with soft zone-center ferroelectric and zone-boundary antiferrodistortive instabilities. Two striking effects have been proposed and experimentally confirmed: (i) the decrease of the ferroelectric transition temperature with pressure and ultimate vanishing of ferroelectricity. (ii) the phase transition temperatures of antiferrodistortive zone-boundary transitions in perovskites increase with pressure, i.e. the angle of octahedra tilts increases with pressure.</p><p>The above general rules have shown to be extremely successful and have guided research in the field for 30 years. The aim of our experiment was to challenge Samara's longstanding rules for the model perovskite SrTiO 3 (STO) which adopts at ambient conditions the ideal cubic Pm-3m perovskite structure. In the present experiment we have been aiming at answering the following questions: (i) does STO remains cubic under highpressure, or does high-pressure induce phase transitions? and, if yes, (ii) do the potential phase transitions follow Samara rules or not? Finally, (iii) does STO develop ferroelectricity at high-pressure, as was recently suggested for all d 0 transition metal oxides? Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been in the past a useful probe for the investigation of pressure-induced phase transitions in other perovskites. However, XRD suffers from the fact that 1) oxygen-dominated superstructure reflections, coming from a cell doubling due to oxygen octahedra tilting have only a low intensity (the smaller the tilting the smaller the intensity) and 2) that phase transitions via only small changes in the metric of the unit cell ask for a good resolution to depict a potential splitting of Bragg reflections. In order to address these limitations we have aimed in the present experiment to combine XRD with Raman scattering which is known to be a complementary and versatile probe for the detection of even subtle phase transitions in perovskites.</p><p>In order to answer the above questions, we have loaded a (001) oriented single crystal into a high-pressure diamond anvil cell. In order to fit to the small (∅ = 150 µm) highpressure cell in the gasket, the sample has been preliminarily polished down to a thickness of 15 µm and only a small piece with a lateral extension of 40 µm was used for the experiment to provide best hydrostatic conditions. A single crystal sample has been preferred to a powder in anticipation that superstructure reflections are easier to detect in a single crystal pattern than in a powder diffraction pattern which inherently presents a higher background at a given integrated diffraction angle θ. At the same time a laser beam was directed via a fibre to the diamond anvil cell and focused with a long working distance objective through the diamonds to the small single crystal sitting in the gasket. We would like to point out that the Raman set-up has been working remarkably well and has needed very little alignment for the acquisition of the spectra. Also the change from the Raman to the XRD measurements was quick and reliably.</p><p>The beside Figure shows a number of representative Raman spectra obtained for selected pressures. It can be seen that the spectral signature changes significantly with applied pressure as exemplified by the appearance at about 13 GPa of a new band around 600 cm -1 or the mode hardening of the intense and sharp band at low wavenumbers. These and other more subtle spectral changes indicate that STO undergoes at two phase transitions in the investigated pressure-range up to 25 GPa. Although these spectra provide clear evidence for phase transitions, the Raman scattering data does not allow proposing the character of the pressure-induced symmetries and even less a specific space group.</p><p>Aiming to understand the underlying structural mechanism in more detail we undertaken a detailed analysis of the obtained single crystal diffraction pattern which have been obtained in a rotating crystal geometry (pattern not shown here). Unfortunately, the analysis of the diffraction pattern at different pressures did not allow detecting neither superstructure reflections (expected for cell doubling) nor the splitting of the fundamental cubic Bragg reflections which we expected to provide evidence for metric changes to discover the structural parameters. From this we conclude the following: 1) Potential superstructure reflections have to be weak thus indicating an only small angle of octahedra tilting and 2) the metric structural distortion has also to be small. On the experimental side it would be certainly helpful to be able to work with a smaller wavelength of 0.5 Å. This should allow increasing the resolution of the diffraction pattern significantly which in turn should allow the observation of metric symmetry changes.</p><p>200 400 600 800 1000 1200 25 GPa 21 GPa 20 GPa 17 GPa 16 GPa 14 GPa 13 GPa 11 GPa I (a.u.) ω (cm -1 )</p></div>
