<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Noble gases and their isotopes are important traces for the formation and evolution of the Earth and its atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, their storage at depth are still debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The solubility of noble gases in crystalline lower mantle phases at high P/T conditions is therefore a key parameter necessary to evaluate the noble gas storage capacity of the Earth's mantle. We have recently performed an in-situ XAS experiment on the solubility of Kr into iron-alloys and its partitioning between metallic iron and (Mg1-x,Fex)O to simulate the earliest conditions of Earth's core formation . The results of this previous experiment and part of the present ones have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. In this work(s), we could show based on analysis of the quenched samples (elemental concentrations and Kr-K edge XAS data) and thermodynamic modelling that (Mg1-x,Fex)O, the second most abundant phase of the Earth's lower mantle, exhibits a high storage capacity for noble gases and might thus be a likely host at depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID24 run:</head><p>We have conducted additional in-situ high P/T experiments on the energy dispersive EXAFS beamline ID24 of the ESRF in order to complement this previous results and to investigate the noble gas incorporation mechanism in-situ at high P/T. The uptake of the noble gases Ne, Ar and Kr in Fe, FeO and (Mg1-x,Fex)O were investigated between 35 and 85 GPa and temperatures up to 2500 K using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell and the set-up installed at ID24 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The energy of the beamline was tuned to the iron absorption edge (7.112 keV). The incorporation of noble gases was deduced from the edge position change that is directly related to the inter-atomic distance. Our previous results <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> revealed that noble gases should be incorporate in oxygen vacancies of (Mg1-x,Fex)O. This mechanism would directly affect the local atomic environment of the next-nearest neighbour iron atom and therefore should be detectable at this edge. In order to monitor these subtitle changes in the absorption edge-position we used a Si(311) polychromator crystals that provides the highest energy resolution. In this optical configuration ID24 offers a highly focused beam (7x5 μm 2 ) at the Fe K-edge compatible with stable and uniform laser heating. The reduction in flux required the use of samples with a higher iron content than previously foreseen (pure FeO and Fe).</p><p>Prior to the heating runs, we acquired a set of high-quality high pressure data on FeO contained in neon up to 40 GPa (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This data set serves as a reverence to interpret the high P/T data. We have successfully performed 18 heating runs in a pressure and temperature range of 30-85 GPa and 1500-2500 K. Heating durations ranged between 15 and 30 minutes to ensure equilibrium reactions. During heating XAS data were acquired every minute, with an acquisition time of 10 ms per spectrum and a number of 20 spectra that were accumulated in order to improve the data quality. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> an example of a set of in-situ Fe K-edge spectra acquired during laser-heating is shown for krypton incorporation into a compressed pellet of FeO that has been placed on a KCl disked. In the first 6 minutes of the heating run at 2000 K and 35 GPa the spectra show no changes (blue and red spectra). Upon further heating important changes in the pre-edge and edge region are observed that include a change of the pre-edge region (7115 eV) possibly indicating an oxidation of Fe 2+ to more Fe 3+ in FeO, which could be related to the formation of neutral oxygen vacancies as Schottky defects and the incorporation of Kr. Moreover, the shape of the white line changes: It develops a more pronounced shoulder at 7125 eV and the second XANES peak vanishes (green spectrum compared to the red or blue). These changes are also manifested in the spectrum acquired after T quenched (violet spectrum). This suggest a non-reversible change of the local environment of iron during the heating run and possibly linked to the incorporation of krypton.</p><p>7075 7100 7125 7150 7175 7200 7225 7250 Normalized absorption (a.u.)

The results will provide the first in-situ observations on the incorporation of noble gases in oxide phases at lower mantle conditions and a validation of the proposed mechanism in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Moreover, the data will allow to derive information on the diffusion of noble gases at lower mantle conditions which remain presently completely unconstrained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BM23 run</head><p>Originally we planned to investigate the incorporation mechanism of krypton and xenon in the laser-heated samples maintained at high pressure using EXAFS at BM23. The time-span between the two beamtimes (November-February) was however too long to reserve the cells for the measurements. Therefore we have used the beamtime at BM23 to investigated the compression behaviour of xenon up to 150 GPa from EXAFS and XRD, which is similarly important to deduce their incorporation mechanism in lower Earth's mantle phases. For the experiments, the X-ray beam was tuned to the energy of the Xe K-edge (34.5 keV) using a double-crystal fixed exit monochromator equipped with two Si(311) crystals. Beam focusing to 6 × 6 μm 2 and harmonic rejection was achieved through a Kirkpatrick Baez mirror system with Pt coating inclined to 2 mrad. EXAFS data up to a k-range of 16 Å -1 were acquired in transmission mode using ionchambers filled with a gas mixture of krypton and nitrogen in appropriate proportions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). XRD data were acquired in the sample and on the Re gasket for pressure calibration at 34 keV using a MARCCD detector. The EXAFS data analysis has now been finalized and revealed important changes of the compression mechanism in xenon as previously observed for krypton from XRD and XANES <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We have also analysed krypton EXAFS data acquired at ID24 (ES-435) and compared the results to those obtained on xenon. For both phases we observed compression anomalies with increasing volume fraction of the hcp phase. These anomalies are more pronounced at a local scale (seen by XAS) as those observed in the bulk lattice from XRD data. The results are currently compiled and close to submission to the journal Physical Review B.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
