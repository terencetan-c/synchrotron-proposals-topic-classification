<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>.-</p><p>We have a long term research project on the study of the high frequency dynamics in liquid water and other hydrogen bonded molecular liquids 11). The present report gives a iimt overview on the new results obtained during the last Run in Dec. 97 on the inelastic x-ray scattering beamline. The main aim of this experiment was the detemination of the temperature Q and momentum transfer (Q) dependences of the transition from low to f&amp;t sound in liquid water. These measurements, continuing a previous attempt in a limited pressure (P) and T regions, show that this transition in liquid water corresponds to a structural relaxation proceea substantially similar to that typically found in glass-forming systems.</p><p>Specifically, the transition between the two dynamical behavior presents a phenomenology like the one observed for the structural a-relaxation. The relevance of the result reported here is that the time-scale of this relaxation process is in the picosecond range, while, for typical glassformers, the relaxation time ie at the nanosecond level in the melting temperature region. Moreover, contrary to glass-formers, liquid water does not have a transition to a glassy phase. Consequently, our findings generalize the physics of the a-relaxation showing that it is a specific feature of the liquid-phase in liquids with a high degree of local orientational order, and its obervation is not @?icient to grant the formation of a glass.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> we present a set of inelastic x-ray scattering qkctra taken at Q=4 rim-l at d&amp;rent temper-ature&amp; These data were measured at constant density, ~1 g/cmS, using a high pressure/temperature cell that we developed explicitely for this experimental program. This cell stands up to 5 kbar and 400 C. Similar data were taken also at other Q values (2 and 7 nm-l) in the 20~300 C T-region with a 20 C temperaturre grid. The data were fitted using standard procedures using a damped harmonic oscillator to represent the inelastic signal. The central frequency, n,(Q), obtained from the fit, is reported for three diffmt temperatures in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> aa a function of Q. We 0bserve that the transition from one mund velocity to the other ie found at an increased Q value for ~~~ing temperature.</p><p>Therefore, as in the a relaxation, in glass forming systems, the velocity of sound at a given Q value changes between its infinity (~00) and zero frequency (c,,) values at a well defined temperature: this temperature is associated to a specific value of the relaxation time r(Q, T) by a relation approximately given by cQ~=l, with c = (c, +c,,)/2. The velocities of sounds scaled to G, i. e. fZ(Q)/c,,Q, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> as a function of temperature at three different values of Q. Here, we clearly see again that the largest sound velocity dispersion is found at increasing Q values with increasing temperature. Using the relation between 7 and c, we estimate a value of 7 ranging from 2 ps at -30 C to 0.6 pa at 150 C. An improved data analysis is at present being developed to increase the statistical,accuracy of these deteminations. The direct experimental determination of a structural relaxation time, with its temperature dependence (i) at such high frequencies, in (iii, a liquid a8 important as water, and (tii) in such an extended P, T, and Q ranges haa two very important implications. The first point is that the structural relaxation time is very likely to correspond to the lifetime of tetrahedrally coordinated units of Ha0 molecules, induced by the presence of the hydrogen bond. The dynamics is therefore very different whether the considered momentum and frequency are either higher or lower than the size and lifetime of these units. In the long wavelength case, water behaves as a continuum and its density fluctuations reflects average properties well described within the hydrodynamic picture. In the other case, when the wavelength is small compared to size of these units, the density fluctuations strongly reflects the local order among molecules, and the dynamics become like the one of solid ice. The second one is connected to the Maxwell equation relating 7(T) to the macroscopic viscosity q(T). Consequently, this study, which relates 7(T) to the lifetime of tetrahedrally coordinated units of water molecules, implies that environment. These results start to give a satisfactory picture on the dynamics of hydrogen bonded liquids, and on the effect of highly directional bonding on liquid properties. It will be very important, however, to continue these studies in water up and above the critical point (360 C), where kinetic effect are expected to overcome the hydrogen bond even at these high frequencies, and in other hydrogen bonded liquids (methane, methanol, ammonia and fluoridric acid), where the strength of the hydrogen bond can be effectively modified. These will be the directions were we would like to concentrate our future efforts.</p></div>		</body>
