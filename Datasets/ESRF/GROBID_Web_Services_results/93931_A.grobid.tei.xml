<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>2. CeO2 interaction with simulated lung fluids CeO2 NPs of 2 and 5 nm were stored in multicomponent media, which are models of lung fluids: simulated lung fluid (SLF) and Gamble's solution. Analysis of the HERFD spectra from CeO2 2 nm sample reveals the partial reduction of the initial Се(IV) to Се(III) in case of SLF and Gamble media (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). In Gamble's solution, the Ce(III) generation process is faster, probably, due to the presence of glycine -the reduction agent -in the Gamble solution. In a sample with an initial particle size of 5 nm, the maximum from Ce(III) in the absorption pre-edge region is hardly distinguished. This indicates slower kinetics of interaction of 5 nm NPs in comparison to 2 nm with components of simulated lung solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Interaction with fetal bovine serum in cell culture media</head><p>According to HERFD, after storage of a 2 nm CeO2 sample in CCM+PBS medium, all Ce(IV) in sample is reduced to Ce(III) oxidation state. In a sample with an initial particle size of 5 nm, cerium is partially reduced to Ce(III) state. CeO2 NPs with initial size 8 nm nanoparticles did not change after interaction with serum. Thus, the changes observed in systems depend on the particle size. All samples after HERFD measurements were also analyzed by XRD, XFR and microscopy methods to understand the Ce(III) peak's origins in spectra. CeO2 to cerium phosphate phase transformations after interaction with solutions of biological meaning was revealed. The structure, morphology and size of generated cerium phosphates depend on initial NPs size (surface-to-volume ratio) and the presence of reducing agents in the systems. Ce L3 edge spectra were also collected during in-situ reactions of CeO2 NPs interaction with a solution of biological meaning in specially constructed cells. There were no significant changes in the cerium spectra during in-situ measurements conducted for 12 -48 hours. Therefore, the process of redox-mediated phase transformation occurs in more than 48 hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Interaction with cells (mouse fibroblasts)</head><p>To study the antioxidant properties of CeO2 in living cells, generally, the NPs additionally stabilize in solution by adding citrate-contained compound. However, at the moment, there is no data on citrate effect on the structure of CeO2 particles and cerium oxidation state in such stable colloids. Within the framework of this project, a citrate-stabilized CeO2 colloid was analyzed by HERFD. We measured CeO2 colloidal solution and additionally separate solid from that. The solid phase was separated from the solution by ultrafiltration with 3kD filters. It is shown that the spectra of the colloid and the separated solid phase are different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>). However, The preedge structure for separated CeO2 solid and colloid reveals solely the presence of the Ce(IV) oxidation state. After interaction with fibroblasts cells during the day, the formation of Ce(III) in the system is not observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>).</p><p>Based on the presented data, at least three articles are being prepared for publication.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2.
