<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We also observed a Ku -Dnl4 complex with an acceptable resolutionof 4 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). As the data set is heterogeneous (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>), the aim is to continue this work by i) obtaining a homogeneous data set for Ku dimers, ii) improving the resolution for Ku -Dnl4 complex to be able to determine with certainty the precise interaction zones in the two proteins and iii) carrying out a session with the aim of obtaining the entire NHEJ synapse thanks to the biochemical improvements we have recently made using the grafix system. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: Molecular mechanisms underlying the prominent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway, the NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Vincent MORIN, PhD student, and Paloma FERNANDEZ VARELA, Research Engineer Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC) -UMR9198 Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology (B3S) Our previous request for rolling acces for cryo electron microscopy concerns a project to characterise the molecular mechanisms underlying the prominent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway, the NHEJ (Non Homologous End Joining) in budding yeast S. cerevisiae. In this model system, we are trying to obtain a synapse complex consisting of Ku, Lif1-Dnl4 and Nej1 proteins (Fig.1A) along the lines of what was obtained in 2021 on the publications by Chen and Chaplin (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-021-03458-7 and DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2021.07.005). CryoEM tests were first carried out as part of the thesis project of Vincent MORIN, which produced encouraging initial volumes thank to the time requested at the ESRF (MX2519 session). During this session, 11,000 images were recorded then and processed by Vincent MORIN in our institute at the CEA Saclay. The results are quite satisfactory and have enabled us to characterise Ku on DNA in form of monomer or dimers, which could open up a field of study concerning the dynamics of this protein-DNA interaction. The resolutions obtained are 2.7 Å for Ku -DNA monomer (Fig.1B), and lower for the dimers.</figDesc></figure>
