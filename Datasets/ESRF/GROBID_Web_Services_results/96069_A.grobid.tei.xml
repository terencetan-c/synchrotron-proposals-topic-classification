<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p>The aim of this beamtime was to determine the stability of palladium carbide and palladium nitride under different gas environments. These interstitial structures are formed in situ during catalytic reactions, for example ammonia oxidation and acetylene hydrogenation. Recent evidence suggests that the lifetime of these species is sufficient to allow them to be explored as possible catalysts for other reactions where they cannot be formed in situ.</p><p>To select which reactions these species would be suitable for, the conditions under which they are stable needed to be determined, which involved exposing them to oxidizing, reducing and inert conditions during a temperature ramp using a custom in situ cell at the Pd L3 and K edge. An example experimental profile is given in figure X. We aimed to switch between the K edge (24keV) and the L3 edge (3keV) at each temperature point, however decided to do the full experiment at the L3 edge due to challenges that arose during the beamtime. This proved to be sufficient to get the information we needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The cell</head><p>The in situ cell was custom designed by Paul Thompson, beamline scientist at BM28. (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) Its special design allows collection of both transmission (ion chamber) and fluorescence (SDD) data simultaneously. Due to the low energy of the Pd L3 edge (3keV), a helium atmosphere was required to prevent the loss of x-rays to absorption by air. The cell was therefore mounted in a helium filled chamber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We successfully formed the PdCx, PdHx and PdNx in situ for one catalyst, 1.5% Pd/Al2O3. (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) We showed that the XANES at the L3 edge is sufficiently sensitive to changes in the Pd structure to differentiate the carbide, hydride and nitride from Pd(0) and PdO. This shift in the position of the white line from Pd(0) suggests structural changes due to the incorporation of heteroatoms into the Pd lattice. We observed the characteristic 2p ïƒ  Pd-H antibonding peak at 3182eV for PdHx. We found that the edge jump is more intense for PdCx, however the carbide and nitride are virtually indistinguishable in terms of spectral features and energy shift. This is expected due to the similar size of C and N. Figure 3 XANES of Pd(0), PdCx, PdNx and PdHx on 1.5% Pd/Al2O3 formed in situ at Pd L3 edge Figure 2 Schematic of in situ flow cell Beamtime Report February 2022</p><p>We determined that PdNx appear to have a range of stability under Helium of 120-140 o C (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), whereas it decomposed upon hydrogen insertion in the atmosphere. Pd at the L3 edge pre and post nitride formation were different. (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) Previous work suggests that the inclusion and removal of carbon into the Pd lattice is reversible. We now aim to establish what causes these differences.</p><p>We also found that the formation of PdNx appear to be sensitive to metal loading. We have previously found a high support dependence, but the metal loading is suggestive of a relationship between the Pd nanoparticle size and the achievability of nitrogen insertion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Challenges</head><p>The upper lid of the cell was comprised of PEEK, which, when reaching the high temperature required for PdCx formation and degradation (&gt;200 o C) caused a deformation. This resulted in a lack of seal applied to the sample which resulted in the sample being displaced and not being hit by the beam. This problem was not identified in first instance as it was only realized observing the lid against a brand new one. This caused a few hours losses in collection due to trying to solve the problem.</p><p>When collecting data at the Pd K edge (24keV) the presence of the Pt HR mirrors caused an extreme drop in flux. These mirrors were required in order to switch between K edge and L3 edge but we decided to remove when collecting K edge data in order to improve signal quality. We also had issues at the K edge with the hourly beam refill. Intensity dropped significantly, possibly due to the low counts due to other issues at that energy. (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) We therefore decided to proceed with the L3 edge only. EXAFS at the L3 edge is not possible due to the proximity to the L2 edge (200eV above) and the low energy of the emitted photoelectron.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solutions</head><p>We intend to work with Paul on BM28 to adapt the lid to incorporate an inflexible aluminum component, preventing distortions. Beamline scientists are running further tests at the Pd K edge to ensure it will be usable for future beamtimes. We have provided samples and reference spectra to aid with this.
