<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The spin moments of the layered ternary compounds SmMn 2 Ge 2 , GdMn 2 Ge 2 and LaMn 2 Ge 2 were measured on the high energy beamline ID15A using the magnetic Compton scattering technique. Our earlier results of measurements made on SmMn 2 Ge 2 using magnetic Compton scattering (ID15A -IHR time) showed large spin and orbital moments present in the low temperature ferromagnetic phase (&lt;105K), whilst the existence of a Sm 4f spin moment was observed for the first time in the high temperature ferromagnetic phase (155K to 345K). These earlier results will be published as a Rapid Communication in Phys. Rev. B 62 (September 1 st 2000). For the present experiment HE780, the aims were firstly to measure the magnetic Compton profiles (MCP) of GdMn 2 Ge 2 (no 4f orbital moment) in order to understand the effect on the moment of spin-orbit coupling, and LaMn 2 Ge 2 (no 4f moment at all) to determine the extent to which the Mn moment governs the magnetic behaviour. Secondly we aimed to make a systematic temperature study of the moments present in SmMn 2 Ge 2 . This compound is one example of naturally layered materials where the magnetic ordering depends critically on the Mn-Mn separation. For values above 2.87Å the compounds are ferromagnetic and below it they are antiferromagnetic. In SmMn 2 Ge 2 the spacing is close to this borderline value and it is not surprising that it exhibits both re-entrant ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, the latter in the range 105-155K. It also shows GMR behaviour although with an opposite sign to the norm. Understanding its magnetic behaviour is of clear relevance to studies of artificial multi-layered GMR materials. The MCPs of GdMn 2 Ge 2 and LaMn 2 Ge 2 were measured at 15K and the spin moments present on the Gd and Mn sites in GdMn 2 Ge 2 and on the Mn sites in LaMn 2 Ge 2 were determined. The MCPs are shown in Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Unfortunately, due to an obscure error in the data collection program written for us at the ESRF the data for one of the magnetic field directions was repeatedly overwritten rather than summed in the raw datafile. This was not discovered until near the end of the experiment, the statistical errors were poor and measuring times were subsequently much longer than would otherwise have been necessary. Consequently, only one temperature was measured for SmMn 2 Ge 2 (it is planned to resubmit a proposal in order to complete the systematic temperature study). The MCP of SmMn 2 Ge 2 measured at 230K along the c-axis (easy magnetic direction) is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The data can be analysed in terms of Mn 3d and Sm and Gd 4f orbitals. At large momenta the spin resolved Compton profile must be well fitted by free atom modelling of the momentum density. This fact arises from the following energy considerations: the second moment of the Compton profile is proportional to the kinetic energy of the system and, via the virial theorem, the total energy. The small energy differences between free atom and solid that result in cohesion are necessarily associated with the low momentum region of the profile (p z &lt; 1.5 a.u.). This means that the high momentum region can be analysed confidently in terms of free atom Compton profiles. The Compton profile of a Sm 4f electron is some 50% broader than that of a Mn 3d electron and thus the MCP can be uniquely analysed at high momentum in terms of the 4f and 3d contributions. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the decomposition of the data by this method (the other figures show only the final fit, not the individual contributions). The total spin moments, as well as the individual 4f and 3d contributions for each of the three samples are given in the table. Combination of total spin moments measured here and bulk magnetisation measurements currently being made at Warwick University will allow us to determine the orbital moment present in each compound. Magnetic moments [µ B ] LaMn 2 Ge 2 at 15K GdMn 2 Ge 2 at 15K SmMn 2 Ge 2 at 230K Total spin +2.7(1) +3.6(1) +2.2(1) 4f spin -+8.3(1) -0.9(1) 3d + delocalised spin +2.7(1) -4.7(1) +3.1(1)</p><p>Immediate conclusions are that firstly, we once again observe the presence of a Sm 4f moment in the high temperature phase for SmMn 2 Ge 2 , confirming the findings of our earlier experiment. The fit at high momenta is only good if a Sm 4f moment is included. This moment is of similar size at 230K when the external field is aligned both parallel (easy direction, -0.9µ B ) and perpendicular to the c-axis (-0.7µ B ). It is the Mn sublattice which hardens considerably (3d + delocalised moment decreases from 3.1µ B to ~1µ B ). Secondly, in GdMn 2 Ge 2 , the Gd 4f moment is aligned parallel to the total spin moment, and antiparallel to the Mn 3d moment. The Mn 3d moment is much larger in GdMn 2 Ge 2 than for La or Sm. First analysis implies that this is due to the Mn spins being canted in LaMn 2 Ge 2 and SmMn 2 Ge 2 , but aligning along the field direction in GdMn 2 Ge 2 . When canted, only their projections along the external magnetic field direction are measured. Lastly, the free atom fit to the LaMn 2 Ge 2 data confirm that there is no 4f moment present. Further analysis is now necessary to determine the effect of spin-orbit coupling, and to identify exactly the non-4f contribution using the LaMn 2 Ge 2 data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.
