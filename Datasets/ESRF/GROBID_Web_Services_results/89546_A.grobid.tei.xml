<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the impact of the confinement size and the pH on the sorption kinetics of various electrolyte solutions on parallel plane silica surfaces spaced of few nanometer (nanochannels 2 and 4 nm) using hard X-Ray reflectivity <ref type="bibr">(27 keV)</ref>. For this purpose we used several salt solutions XCl2 (X = Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) at different concentrations (0.2 -1 M) and pH values (pH 2 and 8) in order to investigate the influence of ions having more or less kosmotropic property. From the electron density profiles obtained, the filling kinetics of these nanochannels and the validity of conceptual models used to decribe the diffusive layer can be studied. Moreover, the experimental results will be compared to the results obtain by atomisitc modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample preparation</head><p>Nanochannels (2 and 4 nm) were dried in a vacuum oven at 200 °C for 3 days in order to determine the electron density profile of the dried samples. Subsequently the nanochannels were immersed in electrolyte solution XCl2 ((X = Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ ) at different concentrations (0.2 -1 M) and different pH values (pH 2 and 8) and the X-Ray reflectivity was measured after different times and at several distances from the edge to get information about the filling kinetics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hard X-Ray reflectivity measurements</head><p>All the samples were fixed in a specific cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and measured in dried state. Subsequently the cell was filled with the appropriated salt solutions. Regarding the long term experiments the nanochannels were immersed in electrolyte solution. Measurements were performed from -0.2 &lt; θ &lt; 3. Scans were taken every 10 minutes until there were no more visible changes between reflectivity curves. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The nanochannels were measured in a dried state and afterwards filled with water and electrolyte solution. Since beam time was the consecution of a previous experiment, we show the long-term kinetics of nanochannels-filling during 8 months in solution having two different concentrations (0.2 and 1 M) and at neutral pH. Furthermore, we studied the impact of the pH on the filling kinetics. The following graphs (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>) highlight the reflectivity data as a function of the channel size and at two different pH values. The pH dependent measurements were performed during 8 days of immersion in 1 M solutions. CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions were only measured at a neutral solution pH and pH at 8.</p><p>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 Four 1mm Four 5mm Four 10mm 4days1mm 4days 5mm 4days 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 4 nm water pH8 (a) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 (b) four four four 4days 1mm 4days 5mm 4days 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 2 nm water pH8 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 (c) Four 1mm Four 5mm Four 10mm 4days1mm 4days 5mm 4days 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 4 nm water pH2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 (d) four four four 4days 1mm 4days 5mm 4days 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 2 nm water pH2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 (e) 4 nm water IQ4Empty1mm IQ4Empty5mm IQ4Empty10mm IQ41M1mm IQ41M5mm IQ41M10mm 4mois 1mm 4mois 5mm 4mois 10mm 6mois 1mm 6mois 5mm 6mois 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 10 -5 (f) four four four 1semaine 1mm 1semaine 5mm 1semaine 10mm 4mois 1mm 4mois 5mm 4mois 10mm 6mois 1mm 6mois 5mm 6mois 10mm 8mois 1mm 8mois 5mm 8mois 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 2 nm water Figure 3: X-Ray Reflectivity curves obtained for water in different sizes of nanochannels (2 and 4 nm).

However, for BaCl2 in 4 nm nanochannels an evolution was detected corresponding to a continuing filling of the channels. The pH dependent measurements revealed that there is indeed an impact of the pH on the filling kinetics. Assuming more deprotonated silanol groups at the nanochannels surface for pH8, the filling is accelerated compared to pH2. The same results were found for CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions except for the 2 nm nanochannels. The reflectivity within the 2 nm channels decreased after 8 months indicating that the filling process is still not finished. The differences can be explained by the different ion radii.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I/I0 q (A -1 )</formula><p>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 Four1mm Four5mm Four10mm 8 jours1mm 8 jours5mm 8 jours10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 4nm MgCl2 1M pH8 (a) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 (b) Four1mm Four5mm Four10mm 8 jours1mm 8 jours5mm 8 jours10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 2nm MgCl2 1M pH8 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 10 -5 Four1mm Four5mm Four10mm 1semaine 1mm 1semaine 5mm 1semaine 10mm 4 mois 1mm 4 mois 5mm 4 mois 10mm 6 mois 1mm 6 mois 5mm 6 mois 10mm 8 mois 1mm 8 mois 5mm 8 mois 10mm (c) I/I0 q (A -1 ) 4nm MgCl2 1M pH 5.8 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 10 -5 Four1mm Four5mm Four10mm 1semaine1mm 1semaine5mm 1semaine10mm 4 mois 1mm 4 mois 5mm 4 mois 10mm 6 mois 1mm 6 mois 5mm 6 mois 10mm 8 mois 1mm 8 mois 5mm 8 mois 10mm I/I0 q (A -1 ) 2nm MgCl2 1M pH 5.8 (d) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Generally, reflectivity measurements during the filling of nanochannels with various electrolyte solutions at different concentrations and pH values revealed that the filling kinetics are dependent on several parameters. Regarding our short-term kinetics at different pH values, we observed an accelerated filling at higher pH values. Moreover, the filling of 4 nm nanochannels is faster than for 2 nm. The time required to fill the channels is longer for Ba than for Ca and Mg. Eventually, it would be interesting to analyze the pH dependent samples at a long-term in order to emphasize the pH dependent kinetics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The AFM image shows the well-defined channels in this experiments having a height of 2 and 4 nm.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,180.60,287.76,253.44,151.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
