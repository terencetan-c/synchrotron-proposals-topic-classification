<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The martensitic transformation of 12 mol% ceria-doped tetragonal zirconia micropillars (MPs) was followed by in-situ compression combined with Laue microdiffraction at the BM32 beamline. To perform it, the following proceedings were done ahead of the experiment:</p><p>First, 12 mol% ceria-doped zirconia pellets were sintered at 1600 ºC for 10 hours dwell time. The high temperature and sintering time were used to facilitate the growth of large grains with sizes of up to 8 µm needed for the subsequent micro-machining of single-crystalline micropillars. Electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD, Symmetry, Oxford Instruments) was performed after cutting the pellets into triangular-shaped pieces, and preparing the surface with low-energy milling (Ilion II, Gatan), reducing surface damage and preventing premature phase transformation. These steps are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> -Processing steps for micropillars processing, starting from bulk material, followed by broad beam polishing and EBSD grain selection previous to FIB milling.</p><p>During the deformation of ceria stabilized tetragonal zirconia, three deformation behaviors compete with each other: transformation, slip, and fracture. The martensitic transformation is likely to be affected by the crystal orientation 1 . The main criterium of the crystalline orientation of the grains selected for the preparation of the micropillars was the Schmid factor SF. For calculating SF, the tetragonal supercell faces ( ! " ≈ 1, 𝑃4 % 𝑚2) were used as slip planes. After selecting the grains with crystalline orientations favoring the martensitic transformation, micropillars were milled out of the bulk material using a focused ion beam microscope (FIB, Zeiss NVision 40). In this experiment, two different pillar sizes were tested, one with an aspect ratio (height/diameter) around 2.5 -3 ("P" pillars), and another with an aspect ratio around 4 ("C" pillars). The orientation for each P pillar is presented in the inverse pole figure displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The Euler angles shown here are according to the primitive tetragonal unit cell (𝑃4 # /𝑛𝑚𝑐 ), to be comparable with the Laue microdiffraction indexation results. It is emphasized here that the relation between both cells is  Table <ref type="table">1</ref> -Euler angles (E1, E2, E3) of pillars processed for the BM32 in situ compression experiment. Pillars noted as "P" had a starting tetragonal phase. Pillars M1 and M2 were completely and partially monoclinic, respectively. The Euler angles correspond to the primitive (𝑃4 ! /𝑛𝑚𝑐) tetragonal phase orientation. The maximum Schmid factors (𝑆𝐹 "#$ ) were calculated based on the supercell configuration.</p></div>

During compression in displacementcontrolled mode with a displacement rate of 30 nm/s, Laue microdiffraction patterns were recorded using a sCMOS camera installed at 90° with respect to the incident polychromatic X-ray beam. Cyclic loadingunloading curves with increasing maximum load were applied to each micropillar until a clear load drop was visible in the load-displacement curve. 2D Laue microdiffraction maps were recorded of the micropillars both in their pristine state and after compression. The Laue microdiffraction patterns were indexed using the LaueTools software and the LaueTools neural network (newly developed by the BM32 beamline staff) which allowed to deduce the monoclinic and tetragonal crystalline phases, the crystalline orientation, and the deviatoric strain for each measurement position within the 2D Laue microdiffraction maps.</p><p>The calculated maximum stresses obtained from the load-dipalcement curves for all mechanically tested micropillars are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. It should be noted that pillars P3, P5, and P7 could not be precisely located, thus were not tested.</p><p>Due to a slight taper, the diameter of the micropillars increases from the top towards the bottom. The effecive diameter of the deformed zone was calculated¹ using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑑 '11 = 6 1 3 𝑑 ,2&amp; # + 𝑑 ,2&amp; # 𝑑 32, # + 𝑑 32, #<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Where 𝑑 ,2&amp; and 𝑑 32, are the top and bottom diameters of the transformed region, respectively. From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the maximum stresses calculated differ between the pillars due to their different orientations. For instance, pillars P2 and P8 (orientation ≈ [001]) exhibited a higher mechanical strength for inducing the transformation compared to pillars P6 and P10. This could be linked to the difference in Schmid factors. While the first two have a 𝑆𝐹 ./0 close to zero, the latter two are 0.38 and 0.50 respectively. In addition, for P1 even though the 𝑆𝐹 ./0 is 0.33, the maximum stress is the highest. Therefore, a more in-depth view of the mechanical behavior for transformation is needed. Scanning electron microcopy images and phase maps of the micropillar P6 before and after compression are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> together with the load-displacement curve showing a clearly visible load drop.</p><p>P1 P2 P6 P8 P10 M2 C1 C2 C3 C4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</p><p>Maximum Stress (GPa)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pillars</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> -Pristine and compressed state of pillar P1. The laue spot images were obtained using the lauetools software by using as input the data obtained during the experiment. The 2D maps were obtained using the lauetools neural network software, where the material index and matching rate are highlighted here. On the material index, green color means tetragonal phase, while yellow is monoclinic phase.</p><p>In Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the load drop can be observed around ~7 GPa. Analysing the material index map, it is clear that phase transformation was induced during the in situ compression test. Nevertheless, an important question that must be solved is if the transformation occurred before fracture, or the contrary. This is an important result, as it can lead us to better understand how the transformation onset, and can help in tailoring the materials properties in order to obtain transformation only, rather than fracture. Moreover, pillars where only transformation occurred were also observed, such as Pillar P6 (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> in the annex).</p><p>From these preliminary results, the martensitic transformation was observed even for orientations that were believed to not favor the transformation, where the compression axis // crystal orientation. Some of the SEM images recorded after mechanical testing show cracks, raising the point of competition between transformation, slip, and fracture. If pillars "P" and "C" are compared, the latter presented higher maximum stresses. This can be related to the different aspect ratios and different crystalline orientations. In addition, misalignments may also affect the mechanical test, causing sample bending.</p><p>With this experiment, knowing the corresponding cell variant from the tetragonal→monoclinic transformation is possible, and will aid in understanding how the transformation is preferred for the 12 mol% ceria-doped zirconia. The next steps involve a time-resolved experiment to have a better resolution of when the transformation occurs along the stress-strain curve, and evaluation of by-crystalline micropillars to understand how the transformation propagates between grains. Figure 11 -Pillar P9 pristine and compressed state. Scanning electron microscope images, and laue maps acquired using lauenn are used here to represent the martensitic transformation. A zirconia particle was present during mechanical testing, thus the pillar was still considered undamaged and can be used for further mechanical tests. From the material index map: green = tetragonal; yellow Figure 12 -Pillar P10 pristine and compressed state. Scanning electron microscope images, and laue maps acquired using lauenn are used here to represent the martensitic transformation. Because the machine is displacement-controlled, a load drop is observed during the transformation. From the material index map: green = tetragonal; yellow Figure 13 -Pillar M2 pristine and compressed state. Scanning electron microscope images, and laue maps acquired using lauenn are used here to represent the martensitic transformation. Because this pillar was partially transformed in its pristine state, the stressstrain curve does not present sudden changes like other pillars. Rather, the transformation seems more moderate, translating in smaller load drops. From the material index map: green = tetragonal; yellow Figure 14 -Pillar C1 pristine and compressed state.
