<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this proposal was to measure the structural properties of solid H 2 in between 100 GPa and 200 GPa below 100K. Consequently, structural data on phase II , above 110 GPa and on phase III, above 150 GPa could be obtained.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The size of H2 crystals under pressure over 1 Megabar is very small (less than 10 µm), hence with a very small scattering power. Consequently, the prerequisite condition for the success of x-ray diffraction experiment is to be able to keep a single crystal of hydrogen up to above 150 GPa. If the crystal is too much broken, its X-ray scattering signal merges into the background. Also, all the parasitic diffraction, coming from the gasket or from the cryostat, has to be removed. If not, it can overwhelm the H 2 crystal signal. For that, the configuration of the beamline and of the diffraction setup (focus of the beam, cleaning up with pinholes, extra beamstops to remove parasitic diffraction from the windows of the cryostat, lead shield) has been optimized. Also, to safely reach pressures greater than 150 GPa, culets of less than 75 µm diameter have to be used.</p><p>To avoid the breakage of the crystal due to the decrease in thickness of the gasket, we had proposed to use diamond anvil with a pit . The H 2 crystals could then be confined in a spherical shell of helium pressure transmitting medium. Unfortunately, the making of a pit in the culet then favored the diffusion of helium in the anvil under pressure that breaks the diamond. All our attempts failed. Not using helium pressure transmitting medium, even with a ring of gold was not good enough to keep the diffraction from the H 2 broken single crystal out of the noise.</p><p>We summarize in the table below, the various attempts and the measurements achieved. Out of five samples, only one could be brought up to 160 GPa. This single crystal of H 2 was embedded in helium.The crystal was oriented with a c-axis almost parallel to the axis of the diamond. Consequently, within the x-ray aperture of the DAC only the 3 diffraction peaks, 100, 1-10, 010 were accessible. So, no information on the c-axis could obtained. The pressure was measured by the SrB 4 O 7 :Sm 2+ luminescence gauge.</p></div>

This measurement demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining diffraction data in phase III. It is seen that the discontinuity of d 100 at the II-III transition is small. At least an other orientation, which can give access to peaks along the c-axis is required to obtain the unit cell of phase III. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1 : Evolution of d 100 of solid H 2 at 40 K up to phase III.</figDesc></figure>
