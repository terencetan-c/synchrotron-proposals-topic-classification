<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>3D strain analysis across a shear band by tomographic reconstruction </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Despite the experimental difficulties posed by the nanoscale size of shear bands, a significant advance in understanding the mechanism of shear band formation in metallic glasses has been attained recently using a variety of techniques, including TEM, nanoindentation, XRD and magnetic measurements. In these techniques, shear bands are considered as linear defects propagating in a 2D sample and, therefore, it is implicit that the observed 2D properties are characteristic also of the missing direction. A typical example is XRD strain analysis, where the output is a strain averaged over the thickness of the specimen. Shear bands are, however, planar defects and the strain may change across the thickness. Tomographic techniques using X-rays represent the ideal tool for extending the XRD investigations of shear bands in metallic glasses to the missing direction. X-ray absorption (or phase contrast) computed tomography (XCT or PCT) have been recently employed to analyze void and crack formation in metallic glasses. However, XCT or PCT are not able to detect shear bands yet because density variations and thickness of a shear band are at the moment below the detection limit. Therefore, in our experiment we turned to X-ray diffraction tomography (XRDCT). The 2D diffraction pattern from a metallic glass is in principle circular; however, a detectable elliptical distortion (especially visible in the position of the first sharp diffraction peak) is introduced when there is sufficient elastic strain in the specimen. Our recent 2D XRD experiments have shown that shear band formation generates a characteristic antisymmetric strain field in the adjacent material (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In our experiment, we utilized this distinctive strain profile to identify the shear band paths within a plastically-deformed metallic glass via XRDCT.</p><p>We designed the XRD setup to have the tomographic axis parallel to the shear band direction (red plane in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). This ensures that the strain component along the tomographic axis (zz) can be reconstructed meaningfully. 2D diffraction patterns ( = 0.20664 Å; beam size 1×1 m 2 ) were recorded every 1 m along a line perpendicular to the shear band direction while the specimen was rotating around the tomographic axis.</p><p>For each point on the line, starting from the rotation axis, 180 projections with angular step  = 2° were acquired to cover a 360 degree range. Long term positioning drifts were compensated by periodically repositioning the specimen using a signal from some sharp diffraction peaks due to crystalline surface impurities. The data were corrected for the geometrical effect of the sample shape by assuming a simple rectangular shape and computing an average sample to detector distance for each frame as a function of y position and angular step .</p><p>Because of the extremely large number of 2D images necessary for the reconstruction, data processing was carried out on-site during the experiment using python scripts. The 2D patterns were integrated in 5° azimuthal slices between 0 and 360° using the pyFAI program to give intensity distributions I(q) as a function of the scattering vector q for each combination of y,  and azimuthal angle . We focused the analysis on the first scattering maximum (q1) in reciprocal space to optimize the diffraction experiment and reduce systematic errors in the following tomographic strain reconstruction. The values of √𝑞 1 for each y,  and η were determined by fitting the integrated patterns using a pseudo-Voigt.</p><p>The square root scale gives a symmetric peak shape for this sample, which improves the fitting procedure. A Fourier series as a function η was then employed to fit the peak position q1 as:</p><p>√𝑞 1 (𝜂) = 𝑐 0 + (𝑐 1 sin 𝜂 + 𝑐 2 cos 𝜂) + (𝑐 3 sin 2𝜂 + 𝑐 4 cos 2𝜂) in order to distinguish the individual contributions to the elliptical distortion of 𝑞 1 (𝜂) due to beam center shift (sin 𝜂 terms) and strain (sin 2𝜂 terms). Outlier data with more than 5X median absolute deviations of observed from calculated were considered as corrupted by crystalline peaks and excluded from the reconstruction. The strain component along the tomographic axis (εzz) for each y position and sample rotation  were then obtained via:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑞 0 = (𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑐 0 )) 2 , 𝑞 𝑧 = (𝑐 0 -𝑐 4 ) 2 𝜀 𝑧𝑧 = (𝑞 0 -𝑞 𝑧 ) 𝑞 𝑧</formula><p>In our calculation, we assume the scattering angle to be small enough that the strain along the z direction is equivalent to the strain along the scattering vector. This assumption may introduce an error of about 5 % (= sin 𝜃) for contamination of εzz by the components away from the tomographic axis. The tomographic reconstruction was performed according to <ref type="bibr">Korsunsky et al. [Acta Mater. 59 (2011</ref><ref type="bibr">) 2501]</ref>. The shape of the specimen was first reconstructed from the fitted peak heights via filtered back projection. A threshold was applied to this image and, assuming uniform scattering density, a mask image was produced and back transformed to produce a sinogram (radon function) of the sample thickness (T). This method was used to reduce artifacts introduced by intensity fluctuations, or noisy data due to crystalline impurities. The strain sinogram was then generated multiplying the sinogram of measured peak shifts due to strain by the sample thickness. In the case of a strain component parallel to the z-axis (tomographic axis), the inversion of the strain sinogram (via iradon) approximately gives the image of the strain component along z, where the paths of two shear bands within the specimen are clearly observable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). This experiment demonstrates that the path of shear bands can be reconstructed via XRDCT using the strain fields generated by shear bands. Therefore, we consider this measurement to have been a large success and we have, to a great degree, accomplished our goals outlined in the proposal. No experimental difficulties were encountered and the scientific support from the local contact was simply outstanding.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Sergio Scudino*, IFW Dresden Helmholtzstrasse 20, 01069 Dresden, Germany Junhee Han*, IFW Dresden Helmholtzstrasse 20, 01069 Dresden, Germany</figDesc></figure>
