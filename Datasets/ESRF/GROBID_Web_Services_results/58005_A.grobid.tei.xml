<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Polymer-sulphur composites as cathodes in Li-S batteries</p><p>Experiment number: 28-01 1122 Beamline: BM28 Date of experiment: from: 29/1/2016 to: 2/2/2016 Date of report: Shifts:</p><p>Report: Conventional lithium-sulphur batteries consist of a lithium metal anode, a sulphur cathode, and an organic liquid electrolyte. As the battery is discharged the lithium metal is oxidized, generating electrons and lithium ions. Instead sulphur is reduced by accepting the lithium ions and electrons (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In the initial reduction step S 8 rings are opened, yielding high-order lithium polysulfides Li 2 Sx (6 &lt; x ≤ 8). However, as the discharge progress, low-order lithium polysulfides, Li 2 S x (2 &lt; x ≤ 6), are formed, where Li 2 S is the final product.</p><p>Despite much research Li-S batteries still suffer from poor life time and charge efficiency. One explanation to these shortcomings are the solubility of the high-order lithium polysulphides, Li 2 S x (6 &lt; x ≤ 8), in the liquid electrolytes used in the batteries. Dissolved in the electrolyte they can travel between the cathode and anode. As Li 2 S x (6 &lt; x ≤ 8) species are formed, they migrate to the anode, where they are reduced to Li 2 S x (2 &lt; x ≤ 6). In a similar fashion the low-order polysulphides instead travel back to the cathode, where they again form high-order polysulphides, as so on. This phenomenon is referred to as the "shuttle mechanism". One method attempting to control the shuttle mechanism is by using carbon-sulphur composite cathode materials. 1 Work at the University of Kent instead explores the route to use polymer-sulphur composite materials, where the polymer is a mixed electronic and ionic conducting material with the aim to reduce the dissolution mechanism and shuttle mechanism of the polysulphides. Our work includes coating sulphur nanomaterials with sulphur-based conducting polymers, including PEDOT and poly-thiophene (PTh). For comparison we also studied a nitrogen-base polymer, poly-aniline (PANI). We have found that the capacity of the batteries are decreasing in the order of PEDOT &gt; PTh &gt; PANI. In agreement with a similar study on long-term stability and capacity on polymer-sulphur composites. 2 Method Measurements were obtained by collecting XAFS spectrum from '2025' coin cells with 2mm hole. This hole was covered with 3.4µm mylar film and the cathode material was detected directly through this window. A 2mm hole was also drilled through aluminium current collector and faced to the top cap of the coin cell. The active cathode materials were spin-coated, covering the hole, on the aluminium current collector (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The coin cell holders was glued onto the sample holder used in the XAFS chamber and connected to a Maccor battery cycler. During the measurement the XAFS chamber was filled with helium air. The VORTEX detector was assembled and focused to the cathode through mylar window. A nickel grid was used for normalisation of collected data. Instead the KEYTEK detector was used for the standards and Li x FeSO 4 F compounds. All measurement was conducted in fluorescence mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>During this experiment, three different types of cathode were analysed during battery cycling. One cathode was composed of pure sulphur and carbon and assembled into a coin cell. This battery was used as a reference cell to confirm the set up of the in-situ XAFS measurement during battery cycling. In the other two batteries, PANI and PEDOT:PSS binders were added to the sulphur-carbon composition cathode. Spectra were obtained directly from the cathode material. Two different types of sulphur were observed in all of the pristine samples at 2473 eV and 2480 eV which contribute to sulphur from cathode composite and sulphate from the electrolyte. Sulphate in electrolyte was expected because LiTFSI salt was employed in electrolyte. In all of three batteries, formation of polysulphide was confirmed by growth of a third peak at 2471 eV during the discharge of the batteies. First discharge profile and XAFS of Li-S batteries with PANI and PEDOT:PSS binders are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Intensity of polysulphide peak was the highest at the end of the lower voltage plateau in both reference and PEDOT:PSS binder batteries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>) whereas the most intens peak was at the start of the lower voltage plateau in the PANI-binded battery (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>). Polysulphide peaks were then decreased after experiencing the highest intensity in all of the cells. In the reference and PANI-binded cell, polysulphide peaks were no longer detected at the end of discharge. This suggests either all of the polysulphide was reacted and reduced back to lithium sulphide or that the polysulphide formed at the cathode travelled to the Li anode side were it got trapped. However, in PEDOT:PSS-binder cell the polysulphide peak was still detected at the end of discharge. This suggests that polysulphide was dissolved in the electrolyte and became unreactive, which disabled the reduction of soluble polysulphide to insoluble lithium sulphide. Also Li x FeSO 4 F battery samples were analysed using the KEYTEK detector, allowing us to study both the Fe K-edge as well as the S K-edge. These measurements showed that the Fe valence state is oxidised from Fe 2+ , in the Li x FeSO 4 F, compound, to Fe 3+ , in Fe x SO 4 F, as Li-ions are extracted from the structure during battery charging (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). The novelty of this experiment was the observation of additional activity of the S Kedge (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>), implying that the 'extra' capacity of this cathode material is associated with the sulphategroup in the struture.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Ideal cycling performance of Li-S battery showing lithium sulphide products formed during discharge. 1</figDesc><graphic coords="2,126.00,524.20,177.76,124.51" type="bitmap" /></figure>
