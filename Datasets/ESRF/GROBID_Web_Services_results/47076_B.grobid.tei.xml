<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to obtain first structural information about the Fe environment for 3 catalysts, Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 /CeZrO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 /CeO 2 , during redox treatments by in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in transmission at the Fe K edge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problems encountered</head><p>The grain structure of the catalyst powder was such that the sample loaded into a capillary container was not homogeneous enough and gave rise to a distorted signal, due to vertical beam displacement during energy scanning. This was partly overcome by extra grinding of the material and switching to a pellet reactor cell. During the beam time, the monochromator ran into a time-out error a few times. Resetting of the mono inside the optics hutch was required, followed by recalibrating with an Fe foil.</p><p>Experiments performed On all samples, series of redox experiments were performed. During change of state experiments, 1 minute QEXAFS scans were taken, while in fixed state some 5 minute scans were recorded. Reduction implied mostly hydrogen TPR or isothermal reduction, while reoxidation was performed using both O 2 and CO 2 . Several iron oxides, FeO, Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 3 O 4 , as well as Fe foil were measured as reference oxidation states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The 3 catalysts Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 /CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 /CeZrO 2 were measured at room temperature in air to compare the Fe oxidation state and environment. From comparison of the normalised absorption (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> left), there are little differences between the 3 Fe signals, some of which may be due to lower signal quality. In k-space, the k-weighted EXAFS signals are compared with the ones of powder references Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>right).</head><p>Best correspondence exists with the signal of Fe 2 O 3 , indicating that the Fe is essentially in a 3+ state with ferric oxide structure. On all samples, series of reduction and oxidation treatments were performed, either isothermla or temperature programmed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the H 2 -TPR and subsequent CO 2 -TPO from room temperature to ~525Â°C over Fe 2 O 3 /CeO 2 . Reduction brings down the Fe oxidation state to close to 0, while CO 2 is able to restore an oxidised state. A comparison of several treatments on the catalyst Fe 2 O 3 /CeZrO 2 is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Switching of the Fe oxidation state between reduced and oxidised is obvious. At first sight, the Fe state in the catalyst changes between 3+ and 0. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact oxidation state, the influence of the matrix CeZrO 2 compared to CeO 2 and the possible influence of repeated redox cycles on the local environment of Fe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>First results have been obtained on 3 iron oxide catalysts with different hosts and their respective behaviour in redox experiments. A more detailed investigation will require careful preparation of homogeneous samples to improve data quality and avoiding vertical beam displacement, for which adjustment is underway. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : left : normalised absorption signal for the 3 catalysts, Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 /CeO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 /CeZrO 2 ; right: k-weighted EXAFS signal for the 3 catalysts and for powder references Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 .</figDesc></figure>
