Grenoble, France Prof. LANDER Gerard H.*, E.S.R.F. Grenoble, France Mr. CHIVALL James*, U.C.L., London, UK Dr. WARD Roger C. C., University of Oxford, Oxford, UK Dr. ZOCHOWSKI Stanley W., U.C.L., London, UK</p><p>The light actinides exhibit some of the most intriguing properties of all the elements. Bulk alphauranium is rare in being a single-element system exhibiting a charge-density wave (CDW) groundstate. The rearrangement of charge at low temperature is accompanied by a periodic lattice displacement, and observed by the appearance of satellite-peaks in the diffraction patterns obtained from neutron or X-ray scattering. The present experiment investigated the effect of thickness on the CDW observed in thin-films of alpha-uranium grown with the [110]-direction perpendicular to the substrate surface. The films were grown by magnetron sputtering in UHV at Oxford University, with a Nb buffer layer used to seed growth of alpha-uranium on the A-plane of sapphire substrates.</p><p>Treating the films as a two phase system, we suppose that the atomic displacements necessary for the formation of the CDW state are not possible in the pseudomorphic (ie highly strained) film portion. Therefore, by increasing the proportion of pseudomorphic material in each sample we aim to suppress the formation of the CDW We notice that rocking curves at the U(110) Bragg-reflection from films with thinner uranium layers show a smaller component of scattering from the relaxed portion of the film. Hence, thinner films are composed of a greater proportion of pseudomorphic phase.</p><p>The integrated intensities of the CDW satellites show a marked drop-off at low uranium thicknesses [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>]. Scans were made along the L-direction ([001]) which lies in the film plane. Shown are straight-line fits to the data, with the satellite intensities apparently tending to no intensity at ~30 Å of uranium. (These films had a Nb buffer-layer thickness of 350 Å.)</p><p>The intensities of these satellites relative to the closest charge-reflection is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. A large and unsystematic variation is seen between samples, which suggests that sample quality is an important factor. However, there is a significant decrease in the relative intensity at U thicknesses below 100 Å. Little dependence on uranium thickness is seen above ~300 Å.</p><p>For similar U thickness, films with a thinner buffer layer show greater pseudomorphic proportion.</p><p>Changing only the buffer layer thickness avoids other effects of changing uranium thickness. Little dependence of the relative integrated intensities of the CDW satellites on Nb buffer layer thickness is seen in 150 Å U films [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>], suggesting that the charge-density wave state exists in both pseudomorphic and relaxed regions of the films, in contrast to the above hypothesis.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The mean integrated intensity of the (2 + 2 + 1 + ) and (2 + 2 + 1 -) CDW satellites and the integrated intensity of the (221) Bragg reflection as functions of U thickness.
