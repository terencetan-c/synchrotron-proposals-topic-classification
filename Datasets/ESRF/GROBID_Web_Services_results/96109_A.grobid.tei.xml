<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Overall, our experiment was successful with enough beamtime on a performant and easily-tuned beamline that is well-equipped. Specifically for this experiment, we were able to simultaneously record the X-ray induced photo-emission of Cr doped β-Ga 2 O 3 samples with X-ray fluorescence spectra. X-ray induced photoluminescence was of sufficiently high intensity to record very good quality spectra with a state-of-the-art Hamamatsu C10027 photonic multichannel analyser (PMA) that was specifically lent to us by Hamamatsu for evaluation purposes. This experiment has revealed to us two completely unexpected results: -Firstly, there is no evolution under X-ray beam of neither xanes nor photoluminescence spectra. This indicates that the Cr oxidation state does not change with X-ray whereas it was observed by our group when Eu is used as a dopant inside GaN.</p><p>-Secondly, the xanes spectra between as-grown and proton-irradiated samples are identical (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) while the photoluminescence spectra obtained simultaneously during the xanes measurements are completely different (see figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This is especially true for the set of samples doped with Cr and co-doped with Mg and Si (sample A and B). The photoluminescence spectra of the co-doped sample with Mg is dominated by a red broad emission at around ~725 nm. This band is assigned to the intraionic emission of Cr 3+ in the octahedral Ga site, associated with transitions from the 2 E and 4 T 1 excited levels to the ground state 4 A 2. Regarding the sample co-doped with Si, the photoluminescence spectra is dominated by a strong blue emission at ~350 nm assigned to intrinsic β-Ga 2 O 3 self-trapped excitons and donor-acceptor pair transitions.</p><p>As a conclusion, although we observe a dramatic change in the photoluminescence of Cr when irradiating with protons (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), its oxidation state remains constant (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) and dominated by the charge state 3+. Therefore, the difference on optical properties of Cr depends mainly on the process of excitation and recombination and not on its oxidation state. Different models based on secondary dopant/contaminant whose oxidation state could change with proton irradiation, such as Fe or other defect complex involving intrinsic defects, have been suggested by other authors to explain the dependency of Cr emission with the Fermi level location in β-Ga 2 O 3 . Indeed, taking advantage of the remarkable easiness of tuning of the beamline to probe another energy edge, we could check this hypothesis about the potential role of Fe as a charge transfer channel. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>) shows a detailed study of xanes in the region of the Fe K-edge, for both samples A and B, both as grown and irradiated. The Fe xanes spectra are found to be similar, suggesting that the dominant charge state for both samples is 3+. This result clearly suggests that other defect complex than single Fe should be considered as a channel of energy or charge transfer to explain the distinct Cr optical properties observed in β-Ga 2 O 3 samples. Complementary investigations using particle inducing X-ray emission (PIXE), Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction are currently ongoing in our lab to quantify and qualify this secondary dopant that will be the object of either a dedicated proposal or a publication. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: comparison of the X-ray beam induced photoluminescence of the two sets of samples A and B, either as as-grown or proton-irradiated. As-grown samples display a single blue emission band at ~350 nm while proton irradiated display a single red emission around ~725 nm. No evolution was observed during the exposure to the X-ray beam.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: comparison of the xanes part of the two sets of samples A and B, either as as-grown or protonirradiated. a) region of Cr K-edge b) region of Fe K-edge.
