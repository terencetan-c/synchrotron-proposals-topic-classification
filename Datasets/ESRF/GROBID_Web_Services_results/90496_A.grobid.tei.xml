Report:</p><p>Controlling polymorphism of drugs is important for both fundamental science and pharmaceutical applications. High-pressure polymorphism is recognised as a necessary part of modern polymorph screening. Chlorpropamide (CPA) is widely used as a model system to study polymorphism in drugs. It has five conformational polymorphs at ambient conditions, as well as multiple variable-temperature and variable-pressure forms. To date, all documented CPA phases have been periodic. In our previous ESRF experiment (CH-4901) we discovered a unique behaviour of δ-CPA on hydrostatic compression: it forms an incommensurately modulated high-pressure phase, which then transforms on further compression into a periodic superstructure with one of the cell parameters tripled as compared with the original δ-CPA. Unfortunately, the I/σ(I) ratio and data completeness achieved at the BM1A was not sufficient to solve and refine the structures of the high-pressure phases. Therefore we initially applied for a beamtime at the undulator source ID15B. We were allocated the beamtime at ID27 instead. We were able to reproduce experimental results which were previously obtained at BM01A but unfortunately the data quality was still not high enough, to increase data quality and to solve the structure of modulated phases. One of the reasons can be using less efficient CCD detector at ID27 whereas HPC detector at BM01A appeared to provide comparable data quality even with less efficient source. The results obtained at ID27 and its comparison with results previously obtained at BM01A are valuable from methodical point of view and were reported at the series of international conferences:</p><p>1) Zakharov</p><p>B.A. Studying Crystals at High Pressures: Do We Know all the Factors Influencing Data Quality?
