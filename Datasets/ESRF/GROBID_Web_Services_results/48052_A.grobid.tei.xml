<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Hydrates are ice-like inclusion compounds where guest molecules are trapped in water cages. Despite their major importance in industries and fundamental research, the formation process of hydrates on molecular length scales is still not understood and currently in the focus of scientific discussion. In our recent experiment SI-2146, we studied the liquid-liquid interface between water and CO 2 . We found that the interface between the two liquids can be described as a simple rough interface. This holds also when cooling the system until the region of hydrate stability is reached. However, right before hydrate is formed at the interface in the measurement cell, a thin layer was observed. This layer cannot be interpreted as a thin hydrate layer, as it is stable over ~ 40 min without provoking macroscopic hydrate growth. We concluded that CO 2 molecules accumulate in a thin region right at the interface and suggest that hydrate formation is triggered by the appearance of this supersaturated layer. It was the first time that we could directly demonstrate a change in the interfacial structure of water-CO 2 systems in the context of hydrate formation <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In the experiment SI-2362, we investigated how the presence of methanol, a well-known hydrate inhibitor, changes the accumulation layer.</p><p>Experiments were performed at the liquid sample setup of the high energy beamline ID15A at a photon energy of 69.9 keV. A custom made stainless steel sample cell with 2 mm thick aluminum windows and an inner radius of 12 cm was used, the same as the one in experiment SI-2164. The sample environment was able to sustain pressures up to 50 bar. The temperature was controlled via a heating foil and a water cooling circuit and monitored by two Pt100 temperature sensors. A Teflon ring in the cell provided a well-controlled meniscus of the liquid phase. We placed ~ 45 ml of a water/methanol mixture into the sample cell. The cell was then closed and flushed with CO 2 . After sample alignment, a reference reflectivity curve was measured. At 11°C, the pressure was increased until the condensation pressure of CO 2 was reached and a liquid CO 2 phase condensed. The temperature was then decreased, and several reflectivity measurements were performed at each temperature step.</p><p>Using a damping table, we were able to obtain very smooth reflectivity curves and increased the quality of the curves considerably (see the Figure <ref type="figure">below</ref>). In conclusion, the addition of methanol to the water phase inhibited the formation of CO 2 hydrate at the liquidliquid water CO 2 interface. In that case, the reflectivity curves did not show any temperature dependence, and the curves are all exactly the same. This result confirms that an accumulation of CO 2 molecules, as we observed previously at the interface right before the formation of hydrate, does not occur when methanol as hydrate inhibitor is involved. A more detailed data analysis is currently going on.</p><p>[1] L. Boewer, J. Nase, M. Paulus, F. Lehmkühler, S. Tiemeyer, S. Holz, D. Pontoni, and M. Tolan.
