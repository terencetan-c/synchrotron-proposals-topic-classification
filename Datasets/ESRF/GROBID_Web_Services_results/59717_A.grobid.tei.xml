<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed a pump-probe X-ray solution scattering on photoreaction of chloro(terpyridine)platinum(II) (Pt(terp)Cl) complex at ID09B beamline. To investigate the nature of excited-state dimer of Pt(terp)Cl, the concentration of Pt complexes, the ionic strength, and also the pH of the solution were controlled. For each condition, X-ray scattering patterns were collected at time delays of -</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Initially, the sample was dissolved in water to a final concentration of 20 mM. For the concentration dependence experiment, the scattering patterns of 10 mM and 2.5 mM sample solutions were also collected. The difference scattering curves of [Pt(terp)Cl] from 100 ps to 1 µs showed clear oscillatory features with superb S/N ratio (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). Oscillatory features of difference scattering curves decay as a function of time and resembles 100 ps solvent heating signal at 1 µs. Also, ionic strength and pH dependence experiments were performed for 20 mM [Pt(terp)Cl] solution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In conclusion, we successfully collected time-resolved X-ray solution scattering data of [Pt(terp)Cl] at several time delays and found out difference X-ray scattering patterns are highly dependent on the concentration of Pt complexes, ionic strength, and also the pH of the solution. Now we are analyzing the structure and reaction dynamics of platinum complex.  <ref type="bibr">; 100, 178, 317, and 564 ps; 1, 1.78, 3.17, 5.64, 10, 17.8, 31.7, 100, and 316</ref>   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>For the ionic strength and pH dependence experiment, 20 Mm NaCl and 100 mM NaOH were added to 20 mM [Pt(terp)Cl] solution respectively.
