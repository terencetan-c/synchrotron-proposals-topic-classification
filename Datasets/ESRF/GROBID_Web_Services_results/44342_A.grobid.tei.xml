<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the experiment and scientific background</head><p>DNase from shrimp has a very high specific activity, estimated to be 30 times higher than bovine DNase I, which is widely used in modern biotechnology. In addition, shrimp DNase is heat labile, and it has a particularly strong preference for the hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Shrimp DNase can therefore be used to specifically degrade dsDNA, leaving single stranded DNA (ssDNA) essentially intact. The higher catalytic efficiency, together with the reduced thermal stability, has made the enzyme an important component in kits used in molecular biology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The shrimp DNase consists of about 400 amino acids where the C-terminal part of the sequence resembles other endonucleases with a NUC domain. Nucleases with NUC domains are active towards both DNA (dsDNA and ssDNA) and RNA. The closest structural homologue is of a nuclease from an Anabaena Sp., but the sequence identity is only 29% over 130 aligned residues. The N-terminal part of the shrimp DNase sequence also shows low sequence similarity (20% over 140 aligned residues) to the structure of human dead-box Rna-helicase.</p><p>Because of the low sequence similarity to other proteins, the structure of shrimp Dnase have to be solved by experimental phasing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Crystals of DNnase had been soaked in solutions containing various heavy atoms. Data were eventually collected on two crystals soaked in bromine, one crystal soaked in zink and one crystal soaked in iridium. The presence of the heavy atoms were confirmed by energy scans.</p><p>The Zn and the two Br derivatives diffracted to about 2.7 -3.0 Å while the Ir derivative diffracted to 1.86 Å. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2 1 2 1 2 with cell parameters of about 176 x 47 x 50 Å 3 . The lengths of the b-and c-axes varied slightly between the derivatives. R sym for the Zn and Br derivatives were in the order 8 -10%, for the Ir derivative it was 5%. The multiplicity of the anomalous signals for the Br and Zn derivatives were in the order of 4 -8, but no significant anomalous signal was observed for the Ir derivative. The position of the Zn and Br atoms could be located, but further model building has not been possible yet. Attempts to perform phase extension using the high resolution Ir data has been tried but without success.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other (valid for all experiments; MX1060, MX1063 and MX1065)</head><p>Essentially all of the allocated beamtime was spent analysing proteins in the beamtime applications. Only very little time was spent testing other proteins for diffraction. These were crystals of a uracil-dnaglycosylase (UDG) complex, two different kinases and two metallo-β-lactamases (the latter was relevant for experiments MX1061 and MX1062). The UDG crystal diffracted to about 1.7Å, but peaks were split giving poor statistics and the structure could not be solved. One of the kinases was p38 from a new species (Atlantic salmon). The crystal diffracted to 2.7 Å, belonged to space group P2 1 with cell parameters of 67.78 x 100.93 x 67.89 Å 3 , b=98.15, and R sym was 5.4%. The structure has been solved, and further analysis of the structure is in progress.. The other kinase was a complex between PKA and two different inhibitors. Both crystals diffracted beyond 2 Å, and belonged to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with cell parameters of about 72 x 75 x 80 Å 3 . Rsym was about 7-8%. The structures have been solved and the inhibitors are identified. Further analysis is in progress. Two crystals of metallo-β-lactamases were tested for diffraction, and were found to diffract beyond 2Å. One crystal belonged to space group P43 and the other to P61. The structures have now been solved, and are currently being further refined and analysed.</p></div>		</body>
