<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The ability of the protein, Nitroreductase (NR), from E. coli, to reduce nitro groups to their corresponding hydroxalamines, makes it an ideal candidate for use as a pro-drug activator in gene therapy. A wide range of compounds, based on the pro-drug, CB1954, have been synthesized to date. However, these modifications have been largely ad hoc, and no clear structure-activity relationship has yet been postulated.</p><p>The solution of the structure of NR in our lab (J. Med. <ref type="bibr">Chem. 2000, 43, 3624-3631)</ref>, has provided us with the potential to address this problem.</p><p>As a first step to quantifying a structure-activity relationship, we collected several datasets at station ID14.4 on co-crystals of the enzyme with the pro-drugs CB1954, SN23862 and the irreversible inhibitor, dicoumarol (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a-c</ref>). These structures, all three of which diffracted to 2Ã… resolution, now in the final stages of refinement, have yielded valuable insight into the structure-activity relationship of these compounds.</p><p>Further structural studies are necessary to determine binding modes, with absolute certainty. The effect on side-chain position and composition, in particular, needs to be addressed. These studies will include cocrystallization with other drugs having varying side-chain composition. Effort is also ongoing to obtain suitable crystals of the reduced form of the enzyme. Due to the detrimental effect reduction seems to have on these crystals, a powerful X-ray source is required.</p></div>			</div>
