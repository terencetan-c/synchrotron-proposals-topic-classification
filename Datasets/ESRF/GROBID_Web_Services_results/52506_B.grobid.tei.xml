<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The preliminary data have been presented as oral contribution to the 5 th Natural Silicate Glasses Conference (satellite workshop of the Goldschmidt Conference 2013).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The paper has been submitted as Regular Article to American Mineralogist.</head><p>Silicate glasses of phonolitic compositions have been synthetised to infer the effect of the [Na/(Na+K)] ratio on the Fe structural role and, as final goal, on the physical properties. Fe can exist in silicate melts in a variety of oxidation states and coordination geometries (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Wilke et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Giuli et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">Giuli et al. , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">Giuli et al. , 2012;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Farges et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jackson et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rossano et al. 2008</ref>) and variations of the relative proportions of these species imply variations in &lt;Fe-O&gt; distances and bond strenghts, thus affecting glass/melt polymerisation, Fe molar volumes, melt density and viscosity (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Dingwell and Virgo 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dingwell 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liebske et al. 2003)</ref>. Alkali content is one of the main parameters that affect Fe oxidation state in silicate melts (see Duffy 1993; Moretti and Ottonello 2003 and references therein), but no measurements are available up to now to quantitatively assess to which extent alkalis can modify Fe structural role in glasses/melts.</p><p>In this study, by using Fe K-edge XAS spectra (both XANES and EXAFS), we determined the Fe structural role (oxidation state, coordination number, bond distances) of phonolitic glasses to infer the influence of Temperature (1250 and 1400°C), [Na/(Na+K)] ratio (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, respectively) and redox environment (fO2 from -0.68 to -11).</p><p>During this experiment we collected successfully XANES spectra for 40 different samples (synthetic glasses and Fe model compounds) with very good signal/noise ratio and EXAFS spectra for four samples (at least 3 spectra for each sample) at the Fe K-edge. Samples were prepered by smearing finely grounded powder on a Kapton tape and the spectra have been collected in fluorescence mode by using a high pure Ge-detector. To check the energy reproducibility, a Fe foil was positioned in the REFLEXAS chamber in order to collect simultaneously the fluorescence for the samples and the trasmission for the foil (internal calibration).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAIN RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS and IMPLICATIONS</head><p>Quenched silicate melts, with variable [Na/(Na+K)] contents, synthesized in a wide range of redox conditions, have been successfully analyzed at the Fe K-edge by XAS, in order to assess the [Na/(Na+K)] effect on iron speciation.</p><p>The XAS spectra of the samples synthesized in air and at 1400°C show that the Fe 3+ /(Fe 2+ +Fe 3+ ) ratio decreases by increasing the [Na/(Na+K)] ratio. This behaviour suggests that ferric iron is stabilised by cations with lower ionic potential and it prefers the tetrahedral coordination when sufficient alkalis are available for charge balance. The different [Na/(Na+K)] ratios strongly affect the Fe 3+ /(Fe 2+ +Fe 3+ ) ratio for any oxygen fugacity conditions, as observed from the linear relationship between log(fO 2 ) and log[Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ].</p><p>Extended X-ray Absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data of the two end-member synthesized in air indicate that Fe 3+ is in tetrahedral coordination with &lt;Fe-O&gt; = 1.88 ± 0.02 Å. This value is in agreement with previous studies on phonolitic and peralkaline rhyolitic glasses.</p><p>The experimental results show that at constant oxygen fugacity, the [Na/(Na+K)] ratio has a strong effect on the Fe 3+ /(Fe 2+ +Fe 3+ ) ratio and that the substitution of K for Na stabilizes a higher amount of ferric iron.</p><p>The data here acquired demonstrate that models (i.e. Optical basicity; <ref type="bibr">Duffy and Ingram 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ottonello et al. 2001)</ref> are not able to fully reproduce the magnitude of the variations of the Fe 3+ /(Fe 2+ +Fe 3+ ) ratio by changing relevant parameters, such as T and [Na/(Na+K)] ratio.</p></div>			</div>
