<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction -</head><p>In situ GISAXS and XRF measurements were performed at the DUBBLE BM26B beamline with the aim to investigate the thermal sintering of supported Pt nanoclusters. The nucleation and growth of the Pt nanoparticles by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) were previously studied at the same beamline <ref type="bibr">(26-02-672 Jan 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, 26-02-709 Feb 2015)</ref>. The first goal of the above-mentioned experiment <ref type="bibr">(26-02-726 Jun 2015)</ref> was to study the influence of different conditions on the nanoparticle coarsening, i.e. the substrate nature, initial nanoparticle size and density, and heat treatment atmosphere. Secondly, we evaluated the use of ALD-grown oxide overcoats to prevent nanoparticle sintering.</p><p>Experimental -In the beginning of the campaign, we encountered some problems with the monochromator cooling system and had a power outage in the experimental hutch. After solving these problems with the adequate help of the beamline staff, we performed 23 different experiments. These experiments consisted of the controlled heating of Pt nanoparticles supported on three different substrates (SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and MgO) under two different atmospheres (20% O 2 in He and 20% H 2 in He) and with three different starting nuclei densities (obtained by applying a different number of ALD deposition cycles). In addition, a set of supported Pt samples with different thicknesses of Al 2 O 3 overcoats was annealed to elucidate the optimal thickness for preventing particle migration and sintering. All samples were heated to 1000 o C using a fixed ramp of 1 o C/s until 400 o C, 5 o C/min until 800 o C and 10 o C/min until 1000 o C. In situ GISAXS and XRF measurements were continuously recorded during the anneals to monitor the evolution in particle density and dimensions (acquisition time 20 s). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the GISAXS patterns measured at 50, 550, 700, 850 and 1000 o C during the annealing of Pt nanoparticles grown by 50 ALD cycles on a SiO 2 substrate. The top row (a) shows the images obtained during annealing in O 2 atmosphere. The bottom row (c) was recorded during annealing in H 2 . Finally, the middle row (b) shows the effect of a 0.5nm Al 2 O 3 overcoat on the coarsening behavior of the Pt nanoparticles in O 2 . In all cases, there is hardly any change in particle morphology for annealing temperatures up to 550 o C. For higher temperatures, particle sintering can be observed in the GISAXS patterns as a shift of the scattering lobes towards smaller q y -values. This indicates a decrease in center-tocenter particle distance and an increase in lateral particle size. Moreover, the second order lobes along q z shift towards smaller q z values, meaning that also the particle height increases. Comparison of the top (a) and bottom (c) row shows that particle sintering starts at lower temperatures in O 2 than in H 2 . In an O 2 rich atmosphere, PtO x species are likely formed that can migrate over the surface and cause the larger Pt particles to grow at the cost of smaller particles. Because the particle sintering was more clear for annealing in O 2 , this atmosphere was further used to study the effect of substrate nature and initial particle size and density on the particle sintering. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (a)</ref> shows the average center-to-center distance between the Pt particles as a function of the annealing temperature. This value was estimated from the q y -position of the main scattering lobe as 2Ï€/q y,Lobe . Curves are displayed for Pt nanoparticles grown by 50 ALD cycles on different substrates (SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and MgO) with and without 0.5 nm Al 2 O 3 overcoat. Without overcoat, particle coarsening starts on all substrates in the temperature range 600-700 o C. 5 ALD cycles of Al 2 O 3 overcoating, corresponding to an expected layer thickness of only 0.5 nm, significantly delay the particle coarsening to a temperature range of 800-900 o C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results -Figure</head><p>For smaller Pt nanoparticles grown by 30 ALD cycles, 5 ALD cycles of Al 2 O 3 overcoating did not prevent particle sintering (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 b</ref>). Therefore, we systematically increased the number of Al 2 O 3 ALD cycles to determine the required overcoat thickness to "pin" the Pt nanoparticles and prevent migration and sintering. The effect of the overcoating was most clear for 20 and 30 Al 2 O 3 ALD cycles, i.e. for layer thicknesses of ca. 2 and 3 nm. Conclusions -The beamtime at BM26B allowed us to systematically investigate the thermal sintering of supported Pt nanoparticles with interesting applications in catalysis. Current preliminary analysis of the measurements proves that ALD is an adequate technique to produce and stabilize Pt nanoparticles onto different substrates. Further analysis is ongoing to determine the evolution in particle dimensions. Moreover, additional experiments are performed in our home lab to study the remaining accessibility of the overcoated Pt nanoparticles for reactants in catalytic processes. This work will be of high interest for applications of ALD-synthesized Pt nanocatalysts.</p><p>(a) (b) (c) (b) (a)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
