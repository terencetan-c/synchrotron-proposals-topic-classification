<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Antioxidative </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Background CeO 2 nanoparticles are at the moment actively investigated as promising agents in the therapy of different pathogenesis involving free radicals or oxidative stress, like Alzheimer and Parkinson. Although the antioxidant property of Ceria nanoparticles (CNP) has been largely demonstrated, the exact mechanism that makes CNP such a powerful tool is not completely elucidated yet. It is not clear, for example, which is the time evolution of the oxidative state of the CNP during the process of cell internalization; how it is influenced by the initial Ce(III)/Ce(IV) ratio; how the presence of a protein corona and surface functionalization can modify the response of CNP as free radical scavenger. In recent experiments carried out at the ESRF (exp. CH-4478 and CH-4716, paper submitted) we were able to demonstrate that CNPs, after internalization by human cells, show a significant degree of reduction, with the formation of Ce(III). However, the kinetics and mechanisms of the chemical reactions leading to this reduction are at the moment not clear at all. Aim of the present experiment was to shed some light on these aspects by carrying out XANES measurements on CNPs after internalization in human cells for different time intervals. In addition, we programmed to perform pulse-chase experiments as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental description</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample preparation</head><p>We used HeLa cultured cells incubated with CNP with a diameter of 5-10 nm. The small radius of these NPs gives a significant ratio of surface sites/bulk sites, allowing a reasonable contrast between (surface) Ce(III) and (bulk) Ce(IV). After 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120h of incubation with the CNPs, cells were recovered on filter paper and the Ce oxidation state of the internalized CNPs was analyzed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We encountered a lot of problems with the cryostat aligment. As a matter of fact, the first three day were spent in finding a correct configuration. As a consequence, just few samples could be measured by the end of the beamtime, and this resulted in the fact that we could not perform reasonable measurements on the samples programmed for the pulse-chase experiments. However, some preliminay results could be obtained on samples of CNPs internalised for long periods. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the Ce-L III XANES spectra of bulk CeO 2 , compared to those of CNPs internalised for 1, 3, 4 and 5 days. The corresponding derivatives are also shown for the sake of better comparison. It is quite apparent that, when the CNPs are internalised for 1 day, they retain a formal oxidation state of Ce(IV). Indeed, the edge energy position, as measured by the first maximum in the derivative spectrum, is identical to that of bulk CeO 2 .</p><p>For longer internalisation periods, the oxidation state of Ce changes. In particular, after 3 days a well defined shoulder appears on the rising edge at an energy corresponding to that of the maximum absorption for Ce(III), and the edge energy position shifts towards lower energies. For what concerns the samples after 4 and 5 days of internalisation, the amount of Ce(III) seems to further increase. Data treatment is still in progress for the quantification of the amount of Ce(III) that is present in all the samples.
