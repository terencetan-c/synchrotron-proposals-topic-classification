<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the current project is to advance our understanding of high-pressure (HP)-high-temperature (HT) interactions between rock-forming minerals of lower mantle (i.e. ferropericlase, (Mg,Fe)O (Fp) and bridgmanite, (Mg,Fe)SiO3 (Bgr)) and water by means of in situ synchrotron-based X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Synchrotron Mössbauer Source (SMS). This beamtime was a continuation of the proposal ES-1071. While previous experimental session aimed to study reactions taking place in the uppermost lower mantle, during this beamtime we aimed to investigate 1) possible reactions occurring in the lowermost lower mantle; 2) to compare HP-HT behaviour of Fp in dry and hydrous environment (in order to illuminate effects observed in ES-1071). Several diamond anvil cells have been prepared at the Bayerisches Geoinstut (BGI) and ESRF prior to the beamtime. A single crystal of ferropericlase and enstatite glass powder (as a precursor of bridgmanite) were loaded inside DACs. Water or Ne were loaded as a pressure-transmitting medium in order to simulate hydrous and dry lower mantle, respectively.</p><p>The strategy of the experiment was following: 1) XRD and SMS measurements of the compressed samples at ID15b and ID18 beamlines, respectively, prior to laser-heating (LH) sessions; 2) performance of LH at ID18 beamline and collection of SMS data on the heated spot; 3) XRD mapping of the heated area with collection of the powder and single crystal XRD at ID15b beamline; 4) depending on the samplepressure increase or DAC reload.</p><p>The results on Fp in the pressure range 30-110 GPa and temperature range 1400-2300 K are summarised in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. We have discovered that depending on the pressure and temperature conditions, Fp decomposes into a variety of structurally different oxides. While hydrous environment facilitates more rich mineralogical assembly, fewer iron oxides are formed as decomposition of Fp in dry environment. Interestingly, in hydrous environment, we have observed formation of a novel Fe3O5Hx hydroxide at the lowermost lower mantle conditions. This H-storage phase crystallized in orthorhombic symmetry, with unit cell parameters a = 7.8666(11), b = 2.5671(4), and c = 11.041( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) Å (at 105 GPa) and Pnma space group. Usage of multi-grain SCXRD allowed us to solve and refine its crystal structure that is given in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The crystal structure features channels running along the b axis. Bond valence analysis and DFT-calculation have supported presence of hydrogen within these channels. Upon decompression, Fe3O5Hx phase has been observed down to ~20 GPa. Another interesting observation is formation of (Fe, Mg)6.3O9 both in dry and hydrous environments. This phase features the channels as well (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) and it was long-debated whether disordered hydrogen or iron atoms are stored within these channels. Our observation of (Fe, Mg)6.3O9 being formed in Ne PTM, excludes possibility of H-storage in this phase.</p><p>Our results on decomposition of bridgmanite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 in water-rich environment at pressures 30-100 GPa and 1500-2500 K show formation of such decomposition products as stishovite, phase D and novel Fe3O5Hx hydroxide, depending on the HP-HT conditions.</p><p>The present project demonstrates that the chemical reactions taking place in the Earth's deeps are more complicated than previously thought. Mineralogy of the lower mantle and properties of the constituting rocks are strongly affected on the presence of water. The preparation of the manuscript with the detailed characterisation of the observed phases and geological implications is ongoing.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Pakhomova Anna*, ESRF 71 avenue des Martyrs CS 40220 FR -38043 GRENOBLE Cedex 9 Dubrovinsky Leonid, Universitaet Bayreuth Bayerisches Geoinstitut Universitaetsstrasse 30 DE -95440 Bayreuth Report:</figDesc></figure>
