The primary goal of the proposed experiment is to quantitatively investigate the sol-gel transition kinetics of sodium alginate caused by the diffusion to the interface of calcium chloride nanoparticles suspended in oil and surfactant by means of GI-XPCS.</p><p>The change in the interface dynamics was followed by monitoring the time evolution of the autocorrelation function: g 2 (q,t) ~ exp[-2(t/τ q ) γ ] of silanized SiO 2 nanoparticles (Ø ~ 100 nm) confined at the interface. The experiments were carried out in a sample chamber designed by O. Konovalov (ID 10) specially designed for experiments at the oil/water interface and setting the beam energy to 22 keV in order to overcome the strong radiation adsorption due to the presence of the oil. Systematically, we studied the influence of the polymer concentration on the reaction kinetics by testing sodium alginate 1 and 1.5 wt%. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows a typical q-space map of SiO 2 nanoparticles confined at the oil/water interface recorded for 1 wt% sodium alginate using a 2D detector (Maxipix). The intensity profile along q y is integrated between the two dotted black lines on the q-space map. To extract detailed dynamics information, the autocorrelation function of the intensity fluctuations in the scattered signal was applied to quantify the temporal evolution of the microscopic reorganization at nanometric length scale. The dynamics can be related to the intermediate scattering function through the Siegert relation: g 2 (q,t) = 1 + A(q)|f(q,t)| 2 which requires the system to be ergodic. This requirement can be extended to out-of-equilibrium systems such as gels, as long as area detectors are used. The obtained results for alginate 1 wt% are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The results of the exponential fits of the autocorrelation function show that the characteristic decay time "tau" increased of a factor 7 • 10 3 , when an early and late reaction stages are compared. These findings suggest that the dynamics of nanometric domains at the oil/water interface slows down as the sol-gel transition proceeds. Further experiment and data analysis are needed to shed light on the impact of polymer and cross-linker concentration on the reaction dynamics at the oil/water interface.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
