<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the present experiment we have measured the Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS) from an azobenzene polyacrylate, with and without UV photoperturbation, in its glassy phase, i.e. below Tg=20°C. The experiment was initially scheduled over the Easter period <ref type="bibr">(23-30 March 2005)</ref>, however the severe breakdown of the main storage ring interrupted the data acquisition just after beamline optimisation and sample alignment. The experiment was then successfully repeated on <ref type="bibr">April 20-26, 2005.</ref> In this non-standard experiment we needed to apply a strong UV photoperturbation to our sample. This imposed some constraints on the geometries: the sample was prepared as a parallelepiped with small thickness (size 20x4x0.2 mm 3 ) to achieve a reasonably uniform UV irradiation. Photoperturbation was applied by a high power 450 W Hg(Xe) lamp (Lot-Oriel #66142) filtered by a 320-380nm band-pass filter. We needed the new multilayer mirrors to focus the X-ray beam at the sample position with size 30x100 µm 2 (HxV). In doing so we were sure that the IXS signal was collected from the region of sample in which photoperturbation was uniformly applied. Sample temperature was routinely checked with and without UV radiation, in order to ensure that we were not observing obvious artifacts associated with temperature drifts. <ref type="bibr">Si(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">11)</ref> reflection was used to monochromatize the incoming beam with energy E=21.747 keV. Two different Q-sets were collected at each temperature spanning the range 2-15.5 nm -1 in 1.5nm -1 steps. Nominal Q-resolution was 0.45nm -1 on each detector. Resolution and background were measured on the same geometry of the experiment, with the sample kept at the base temperature of the CCR (T=15K). The resolution showed no appreciable difference from the standard resolution measured on a bulk PMMA sample.A typical spectrum measured at T=273K in dark at Q=5nm -1 is shown below, on the left. On the right we show the rough density of states g(ω) obtained from S(Q, ω) measured at T=273K in dark, after background correction and applying the appropriate detailed energy balance factor. By fitting the experimental S(Q,ω) with a sum of Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DHO) plus a flat background and a purely elastic term (elastic on the time scale determined by ID16 resolution) convoluted with the measured resolution, we could extract the sound velocity and we could measure the effects of photoperturabtion on the v-DOS. The sound velocity (2300m/s at T=100K, 2200 m/s at T=200 K, decreasing to 2100 m/s at T=273 K), as in general all the low-Q features, resulted independent from UV photoperturbation at both the measured temperatures (200K and 273K), as it is apparent from the following figures. This is in agreement with the localized nature of the azobenzene moiety photo-isomerization, which does not affect, in first approximation, the large scale features of the system.</p><p>On the contrary, and in agreement with our previous findings by Inelastic Neutron Scattering [L. <ref type="bibr">Cristofolini et al., Phys. Rev. E, 64 061803 (2001)</ref>] , we have found a clear influence of UV photoperturbation on the high Q features of S(Q,ω) in the region of the first maximum in the static structure factor S(Q), i.e. above 10-12 nm -1 which corresponds, in the direct space, to a typical intra-molecular distance for the two aromatic rings of the azobenzene moiety. In particular we have found a remarkable softening of the residual acoustic mode, and correspondingly and increase in the relative amplitude of the DHO signal with respect to the total scattering, which implies a photoinduced decrease of the system non-ergodicity, as shown in the 3.rd following figure. Our current findings seem to suggest that, at least in the low-T regime explored by the present experiment, azobenzene photoisomerization is a local process, which only induces changes in (S(Q,ω) located at large Q, however the effects of such localized process might extend to the macroscopic scale via a softening of a mode localized in Q-space at the first maximum in the static structure factor S(Q). This can be put in relation with the observed macroscopic decrease of polymer viscosity. Moreover, our data are fully consistent with our previous Inelastic Neutron Scattering data, in which we found a photoinduced decrease of g(ω) in the region of the BP, which could be interpreted in the framework of a general softening of vibrational modes in the high-Q region, in a similar way to what we have presently found by IXS in which we observe that intensity is subtracted from the 5 meV region in favour of the 3 meV region. The temperature dependence of the inelastic intensity seems not to follow the predictions of an harmonic oscillator. This points warrants further investigations, over a much more extended T range, which will the subject of a separate proposal. Full data analysis is in progress, also with a more detailed model including two modes: one pseudo longitudinal, propagating mode, plus a second non-propagating mode of transverse character. Given the relatively poor S/N ratio of our data this requires a global fit to the 10 different Q data-sets at the same time. A manuscript is in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>-dependent frequency of the DHO oscillation, together with a linear fit, from which the sound velocity is calculated.
