<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>isotope effect. Indeed, a similar magnitude of isotope effect was found also by neutron scattering experiments in an independent study by other groups, confirming our experiments and further enlightening the importance of local lattice fluctuations in the charge inhomogeneous state of the high T c superconductors.</p><p>During the assigned beamtime, we focussed on a systematic study of evolution of the isotope effect as function of doping in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 . We could measure temperature dependent high resolution Cu K-edge XANES spectra on four pairs of samples with O 16 and O 18 isotopes. These samples are with x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.15 (O 16 and O 18 samples making it 8 samples used for the study). The measurements were made at about 10 different temperatures in average within the temperature range of 15K to 300K. A 13 element fluorescence detector was used for the measurements. The emphasis was to obtain the experimental spectra with high signal to noise ratio and several scans were collected to limit the noise level to the order of 10 -4 in order to pin point small changes introduced by the isotope substitution in the system.</p><p>A part of the beamtime was used to study study doping dependence of the stripe formation temperature in the La 2-x Sr x Cu 1-y Zn y O 4 (x=0, 0.07, 0.115, 0.15, 0.2 and y=0, 0.01) using temperature dependent Cu K-edge XANES measurements. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows evolution of doping dependence of the stripe formation temperature in the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 system. In addition, we find that even a very small Zn substitution (~1%) has significant influence on the local lattice displacements. The results suggest that the local geometry around the Cu atom becomes rigid and the temperature dependent lattice anomaly (earlier identified due to formation of charge stripe ordering in the copper oxide superconductors) appears with smaller magnitude. The results on the doping dependent isotope effect and the effeft of Zn on the local lattice displacements are to be interpreted with respect to the inhomogeneous state of the high Tc superconductors, and the results are being communicated for the publication. During the allocated beamtime we could only make the measurements for the Cu K-edge XANES region with variable doping concentration on pairs of samples with different isotopes and pairs of Zn and non-Zn samples to investigate the charge inhomogeneous state versus local lattice diaplacements in the studied system. The temperature dependent Cu K-edge EXAFS is the object of future work and still to be performed to quantify the local displacements related with the effect of isotope substitution on the charge inhomogeneity and the superconductivity of the studied material.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
