<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal number 1177.</head><p>Assigned number of Shift: 2.</p><p>We came to the synchrotron with numerous untested crystals of two proteins involved in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>The first protein, ThiC, had given preliminary hits in our crystallization screens which could not be reproduced. We therefore tried to freeze the pseudo-crystals directly from the drops and brought these samples to the synchrotron. We hoped that we will observe diffraction spots giving us strong encouragement for the ThiC project. Unfortunately, these samples did not show any diffraction properties, possibly reflecting the very limited quality of these crystals or the numerous problems that can be encountered during stabilization and freezing procedures.</p><p>The second protein, Thi5, had been crystallized in numerous conditions giving small and beautiful bi-pyramidal shaped crystals. Attempts to grow larger crystal had been unsuccessful</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>at that time. As for the ThiC project, these crystals could not be tested at home. Nevertheless, due to their strong birefringence and reproducibility, we hoped that good diffraction should be observed. We had verified that these crystal were made of our protein and we had stabilized them using several different techniques (oil, high PEG, high Ethylene Glycol, high sugar, step-wise increment, etc). We brought along approximately 30 to 40 crystals. We spend most of the time (approximately 10-12 hours) working on these crystals. We could test every crystal that we carried along during the two allocated shifts. However, these crystals did not show the expected diffraction quality. Indeed, diffraction spots could be observed to about ~5-6 Å in very few cases. Indexing has been very difficult and numerous space groups can fit the measured spots. In addition, the calculated mosaicity was very large (more than 2-3 degrees) indicating serious problems of crystallogenesis. None of the different freezing conditions had any impact on the diffraction properties from these crystals indicating that the problem is certainly occurring during crystal growth. Since our last visit, we have tested multiple constructs of the Thi5 protein with the goal to induce another crystal form leading to different X-ray diffraction properties.</p><p>In conclusion, these two shifts have allowed us to reduce our effort in the reproduction of several crystallization conditions for the protein ThiC and showed that the crystal obtained with the Thi5 protein had to be significantly optimized in order to determine its threedimensional structure. We have continued our effort toward the structure determination of these proteins and have obtained new crystals for both projects.</p></div>		</body>
