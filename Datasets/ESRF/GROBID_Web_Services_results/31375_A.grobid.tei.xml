<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Charge Ordering in NaxCoO2 The beamtime was awarded for studying possible charge ordering in NaxCoO 2 . Although this ordering had been suggested to exist through theoretical studies, no experimental proof has been realised. High quality single crystals were obtained, and a thorough search through reciprocal space was conducted. Despite extensive searching for a number of days, at various temperatures, no sign of charge ordering was seen. The crystals are particularly difficult to grow, and although these were the best available, there quality limited the intensity of the main Bragg peaks, and as such will have reduced the intensity of any possible charge order signal.</p><p>As a backup; with the agreement of beamline staff, we decided to look at the highly doped bilayer manganite La 0.6 Sr 2.4 Mn 2 0 7 . This manganite had recently been grown for us, and is of particular interest, as it occurs in the phase diagram, where there has previously been measured a long range order hole. As such, any observation of long range order would be highly significant.</p><p>Upon cooling the crystal, superlattice reflections were observed at (0.175,0.175,10) and (0.35,0,35,0) corresponding to the positions expected for orbital and charge ordering. Polarisation analysis was conducted on both peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). This suggested that the signal charge ordering is dipole (spherically symmetric) in nature. By contrast, the orbital order peak exists in both polarisation channels, suggesting some anisotropy and a quadrupole nature.</p><p>In order to investigate the anisotropy of the orbital order reflection, we measured the azimuthal dependence of the reflection (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This was measured over 360º which was made possible by a complex re-configuration of the diffractometer. The azimuthal dependence can be compared to a simulated dependence for a bistripe and Wigner crystal. Although these simulations provide similar results, it is marginally closer to the bistripe model.</p><p>This experiment was highly successful and we are preparing the results for submission to Physical Review B.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experimental time was first schelduled for March 2005.
