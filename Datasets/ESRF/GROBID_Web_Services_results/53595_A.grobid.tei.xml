<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background and motivation</head><p>Solid oxide electrodes based on the perovskite La 1-x Sr x MnO 3 (LSM) are under investigation for application in electrochemical gas conversion, a novel technology for cleaning of diesel engine exhaust. During electrochemical gas purification NO x contaminants will be electrochemically reduced to N 2 and O 2-on the LSM electrode, when the electrode is electrically polarized. The Mn, and especially the ability of Mn to change oxidation states, has been suggested to be crucial for the electrochemical reduction of NO x . Despite of this, direct, in operando experimental investigations of the interplay between electrical polarization and the Mn oxidation state/electronic structure in LSM electrodes have until now been missing, despite of intensive theoretical work on the subject. During the experiments described herein the aim was to conduct an in operando study of how the application of electrical polarisation affects Mn oxidation state/electronic structure in LSM electrodes using a combination of XAS/XES experiments at ID26. The findings from these experiments may support the further development of electrodes for electrochemical gas purifications, and may furthermore be relevant to the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), community, which also applies LSM based perovskite electrodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental</head><p>The samples investigated were La 0.5 Sr 0.5 MnO 3±β (LSM50) model electrodes subjected to the in operando investigation, and powder reference samples of MnO(Mn 2+ ), Mn 2 O 3 (Mn 3+ ) and MnO 4 ( 4+ ) which were investigated ex situ. For the in operando investigation a costum-build testcell was used, in which the sample was heated by a small heat-stage and electrically polarized using a Gamry Ref600 potentiostat. During the in operando investigation the sample temperature was 500 °C and the cell was kept in stagnant air, while electrical polarisations in the range -850 mV to +800mV were applied on the electrodes, with the majority of the polarisations conducted in the cathodic regime from 0 mV (OCV) to -850 mV.</p><p>At OCV and with the various electrical polarisations on the cells the following techniques were applied: HERFD-XANES on the Mn K edge, non-resonant Kβ XES on the Mn Kβ main emission lines and RIXS on the Mn K-pre-edge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>HERFD-XANES: While positive (anodic) polarisation of the electrode did not affect the XANES, the application of a negative (cathodic) polarisation in the range -600 mV to -850 mVcaused a reversible shift in the Mn K edge towards lower energies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>   Non-resonant Kβ XES Non-resonant Kβ XES were recorded and IAD values calculated according to the procedure described by Vanko et al. 1 , the MnO spectrum was used as reference. A close to linear dependecy was observed between the oxidation states of the MnO x references and the IAD values (Figure 2).</p><p>From the IAD a decrease in average oxidation state for Mn in LSM electrodes from 3.4 to 3.2 was found when the cathodic polarisation was increased from 0 mV to -800 mV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>The combination of XAS and XES conducted in operando at ID26 has for the first time established extensive, exprimental evidence of reversible changes in the oxidation states/electronic structure around Mn in LSM electrodes upon electrical polarization, as predicted by theory. These findings allow for coupling changes in the electronic structure in an operating solid oxide electrocatalyst to the electrochemical performance of the electrodes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>a), due to a decrease in Mn oxidation state and the associated change in Mn-O bond distances.
