<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reports on experiments relating to long term projects</head><p>Proposers awarded beam time for a long term project are required to submit an interim report at the end of each year, irrespective of the number of shifts of beam time they have used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Published papers</head><p>All users must give proper credit to ESRF staff members and proper mention to ESRF facilities which were essential for the results described in any ensuing publication. Further, they are obliged to send to the Joint ESRF/ ILL library the complete reference and the abstract of all papers appearing in print, and resulting from the use of the ESRF.</p><p>Should you wish to make more general comments on the experiment, please note them on the User Evaluation Form, and send both the Report and the Evaluation Form to the User Office.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deadlines for submission of Experimental Reports</head><p>-1st March for experiments carried out up until June of the previous year; -1st September for experiments carried out up until January of the same year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructions for preparing your Report</head><p> fill in a separate form for each project or series of measurements.  type your report, in English.  include the reference number of the proposal to which the report refers.  make sure that the text, tables and figures fit into the space available.  if your work is published or is in press, you may prefer to paste in the abstract, and add full reference details. If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Nanometric Carbon film electron inelastic scatter using HAXPES </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The samples were prepared on silicon substrate. The carbon was sputtered using argon ions.</p><p>The current conditions during the sample production allowed the argon ion to be trapped inside the carbon layers. Our QA tests could not find out the trapped argon, since we used X-ray machine XPS. The spectrum below shows the argon peak (photo-electron emission) that indicate the high content of argon in the samples.</p><p>We conclude that it was impossible to obtain any meaningful results from the current samples. We plan to ask for a repeat experiment beamtime.</p></div>
