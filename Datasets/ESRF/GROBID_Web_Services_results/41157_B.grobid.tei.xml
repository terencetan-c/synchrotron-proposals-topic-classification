<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Indium and tin are scarce metals that have lately gained increasing relevance in the production of "high-tech" devices based on new materials (e.g., ITO, CIS, CIGS) and innovative technologies <ref type="bibr">(LCDs, OLEDS, etc)</ref>. While Sn has a dominant lithophile behaviour, occurring locally concentrated as an oxide (cassiterite, SnO 2 ), In is typically chalcophile and occurs mainly dispersed within polymetallic sulphides, seldom forming specific minerals. Accessory minerals from Neves-Corvo polymetallic sulphide ores (Iberian Pyrite Belt, IPB) are known to carry interesting bulk contents of both In and Sn <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. On the other hand, synthetic indium chalcogenides are recognized to enclose polycations [3], either dimmers [(In 2 ) 4+ in In 6 Se 7 ] or trimmers [(In 3 ) 5+ in In 4 Se 3 ]. Once the closest packing anionic array configured by sulphur anions in massive copper sulphides (not seldom carrying In) displays unfilled interstices, tetrahedral and octahedral, a tendency towards metal-metal interactions to form mixed-valent indium could be achieved by filling closely located interstitial sites <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>During a previous experiment <ref type="bibr">(EC-290, report dated July 23, 2008)</ref> polished surfaces which mineralogical constitution was studied under the optical microscope (reflected light) have disclosed difficulties in attaining the required vacuum level and in clearly identifying indium in the energy dispersive XRF spectrum due to the overlaping of In Lα and K Kα lines (from mounting resin). Nevertheless, challenging results were obtained for a few In L 3 -edge XANES spectra when irradiating a fragment of sulphide ore (bulk sample).</p><p>The aim of the present experiment was to perform a micro-mapping of In and Sn in selected fragments of polymetallic sulphide samples from IPB deposits, using scanning X-ray microscopy (SXM) and thereafter to investigate the electronic state of these elements using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the L 3 -edge. A significant improvement in SXM analysis was attained by fitting of the XRF spectrum with PYMCA; due to the low concentration of indium in the ore samples, spectra deconvolution (including escape peaks) was crucial, making possible to collect In and Sn XANES spectra at the same irradiated point. Once model compounds of indium had already been studied (thin films of indium-tin-oxide, indium metal and synthetics containing In + and In 3+ -namely, InF 3 in which XANES spectrum a "white line" was assigned), only a few additional spectra were collected for comparison, including In-metal for energy calibration.</p><p>Model phases for different electronic states and coordination environments of tin were irradiated: the metal (a ESRF standard foil of "white tin"), oxide minerals -cassiterite, SnO 2 (Sn 4+ in octahedral coordination) and romarchite, SnO (with a litharge-type crystal structure), sulphide minerals -herzenbergite, SnS (with distorted NaCl structure) and stannite, Cu 2 FeSnS 4 (a sphalerite-derivative), plus a commercial compound, SnCl 2 .2H 2 O.</p><p>In L 3 -edge was scanned from 3.71 to 3.80 keV in fluorescence yield (FY) mode and Sn L 3 -edge from 3.91 to 4.02 keV in the same mode. Fragments of a In-containing ore sample (LS5-180.6, pyrite-rich with ~90 ppm In according to Actlabs analysis) were irradiated at different points and various scans were performed per point. From a total of about 1230 registered scans (526 for In and 665 for Sn), 78 good XANES sum-spectra were obtained (30 and 42 respectively).</p><p>In two irradiated model mineral sulphides -bornite and chalcopyrite -silver was detected in the XRF spectra along with tin and Ag L 3 -edge XANES spectra (3.33 to 3.50 keV) were also collected.
