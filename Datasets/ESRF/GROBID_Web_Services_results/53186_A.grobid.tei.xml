<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Crystals measured at the ID23-1 beamline at the ESRF from june 27 th to june 28 th in the context of the MX-1556 project. Several crystals from different projects were checked at the ID23-1 beamline, for most of them it was the first time diffraction and it was uncertain whether they were crystals of protein or salt. Unfortunately all projects from the MX-1556 visit at the ESRF synchroton did not result in data good enough to prepare a publication.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>• Crystals of Nek9 kinase protein (Nek9). 13 crystals were checked and they were either salt or they did not display any diffraction.</p><p>• Crystals of LC8 in complex with the C-terminal domain of Nek9 kinase protein (Nek9-CC). 6 crystals were checked and they did not display any diffraction spot.</p><p>• Crystals of tri-domain procarboxypeptidase D (triCPD). 7 crystal were checked. 2 crystals diffracted beyond 3.5 Å resolution. We were able to collect a data set at a final resolution of 4.4 Å and the crystal displayed an hexagonal space group (sg 168 or P6) with unit cell values (207, 207, 81 Å). We were unable to solve the structure.</p><p>• Crystals of the Smc5-Nse2 complex. 10 crystals were checked. They were either salt or did not display any measurable diffraction.</p><p>• Crystals of Senp5-preSUMO2 complex. 5 crystals were checked. Only one crystal was suitable for data collection but diffracted at low resolution (5.3 Å). The crystal displayed a trigonal space group (sg 144) with unit cell values (132, 132, 97 Å). Unfortunately the collected data set was not good enough to solve the structure.</p><p>• Crystals of diSUMO2 linkage. 5 crystals were checked. All of them diffracted at high resolution (1.2 Å).</p><p>The crystal displayed a trigonal space group (H3) with unit cell values but after solving the structure by molecular replacement, it turn out to be only a SUMO alone.</p><p>• Crystals of OCT with norvaline. 7 crystals were checked of Ornithine Transcarbamylase in complex with a substrate norvaline. Only one crystal diffracted beyond 4 A resolution, P321 space group with a unit cell (180, 180, 116 Å), but the data set collected was not good.</p><p>• Crystals of the transthyretine domain of CPD (TTL). 2 crystals were checked. A very high resolution data set at 0.9 Å was collected. The crystal displayed a P21 space group with unit cell values (37, 47, 42 Å and 90, 90.17, 90 º) and the final statistics were excellent. The final structure was solved by molecular replacement. The structure has not been deposited yet.</p><p>Figure1 : Final cartoon representation of the dimer of the transthyretine domain of CPD at 0.9 Å resolution.</p></div>		</body>
