<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed preliminary (lab) experiments studying the structural stability of RuO 2 (110)/Ru(0001) under high positive potentials in the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . Additionally, we assessed the selectivity of RuO 2 (110)/Ru(0001) with respect to the Cl 2 evolution reaction (CER) in aqueous electrolyte by setting up an electrolysis of 5M NaCl solution in 0.01M HCl.</p></div>

H, lattice units At ID03, we tried to acquire reference data of RuO 2 (110)/Ru(0001) samples prepared in advance at JLU Giessen. We observed a strong overlap of the oxide signal with the cell background resulting in its complete disappearance since it was buried under the broad feature ranging at 0.7-0.9 H units (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Thus, we took the crystal out of the cell and measured it in dry (inert gas) conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 c</ref>). Even though the signal of the oxide could be measured in inert gas, its intensity was too low to be observed under electrolyte. The quality of the prepared RuO 2 (110) and the substrate Ru( <ref type="formula">0001</ref>) is thus very crucial for the electrochemical insitu experiments, making a fresh preparation of the oxide at ESRF necessary. Finally we succeeded to prepare a good RuO 2 (110)/Ru(0001) sample at beamline ID03Subsequently, we could record structural information in form of H, L, H+K scans and XRR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 a-d</ref>) in electrolyte. However, the electrochemical stability experiments were severely hampered by leakage of the cell resulting from the crystal shape and the way of mounting -we observed severe leakage especially visible in the cyclic voltammogram in form of reversible red-ox features of the Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ couple (from a contact clamp) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5 e</ref>).</p><p>The current electrochemical cell at ID03 allows mounting of single crystals of all shapes, however, to be sure to have a leak-free setup, the use of hat-shaped crystals turned out to be crucial.</p><p>Since no hat-shaped Ru(0001) was available during beam time MA-2635, we would need to re-measure the stability experiments in a (shorter) follow-up beamtime. In conclusion, we could perform preliminary experiments. However, we were facing technical problems (which can easily be overcome in a next beamtime) so that we were not able to finish our original experiment. The preparation, X-ray structural analysis under electrochemical conditions as well as the mass-spectrometric product analysis have been set up and shown to work properly and reliably.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
