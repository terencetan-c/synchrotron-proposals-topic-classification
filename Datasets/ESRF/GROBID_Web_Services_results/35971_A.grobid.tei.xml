<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The nature of ferromagnetic ordering of magnetic ions in epitaxial GaFeN and GeMn layers is not clear up to now. Unlike (Ga,Mn)As systems, for instance, where the ferromagnetic phase is observed only in heavily doped p-type layers, even undoped GaFeN layers exhibit ferromagnetic ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Therefore, in addition to the hole-mediated spin ordering like in GaMnAs, another nature of the ferromagnetism must be present in these materials as well. Two possible explanations of this phenomenon exist in the literature, namely the presence of coherent Mn-(or Fe-) rich inclusions or incoherent ferromagnetic precipitates of other crystallographic phases. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> the possibility was discussed to tune the size of coherent inclusions in (Ga,Fe)N systems by changing the charge state of the magnetic ions by an intentional co-doping with shallow acceptors (Mg) or donors (Si). The aim of this work was to study the structural parameters of inclusions in GaFeN and GeMn epitaxial layers by grazing-incidence diffraction and reciprocal space mapping. GaFeN layers have been grown by MOCVD method on sapphire substrates, the GeMn layers were prepared on Ge(001) substrates by MBE. For both sample types, a series of samples has been grown with various concentrations of magnetic ions and various growth parameters. X-ray diffuse scattering has been measured at a constant energy of 6.54 keV in grazing-incidence diffraction geometry (GID), in which the incidence angle α i was kept constant. The diffracted intensity was measured by a linear detector perpendicular to the sample surface. Therefore, the detector signal represents the dependence of the scattered intensity on the exit angle α f . We found that the GaFeN samples contained many structural defects (mainly threading dislocations crossing the whole layer thickness and small-angle boundaries) giving rise to much stronger diffuse scattering than the Fe-rich inclusions themselves. Therefore, we focused our attention only to GeMn layers, where no structural defects (except for the inclusions) were present. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (upper row) shows the reciprocal space maps of three GeMn samples measured in the GID 220 diffraction. In the maps the axes q r and q a are parallel and perpendicular to the 220 diffraction vector respectively, the (q r q a ) plane is parallel to the sample surface. The maps were measured with the incidence angle α i = 0.3 deg just below the critical angle of total external reflection. From the measured data, a threedimensional reciprocal-space distribution of the scattered intensity can be reconstructed; the maps shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. depict only the scattered intensity integrated over the exit angle α f . The samples #1, #2 and #3 differ in the nominal Mn content (3.4% in samples #1 and #3) and in the growth temperature (60°C for samples #1 and #3 and 120°C for sample #2). The central intensity maximum is the coherent crystal truncation rod of the substrate, for samples #1 and #2, the diffuse maximum is shifted radially towards the origin indication that the inclusion expands the surrounding lattice. A comparison of the measured and simulated intensity maps made it possible to estimate the inclusion radius to (1.2 ± 0.4) nm for samples #1 and #2, and (4.5 ± 0.2) nm for sample #3, as well as the mismatch between the inclusion lattice and the host lattice. For samples #1 and #2, we found the mismatch values (-3 ± 1)% and (-5 ± 1)%, respectively; the intensity map of sample #3 is almost symmetric, so that no deformation of the host lattice around the inclusions was detected.</p><p>From the measurements it follows that samples #1 and #2 contain coherent inclusions expanding the surrounding lattice. The inclusion size does not depend on the nominal Mn concentration in the layer; this concentration affects the mismatch, i.e., the enhancement of the concentration of the Mn atoms in the inclusion volumes. Sample #3 contains incoherent inclusions, containing the hexagonal Mn 5 Ge 3 phase, most likely. The small side maximum in the intensity map of this sample (Fig 1 ., upper row) corresponds to the diffraction maximum 300 of this hexagonal phase. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Azimuthal map of sample #3, the 300 maxima lie at q z ≈ 0.4 Å -1</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows a (ϕq z ) intensity map, where ϕ denotes the azimuthal position of the sample and q z is the vertical component of the scattering vector. The 300 diffraction maxima repeat with the periodicity of Δϕ = 30deg, which indicates that at least two different orientations of the hexagonal inclusion lattice exist in the layer. Further investigation of the inclusion will focus on the dependence of the local mismatch of the inclusion lattice on the local Mn concentration. A publication of the results is expected in few months.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
