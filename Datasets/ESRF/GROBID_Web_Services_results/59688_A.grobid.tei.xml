<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>As it is written in the proposal, we have perfomed a measurement to obtain energy dependence of specified diffraction on Co 2-x Fe 1+x Si samples. At last, we measured at three diffractions, namely 202, which is unsensitive to the order-disorder change (described in the proposal) and 111 and 002, which are sensitive. Procedure was following: after sample alligment we found and set the orientation matrices for the HKL mode on MgO substrate, which has well known parameters. Diffraction indices of the substrate and layer has a specific relation, because of their mutual orientation. Therefore we could find the required diffractions of the layer. Centers of the diffractions were aligned after that with several optimalisation angular scans. Therefore, the final result of our measurement is a set of integral intesities (obtained from measured L-scans) on required diffractions measured at different energies between 7 and 8 keV. Important task was to obtain good normalisation beacuse of the primary beam intensity. Because primary beam should be focused via two motors manualy within every change of energy, we have decided to fix the motors on specific values and measure intensity of the primary beam with respect to the energy. This measurement has been performed on the photo-diode, which has been put in front of the detector. In this way, intensity of the primary beam decayed quite fast within the require energy interval 7-8 keV, so the measurement on each sample include two calibration measurements of the primary beam intensity. Results of these normalisation measurements are in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Results of the integrated intensity energy dependence are in the Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Integrated intensities 𝐼 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 in Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, which include normalisation on the primary beam intensity, are computed in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐼 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 𝐼 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠 𝑖𝑛𝑡 � 𝐵 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏 𝑀𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏 � 𝑀𝑜𝑛 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠 𝐸</formula><p>Where 𝐼 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠 𝑖𝑛𝑡 is the integrated intensity obtained from the measured L-scan, 𝐵 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏 is the signal from the photo-diode measured in the calibration measurement -it corresponds to the monitor value 𝑀𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏 (at the same time within calibration). 𝑀𝑜𝑛 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠 is the mean value of monitor within the measurement of the L-scan and E is the energy, which is included here because of the linear energy dependence of the primary beam intensity on photo-diod singal.
