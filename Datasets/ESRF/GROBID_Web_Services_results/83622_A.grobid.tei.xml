<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment aimed at studying the mesomorphic behaviour of unsubstituted α-oligothiophenes (α-nT) taking advantage from the unique experimental set-up available at the beamline BM26B, allowing simultaneous SAXS-WAXS measurements at high temperature (exceeding 400 °C) under strong magnetic field. Most of the goals have been successfully achieved for α-sexithiophene (α-6T), while for longer compounds α-septithiophene (α-7T) and α-octothiophene (α-8T) we could not study the full nematic range because of the sample sublimation at high temperature.</p><p>Measurements on α-6T were performed, both heating and cooling, under an aligning magnetic field (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Obtaining these results over the full nematic range as well as in the higher temperature isotropic phase required several attempts given the strong tendency to sublimation of the material.</p><p>The change of the wide-angle diffraction pattern from an isotropic ring to a pair of broad equatorial crescents observed at TNI = 346 °C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) indicates the transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase. Cooling down the sample, it exhibits the typical anisotropic X-ray diffraction pattern of rod-like nematics, with a pair of small-angle peaks along the meridional direction (due to short-range positional order in the longitudianla direction) and a pair of diffuse equatorial crescents in the wide-angle region along the equatorial direction (caused by short-range positional order in the transverse direction). A peculair feature already observed in other all aromatic compounds is the presence of additional wide-angle reflections in the meridional direction, reflecting the intramolecular repetition of the thiophene rings. Further cooling from the nematic phase at T &lt; 308 °C resulted in the sample crystallization, with no evidence of underlying smectic phases. The experimental assesment of the α-6T phase diagram, at present only known from very few old and unconclusive reports, is a first important result of the experiment. An interesting result is the lack of smectic phases below the nematic phase, as this is in sharp contrast with predicitons of recently published molecular dynamics simulations. It would be interesting to confirm these results by performing supplementary measurements under different experimental conditions (e.g., by paying attention to the thermal history of the sample or by varying parameters such as the cooling/heating rate and the magnetic field).</p><p>Longer compounds α-7T and α-8T proved even more difficult to study, as their nematic temperature range extended at higher temperatures. In particular, measurements on these compounds could be performed only on heating (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</p><p>Increasing the temperature from the crystal phase, both samples exhibited a nematic phase with diffraction patterns similar to those observed for α-6T and no evidence of any smectic phase. In these cases we were not able to reach the isotropic phase (and hence to perform measurements on cooling), because of material sublimation. We expect that a different preparation of the samples, a more accurate sealing of the capillaries, and some modification of the sample holder (specifically developed by the beamline staff) could alleviate the problem, allowing a more accurate study of the phase diagram of these longer compounds. At present, a more detailed analysis of α-6T diffraction patterns is ongoing, aiming at obtaining quantitative information on both the long-range orientational and the short-range positional order. We plan to extend this analysis to longer (α-7T and α-8T) and shorter compounds (α-5T) in future experiments.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. F.
