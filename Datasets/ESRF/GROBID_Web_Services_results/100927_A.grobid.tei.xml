The goal of the experiment at the BM20 (ROBL) Beamline at ESRF was to characterize the speciation and mineral host phases of U in aquifer sediments of the U-contaminated area by U L3-edge XANES analysis for explaining the geochemistry of U mobilization and transport in the aquifer. As detailed in the experiment proposal, a borehole was drilled to a depth of ~40 m at a highly U-contaminated village to determine the shallow aquifer-aquitard framework of the area and collect sediment for geochemical analysis in every 1.5 m interval in general and more frequently whenever a change in the lithology was observed. Sixteen sediment samples from different lithologic units were selected for U speciation study at the BM20 beamline at ESRF. Experiment at the beamline: All samples were scanned to collect U L3-edge XANES data. However, due to the low U concentration (≤ 6.4 mg/kg), the U fluorescence signal in thirteen samples was insignificant; therefore, XANES data could not be collected for these samples. Only in three samples we could see the U L3-edge, and these samples were analyzed over 8 shifts to collect 37 to 47 spectra for each sample to improve the signal-tonoise ratio. Although it was not proposed in the experiment proposal, to utilize the remaining beamtime (7 shifts), we attempted to characterize the speciation and mineral host phases of arsenic (As) in aquifer sediments of West Bengal, India, an area known for the largest mass poisoning in human history due to the drinking of Ascontaminated groundwater. With the remaining beamtime, we could collect As K-edge XANES data for fourteen samples and references. The analyzed references represent sorbed arsenate and arsenite to different mineral phases, which are likely to be present in the aquifer sediments of the study area. Data processing and results obtained so far: The energy calibrated, merged, and normalized U L3-edge XANES spectra of three samples are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Despite merging a large number of spectra for individual samples, the merged sample spectra are still noisy. The overall inspection of the sample spectra suggests that U is present in multiple oxidation states (+IV and +VI) in the aquifer sediments of the investigated area. We are currently trying to estimate the distribution of U in different oxidation states by linear combination fitting (LCF) of the sample spectra. However, this estimation is likely to have high uncertainty due to the poor quality of the sample spectra. Normalized µ(E) 17150 17160 17170 17180 17190 17200 17210 Energy (eV)</p><p>The energy calibrated, merged, and normalized As K-edge XANES spectra of samples are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>. Spectra are dominated by a large peak at the energy position of arsenate (~11872.5 eV) and a weak shoulder at the energy position of arsenite (~11869 eV), suggesting that As is present in these samples as the mixture of arsenate and arsenite. The principal component analysis (PCA) of the sample spectra revealed that two components are required to explain the spectral variability in the analyzed samples; two components cumulatively account for 99.2% of the variability. The target transform (TT) analysis with these two components provided an excellent SPOIL value (≤1.5) for all analyzed references. A close inspection of the reference spectra revealed that differences in the XANES spectra of sorbed arsenite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) and arsenate to different mineral phases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) are often insignificant, at the most at the level of noise associated with the sample spectra. Therefore, it is concluded that with the obtained data for the sample, we can determine the speciation of As in the sediment as the sorbed arsenate and arsenite only; further specifying the mineral phase to which arsenate and arsenite are sorbed would be an overinterpretation of the data. For arsenate and arsenite, the lowest SPOIL and R values in the TT analysis were obtained for their sorption onto hematite. Therefore, the spectra of arsenate and arsenite sorbed onto hematite were selected for the LCF analysis of the sample spectra to determine the distribution of sorbed arsenate and arsenite in the analyzed samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>). Results suggest that, on average, 65% (±21%) and 31% (±19%) of As is present as sorbed arsenate and arsenite, respectively, in the aquifer sediment of the study area. Aquifer sediment color has a strong influence on the distribution of As species. Arsenic speciation is dominated by the sorbed arsenate in the brown color aquifer sediment, while the percentage of sorbed arsenite increases, sometimes even predominating the As speciation in the gray color sediment. These results support our earlier findings that redox condition is more reducing in the Holocene aquifers of gray color sand than in the Pleistocene brown color sand. The findings of this experiment will be combined with other sediment geochemistry and hydrogeochemical data to develop a watersediment interaction model for explaining the transport of As at the interface of Holocene and Pleistocene aquifers and, therefore, to assess the long-term sustainability of the Pleistocene aquifer for providing As-safe water. 11850 11860 11870 11880 11890 11900 11910 Normalized µ(E) Energy (eV) HNa 2 AsO 4 NaAsO 2 B1_135 ft B2_70 ft B2_116 ft B2_138 ft B3_115 ft B3_125 ft B3_140 ft B4_77 ft B4_128 ft B4_140 ft B5_75 ft B5_130 ft B5_150 ft B6_140 ft 11850 11860 11870 11880 11890 11900 11910 Normalized µ(E) Energy (eV) 11850 11860 11870 11880 11890 11900 11910 Normalized µ(E) Energy (eV) 11850 11860 11870 11880 11890 11900 11910 Normalized µ(E) Energy (eV) a b c d</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: Speciation of uranium in alluvium aquifer sediments of Punjab, India: implication for high uranium Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
