Experimental time was used to obtain a fuller picture of the chemistry of the Rh(CO) 2 unit on alumina. In experiment CH526, a 5 wt% sample prepared from [RhCl(CO) 2 ] 2 was heated under H 2 , and this was shown to attain a Rh-Rh coordination number of FD 12 by 120 o C. A similar temperature ramped experiment was performed using a 2 wt% sample, and this showed a lower coordination number (FD 10) at 140 o C, showing</figDesc></figure>

At room temperature the reaction is complete within 5 minutes, to form the bent nitrosyl species, [Rh(NO)Cl(O-) 2 ] identified in CH526. After exposure to CO for 45 minutes, the dicarbonyl appears to be substantially, but incompletely reformed. At 75 o C, this reverse reaction is essentially complete in 1 hour. Further treatment with NO again rapidly reforms the nitrosyl species. Analysis of the gas phase indicates that these are substantially substitution reactions, with little or no NO/CO disproportionation. In these combined EDE/mass spectrometry experiments the kinetics of CO displacement by NO can be derived by MS as the structure is monitored simultaneously by EDE. In principle intensity changes in the EXAFS data should also afford kinetic information. However, some overlaid intensity periodicity is apparent, and this makes such quantitative data difficult to obtain. At higher temperatures with rapid reactions, there is closer agreement between kinetics plots obtained by MS and EDE.</p><p>Thermolysis of the nitrosyl shows testimony to its higher stability than the dicarbonyl. It is stable up to 180 o C, with metal particle formation becoming evident above that temperature.</p><p>The rate of paticle growth with increasing temperature is also considerably reduced in the nitrosyl system, indicating that NO, or its chemisorption decomposition products, does retard particle growth. The pattern of particle growth also seems to differ form the two Rh(CO) 2 systems.</p><p>These experiments have shown that kinetic and structural information could be established simultanously for a clean reaction of a surface organometallic centre. Taken in conjunction with separate IR experiments, they have also begun to provide much more detailed information about the course of chemical reactions on the oxide surfaces.</p></div>			</div>
