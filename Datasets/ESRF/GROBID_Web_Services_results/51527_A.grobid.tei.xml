<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The first day has been dedicated to the decrease of the beam energy down to 20 keV, the alignment of the VorteX detector and the measurement of standard CaCl 2 aqueous solutions.</p><p>Second day: Dissolution of calcite in pure water at 310°C During this experiment, it appears that potassium K and sulfur S are present in the X-Ray fluorescence signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). After several tests to determine the origin of this unexpected pollution, it turns that the presence of these two elements comes from the cleaning procedure of the diamonds with sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4 and potassium nitrate KNO 3 at high temperature after the drilling process. Despite several rinsing of diamonds after the cleaning, a thin film or maybe some particles were stuck inside the perforated diamond. The presence of the K lines of K is particularly annoying due to the overlap of the Kβ line of K with the Kα line of Ca (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Despite this problem, the intensities of the K lines of Ca was high enough to be collected at 310°C up to 5 GPa allowing for the calculation of the concentration of Ca released in the fluid during the dissolution of calcite in pure water and subsequently the estimation of the solubility of calcite under these conditions. This clearly demonstrates the feasibility of the project conducted at ID27 to perform X-Ray fluorescence measurements of the amount of Ca at low energy.</p><p>Third day: Dissolution of calcite in pure water at 700°C During this experiment, the furnaces surrounding the diamonds were not able to maintain a constant high temperature value avoiding the solubility measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p> The origin of the presence of the K lines of K and S has been isolated and its source localized. This problem of contamination is already solved for future experiments by using nitric acid rather than KNO 3 in conjunction with sulfuric acid to clean the diamond anvils.</p><p> The ability of the furnace to maintain constant high temperature (&gt;600°C) has also been improved since by a using a new configuration of the furnaces inside the newly developed fluoX diamond anvil cell (test successfully performed in October 2013).</p><p>Finally, thanks to the exceptional potential of the high-pressure dedicated ID27 beamline to perform solubility measurements particularly difficult to achieve at low energy, solubility data have been obtained at 310°C up to 5GPa during the dissolution of calcite in pure water for the first time in a DAC. However, other isotherms at higher temperature (600-700°C) are particularly crucial to obtain new high-pressure thermodynamic properties of speciation and complexation from the solubility of calcite that will be implemented in the SUPCRT92 thermodynamic databases (<ref type="url" target="http://www.predcent.org/">http://www.predcent.org/</ref>), in collaboration with Pr. Sverjensky (John Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: X-ray fluorescence signal collected in the fluid during the dissolution of calcite in pure water at 310°C.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.95,247.90,453.75,261.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
