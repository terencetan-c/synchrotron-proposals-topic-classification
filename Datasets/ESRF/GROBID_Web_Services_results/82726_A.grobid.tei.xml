<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Full Field Diffraction Imaging on InGaN nano-LED devices of varying optoelectronic propreties  a) b) On Fig. 2 is shown one FFDXM image taken at the InGaN(103) Bragg reflection. The Bragg reflection is chosen to increase surface sensitivity (small incident angle 1.8°) and minimize projection issue (large exit angle 67.4°), we have also adjusted the energy (from 8 to 7.7 keV) a little bit to optimize the above condition. Figure 3:FFDXM imagse of the top right corner of zone 1 during a rocking curve. The 6 images are taken from theta angle =-0.3°, -0.2° -0.1°, 0, +0.1°, +0.2°, respectively relative to the Bragg angle. The log intensity is expressed in fake color scale.</p><p>On the gray scale image, the small and close nanopyramids can be clearly observed. However, not all the pyramids are visible. This is because some of the pyramids have different tilt angles and can only be observed on the shoulder of the rocking curve. On fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is shown some images taken from the rocking scan, of one patterned area inside zone 1 (the rest are now shown here for clarity). In fact, individual pyramids were observed as far away as +/-0.7° relative to the Bragg angle. Our analysis strategy is the follows, for each pyramid, the tilt angle is expressed in colors, as the hue(H) in the HSV geometry. The log of the intensity contributes to both the saturation(S) and the value(V) in the HSV. The noise is then removed by setting the value(V) of pixels with too low std. var. to 0. This allows us to produce some nice composite image (tilt map) of the nanopyramids as shown in   To summarize, we have successfully mapped out the different lattice tilt both among individual nanopyramids and among the differently (opening, pitch) patterned areas. FFDXM is very well adapted to our study thanks to its large FoV, nice resolution, easy and well established analysis routine. We managed to measure completely one sample in the 9 shifts that were given. While we lost some time trying to find the best measurement strategy (which energy, which optics, which reflection, what kind of scans, etc.), it is understandable considering that this is our first experiment and that we are among the first users for this new instrument. The best conditions to image this sample are now known and hopefully this can help us become more efficient in the future. We wish to express our gratitude to the beamline staff for their invaluable help throughout the beamtime.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>We used the new Full Field Diffraction X-ray Microscope on the ID01 beamline to study the different lattice strain/tilt both among individual nanopyramids and among the differently (opening, pitch) patterned areas. The experiment was a great success. We have now completed the quantification of the tilts, and show some of this results below (the analysis is still ongoing). The sample was mounted on an aluminium pin (fig 1a) (id:run466) and contains 16 patterened areas of different pitch and opening for the mask (fig1b). By recording images at the intersections of four zones, labelled 1-4 in the image on the right, we get information on four zones in one shot, fully exploiting the large field of view of the microscope. Some time was spent at the beginning of the beamtime to optimize the energy and Bragg reflection used for imaging. The best images could then be recorded while doing a rocking scan of the sample thus imaging different angles through the (103) reflection. f r o m h a nd w r i t t e n p a p e r : p l e : : t o b y + 1 , t o b z -1 ) t e r , mo v e i n l e nse s ( t y p i ng t o b y -1 , t o b z + 1 ) a nd t f i n 2D . 1 20 0 . 5) b e t t e r a l i g n ma nu a l l y ; e t y 22 ( no t v e r y p r e c i se v a l u e ) -22 20 1 v a l u e : 2D st r a i n ma p . c i t y ma p .
