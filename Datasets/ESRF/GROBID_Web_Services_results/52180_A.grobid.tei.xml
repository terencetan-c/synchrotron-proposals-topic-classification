<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our 4 shifts of beam time, we tested if the nanodiffraction scanning technique of the ID01 is applicable to organic semiconductor thin films. We fabricated thin pentacene films (C22H14). The material is deposited under ultra high vacuum conditions, forming crystalline thin films containing two distinguished polymorphs, namely the thin film phase with a z-spacing of 15,4Å and the bulk phase with a spacing of 14,4Å. Both phases show a distinct [00L] series of Bragg peaks. In order to minimize beam damage, we used a relatively high X-ray energy of 12,5keV at all times and a nominal beam size of 300 nm. The sample environment was streamed with nitrogen gas during the exposure to lower beam damage due to ozone.</p><p>We first scanned a structured patch made from pentacene on bare SiO2 in order to get a first impression of the overall resolution. The film thickness was 50nm. We identified the position of a structure resembling the letter "C", defined via photolithography, and then adjusted the incident beam angle to the (002) Bragg peak of the thin film phase of pentacene. We then scanned the whole letter (100µm x 100µm) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The pentacene covered areas with features of the order of 10µm gave a clear Bragg signal whereas the uncovered SiO2 surface gave no additional signal besides noise.</p><p>It is noticable that the resolution is better for the x-direction of the scan than for the y direction. We expected this, since a beam resolution of less than 300nm could only be achieved in one direction of a scan whereas the respective other direction suffered great losses in resolution due to a large footprint (&gt;1µm). For organic thin films, only the first few orders of a Bragg series give enough signal to perform the exeriments. To get a high resolution map in both directions one would thus have to scan the same region twice (turned by 90°). Next we intended to further test the spatial resolution for smaller features. Therefore, we scanned the region (80µm x 80µm) of a 50nm thick pentacene film twice. Once with the sample adjusted to the above mentioned Bragg conditions for the thin film phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and once to the bulk phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), respectively. The scans impressively indicate the spatial distribution of the two polymorphs within the film, as they clearly appear to have a complementary trend (cf. regions indicated by red outlines). The measurements also proves that we can resolve features on the sub-micron scale in one direction of the scan. Last, we tested the possiblity to investigate the crystal structure of burried organic materials. In the field of organic electronics it is often neccessary to deposit metal electrodes on top of organic thin films. These electrodes are often structured down to the scale of microns, thus making it difficult to further investigate the crystalline quiality of the films burried beneath using x-ray setups with large beam spots. Here, we scanned over a large distance (0,4mm) containing two stripes of gold with a width of 100µm each and a distance of 50µm. A 50nm thin pentacene film was deposited over the whole distance prior to the deposiotion of the electrodes. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the scan for two different incident angles. The red curve is the signal given by the scan adjusted at the (111) peak of gold. The two Au stripes are clearly visable. The signal stemming from the (002) thin film phase peak of pentacene is depicted by the blue curve. The dips in intensity underneath the gold electrodes can be explained entirely by the absorption of x-rays propagating through gold. Thus, we come to the conclusion that the crystallinity of our organic film is not affected by the deposition of top gold electrodes. More interestingly, the measurement implies, that in upcoming experiments we could investigate exclusively the active regions of electronic devices since the gap represents the channel region of a thin film transistor. In summary, we conclude that ID01 is very well suited for our samples and enables us to evaluate the structure of organic thin films on a submicron scale. This was not possible before; ID1 opens us the possibility to investigate the detailled structure of a variety of organic electronic devices; including burried structures, as in Au contacted regions, or multilayer devices suche as OLEDs and solar cells.We thank T. Schülli for making this experiments possible in spite of the short test beamtime scheduled.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 Scan over a structured letter "C" made of 50nm pentacene.
