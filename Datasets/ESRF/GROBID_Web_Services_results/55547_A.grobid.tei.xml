<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This study was aimed at characterizing the structure at a nanometric scale of a new class of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). These TPEs are synthesized via a new method, to know chain-shuttling polymerization process, that allows to get access to multiblock copolymers with tunable structure and consequently tunable properties. Besides, the goal of this study is to characterize the blocks structure and their potential self-organization as a function of the elaboration parameters, in order to determine to elaboration parametersstructure relationships of these materials. Particularly, the materials considered for this study are isoprene/styrene multiblock copolymers composed of hard blocks rich in Polystyrene and of soft blocks rich in Isoprene as schematized in figure 1 Samples synthesized under various conditions (meaning different catalysts ratios, monomers ratios, transfert agent concentrations…) have been analyzed by means of SAXS. The integrated intensity profiles have been calculated and the nanometer scale structure was deduced from modeling using the Irena macro as illustrated in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Integrated intensity profile of a TPE sample and modeling of the curve</head><p>The overall analyses indicate that the hard block has a disk-like shape and that they are embedded in the soft matrix, composed of the soft block. The relative concentration of the hard blocks as well as their characteristic lengths were determined. An example is depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> where it can be seen that the isoprene/styrene ratio in the synthesis solution strongly influences the concentration of hard blocks but not necessarily their mean diameter. Complementary AFM analyses were carried out on the samples analyzed by means of SAXS. An example is reported in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 4. AFM micrograph of a TPE sample (corresponding to sample from figure 2).</head><p>A good agreement was found between the results obtained from those two techniques. The establishment of the synthesis conditionsstructure relationships is still undergoing has no simple but rather complex relationships were found.</p><p>The second aim of the study was to characterize the strain-induced structural evolution of these materials upon strecthing. Besides TPEs know an increasing interest due to their shape memory behavior. More precisely, such materials are able to fully recover a previously applied deformation. Samples of interest were thus uniaxially drawn and the associated structural evolution was followed by means of WAXS during the tensile test as well as during the subsequent retraction/recovery step. An example of a typical behavior observed is depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. As can be seen both radially and (b) the azimuthally integrated intensities profiles are constant whatever the deformation, tending to show that surprisingly there are no significant structural changes during drawing. Particularly there are no signs of macromolecular orientation upon stretching although strain levels as high as 1000% can be achieved with these TPEs. This result, observed for all the studied samples remains unclear and unexplained, especially knowing that a complete retraction/recovery of the samples is observed when the sample is unloaded from the clamps of the tensile stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>These experiments have allowed to progress regarding the structural characterization of this new class of Thermoplastic elastomers consisting in multiblock copolymers. The currently undergoing complementary experiments, will allow to determine the synthesis conditions-structure relationships. Regarding the strain-induced structural evolution upon stretching, new and unsuspected results were obtained. An in depth analysis of the mechanical behavior of these materials, completed by mechanical behavior modeling, are currently under progress in order to explain the behavior observed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): G.
