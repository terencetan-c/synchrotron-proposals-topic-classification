<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment number: MX 1922</head><p>Beamline: The Eukaryotic Box C/D system that catalyse the methylation of 2'-OH groups in ribosomal RNAs was the system1 of the proposal. It is composed of proteins Snu13p, Nop1, Nop56 and Nop58 and snoRNAs for specificity. Only sub-complex of Box C/D snoRNA complex could be assembled. The complete complex assembly required proteins from the well studied archeal Box C/D snoRNA, resulting in a chimeric complex with only Snu13p and snoRNA from eukaryotic system. Of the several snoRNA probed by SAXS only few resulted in the assembly of the complex. These complexes were unstable and dissociated on substrate ribosomal RNA addition, moreover the oligomeric state of the complex was also found to be concentration dependent. This was apparent from the batch mode measurement of the complex which gave different Rg values as a function of protein complex concentration as shown in the figure below:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BM29</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Shown here is the scattering curves for the Apo complex of chimeric eukaryotic Box C/D snoRNA complex.</p><p>System 2 was composed Qin protein that contains 5 tudor domains and is involved in piRNA biogenesis.</p><p>Several constructs of Qin protein that contained tandem tudor domains were measured in batch, along with few measurement of single tudor domain of Qin. The SAXS measurement of the tanden tudor domains showed a strong concentration dependent inter-particle effect making the data analysis challenging. Only one of the constructs containing domain 3 and 4 showed slightly better results, shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> with a zero extrapolation curve. Still the concentration dependent inter-particle effect are obvious in the curves, which was evident as the change of Rg and I(0) with change in concentration. Despite this we were able to model the flexible linker between the tudor domain 3 and 4 using BUNCH. To overcome this problem few of the constructs were run on the gel filteration column to make use of in-line SAXS measurements. Unfortunately the presence of dirt and contaminants from either the capillary or the column resulted in aggregates and unstable baseline. The analysis of such data has not been straight forward.</p><p>One such run for tudor domain 4 of Qin is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and for tandem tudor domain 1 and 2 in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): 1) Neha Dhimole*: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER 2) Dr Teresa Carlomagno: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER 3) Andrea Graziadei*: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER 4) Simone Hoefler*: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER Report: Samples from the proposal number MX-1922 were measured on 23 rd-24 th of July 2017.
