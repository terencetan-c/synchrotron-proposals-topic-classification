<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proximity-induced ferromagnetism in SrIrO3(SIO)/LaCoO3(LCO) heterostructures (HSs) has been demonstrated to arise from interfacial charge transfer from Ir to Co, which we here investigated in more detail using Ir L-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at beam line ID12 on a selection of high quality SIO/LCO HSs. We specifically investigated the local electronic and magnetic structure of interfacial Ir ions, and in particular checked possible break-down of the pseudo-spin scenario. We could successfully use the allocated 18 shifts to carry out XAS and XMCD at the Ir L 2,3 edge of 7 different SIO/LCO, (SnLm)xN, and one SIO/LaFeO3(LFO), (SnFm)xN, HSs. Here, n and m indicate the number of monolayers of SIO and LCO or LFO, used for the HSs and xN the number of repetitions to end up in a total film thickness of about 15 -20 nm. Films were grown on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with surface area of 5 mm × 5 mm. All the measurements were carried out at T = 20 K in grazing beam incidence (15°) using the HU-38 undulator and a fluorescence detector. XMCD measurements were recorded for B = ± 6T applied in the film plane. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> we have shown the Ir L 2,3 XANES spectra for all the HSs. The Ir L 3 spectrum was obtained by averaging 20 -40 single scans, whereas for the L 2 edge spectrum 8 -12 scans were averaged. The spectra were normalized between zero before the absorption edge and one above the edge. The most striking characteristic</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>of the Ir L 2,3 XANES spectra is the sharp 'white-line' (WL) feature that corresponds to 2p → 5d electronic transitions. The Ir L 2 -edge is sensitive to transitions involving 5d 3/2 (i.e. J eff =3/2) holes, while the L 3 -edge is related to both 5d 5/2 (J eff =1/2 and the crystal field e g manifolds) and 5d 3/2 final states. Because the WL features are more pronounced at the L 3 edge than the L 2 edge, we can infer that these unoccupied 5d states are primarily 5d 5/2 rather than 5d 3/2 in nature, consistent with the almost completely filled J eff =3/2 bands. The L 2,3 spectra display a systematic shift of spectral weight to higher energy and an increase of WL-Peak area with decreasing SIO layer thickness or number of SIO/LCO interfaces per film. This indicates an increase of the t 2g -derived unoccupied density of states which is very likely related to an electron transfer from Ir 5d to Co 3d states at the interface. The charge transfer inherently results in a change of the chemical valence state of Ir. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> we have plotted the sum of the WL-peak area, + , versus the SIO layer thickness. The WL-peak area was extracted by careful subtraction of the background using an arctangent background function. The position of the step-function describing transitions into the continuum was defined by the following procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The maximum of the L 3 WL was assigned to zero energy and the L 2 edge spectrum was shifted in energy to have the first EXAFS oscillations perfectly overlapping for the two spectra. The step function was placed by visual comparison of the shifted spectra. A step function broadening of about 6 eV was used. Further, the WL integral at the L 2 edge was divided by 2.15 reflecting factors of (i) 2 from the occupation ratios of 2p 3/2 and 2p 1/2 core states and (ii) 0.15 from the fact that the sum rules are applied to the line intensities and not to the absorption cross sections. The right scale of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> indicates the corresponding chemical valence state of Ir when for the SIO single layer film (S20L0) an Ir 4+ state is assumed. In the extreme case, where the SIO layer thickness is only one ML (S1L1), a valence state of Ir 4.4+ is deduced indicating an electron transfer of nearly half an electron per ML. Changes of the chemical valence state are usually also manifested in an energy shift of the spectral weight of the XANES. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we have plotted the Ir L 3 WL-peak shift of the HSs (with respect to sample S20L0) versus the mean chemical valence state of Ir. The energy shift is nearly linear (~1.5 eV/electron) and about 2-3 times smaller compared to 3d transition metal oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The effect of spin orbit coupling (SOC) on the 5d states was quantified through the branching ratio (BR) of the WL integrals at the SO split absorption edges for the p → d transitions: BR = + . In Tab.1 we have listed the BR and the / ratio for the various HSs. The BR values are only slightly smaller compared to that of Sr2IrO4 (0.87) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, indicating nearly pure pseudospin J eff =1/2 state for all the HSs.  XMCD spectra were obtained as the difference of consecutive XAS spectra obtained with different photon helicities. The spectra were recorded in both field directions (± 6T) to exclude experimental artefacts. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> we have shown the L 3 and L 2 XMCD signal exemplarily for two SIO/LCO HSs in comparison to that of the SIO/LFO HSs. The L 3 XMCD is rather weak and even much smaller for the L 2 edge. Note, the L 2 /L 3 XMCD intensity ratio for Sr2IrO3 is only about 5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Generally, XMCD signal increases with decreasing SIO layer thickness and indicates alignment of the Ir magnetic moment parallel to the field direction, similar to the Co magnetic moment in LCO which has been analyzed in previous experiments. Hence, spin alignment in the SIO layer is parallel to that of the LCO layer documenting a FM coupling at the SIO/LCO interface. Interestingly, the Ir moment in the SIO/LFO HS (S4F4) is well comparable to that of the corresponding SIO/LCO HS (S4/L4) despite the much larger effective moment in LFO (≈ 4 B) compared to that of LCO (≈ 0.5B). The field dependence of the L 3 XMCD is shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> for sample (S1/L1). Within the experimental resolution, no clear indication of hysteretic behavior was observed. The normalized XMCD spectra were further analyzed using the magneto-optical sum rules given by the equations for the L 2 and L 3 absorption edges for the spin-and orbital momentum operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>: s z =n h /2· + )/( + ) and l z = 2n h /3· -2· )/( + ). The number of holes n h was deduced from the sum of the WL integral intensities + and the L 2 XMCD signal ( ) was negelgted. The effective spin, orbital-and total magnetic moments are calculated by: m l = -l z , m s = -2s z , and m t = m s +m l . As expected from the rather small L 3 XMCD signal, m s of the HSs is quite small. Interestingly, the orbital moment m l is even smaller despite the observed BR which indicates an SOC dominated ground state where m l is expected to be distinct larger compared to m s <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Possibly, this might be related to the difficulties in an accurate determination of the L 2 XMCD signal.</p><p>In summary, during the allocated beamtime we succesfully could adress to all the points raised in our proposal HC5007. A systematic change of the chemical valence state of Ir was observed with decreasing SIO layer thickness due to the interfacial charge transfer at the SIO/LCO interface. Despite the large degree of epitaxial strain within the HSs, the observed BR was found to be nearly the same in all HSs indicating a SO coupled pseudospin ground state of the Ir. The Ir magnetic moment was found to be rather small, m t ≈ 0.018 B, and parallel alligned with respect to the magnetic field demonstrating a FM coupling of the SIO and LCO layer at the interface. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 L 2 FIG. 1 .</head><label>321</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.
