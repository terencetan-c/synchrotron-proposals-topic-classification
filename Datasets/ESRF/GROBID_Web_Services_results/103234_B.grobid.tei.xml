<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>As mentionned in the proposal, the aim of this experiment was to understand the complex microstructure of NiCrBSi parts obtained by L-PBF. These alloys microstructures are known to be very complex with several low symmetry phases. Furthermore, the microstructure of NiCrBSi produced by L-PBF is not described yet in the literature. According to our investigations combining SEM-EDS and EBSD, the microstructure is considerably finer than in castings or hardfacing coating. Micrometric crystals are located at the periphery of melting pools, and within melt pools. Precipitates are so small that they are difficult to resolve. Global XRD analysis has been completed at ID22 providing global information concerning phase identification. However, in order to investigate which crystal are located in the core or the peripheral zone of the melt pool, local diffraction data are required. Therefore, we asked the ID11 team to perform XRD-CT. We studied one sample obtained by standard L-PBF parameters exhibiting microstructure gradient at melting pool boundaries (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 a</ref> and <ref type="figure">c</ref>) and one obtained with a highly preheated baseplate which does not exhibit microstructure gradient (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 b</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). XRD-CT was performed with a beam size of 150 nm and one slice every 10 µm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>According to our previous experiment at ID22, samples are composed of the Ni-rich matrix, CrB, Cr7C3, Ni3B, Ni31Si12 crystals. Further small Ni3Si precipitates are identified in the sample obtained with a highly preheated baseplate. The spatial distribution of Ni grains was reconstructed according to this phase identification. Small nickel grains are arranged at the periphery of the sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). However, peaks related to the other phases are superimposed making spatial repartition reconstruction challenging. Therefore, the spatial dispersion of phases other than nickel has not been plotted yet. We are still working on the spatial repartition reconstruction for the phases other than nickel but we cannot guarantee that it will be successful given the complexity of the diffraction pattern. Furthermore, complementary TEM-SAED analysis will be performed. Once spatial dispersion will be ploted, this work will be part of an article dealing with the microstructure of NiCrBSi obtained by L-PBF. Finally, these results will form part of my PhD thesis on the NiCrBSi alloy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 SEM-BSE micrographs of studied samples a) Standard preheating fabrication b) High temperature preheating fabrication. c) and d) higher magnification of resp. a) and b)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,146.45,36.85,308.08,231.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
