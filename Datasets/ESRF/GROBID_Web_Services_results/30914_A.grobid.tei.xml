<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Local contact(s): O. Mathon Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Christina Roth*, Nathalie Benker*, Marian Mazurek*, Lars Giebeler* Institute for Materials Science TU Darmstadt Petersenstr. 23 D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany In-situ X-ray absorption experiments in a working fuel cell under dynamic conditions Aim of the experiment:</p><p>Compared to pure platinum, Pt-Ru electrocatalysts show an improved CO tolerance in catalyzing the hydrogen oxidation reaction at the fuel cell anode in the presence of CO impurities. However, the mechanisms of the increased performance are not yet completely understood. The aim of the experiment is to follow changes in the catalyst structure and the adsorbate coverage in a real working fuel cell. The results obtained in these in-situ experiments will be used to develop more active, stable and less expensive catalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental set-up:</head><p>Three membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with different anode catalysts were prepared for the XAS measurements: a) with a carbon-supported Pt-Ru alloy catalyst, b) with a mixture of carbon-supported Pt and carbon-supported Ru, and c) with plain Pt supported on carbon for comparison. All MEAs were operated in different working conditions; with pure hydrogen, with a mixture of 150 ppm CO in hydrogen and with vaporized 1 M methanol solution as the anode feed. Spectra were recorded at different potentials at the Pt L 3and the Ru K-edge (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In each case, spectra were taken before operation at elevated temperatures but without gas feed, serving as reference spectra. Approximately 120 spectra were recorded during the beamtime, which are to be analyzed in detail over the next months. The optimum set-up for our experiments was found to be the commercial fuel cell hardware with a Kapton ™ foil beam window in fluorescence geometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>). This geometry is especially suited for measurements at the Ru edge at 22 keV yielding excellent spectra with good signal-to-noise ratio. New method for analysis: Only recently, a new difference file technique (∆µ XANES) has been developed by our partner Dave Ramaker at Washington university [2]. This novel method enables us to directly follow the adsorption and desorption of H, O(H), and CO adsorbates on the catalyst surface in a working fuel cell. It is even possible to distinguish between species adsorbed on Pt sites and those adsorbed on Pt with neighboring Ru atoms [3].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kapton window</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the steps applied sequentially in data processing; the edge step of all spectra is carefully calibrated and aligned, and a reference spectrum, where no adsorbate is present on the surface, subtracted from each spectrum obtained at different potentials (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). After subtraction a "signature" is obtained which is specific for the adsorbed species and the adsorption site on the surface (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conventional analysis</head><p>The EXAFS results before operation allow considerable insight into the Pt-Ru particle morphology; 1) the sum of the coordination numbers N Pt-Pt + N Pt-Ru resulting in around 9 indicates particle sizes of approximately 2.5 nm containing about 400 metal atoms, 2) a Pt-Ru/Pt-Pt coordination ratio of 1/8 or less is observed. The remaining large share of unalloyed Ru is believed to exist on the surface of the Pt particles as hydrous ruthenium oxide. Upon the first contact of the catalyst with the fuel, the O(H) (O or OH) coverage decreases dramatically from the as prepared "blank" catalyst (by a factor of 10 decreased white-line), along with a corresponding decrease in the Pt-O coordination number and rapid increase in the N Pt-Pt . The N Pt-Ru coordination ratio increases much slower with increasing current, indicating a much slower reduction of the Pt near Ru.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New ∆µ XANES technique</head><p>In methanol, both O(H) and CO signatures are separately visible with the ∆µ XANES technique (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, left).</p><p>When the signature intensities are plotted vs. current density (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, right), the data reveal a sharp drop in CO and an increase in OH coverage in the range 65-90 mA/cm 2 , i.e. the ignition region, and a pre-ignition region where OH/PtRu begins to form. These results are consistent with the well-known bi-functional mechanism often proposed in literature. Furthermore, an electronic effect is observed due to direct formation of OH on Pt-Ru shifted to more negative potentials by almost 0.1 V. Consequently, the new analysis method enables us to directly observe and verify the mechanisms proposed for a working fuel cell.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E(eV)</head><p>Background Removal Normalization Obstacles for measurements in methanol mode:</p><p>During recent measurements, problems occurred when measuring in fluorescence geometry using vaporized 1 M aqueous methanol solution as anode feed. These are presumably linked with the increased amount of liquid in the in-situ cell, both lowering the transmitted intensity and corrupting the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>Since these problems occur mainly during long-term operation at one potential (45 minutes are required in order to obtain a reasonable spectrum), we think measurements at beamline ID24 might prove helpful. At this energy-dispersive instrument it is possible to reduce the spectra acquisition time to less than 1 s. Moreover, time-dependent changes in catalyst structure and adsorbate coverage could be assessed more precisely.</p><p>However, the success of this approach is very much dependent on the data quality.</p><p>[1] C.
