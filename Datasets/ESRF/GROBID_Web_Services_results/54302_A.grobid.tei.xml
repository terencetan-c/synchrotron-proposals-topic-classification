<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of the proposed experiment was to directly probe the change in the electronic and local structure of the Co cations accompanying the formation of Co 3 O 4 from the Co II Co III PBA precursor during calcination by means of in situ Co K-edge site-selective X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Using the high-energy resolution spectrometer available on the FAME beamline, we planned to record the X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra for the two types of Co cations (Co 2+ and Co 3+ ) present in the PBA structure and hence understand the role of each cation on the calcination process. With such knowledge, the formation of the Co 3 O 4 oxide from the Co II Co III PBA precursor is expected to be completely understood, and hence the syntheses of confined mixed oxides better apprehended.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study</head><p>During this beamtime, we followed the in situ calcination of the Co II Co III PBA precursor into Co 3 O 4 oxide using site-selective XAS. The Kβ emission lines of Co 2+ and Co 3+ references were first measured, along with the Kβ spectrum of the Co II Co III PBA precursor; this initial step enabled to (i) calibrate the spectrometer for the HERFD-XAS measurements and (ii) estimate the relative proportions of each oxidation state (Co 2+ and Co 3+ ) in the Co II Co III PBA precursor. For each oxidation state, HERFD-XANES spectra were recorded at room-temperature and 5 temperatures up to 400°C, using the blowing heater from the Sample Environment Lab, which has been calibrated prior the calcination of the sample. The integration of the heater inside the spectrometer setup was realized with both the teams of the Sample Environment Lab and the FAME beamline (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Thanks to the high resolution of the spectrometer available on FAME, the Co 2+ and Co 3+ contributions could be well separated and the spectra for each oxidation state were nicely resolved. The normalized spectra obtained at room temperature are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, along with the spectrum recorded in the TFY mode. It is very clear from this figure that the TFY mode cannot discriminate the contributions from each site. The spectra of each oxidation state show very different spectral features, both in the edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and the preedge, as well as in the EXAFS part. The changes for each site during the in situ calcination process could be well followed till the complete oxidation of the precursor into the Co 3 O 4 oxide. The TFY-XANES spectra of the in situ calcinated oxide and the ex situ one are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The similarity between the two spectra clearly demonstrates that the in situ process was identical to those who happens during heating in the oven in the lab, and that the Co II Co III PBA precursor was entirely transformed into Co 3 O 4 oxide. The only difference lies in the apparent lower cristallinity of the in situ calcinated oxide, revealed by the smoother features. Tests have been performed on the Co II Co III PBA precursor confined in the mesoporous silica. Beam damages have been observed, and therefore this compound was not measured in situ.</p><p>The investigation of the use of PBA as precursor for oxide started with the Co II Co III PBA and the corresponding Co 3 O 4 oxide as it is the simplest case. Indeed no phase demixion can occur during this calcination process since only one transition metal is present. Therefore, as the next step of this study, we also measured during this beamtime the HERFD-XANES spectra at the Co K-edge of the Co III Fe II PBA precursor. The measurements were performed for the ex situ calcinated compound and during the in situ calcination using the heater; as for the Co II Co III PBA precursor, the spectra of the in situ and ex situ calcinated oxides are identical.</p><p>To conclude, we have succesfully followed by XAS the calcination of PBA leading to the formation of oxides. The stability of the FAME beamline and of the heating system from the Sample Environment Laboratory, associated with the high quality of the FAME spectrometer (using crystals from FAME and ID26), enabled to record very high quality data. Their interpretation, in particular from the EXAFS, will bring fundamental information on the formation of the Co 3 O 4 oxide from the CoCo PBA.  Justification and comments about the use of beam time : Three shifts were dedicated to the alignment of the beamline and of the 5 crystals of the spectrometer, the investigation of reference samples and the setup (including calibration) of the heating system. The 16 other shifts enabled to investige the samples for the different calcination temperatures. Since the CoCo PBA confined in mesoporous silica presented radiation damages, we choose to investigate only the bulk compound, for both the CoCo and CoFe PBAs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimental setup for in situ site-selective XAS</figDesc><graphic coords="1,69.36,644.48,252.96,139.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
