<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed the X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy experiment in cryogenic conditions in the He cryostat of BM23. Samples were prepared in our home laboratory: ~50 μl drops of solution were pipetted into the custom sample holder sealed with kapton tape and immediately frozen in LN2, then transferred to the ESRF in a LN2 deware. The first batch of samples was deposited in a holder made of a black plastic in a 3D printer: we realized that the black plastic breaks in LN2, so we had to trasfer the samples in peek sample holders. This will have to be kept in mind for future preparations. We measured silver K-edge absorption spectra by scanning the edge region between 25.30 keV and 26.49 keV (k = 16 Å -1 ) with the Si(311) monochromator, with constant steps in k in the exafs region. The continuous scanning mode was tested, but in this mode the glitches of the Si(311) monochromator could not be corrected through the normalization by the incoming current, in contrast with what was previously observed with the Si(111). Therefore, the scans were run in step-by-step mode.</p><p>The samples were two different preparations of Ag2S quantum dots (QD) synthesized using the same precursors but different thiolate capping agents: glutahtion (GSH) or D-Penicillamine (Pen). The reaction time during the synthesis was chosen in order to produce nanocystals of different sizes, ranging from 2 to 6 nm diameter,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>according to a TEM characterization. The size is proportional to the reaction time, which was 1h or 2h for GSH-Ag2S, and 30m or 1h30m for Pen-Ag2S. The four QD were measured as synthesized in water (samples labeled "wat"), after 24h in cell culture medium (labeled "med"), or after 24h in hepatic cells (labeled "cell"), in order to probe the stability of these engineered nanomaterials in biological media. As reference samples we used a previously characterized Ag(I)-GSH complex (5 mM) in solution, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and a bulk Ag2S powder diluted in BN and pressed in a pellet (5 mm diameter).</p><p>The concentration of the "wat" samples was in the range 1-4 mM (~100-400 ppm): the EXAFS spectra could be measured on all "wat" samples, but the least concentrated ones required a long integration time (up to 9 scans to be merged in the final spectrum). In some "med" and "cell" samples that were not concentrated enough to acquire the EXAFS spectra, only the XANES region was scanned up to 25.70 keV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The experimental spectra of the "wat" samples are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, together with the spectrum of the bulk form of Ag2S.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Experimental XANES (left) and EXAFS spectra in the reciprocal space (central panel) and in the real space (right) on Ag2S in the bulk (blue) and nanocrystal form. Ag2S nanocrystals were synthesized in water in the presence of glutathion for 1h (red) or 2h (green), or in the presence of D-Penicillamine for 30m (purple) or 1h30m (khaki yellow).</head><p>The EXAFS spectra of the QD, as extracted in the reciprocal space (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, central panel), show a quick damping of the oscillations, indicative of highly disordered systems. When the sample is concentrated enough, weak but significant oscillations are observable up to k = 14 Å -1 (e.g. Pen 1h30 sample, khaki curve. Concentration ~ 4 mM). All spectra could be fourier-transformed in the range [2.3 -11] Å -1 and compared (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, right) with the bulk. The spectra of the Ag2S QDs show two main peaks attributable to Ag-S and a Ag-Ag single scattering contributions, as in the bulk sample (blue curve). However, the second shell Ag-Ag contribution is much weaker in the QDs than in the bulk Ag2S sample. The EXAFS spectra were fitted ab initio in order to obtain the number of S and Ag neighbors for the Ag absorber. The data were fitted in the real space, in the [1 -3.2] Å range. A very simple fitting model based on two singlescattering paths accounts for the observed spectral features, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, where the best fitting curve and the relative single scattering Ag-S and Ag-Ag contributions are shown for the Pen-Ag2S "wat" 1h30 sample. The fit results indicate that, in all QD samples, the Ag absorber is surrounded by 2 S neighbours at ~ 2.48 Å, and by ~4 Ag atoms at 2.97 Å. The values obtained for the first S shell do not differ (within the error) from the ones relative to the bulk sample. The second shell, instead, differes dramatically in the number of neighbors (4 vs 8) and significantly in their distance from the absorber (0.1 Å shorter in QDs than in bulk Ag2S). Again, this suggests a strong disorder in the QDs, and a poor crystallinity in their Ag2S core.</p><p>Finally, we could compare the XAFS spectra of the four QDs formulations in water, after 24h in cell culture medium, and after 24h or 72h in hepatic cells. No difference is observed in the XANES spectra of the samples in the different conditions. When the EXAFS spectra could be acquired and extracted, small differences seem to arise in the first spectra after 72h in cells, indicating a possible small deformation of the average coordination sphere of silver (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Overall, our data reveal that the core of the QDs is essentially stable and no significant release of metal ions and recombination with biomolecules is observed, in contrast with our previous observations on InP-based QDs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> We are currently merging these results with the photophysical measurements performed at the SyMESS laboratory, in order to understand wether a correlation exists between the observed structural disorder and the photoluminescence (PL) of the QDs. We are improving the formulations with the aim to enhance the PL quantum yield, in particular of the D-penicillamine-coated QDs. The latter showed no cytotoxicity in the assays performed at the LCBM, and the XAFS results proved their structural stability in biological media.</p><p>This study contributed to identify promising engineered nanomaterials for biomedical applications. The experimental protocol, consisting in the selective interrogation of the core atoms of the QDs in different biological media to probe teir stability, should be applied to the new formulations with improved PL properties that we are currently synthesizing.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
