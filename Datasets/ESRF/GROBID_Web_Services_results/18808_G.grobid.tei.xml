<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: It was initially hoped to collect MAD data at the Nickel and bromine edges as the crystals require 10mM Nickel to grow and other crystals had been soaked in NaBr. However although the crystals diffracted to better than 2.5 Ã…, there was disorder and splitting which had not been clearly seen on the home source. Despite screening quite a few crystals none were suitable for MAD experiments. One crystal mounted late on was better than the others and a data set was collected. This has been processed and has an Rmerge of 8% between 7 and 2.2 A and reasonable completeness. Molecular replacement with a 50% homologous protein has given a good signal (corellation of 0.355 in Molrep next solution 0.227) and there is density for non-identical side chains truncated to Ala. Rfree is staying relatively high in refinement at present particularly for the low resolution data and poor spot shape is still a problem with this crystal, so another data set may be necessary to get good refinement. Crystallisation of complexes with binding partners is being pursued.</p></div>
