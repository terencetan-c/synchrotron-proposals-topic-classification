<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The local electronic and atomic structure of (111)-oriented, single crystalline mixed Ce 1-x Pr x O 2- (x= 0, 0.1 and 0.6) epitaxial thin films on silicon substrates have been investigated in view of engineering redox properties of complex oxide films. X-ray absorption near edge structure reveals that Pr shows only +3 valence and Ce shows only nominal +4 valence in mixed oxides. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies were performed at K edges of Ce and Pr using a specially designed monochromator system for high energy measurements. They demonstrate that the fluorite lattice of ceria (CeO 2 ) is almost not perturbed for x=0.1 sample, while higher Pr concentration (x=0.6) not only generates a higher disorder level (thus more disordered oxygen) but also causes a significant reduction of Ce-O interatomic distances. The valence states of the cations were also examined by techniques operating in highly reducing environments: scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy; in these reducing environments, evidence for the presence of Ce3+ was clearly found for the higher Pr concentration. Thus, the introduction of Pr3+ into CeO 2 strongly enhances the oxygen exchange properties of CeO 2 . This improved oxygen mobility properties of CeO 2 are attributed to the lattice disorder induced by Pr mixing in the CeO 2 fluorite lattice, as demonstrated by EXAFS measurements. Thus, a comprehensive picture of the modifications of the atomic and electronic structure of Ce 1-x Pr x O 2- epitaxial films and their relation is obtained.</p><p>These results have been published in <ref type="bibr">Niu et al., Jour. Appl. Phys. 116, 123515 (2014)</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Ce K-edge XAFS data. (a) back ground subtracted and (b) Fourier Transform and fits.
