<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In aqueous solution, synthesis with actinide elements at oxidation state +IV is always hampered by competition with hydrolysis. Clearly, the hydrolytic form of actinides and in particular actinide(IV) in medium acidic media is a key question in order to assess the reaction, incorporation or transportation mechanisms from the aqueous medium to the system of interest. A tremendous amount of data has been produced about the hydrolytic forms of actinides from strong acidic to natural water pH. It is far beyond the scope of this project to address all these forms. However we would like to report in this experiment on the behavior of neptunium(IV) in buffered HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid ) solutions. The scheme bellow shows the formula of HEPES. From literature data, it is believed that in water, the acidic proton is positioned either on the sulfonate group or on the amine function.</p><p>In this experiment, we have combined pHmetric measurements with in situ spectrophotometry and post mortem EXAFS studies to better understand the behavior of the neptunium(IV) aqueous ion in HEPES buffered acidic solution. This short delay between sample preparation and measurement could only be achieved by a very good coordination between the RCTs of CEA Marcoule and ESRF. Note that we have observed a slow oxidation of Np(IV) into Np(V) with time higher than 10 hours (and strongly depending on the pH of the solution).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the UV-PIR spectrophotometric spectra of the Np-HEPES solution at various pH. Two sets of absorption bands are characteristic of Np(IV) in HCl (bottom curve) : one intense band at 960 nm, another intense band at 723 nm with three shoulders at 695, 713 and 740 nm. The spectrum at pH = 1 is very similar to that of the aqueous form. From pH 2.5 and above, there is a Red shift of all the bands and a dramatic decrease of intensity. For instance, the band at 960 nm is shifted to 980 nm with significant broadening. However no precipitate of suspension is visible in the solution. At pH = 4.5, a very similar spectrum is observed with no significant change.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> : Spectrophotometric measurements of Np-HEPES solutions at pH = 1.0, 2.5 and 4.5.</p><p>EXAFS measurements of two Np-HEPES solutions at pH = 2.5 and 4.5 show significant changes with respect to aqueous Np(IV) and the appearance of a long range contribution that may be attributed to Np-Np interactions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectra together with best fit metrical parameters. As suggested by the spectrophotometric measurements, no difference occurs between the two pH values. Comparison of the fitted metrical parameters with the crystal structure of [Np 2 (OH) 10 NH 4 ] n finds some similarities (on the average 9 O at 2.33 Å and 3 Np at 3.87 Å around each Np [1]). The exact mechanisms of formation and stabilization of the Np-HEPES clusters in solution is still not known as well as the molecular weight of the edifice. In addition, slow oxidation of Np(IV) into Np(V) has been observed but not quantified. This oxidation occurs typically over few hours and increases with pH. A XANES and EXAFS measurement of the post mortem solution of Np-HEPES at pH = 4 and after 30 days clearly shows the presence of {NpO 2 + } in the aqueous form (2 Oyle at 1.82</p><p>(1) Å, σ 2 = 0.0005 Å 2 and 5 Oeq at 2.50(1) Å, σ 2 = 0.0069 Å 2 ). This result suggests the reversible state of these clusters in solution. In the future we shall perform complementary pH metric data with in situ spectrophotometric measurements in order to rationalize the speciation (and stoechiometry) of these species.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>The solution of Np(IV) in HCl has been obtained by reduction of Np(V) with NH 3 OHCl. EXAFS measurements have been carried out post mortem. An aliquot of the above solution has been diluted in HEPES solution (14 µl of [Np] = 0.216 M in HCl at about 1M in 286 µl of HEPES solution at 0.25 M) and adjusted at designated pH with ammonia (called Np-HEPES in the text). The final Np concentration was 0.010 M. A spectrophotometric control of the solution has been carried out before and after sample measurement at the synchrotron, ensuring that no change of neptunium oxidation state has occurred during this time. EXAFS measurements were performed 4 hours after sample preparation.</figDesc></figure>
