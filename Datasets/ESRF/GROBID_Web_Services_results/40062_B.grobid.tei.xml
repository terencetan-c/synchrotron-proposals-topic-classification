<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this experiment was to see the change in the electronic band structure of NiO as a function of pressure, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy. The measured signal was the dd excitation spectrum. The spectra consist of excitations in an energy-transfer range 0-4 eV, due to transitions between occupied and unoccupied Ni 3d bands, which are partly hybridized with O 2p.</p><p>The experiment was performed on ID16 using photon energies at the Ni K edge. The incident beam was monochromated to a bandwidth of 80 meV at 8.3 keV and focused using a toroidal mirror on the sample in a spot of 40×140 µm. The sample was NiO powder enclosed in a diamond anvil cell and a beryllium gasket, using nitrogen as a pressure-transmitting medium. Both ingoing and observed outgoing beams passed through the Be gasket, the scattering angle being 90 • . The spectrum of scattered x-rays was analysed using a diced Si(551) analyser crystal and a photon-counting Medipix 2D detector <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The spectrometer operated in a Rowland geometry with diameter of 1 m. The total energy resolution was chosen to be 150 meV.</p><p>NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock-salt structure but below the Néel temperature (T N = 523 K) it has a small trigonal distortion from the perfect cubic symmetry due to the antiferromagnetic interaction. The cubic crystal field splits the 3d orbitals into two braches, e and t 2 sets separated by an energy given by the crystal-field parameter 10Dq, assuming purely atomic localized levels. There are three clearly visible wellseparated dd excitations in this case, one at 10Dq ≈ 1 eV, and two around 1.7 and 3 eV in ambient conditions <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The trigonal distortion splits the t 2 levels but not the e in a purely atomic picture.</p><p>A splitting of the unoccupied e orbitals would be visible in the resonances of the two excitation symmetries. This kind of effect has been indeed observed in a previous experiment performed with a single crystal <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Theoretical investigations of the band structure of <ref type="bibr">NiO [3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref> have indeed predicted a nondegeneracy of the e bands already in ambient conditions, with increasing splitting with an increasing pressure. In practice the results show that RIXS can show promise of a k-selective unoccupied-band mapping method.</p><p>The measurements were done at P = 0, 20 and 55 GPa. The experimental results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. First, we measured the Ni K x-ray absorption spectrum. The left panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a zoom-up to the pre-edge region in different pressures.</p><p>The RIXS measurements were done by tuning the incident photon energy around the pre-edge and measuring the spectra of x-rays emitted by the sample. The resulting 2-dimensional maps of the spectra are also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The very intense broad feature starting at energy transfers &gt; 4 eV is the charge transfer band. At lower energy transfers, the 3 distinguishable dd transitions can be observed. They move to higher energy transfers with increasing pressure, with the highest-energy peak merging to the charge-transfer band at 55 GPa. Most important findings are the ones concerning the resonances of the individual excitations: at P = 0 GPa the powder average shows only a single resonance but with an increasing pressure the resonances start to split due to an increased splitting of the unoccupied e bands. This is in a good agreement with the theoretical band structure behaviour under pressure [3] and suggests an advanced possibility of k-selective RIXS <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> with single crystal samples. A manuscript on these results is under preparation while continuation studies are being planned. [1] Huotari et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 77, 053102 (2006); [2] Huotari et al. Phys. Rev.
