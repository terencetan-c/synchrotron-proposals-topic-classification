<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: The importance of free, low and high molecular weight amino acids and thiols for the complexation of the class B metals Cd and Pb in soils and humic streams Experiment number: EC-320 Beamline: Date of experiment: from: 02-juil-08 to: 08-juil-08 Date of report: 10-oct-08 Shifts: Local contact(s): Pieter Glatzel Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Ulf Skyllberg*, Dept of Forest Ecology and Management, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, SE-90183 Umeå, Sweden Torbjörn Karlsson*, Chemistry Dept, Umeå University, SE-90183 Umeå, Sweden.</p><p>Report: Materials and methods: Natural organic matter (NOM) from a humic stream was upconcentrated and separated into size fractions &lt; 1 000 Da, 1 000 -10 000 Da and 10 000 Da -0.22 µm by use of ultra-filtration (Millipor pellicon II Tangential Flow Filtration) and freeze-out technique. The concentration of free amino acids was analyzed in the original humic stream sample, by HPLC coupled to fluorescence detection. The concentration of oxygen and sulfur functional groups associated to NOM were determined by acid-base titration and S XANES spectroscopy. Two organic soils for which the structures of Cu, MeHg, Hg, Cd and Zn bonded to NOM have been determined in previoues studuies were also included in the study. Freeze-dried samples were added Cd and Pb (as nitrate solutions) yielding metal concentrations in the approximate range 400 -20 000 µg g -1 . The pH-range was 3 -9 with most samples in the range 5 -7. For Cd conventional EXAFS data were collected as total fluorescence yield at the Cd K-edge (26711 eV). For Pb both conventional EXAFS and high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) data were collected in the XANES region at the Pb L III -edge (13035 eV). Data were also collected for Cd and Pb model compounds like oxides, sulfides, amino acids and thiols. HERFD spectra of Pb(II) model compounds were compared to FEFF 8.4 multiple scattering calculations and density of state (DOS) simulations to determine the origins of the spectral features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion:</head><p>Cadmium The uppgrade of ID26 made it possible to collect data with a much improved signal to noise ratio as compared to our experiment conducted in 2003 (experiment ME-602). This will make it possible to extract more information on Cd-NOM structures by including third shell and multiple scattering contributions. Preliminary comparisions of the three size fractions of NOM from the humic stream, suggest that reduced sulphur groups (thiols) are highly involved in the complexation of Cd in the smallest size fraction (&lt; 1 000 Da). In the largest size fraction (10 000 Da -0.22 µm) O/N functional groups are the predominant complexing ligands. This is illustrated by the shift of the major FT peak in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> to higher R (distance between Cd and neareast atom), making it similar to Cd -S associations in cysteine.</p><p>The intermediate size fraction (1 000 -10 000 Da) showed a mixed ligation of thiol -S and O/N ligands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lead</head><p>The complexation of lead to NOM is much more difficult to study than Cd. The reason for this is that Pb show variable and unusually high coordination numbers with O/N ligands. Furthermore, the Pb -O distances show an extremely high incoherence (different distances for each Pb -O bond within a structure). This limits the possibilities for structural determinations using conventional EXAFS. Another limitation of conventional EXAFS is that only data up to 10 k (Å - 1 ) can be used for structural information owing to an interference with the K-edge of Br at13 474 eV (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In addition to conventional EXAFS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), we therefore explored the possibilities of using HERFD XANES (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). As a first step structures of model compounds PbO, PbNO 3 , Pb acetate (PbAc), and PbS were examined. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Interference of Pb L III -edge EXAFS by the Br Kedge at 13 474 eV.</p><p>In contrast to Cd, conventional EXAFS did not reaveal large differences in Pb bonding to different size fractions of NOM in the humic stream. Given that Pb is expected to bind to a combination of O and possibly N (but not to S) functional groups it may be difficult to detect structural differences among size fraction. There was, however, a marked effect of pH (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which seems to be quite similar in all size fractions of NOM. Also the binding environment in the organic soils was highly pH dependent, with distinct features in "k-space". In the organic soils traces of ironhydroxides may contribute to the bonding. Preliminary analysis of Pb model compounds using HERDF XANES reveal differences in peak energies and intensities that can be attributed to S, N and O coordination environments. In the next step HERFD XANES analysis will be applied to our NOM and organic soil samples in order to extract information that could complement the conventional EXAFS analysis.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
