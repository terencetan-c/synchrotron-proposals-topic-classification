<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment's aim was to measure the second order correlation function of a resonant x-ray cavity into which <ref type="bibr">57</ref> Fe atoms had been placed. This is a quantum cavity electrodynamical experiment in the intermediate regime, meaning that the coupling strenght between cavity and 57 Fe nuclei is larger than the decay constant of the nuclei, but smaller than the decay constant of the cavity. Theoretical work indicates that the second-order correlation function of such an intermediate coupling system can display highly non-classical behaviour. Our estimates indicated that the ESRF 4-bunch mode would yield sufficient 2-resonant photon events to satisfy counting statistics. Unfortunately, the experiment failed, for two main reasons: A) We had several concurrent problems with our sample cavities. A production problem occuring during the preparation of the beamtime yielded several cavities of unsatisfactory quality. In particular, the reflectivity was much lower than anticipated. We did not manage to fix the problem meaningfully in the run-up to the experiment. We anticipated that this might turn out to be a problem, and brought several older cavities used in previous experiments along, but these turned out to display a hyperfine splitting of the 57 Fe, which also would have spoiled, or at least encumbered the experiment. We hence stuck with an inferior-reflectivity sample, leading to many fewer counts than anticipated in the proposal. B) We had recurring problems with the setup used to record the incident photons. In our zeal to measure as many photons as possible, we had minimized the veto time of the APDs. About halfway through the experiment, when taking a first look at the data (the analysis took somewhat longer since the data was taken with a custom setup) we noticed that there was a gap of about 10 ns after the veto, in which the first diode had measured nothing, probably due to the CFD being overwhelmed. Since the vast majority of delayed photons arrive very early on, this drastically reduced the signal. Photon pairs where both photons arrived within this time (or the veto) were not recorded at all; photon pairs where only the first photon had arrived within that time, or where the second had been logged by a different APD, were not identifiable as pairs in post-processing.</p><p>Having fixed this issue by omitting the CFD and feeding the signal of three APDs directly into the ADC, we noticed, again somewhat later, that the Start signals were not logged any more. This meant that photon counting events were not assignable to a single bunch, which meant in turn that only those photon pairs could be identified that had been measured by the same diode -photon pairs where one had been detected at time A by APD 1 and the other at time B by APD 2 were not identifiable as photon pairs, which also strongly suppressed the 2-photon count rate.</p><p>A third issue arose when the other two were fixed. There was some uncertainty on our part what the best cavity detuning (i.e. angular setting) was. The setting where the second order correlation function displayed the largest non-classicality would not necessarily be identical to the one where the count rate was largest. We tried to navigate this problem by making measurements at different angular settings, spreading the remaining experimental times between two settings. Unfortunately, it turned out that there were simply too few 2-photon events to get meaningful results in the remaining time; having different settings (which would return different second order correlation fucntions) only excacerbated the problem. No meaningful second-order correlation function could be measured at all in the end; not to speak of measuring whether it exceeded non-classicality bounds.</p></div>			</div>
