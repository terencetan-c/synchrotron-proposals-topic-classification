<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the following we report on the results of our last run.We already described, in the previous Experimental Report, the relevant results from our previous activity at ESRF on the same beam line, based on the shifts assigned by ESRF Review Committee to our project CH-163, on promoted Rh supported catalysts. These results have been part of a graduation thesis and a paper based on them has just been submitted to the Applied Catalysis.</p><p>We made use of the nine shifts assigned to project CH-220 to investigate, by in situ EXAFS in transmission mode (Si(311) double crystal monochromator), rhodium catalysts obtained by anchoring the organocomplexes [(sulphos)Rh(cod)] and [(sulphos)Rh(CO)2] on the silica surface with a metal loading of 1.5wt.%. The samples have been treated and measured inside our furnace-cell which allows for loading (in a dry-box) and transferring of air-sensitive samples, heating up to 5OO°C, quick air cooling and gas treatments. Some work is still due to set-up the already existent liquid Nz cooling system, because of geometric constraints of the experimental Gilda chamber.</p><p>Spectra were collected at the Rh K-edge, with the coaddition of 3 complete scans per sample, in order to perform a statistical analysis of the data. Due to a temporary breakdown of the monochromator flat crystal, dynamical focusing was not possible, with a coseguent highly variable beam spot dimension during the scans. Still exafs spectra were of satisfactory quality up to 13.&amp;-l, where the edge jumps were of about 0.2 a.u.</p><p>In order to better resolve the cumbersome structure of the [(sulphos)Rh(cod)] and [(sulphos)Rh(CO)z] complex exafs signal, to which a many shells scattering contributes, many reference Rh compounds of known crystallographic structure, which have either phenyl-phosphyne or cod/CO ligands, have also been analysed.</p><p>after the impregnation onto the silica the [(sulphos)Rh(cod)] complex is deposited intact on the surface; this strongly suggest that the grafting occurs through the sulphonated tail, probably with the hydroxil surface groups (in agreement with the higher precursor loading observed when the silica is outgassed at lower temperatures). The reduction in hydrogen removes the cod ligand without originating formation of contiguous Rh-Rh sites but inducing the lengthen of one of the Rh-P distance (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> by the FT spectra comparison). This fact supports the hypotesis that in heterogeneous phase isolate sites of Rh(1) are not active for the hydroformylation reaction. Probably, due to the highly reduced mobility on the support surface, the reversible opening of a phosphin arm, mechanism accounted for the hydroformylation activity of this complex in the homogeneous phase, is prevented. The carbonylation at room temperature of the reduced sample originates spectra whose initial analysis suggests the presence of only one carbonyl ligand, while after prolonged contact with the CO:Hz mixture at 120°C (reaction temperature), the spectra very much resemble those of the just impregnated [(sulphos)Rh(CO)z]/SiOz. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> the comparison is shown among the FT spectra of the pure cabonyl complex, the silica supported carbonyl complex and the supported cod complex after reductive cod elimination and re-carbonylation at room temperature. Successive exposure to NZ and 02 at temperatures up to 15O°C demonstrated the high thermal stability of the supported carbonyl complex, in agreement with the FT-IR data and with the hypothesis that the preferential coordination of CO on Rh sites acts as a poison in the hydroformylayion reaction.</p></div>		</body>
