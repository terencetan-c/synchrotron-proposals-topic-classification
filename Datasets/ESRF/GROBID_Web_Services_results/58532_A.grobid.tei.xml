<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The ability to obtain spectroscopic information at a nanometer scale could lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of catalysis. Of particular interest is the local chemical state of catalysts during operation. Synchrotron X-ray scanning tunneling microscopy (SXSTM) may be able to provide such information. In a SXSTM measurement, the enhancement of the tunneling current induced by X-rays is measured. In vacuum, it was shown that this signal depends so strongly on the local X-ray absorption coefficient that nanometer resolution chemical maps can be obtained 1 . Based on our experiences in HC1754, we developed a methodology to perform SXSTM measurements in a gas environment. In HC2291, we succesfully tested this combined X-ray absortion and scanning tunneling microscopy instrument (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).  To suppress the collection of the ion currents that are generated in the gas phase by photoelectrons, coaxially coated STM tips were used (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The conductive outer shield of the coaxial tips can be biased to deflect ions away from the tip core. From figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> it is clear that the coaxial coating of the tip largely removes the background current, bringing it to a manageable regime. In tunneling contact, the X-ray-induced current needs to be separated from the regular topographic tunneling current in order to perform height feedback while obtaining the X-rayinduced signal. As the integration of our STM with ID03's flow chamber does not permit complete electronic shielding and vibrational isolation, the height feedback system needs to have a high-speed response. We have therefore developed a novel X-ray/topo current separation scheme, that allows us to perform stable scanning while obtaining the X-rayinduced current (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). Finally, we have measured the X-ray-induced current on Au(111) in 800 mbar Ar as a function of topographic tunneling current (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). The clear correlation proves that we are truly sensitive to the X-ray-induced enhancement of the tunneling probability, which is the underlying mechanism that provides local chemical contrast. Thus, our measurements have opened the way to in situ chemical mapping of model catalysts. A manuscript based on the results described above is in preparation. [1] N.
