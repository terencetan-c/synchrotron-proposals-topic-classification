<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Staphylococcal exotoxin 1 (sET1) is a member of a newly discovered family of superantigen related proteins from Staphylococcal aureus. Superantigens in general interact with MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors in a non-peptide dependent manner, thus eliciting a massive cytokine response from a wide rage of T-lymphocytes, resulting in a range of disease. Experiments with sET1 have failed to elicit this response from T-cells to date, and this protein may thus be able to shed light on the evolution of these toxins, and perhaps on the origin of their function, since utility of a large scale immune response for the bacteria's viability is still unclear.</p><p>SET1 is a 24 kDa, 230 residue protein which contains no cysteines and only a single methionine, it has, at best, 24% identity to any known structure. Structure solution is being attempted by standard multiple isomorphous replacement methods. Crystals grow readily using PEG 2k as a precipitant, buffered at pH 8.0 with 0.1M Tricine in the presence of 0.1 M Lithium sulphate. The crystals are in spacegroup P4 1/3 2 1 2, with cell dimensions a=b=81.7 Å, c=148.0 Å, there are probably 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. Prevoiusly, crystals formed near-perfect twins (in different crystallisation conditions) which are not detectable from crystal morphology. The new crystallisation conditions (outlined above) gave untwinned crystals, and a native dataset has been obtained to 2.75 Å. Two heavy atom derivatives were being screened during this beamtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>A Platinum Chloride derivative dataset was collected. This diffracted to 2.85 Å, and was processed in MOSFLM/Scala. This gave an R sym = 0.106, with an overall completeness of 99.9%, and an I/δI of 4.6. Space group was determined as P4 1/3 2 1 2, with unit cell dimensions of a=b=81 Å, c=147 Å. However, examination of the dataset for heavy atoms was unsucessful, and no phase information could be gained.</p></div>		</body>
