<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction: scientific background and objectives</head><p>Manganese is an essential micro-nutrient for all organisms, but it can become toxic to soil organisms at high concentrations. Manganese redox states range between 0 and +7, with +2, +3 and +4 the most commonly encountered redox states in natural environments. In soil, Mn III and Mn IV occur as insoluble oxides. At low pH or under reduced conditions, Mn II is the stable form which has much higher solubility than Mn III/IV . The Mn redox chemistry therefore plays an important role in Mn uptake and bioavailability. Because of its complex chemistry, Mn speciation is difficult to study. Sample preparation, e.g. drying, may alter the speciation. Synchrotron techniques can be used with minimal disturbance of the sample. Therefore, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has been used to obtain information on Mn oxidation states in soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Guest et al., 2002)</ref>, but no attempt was yet made to relate the speciation to bioavailability. In this experiment, the oxidation state of Mn in soils was determined with XANES in three soils with different treatments. The measurements were carried out at beamline BM26a (DUBBLE). The aim of our study is to relate the chemical speciation of Mn to its availability and toxicity. The experiment is part of a large project within the framework of the environmental risk of Mn in Europe in order to fulfill the European REACH regulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>• Soils and soil treatments. In total, there were 36 soil samples: -3 soils: Kasterlee ('K', sandy soil, pH 4.7, 1.7% organic C (OC), 150 mg Mn/kg); Woburn ('W', pH 6.1, 4.3% OC, 370 mg Mn/kg); Ter Munck ('T', 1.1% OC, pH 6.7, 460 mg Mn/kg) -2 Mn rates: without or with addition of MnCl 2 , at a dose near the EC50 for plant growth (=concentration where plant growth is reduced with 50% compared to control). After the MnCl 2 addition, soils were air dried and stored for 2 months. -6 incubation scenarios:</p><p>-incubated at field capacity (=not water saturated) for 7 days -incubated water saturated for 7 days at 20°C, without or with addition of (5%) peat or (1 g/kg) hay -incubated water saturated for 2 months without or with addition of (5%) peat</p><p>The effect of organic matter is assessed because organic matter plays a key role in driving redox reactions in soil.</p><p>• XANES measurements and data analysis. The XANES data were collected at BM26 (DUBBLE). The BM26 beamline uses a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator to select the energy of the X-rays, and a ninechannel monolithic Ge detector to collect the fluorescence radiation. The signal was measured at the Mn K edge. The soil samples were measured in fluorescence mode. Reference samples were measured in transmission mode, and for a few samples also in fluorescence mode. Spectra were recorded from 130 eV below to 550 eV above the Mn K edge (∼6550 eV), using 0.5-eV steps in the edge region. A Cr filter was used for fluorescence measurements, to reduce the scattering background. Depending on the Mn concentration of the sample, 2 to 10 replicate scans were made.</p><p>The wet soil samples were mounted between two sheets of Kapton tape, using a metal sample holder with window. The soils at field capacity were wetted to saturation immediately before the measurement, to obtain more homogeneity and conditions similar to those of the saturated soils. For one sample, the spectra were also recorded at field capacity, and it was found that wetting the sample did not cause a shift in the spectrum.</p><p>The reference samples were pressed in pellets with a thickness of 0.6 mm after dilution with BN to a concentration yielding an edge step of circa 1. Reference compounds included MnCl 2 •4H 2 O, MnO, Mn 3 O 4 , Mn 2 O 3 , MnPO 4 and MnO 2 , as well as natural Mn minerals: rhodonite (MnSiO 3 ), rhodocrosite (MnCO 3 ), manganite (MnOOH), psilomelane (Ba(Mn 2+ )(Mn 4+ ) 8 O 16 (OH) 4 ) and pyrolusite (MnO 2 ). The spectra were averaged and normalized. Reference compounds to carry out linear combination fitting (LCF) were selected based on principal component analysis and target transformation; only one compound was selected if spectra were similar (e.g. Mn 2 O 3 and MnOOH). Following reference spectra were used for the LCF: rhodocrosite (MnCO 3 ), MnSO 4 (from the Lytle database), Mn 2 O 3 and MnO 2 .</p><p>• Toxicity tests and chemical tests. Plant assays (2 weeks growth) were carried out on the three soils amended with MnCl 2 . The soils were at field capacity during the whole growth period or saturated for 7 days before harvest. The chemical analyses included determination of total (hot acid digestion), extractable (NH 4 Ac pH 3, and CaCl 2 10 mM), and soil solution Mn, and measurement of the Mn diffusion flux with DGT (Diffusive Gradient in Thin films).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>To assess whether no beam damage occurred, a series of five quickscans (100 s) was run on one soil sample.</p><p>No shift in the spectrum was observed. However, when five consecutive normal scans (15 min) were run, a small shift in the spectrum towards lower energies was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This was also reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ross et al. (2001)</ref>, who attributed this to reduction of the Mn oxides, with soil organic matter presumably acting as electrondonor. However, the change was minor compared to the difference between samples, and carrying out the LCF on the first, last and average of five scans indicated that this shift had only a minor effect on the estimated Mn oxidation state (at most 0.05 difference in average oxidation state). For all samples, at most (and mostly less than) five consecutive scans on the same spot were run, and the beam damage should therefore have had negligible effects on the overall results.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the normalized spectra of the reference compounds used in the LCF and of selected soil samples. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives the LCF results for all samples. Both visual observation and the LCF results indicated the predominance of Mn II in soil K (all treatments) and in all soils that were water saturated for 2 months. In the MnCl 2 amended soils at field capacity, Mn II dominated in soil W, but Mn III/IV dominated in soil T, indicating that oxidation of the added Mn II salt occurred in soil T (during the 2-months dry storage and 7-days incubation at FC), but not in soil W. Addition of hay promoted reduction of Mn III/IV , but addition of peat surprisingly seemed to slow down the reduction rate, as indicated by the lower Mn II fractions for the peat treatments compared to the corresponding treatment without peat.</p><p>The plant experiment showed that Mn in the plant was proportional to the Mn concentration in soil solution. A 50% yield reduction occurred at an internal shoot concentration of 4000 mg Mn/kg dry weight or at a pore water concentration of circa 480 mg/liter (all soils) or at a total Mn concentration in soil of between 500 (low pH soil) and 2000 mg Mn/kg (high pH soil). Differences in toxicity between soils and treatments could be related to differences in speciation, but were generally small, since most added MnCl 2 remained as Mn II in the toxic range. These results are currently being written up for publication.
