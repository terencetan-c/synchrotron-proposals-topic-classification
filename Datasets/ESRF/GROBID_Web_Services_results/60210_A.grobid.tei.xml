<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment requested about 3 shifts for installation and beamline alignment. Initially, issues related to the liquid pumping unit were encountered. The XAS spectra were affected by the pulsing of the peristaltic pump, which was replaced by a syringe pump (used in the past for similar experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Additionally, initial in situ experiments were affected by inappropriate degassing of the solution that resulted in bubbles, whose presence could be recognized in the XAS spectra by the loss of intensity at repeated intervals. Once this issue could be fixed (2nd day) the quality of the spectra (30-40 s/spectrum) at the Pd K-edge (24.35 keV) was good and analysis could be pushed to 12-13 Å -1 . The purpose of the experiment was to analyze the influence of the presence of a solvent (50 vol% H 2 O/50 vol% ethanol) on the oxidation state of Pd-based catalysts. Previous experiments had shown that this mixture is able to reduce supported PdO, the PdO particle size being critical <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this experiment, various metal oxide supports have been tested, including Al 2 O 3 , Al 2 O 3 /CeZrO 2 and LaFeO 3 in order to monitor the state of Pd as a function of the stability of the Pd-O bond in such catalysts. Because these kind of catalysts can be used in synthesis reactions, e.g. C-C coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>, we have additionally followed the state of Pd upon addition of a base (0.1 M K 2 CO 3 ) to the solvent: an additional element ubiquitous to C-C coupling catalysis The experiments consisted in a heating ramp from ambient temperature to 80°C at 1°C/min while measuring quickEXAFS spectra as a function of temperature and of position within the catalyst bed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For this purpose, the cell was moved repeatedly in order to obtain EXAFS spectra in 9 different positions within the bed to monitor the evolution of any reduction gradients. This is the reason of the slow temperature ramp. While we were able to confirm previous measurements obtained on independent Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalysts, we decided to study a commercially available and reduced 5 wt% Pd/Al 2 O 3 following this protocol. EXAFS showed that this material is in its native state comprised of very small and ostensibly reduced Pd nanoparticles (ca. 10-20 atoms). The same catalyst was calcined at 500°C for 5 h to yield an equivalent PdO sample allowing us to compare two different starting structures of the Pd component. The small reduced Pd particles were found to increase in size as of ca. 40-50°C; the PdO based sample reduced only at temperatures in excesss of 70°C. Addition of 0.1 M K 2 CO 3 to the solvent mixture had two effects. First, it caused a retardation in the PdO reduction of calcined Pd/Al 2 O 3 by ca. 20°C. Second, the intensity of the edge jump increased measurably while moving to the end of the catalyst bed within the cell while it decreased at the inlet (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). This strongly suggests the induction of a mass transport of Pd along the bed as a result of the addition of the K 2 CO 3 . Beside Pd/Al 2 O 3 , reduction was measured in the case of LaFeO 3 -based catalysts as well. In the absence of K 2 CO 3 , the oxidised Pd present did not reduce. However, in the presence of K 2 CO 3 reduction of the PdO was again evidenced as was considerable loss of absolute edge-jump intensity as an axial function of the bed position. Again therefore the base appears to induce a leaching of the Pd in the absence of any halogenated component in the solvent mixture. We note that this material was previosuly shown to promote Suzuki C-C coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> and that both Pd reduction, the strong structural changes observed in the support, and Pd leaching were attributed to the presence of the aryl halide reactant of the reaction scheme. Our measurements show that, at tenfold lower concentrations of the base used for that reaction, i.e. K 2 CO 3 , and in the absence of the aryl halide reduction of octahedral Pd and its solubilisation can occur under relatively mild conditions.</p><p>The EXAFS measurements will be complemented by transmission electron microscopy measurement of the fresh and used samples. In a preliminary measurement, TEM could verify the detachment of Pd particles (ca. 3-4 nm) from Al 2 O 3 in the presence of K 2 CO 3 . Additionally, two distinct structures are evident in the TEM image of LaFePdO 3 identically treated, which suggest the destruction of the LaFeO 3 structure associated with reduction of octahedral Pd. The data collected on Pd/Al 2 O 3 are being summarized in a scientific publication. Extensive data evaluation of the EXAFS data is ongoing. H. Emerich is greatly acknowledged for his support during the allocated beamtime. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
