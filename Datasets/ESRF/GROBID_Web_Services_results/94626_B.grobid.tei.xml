<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective &amp; expected results (less than 10 lines)</p><p>The goal of our experiment was to study the evolution of magnetic properties of ultrathin (2.5-40 nm) antiferromagnetic YFeO3 wedged films on r-Al2O3 substrates in the 4 -190 K temperature range and under the action of the external magnetic field by X-ray reflectivity and Mössbauer reflectivity spectra. Mossbauer technique is known to be the best probe for local magnetization, providing information about hyperfine magnetic fields and its orientation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study (main part)</head><p>Wedge-shaped YFeO3 films with 95% Fe 57 enrichment on the r-Al2O3 substrates with thickness 40-23 nm, 23-8 nm, 11-6 nm, 7-3 nm, and 4.1-2.5 nm were prepared by magnetron sputtering and ex-situ postannealing in air at 800C for 3h.</p><p>Low temperature (3.5 -191K) synchrotron Mössbauer and reflectivity investigations were carried out for the angles of incidence of synchrotron beam in the range of 0.12-0.20 deg., and in applied magnetic field of up to 3.6 Tesla.</p><p>Many unexpected results were obtained. First measurements showed rather complicated thickness dependences of the Mössbauer reflectivity spectra, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The observed unexpected result is the two sextets (with the hyperfine fields of ~54 T and ~45 T) in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a) and (d), while the bulk YFeO3 material is characterized by the sole hyperfine field <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. That clearly points to the presence of the secondary phase of unknown nature in our films. Mössbauer reflectivity spectra demonstrate different behavior upon variation of the applied magnetic field and temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (a) and (b)). For thicker film, the application of magnetic field increases the splitting for higher hyperfine field, but deceases it for smaller sextet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (a)</ref>).</p><p>For thinner film temperature rise results in complete collapse of splitting only for one sextet (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (b)). In addition, the external magnetic field resulted in reorientation of vector of weak ferromagnetism from the normal to the film plane. Such reorientation is more pronounced for thicker films. Several very important questions related to the explanation of the unexpected results remain. The most important one is the nature of the second hyperfine field: it is either the second phase, or the strained layers at the interface, or nanosized islands in the thinnest films. Does yttrium give any magnetic contribution? Additional structural and Mössbauer investigations are required.</p><p>XRD structural characterization can be done at the ID31beamline to determine structural distortions in nanosized YFeO3 films as well as a possible existence of additional phases.</p><p>Beamline ID12 can be used for both XLMD and XANES measurements at the L2,3 edges of Y. They may permit to identify the Y induced magnetic moment and its role in anisotropic magnetic exchange.</p><p>Additional depth resolved Mössbauer reflectivity investigations at ID18 might clarify the evolution of magnetic properties with temperature and magnetic field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>During the beam time, we have measured about 100 Mössbauer reflectivity spectra revealing a complicated variation of magnetization as a function of the film thickness and experimental parameters (angle of incidence of synchrotron beam, temperature, magnetic field). Measurements of Mössbauer reflectivity spectra in wider angular range ae needed for the depth selection of the existing phases in our films in order to clarify the role of the film stress on the magnetic and structural parameters of our YFeO3 orthoferrite. These measurements provided high-quality data for quantitative analysis of Mössbauer and reflectivity spectra to get the principal physical parameters as a function of angle of incidence, film thickness, temperature, and magnetic field. Anyhow additional detailed Mössbauer, structural, and magnetic measurements will provide a better understanding and accuracy of the quantitative results. These experiments are original in the antiferromagnetic community and give important outputs for understanding evolution of magnetic properties of ultrathin films the development of advanced devices for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
