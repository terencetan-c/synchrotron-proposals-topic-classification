<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>substrate by transducer a thick (8 mm) Si crystal has been used as BFL-transducer interface. The X-ray total reflected power (TRP) was registered with PIN-diode detector and the beam size of few millimeter squares. By this means the acoustic spectrum of the vibrating system has been obtained, which allowed to pick out the optimal resonant frequency. Next the dependence of the TRP on the amplitude of a signal applied to the transducer has been measured. The voltage amplitude was scanned within the range of O-3 V for the ultrasound frequency of about 12 MHz corresponding to one of the resonant peaks in the TRP spectrum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</p><p>For the characterization of the X-ray focusing properties of BFL undergoing ultrasonic excitation a 10 ~m pinhole has been scanned in the focal plane by means of two mutually perpendicular micropositioners. The radiation transmitted through the pinhole was registered with Si PIN-diode detector. The plots shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref> clearly demonstrate that ultrasound excitation of the circular BFL allows to increase the X-ray flux in BFL focus by a factor of 2 which is very close to the theoretical limit. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The piezoelectric transducer has been pasted to the back side of the thick crystal with lowmelting organic glue meanwhile the BFL substrate has been attached, one polished face to another, by means of non-solidified adhesive emulsion. The 36° Y-cut Lithium Niobate transducer with fundamental frequency of about 30 MHz has generated the quasilongitudinal ultrasound wave with wave vector perpendicular to the crystal surface. The basic experimental parameters are: incident radiation energy E=9.89 keV, reflection Si (555), Bragg angle e~=87° and BFL focal distance is F=62.5 cm. Taking into account the demagnification factor of 64, the focal spot size produced by BFL can be estimated as to be 2.3x3.9 ~m2.</figDesc></figure>
