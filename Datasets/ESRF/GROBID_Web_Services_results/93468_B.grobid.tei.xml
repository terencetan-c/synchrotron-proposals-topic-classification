Despite the limitation for single particle cryo-EM has been the low signal-to-noise ratio due to the protein size. Our preliminary sample preparation analysis revealed good quality 2D class-averages (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>), before data collection on the Titan Krios beam CM01.</p><p>From the 4 grids sent to ESRF, we selected for data collection the one with best ice quality that was prepared with apo-protein. In the initial collected images analysis on session MX2263-5, possible particles were detected. But after pre-processing data, 2D classes did not show DrPolI particles (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Different picking methods were used from Scipion and cryoSPARC. Based on the 2D classification results, we consider that the grid was "empty" or almost "empty".</p><p>Unfortunately, a problem in the EM sample preparation was not detected in the early steps of data collection due to the difficulty to detect this protein. The expected size of DrPolI monomer is 9-10 nm. MX2263-6 -Regulation and target selection for DNA transposition (Ernesto Arias-Palomo) Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2263-6 5-7/03/2021 3,078 137,787 46 1.052 1 DNA transposons are nucleic acid fragments that can transfer horizontally between different DNA molecules. This activity can modify gene expression, promote organismal evolution, and spread antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. How transposable elements are regulated has been a long-standing question, however. Notably, transposase control often relies on nucleotide cofactors to regulate transposase activity or to choose appropriate target DNAs.</p><p>Here we are studying IS21, one of the most widespread families of transposons, which is composed of a canonical DDE transposase, IstA, and an essential ATPase regulator, IstB. We have previously determined that IstB forms decamers that sharply bend short fragments of DNA. However, we have recently observed that IstB can form higher-order filaments/oligomers</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESRF BAG report</head><p>The Iberian cryo-EM Community BAG on longer DNA substrates, reminiscent of those formed by the Mu and Tn7 regulators MuB and TnsC.</p><p>In this experiment we have analysed the structure of IstB bound to a large duplex DNA (120 bp). This complex form elongated filament-like structures that offer a limited range of views, and we collected some tilted images (1963 images out of 3078 were collected at 35º) to alleviate this issue. We picked the particles using Topaz, and after several rounds of 2D and 3D</p><p>classification we have been able to obtain a 4.4 Å resolution structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We are still processing the data but in the current state we are already able to model the protein and the DNA using our previous results. Notably, this structure provides key insights that help to understand the molecular determinants of the nucleic acid in this process and how IstB primes the target DNA to promote the strand transfer reaction. </p></div>

(Vicente Rubio and Clara Marco-Marín)</head><p>Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2263-7 23-25/04/2021 4767 249.405 42 1.05 1</p><p>P5CSD is due to decrease or loss-of-function mutations in the bifunctional enzyme P5CS, an oligomer of a single polypeptide with two catalytic domains (one per reaction) that catalyse the first two steps of de novo synthesis of both ornithine and proline. Interestingly, we found that this genetic disorder presents a puzzling variety of four genetic syndromes defined by a combination of their clinical manifestations and their type of inheritance, dominant or recessive. The type of inheritance and the type of syndrome depend on the mutation(s)</p><p>present. We have interpreted the disease as a single continuum of severity and the dominance of some mutations as dominant negative effects that would result from disturbed structural organization of the enzyme oligomer with impaired channelling of the intermediate and unstable product, glutamate-5-phosphate from the kinase to the reductase domain of adjacent subunits.</p><p>In order to understand such channelling, and also to clarify the mechanism of the negative dominance in the P5CS mutation-associated disease spectrum, we determined the structure for the apo form of human P5CS at 3.4 Å overall resolution which forms tetramers organized</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESRF BAG report</head><p>The Iberian cryo-EM Community BAG as dimers of dimers, and that can associate into octamers (4.23 Å) and dodecamers (4.68 Å).</p><p>To better delineate the P5CS active centers, we prepared samples of P5CS in the presence of substrates or substrate analogs, hoping to be able to visualize some loops with no density in the maps for the apo structure that are expected to be involved in the binding of substrates, that could facilitate the understanding of P5CS functioning particularly of the intermediate channelling.</p><p>From these samples we collected 4767 images from which we extracted 249.405 particles after 2D-classification. Analysis of these revealed that the protein had a preferential orientation, with most of the particles corresponding to top views where only one of the catalytic domains (reductase domain) can be seen. Interestingly, in our previous structure of the apo form of P5CS, this particular view was rare to be seen and in consequence the local resolution for this domain was not better than ~ 4,5-5 Å. So, in order to boost the resolution of this particular domain we decided to combine the particles from this dataset and from our previous dataset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) and we obtained a map with better resolution for the reductase component, allowing us to refine the position of some secondary structure elements of the reductase domain. We are currently finishing the analysis of the structures and in the process of manuscript preparation. MX2263-8 -Cryo-EM characterization of the histone modifying complex (Oscar Llorca) Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2363-8 14-16/05/2021 7283 631K 45 1.052 1 Chromatin remodelling regulates the dynamic balance between genome packaging and accessibility, through the concerted action of chromatin remodelers and histone-modifying enzymes. The histone modifications specifically recruit other proteins, dictating whether particular regions of chromatin are actively transcribed or are held in an inactive state. Thus, specific histone modifications are crucial for transcription initiation and elongation, as well as DNA repair. Moreover, aberrant histone modifications can impact cell cycle progression, apoptosis, tumorigenesis and stem cell differentiation. Despite the intensive research on the histone modification machinery, its structure and the molecular mechanisms driving its specificity are still unclear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESRF BAG report</head><p>The Iberian cryo-EM Community BAG</p><p>In this session we collected a dataset on a histone-modification complex. 7283 movies were collected, motion corrected, and automatically picked with Topaz software yielding a pool of 631K particles. To deal with the conformational and compositional heterogeneity of the dataset, specific image processing software was used, such as Relion, cryoSPARC and CryoDRGN. This approach yielded a 3D reconstruction of the NCP complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) that shows an extra density bound to the protein nucleosome face and the DNA in a flexible manner. We are currently improving the quality of the cryo-EM model to dissect the interactions involved, which will be the subject of a manuscript in preparation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MX2263-9 -Rotavirus group A vDLP polymerase VP1 loaded (Daniel Luque)</head><p>Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2263-9 21-23/06/2021 8,961 58,268 50 0.675 2</p><p>One of the aims of our laboratory is the study of the structural variability in the Rotavirus (RV) genus. RV is the main causative agent of infectious gastroenteritis in infants and young children in developed and developing countries. RV are divided into 9 different groups named alphabetically from RVA to RVI. The RVA, B, C and H. Most of the information that is available about RV has been obtained from the study of the RVA, since the RV of other groups present problems of adaptation to in vitro growth, which in many cases has not yet been developed.</p><p>The expression of the structural proteins of RV belonging to the B, C, D, F, G, H, and I groups, allow us to obtain VLP of these RV. The structure of these VLP will be similar to the structure of the particles obtained during the viral infection. The determination of their structure at atomic or near-atomic resolution will allow us to know for the first time the structure of the reference viruses of the different RV groups, analyse their structural variability, where should reside the differences of tropism and host of these viruses.</p><p>During the MX2263-9 session we collected, using the K3 direct detector in super resolution mode, ~9K good quality movies of control RVA vDLPs loaded with the VP1 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. After movie averaging and dose weighting ~58 K particles where selected and extracted. 2D and 3D classification was performed to select ~52K particles datasets that after 3D refinement have rendered a 3.3 Å resolution density map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). At the moment, the presence and structure of non-symmetric components (VP1) are being analysed by symmetry relaxation and localize 3DR. MX2263-10 -Structural characterization of the 26S:Bag1 complex by CryoE (Jose María Valpuesta)</p><p>Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2363-10 30-02/07/21 14079 1,600,000 40 0.65 2</p><p>We have biochemically and biophysically determined that the cochaperone Bag1, a cofactor that tunes the activity of Hsp70 chaperones, is able to interact with the proteasome and drive the Hsp70-bound substrate to degradation. We have also found that the proteasome subunit Rpn1 is the one that connects Bag1 with the proteasome. We have prepared a complex between the 26S proteosome and Bag1 (26S:Bag1). After that, the sample was vitrified, and a large dataset was acquired in a FEI Titan Krios cryo-electron microscope.</p><p>A total of 14079 movies were recorded, and 1,600,000 particles were extracted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>).</p><p>Particles were 2D classified and those with the best signal were selected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref>). Then, particles were 3D classified into 10 classes generated de novo and those classes representing the 26S complex were selected (640000 particles). The 26S particles were subjected to a Homogeneous Refinement that produced a 6.9 Å resolution model (pixel size was 3.3 Å/px at that stage of the processing). Particles were then reextracted with a smaller pixel size (1.6 Å/px), the model was subjected to Relion Postprocess and the map obtained had 3.84 Å resolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref>).</p><p>Since the interaction of Bag1 with the proteasome is mediated by Rpn1, the processing was focused on the area of Rpn1, which unfortunately was one of the areas of the model with less details (arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref>). A circular mask was placed around Rpn1 and a classification without alignment was performed. A total of 6 models were obtained, one of them had a high detailed Rpn1 with an extra mass close to the toroidal part (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6E</ref>, red, dotted circle).</p><p>We're now in the process of further refine the volume and in the meantime, the best correlation with our map was found with the PDB:5VFP that represents a conformation that is prepared for the substrate incoming.
