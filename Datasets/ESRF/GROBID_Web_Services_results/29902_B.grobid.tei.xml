<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The Kondo compound CeAl 2 crystallizes in the cubic Laves phase MgCu 2 , in which the Ce site has two atomic positions in the asymetric unit cell (Ce I and Ce II ), as the carbon atoms in the diamond structure. Its magnetic structure, below T N = 3.8K, is caracterized by a propagation vector k=(1/2+δ, 1/2-δ, 1/2), a propagation vector in two parts: an antiferromagnetic part (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and a modulation part (δ, -δ, 0). This structure was first described by a single k propagation vector, an antiferromagnetic modulated structure. It has then been shown that the structure is double k, with 2 propagation vectors, k 1 =(1/2+δ, 1/2-δ, 1/2) and k 2 =(1/2+δ, 1/2-δ, -1/2), which share the modulation part (δ, -δ, 0), but with different directions for the antiferromagnetic propagation: (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2, -1/2). Such a double k structure corresponds for the two Ce sites of the asymmetric unit cell to two helices with opposite chiralities. These helices are elliptic, which means that some magnetic moments are reduced compared to the others (the Kondo effect).</p><p>We have used the synchrotron radiation to search displacement waves resulting from the onset of the magnetic structure. To do that, we were guided by group theory which tells us which kind of Fourier coefficient u k can be expected from magneto-elastic energy terms which are quadratic in m k and linear in u k . As the magnetic structure of CeAl 2 is double k, there are 3 possibilities for the displacement waves: -the classical displacement with a propagation vector which is the double of the magnetic propagation vector:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k = ±2 k 1 or k = ±2 k 2 .</formula><p>-two propagation vectors which couple the two different propagation vectors of the magnetic structure: k = ±( k 1 + k 2 ) and k = ±( k 1 -k 2 ). We have found the satellites of the usual propagation vector 2k (table <ref type="table">I</ref>). We have also found, though one order of magnitude less intense, the satellites due to the propagation vectors k 1 +k 2 (table <ref type="table">II</ref>). But, concerning contributions corresponding to the propagation k 1 -k 2 , we have looked for 8 reflections (table <ref type="table">III</ref>) which were all measured zero, except for one of them, reflection (5 0 1). Going back to the group G k 1 -k 2 = G (001 , with the operators of the space group which leave the vector k 1 -k 2 = (0, 0, 1) invariant, it appears that it has no trivial representation, and therefore that no monomial of type m -k 1 m k 2 u k 1 -k 2 can remain invariant in the operations of this group.</p><p>Here are the reflections that we have found :</p><p>Table I : k = ±2k 1 or k = ±2k 2 5+2δ 1-2δ 1 8300 c/mn 5-2δ 1+2δ 1 5016 5+2δ 1 1-2δ 750 5-2δ 1-2δ 1 75 5 1+2δ 1-2δ 540 5 1-2δ 1+2δ 50 6+2δ 2δ -2 40 6 2δ -2-2δ 20 6+2δ 0 -2-2δ 16 6-2δ 0 -2-2δ 0 6+2δ 2-2δ -2 7900 6-2δ 2-2δ -2 500 6+2δ 2 -2-2δ 1080 6 2+2δ -2+2δ 1300 Table II : k = ±(k 1 +k 2 ) 4 1+2δ 1+2δ 200 c/min 4 1+2δ 1-2δ 10 4+2δ 2δ 1 10 4+2δ 1 2δ 20 4+2δ 1 -2δ 60 5+2δ 1+2δ 0 0 5+2δ 1-2δ 0 150 5+2δ 0 1-2δ 10 5-2δ 1+2δ 0 55 5 2δ -2+2δ 75 5 2δ -2-2δ 150 5 2δ -2δ 530 5 -2δ 2δ 620 5 2δ 2δ 300 5 -2δ -2δ 235 6 1+2δ -1+2δ 770 Table III : k = ±(k 1 -k 2 ) 4 1 0 0 c/min 4 1 1 0 5 0 0 0 5 1 0 0 5 0 1 245 ± 10 5 0 -2 0 6 1 -1 0 6 2 -1 0</p></div>		</body>
