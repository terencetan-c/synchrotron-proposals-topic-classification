				<title level="a" type="main">Here is a cumaltive report from several sessions at ID23--1, ID30 1. Crystal structures of nanobody 85--Vietnam 026 P domain complex Dataset for a single crystal of nanobody 85 bound to Vietnam 026 P domain was processed at 2.1Å resolution with completeness 94.8%, space group P 1 21 1. Data proccesing was done with XDS. Molecular replacement was performed using apo structure of Vietnam 026 P domain and structure of nanobody with higest aminoacid homology ( Protein Data Bank code 3P0G ). Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.21 and 0.26, respectively, and well--defined electron density for a vietnam P domain dimer with 2 bound nanobodies. The binding site is located at the bottom part of P domain. Further refinement to reduce R--factors is in progress. 2. Crystal structures of nanobody 27--Vietnam 026 P domain complex Dataset for a single crystal of nanobody 27 bound to Vietnam 026 P domain was processed at 2.7Å resolution with completeness 99.7%, space group P 6 2 2. Data proccesing was done with XDS. Molecular replacement was performed using apo structure of Vietnam 026 P domain and structure of nanobody previously solved in our laboratory (nanobody 25). Refinement led to well--defined electron density for a Vietnam P domain dimer with 2 bound nanobodies. The binding site is located at the bottom part of P domain. Further refinement to reduce R--factors is in progress. 3. Crystal structures of nanobody 13--Vietnam 026 P domain complex Dataset for a single crystal of nanobody13 in complex with Vietnam 026 P domain was processed at 2.7Å resolution with completeness 95.5%, space group P 6 2 2. Data proccesing was done with XDS. Molecular replacement is currently in progress, as models apo structure of Vietnam 026 P domain and structure nanobody 25 were taken. 4. 026 P domain -NIH clinical collection drugs Dataset for a single crystal of 026 P domain cocrystallized with 10 drugs from NIH clinical collection mixed with compound 78 was processed at 1.52Å resolution by EDNA. The Fo--Fc map for some parts of compound78 was observed after molecular replacement. Datasets for 026 P domain cocrystallized with 21 more drug batches were collected with average resolution of 1.7 Å and currently are beeing processed. 5. Crystal structure of norovirus UNSW Polymerase Dataset for a single crystal of norovirus polymerase from UNSW strain was processed at 1.6Å resolution and space group C 1 2 1. Data proccesing was done with XDS. Molecular replacement was performed using structure of Norwalk Virus polymerase (Protein Data Bank code 3BSO). Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.23 and 0.27, respectively, and well--defined electron density for 2 Mg ions in active site. Further refinement to reduce R--factors is in progress. Several dataset for polymerse cocrystalized with RNA primer and DNTP were collected and processed, but no electron density for ligands was found</title>
