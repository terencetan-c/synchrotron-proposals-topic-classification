<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The photocatalytic water splitting by iron carbonyl catalysts using an iridium photosensitizer has been studied by higher energy resolution XANES (HERFD-XANES), K 1,3 -and K 2,5 -X-ray emission spectroscopy in order to gain insights into the the elctronic structure formed in course of the reaction. A picture of the experiment utilizing an artificial sun that illuminates the reaction mixture in a seperate reaction vessel is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The reaction mixture containing the long-lived iron species is then pumped by a pulse-free gear-wheel pump through the reaction cell, where the spectra are recorded. Fe 3 (CO) 12 was used as precatalyst, it was studied in pure THF (1), in the reaction mixture consisting of THF/water/triethylamine (2), with an activating phosphine ligand PR 3 (3) and under reaction conditions. Since an intermediate of the form [HFe 3 CO 11 ] -is suspected to be formed during the reaction , it was synthesized and also measured in THF (4) and the reaction mixture after illumination (5). The corresponding HERFD-XANES and K 2,5 -XES spectra are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>The LUMO (Lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) structure of Fe 3 (CO) 12 ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is slightly altered in the reaction mixture (2), since the prepeak structure, which reflects transitions to the LUMOs changes . This changes proceed with the addition of the phosphine ligand (3). Although the spectrum of the possible intermediate [HFe 3 CO 11 ] -in THF ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is very similar to that of Fe 3 (CO) 12 in the reaction mixture (2), it changes drastically in the reaction mixture under illumination (5). This gives a hint that [HFe 3 CO 11 ] -is in fact the reaction product of Fe 3 (CO) 12 in the reaction mixture. Additionally, the K 2,5 -XES show also changes, however, these are no so obvious as in the HERFD-XANES spectra. The regions were most obvious changes occur are highlighted with arrows in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. What is most interesting are the energy shift between the spectra, although they are not very large. These will the chance to achieve information on the formal current of the formed complexes, whcih are of urgent interest. All these reference measurements as well as a similar set for [Fe(CO)3NO] -as precatalyst are currently analyzed by TD-DFT calculations. Since the measurements were carried out in june 2012, these calculations could not be finished yet. However the results are promising, and currently two publiactions are in preparation using the results of this beamtime. In addition to the reference measurements, which are also  used to "calibrate" theoretical approaches, in-operando studiesin course of the reaction were carried out. These are summarized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> for the reaction catalyzed by Fe 3 (CO) 12 for the first hour of the reaction. As can be seen, only small changes occur during that time, indicating the catalytic resting state is formed rather fast. Nonetheless, the prepeakdecrease and white line increase are currently analyzed to draw more detailed conlcusion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): *Matthias Bauer, FB Chemie, TU Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schrödinger-Str. 54, 67663 Kaiserslautern *Roland Schoch, FB Chemie, TU Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schrödinger-Str. 54, 67663 Kaiserslautern</figDesc></figure>
