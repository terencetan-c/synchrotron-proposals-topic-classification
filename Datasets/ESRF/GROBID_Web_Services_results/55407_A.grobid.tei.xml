<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>NB: Originally, we requested 15 shifts and the comments made by the Review Committee was "Interesting proposal but not enough beamtime available at ID21". Ultimately, the proposal was promoted from the reserve list and we got 6 shifts in August we used to study 4 typical shreds of Qinghua porcelain produced during Ming Dynasty shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Not only the feasibility was validated over concentrated pigment regions, but also significant results were obtained and a paper is in preparation to be sumitted to Analytical Chemistry.</p><p>Full-field recordings were performed on thin cross section samples previously prepared at CEMES. The preparation method was similar to the one used for the study of Roman potteries [F. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Meirer 2013]</ref>. The main steps are summaried in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. After several cutting steps (1-3) in order to obtain two strips with blue decors (4), the strips were glued together glaze against glaze to form a sandwich (5). Subsequently, the sandwich was cut into several ~500 µm slices and then each one was embraced with glue and placed on a glass slide (6). Slices were temporarily mounted on a movable support in brass with a dental wax (7). After polishing the first face, the movable support was heated in order to melt the wax. The sample was flipped and glued with wax. A copper grid (used</p></div>

The slice was polished down to have the same thickness with the copper grid (40-60 µm). Finally, a copper washer (8) was glued to the final thin-section for safeguarding the samples and facilitating their transport (9) and installation on ESRF sample-holder (10). The different thin lamellas obtained from the same sample were noticed with adding -Cn (n lamella number) to the specimen number.</p><p>The first 0.5 shift was used to configurate the beamline in full-field mode at Fe K-edge to Co K-edge. The other 5.5 shifts was used to record full-field XANES stacks. The energy of incident X-ray beam is tuned over the Co K-edge for all four samples (208 different energies, from 7670.2 to 7910.1 eV, with energy steps from 0.3 to 2.2 eV depending on the energy domain) and over the Fe K-edge for two samples (213 different energies, from 7060.0 to 7302.1 eV, with energy steps from 0.3 to 2.2 eV). A 20x optical objective is used to magnify the image onto a CMOS PCO. edge camera, giving a pixel size of 0.32×0.32 µm². After data preprocessing (flat field correction and image alignment), the FF-XANES stack consisting of a series of normalized images was built using PyMca software. Then the data processing (including PCA and k-means clustering) were performed using the freely available software package TXM-Wizard [Y. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Liu 2012]</ref>. In addition, SR-µXRF mappings were carried out using the Scanning X-ray Microscope at ID21 on the same samples thanks to in-house beamtime (not presented here). One of XRF images is shown on the ESRF "beauty of science" page (<ref type="url" target="http://www.esrf.eu/home/news/beauty-of-science/content-news/beauty-">http://www.esrf.eu/home/news/beauty-of-science/content-news/beauty-</ref>of-science/beauty-Qinghua-procelain.html).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Full-field XANES analyses at the Co K-edge</head><p>The results obtained for the MM2-C3 sample are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. The transmission image recorded at 7670 eV, below the Co K-edge, revealed the presence of several large bubbles-Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Main steps of the cross-section preparation: from the fragment sampling (1) to the thin crosssection lamella (9) placed on the specific ID21 sample holder (10). pores (diameter of ~100 µm or smaller) and a multitude of long narrow strips in the pigment zone attributed to anorthite crystals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). The edge jump map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>) shows a distribution of the Co map, which is more concentrated in the pigment zone while quiet limit up to the surface. The edge energy map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>) obtained from pixels with a signal to noise (SNR) level superior to 0.014 shows no significant spectral features variation, with a edge energy at ~7717 keV, consistent with bivalent cobalt [C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Maurizio 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Figueiredo 2012</ref>]. PCA approach and subsequent k-means clustering were processed for a closer inspection. The first three principal components were considered to cover the cardinal significant information, clustered into k = 6 groups. The corresponding XANES spectra can be divided into two groups according their similarities: cluster 1, 2 and 4 and cluster 3 and 6 were grouped as G1 and G2 respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3e</ref>). Cluster 5 was not taken into account due to a low SNR value. With a white line at ~ 7726 eV, the spectra of G1 are congruent with the ones of of aluminate (CoAl 2 O 4 ) particles in which Co 2+ ions are in tetrahedral coordination [C. Maurizio 2010; M. O. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Figueiredo 2012]</ref>. Compared to these spectra, the XANES spectra of G2 exhibit the same pre-edge and the same rising edge, alos indicating a dominat bivalent state for the cobalt ions. However, the energy crests and the white line are clearly different, which the latter is broader and moves to lower energy (~7724 eV). Therefore, from the distributions of the two groups illustrated in the zooming image segmentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3d</ref>), the diffusions of cobalt aluminate particles and bivalent Co in a glassy matrix are presented clearly.</p><p>A second sample of the same specimen (MM2-C1) was analyzed the same way (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The results are similar but the higher Co content outside the particles results in a higher SNR, which allows including increasing pixels numbers in the PCA processing. The differences between the spectral features in the particles and in the glassy matrix are clearer: the cluster 1 and 2 showed the similar traits with group 1 and 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), corresponding to the cobalt aluminate particles and bivalent Co in glassy matrix, respectively. Thus, the distributions of both clusters accurately portray the distributions of particles and Co ions in the glassy matrix.</p><p>MM1-C1, MM1-C2 and MM3-C1 exhibit similar results with high Co concentrated zone corresponding to cobalt aluminate particles (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). In contrast, no based Co particles were detected in MM4-C2 in agreement with SR-XRF investigation (not presented here but ), which revealed a quite homogeneous distribution of Co.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">%5%Results%of%FF</ref>/XANES%analysis%performed%at%the%Co%K/ Edge.% The% transmission% image% was% recorded% at% 7670% eV% from% top% to% bottom% for% MM1/C1,% MM1/C2,% MM3/C1,% as% shown%in%(a),%(c)%and%(d),%respectively.%Image%(b),%(d)%and%(f)% presents% respectively% the% edge% jump% map% of% each% sample.% The% average% XANES% of% each% cluster% was% also% displayed% in% (g).

For MM1-C2, the edge jump map reveals a rather homogeneous distribution around the long narrow strips (anorthite crystals) and the cobalt aluminate particles. There is no variance of the edge energy (~7712.1 eV) and the PCA approach confirms that there is only one type of XANES spectrum. The spectrum is very close to the one of bivalent iron dispersed in a glassy matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[G. Giuli 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">A. J. Berry 2003</ref>]. The Fe-rich thin layer present on the surface of the glaze was not included in the FOV, which was focusing on Co particles. By contrast to MM1-C2, the edge jump map of MM4-C2 indicates a more homogeneous distribution of Fe, consistent with XRF scanning measurements. The PCA approach also revealed only one type of XANES spectra but the edge energy is slightly higher which can be and indicator of the presence of a small amount of trivalent iron. In conclusion, these investigations revealed the micro-composition of the blue decors for the first time. XANES spectra showed that Co is present under two chemical forms: CoAl 2 O 4 in the pigment particles, and Co ions in the glassy matrix. The results show that the oxidation state, chemical environment, concentration and distribution of cobalt-based pigment play a key role in the hue variances of blue decors. The distribution and concentration of Co ions in glaze affect the blue color intensity, with higher concentration and diffusion of Co ions leading to a bluish glaze in some Qinghua porcelains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Photos of the four studied sherds.
