<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>There are many examples in natural and material systems such as protiens and catalysts where several metal atoms of the same identity exist in different chemical environments. The goal of the this experiment was to use the ligand selectivity of valence-to-core (VtC) X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to provide a site selectective probe of geometric strucutre. This was to be achieved by collecting extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra by monitoring the energy resolved fluourescence from iron complexes with the XES instrument at ID26.</p><p>The samples chosen for this expriment were simple Fe complexes and mixtures of these complexes. The complexes chosen for this study were FeO, Fe 2 O 3 , and FeF 3 . Additionally, the following mixtures were prepared: 2FeO:Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 :2FeF 3 , and FeF 3 :FeO. For each of these systems we have collected EXAFS from the Kβ 1,3 , Kβ 2,5 , and Kβʹ′ʹ′ features. energy of 7.8 keV. It can be seen in the spectrum that the there are significant differences in spectra collected at differenent energies. Not all curves mimick the TFY closely. While it is not evident there are differences between the Fe 2 O 3 (red) and FeF 3 (blue) spectra. Each spectrum sits on a significant background from the Kβ 1,3. Data analysis to subtract the Kβ 1,3 collected EXAFS from the VtC EXAFS is ongoing.</p><p>Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> presents EXAFS spectra measured from pure FeO. The first ~300 eV of the EXAFS spectrum is presented for different regions of the Kβ emission spectrum. It can be seen that the TFY spectrum (black curve) is well reproduced by the Fe Kβ mainline (blue curves) detected EXAFS. The spectrum of from the Kβ 2,5 (green curve) feature also resembles the TFY spectrum quite closely, but the spectra from the Kβʹ′ʹ′ (red curves) are quite different from the rest of the spectra. There is a maxima at ~7.16 keV that out of phase with the maxima in the other spectra. This is surprising since the Kβʹ′ʹ′ emission lies between the other emission features that resemble the TFY spectrum. Moreover, we would expect all spectra to be very similar since FeO is a pure substance, and it was expected that XAS spectra sufficiently far above the absorption edge would be the same regardless of choice of detection energy. The difference in the Kβʹ′ʹ′ from the other features was similarly present in Fe 2 O 3 and FeF 3 suggesting that we have identified a fundamental feature of fluourescence detected XAS. Analysis is of this effect is ongoing.</p><p>In summary, we were able to collect EXAFS spectra from Fe Kβ emission features of three chemicals and each mixture of these totalling six systems. Multiple energies were chosen in each case collecting 3 -8 EXAFS spectra for each system from the VtC region. The spectra exhibit differences at different fluourescence energies. Analysis is being performed to establish VtC detected as a viable technique.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Figure 1. Fe Kβ XES of Fe 2 O 3 and FeF 3 .
