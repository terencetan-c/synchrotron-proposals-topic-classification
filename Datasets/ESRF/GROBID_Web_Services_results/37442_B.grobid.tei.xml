<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We report on the investigation of nanostructured silicon using grazing incidence small-angle scattering anddiffraction. For this study, Si samples were irradiated with energetic Xe + -ions in the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf with ion-energies between 5keV and 70keV under oblique incidence, leading to the process of ripple formation at the surface. The ripple patterns have a characteristic wavelength between 45nm and 200nm, depending on ion energy and incidence angle. The projection of the ion-beam on the surface was aligned along <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref>. The ripples align perpendicular to the beam-direction and therefore also perpendicular to the <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref> planes. Due to the damage created by the incident ions, the topmost part of the surface gets amorphous, followed by a transition region towards crystalline material. From TEM measurements it is known that this interface between the amorphous and crystalline part shows the same rippled morphology as the surface.</p><p>In this experiment we investigated the surface morphology using GISAXS and the interface structure and morphology using GID. In addition, the structure of the amorphous layer was studied using amorphous scattering <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The experiments were carried out at the beamline ID01 at a X-ray energy of 8.8keV using a position sensitive detector (PSD) placed perpendicular to the sample surface. The setup allows fast measurements of GISAXS and GID data with intermediate resolution that was sufficient for our purpose. Exemplarily, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows GISAXS and GID (transverse scan) data recorded for a sample irradiated with 50keV Xe + ions. The presence of satellite peaks in the maps indicates the mean wavelength of the probed system, in this case ~190nm. Furthermore, an asymmetric distribution of diffuse scattered intensity indicates a clear asymmetric average shape of individual ripples that can only hardly be determined from AFM measurements due to tip-convolution effects. Furthermore, we found good agreement between GISAXS and GID data, allowing to deduce that both surface and amorphous-crystalline interface show similar morphology also on mm scale, a fact which can not easily be determined from TEM which probes the structures only very local.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows examples of longitudinal GID scans taken either along (a) or across (b) the ripple direction [110] at an incidence angle of 0.1°, limiting the penetration depth to a few nm only. As visible, the measurements show an asymmetric intensity distribution in the scan measured along the ripples, indicating an expansion of the lattice in the transition region toward the bulk material. This expansion may be a consequence of the creation of defects inside the material during irradiation. Surprisingly, there is almost no lattice expansion across the ripples. In addition to samples where the projection of the ion beam was aligned along the [110] direction, we exploratory investigated first samples with azimuthal orientations different from <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref>. In this case, also the (GID-) satellite peaks rotate in reciprocal space and it is no more possible to obtain information from transverse-or longitudinal line scans only. To avoid time-consuming reciprocal space maps, we evaluated a setup using the PSD aligned parallel to the sample surface, i.e. covering a wide range in 2θ. However, for a conventional setup with a relatively broad beam and therefore large footprint on the sample surface, a large area on the sample creates a broad diffracted beam leading to a loss of resolution in reciprocal space (figure 3(a)). To overcome this problem, either an analyser in front of the detector or a small beam size has to be used which lead to significant losses of intensity if a conventional system of slits is used. To increase resolution without loosing too much intensity, we made use of the focussing option at ID01 using a set of compound refactive Be-lenses to focus the beam down to a size of 20×50µm² (figure 3(b)). Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the effect of this setup in reciprocal space, measured at a sample irradiated by 5keV Xe + -ions along <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref> (therefore the satellite peaks are not rotated with respect to the vertical direction). It's visible that the setup with the Be-lenses increases the resolution up to a sufficient level, allowing fast measurements of in-plane reciprocal space maps in further experiments (timescale: 10min for RSM with PSD and Be-lenses; 5h for conventional GID setup using a point-detector).  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 Figure 2</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Reciprocal Space map comparing GISAXS (colour) and GID data (contours).
