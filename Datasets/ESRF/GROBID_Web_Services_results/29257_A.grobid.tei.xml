<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Previous experiments <ref type="bibr">(Corde et al. Cancer Res. 2003)</ref> have shown that synchrotron photoactivation of cis-platinum (PAT-Plat) consists in an excess of DNA single-and doublestrand breaks, probably due to an excess of radiation dose delivered to the close vicinity of DNA. Recently, thank to the efforts of U647 INSERM and the support of ESRF, another publication in Cancer Research has been accepted <ref type="bibr">(Biston et al., Cancer Res, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">, 64, 2317</ref><ref type="bibr">-2323)</ref>.</p><p>As specified in this MD90 proposal, we endeavoured to optimize PAT-Plat by: 1) using new platinum-containing agents to increase the therapeutic index 2) applying this technique to human tumors (nude mice).</p><p>Unfortunately, for technical reasons, the use of human tumor xenografted-mice was not possible since the project of L2 facility, required for such experiments and foreseen some months ago was not still accepted. Consequently, we deliberately focused the beamtime to the first point: to measure the benefit of carboplatinum experiment in in vitro (DNA breaks measurement) and in vivo experiments (survival of rats bearing gliomas)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Sample preparation and irradiations conditions</head><p>For in vitro experiments, equal amounts of F98 rodent cells were submitted to lysis after different treatment to cis-platinum, carboplatinum and/or synchrotron radiation (from 30 to 85 keV) amd thereafter embedded in agarose plugs (neutral matrix). Yields of DNA doublestrand breaks was assessed in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>For survival of rats bearing F98 gliomas, please see previous reports and proposals</head><p>Both in vitro and in vivo set-ups were already developed in routine at ID17 (see previous proposals) and irradiation conditions were applied successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and conclusions</head><p>An extra-number of more slowly repaired DSB was observed when irradiating carboplatinum-treated F98 cells at 78.8 keV but not at 40 keV, confirming the efficiency of PAT with platinum-containing agents. Furthermore, we observed that yields of PAT-Plat induced DSB were proportional to the concentration of platinum atoms, whatever the drugs.</p><p>Conversely, while carboplatinum decreased also the DSB repair rate, cisplatinum appeared to be more efficient to inhibit DSB repair process, at equal concentrations. Again, with carboplatinum the PAT-Plat-induced DSBs provides an abnormally large yield of very short DNA fragments (less than 100 kb), confirming our work hypothesis that PAT-Plat emits electrons at the close vicinity of the cis-platinum DNA-adducts.</p><p>For in vivo preliminary experiments, at the present days, one more month is required to establish clearly the conclusions of the in vivo experiments and to evaluate quantitatively the benefit of the use of carboplatinum. However, we observed that more rats survive with higher concentrations of carboplatinum and that cis-platinum presents the inconvenient to increase the yields of early death (maybe due to higher toxicity than carboplatinum).</p></div>		</body>
