<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Upon weathering, historical glass samples may turn brown-black due to the precipitation of bodies of highly oxidized Mn (Mn4+-Mn6+) within the superficial leached-out glass. Weathering of (historical) glass is a multi-step physico-chemical transformation involving (a) leaching of mobile cations from the glass (replacement by protons), leading to the formation of stacks of μm-thin lamellae of leached-out glass interspersed with voids <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, (a) ≡Si-O-K + H3O+ ↔ ≡Si-O-H + H2O + K + (aq) followed by diffusion of Mn-ions (present as Mn2+ and/or Mn3+ in the original glass [2; 3]) towards the voids and formation of (b) brown-black precipitates, containing more oxidized Mn species, e.g.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) Mn2+ + ½O2 + H2O ↔ MnO2↓ + 2H +</formula><p>This type of alteration is treated by restorers with mildly Mn-reducing agents such as hydroxylamine (NH2OH). Such a treatment can be effectively monitored by means of absorption tomography and Mn-K edge XANES imaging (see report EC602).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 The different steps leading to the formation of Mn-browning and its restoration</head><p>However, also the gradual increase of the leaching damage inflicted by the NH2OH-solution to the healthy parts of the historical glass could be clearly visualized, highlighting the dangers associated with this method of restoration. The aim of the follow-up experiment is to compare the effect of other reducing solutions with that of hydroxylamine in order to optimize the balance between desired and unwanted effects. In the previous experiment we had demonstrated how the Mn contained in the Mn bodies was in an oxidized form (see Report EC602 and reference 4) and how the treatment with NH 2 OH, after an initial reduction of the oxidized Mn, was succesful in solvating the Mn following an exponential decay (see report EC602 and reference 4).</p><p>Experiments EC768 presents a novelty for what concerns the experimental approach, in order to minimize the loss of time for sample mounting/handling and resembling much more the real conservation circumstances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation</head><p>In the current experiment, more treatments were tested (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), and in particular, as said before, a new approach was tried. In EC602 (ID19 part) the treatment was conducted in a discontinued way (several repetition of 30 min treatment in the solution, the measurement done on a "dry" sample between two treatment periods). In EC768 the CT measurement were performed while the glass fragment was treated, kept in a fixed position in a plastic container (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), thus performing "online" or real-time CT. NH 2 OH NH 2 OH + EDTA C 6 H 8 O 7 0.2%; 0.5%; 1%; 1% + KCl, NaCl 1% + KCl, NaCl 1%; 5% Table 1 Tested treatments (% w/w)</p><p>In the part of the experiment done at ID19, we investigated the structural effects of the use of a reducing treatment by visualizing changes in the structure/porosity of the multilayered stacks via high resolution tomography, during the in situ treatment of the same glass fragments (from 0 to 280 minutes). The historical (stained) glass samples that were examined originated from archaeological excavations done at Sidney Sussex College, Cambrige (U.K.). These glass samples date to the 14th century and have suffered corrosion in wet environment (groundwater), for at least 3-4 centuries. Prior to the experiments at ESRF, samples of the same type (prepared in pillar-like shapes suitable for tomography) have been scanned by means of table-top absorption tomography (Skyscan, 3.4 μm resolution) to establish the general shape and position of the corrosion bodies. The resolution available with table-top CT was enough to distinguish the Mn-bodies within the glass, but insufficient for discerning fully the topographic detail. Additionally, an indepth study (SEI, BEI, elemental maps, calculation of Mn-concentrations) of the polished surfaces has been performed with SEM/EDX on the same samples. The calculated composition of the historical fragments is that of a non-durable medieval potash-lime glass (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Moreover, experimental altered glass fragments were prepared by corroding in a controlled environment sensor glass (Fraunhofer M1.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) and immersing it in a 1M solution of MnCl 2 in order to facilitate Mn precipitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2 Composition of the Sidney Sussex College fragments [4]</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The sensor glass did not prove to be a suitable support for CT imaging of Mn-precipitation, at least in its present conditions: the precipitates could only be observed on the immediate surface and no dendrites, as reported in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, were observed. Thus we concentrated on the historical glass.</p><p>The continuous nature of the treatment allowed to performe real time imaging of the Mn-removal, however, a drawback we experienced was the decreased transmission due to the attenuating volume of the solution + holder. The decreased transmission resulted in blurrier images, as can be discerned from the two tomograms from EC602 and EC768 in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. As a consequence of the lower transmission achieved, not all the treatments could be equally evaluated yet, even though in many cases the Mn-removal was visible (Fig 4). The treatment for which the removal was proved were the more concentrated ones, i.e. citric acid 5%, Hydroxylamine 1%, EDTA + Hydroxylamine 1% (additioned of KCl, NaCl), by means of which already a relevant amount of Mn is removed in the first part of the 4 hours of treatment that have been tested (Fig 5). The speed of removal in the small volume marked in Fig 5 is shown by the biplot in Fig 6. The treatment appears to be effective quickly: all the Mn appears to be removed from the selected volume in little more than 2 hours. In Fig 5 it can also be observed how little leaching damage is done to the original glass, thanks to the presence of 5% KCl and NaCl in the treating solution.</p><p>On the other hand, the less concentrated solutions did not prove to be effective, and no or very little Mnremoval could be observed at the end of the 4 hour treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). Fig 6 biplot showing the speed of Mn-removal by NH 2 OH (volume marked in red in Fig 5, deeper in the sample). After 60 min approx. 50% of Mn is removed from the selected volume; after approx. 140 min all Mn is removed. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and future</head><p>Experiment EC768 proved for the first time that it is possible to perform real-time CT on the treated sample while it is immersed in the reducing solution. As mentioned before the evaluation of the results is still ongoing, however we can already list some preliminary conclusions.</p><p>First of all we experienced that a lower concentration of hydroxylamine (1%) than in EC602 is sufficient to remove a great part of the Mn-bodies; lower concentrations (0.5-0.2%) did not work, thus we believe to be close to the critical concentration. Then we proved that citric acid is also successful in extracting Mn from the Mn-bodies, albeit to a lesser extent and at a higher concentration (5%) than hydroxylamine. Finally, the addition of potassium and sodium salts to the treating solution appears to be an effective way to prevent leaching. However, in order to investigate a closer replica of the real conservation conditions, we would need to perform the experiment in a different way, with the treatment supported by methil-cellulose gel, entering the glass from the altered surface only, as it happens in the restoration of large stained glass windows. Moreover, a number of questions have to be completely answered, e.g. what is the minimum treatment time and concentration, or what is the best way to reduce the leaching damage. In order to answer these questions and to test the effectivenesso of the gel-supported conservation treatment, proposal p28872 has been submitted, as a continuation of experiment EC768.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Experimental setup of EC602 and EC768; on the right the sample can be seen immersed in the NH 2 OH solution</figDesc><graphic coords="3,35.50,174.84,371.37,124.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
