<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In August 2009, my colleagues and I submitted a proposal to image the skull of a new hominin recently discovered from the site of Malapa in the Cradle of Humankind. At the time, material from the site was still being analyzed and studied. It was clearly Plio-Pleistocene based on associated fauna, but little else was known of its geochronological age. It was unclear upon initial discovery whether the hominin fossils should be attributed to Australopithecus africanus, Homo (habilis), or whether the material belonged to a new taxon. The primary aim of the experiment was to assess an age-at-death for the individual represented by the partial skull, and to assess its developmental pattern. The secondary aim was to digitally extract the delicate cranium from surrounding matrix and restore it for further study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Current status of the project</head><p>In February 2010, we successfully scanned craniodental material that was attributed to the juvenile male (MH 1). Subsquently, additional material has been recovered and attributed to this individual, while some material previously attributed to this individual is no longer considered to be from MH 1. Results of the imaging conducted at the ESRF led to much better visualization of external and internal anatomy (e.g., the endocast) than results obtained from previous acquisitions using medical computed tomography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Reconstruction of the MH 1 endocast</head><p>After digitally extracting the endocast of MH 1, we conducted a systematic evaluation of its surface morphology and dimensions. Its overall size is more chimpanzee-like, and even small for an australopith, but its surface morphology appears to be more derived (e.g., Homolike) compared to other australopiths that we analyzed. The observed and quantified surface morphology of MH 1, when combined with its small volumetric size, lends support to the idea that neural reorganization occurred prior to neural enlargement in human evolution. The more derived surface topography of MH 1 also supports the notion that A. sediba could be a better candidate ancestor to Homo than A. africanus).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Age-at-death and dental development</head><p>Synchrotron-based imaging of the craniodental remains of MH 1 has provided the initial ageat-death estimate. Preliminary results were presented at a 2014 international conference, and a manuscript is in preparation. The preliminary results suggest that MH 1 was much younger at death than anticipated (&lt; 10 years), particularly when using a human developmental schedule. In fact, the developmental schedule appears to be more chimpanzee-like than human like. Along with other non-adult fossil hominins studied using the protocols developed by Paul Tafforeau and colleagues at the ESRF, it appears that australopith development was much faster overall than appreciated. The pattern exhibited by MH 1, thus characterizing A. sediba, is presently being compared to other australopiths in order to study evolutionary differences in their development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Study of feeding mechanics of A. sediba</head><p>Evidence obtained from MH 1 microwear studies suggests that A. sediba was a hard object feeder. In order to assess this finding using an independent line of evidence, a mechanical analysis of the MH 1 cranium was performed. This study used the partially restored digital MH 1 cranium that was based on segmentation of synchrotron image data. Initial indications are that the MH 1 cranium it is not optimally structured to produce the requisite bite forces that a hard object feeder should exhibit. While A. sediba may have been capable of consuming hard objects, it seems unlikely that this food source would have substantially influenced the craniofacial evolution of this species. This work is currently being written up as a manuscript (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Taxonomic affinities of A. sediba</head><p>Early attempts to use the same partially restored digital MH 1 cranium based on segmenting synchrotron image data have focused on determining whether there would have been substantial morphological change to the late juvenile cranium before the attainment of adult morphology. Using growth trajectories of female and male chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans to simulate remaining craniofacial development of the MH 1 cranium, preliminary indications are that any remaining growth would have minimally altered cranial features. It appears that current morphological affinities of A. sediba based on the juvenile cranium would not have changed even were MH 1 to finish growth and reach adult status. This work is currently being written up as a manuscript (see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Future work plan</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Additional endocast comparisons</head><p>We are continuing to pursue comparisons of the MH 1 endocast with additional australopithecine and Homo endocasts. Of great interest in the next phase of this project will be comparisons with Homo erectus endocasts, and possibly earlier Homo taxa as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Full cranial virtual reconstruction</head><p>We are continuing to segment the synchrotron image data in order to finish extracting the entire MH 1 partial cranium from surrounding matrix. Once this is completed, displacement and any deformation will be corrected, and the virtual cranium will be restored in order to facilitate publishing a final description. Afterwards, a 3D printout will be produced, casted, and distributed world-wide amongst colleagues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Additional comparisons of hominin feeding mechanics</head><p>Inclusion of the current digitally restored MH 1 cranium in comprehensive studies of hominin craniofacial structure, and its function during feeding behavior, continues. The team of researchers conducting these studies uses finite element modelling in order to study craniofacial design and particularly its structural capability of resisting forces generated by feeding on hypothesized dietary items. This gives insight into hominin craniofacial evolution. Additional comparisons with other hominin specimens, and other hominin taxa, are planned.  </p></div>

	<note>The endocast of MH 1, Australopithecus sediba transition from Australopithecus to Homo, but given the small volume of the MH1 endocast, they are not consistent with gradual brain enlargement before the transition</note>
	<note type="raw_reference">Carlson, K.J., Stout, D., Jashashvili, T., de Ruiter, D.J., Tafforeau, P., Carlson, K., Berger, L.R. (2011) The endocast of MH 1, Australopithecus sediba. Science 333: 1402- 1407. The virtual endocast of MH1 (Australopithecus sediba), obtained from high-quality synchrotron scanning, reveals generally australopith-like convolutional patterns on the frontal lobes but also some foreshadowing of features of the human frontal lobes, such as posterior repositioning of the olfactory bulbs. Principal component analysis of orbitofrontal dimensions on australopith endocasts (MH1, Sts 5, and Sts 60) indicates that among these, MH1 orbitofrontal shape and organization align most closely with human endocasts. These results are consistent with gradual neural reorganization of the orbitofrontal region in the transition from Australopithecus to Homo, but given the small volume of the MH1 endocast, they are not consistent with gradual brain enlargement before the transition.</note>
