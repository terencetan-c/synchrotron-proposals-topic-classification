<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RF3:</head><p>We have studied crystals of RF3 from the mesophilic bacterium Bacteroides (Dichelobacter) nodosus in complex with GDP. The crystals are tiny, approximately 0.1 x 0.05 x 0.05 mm and we have so far been unable to improve their size The crystals diffract very weakly to 3.5 A at beamline I711 of the MAX-lab synchrotron and gave reasonable data to 3.0Å at beamline ID29 during this experiment. The space group is apparently P2 1 2 1 2. The cell dimensions are a = 55.7 Å, b = 66.1 Å, c = 153.7 Å, giving a solvent content of 48% and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystalos were transported in the crystallization drops, but did not appear to have travelled well. We screened a large number of native crystals but obtained only one dataset, which proved very challenging to process. We then attempted to solve the structure using molecular replacement. However the best available model is elongation factor G from Thermus thermophilus, which is only 24% identical to B. nodosus RF3 along the whole 531-amino acid length of the latter. If one limits the alignment to the three GTPase domains (I/G, II and III, around 400 amino acids) thought to be common between the two enzymes, the identity is still only 29%, which is on the borderline for MR given the known flexibility of translational GTPases. None of our attempts to solve the structure using this model have so far been successful, even using state-of-the-art programs such as Phaser.</p><p>SeMet protein has been crystallized as for the native enzyme. We attempted data collection at ID29 but the non-frozen crystals did not appear to have travelled well. An edge scan revealed that they contained Se but they did not diffract beyond 8Å. We have improved crystal quality for the SeMet protein and in future will also "pre-freeze" a number of crystals, characterize them if possible at MAX-lab and send the best ones by courier. In view of the problems encountered with molecular</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other projects for which data was collected during this experiment:</head><p>Elongation factor G mutant T84A in complex with GDPCP: We have recently solved the structure of this mutant of elongation factor G (EF-G) in complex with GDPNP, which has revealed for the first time a GTP-like conformation of EF-G. However a peptide bond in the GTPase P-loop was seen to flip in order to hydrogen-bond to the imido nitrogen atom of GDPNP. This has not been observed in other translational GTPases. Thus in order to obtain additional independent information we collected data to 2.9 Å on crystals of the same mutant soaked with GDPCP, where this bond cannot be formed. The crystal structure revealed the same features as the GDPNP structure but without the peptide flip, as expected <ref type="bibr">(Hansson, Singh, Gudkov, Liljas &amp; Logan, FEBS Letters, in press)</ref> Class II, coenzyme B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase: two datasets to around 2.0 Å resolution were collected on crystals which had been soaked for short times with adenosylcobalamin in order to study the cofactor/enzyme complex and the mechanism for C-Co bond cleavage. Previous experiments with longer soaking times had resulted in cleavage of the C-Co bond before or during data collection. However no adenosylcobalamin was found in the active sites, showing that the soaking time was too short.</p><p>Class III, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase: a dataset was collected to 3.1 Å resolution on the R291A mutant in order to study the possible mechanistic roles of completely conserved residues in the active site. The data were 96.1% complete with R merge 7.2%. The structure showed significant movement in a loop containing an essential radical cysteine, demonstrating that Arg291 is important for pinning down this loop in the active site. A manuscript containing these data is in preparation.</p><p>TnBgl3B: We collected a preliminary native dataset to 2.6 Å resolution from crystals of this βglucosidase from Thermotoga neapolitana. One of the main reasons for determining this structure is to provide a structural basis for engineering the enzyme for better synthesis of alkylglucosides. Crystals are small and despite extensive effort the size cannot be improved. They belong to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with cell dimensions a = 67.5 b = 106.2 c =175.5, giving a solvent content of 57.8% and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data are 94.2% complete with R merge =10.1%. However experimental phase information is essential for this project, as there are only two other crystal structures available of members of the glycosyl hydrolase 3 family, and these have only 17% and 19% sequence identity in 400 of the 720 total amino acids constituting TnBgl3B.</p><p>An autoimmune antibody in complex with a collagen type II peptide: This antibody leads to collagen-induced arthritis in mice. We collected one dataset to 2.0 Å resolution in space group P2 1 . R merge was 13.7% and the data were 99% complete with an average I/s(I) = 7.8. The structure has been solved and refined.</p></div>		</body>
