<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the experiment we performed on 11/04/2012, we collected several diffraction data sets from cristals obtained by a DNA dodecamer (CGCGAATTCGCG) with different calix[n]pyrrole units used as ligands.</p><p>From the three dimentional structures obtained, unfortunately for us, was evident that no calixpyrrole unit was ligated in the DNA cristals. This could be mainly due to a very poor solubility in water of the calix[n]pyrrole compounds. During these last months we work hard to obtain some calix[n]pyrrole compounds with an higher solubility in water and we also have indications that a longer incubation time (between DNA and calixpirrole derivatives) will be necessary before to set up the crystallization experiment. Moreover, new crystallization conditions will be used. Now, therefore, we are ready to ask for a new, and hopefully illuminating, shift at the ESRF.</p></div>			</div>
