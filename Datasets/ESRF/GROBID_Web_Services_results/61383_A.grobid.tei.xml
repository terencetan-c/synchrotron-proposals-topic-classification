<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As an example, the results obtained for a solution of 500 ppm [Cu(II)Cl3][C32H68P] in [C32H68P][Cl] are given. Two new peaks appear in the UV/VIS spectrum at 295 nm and 420 nm when [Cu(II)Cl3] is irradiated with X-rays with an energy just above the Cu-edge (9000 eV) (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). As a comparison, we have also measured Cu(I)Cl2 dissolved in 12 M HCl. The spectrum is also shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and proofs that the decomposition product after radiation is Cu(I)Cl2. Cu(II) is thus reduced by X-rays to Cu(I). In fact, the whole spectrum of Cu(II)Cl2 is shifted 28 nm to lower wavelengths because of the different solvent (ionic liquid versus water). We have manually shifted the spectrum 28 nm for a good comparison with the date obtained for the ionic liquid phase [C32H68P][Cl].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Background corrected UV/VIS spectra of 500 ppm [Cu(II)Cl3][C32H68P] in [C32H68P][Cl as function of the X-ray radiation time (9000 eV).</head><p>The peak intensity at 296 and 421 nm have been plotted againt time in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The peak intensities do not further increase after 9 minutes. Both peaks proof that all Cu(II)Cl3 is reduced and transformed into Cu(I)Cl2 after about 9 minutes of radiation. This is a very important finding and shows that care should be taken with analysing this kind of samples with all kind of different techniques using X-rays. Within the next months, the data will be processed with care. Questions and difficulties that might appear are (1) a proper background substraction because some of the copper species (e.g. CuCl4, CuBr4) are giving also signals in the UV/VIS region and their intensities decrease while the intensity of the decomposition product Cu(I)Cl2 increases. Probably, we have to do some lineair combination analysis on the data. (2) How to compare X-ray fluxes and intensties at different energies and (3) how to deal with path length effects (e.g. Cu</p><p>present at the beginning of the X-ray path length through the sample will suffer from more X-ray than Cu at the end of the sample path).</p><p>In addition to the combined UV/VIS EXAFS set up, we have measured EXAFS function of different elements extracted to [C32H68P]2[SO4] (In, REs, Fe, Y). The data are of good quality and will be published soon. A remarkable finding is that Fe(III) for instance is present as a dimer or oligomeric structure in the ionic liquid [C32H68P]2[SO4] (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) The data were Fourier transformed between k = 2.5 and 13.86 Å without window function and fitted to the model between R = 0 and 3.41 Å -1 . 0 1 2 3 4 5 Fe-Fe Fe-S bi Fe-S mono Magnitude FT R + (Å) data model Fe-O Figure 4: Fourier-transform of the Fe(III) sulfate complex in the ionic liquid phase for extraction of Fe(III)</p><p>with Cyphos SO4 from a 1 M Fe2(SO4)3 solution.
