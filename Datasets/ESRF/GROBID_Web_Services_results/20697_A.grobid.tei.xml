<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) study was carried out at the XMaS beamline in July 2001 by the University of Leicester in collaboration with the University of Liverpool. The samples consisted of silver nanoparticles (~2.0nm in diameter) in toluene. The aim of this beamtime was to initially study the aggregation of the particles in solution when subjected to an organic 'linker' molecule. In these measurements mercaptobenzoic acid was used to drive the process. Having determined the basic parameters of the particles, including the average size and distriubution, the same particles were then coated with dodecanethiol molecules that self-assemble on the silver surface. As a solution containing these clusters evaporates, the organic cage mediates a self-organising process whereby the clusters form close packed, ordered arrangements. All results were obtained by solvent evaporation on an oxidised silicon (111) sample.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the small angle x-ray scattering curves (SAXS) measurments, from the solution of silver particles with different amounts of added mercaptobenzoic acid. For the curve with no added linker, the shape is determined entirely by the particle size and distribution. This curve can be modelled using Guinier and Porod methods, where the rate of fall-off is dependent on the size of the scattering object. These analyses indicate that the size of the silver particles used throughout this experiment are in the range of 1.4-1.6nm. As the Counts Scattering angle (degrees)</p><p>mercaptobenzoic acid is added, the clusters start to aggregate together forming a scattering object of interacting particles. This causes a distinct peak to appear at a scattering angle of ~1.67°, that can be interpreted as the separation of the particles in a distorted close packed structure. This yields a separation of approximately 6.7nm using Hosemann's cubic paracrystal model. These results are consistent for the interaction being driven by the mercaptobenzoic acid.</p><p>A solution of dodecanethiol was added to the naked 1.5nm silver particles, so that the quality of ordering by evaporating onto a substrate could be monitored. Previous measurements (see report 28-01-68) had indicated some temperature dependence for the ordering, whereby improved stacking perpendicular to the surface was achieved as the temperature of the substrate was reduced. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the scattering in the out-of-plane direction (vertical scattering) and the in-plane direction (horizontal scattering) for the solution deposited onto the sample held at 9.4°C. This temperature was well below that required for achieving the phase transition in the previously measured gold particles. Peaks were observed at approximately 2.8°in both directions, although the background differs due to the additional scattering from the sample in the out-of-plane direction. Using the same paracrystal model as before, this corresponds to a separation of ~4nm between scattering objects. Given the size of the particles and the length of the dodecanethiol molecules, this indicates only a small amount of interdigitation between the molecules. Additional peaks were observed in the small angle region only for thick films of the silver particles deposited onto cooled substrates.</p><p>Extended measurements of a thick film of the dodecanethiol capped silver particles were made, to cover both the small angle and the wide angle scattering (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The wide angle features were interpreted using the Debye-Scherrer formula to determine the broadening of the peak, due to the crystal size. This gave a value of 5.5nm again indicating a lack of longrange order in the assembly process.</p><p>Other measurements (not shown) recorded as a function of sample temperature and concentration of solution did not show the same phase behaviour as previously observed for gold particles of size 2.5-4.5nm. This is believed to be due to the high polydispersity and small size of the silver particles used in these measurements in comparison to the gold particles that had undergone extensive size selection processes. Any deviation from a monodisperse arrangements of particles is predicted to have a serious effect on the ability of the clusters to form long-range close packed nanocrystals. Future measurements will focus on the effects of different particle parameters on the self-organisation process. Specifically, this will include the cluster size and monodispersity, the ligand chain length and the concentration of particles. For each of these, correlations will be made with the external parameters that may affect the assembly, including sample temperature, sample orientation and surface preparation and the solvent in which the particles are dispersed.
