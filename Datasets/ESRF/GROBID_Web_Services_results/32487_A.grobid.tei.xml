<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In December 2005 we carried out experiments for the in situ interrogation of particle formation in a RESS jet. At the ESRF beamline ID02, nine shifts of beamtime were granted from 02.-05.12.2005 for proposal ME1177. Aim of this measurement campaign was to determine the radial and axial particle evolution in the RESS process jet <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. A previous measurement campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> showed the feasibility of resolving particle sizes in such a dilute system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental setup</head><p>A schematic representation of the setup is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. CO 2 is pumped from a solvent reservoir bottle (60 bar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> with a diaphragm metering pump (3) via a heat exchanger (2) (set at 5°C, to ensure that CO2 remains liquid), a buffer volume(3a) and the radiation lock (baffle, 4) into the thermostatic extraction unit (high-pressure cell (5), V=500ml, with extractor insert (6)) and hence pressurised up to 20MPa. This part of the setup is placed inside the hutch whereas the CO 2 bottle, the heat exchanger, the pump and the buffer is located outside the hutch. The supercritical solvent is loaded with the solute in the thermostatic extraction unit. A burst disk (7) is installed for security reasons. It opens, if the pressure in the extractor/high pressure vessel exceeds 25MPa. The pressure cylinder and adjacent components are designed for pressures up to 35MPa. Thereafter, either pure CO 2 flows through the bypass section of the extraction unit or through the extractor (6) and then the capillary nozzle (50µm(10)). Gas and particles are collected via a hose and filter mounted above the nozzle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment Procedure</head><p>The extractor (6) is filled with a mixture of the substance to be micronized and glass beads. It is then inserted into the pressure vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. The extractor/high pressure vessel is assembled again and all connectors are checked for tightness. This step however has to take place only every few experiment runs, since the extractor contains several grams of substance allowing for some hours of experiment time. The pump is switched on and the pump speed regulated until a pressure of about 20MPa is reached in the pressure vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. While the pump is running, the bypass section is opened enabling a steady flow of pure CO 2 through the nozzle (10). The temperature of the pressure vessel is set to the desired value. When all parameters (p,T) have reached the set value, the valve (8) is slowly opened while valve (9) is closed at the same time. CO 2 flows now through the extractor, loaded with the substances to be investigated. When the whole setup is working at constant parameters, the hutch will be closed and the beam shutters opened. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>The mobile RESS setup</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the nozzle front end mounted on the positioning stage in the experiment hutch. Radial and axial scans of the jet were performed with three different solutes (Phytosterol, benzoic acid, Cu(TMHD) 2 ) and as well with pure CO 2 , using the pinhole setup of the high brilliance beamline ID02. The alignement of the nozzle with respect to the x-ray beam is checked before every new experiment and after every manipulation or maintenance at the nozzle front end. Background measurements were performed before the</p><p>TIC 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 10 PIC TIC TIC TIC 3a</p><p>jet is switched on, or in some cases, just after the experiment runs. Once the jet is running, all vertical and horizontal scans are performed, Experiments with salycic acid were aborted due to problems with the dust collection and venting. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarises the experiment conditions during this campaign. Compared to our first measurements in 2004, we did not encounter the total clogging of the nozzle. This was mainly due to our improved experiment setup, providing stable flow conditions in the jet. From the experiment results however it can be seen, that a partial clogging can occur and causes a slight asymmetry of the jet. The reason for this is most likely an instationarity in the nozzle temperature or the temperature of the heated ducting connecting the extractor with the nozzle, leading to a premature condensation of the solute.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For the measurement evaluation, the antimasked background intensity scattering curves (no jet) were subtracted from those with jet. The averaged background intensity scattering curve during radial scans was steady, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The dependence from the radial position can be neglected. Hence one averaged background intensity curve was used for all radial measurement in one plane. The integration time for each measurement was one second. The measurements in the jet show a clear distinction in the scattering profile as a function of the radial and axial position. Due to the improved setup, we were able to conduct measurements on the jet, which were stable in time compared to the previous campaign (ME-864) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows some exemplary measurements for CO 2 and Phytosterol. The measurements per scan are fairly reproducible and allow for a clear distinction of the measurement position for a radial distance from the centerline up to 1mm. For most scans, at least 5 measurements per position were performed to gain statistical data.</p><p>0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 I(q) (m -1 ) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.1 2 3 4 5 6</p><p>q (nm -1 )</p><p>Radial scan of a pure CO2 jet 0.3mm above the nozzle, from -2mm to 2mm</p><p>r_umme1177_0_554, x=-2mm r_umme1177_0_555, x=-1.5mm r_umme1177_0_556, x=-1mm r_umme1177_0_557, x=-0.5mm r_umme1177_0_558, x=0mm r_umme1177_0_559, x=0mm r_umme1177_0_560, x=0.5mm r_umme1177_0_561,x=1mm r_umme1177_0_562, x=1.5mm r_umme1177_0_563, x=2mm averaged background A 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 I(q) (m -1 ) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.1 2 3 4 5 6 q (nm -1 ) Radial scan of Phytosterol jet 0.3mm above the nozzle, from -2mm to 2mm r_umme1177_0_3728, x=-2mm r_umme1177_0_3729, x=-1.5mm r_umme1177_0_3730, x=-1mm r_umme1177_0_3731, x=-0.5mm r_umme1177_0_3732, x=0mm r_umme1177_0_3733, x=0mm r_umme1177_0_3734, x=0.5mm r_umme1177_0_3735, x=1mm r_umme1177_0_3736, x=1.5mm r_umme1177_0_3737, x=2mm Averaged background B Figure 4 Horizontal scan of a pure CO 2 (A) and a CO 2 Phytosterol jet (B) 0.3mm above the nozzle Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows a contour plot of a pure CO 2 jet (no solute) with droplet radii obtained from the scattering curves by applying the unified fit function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> to the available scattering data between 0.02 and 0.6nm -1 . The actual radius is related to the obtained radius of gyration R g by R=1.3 R g assuming spherical geometry. It is visible how CO 2 droplets grow rapidly by condensation after the Mach Disk (discontinuity in pressure), which is approximately located at 0.5mm, and evaporate again after reaching a maximum size approximately 1-1.3mm after the nozzle exit. The quality of the fit was satisfying, as can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, where the radial scattering curves at two different axial levels, together with the fit, are shown. A reliable fit beyond 1mm radial distance from the centerline of the jet can not be made, since the intensity curve is very noisy after subtracting the background signal, or is even not distinguishable from the latter. It should be mentioned that the interpretation of the results rely solely on the q-range accessible with the pinhole setup 0.3 0.8 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 I(q) (m -1 ) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.1 2 3 4 5 q (nm -1 ) x=0mm x=0.5mm x=1mm x=-0.5mm fit x=0mm fit x=1mm fit x=0.5mm fitx=-0.5mm Horizontal scan pure CO2 jet z = 0.8mm 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 I(q) (m -1 ) 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.1 2 3 4 5 6 q (nm -1 ) x=0mm x=0.5mm x=1mm x=-0.5mm fit x=0mm fitx=0.5mm fit x=-0.5mm fitx=1mm Horizontal scan pure CO2 jet z=1.3mm Figure 6 Background corrected and averaged intensity scattering curves for a pure CO 2 jet at two different axial positions. The dotted lines represent the unified fit function for spherical particles</p><p>For the measurement with particles in the jet however, the approach using the unified fit function did not yield satisfying results yet. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows an attempt of a fit for Phytosterol. The fit deviates in the high q (&gt;0.3nm -1 ) region significantly from the Porod law (~q -4 ), especially in the central part of the jet where high gas and particle concentrations are to be expected. The outer regions of the jet show again a satisfying fit. The evaluation process is ongoing at this moment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The measurement time granted to our team allowed us for the first time to scan the RESS jet, enabling us to resolve the particle size distribution in the jet. These data are needed to improve the modelling of the jet and hence the possibility of process optimisation with regard to particle size and distribution. Particle sizes can be resolved in this dilute system as a function of radial and axial position. Data for a pure CO 2 jet indicate droplet radii from approx. 30 to 155nm in the first 10mm of the jet with a size maximum at about 1.3mm</p><p>The jet was mostly stable in time. However, the measured scattering intensity varied from one substance to the other, and showing as well lower signal intensity for a jet with particles compared to a pure CO 2 jet, taking into account similar or even higher beam fluxes and similar attenuator settings for the experiments with particles. This may lead to the conclusion, that the condensation process of CO 2 during the rapid expansion can not be regarded independent from the particle nucleation, as it was assumed in the theoretical description of the RESS process so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The intention to subtract the scattering intensities from a pure CO 2 jet from those of a RESS jet with particels has to be reconsidered. Further data analysis will include the evaluation of polydispersity. The results of a complete data evaluation of all substances will be submitted for publication once the evaluation process is finished. However, the available q-range from 0.02nm -1 to 0.6nm -1 does not cover the bigger aggregates and particles, which are being generated in the jet. Hence, the information obtained from this q-range about particle size and shape distribution in the jet is lacking data about formation of higher aggregates. USAXS measurements would extend the view as well on aggregates and their fractal dimension and hence complete the picture on the nucleation and aggregation process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 The heated nozzle mounted on the positionig table in front of the SAXS pinhole camera setup.
