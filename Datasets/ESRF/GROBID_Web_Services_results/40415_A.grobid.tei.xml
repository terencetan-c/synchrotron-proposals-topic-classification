<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The reciprocity principle, which states that the interchange of source and detector does not change the scattering amplitude, cannot be derived from first principles and, therefore, is not necessarily fulfilled. The physical term `reciprocity' has been first mentioned by Stokes (1849) and numerous related publications cover the whole 20th century, as it is summarized in the review paper of Potton <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In our recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> a general reciprocity theorem was formulated, which covers all cases of wave phenomena that can be represented by a Schrödinger equation.</p><p>The present study reports on an experimental investigation of reciprocity and its violation. Our aim was twofold: to demonstrate that reciprocity violation can be a remarkably strong effect, and to control easily whether reciprocity violation is present or missing.</p><p>The experimental method was nuclear resonant forward scattering (NRFS) of synchrotron radiation using two experimental arrangements of ferromagnetic scatterers. Both scatterers consist of two foils, each one being a 6 µm thick 57 Fe absorber uniformly magnetized in a field of 0.19 T of permanent magnets. The layers L 1 , L 2 and L 3 are respectively magnetized into directions given by the polar angles (90°,0°), (90°,45°) and (135°,0°), where the coordinate system is chosen with z axis being parallel to the beam and y axis being parallel to the direction of the σ-polarization. The first scatterer S 1 was a combination of an L 1 layer and of an L 3 one, while the second scatterer S 2 was formed by an L 2 foil and an L 3 one. For each scatterer, the scattering spectrum was compared to that of the reciprocal scattering. The interchange of source and detector position was realized by a 180° rotation of the whole sample holder around the x axis of the coordinate system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The four time spectra (count vs. time diagrams) shown in Figs. 1a-1b, 2a-2b were measured at the Nuclear Resonance side station ID22N using a Si(840) channel cut σ-analyzer.</p><p>The experimental results and the corresponding computer simulations made by our computer program <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are both shown in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The slight imperfection in the agreement between measurement and simulation is due to, and informs about, nonperfect uniformness in the foil thickness and the magnetic field inside. The experiment kept these undesired influences under control by using the high collimation and brilliance of the synchrotron beam which allows the usage of slits of as low as 0.5 mm of width selecting adequate homogeneous parts of both foils being 40 cm far from each others. The small size of the slits ensures that, after the 180° rotation of the sample holder, the same part of the foils is illuminated. The agreement of the experimental spectrum with that of the magnitude reciprocal counterpart setting-seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>-justifies the confidence that the recipocal situation was achieved to a high accuracy. We can see that the scatterer S 1 results in reciprocity in the measured intensities, while scatterer S 2 exhibits apparent nonreciprocity. The latter outcome is remarkable because of the large nonreciprocal effect: The ratio of intensities of direct and reciprocal scattering is almost 10 3 in certain time intervals ( The ratio is found to be near the constant 1, which is the value when the intensities exhibit reciprocity. Slight deviations of the ratio from 1 can be seen in the regions of the minima of the beatings, where the count rates are low and statistical errors are significant. In summary, we have realized a (magnitude) reciprocal and a nonreciprocal experimental arrangement of magnetized α-57 Fe foils, which had neither time reversal invariance nor 180°-rotational symmetry. Using nuclear resonant scattering of synchrotron radiation, depending on the easily adjustable experimental geometry, reciprocity, and also three orders of magnitude large nonreciprocity, was experimentally observed in the intensities, in full agreement with the theoretical expectations. The presence of magnetooptic Faraday effect does not automatically lead to nonreciprocity. Further applications in the field of γoptics are expected, as nonreciprocal devices belong to an important class of optical components.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FigFig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
