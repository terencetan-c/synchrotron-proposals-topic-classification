<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Solution structures of the SCR domains in complement factor H and related proteins Abstract: The Tyr402His polymorphism of complement factor H (FH) with 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). How FH contributes to disease pathology is not clear. Both FH and high concentrations of zinc are found in drusen deposits, the key feature of AMD. Heterozygous FH is inhibited by zinc which causes FH to aggregate. Here, zinc binding to homozygous FH was studied. By analytical ultracentrifugation, large amounts of oligomers were observed with both the native Tyr402 and the AMD-risk His402 homozygous allotypes of FH and both the recombinant SCR-6/8 allotypes with Tyr/His402. X-ray scattering also showed that both FH and SCR-6/8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>allotypes strongly aggregated at &gt; 10 µM zinc. The SCR-1/5 and SCR-16/20 fragments were less likely to bind zinc. These observations were supported by bioinformatics predictions. Starting from known zincbinding sites in crystal structures, 202 putative partial surface zinc binding sites were predicted in FH, most of which were in SCR-6. Metal site prediction web servers also suggested that SCR-6 and other domains bind zinc. Predicted SCR-6/8 dimer structures showed that zinc binding sites could be formed at the protein-protein interface that would lead to daisy-chained oligomers. It was concluded that zinc binds weakly to FH at multiple surface locations, most probably within the functionally-important SCR-6/8 domains, and this explains why zinc inhibits FH activity. Given the high pathophysiological levels of bioavailable zinc present in subretinal deposits, we discuss how zinc binding to FH may contribute to deposit formation and inflammation associated with AMD.</p><p>Publication: Khan, S., Rodriguez, E., Patel, R., Gor, J., Mulloy, B. &amp; Perkins, S.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>The highly sulphated polysaccharides heparin and heparan sulphate (HS) play key roles in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Despite its importance, no molecular structures of free HS have been reported up to now. By combining analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle X-ray scattering and constrained scattering modelling recently used for heparin, we have analysed the solution structures for eight purified HS fragments dp6 to dp18 and dp24 corresponding to the GlcA-GlcNAc domains of heparan sulphate. Unlike heparin, the sedimentation coefficient s 20,w of HS dp6-dp24 showed a small rotor speed dependence, where s 20,w values of 0.82 to 1.26 S (absorbance optics) and 1.05 to 1.34 S (interference optics) were determined. The corresponding X-ray scattering measurements of HS dp6-dp24 gave radii of gyration R G values from 1.03 nm to 2.82 nm, cross-sectional radii of gyration R XS values from 0.31 nm to 0.65 nm, and maximum lengths L from 3.0 nm to 10.0 nm. These data showed that HS has a longer and more bent structure than heparin. Constrained scattering modelling starting from 5,000-8000 conformationallyrandomised HS structures gave best fit dp6-dp16 molecular structures that were longer and more bent than their equivalents in heparin. No fits were obtained for HS dp18 or dp24, indicating their higher flexibility.</p><p>We conclude that HS displays an extended bent conformation that is significantly distinct from that for heparin. The difference is attributed to the different predominant monosaccharide sequence and reduced sulphation of HS, indicating that HS may interact differently with proteins compared to heparin.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Nan, R., Farabella, I., Schumacher, F., Miller, A., Gor, J., Martin, A.C.R., Jones, D.T., Lengyel, I. &amp; Perkins, S.
