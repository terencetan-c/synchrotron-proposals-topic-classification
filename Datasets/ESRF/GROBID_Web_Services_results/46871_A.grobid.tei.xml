If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. The goal of our experiment was 3D microstructure mapping of a series of austenitic-ferritic duplex steel samples by means of phase contrast tomography (PCT) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT). The duplex steels are widely used for high-loaded components in off-shore technologies. The 3D microstructure mapping is required for understanding of damage mechanisms in the Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF) regime. The experiment was the first collaboration between two interdisciplinary working research teams (German DFG project 3D-VHCF: 1 post doc and 2 PhD students, and the French ANR project 'Crystal' which has been granted a 3 year post-doctoral fellowship at the ESRF).We have investigated a series of samples consisting of 6 mini-specimen, which where prior to the experiment pre-fatigued to different but very high numbers of loading cycles (R=-1). (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>

Stress-amplitude and number of cycles of the examined fatigued specimen.</p><p>For this study at the ID11 we used the standard PCT/DCT tomography set-ups (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>,3). As detector we used a FReLoN charge coupled device camera (2048 x 2048 pixels) equipped with an optic set and a GdGa-garnet scintillator giving an effective pixel size of 1.5 µm.  The samples axis were put in the center of rotation using a goniometer head. The X-ray energy was 40 keV and 7200 images were recorded during a 360° rotation of the sample. Using a Si (111) double crystal monochromator the acquision time was two hours for PCT and seven hours for DCT. The grain map was later reconstructed using an existing code written in MATLAB. Currently, the code is optimized for single-phase materials such as Ti alloys and therefore, not directly suitable for the two phase duplex steels. In present DCT experiment problems arose due to a strong texture effect so that sometime different diffraction spots were overlapping on the detector screen. Both effects seriously complicates the reconstruction scheme. Currently, an optimization work of the code is under way which will enable a much more precise phase reconstruction. However, a first PCT and DCT renditions of the 3D grain structure are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>   After the optimization of the code, complete 3D-reconstructions of all six samples will be performed. The 3D orientation data will serve as input for (i) the verification of the finite element approach to predict the sites of first local plasticity under very high cycle fatigue loading conditions (macroscopically elastic), (ii) the development of a new model concept for the formation of pronounced slip bands as a consequence of partially irreversible dislocation motion on distinct slip systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Konstantin Istomin (University of Siegen, Physics Department)* Alexander Giertler (Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences)* Ulrich Krupp (Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences) Ullrich Pietsch (University of Siegen, Physics Department) Report:</figDesc></figure>
