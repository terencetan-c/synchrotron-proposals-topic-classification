<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was about the XRF analysis, in very high resolution, of isolated coccoliths of minute dimensions (from 2 to 10 µm, depending on the species). Some of the coccoliths were actual, coming from cultures performed by our working group <ref type="bibr">(Faucher et al., 2017)</ref>, other were taken from geological samples of early Cretaceous age. Coccoliths are produced by phytoplanktonic algae called coccolithophores and are made of calcite. The main objective of our analyses was to map the concentration and distribution of trace elements (Sr and lighter elements) in coccoliths cultured in normal VS stress conditions (high CO2 and metal concentrations) as well as in fossil coccoliths from geological intervals favorable for calcification VS intervals of extreme paleoenvironmental conditions.</p><p>The experiment was very successful as we managed to analyze a relatively large number of samples with a resolution of 50 x 50 nm, and a few larger ones with a resolution of 100 x 100 nm for a total of 20 specimens analyzed. This allowed to compare the results between specimens collected from the same culture conditions thus providing a more solid interpretation of the outcomes. The results obtained are stunning.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a high-resolution image at 50 nm resolution of a Coccolithus pelagicus (extant species of about 8 µm). The red colour represents Ca concentration, while the yellow one represents Sr concentration. The figure shows some areas where both elements are present (though in different concentration) and areas where only one of two is present. Sr can enter calcite structure, so it's very likely distributed almost everywhere in the sample.</p><p>Other elements, such as Cl, for instance, are present in the culture (as the coccolithophores which produced the coccoliths to form their shell, live in seawater), but do not usually enter the calcite structure. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the concentration distribution of Cl and Ca in another C. pelagicus specimen. As it can be clearly seen in the figure, Cl is distributed over the whole sample, but it's more concentrated in certain areas, where Ca decreases. The experiment was challenging, particularly for what concerns the sample preparation. Such small samples are difficult to isolate, extremely difficult to handle and to deposit on the sample grid. We used a TEM sample holder, with a Cu grid with grid elements. This was a winning choice for what refers to finding the specimens which were easily detected with the usual methods suggested by the beamline scientists. However, the presence of copper was inadequate, as its signal tended to mask the signal coming from the sample. For the next experiment, we plan to use a different sample holder.</p><p>The results of experiment ES841have been submitted to Scientific Reports (Bottini C., Dapiaggi M., Erba E., Faucher G., Rotiroti N. "High resolution spatial analyses of trace elements in coccoliths reveal new insights into element incorporation in coccolithophore calcite" under review, SREP-19-41998-T), the abstract of the paper is as follows:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Coccolithophores are phytoplanktonic algae which produce an exoskeleton made of single platelets of calcite named coccoliths. They are widespread in all oceans and directly impact the long-term C cycle. The study of coccolith size, morphology and composition reveals important information regarding the ability of the cell to calcify and on the factors that alter this process. In this regard, very little is known about coccolith elemental composition and if this changes under altered environmental conditions. Here, we present high resolution (50x50 nm) elemental spatial distribution in pristine coccoliths of Coccolithus pelagicus and Gephyrocapsa oceanica reconstructed via X-ray fluorescence analyses at synchrotron. The studied specimens are from control culture and metal-enriched (V, Ni, Zn and Pb) experiments. The specimens produced under stress conditions display an irregular shape and are thinner, especially in the margin, being marked by a reduction of 1/3 in the total amount of Ca. The same specimens also have higher Sr/Ca ratio with highest values in the coccolith margin, suggesting that difficulty in calcification is additionally reflected in altered Sr partitioning. Two elements, As and Se, are found in the coccolith calcite suggestive of other cations incorporation in the calcite following the Ca pathways.</p><p>Coccoliths are not the detoxing reservoirs of the metals added in higher concentrations. V and Pb apparently did not interact with the coccolith but Zn and Ni were deposited on the coccolith surface. &gt;&gt;</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Cinzia Bottini, Università di Milano, Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra* Monica Dapiaggi, Università di Milano, Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra* Nicola Rotiroti, Università di Milano, Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra*</figDesc></figure>
