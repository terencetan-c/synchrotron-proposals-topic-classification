Box 5000 Upton, NY 11973-5000 Report: Sample Measurement CaC 6 Ca K edge YbC 6 Yb L 2 edge Yb L 3 edge EuC 6 Eu L 2 edge Eu L 3 edge Table 1: A summary of measurements performed in this experiment. CaC 6 and YbC 6 were mounted in normal incidence. EuC 6 was canted to ensure sensitivity of the absorption crosssection to the in-plane moment.</p><p>The discovery of superconductivity in CaC 6 and YbC 6 , at temperatures below 11.5 K and 6.5 K respectively, has initiated a resurgence of interest in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Advances in intercalation chemistry have allowed synthesis of bulk samples, facilitating deeper exploration into the physics of the superconducting state. Additionally, europium based GICs are of interest on account of their frustrated magnetic behaviour. At low temperatures EuC 6 exhibits ferrimagnetism when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the graphene sheets. The underlying mechanism is thought to be an RKKY interaction between the Eu 2+ moments mediated via π-band electrons. The instrumentation on ID12 permits extensive coverage of the phase diagram and enables shell specific detection of the local europium moment. We report here the first measurements of XANES (x-ray absorption near-edge spectra) and XMCD (x-ray magnetic circular dichroism) from the superconductors CaC 6 and YbC 6 and the magnetic donor GIC EuC 6 . A summary of the measurements is given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The polarization of the incident photons was manipulated using a HELIOS-II undulator. A magnetic field was applied using a 6 Tesla superconducting cryomagnet. The signal was detected in the fluorescence channel. XMCD spectra were obtained through reversing the field direction and the photon helicity.</p><p>The samples were prepared at University College London using vapour transport techniques (YbC 6 and EuC 6 ) and a molten alloy method (CaC 6 ). The samples were characterised using inhouse XRD and sealed and transported under argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation.</p><p>We initially investigated the absorption spectra from EuC 6 at the Eu L 2 and L 3 edges. To ensure that the absorption coefficient was sensitive to the in-plane magnetism the sample was canted with respect to the incident beam. A measurable XMCD signal was detected at the L 2 and L 3 edges (the L 2 edge is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The XMCD signal is given by Δµ(E)=(µ + -µ -) and the XANES by (µ + + µ -)/2 where µ + and µ - are the x-ray absorption coefficients measured with positive and negative photon helicities respectively. The presence of an XMCD signal demonstrates a non-zero polarization of the Eu 5d shell. This polarization may be attributed to an exchange interaction between the 5d shell and the magnetic 4f electrons.</p><p>The post-edge shoulder, approximately 8 eV above the main peak, is associated with the minority Eu 3+ state, most probably due to a surface oxide layer of Eu 2 O 3 . The dominance of the divalent state from the data is consistent with Mössbauer and paramagnetic susceptibilty measurements.</p><p>Difficulties arise with the standard sum rule analysis due to the spin dependence of the transition matrix elements. This means that the XMCD is no longer proportional to the difference in the spin dependent density of states. This hinders a deconstruction of the total magnetic moment into spin and orbital components. Soft x-ray absorption measurements at the Eu M edges are being considered as these constitute a direct probe of the europium 4f magnetic moments.</p><p>7600 7620 7640 7660 Energy (eV) XANES -Normalized XMCD (a.u) fluorescence (a.u) -0.08 -0.04 0 0 1.0 2.0 3.0</p><p>We also report XANES and XMCD measurements at the calcium K-edge of the superconductor CaC 6 . Hints from SQUID magnetometry data motivated us to probe the calcium K shell to search for signs of interplay between superconductivity and magnetism within this compound. We find that the XMCD from this compound is negligible. The situation was very similar in the analagous layered superconductor YbC 6 . The XANES and XMCD for this material were measured at the L 2 and L 3 edges. No detectable dichroism was found implying no net polarization of the Yb 5d shell.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: An XAS study of the graphite intercalation compounds, XC 6 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba, Yb) and XLD, XMCD measurements in the superconducting state of CaC 6Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
