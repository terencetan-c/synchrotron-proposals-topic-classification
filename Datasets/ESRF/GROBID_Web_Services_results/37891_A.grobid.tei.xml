<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This campaign has suffered from a significant instability of the beam supplied (~40% beam time loss due to low intensity and no refilling during 6 shifts due to booster failure). As a consequence, only a small part of the scheduled experiments have been performed: the annealing at 200 and 300ºC for 2 Ni-Ti alloys: a Ni-rich (alloy "N") and a Ti-rich (alloy "H") that have been subject to severe plastic deformation by cold-rolling to 40% thickness reduction. It was intended to complement these studies with the following information (not possible during MA-419):</p><p>-the effect of deformation heterogeneity (in depth) by analysing the surface of a sample extracted from mid-thickness of the rolled material; -the effect of annealing temperature of 350ºC (only 200 and 300 have been studied previously) -the transformation temperature (As) from martensite (B19') to austenite (B2) is shifted above 200ºC (compared with the As close to 100ºC of this alloy); this transformation seems to take place without intermediate phase (R-phase) formation; -during the thermal cycle between room temperature and -100ºC (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 -b</ref>) for the determination of the transformation characteristics of the annealed material, the transformation from B2 to B19' (cooling) and B19´to B2 (heating) is taking place in one single step, without the formation of the Rphase.</p><p>The results obtained with Ni-rich alloy (N) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. It may be noticed that:</p><p>-the as deformed material (at room temperature) contains stress induced martensite; -during the first heating cycle, the transformation temperature (As) from martensite (B19') to austenite (B2) is shifted above 250ºC, so that after annealing at 200ºC still some martensite remains; only after annealing at 300ºC the martensite diffraction peaks fully disappear; -during the thermal cycle between room temperature and -100ºC (Fig. <ref type="figure">1 -b</ref>) for the determination of the transformation characteristics of the annealed material, the transformation from B2 to B19' (cooling) and B19´to B2 (heating) seems to take place in one single step, without the formation of the R-phase. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig.1: In situ XRD of Ti-rich NiTi alloy initially cold-rolled (up to 38% thickness reduction): (a) structural evolution during annealing up to 200ºC, cooling to -100ºC, heating to +80ºC; (b) structural evolution during annealing up to 300ºC, cooling to -115ºC, heating to +80ºC. The results obtained with Ti-rich alloy (H) are shown in Fig. 1. It may be noticed that: -during the first heating cycle -annealing up to 200ºC, Fig. 1 (a); annealing up to 300ºC, Fig. 1 (b)</figDesc></figure>
