<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of this proposal was to use X-ray Excited Optical Luminescence (XEOL)-detected XAFS to investigate the structure, environment and electronic properties of a series of novel highly luminescent oligoatomic lead and silver lithium /sulphur clusters confined in LTA zeolites as a function of the hydration state and metal and/or lithium loading. These clusters possessing very specific optical properties are generally formed during the controlled heat treatment under O2/He gas flow of Ag/Li/Na/S and Pb exchanged LTA zeolites. Depending on the Li loading and the heat treatment temperature novel luminescent low Ag loading exchanged lithium-sodium-LTA zeolites can show emission from the green to the red. Heat-treated Pb-Na-LTA is a novel type of LTA zeolites containing lead clusters. These materials display a deep-blue emission with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) strongly depending on the lead content. Their emission colour and EQEs also show a strong dependence with respect to their hydration state. Finally, novel mixed AgS clusters in LTA zeolites present a remarkable white emission.</p><p>For this experiment we have recorded XAFS of various series of LTA zeolites at Ag K-edge (25514 eV) in XEOL-detection mode using a fast photomultiplier tube coupled to the sample via a condensing lens and an optic fiber available at BM08 and simultaneously in transmission mode. AgLiNa clusters within LTA zeolites corresponding to the formula Ag1(LixNa12-x)[Si12Al12O48] were first investigated. A total of four Ag1LiNa-LTA samples corresponding to Na pure (Ag1Na12-LTA); intermediate lithium loading (Ag1Li4Na8-LTA) and full lithium loading (Ag1Li12-LTA) have been measured in pellets in their hydrated forms. High lithium loading dehydrated samples (Ag1Li12-LTA), (Ag1Li10Na2-LTA) and (Ag1Li11Na1-LTA) were measured in capillaries at LN temperature using the cryostat available at BM08. Dehydrated samples showed a marked loss of the luminescence upon beam exposure suggesting a structural transformation of the clusters during the measurements Two AgS-LTA samples were additionally measured in this beamtime. They also presented a marked degradation of their emissive properties during measurements.</p><p>Six Pb-exchanged LTA-zeolite (PbxNa12-x)[Si12Al12O48] samples with different Pb loadings were also successfully measured at Pb L3-edge (13035 eV). Low lead loading (Pb0.5Na11.5-LTA) and intermediate lead loading (Pb4Na8-LTA) samples dehydrated at 200 and 450 °C were successfully measured in capillaries while their hydrated forms were measured in pellets. A marked degradation of intermediate dehydrated samples was observed.</p><p>A total of 8 scans were generally collected for each sample to ensure a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. Although the useful k range of the collected EXAFS is limited to kmax = 8 Å -1 preliminary EXAFS analysis showed that the quality of the XEOL-detected data is likely sufficient to determine the structure of the luminescent clusters</p><p>The EXAFS data is curently being analysed. This investigation is expected to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the photo-luminescence properties and the structure, electronic properties and local environment of these Ag/Li, AgS and Pb clusters as a function of the metal content and the heat treatment temperature and contribute to designing novel materials with optimized tailored properties.</p></div>		</body>
