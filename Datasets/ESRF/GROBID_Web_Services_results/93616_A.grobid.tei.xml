<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Experimental setup</head><p>The ultimate aim of the experiment is to characterize the microstructure of a superelastic NiTi as it evolves due to martensitic transformation and coupled plastic deformation processes induced by tensile loading. For this purpose an in-situ 3DXRD experiment using a scanning pencil beam of ~200 nm was tailored and realized in configuration shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. A 30 μm superelastic wire heat treated so to obtain rather large grains of ~5 μm, as checked by EBSD measurement <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1b)</ref>, was used in order to limit the number of grains within the scanned gauge volume thus facilitating the 3DXRD post-processing. Furthermore, a ~5 μm wide Pt layer was deposited over the wire's circumference serving as a marker (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) in order to track the same gauge volume of the sample throughout all deformation stages probed during the experiment. In total 7 deformation stages, including the referential stress-free virgin stage, were probed as indicated by filled red circles I-VII in Tensile stress-El. Resistivity-Tensile strain graph (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) recorded during the experiment. All the expected deformation processes are well indirectly detected by the evolution of the electrical resistivity that was also measured during the experiment (blue curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) The deformation stages were selected to characterize expected deformation mechanisms consisting of the elastically strained austenite structure at the edge of martensitic transformation (II), stress-induced martensitic structure (III), martensitic structure deformed at two different extends via deformation twinning and dislocation slip (IV, V), plastically deformed subgraines of martensite structure retained after unloading (VI), plastically deformed subgrains of austenite structure reversed by stress-free heating (VII). At each stage, the same region of interest (ROI) was scanned in y direction along the wire cross-section using the y-step of 0.3 μm and in omega range of 180 deg. using the step of 0.1 deg. The ROI was centred around the wire axis as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> thus representing an inner cylindrical core of the wire with diameter of 20 μm and height of ~15 μm .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data post-processing</head><p>Using the selected pencil beam scanning diffraction setup (68x48x1000 scans per scanning stage) a large data set was recorded (18.2 TB in total). The data set was largely reduced down to 242 GB by data segmentation as individual diffraction frames were sparse due to low number of grains illuminated. A script for parallelized peak search and storage into column files was implemented using ImageD11 package. In addition, sklearn package was used to implement peaks clustering in order to reduce duplicated peaks in omega scans.</p><p>A script for parallelized reconstruction of grain cross-sections and strain fitting was implemented based on grain indexing by ImageD11 applied to peaks collected from all y-omega scans at a single z position, inverse radon transformation of sinograms constructed for individual indexed grains, and strain fitting by refining unit cell parameters at each point on a sinogram. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> an example of a reconstructed cross-section is shown in terms of grains distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), axial strain component (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>), and axial stress component (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) related to loading stage II, i.e. elastically strained austenite prior the stress-induced martensitic transformation. Further post-processing is being performed in order to reconstruct crystallography, strain, and stress in loading stages III-VII.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. HELLER Ludek*, Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance 2, Prague 18221, Czech Republic Dr. SITTNER Petr*, Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance 2, Prague 18221, Czech Republic KADERAVEK Lukas, Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance 2, Prague 18221, Czech Republic</figDesc></figure>
