<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Sorption, coprecipitation or formation of solid solutions are likely to be the dominant mechanisms of metal uptake by iron oxides. The retention of radionuclides, U(VI) among them, by these Fe(III) solids are of high interest for the safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal, due to the massive occurrence of iron compounds in the repository as one of the main steel corrosion products or due to its widespread presence among the surrounding materials. In order to evaluate the importance of these processes in the sequestration or mobilization of radionuclides, it is necessary to understand how uranium is bound to the iron solids and how ageing time does influence the retention and the rearrangement processes of the precipitates. The objective of this work is therefore to investigate the main evolving processes with ageing time of synthetic coprecipitated samples of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and U(VI), using XAS analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Fe(III)-U(VI) coprecipitates were prepared from Fe(III) nitrate and U(VI) nitrate solutions. Initial concentrations were [Fe]≈0.01 M and [U(VI)]≈10 -4 M at pH≈5.5, that is, initial uranium concentrations were below theoretical schoepite solubility limit. The samples were aged in solution for periods between 1 day and 5 weeks. The solids were afterwards collected and let to age in dry state (for periods between some days to 11 years) before the analysis. All the process (preparation, wet aging and dry aging) were carried out at room temperature. The analysis of the solutions indicated that the uranium content in the coprecipitates was ≈1-2%. Uranium EXAFS analyses were performed using the U L III -edge in the Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL, BM20) at ESRF. Spectra were collected in fluorescence mode at room temperature. EXAFS scans were collected, pre-treated and averaged using Sixpack <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Webb, 2005)</ref>. Data analyses were performed using the WinXAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ressler, 1998)</ref> software. Theoretical scattering amplitudes for each absorber and backscattered pair were calculated with the FEFF 8.20 code <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Rehr and Albers, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>EXAFS analyses using the U L III -edge signal for samples aged from 1 day to 11 years are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Some differences are observed in the spectra as the ageing time of the coprecipitates increases, suggesting that the uranium environment might change with time. The uranium EXAFS spectrum of the coprecipitates shows several coordination shells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): -The most intense feature in the spectrum corresponds to the two axial oxygen atoms of the uranyl group.</p><p>-The second coordination shell corresponds to the uranium interaction with oxygen atoms in the equatorial plane.</p><p>-The third coordination shell also seems to correspond to the uranium interaction with an oxygen in the equatorial plane (Oeq2). The distance between uranium and this atom seems to progressively decrease with the ageing time of the co-precipitate sample.</p><p>-Preliminary fittings also indicate that the U-Fe coordination number decreases with time.</p><p>-U-U interaction is difficult to appreciate due to noisy background and the long interaction distances between those atoms.</p><p>Those measurements are consistent with a re-arranging of the uranium content towards a schoepite-like structure. This hypothesis is in agreement with preliminary data obtained with other spectroscopic techniques (X-ray diffraction, μ-XRD and iron EXAFS analyses), which also point out to an evolution of the coprecipitates with the ageing process. Further data analyses and fitting of the U-L III EXFAS spectra are still on-going.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Results of the EXAFS U L III -edge measurements for U(VI)/Fe(III) coprecipitates at different ageing times. Solid black lines are experimental data.
