<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this study we have recorded both WAXS et SAXS patterns during uni-axial deformation of Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and Polyethylene (PE) using the Princeton CCD camera available on the BM02 beamline and a stretching device designed so as to be adapted on this beamline. In this report we will describe the results obtained, on the one hand for the deformation of the PLA samples on a large temperature range and on the other hand for PE with different molecular architectures when stretched at room temperature.</p><p>Regarding to the PLA, the resin used in this study has a 4.3% D-isomer content and the samples were stretched at ε° = 0.01s -1 in the temperature range 25°C-75°C. Both amorphous and semi-crystalline films (χ c = 5% &amp; 28%) were studied in order to characterize the influence of crystallinity on the structure evolution. Drawing experiments in the range 45°C-65°C, i.e. up to or near the glass transition temperature Tg, have allowed us to give evidence that whatever the crystallinity a mesomorphic phase, i.e. a phase with an intermediate order between amorphous and crystalline phases, is induced upon stretching, as it has never been reported before. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates a typical WAXS pattern and the associated intensity profile of the mesomorphic phase. The mesophase content was calculated as a function of deformation. A direct correlation was established between the development of the mesophase and the strain hardening phenomenon occuring at high strain levels. On the other hand the results obtained for the stretching at Td = 75°C have shown that the observed strain hardening phenomenon results from an actual strain-induced crystallization phenomenon.</p><p>Examination of the integrated intensity profiles obtained at Td = 75°C revealed that the structure of the induced crystalline phase differs from the structure of the thermally cristalline phase as can be seen on Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The "strain-induced crystal" consists in a slightly distorded form of the "thermal crystal". The observed differences can be ascribed to the D-isomer content of our material. Indeed during thermal crystallization the D-isomer units can be easily excluded from the cristal lattice contrary to stretching that compells to incorporate the crystal lattice. Another issue of those experiments was to understand the role of the mesophase. In this way we followed the structure evolution of a sample with a significant mesomophase content during relaxation and heating experiments.</p><p>The obtained results strongly suggest that, contrary to the case of PET, the mesophase in PLA does not act as a precursor of crystallization but rather correspond to constrained oriented chains which are unable to crystallize due to lacking mobility. Nevertheless this conclusion has to be confirmed by further investigations. The SAXS experiments carried out on the samples were aimed at characterizing the structure evolution of the material at a mesoscale in combination withWAXS experiments. For samples stretched below the glass transition temperature of the material, SAXS experiments have allowed to follow the evolution of the deformation mechanisms which occur during the deformation. As an example, these experiments revealed that two deformations mechanisms, namely crazing and shear banding, are cooperatively activated as can be seen from the meridian and diagonal scattering respectively in the SAXS pattern from Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. For draw temperatures above Tg, the SAXS experiments carried out on amorphous samples have shown that a long range order builds up fot Td = 75°C, i.e. when strain induced crystallization takes place (Fig 4 <ref type="figure">.a</ref>). However, no long range order could be observed for Td = 65°C, i.e. when a mesomorphic form is induced. Fig 4.b SAXS pattern of a semi-crystalline sample drawn at Td = 75°C at ε = 300% (draw axis is horizontal)</p><p>For initially-crystalline samples, it has been shown that a fibrillation process (Fig 4 <ref type="figure">.b</ref>) occurs beyond a deformation of 133%. This latter phenomenon is of prime importance to account for the variations of the crystallinity during the WAXS experiements. Nevertheless for technical reasons the evolution of the long period during the stretching of initially crystalline samples could not be followed. To sum up, the precise characterization of the structure evolution during these experiments has allowed us to explain the deformation mechanisms of the material, in terms of relaxation time and orientation of the amorphous phase which proved to govern the material behavior. A microscopy study is in progress in order to complete the obtained for the initially semicrystalline samples that display quite complex structure evolution. Concerning the PE, its visco-elastic behaviour is generally attributed to the amorphous lamellae deformation. Stack lamella deformation depends on their orientation with respect to the loading axis. The local deformation is controlled by the dimensions, the intrinsic properties of the amorphous and crystalline lamellae, and the mechanical coupling between both phases. This coupling is ensured by the stress transmitters (ST) such as the tie molecules and entanglements. The influence of the ST density on the spherulite deformation has been investigated. A wide experimental campaign has been undertaken on several polyethylenes with controlled molecular parameters and subjected to different thermal treatments. The ST density has been evaluated experimentally by the natural draw ratio. The local deformation until yielding is analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering along a tensile test thanks to an in situ tensile device specially developed for ESRF.</p><p>The follow-up of the evolution of the stretching of the long period in the tensile direction has allowed calculating the local deformation of the amorphous phase. The difference between local and macroscopic deformation, that transcribes the heterogeneity of the deformation, was found to be well correlated with the ST density (See fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</p><p>The phenomenon of cavitation has also been studied. Several polyethylenes were found to exhibit voiding. The follow-up of the intensity scattered by the voids along the tensile test has allowed analysing the evolution of the cavities (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The analysis of the SAXS patterns has allowed quantifying the size of the cavities and the total volume of the voids. The initiation of voiding and the voiding rate were found to be correlated with the microstructural parameters.  </p></div>
