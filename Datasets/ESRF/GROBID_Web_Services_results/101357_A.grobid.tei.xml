<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>ES-1212 was performed in Nov, 2022. The polycrystalline wadsleyite (Wads) samples with different Fe concentrations (XFe=0, 0.1, 0.2) and one ringwoodite (Rw) sample (Fo90) were successfully pre-synthesized at UCL using multi-anvil press at 14-20 GPa and 1473-1673 K and double polished as the starting materials for the ultrasonic measurements at ESRF. During this beam time, seven multi-anvil runs were conducted using the 10/4 assembly with a newly developed X-ray transparent TiC-MgO composite heater. The composition of samples and the maximum PT conditions for each run are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In each run, we first compressed the sample to the targeted pressure (~10-20 GPa) depending on its composition, and then heated the sample to 800-1000 Â°C to release the stress in the sample during compression. After that, the temperature was decreased and increased in cycles and X-ray diffraction (XRD), imaging and MHz frequency ultrasonic measurements were made during the heating loops to determine the structure, length and acoustic velocities. The temperature was monitored by the thermocouple and pressure was determined using the peaks of NaCl by real-time XRD to make our best not to go out of the Wads stability field. The new diffraction free gaskets were used through the X-ray windows in all experiments. The TiC heater worked well up to the highest temperature (1630 K) in our experiment and the sample was observed to be in the middle of the X-ray window after compression, which enables the measurement of sample length through X-ray imaging. The ultrasonic signal for both P and S wave are quite good for run-2 and run-4 during the whole experiments and were successfully measured up to 15.5 GPa, 1453 K and 20.1 GPa, 1636 K respectively. In run-3, only P wave signal was observed and measured up to 16.4 GPa, 1630 K and we were not able to identify the S wave signal due to the high noise-signal ratio. This poor signal-noise ratio was later found to be due to either (1) the negative thermal expansion of soldering material which partly pulled the transducer off during heating or (2) the poor isolation of the earth wire with the signal wire which are quite close to each other. The XRD pattern were collected at the same time through several heating loops and therefore by refinement and fitting, we can get high pressure high temperature equation of state parameters of the corresponding phases. Compared with the traditional pyrophyllite gasket, the diffraction free amorphous gasket in the X-ray window would increase the chance of blow out, which lead to the failure of run-1, 5 and 6. In run-7, the Fo80 Wads was transformed to olivine upon heating due to it's narrow stability field (&lt; 1 GPa at 1400 K).</p><p>Experiments all produced large volumes of XRD and ultrasonic data (typically ~ 8000 diffraction patterns per experiment). To process such large volume of data, new analyses procedures have been developed. An example of typical ultrasonic spectrum at 19.9 GPa and 1630 K was shown in  Due to complexity of experimental setup, we would like to request more beam time to continue and complete our study in the next step. The goal is to measure both P and S wave of Fo100 Wads simultaneously and measure the Fo90 Wads with thermocouple working to explore the strong dependence of elastic properties on temperatures. The thermocouple works for most of our experiments. For the ultrasonic measurement, we find a way of connecting signal wire and transducer without soldering so the transducer would have less chance to be pulled off. Also, we have learned to isolate the Earth wire and the signal wire very well. Despite the narrow stability field of Fo100 and Fo90 Wads, we were able to keep it in the range where Wads is stable during the heating path and measurement. So we believe that we will find the suitable way to measure the acoustic velocities of Wads at transition zone conditions. If having the chance, we would also try to measure Fo80 Wads which has a larger stability pressure range at higher temperatures (&gt; 1600 K).</p><p>(a) (b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 1 with (a) raw spectrum and (b) the crosscorrelation of P wave signal.</figDesc></figure>
