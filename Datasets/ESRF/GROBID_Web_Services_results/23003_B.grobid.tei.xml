Following up on work from the previous BAG on Hjc, we have obtained crystals of Hje, a second resolvase from S. solfataricus which has homology to Hjc. The structure is of interest has Hje and Hjc have quite different DNA cutting patterns. Restriction enzymes in general utilise differing arrangements of monomers in a dimer to vary the cutting pattern, but sequence analysis suggests that Hjc and Hje should have a conserveddimer interface. Time on EH2 was used to obtain a good quality native dataset prior to the expected (and successful) structure solution on EH4 on the next day 09/05/2002 (see separate report).</p><p>Data: Data to 2.1 A resolution were collected from a crystal of dimensions 0.2x0.2x0.4mm grown at pH 8.0 from a solution containing tris buffer, Li 2 SO 4 PEG 4000 and ethylene glycol. The data were of high quality (Rsym 4.0%) allowing confirmation of the spacegroup as P6 1/5 . This knowledge prepared us fully for the subsequent MAD experiment, but the data has become redundant due to the recent collection of higher resolution data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>* Mutants of Hjc, a Holliday junction resolvase.</head><p>Also following up BAG work, we observed that the same conspicuously exposed Ile residue in Hjc was responsible for crystal contacts in both hexagonal and cubic crystal forms, and that this might explain concentration-dependent inhibition of Hjc's activity and cause its 'hypercrystallisability' (poorly diffracting crystals grow within minutes in over half of the Hampton conditions). We rationally designed a mutant, delta62-63 with the view that this should remove this interface with the minimum structural disturbance. Indeed crystals grow more slowly in a new primitive monoclinic spacegroup which makes screening for protein-DNA complex crystals more straightforward.</p><p>Data: Highly redundant data to 2.2 A resolution were collected on crystals of dimensions 0.1x0.1x0.5mm in spacegroup P2 (1) . This data is not very clean, possibly due to crystal splitting, however judicious data processing followed by molecular replacement (AMORE) using the native Hjc dimer has produced an interpretable map in P2 1 showing disruption of the relevant part of the structure. Refinement/analysis is underway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>* Hjc-DNA cocrystals.</head><p>Numerous crystals of Hjc cocrystallised with double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA or Holliday junction DNA were screened. Two crystals diffracted well enough for full data collection, but both were in previously characterised native Hjc crystal forms (P6122 and I23) and neither contained any DNA. This work is ongoing and use of BAG time for screening the sometimes poorly diffracting crystals is beneficial in leading us towards much desired crystals of a complex.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>a second Holliday junction resolvase from Sulfolobus solfataricus.</figDesc></figure>
