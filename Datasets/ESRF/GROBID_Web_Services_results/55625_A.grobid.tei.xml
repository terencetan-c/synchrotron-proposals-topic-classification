<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED SINCE LAST BIANUAL REVIEW:</head><p>Major contributions from the Bange group include: i) crystal structures of the ATPase FlhG that determines place and number of bacterial flagella <ref type="bibr">(Schuhmacher, PNAS, 2015)</ref>; ii) structure of a t-RNA binding module for the rational design of a new catalyst <ref type="bibr">(Giessen, Ang. Chem. Int. Ed., 2015)</ref>; iii) A ribosomal chaperone that guides ribosomal protein 10 during ribosome assembly <ref type="bibr">(Pausch, Nature Communications, 2015)</ref>; iv) structural determination of catalytic mechanism/allosteric regulation of the central pppGpp synthetase RelP (Steinchen, PNAS, 2015, final revision). Several crystal structures have been determined for flagellar type III secretion (fT3SS)/ biofilm formation (bioF) and bacterial cell division (Div) that are partially submitted to PDB and await publication (e.g., 5DMB, 5DMD). Several structures of fungal effectors (FVF) are finished and await publication. BioSAXS was successfully applied to several projects: In particular, we could structurally determine: i) several complexes involved the post-transcriptional regulation and targeting of Flagellin to the fT3SS (2 manuscripts in prep./submitted); ii) an essential complex for biofilm formation (in prep.).</p><p>Major contributions from the Essen group include the structures of: i) fungal Flo11 adhesin, and flocculin-like adhesins <ref type="bibr">(Kraushaar, Structure, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kock, 2015, submitted)</ref>; ii) an engineered, minimal channel porin (Grosse, Biochemistry, 2014); iii) phytochromes and photoreceptors <ref type="bibr">(Kionetke, 2015, JBC;</ref><ref type="bibr">Banerjee, 2015, in rev.)</ref>. Several more structures await publication (including: animal-like cryptochromes, protein phosphatase PPP5, asymmetric SDH heterotetramer BbsCD). BioSAXS was successfully applied to determine the models of i) ABfR1 and the ABfR1/DNA; ii) the Aureochrome 1a alone and complexed to AUREO-box DNA (2 manuscripts are in prep.).</p><p>Srinivasan could determine structures of the early-acting components of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery that synthesizes a [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein Isu1 (in preparation). These steps critically rely on the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1-Isd11 (as a sulfur donor), the ferredoxin Yah1 (as electron donor for sulfur reduction), and Yfh1 (frataxin) for the sulfur transfer from Nfs1 to Isu1. BioSAXS was successfully applied to structurally determine the entire ISC biosynthetic complex Nfs1-Isd11, Yah1, Yfh1, and Isu1. The data reveal a first 3D picture of the orientation of these components, and, together with comprehensive biochemical studies, allow the proposal of a mechanism of ISC formation on Isu1 (manuscript in prep.). Furthermore, structural analysis of the central ABC-transporter Atm1 in complex with substrate and/or nucleotides was carried on.</p><p>Klebe and coworkers could determine several high-resolution structures of Factor XIII complexed with medically relevant compounds for the development of anti-coagulants (in prep.).</p><p>The Reuter group could collect several datasets for t-RNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) for the development of Shigelliosis inhibitors.</p><p>The Heine group could make significant progress in determining the structure of mQTRT, the non-catalytic subunit of the TGT from mouse, at reasonable resolution (in prep.). Furthermore, they could determine several highresolution datasets of Proteinkinase A complexed with ligands for inhibitor development (in prep.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEAMLINE PERFORMANCE:</head><p>We are very positive about the excellent assistance by the beamline staff that was helpful in the case of difficult data collections and hardware issues. The automatic data processing is a great help.</p><p>Beamline equipment is world class and we always enjoy measuring at the ESRF.</p><p>The recent installation of the MASSIF beamlines is a great advance for high-throughput data collection. We were also impressed that samples that could not be measured during our shifts, were stored and still measured at a later time point. Thank you so much! We will require even more in the near future for the high-throughput structural determination of medically relevant targets.</p><p>Negative: The EHO called to hardware problems during late night spoke only poor-English.</p></div>			</div>
