<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A relatively large number of samples (&gt;20) were made available specifically to conduct this experiment. These samples cover the full extend of meaningful As concentration, ranging from low (1.0 10 17 at/cm 3 ) to highly doped (1.7 10 19 at/cm 3 ) As:HgCdTe. 3 types of sample exist:</p><p>• as-grown samples</p><p>• n-type samples that have undergone a single low-temperature heating (#200°C) to fill out Hg vacancies • p-type samples that have undergone first a high-temperature activation annealing (3h@370°C) under Hg overpressure before a low-temperature heating It is in this latter type of p-type samples that is found the AsHg 8 compact structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements:</head><p>To check the experimental setup, we started by recording a single spectrum on our reference p-type sample (24875_01). XAS spectra was of good quality, EXAFS oscillations were clearly visible until k=9Å -1 . In R-space, the first shell of 8Hg was clearly visible as well as a second shell. It is this second shell we want to clearly identified as constituted of Te. We note the presence of a low-k/low-R contribution probably due to a small oxydation of this sample elaborated 1½ year ago despite it was stored under primary vacuum. Here is the table of all our recorded samples: Name Type Edge Jump (10 -3 ) As content (at/cm 3 ) Comment 24875_01 P 8.44 5 10 17 Plate centre, reference sample **** 26667_03 As-grown 9.38 5.5 10 17 Plate centre, 5 spectra, 26667_02 N 7.61 4.5 10 17 Plate centre, 7 spectra 26667_01 P 7.34 4.5 10 17 Plate centre, 4 spectra **** 26697_01 P &lt;1.10 17 Not enough As **** 26699_03 As-grown 40.78 2.4 10 18 Plate center, 16 spectra 26699_05 16.57 9.7 10 17 Plate corner, 9 spectra 26699_14 18.45 1.1 10 18 Plate corner, 1 spectrum 26699_04 N 32.47 1.9 10 18 Plate center, 11 spectra 26699_01 P 29.41 1.7 10 18 Plate center, 12 spectra 26669_08 13.20 7.8 10 17 Plate corner, 5 spectra **** 26702_01 P 46.08 2.7 10 18 Plate centre, 1 spectrum 26702_08 17.12 1.0 10 18 Plate corner, 1 spectrum **** 26703_02 As-grown 215.8 1.3 10 19 Plate centre, 1 spectrum 26703_04 N 218.6 1.3 10 19 Plate centre, 1 spectrum 26703_01 P 240.1 1.4 10 19</p><p>Plate centre, 1 spectrum 5 plates (ZnCdTe 2" substrate) were specifically realised to conduct our study. In each plate, 16 samples were cut, central samples being numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 where As fluorescence intensity show a good homogeneity. Corner samples are outside the homogeneity zone extend of the plasma source. Samples from plates 26667 and 26699 were ideal for our study: low enough to avoid As clustering and high enough to extend EXAFS oscillations as far as possible. Data reduction was conducted on-site during experiment and sadly, we noticed that all p-type samples were completely oxidised as illustrated on highly-doped plate number 26703: Sample edge shifts by 6eV from metallic edge 11867eV to oxidised arsenic as 11872.9eV, the white line does the same, kχ(k) EXAFS oscillations display a completely decreasing intensity and |χ(R)| shows a single short-distance contribution.</p><p>Several months later, it was shown that the brand new oven that was used for high-temperature annealing had in fact a micro-leak localised near a current feed-through: oxygen was present during annealing thus explaining the fully oxidised p-type samples. Therefore, our experiment could not reach its goal but we nevertheless fully used available beam time to record good quality spectra from our samples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Experiment title :</head><label>title</label><figDesc>Chemical environment of the uncovered AsHg 8 compact structure responsible for the p-type electrical conductivity in As:HgCdTe This experiment was dedicated to the study of the AsHg 8 compact structure (X. Biquard et al., J. Appl. Phys. 106, 103501 (2009)) that was discovered in 2009 with ESRF's experiment MA-442 (sample 24875_01). The 30-elements Canberra detector was used (500ns shaping time), ROI of each detector's element were individually adjusted with minimal width to select only the As fluorescence and avoid as much as possible Hg fluorescence. Monochromator's glitch at 12010eV was systematically removed.</figDesc></figure>
