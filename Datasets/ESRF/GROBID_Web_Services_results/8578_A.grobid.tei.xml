<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Location of the counter-ions in ITdoped conduct&amp;polymers</head><p>Poly(aZkyZthzophene)s ( ( C&amp;S-alkyl), ) are conducting polymers that are resonably well understood in their undoped form. The polymer main chains tend to order parallelly in a lamellar fashion, with the alkyl side chains extending normal to the lamellar planes [ 11.</p><p>For the doped polyalkylthiophenes the situation is different, however. There exists up till now no direct evidence for where and in which form the dopant molecules enter the polymer, but extensive X-ray diffraction studies have been performed on iodine &amp;)-doped poly(hexyl-)-, poly(octyl-)-and poly(dodecyl-)-thiophenes (PHT, POT and PDoDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Although these studies show that the polymer lattices expand upon doping, the dopant ions do not give rise to new reflections, and their location and molecular form in the lattice remain unsettled.</p><p>The present experiments aimed at characterizing the iodine molecular form and environment in doped polyalkylthiophenes using XAS spectroscopy.</p><p>EXAFS spectra of iodine in various forms were recently studied by Buontempo et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The interatomic distance in iodine solutions was observed to depend on the polarity of the solvent, being directly related to the solution colour, in another work by Buontempo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The K-edge is of iodine is at 33.2 keV.</p><p>Various poly(alkylthiophene)s were studied in the present work, with POT studied in most detail. Cast films of thickness 40 -100 urn were doped in iodine vapour at room temperature, and several doped films were put together to give an iodine content of the samples in the range of 20 -40 mg I / cm 2 The iodine content was determined by weighing. To keep the doping level constant the samples were encapsuled in office tapes just m preparation.</p><p>Reference samples of crystalline most used. triiodides were prepared. CsIs, N(Methyl) 4 I 3 and N(Butyl), 1s with the latter the EXAFS absorption spectra were obtained at room temperatutre and at 40 K. For the subtraction of the atomic edge spectrum the data of ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> was used. The low-temperature spectra differed from the RT spectra only by being less damped.</p><p>Results of the preliminary analysis of the POT data are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, which shows the average I-I-distance R as a function of the iodine content in the samples. For some concentrations also a low and a high R-value could be discerned. As is seen the R varies between that of triiodides (2.93 A) and that of solid I z (2.714 A), the former dominating at the lowest concentrations and the latter being asymptotically approached at high concentrations. Assuming that the doping process leads to the formation of I 3 (P + 3/2 12 -P+ + 13-), one may use Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> to calculate the variation of the 1 3 -and the I*-content with the iodine concentration, giving the results of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> is very important and surprising: True doping, i.e. formation of I 3-ions takes place only at iodine content below 0.3 (weight iodine/weight polymer). Further exposure of the polymer to iodine vapour evidently leads only to weight increase due to molecular Iz, which appears to enter the material easily, but which only marginally will influence the electronic and conductive properties of POT This finding in fact corroborates well with X-ray observations: At low iodine uptake the lattice parameters a and b have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to vary linearly with the iodine content, a increasing and b deceasing, but such that an overall lattice expansion takes place. But these effects reverse and an overall moderate lattice contraction sets in as the uptake proceeds beyond 0.3 Our results strongly indicate that the initial lattice changes are directly related to the Is-formation. Further uptake of molecular 12 proceeds to give rise to a moderate lattice contraction. The results also show that the diffraction data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> will have to be reinterpreted. The reasonable assumption was made in that work that all iodine goes into the &amp;-state, but Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the Is-content to saturate at a molar level of only 0.06-0.07 (referred to the monomer of the polymer), so that most of the iodine is in the form of 12 at high doping level. The reason for the lattice contraction is not clear, however, but it is not unreasonable to think in terms of some complexing reaction</p><p>The studies indicate also the presence of interatomic distances about 3 5 A and 5.8 A, which tentatively could be interpreted as an I-S distance (S=sulfur in the thiophene backbone) and a next-nearest-neighbour I-I-distance in a linear Is-ion. Studies performed on PHT, PDoDT and on poly(dioctylbithiophene) (PDOT 2 ) and poly(dioctylterthiopene) (PDOT 3 ) have not yet been analysed quantitatively, but seem to be in gross agreement with those of POT.</p></div>		</body>
