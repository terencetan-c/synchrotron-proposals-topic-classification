<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report :</head><p>Relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by a broad and frequency-dependent maximum of the dielectric permittivity as a function of temperature, instead of the sharp and frequency-independent divergence observed in classical ferroelectrics. They exhibit no long range polarisation but it is generally admitted that their peculiar dielectric behaviour is related to the dynamics of randomly orientated nano-scaled polar regions <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In relaxors with the ABO 3 perovskite structure, these regions arise from short-range correlated displacements of the A and/or B cations within their negatively charged oxygen cages. They are detected well above the temperature of the maximum of the dielectric permittivity (T m ) up to a temperature denoted T Burns . The persistence of cation displacements above T Burns is an open question, related to the debate on the nature (displacive or order-disorder) of phase transitions in classical ferroelelectrics such as BaTiO 3 .</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to study cation displacements in two typical relaxors PbMg 1/3 Nb 2/3 O 3 (PMN) and BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 (BTZ) through XAFS measurements below and above T Burns . Due to the risk of a Pb pollution of the furnace, we decided to focuse on BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 (T Burns = 300 K and T m = 180 K at 1 kHz) and to compare its behaviour with that of BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 measured in the same experimental conditions. BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 has an average cubic perovskite crystallographic structure. EXAFS studies at the Zr K-edge have shown that the Zr atoms are located close to the centre of their oxygen octahedron <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. By contrast, through the analysis of pre-edge features of the XANES spectrum at the Ti K-edge [3], we could establish that the Ti atoms are strongly displaced (by approximately 0.2 Å) in the temperature range <ref type="bibr">[10 K -300 K]</ref>. In order to get information on Ti displacements at higher temperature, we have measured XAFS spectra at the Ti K-edge from room temperature up to 700 °C.</p><p>Experiments have been performed in the transmission mode, using a Si(220) double-crystal monochromator. Pellets were made by mixing the sample powders with a boron nitride powder. The temperature evolution of the pre-edge part of the XANES spectra in BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. A high intensity pre-peak centred at 4970 eV is detected in the whole temperature range.</p><p>4965 4970 4975 4980 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 SrTiO 3 BaTiO 3 T = 300 K Normalized absorption Energy (eV) BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 [111] p × 4965 4970 4975 4980 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 SrTiO 3 BaTiO 3 T = 300 K Normalized absorption Energy (eV) BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 [111] p × [111] p × .</p><p>Neglecting a quadrupolar contribution, this pre-peak results from the p-d hybridization that occurs when Ti atoms are displaced out of their centrosymmetric position. In a first approximation its area is proportional to the mean squared Ti displacement, which includes an eventual static displacement and the effect of atomic vibrations <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>. These two contributions cannot be easily separated. Nevertheless, at all temperatures up to 700 °C, the amplitude of the pre-peak measured in BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 is found to be much larger than that measured in SrTiO 3 and similar to that measured in BaTiO 3 . One example is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Since the only contribution to the pre-peak in the paraelectric SrTiO 3 comes from atomic vibrations, we can conclude qualitatively that appreciable (non vibrational) Ti displacements persist in the BaTi 0.65 Zr 0.35 O 3 relaxor up to 700°C, that is well above T Burns . EXAFS analysis (in progress) is expected to provide additionnal information on the evolution of the Ti-O distance distribution as a function of temperature. However the extraction of EXAFS oscillations is made difficult by the restricted available k-range imposed by the the presence of the Ba LIII-edge at 5245 eV.</p><p>[1] L.E. <ref type="bibr">Cross, Ferroelectrics 76, 241 (1987)</ref>.</p><p>[2] C.
