<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Since we did not receive beamtime in the 16-bunch mode as requested in the proposal, the experiment was not performed as planned. Without measuring the time delay of scattered radiation, information about the pulse propagation velocity was impossible to measure.</p><p>Instead, we decided to measure the dispersion of a nuclear cavity QED system displaying features of electromagnetically induced transparency. We measured the energy spectra of the reflectivity, for a series of angles of grazing incidence around the center of a cavity.</p><p>The measurements were taken with the synchrotron Mössbauer source (SMS) of ID18. By and large, our experiment was successful. There were however some problems and setbacks. For several days, the SMS showed wildly unreliable behaviour. The energetic width of the beam changed regularly. Also, the angle of incidence of the beam coming from the SMS crystal onto the sample drifted and changed, which was highly inconvenient for reflectivity measurements. Furthermore, the measured spectra had a strong sinusoidal modulation which is very likely not due to the sample properties, but to some sort of problem with the SMS. The beamline scientists determined that the problems were largely to blame on the particular crystal in the SMS and exchanged it for another one; this certainly solved the problem of the resolution, which was extremely reliable and good from that point on. The other problems were alleviated enough to continue the experiment, altough they have caused some problems and uncertainties in the process of data analysis. Nevertheless, the data is by and large of good quality. We also used the same sample to perform cavity QED transmission experiments. While taking temporal spectra was not possible as mentioned above, we were able to (a) determine the total transmission of the waveguide, and (b) take energy spectra of the transmitted radiation. It turns out that while the transmission is very low, the contrast in the Mössbauer spectra is very large, such that effects can be observed even with low countrates.</p><p>While we were not able to pursue this in a systematic way, these measurements will certainly be a great help in planning and optimizing future experiments.</p></div>		</body>
