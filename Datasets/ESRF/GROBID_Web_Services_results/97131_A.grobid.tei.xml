<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>On the first active day, an attempt was made to working at 21 keV. However, at this energy, we could not reliably locate the position of the electrodes by means of scattering. Nevertheless, the RSMs were collected. The next day, the energy was dropped to 10 keV, which made it possible to find electrodes, collecting the RSMs. On the night of the same day, we ran into the problem of applying an electric field to the film. After a while, we understood that the needle has deteriorated in conductivity, likely due to the X-ray-aided oxidation. In the end, the needle started to deposit huge amount of dirt onto the electrodes. This dirt is likely non-conductive. Likely, other needle material is needed (likely -wolfram or gold) and perhaps care needs to be paid to avoid the exposure of the needle by the direct beam. The last night we did useful nanoscopy trial: 30-nm beam scanning the 50-nm film. We do not see a huge variation in the superstructure intensity over pix, piy, which we interpret as domains being considerably smaller than the beam size, so many domains are always in the beam and the superstructure intensity does not go to zero upon scanning because a decent amount of the domains with the respective orientational state are always illuminated.</p></div>			</div>
