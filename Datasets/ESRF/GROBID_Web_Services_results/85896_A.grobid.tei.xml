<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed a serial crystallography at ID09B beamline on the dinuclear silver complex [Ag2(4stilbz)4] [CO2CF3]2 (4-stilbz = trans-1-(4-pyridyl)-2-(phenyl)ethylene, Ag2(stilbz)4) to investigate the irreversible photoreaction of the organometallic complex. It was previously reported that the molecule in crystal undergoes [2+2] photodimerization reaction upon photoexcitation (See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In this beamtime, our primary goal was to investigate whether a sufficient fraction of the molecules in the crystal undergoes the reaction even with an excitation using a single laser pulse. In other words, we were to confirm whether the structural change induced by the single laser pulse is large enough to be detected by using serial crystallography. To confirm this, we collected the x-ray diffraction images at two time delays which correspond to before (-3 ns) and after the reaction (100 ps time delay), respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A typical pump-probe scheme using an optical laser pump pulse and an x-ray probe pulse was used to identify the structures of the molecule before and after the photoreaction. A 360 nm pump pulse was generated by using optical parametric amplifier (OPA) on a fundamental pump pulse (800 nm). The laser pulse was converted to the desired wavelength (360 nm) and focused to a spot of 150 µm × 190 µm 2 at the sample position (laser fluence = 1.1 mJ/mm 2 ). After excitation, the reaction was probed by an x-ray pulse (E = 15 keV) with the x-ray energy bandwidth of ~3 %. Single crystals of Ag2(stilbz)4, with the size from 300 to 500 µm, were loaded on fixed target holders and subjected to x-ray pulses to obtain diffraction images from the crystals. To apply a serial experimental scheme, where each fresh crystal is exposed to only a single x-ray pulse and then discarded, the fixed target holder was translated continuously during the measurement. Ten X-ray diffraction images were collected for every second using the Rayonix MX 170-HS CCD.</p><p>Initially, the x-ray diffraction images were collected for the negative time delay, i.e., for the crystal before laser excitation. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, it can be confirmed that a sufficient number of diffraction spots can be captured by using a single x-ray probe pulse. The collected x-ray diffraction images were manually indexed by using Lauetools (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). We also collected the diffraction images for the crystal after the photoexcitation, i.e., at 100 ps time delay.</p><p>In conclusion, we successfully collected sufficient numbers of x-ray diffraction images of Ag2(stilbz)4 for the crystals before and after the photoexcitation. Now we are analyzing the diffraction images to retrieve the exact molecular structures of Ag2(stilbz)4 in the crystal. References [1] Q. Chu et al., Angew. Chem. Int.
