<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Ferromagnetism in GaMnAs is intensively studied because of prospective applications of GaMnAs in spintronics (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, for instance). Ferromagnetism of the Mn spins is mediated by holes in a p-type GaMnAs. On the other hand, Mn atoms in interstitial positions give rise to donor levels in the energy gap and therefore they violate the ferromagnetic ordering and decrease the Curie temperature. Theoretical calculations predicted that a ferromagnetic state of GaMnAs could be achieved at room temperature for lattice-Mn content above 10% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. A growth of a GaMnAs layer having the Mn atoms in lattice positions is extremely difficult because of a very low solubility of Mn. In order to prevent the creation of MnAs precipitates, a molecular-beam epitaxy growth of GaMnAs has to be performed at extremely low temperature (of about 200-250°C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. X-ray diffraction has been used for the determination of the concentrations of Mn lattice and interstitial atoms by measuring lattice misfit or structure factor of GaMnAs. These methods, however, are not reliable, because the dependence of the lattice parameter of GaMnAs on these concentrations is still under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>In our experiment, we have used the x-ray standing wave method (XRSW) to determine the relative concentration of Mn lattice atoms and interstititals. In this method, the x-ray fluorescence MnK stemming from the Mn atoms is measured as a function of the incidence angle of primary radiation.</p><p>We have used the primary radiation with the energy 10 keV, the fluorescence signal was measured by a Roentec detector placed close to the sample surface. We have investigated a series of 4 samples of 100 nm thick GaMnAs layers with nominally 5% Mn deposited at 240°C at GaAs(001). After the growth the samples were annealed at 200°C for 0, 1 2 and 4 hours in the air. The layers were tetragonally distorted, having the same lateral lattice parameter as the GaAs substrate underneath. Due to this fact, the XRSW method was performed in a grazing-incidence (GID) geometry, in which the diffraction vector was parallel to the sample surface; we have used the strong diffractions 400, 220 and the quasi-forbidden diffractions 200 and 420. In each XRSW scan, the intensity of the MnK fluorescence was measured as a function of the azimuthal direction of the primary beam keeping constant the incidence angle α i of the primary radiation. The scans were carried out for various values of α i below and above the critical angle of total external reflection. Examples of experimental results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> along with their theoretical fits.</p><p>In order to analyze the experimental XRSW curves we have simulated the fluorescence yield for several positions of the Mn atoms in the GaAs unit cell as well as for randomly distributed atoms in the cell. This simulation was based on dynamical diffraction theory in GID geometry taking into account the absorption of the fluorescence radiation in GaMnAs. In the simulation we have also assumed a nonhomogeneous distribution of the Mn atoms across the layer thickness, this nonhomogeneity however turned to be very small.</p><p>In a GID geometry, the XRSW signal is sensitive only to the lateral coordinates of the Mn atoms. Therefore, it is principally impossible to distinguish between the Mn atoms in lattice and interstitial positions, since the energetically favorable Mn interstitials (with As atoms in the neighborhood) have the same lateral coordinates as the Mn atoms in lattice places (i.e., substituting Ga atoms). However, the GID-XRSW measurement is sensitive to the presence of randomly placed Mn atoms (such as Mn in MnAs inclusions). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the XRSW scans calculated for constant α i for substitutional Mn and randomly placed Mn atoms in diffractions 400, 220, 200 and 420.</p><p>From the fits it follows that during the annealing, the relative density of randomly distributed Mn atoms with respect to Mn atoms in lattice and interstitial positions increased from 10 -3 to 3.10 -3 . This increase could be attributed to the growth of small MnAs clusters or to a gathering of the Mn atoms in a disturbed surface layer. A reliable explanation of this finding is not possible without additional experiments probing the positions of the Mn atoms close to the sample surface (using photoelectrons, for instance). This will be the subject of further investigations.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Václav Holý*, Department of Electronic Structures, Charles University, Ke Karlovu 5, 121 16 Prague, Department of Electronic Structures, Charles University, Ke Karlovu 5, 121 16 Prague, Czech Republic Oliva Pacherová*, Institute of Physics, Czech Acad.
