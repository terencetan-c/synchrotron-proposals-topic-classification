<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We brought two fossil specimens of transitional early land vertebrates from the Early Carboniferous: Westlothiana lizziae (NMS G.1990.72.1), and the only specimen of Casineria kiddi <ref type="bibr">(NMS G.1993.54.1)</ref>. These animals document evolutionary stages of adaptation to live on land and their skeletons are preserved within rock matrix, receiving only superficial study so far <ref type="bibr">(Smithson 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr">Paton et al. 1999)</ref>. The goal of the experiment was to visualise their anatomy of these important fossils in 3D, using high resolution phasecontrast tomography, and use that information to understand the origin of land vertebrates. We were allocated six shifts, having requested nine, due to a highly competitive round of proposals. The experimental setup aimed for a resolution of 8.95 microns for both specimens, and we were able to rapidly achieve a good configuration that gave clear tomograms separating fossil bone from rock matrix, thanks to the assistance and experience of our local contact. Each specimen was scanned in multiple, overlapping regions of interest (15 for Westlothiana; 22 for Casineria), that were then stitched together to make a single image volume using scripts wirtten by our local contact.</p><p>We received the data in April 2018 and established they are of high resolution and quality. Segmentation and anatomical interpretation form the basis of a NERC (UK research council) PhD research project started by Mr Ben Igielman in October 2019. Progress is very strong, and the student has largely complete reconstruction of the skull anatomy of Westlothiana, and parts of the skeleton of both Westlothiana and Casineria. Example images are presented on the next page.</p><p>Currently expected outcomes include a PhD thesis and mutliple publications describing the fossil specimens and their implications for the evolutionary transition to life on land in vertebrates.</p></div>
