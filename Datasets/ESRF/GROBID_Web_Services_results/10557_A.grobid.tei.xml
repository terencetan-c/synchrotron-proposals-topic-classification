<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In addition, crystals of Civl, a protein kinase for which beamtime has been allocated on the non-operational beamline EH4 (LS-897), were tested using the Mar CCD. These crystals diffracted weakly up to 3.5 i\; benefits of these preliminary data will be used to prepare new crystals for project LS-897. Finally, we tested a few crystals of a new project for which beamtime will be requested starting March 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Two data sets were collected on crystals of the AChE-Fas2 complex, a (( native )) form of the complex, and an (( inhibited 1) form, in which a ternary inhibitor acting at the catalytic site of AChE was soaked. The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6522 with cell dimensions:a=b=75A and c=550A. The diffraction quality of these frozen crystals were first tested with the Mar CCD with a crystal-to-detector distance of 147.8 A giving a maximal resolution of 2.2 A (h=0.947 A). The Large Imaging Plate detector (8000 x 4000 pixels) was then rapidly installed to allow data collection with a crystal-to-detector distance of 590 mm. Typically, 18 films were recorded for each crystal that correspond to a total oscillation of 36" along the c-axis with an oscillation step of 3'. Exposure time were setup to 15-20 sec per pass with a total of 12 passes (2/3 fill mode, I=150 mA). Films were then automatically scanned and the resulting files were then transformed to a format suitable for DENZO. On-line partial indexing of the initial images was successful; processing of these data is underway. The expected resolution is 2.6 A and 2.8 A for the native and inhibited form of these crystals, respectively. A large number of crystals of the homologous AChE-Fasl complex were also tested; however, no data could be collected on these crystals, which all appeared to be twinned or of a poor diffraction quality (maximal resolution achieved was about 5 A).</p></div>			</div>
