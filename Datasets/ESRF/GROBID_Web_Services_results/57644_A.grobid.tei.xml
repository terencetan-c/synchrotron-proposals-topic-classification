<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this experiment we observed successfully under load, i.e. in situ, the nucleation and propagation of a ductile crack in a notched sheet Aluminium sample. The observations were made at different scales:</p><p>1. a surface image was taken to identify the macroscopic sample opening and displacements 2. a single-distance scan of the material ahead of the notch with a pixel size of 240 nm was taken 3. a hololaminographic scan (4 distances) was taken to be able to reconstruct the data with a pixel size of 100 nm Several load steps were successfully applied until failure. The screw driven in situ device had been designed especially for this experiment and only weighs 40 g including the sample. The in situ Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Multiscale assessment for a loaded state; sections are given at the same locations and resolutions as for figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> device and the laminography set-up that had been transferred from id 22b were validated. The data was reconstructed.</p><p>It is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the unloaded state and for the loaded state (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) in terms of 2D sections. The gain of resolution in the holotomographic scan is clearly visible. Small dispersoid particles can now be discerned. Their fracture is seen for the loaded state (figure <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</p><p>The particles reveal to be useful markers for digital volume correlation. Digital volume correlation allows to track contrast and determine 3D displacement and strain fields in the material bulk. First attempts for DVC revealed to be successful. Hence local strain information will be gained at multiple scales for comparison with finite element modelling. A PhD student is currently working on the optimized reconstruction and segmentation of the data to identify damage nucleation and growth kinetics. Different phase reconstruction algorithms are tried including a quasi particle approach to identify the quality improvement of the hololaminographic scan compared to a single distance scan. This work is will be included in the first journal publication on this experiment.</p></div>
