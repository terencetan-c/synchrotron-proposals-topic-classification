<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the measurements was to contribute to the better understanding of real-time structure development of PEO/PMMA blends with the help of crystallization under high pressure. Crystallization of low-molecular fractions of PEO (Mw ~ 3000, 4000) / PMMA (Mw 1300, 3900) of 8/2 and 6/4 compositions were studied by time-resolved SAXS method.</p><p>The conditions of the experiment were as follows: wavelength 0.1 nm, sample detector distance 5 m, counting time per each frame 5s. Pressure up to 1600 bar was generated by syringe-type generator and transferred by water into the pressure cell with diamond windows.</p><p>After application of high-pressure to the molten blends followed by cooling, the PEO crystallizes in the most stable lamellar EC (extended chain) structures. The crystallization conditions at high pressures are apparently better than those at atmospheric pressure.</p><p>Application of high-pressure to the blends, already having the EC structure, results in partial transformation of lamellae into the unstable NIF (non-integral folding) structure. In the blend PEO3000/PMMA1200 (8/2) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) pressurized to 1400 bar at 52 o C the thickness of NIF lamellae starts at 13.6 nm and then grows up to 14.5 nm. After 100s NIF lamellae transform back to the EC crystals. Similarly, in the blend PEO3000/PMMA3900 (6/4) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) the pressure 1200 bar applied at 48 o C initiates NIF lamellae crystallization with the thickness of 14.8 nm, which grows up to 15.9 nm and disappears after 90 s.</p><p>The PEO4000/PMMA1200 (8/2) blend displays different structure behaviour (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>After applying pressure of 1350 bar at 52Â°C to the lamellar system with periodicity of 18.9 nm a part of these lamellae changes thickness to 15 nm. After 295 s this new lamellar system, apparently favored under high-pressure conditions, dominates but both systems remain preserved even during subsequent heating to 65 o C (600 s) and also after cooling and depressurizing (655 s). Then the structure slowly changes back to the one favored at atmospheric pressure. Due to the higher molecular weight of PEO the structures preferred at high or low pressure can co-exist for a long time. These both structures correspond to the unstable NIF lamellar systems. This has not been observed under atmospheric conditions.</p><p>The transition of NIF to IF crystals during isothermal crystallization had been attributed to the effort of the system to exclude all chain-ends from crystalline phase of lamellae. The development of NIF crystals after a pressure change is not simply explainable by this model. It is not probable, that pressure could return part of chain-ends back into the interior of crystals. Tilting of chains could cause the described thinning of lamellae after a pressure change. The formation of (only) NIF lamellar systems in blends with PEO4000 can be connected with higher molecular weight of PEO. The role of amorphous diluent PMMA to the structure development is also not clear. For better insight into the structure behaviour of these systems more systematic measurements at high-pressures are needed.</p><p>We thank the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic for support with grant No. 106/99/0557 </p></div>			</div>
