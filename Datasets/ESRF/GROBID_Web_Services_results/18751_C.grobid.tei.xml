<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We intend to determine the crystal structures of Ca 2+ complexes of some model proteins in order to examine functional and structural aspects of the biological role of the essential metal ion Ca 2+ . All data collections were carried out under cryogenic conditions at beamline ID 14-1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Physarum myosin II regulatory domain -Ca 2+ complex. A native dataset (unit cell: a=55.573 Å, b=70.596 Å, c=98.140 Å, P2 1 2 1 2 1 , resolution 1.8 Å, R merge =4.4%) and three derivative (Sm, Ho, Yb) datasets were collected. Phase problem was solved with SIRAS using the Yb derivative (resolution 2.3 Å). (MIRAS did not give better results.) Problems during model building and refinement: maps at the C terminal domain of the regulatory light chain are of poor quality and B-factors are high for this region. Attempts to improve that region of the model were unsuccessful (arp/warp, CNS, refmac, Shelx tried). Currently R and R free are 0.29 and 0.34, respectively. The disorder may be caused by the Histag of a symmetry equivalent molecule. Data collection from crystals of His-tag free protein was decided. Publication: Farkas, L., Debreczeni, J., Harmat, V., Kohama, K., Nakamura, A. and Nyitray, L. ( <ref type="formula">2002</ref>): Structure of Ca 2+ -bound regulatory domain of Physarum myosin II at 1.8 Å resolution: Ca 2+ is bound to a conventional EF-hand that is in a closed lobe conformation. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motility., in press.</p><p>Calmodulin-antagonist complexes. Unit cell of calmodulin-vinblastine crystals is a=b=40.91 Å, c= 341.70 Å, space group P6 1 22 (space group may be C222 1 with three fold non-crystallographic symmetry, a=40.91 Å b=70.87 Å c=341.70 Å). The long cell axis forced us to make a compromise concerning the resolution of the dataset. For acceptable resolution limits overlapping of certain amount of reflections could not be eliminated. We collected a 2.2 Å and a 3.5 Å resolution data sets from one crystal. R merge is 0.112 for the two datasets merged. Phase problem was solved with molecular replacement using data collected previously in our home laboratory. Attempts are being made to improve the quality of refinement (R and R free are 0.35 and 0.40, respectively at the moment). Crystals of the other calmodulin-antagonist complex (arylalkylamine type designed antagonist) diffracted to 2.6 Å that was not enough for seeing the ligand binding in details (unit cell dimensions a=b=40.53 Å, c=342.34 Å, space group P6 1 22, R merge =0.049).</p><p>Chymotrypsin A 1.3 Å resolution dataset was collected from a crystal of alphachymotrypsin (a=48.42 Å, b=66.63 Å, c=65.51 Å, β=102.2°, space group P2 1 , R merge =0.041). Though the structure does not contain bound Ca 2+ it can be a good reference molecule for studying the conformational effect of Ca 2+ binding. Refinement is in progress.</p></div>		</body>
