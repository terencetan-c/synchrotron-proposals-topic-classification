<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In recent years the study of uranium compounds has attracted much interest because of the variety of behaviors which can be found at low temperature. One of the key parameter which governs their physical properties is the degree of hybridization of the 5~ electrons with the conduction band electrons. This parameter can be estimated from the orbital to spin moment ratio of the 5~ orbital moment. Recent experiment al and theoretical works have shown that the Magnetic Circular X-ray Dichroism (MCXD) technique is a method to measure that ratio. We report the first MCXD measurements performed on a uranium compound at the ESRF. One way to probe the 5f electrons is to study the M V and M IV edges located at 3.5 keV and 3.7 keV. At these energies the measurements are difficult because the degree of circular polarization after the monochromator is not as large as at high or low energy. In fact the number of studies in this intermediate energy range is very small. The measurements have been performed at BL6 on USbO.bTeO.s. This compound, which crystallizes in the simple cubic NaCl structure, orders ferromagneticaly at ~ 200 K with its uranium magnetic moment (of 2 PB at low temperature) parallel to the [111] direction. The spectra have been recorded in fluorescence mode with the primary and secondary X-ray beams subtending the illuminated crystal face at angles a = 80° and /3 = 10°, respectively. A magnetic field of 2 T was applied parallel to the incident beam. The sample temperature was 100 K. The relative direction of the field to the light helicity has been selected either by changing the direction of the field or the helicity after each energy scan. Within uncertainties the resulting dichroism spectra are the same. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> we present the fluorescence spectrum 1 + and the dichroic asymmetry for the two edges. The two dichroic signals are positive indicating a strong orbital magnetic moment. Their ratio is N 6 with the signal weaker at the MV edge. Whereas the MIV dichroic signal is quite symmetric, the MV signal is highly asymmetric and presents structures. We note the extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS) between the two edges. Relative to the only published MCXD work on an uranium compound (US)</p><p>[1], our data are of a much better statistical quality. The two set of data agree on the qualitative level. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> are shown the absorption spectrum -y+ and the dichroic asymmetry deduced from the fluorescence spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) obtained after correction for the self-absorption effects using a formula given in Ref. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and published attenuation coefficient data <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. We note that the absorption correction has substantially modified the spectrum. While the analysis will be pursued to extract information on the orbit al and spin magnetic moments, we point out that magnetic dichroism of MIV,V fluorescence light is possible <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This dichroism will complicate the analysis.   Energy (eV)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>[I] S.P. Collins, D. Laundy, C.C. Tang and G. van der Laan, J.
