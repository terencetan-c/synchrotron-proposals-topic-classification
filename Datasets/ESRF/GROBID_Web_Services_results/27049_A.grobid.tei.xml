<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The study of the interaction of biomacromolecules with charged counter ions is of great interest for the understanding of principal biophysical processes and for the development of new materials. Biomolecules like DNA are often found in condensed states e.g. in chromosomes or virus heads. DNA aggregates are also discussed for possible gene carriers in gene therapy. To gain information about these systems a detailed analysis of the aggregation mechanism is needed.</p><p>Our model system consists of semidilute DNA solutions mixed with polypropyleneimine dendrimers generation 4 (G4) in aqueous solutions. The dendrimers are spherical polyamine molecules carrying positive charges. The mixing is performed inside a microfluidic mixing device composed of two perpendicular crossing channels (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The flows of the biomaterial solutions are controlled by syringe pumps.[1] The syringe pumps are home-build devices which allow us to continuously pump very low rates (10 -9 l/s). The resulting experimental flow velocities are in between ~100µm/s and 1000µm/s. The channels were spark-erroded into a stainless steel plate (300µm thickness), covered with thin kapton foils and connected to the syringe pumps at the three inlet channels. The system was mounted onto the ID10b goniometer and the x-ray beam was microfocused at the sample position by beryllium compound refractive lenses to a horizontal beam diameter of ~20µm. The scattering image was taken by using a CCD-camera at a sample-CCD distance of 25cm. Using the system sketched in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, flow induced orientation (1), diffusive mixing (2) and time evolution of the reaction ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) &amp; ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) can be studied. A center stream containing long chain molecules gets accelerated and focused by two symmetric side streams. The hydrodynamic focusing area (2), where incoming material (1) senses the maximum elongational flow, gives access to different concentration gradients along the fluid microjet and perpendicular to it depending on the diffusive mixing behavior, the velocity ratio of the center channel to the side channels and the overall flow velocity. For the diffusive mixing of DNA molecules and dendrimers the diffusion of long chain DNA into the G4 solutions can be neglected since the mobility of the long chain DNA molecules is much less than of G4 and additionally the DNA is elongated perpendicular to the diffusion direction.</p><p>The final concentration at position ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) is known from the initial concentrations and a good approximation for the concentration gradients at positions along the microjet can be achieved by numerical simulations. Since the whole system is dominated by laminar flow each position along the jet represents a steady state in reaction evolution (3) &amp; (4). By tuning the flow velocity we can also tune the time frame which we are looking at. Imaging the area of interest in a step by step scan (cross section of the jet or along the symmetry axis) we can visualize the reaction in a very detailed way.</p><p>In first experiments the hydrodynamic focusing of a center-stream of semidilute DNA solution (polydisperse DNA with an average length of 5µm) by two equivalent side streams of water was observed. The center stream gets accelerated to a fluid microjet and the DNA molecules sense an elongational flow which results in a higher degree of orientation.[2] An additional effect is the pre-elongation inside the inlet channel due to viscous flow. This orientation strongly depends on the concentration of the semidilute DNA solution since the viscosity changes dramatically when going from 20mg/ml DNA to 40mg/ml DNA (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In our recent experiments the side streams were additionally carrying a variable amount of G4 dendrimers which are known to condense DNA and g enerate different collumnar phases depending on the relative charge ratio. 150µm Figure 3: SAXS images taken at different channel positions.

Depending on the z -position along the channel, different columnar phases are observed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Sketch of a microfluidic focusing device.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the observation position and the flow rates. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows as an example a scan along the z-axis. Here, a transition from the hexagonal (H') to the square regime according to the phase diagram of ref. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> occurs. In contrast to bulk measurements, our method gives access to investigate the interactions of DNA and G4 in a situation where the DNA/G4 aggregate is elongated due to the hydrodynamic focusing flow. Two coexisting states of different intensities inside the bulk H' phase can be observed by scanning the imaging position in x-direction from the center of the channel crossing to the microjet boundary with a step size of 20µm (fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). In the center region (fig. <ref type="figure">2-(</ref>2)), where the dendrimer concentration is relatively low but the flow elongation is maximal, a double peak referring to a G4 enriched phase corresponding to q 1 and a G4 depleted phase corresponding to q 2 is found. In this state dendrimers are continuously added to the DNA matrix. Regions of an enriched phase in coexistence with regions of a depleted phase including a diffuse transition region in between can be clearly determined (fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>). This can be seen by the transition from the two peaks at d=3.2nm and d=2.6nm to a single peak at d=3.2nm varying the x -position. The depleted phase corresponds to a dense packing of the DNA with an intramolecular spacing close to the diameter of single DNA molecules. The grey area represents the transition region from hexagonal' phase to a square lattice phase. A double phase with an dendrimer enriched and a dendrimer depleted state to a square lattice phase can be found in the transition region. </p></div>			</div>
