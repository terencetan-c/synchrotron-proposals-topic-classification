<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>There has been an increasing interest in developing novel catalysts for hydrotreating reactions in order to comply with the more stringent environmental regulations. Recently, transition metal phosphides have been reported to show better hydrodenitrogenation activities than the traditional molybdenum sulfide catalyst <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The knowledge of the structure of the active component is mandatory for understanding the catalytic activity of these materials. However, the catalysts are usually prepared on a support, like Al 2 O 3 or SiO 2 on which the active particles are highly dispersed with particle sizes below 5 nm. Since no other laboratory technique is suitable for the analyzes of the structure of the active components, we aim to utilize EXAFS as a characterization tool for the supported CoMoP catalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The catalysts were pressed in self-supported wafers, and mounted in a sealed EXAFS cell. In this work, we investigate the SiO 2 -supported CoMoP and Co 2 P catalysts and we compare them with the bulk materials.</p><p>Mo K-edge and Co K-edge EXAFS spectra were recorded in transmission mode at liquid nitrogen temperature. The program XDAP -version 2.3.3 was used to analyze and fit the data as described in the literature <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>AvrÃ hsrqÃ hqÃ urÃ xÂx 3 Mo K-edge EXAFS functions of the bulk and supported CoMoP catalysts in the range of 3.1 Å&lt; k &lt;18 Å are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The spectra are nearly identical revealing that the same structure is formed when the phosphide is prepared as a bulk material or supported on SiO 2 .</p><p>The data analysis shows an overlapping of two P and one Co shells in the region from 2.4 and 2.7 Å (phase-corrected). A second Mo-Mo shell was found at a distance of 3.05 Å and a third P shell was found at 3.42 Å (phase-corrected). Similar coordination numbers were obtained for the bulk and supported CoMoP materials. However, data analysis showed that less Co atoms and consequently more Mo atoms were found to be coordinated to a Mo atom. Investigation of the Co K-edge for both materials confirmed that Co are coordinated to more Co atoms than Mo atoms when comparing the data to the theoretical values of a CoMoP compound <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. We believe that Co is not only present in a CoMoP structure but also present in a segregated phosphide phase.</p></div>
