<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>High pressure (HP) dramatically changes the chemistry of materials. Quantum-chemical calculations predict unusual but stable stoichiometries of alkali halides, such as, for example, NaCl3 and NaCl7, Na2Cl, Na3Cl2 and Na4Cl3, LinI (n = 2-5), and CsFm (m = 2-6), and suggest uncommon properties. Despite the numerous predictions, very few of them have been experimentally confirmed. So far, the synthesis of the compounds with the stoichiometries AX3, A3X, and AX5 (A is an alkali metal, X is a halogen) have been reported at high pressures. The list includes, for example, polymorphs of NaCl3 (space groups Pnma and Pm3 ̅ n), KCl3 (Pm3 ̅ n and P3 ̅ c1), KBr3 (Pnma and P3 ̅ c1), CsI3 (Pnma, P3 ̅ c1, and Pm3 ̅ n), as well as Na3Cl (P4/mmm) and KBr5 (P21) compounds. The majority of them were characterized in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Le Bail analysis, and only the two polymorphs of CsI3 (Pnma and P3 ̅ c1) were studied using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). Although the synergy of powder XRD and ab initio structure predictions is very helpful to obtain a structure solution, the interpretation of some powder XRD remains ambiguous (e.g., those of KBr3 and KBr5).</p><p>As planned and described in the beamtime proposal, we aimed to study the alkali halide systems which halogen atoms have a great potential to be stablized in polyhalogen anions. Seven diamond anvil cells equipped with 250 or 120 μm culets loaded with LiF, LiCl, LiBr, or a piece of Mg metal together with the halogens source (CF4, CCl4, and CBr4), respectively, were brought to the ID11 beamline. The samples were laser-heated at regular pressure intervals after which they were mapped with the X-ray beam in order to determine if a chemical reaction had occurred. When new diffraction lines different with the starting materials were observed, a singlecrystal X-ray diffraction data collection was performed.</p><p>Through the investigation of the laser-heated samples, we successfully synthesized a novel magnesium chloride with the composition of Mg3Cl7 in the pressure range of 44 to 73 GPa. The compound has an unusual chemical bonding with evidences of covalent-ionic mixing in the structure. This is one more example that HP can stabilize compounds with very different (unusual) chemical bonding characteristics (the Mg-Cl interaction at 1 bar is completely ionic).</p><p>The aim of the experiment has been partailly achieved. The publication is under preparation and the ID11 stuff will be included as a co-author.</p></div>		</body>
