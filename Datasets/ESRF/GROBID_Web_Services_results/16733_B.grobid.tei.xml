<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>a much sharper than expected resonant line-shape that could not be modeled to a standard dipole oscillator <ref type="bibr">[Mannix et al. RRB 60 (1999)</ref> 15187]. One of the aims of this present experiment was therefore to examine the line shapes of the resonant scattering from the (U x Np 1-x )O 2 mixed oxides. The data in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show the response of the resonant magnetic scattering as the photon energy is increased across the U and Np M 5 and M 4 absorption edges of (U 0.75 Np 0.25 )O 2 . We have modeled these resonances to 4 dipole oscillators that interfere with each other. The fit to these data includes a preliminary sample absorption correction of 1/µ, which takes into account the white-lines estimated from absorption measurements of UO 2 . Another aspect of this experiment is that in using this element specific technique we can relate the respective amplitudes of the M edge resonances to obtain a ratio of the uranium to neptunium magnetic moments. By comparing the relative amplitudes of the signals after normalizing them by the atom concentrations our results suggest a Np/U moment ratio smaller than found by a combination of neutron and Mössbauer studies. Following theoretical crystal-field calculations we will compare the relative strengths of these mixed oxide M edge resonances with those of the previously studied (U 1-x Np x )Ru 2 Si 2 alloys <ref type="bibr">[Lidstrom et al. PRB 61 (2000)</ref> 1375].</p><p>The temperature dependencies of the normalized integrated intensities of the (1 1 2) magnetic peak measured at the U and Np M 4 resonances are shown in figure 2. On lowering the temperature the Np moments order at a slower rate than the U atoms. The ordering parameters for U and Np are 0.32 and 0.42, respectively, obtained from fits to the I=I 0 (1-T/T N ) 2β power law near to T N . This appears to be consistent with a picture of the Np moments being "pulled-up" by the molecular field of the U atoms.</p><p>However, unexpectedly the U and Np sublattices appear to have different ordering temperatures (T N =17.5 K for U and 16.8K for the Np sublattice) and so it is difficult to model this system using a simple molecular field model <ref type="bibr">[Huppeld et al. EPL 49 (2000)</ref> 92].</p><p>The temperature dependence of the (4 2 1) forbidden reflection is also shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This charge scattering arises due an internal distortion of the oxygen sublattice induced by the magnetic ordering, as previously observed for pure UO 2 . Interestingly, it follows rather closely the temperature dependence of the Np magnetic scattering. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Normalized integrated intensity as a function of energy for the (1 1 2) AF reflection of (Np 0.75 U 0.25 )O 2 .
