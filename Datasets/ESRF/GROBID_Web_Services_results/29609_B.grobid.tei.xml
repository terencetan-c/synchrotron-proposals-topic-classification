<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>According to the project plan, we recorded the XANES spectra at the V K-edge of mixed transition metal oxides with catalytic activity in the gas phase selective oxidation of light alkanes, most specially the one with the chemical composition Sb 0.15 MoV 0.20 O x submitted to different treatments. In the previous session, we recorded the XANES spectra at the Sb L 1 edge of these samples in order to determine the oxidation state of Sb, an information which is not easy to get by any other spectroscopic technique. The aim of these measurements was to find out if the modification in the oxidation state of Sb with the catalyst treatment can be correlated with changes in the coordination enviroment of V. Some of the treatment used for the sample preparation are: i) calcination under N 2 at 600 ºC, ii) treatment under N 2 at 600 ºC followed by calcination with air at 450 ºC, iii) catalyst ii after its use in the catalytic test, iv) oxidized with air at 280 ºC and then treated with N 2 at 600 ºC. The analysis of the Sb L I XANES spectra recorded in the previous session show that, as a general trend, in the calysts heated with N 2 Sb is as Sb 3+ , while when it is treated under oxygen or air in any stage of the catalyst preparation, Sb is partially oxized and a mixture of Sb 3+ and Sb 5+ appear. However, the changes in the V K-edge of the same samples are not so evident and it is not easy to find a correlation between the evolution of the V and Sb coordination state in the samples. As an example, Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and 1b show the V Kedge XANES spectra of the sample treated with N 2 at 600 ºC, and with air at 280 ºC. While in the former Sb is as Sb 3+ , in the latter there is a mixture of Sb 3+ /Sb 5+ (50:50, approximately). However, only small differences are observed in the V pre-edge region. The main spectral features of the spectra are consistent with both both V 4+ and V 5+ . However, the former appear to be more probable according to our results.</p><p>Besides this, we investigated the oxidation state of V in the fresh samples of chemical composition Sb 0.15 MoV 0.20 Nb 0.15 O x synthesized at different pH, as the performance of the final catalyst depends on the specific sample preparation. In these catalysts, with Sb is as Sb 3+ , the oxidation state of V is not clear. As an example, figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the XANES spectra of two samples synthesized at pH=1,5 (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and pH=4,3 (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). Both spectra are consistent with V 4+ in a , and only subtle differences area observed among them.</p><p>The results obtained will be correlated whith the catalytic performance of the materials investigated, which will allow the publication of at least two paper wich are under preparation. 5460 5465 5470 5475 5480 5485 5490 5495 5500 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2 b KeV a u.a.</p><p>eV eV</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1Figure2</figDesc></figure>
