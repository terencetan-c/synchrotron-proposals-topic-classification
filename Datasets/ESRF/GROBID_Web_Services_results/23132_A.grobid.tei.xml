It is one of the few organisms that grows in the Dead Sea. Since D. salina</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>is photosynthetic, it requires a mechanism to take up CO 2 from the environment. A key player in CO 2 uptake in any organism is the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which converts bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 -) to CO 2 and vice versa. One of the carbonic anhydrases located on the surface of the organism was cloned and isolated. It shows the unusual property of having activity in both high and low salt conditions, in contrast to halophilic enyzmes which are inactive in low salt conditions, and mesophilic enzymes which are inactive at high salt concentrations. Since molecular replacement with known carbonic anyhdrase structures did not work, we wanted to use the zinc ion bound in the active site for a MAD experiment. The protein is a 30KD chain which forms a dimer. The space group was P2 1 with 2 molecules per asymmetric unit. Thus we had 2 zinc atoms per 60KD ASU. Since technical failure at a different beam-line prevented us from collecting useful data, we applied to BM-14 for fast access in the autumn of 2001, collecting data on the 19 th of November, 2001.</p><p>We were able to get a very clear anomalous signal from the active site zinc ions, giving very sharp Patterson maps after 270˚ of data, although we collected 360˚ for better accuracy (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). For data collection statistics, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The data gave very clear MAD maps using CNS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), which allowed tracing of ~85% of both chains in the dimer without using NCS.</p><p>Refinement is essentially complete and analysis of the structure under way.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure 1: Harker section of anomalous Patterson map from 360˚ of data.
