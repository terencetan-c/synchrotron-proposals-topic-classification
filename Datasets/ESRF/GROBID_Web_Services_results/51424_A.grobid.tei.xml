<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment suffered from issues with sample stability, which were eventually traced down to contamination in the provided glassy carbon tubes. ~9 shifts were spent 'debugging' these issues and calibrating the temperature in the autoclave.</p><p>The experiment scope had to be reduced accordingly. We had two aims for this experiment.</p><p>(1) Confirm experimentally some features of Zn(II) complexing in the chloride solutions predicted from ab initio (i.e. first principle) molecular dynamics simulations. We measured 4 solutions at different Zn:Cl ratios from room-T to 500˚C at 1000 bar and were able to (i) confirm the persistence of high order Cl complexes (ZnCl 3 -and ZnCl 4 2-) up to high temperature (500˚C, 1000 bar) and (ii) provide evidence that with increasing temperature, ZnCl 3 -becomes increasingly present as a trigonal planar [ZnCl 3 ] -form rather than the tetrahedral [ZnCl 3 (H 2 O)] -form predominant at lower temperature, via a careful analysis of the XANES data.</p><p>These results have been submitted for publication to Geochimica Cosmochica Acta. As of today (August 20 th ), we're working on addressing 'major revisions' that result from reviewers' concerns with the MD method used to obtain quantitative thermodynamic information on Zn-Cl complexing, and the development of a thermodynamic model valid over a wide range of P,T. We're confidant that we can address the issues. The good news is that no reviewer attacked our interpretation of the XANES and EXAFS data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract of the submitted manuscript:</head><p>The solubility of zinc minerals in hydrothermal fluids is enhanced by chloride complexation of Zn 2+ . Thermodynamic models of these complexation reactions are central to models of Zn transport and ore formation. However, existing thermodynamic models, derived from solubility measurements, are inconsistent with spectroscopic measurements of Zn speciation.</p><p>Here, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to predict the speciation of Zn-Cl complexes from 25-600 ºC. Qualitatively, the simulations reproduced the main features derived from in situ XANES and EXAFS measurements: octahedral to tetrahedral transition with increasing temperature and salinity, stability of ZnCl 4 2-at high chloride concentration up to ≥500 ºC, and increasing stability of the trigonal planar [ZnCl 3 -] complex at high temperature. This excellent qualitative agreement serves to ground proof the MD model and enticed us to attempt a fully quantitative ab initio study via the thermodynamic integration method. Remarkably, the stability constants for the Zn-Cl complexes derived from the ab initio simulations accurately predict the experimentally observed changes in ZnO (s) and ZnCO 3(s) solubility as a function of chloride concentration from 200/P sat to 600 ºC/2 kbar. We find large changes in Zn-Cl complexation with temperature. We confirm that the [ZnCl 4 ] 2-complex dominates in salty fluids even at T &gt; 400 ºC and provide a thermodynamic model that is consistent with MD, XAS data and existing solubility studies up to 600 ˚C. This study shows that quantitative molecular dynamic techniques can alleviate uncertainties in the interpretation of solubility data, and are especially useful at high temperature due to the faster kinetics of the ligand exchange reactions.</p><p>(2) Provide the first in-situ spectroscopic information on the nature and stability of Zn(II) bisulfide complexes. We originally planned to perform a series of measurements for solutions with different concentrations of bisulphide. However, the ZnS(s) solubility was about one order of magnitude lower than expected. Because of this and with regard to the time lost for commissioning, we had to change the focus of the experiment, and instead focussed on getting good quality XANES and EXAFS out of a single 2 m NaHS solution. The results, however, are key to confirm the predictions from ab initio MD that contrary to chloride, the bisulfide ligand does not form tetrahedral complexes with Zn(II); rather, a trigonal planar Zn(HS) 3 -complex is formed. We have finished the ab initio MD simulations for this system, and plan to submit a paper on the role of hydrogen bonding in determining the transport of metals in hydrothermal systems, using the contrast between Zn bisulfide and Zn chloride complexes as a case study.</p></div>		</body>
