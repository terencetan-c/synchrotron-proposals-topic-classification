<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment CH-6073, performed at the ID22 High-Resolution Powder Diffraction Beamline, aimed to get information on the CO2 adsorption properties of the MOF Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 and Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4bis(pyrazol-4-yl)benzene; H2BDP-NH2 = 1,4-bis(pyrazol-4-yl)amino benzene], which are isotructural metal organic frameworks characterised by a 3D network with 1D triangular channels. The peculiar shape of their channels and good Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (1230 m 2 /g for the non-functionalized MOF) prompted its investigation as CO2 storage material. Fe2(BDP)3 has been isolated and characterized in the recent past as per its crystal structure, textural properties (by means of N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K) and performance in C6H14 isomers separation.[1] The isomorphous amino-tagged counterpart Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 has been now prepared and fully characterized in the solid state in our labs, this including investigation of its porosity (through N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K). As disclosed by PXRD, none of the two MOFs loses crystallinity or shows phase transitions after being probed with N2 or CO2. More interestingly, we have studied Fe2(BDP)3 and Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 for CO2 separation from N2/CO2 85:15 binary mixtures (T = 273-353 K) and the breakthrough experiments showed that Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 outperforms Fe2(BDP)3 in the studied conditions. HR-PXRD in situ and operando measurements were performed working at 35 keV (λ = 0.354 Å, calibrated with the Si NIST standard SRM 640c at room temperature). Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 was activated and introduced into a 0.5 mm-diameter borosilicate glass capillary in our lab prior to the experiment. The capillary was first aligned, then connected to the gas handling system. The sample was further activated at 453 K under vacuum (10 -6 bar) by means of a turbo vacuum pump for approximately 2 h. All the measurements were carried out on the same capillary, changing its position to avoid radiation damage; an equilibration time of 15 min was applied at each CO2 pressure before acquiring the HR-PXRD data.[2] The latter were collected at T = 273 and 298 K, while varying the CO2 loading in the pressure range 0-35 bar. Prior to CO2 dosage, space group and unit cell parameters were validated performing whole powder pattern refinements (TOPAS-Academic V6) on the data collected at 0 bar at both temperatures. The high quality of the HR-PXRD data enabled us to perform the planned structural study at T = 273 and 298 K. The Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 framework was built up starting from the ambient-conditions crystal structure published for the non-functionalized MOF [1] and refined with the Rietveld method working on the 0 bar data. The two independent ligands and the CO2 molecule were modelled as rigid bodies. For both ligands, the presence of orientational disorder affecting the central phenyl ring was taken into consideration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The primary CO2 adsorption sites were located by means of the Simulated Annealing approach and then refined through the Rietveld method. Comparing the HR-PXRD data of Fe2(BDP-NH2)3 upon CO2 adsorption, neither loss of crystallinity, nor amorphization or phase transition were observed in the studied range of temperatures and pressures. A preliminary whole powder pattern refinement showed a first unit cell volume contraction in the CO2 pressure range 0-1 bar, followed by a slight expansion (V &lt; 1%), both related to CO2 loading. In order to localise and quantify the adsorbed CO2, assessment of the guest position and orientation followed by Rietveld refinement is currently in progress. To now it can be show that three primary adsorption sites with different occupancy were invariably identified, irrespective of the essayed conditions. Interestingly, both at 273 and 298 K, the applied CO2 pressure affects the degree of positional disorder featured by the central phenyl ring of one of the two independent ligands and of the amino groups interacting with the CO2 molecules. The amount of CO2 adsorbed increases applying higher pressures and it is inversely proportional to the adsorption temperature. Monte Carlo simulations are currently in progress to further strengthen the correctness of the experimental findings. Our structural insight will provide key information to shed light on the chemical and structural properties a host should possess for efficient CO2 adsorption and separation at rather mild conditions.</p></div>		</body>
