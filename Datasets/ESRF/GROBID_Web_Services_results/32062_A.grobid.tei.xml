<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Based on the results of experiments MI 686 and MI 770, the experiment has aimed at lensless imaging of nanocrystals applying the coherent cone beam provided by an X-ray waveguide. An important experimental improvement compared to MI 770 was the application of a directillumination CCD camera, which provides higher detection efficiency and a smaller pixel size resulting in greatly improved quality of the recorded images.</p><p>We have imaged micron-sized Cu islands prepared by pulsed-laser-deposition on a thin Si foil with the waveguide beam and the individual islands can be directly recognized in the recorded image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). To resolve smaller features, the recorded image has to be considered an in-line hologram and a holographic reconstruction is necessary <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We have recorded several in-line holograms of a lithographically-prepared test structure. A reconstructed phase image is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The sample consists of gold structures with a thickness of 150 nm and we find a spatial resolution of below 400 nm. However, from the cross-sectional dimensions of the waveguide we had expected a resolution below 100 nm. Furthermore the image is significantly disturbed by artifacts. This is probably related to the inherent "twin image" problem of in-line holography.</p><p>This "twin image" problem can be overcome by two-beam holography techniques. Thus we have carried out a waveguide-based off-axis holography experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, left). Two coherently illuminated slightly curved waveguides provide two coherent cone beams. One waveguide illuminates the sample while the other one provides an additional reference wave. This enables the recording of a magnified off-axis hologram, from which much better phase images can be calculated. We have recorded multiple off-axis holograms of a small tungsten tip. Numerical reconstruction has yielded phase images of high quality and a spatial resolution of about 100 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>In summary, the technique of waveguide-based hard-X-ray imaging was strongly improved during this experiment. In particular the feasibility of waveguide-based in-line holography and off-axis holography was demonstrated. Highest resolution of about 100 nm and best image quality is achieved by off-axis holography. Micron-sized Cu islands have been imaged and in principle one might decrease the distance between the waveguide and the sample to illuminate single islands, which can then be studied by X-ray diffraction or fluorescence. The investigation of smaller particles like nanocrystals will require smaller waveguide cross-sectional dimensions and higher flux than currently available. However, they will likely be available in near future.  [1] C.
