<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Michael Hons We have applied for 9 shifts on the Titan KRIOS to collect data on a functional RNA polymerase elongation complex in August 2018. We were scheduled in November 2018 (23/11 -25/11). Our local contact was Michael Hons. Two users from our team travelled to the ESRF. We brought several grids from two different batches with different sample concentrations. We pre-screened grids on our Polara microscope, which were frozen under identical conditions. Thanks to the outstanding support by our local contact we were able to screen the grids on the first day, identify a good one, and select enough squares and holes to collect data that gave us almost 5000 images over the course of three days of data collection.</p><p>We had collected on a related RNA polymerase elongation complex before but needed additional data on a mutant to be able and compare it to the wild-type complex. We brought twelve grids frozen under different conditions and Michael Hons, our local contact, helped us screen 8 grids on the first day. After identifying a good one he selected all the holes for data acquisition and everything went very smooth. On the second day of data collection (a Saturday), he suggested to change the strategy because he noticed the quality was not as good as could be. After confirming the microscope alignment Michael and the users from my team decided to collect on thinnner ice to improve signal to noise. Michael helped us to do this and continued to select holes after the users had to leave to catch their train. We are very grateful for the excellent support that we received. We would not have been able to get the quality and size of the dataset without his support. We have now initiated data transfer and will proceed to process as soon as we receive the complete dataset. We have collected data from closely related complexes at Titan KRIOS microscopes equipped with K2 cameras at IGBMC, Strasbourg, Biozentrum Basel, Switzerland, EMBL -Heidelberg, Germany, and NeCEN, the Netherlands and at the ESRF -one of our past ESRF datasets gave us the highest resolution we have obtained so far and so we are excited about this one.</p><p>If possible, I will update this report as soon as we know more about the final reconstruction.</p></div>			</div>
