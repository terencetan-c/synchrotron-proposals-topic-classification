<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Natural killer (NK) cells represent a first line of difense of the immune system against transformed and virally infected cells. NK cells lyse abnormal cell that either lack the expression or express inadequate ammounts of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The ability of NK cells to discriminate between normal and neoplastic/virus-infected cells is therefore linked to the existence of triggering receptors that recognize specific non-MHC ligands on these target cells. Some of these receptors have been recently identified and collectively named Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors (NCR). NCRs consist of glycoproteins which are expressed on the NK cellular surface and, upon interaction with the specific targets, induce cytokine production, cytotoxicity and migration. NKp44 (1) and NKp46 (2) belong to the NCR family and act as NK-specific, triggering surface proteins.</p><p>NKp44 is a 44kDa protein characterized by a single extracellular Ig V-type domain and it is selectively expressed by activated NK cells. NKp46 contains two C2-type Ig-like domains in the extracellular portion followed by a stretch of amino acids which connects the ectodomain to the transmembrane region. It represents the main receptor responsible for natural cytotoxicity and induces Ca ++ mobilization and cytokine release. Structural studies are now in progress in order to gain insight the molecular basis of NK mediated cytolysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection at ESRF</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NKp44</head><p>A native dataset and several putative heavy atom derivatives have been collected on NKp44 crystals. Crystals belong to the P6 2 22 space group. Data analysis is currently in progress, as well as attempts to solve the structure with the molecular replacement technique. There is, however, sone indication that crystal may suffer merohedral twinning (twinning fraction close to 50%), that may hinder the structure solution until the twinning fraction is reduced to a more amenable value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NKp46</head><p>Data collection was carried out on native crystals, to a resolution limit of 3.2Å. The space group is C222 1 .</p><p>Due to the reduced crystal size, NKp46 structure solution should be pursued at a synchrotron site</p></div>
