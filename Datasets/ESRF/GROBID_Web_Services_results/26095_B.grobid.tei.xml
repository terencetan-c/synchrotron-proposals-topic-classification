<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>G. Hible, A. Ghosh, L. Renault : Structural studies of the Arf and GBP1 regulatory GTP-binding proteins and of a bacterial Guanylate Mono-Phosphate Kinase (GMPK) (1 shift):</p><p>We used 1 shift beam time on BM30A to test small crystals of different protein-protein or proteinligands complexes, but could not collect any data sets due to the poor quality of crystals combined to the weak beam intensity (16 bunch mode).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural study of a bacterial Guanylate Kinase:</head><p>Guanylate Kinase (GMPK) is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that is essential for the biosynthesis of GTP and dGTP by catalyzing the reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to (d)GMP to yeld ADP and (d)GDP. In addition, antiviral prodrugs like Aciclovir, and anticancer prodrugs, are dependent of this enzymze for their activation. Our aim is to characterize the catalytic intermediates and use the structures as models for the activation of antiviral prodrugs.</p><p>We tested several crystals of different complexes of GMPK bound to nucleotide. A crystal of GMPK-GMP-ADPnP diffracted at 3,9Å resolution and had identical parameters with the crystal on wich we collected a dataset on the 26/04/2003 on BM30-A (space group P4 with unit cell parameters : a=b=108Å c=280Å, α=β=γ=90°). Given that the crystal has a big unit cell, exhibit a high mosaïcity and that the beam intensity mode was only 16 bunch, we didn't have enough time to collect a complete dataset with suitable small oscillations. It seems that the different complexes of GMPK with nucleotides or analogues give crystals with parameters which are not favorable with the use of molecular replacement (estimation of the Matthews parameters give 10 to 20 molecules per asymmetric unit and the only avaible model is monomeric). So we are thinking of producing heavy-atom derivatives in order to solve the structures by MAD or MIRAS.</p><p>Structural study of the GEF-catalysed activation of Arf small GTP-binding protein: Arf G proteins functions as binary switches in regulating transport vesicle budding in endocytosis and exocytosis and phospholipase D activation by cycling between inactive cytosolic GDP-bound and active membrane-anchored GTP-bound states. Like many other regulatory G proteins, the conversion of Arf-GDP to Arf-GTP is intrinsically very slow and is catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) along a complex multi-step reaction which is poorly understood at the molecular level. This reaction involves transient binary and ternary complexes between G protein, guanine nucleotide, and GEF. We have crystallized full length Arf1 in presence of the Sec7 domain of ARNO GEF. Crystals were too small and too weakly diffracting (3.5 Å at the most) to collect within 1 shift in the beam mode a complete data set in P1 with high mosaicity and a longer unit cell parameter of 205 Å.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Béatrice Golinelli, Clotilde Husson, Stéphane Mouilleron (1.5 shifts) : tRNA methyltransferase and glucosamine-6-P synthase and pyridoxal-P dependent catalytic antibody</head><p>Several very small crystals of dimethylguanine tRNA methyltransferase were tested but they did not diffract.</p><p>Crystals of a Cys-Ala mutant of glucosamine-6-P synthase in complex with glutamine and fructose-6-P were tested in different cryoconditions. In the best cryoprotectant, ethylene glycol, the crystals diffracted to 3.5 Å resolution. The space group seems to be primitive rhombohedral with a unit cell of a=b=c=250Å, α=β=γ=60. The minimum exposure was 2 min per image. As we were running out of time, we tried to collect a 90° data set with a ∆φ of 1° (instead of 0.5°), although there were too many overlaps. However, the dataset could not be processed. Different crystals, grown in two different condtions, of wild type glucosamine-6-P synthase in complex with inhibitors of the two binding sites were tested in different cryoconditions. The best crystal diffracts to 2.7 Å resolution and belongs to a primitive monoclinic space group with a unit cell of a=70.45, b=59.37, c=109.2, α=β=90, γ=100.</p><p>Very small crystals of a pyridoxal-P dependent catalytic antibody in complex with a phosphopyridoxylDalanine sybstrate analog were tested but did not diffract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pierre Briozzo (0.5 shifts) : Cochaperonine and uridine monophosphate kinase</head><p>On 13 May, on the FIP beamline, two sort of crystals were tried : -Of a cochaperonin from mouse (HIP), which unfortunately did not diffract.</p><p>-Of uridine monophosphate kinase from Escherichia coli. Several crystals were tried, but none of them diffracted to a better resolution, or with less apparent mosaicity than the data previously collected on ID14-2 on February.</p></div>			</div>
