Rossberg Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): C. Le Naour*, D. Trubert*, M.V. Di Giandomenico*, Institut de Physique Nucléaire Orsay C. Hennig*, ESRF-ROBL, FZR C. Den Auwer*, C. Fillaux*, A. Jeanson*, P. Moisy, CEA Valrhô Report:</p><p>XAS measurements on Pa samples were carried out on the Rossendorf Beam Line (BM20) at ESRF under dedicated ring conditions (6.0GeV at 200mA). Data were collected in the fluorescence mode with a Si (111) water cooled monochromator used in channel-cut mode. For all Pa samples, data were acquired at the Pa L III edge (16733 eV). Unlike the other actinides U, Np, Pu that exhibit a linear trans dioxo bond in their higher oxidation states, Pa (V) species in aqueous solution, has been proved to possess one single oxo bond (in concentrated H 2 SO 4 ) or no oxo bond in HF 0,5 M (User Report 32757). This experiment was performed with the aim of getting further information about the structure and the coordination of protactinium (V).</p><p>Samples prepared in phosphoric and perchloric acids could not be measured because of Pa precipitation. Polymerization of Pa(V) is known to occur with erratic induction time, especially in perchloric media. However the characterization of an aquo species of Pa(V) would assist in future analysis of protactinium complexes with various ligands. Despite these experimental difficulties, we would like to perform new XAS measurements with "fresh" samples by minimizing time between preparation and experiment on ROBL. This time can be reduced to about 10 hours (instead of more than 10 days) by informing in advance the local contact, the EHO and the Radiation Protection Group of ESRF and IPN Orsay.</p><p>In dilute HF media (&lt;10 -3 M), mono-oxo-fluorocomplexe(s) is (are) described in the literature, unfortunately at tracer scale (C Pa &lt; 10 -10 M). Only one oxo bond is therefore expected. The XANES spectrum registered during this experiment on the sample of following composition: 10 -2 M HF and 6.8 10 -3 Pa(V), does not exhibit the feature of a linear trans-dioxo bond. However, from our previous results (Pa-O @ 1.72 Å in H 2 SO 4 and Pa-F @ 2.16 Å in HF 0.5 M), the difference between Pa-oxo and Pa-F distances is expected to be small, leading to an ambiguity with regards to the presence or not of a single oxo bond in these species.</p><p>Figure below presents the experimental and fitted Pa L III edge EXAFS spectra of samples in HF 10 -2 (red) and 0.5 M (blue). In HF 0.5 M, best fit parameters have been obtained with 7 fluoride ligands at 2.16(2) Å; this pure fluoride ligation agrees with quantum chemistry calculations, leading to PaF 7 2-at 2.18 Å. On the other hand, in dilute HF medium, results of the fit tend to indicate the presence of one oxo bond at 1.71 Å and 7 F(or O) atoms at 2.13(2) Å. However, these results remain ambiguous, due to the too small difference between both distances. New measurements on Pa samples in diluted fluoride media at higher k values than recorded in this experiment could remove this ambiguity.</p></div>
