<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The structures of 11th and 12th group metal cyanamides were systematically studied at ambient conditions by using X-ray and neutron diffraction, recently, and the cyanamides display a rich degree of various crystal structures, depending on the cations present[1-3]. However, the high pressure behavior of cyanamides is unknown up to now. In addition to some general interest in the high pressure behavior of metal cyanamides, the C-N bond inside these compounds is of special interest in a number of fields with implication for low compressibility materials. In particular, polymerizing the CN 2 2-units could open a versatile access to three dimensional C/N networks. The research on phase transition and decomposition behavior of cyanamide using in situ high pressure techniques offers us an opportunity to study the intrinsic characteristics of C-N bonding and the decomposition dynamics of cyanamide under high pressure conditions.</p><p>The high pressure experiments were carried out at room temperature in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) apparatus, while the ruby fluorescence method was used for pressure calibration. The angle-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction experiments (wavelength 0.3738 Angstrom) in a DAC were performed for HgCN 2 , Ag 2 CN 2 , and Na 2 CN 2 at the beamline ID30. Diffraction patterns were recorded on an image plate and then converted to the intensity versus 2θ diffraction angle by using the program FIT2D.</p><p>From the XRD patterns of the HgCN 2 we can observe that additional diffraction peaks appear while the diffraction peaks of HgCN 2 keep stable at increasing pressure to 1.9 GPa. The new peaks can be indexed as α-Hg, this indicates the pressure induced decomposition of HgCN 2 to happen at about 1.9 GPa. However, the decomposition proceeds slowly, and does not finish even Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> as the pressure reaches 10 GPa. The product of decomposition should consist of mercury and C-N remnants. The possibility of some of C-N double bonds converting to single bonds and then forming a C-N single bond network under high pressure is the interesting point to check. However, only mercury could be observed in the diffraction patterns. The C-N remnants may have formed an amorphous network which has neither XRD peaks nor obviously new Raman active modes, the latter were measured in MPI für Festkörperforschung in <ref type="bibr">Stuttgart[4]</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a typical Rietveld refinement result (using the program GSAS) of the powder pattern at 5.1 GPa at compression. At this condition two phases (HgCN 2 and α-Hg) coexist. In the pressure range of 7.0 GPa to 10 GPa, α-Hg (rhombohedral, R -3m) partly transforms to β-Hg (tetragonal, I4/mmm). This phase transition should happen at 3.7 GPa for pure mercury. The delay of this phase transition may be attributed to small amounts of impurities of carbon and nitrogen resulting from the decomposition. Neglecting the decomposition, the equation of state for mercury cyanamide could be fitted according to second order (K 0 ' = 4) Birch equation. The zero pressure bulk modulus (K 0 ), estimated as 38.5 GPa, indicates mercury cyanamide to be a very soft compound.</p><p>H 2 CN 2 is a weak acid and for the metal cyanamides low stability is expected. However, Ag 2 CN 2 shows, surprisingly, very stable under pressure within 10 GPa, and its zero pressure bulk modulus was estimated as 102 GPa if setting K 0 ' as 4 (Birch equation of state). On the other hand, Na 2 CN 2 was observed a phase transition happen at very low pressure, and the phase analysis is still in progress. In this case no pressure medium was used due to Na 2 CN 2 is very sensitive to moisture. Every compound of the cyanamide family shows special kind of behavior under high pressure maybe due to its intrinsic instability. Further investigations will give us new insight into the different grade and reason of stability, and may lead into new access to amorphous C/N networks.</p></div>
