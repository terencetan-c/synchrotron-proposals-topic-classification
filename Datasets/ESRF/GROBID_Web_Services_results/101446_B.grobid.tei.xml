<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment ES-1225 has been performed in two phases: the first one, from 11/10/2022 to 12/10/2022 and the second from 2/11/2022 to 4/11/2022 for a total of 9 shifts. The present report refers to the second session, although they were strictly linked together. The object of the experiment is a small dinosaur, one of the smallest of Europe, encased into a sandstone block.</p><p>The second session of the experiment aimed to investigate inner anatomical structure of key ROIs located in the previous session. The region we investigated are: (1) femoral shaft, (2) jaw internal anatomy and (3) dental thin sections. The ROI (1) aimed to produce histological thin sections to look for rates of growth, the ROI (2) to examine replacement rates of teeth and ROI (3) rates of amelogenesis. Despite the complex acquisition we managed to assemble a very comprehensive dataset, which is currently under examination by our team. The thin sections of the femoral shaft evidenced the presence of spongy bones inside the femur, as expected in very young individuals. Maxillary and dentary teeth thin sections highlight patterns that are currently being examinated. The potential of this dataset it is great and our team aim to produce a high impact paper from its elaboration.</p><p>Hereafter we show some preliminary results of the ongoing elaboration process: </p></div>			</div>
