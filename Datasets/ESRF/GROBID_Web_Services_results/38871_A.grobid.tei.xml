<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Spore development begins with an asymmetric cell division that produces two dissimilar daughter cells. The smaller cell (forespore) differentiates into the spore while the large cell (mother cell) becomes a terminally differentiated cell that nurtures the developing forespore. During development the mother cell engulfs the prespore to produce a free protoplast within the mother cell cytoplasm surrounded by two bilayer membranes and isolated from the external medium [1,2, and references therein]. Activation of the late forespore-specific RNA polymerase sigma factor, σ G , coincides with completion of engulfment and further requires the action of the conserved membrane protein insertase SpoIIIJ, and the expression of the spoIIIA operon in the mother cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Recently was proposed a model in which the spoIIIA-encoded proteins may form a synapse-like signaling complex, that following engulfment completion conveys a signal to the forespore that antagonizes the putative inhibitor of σ G , there by releasing its activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Because some of the spoIIIA-encoded proteins show sequence similarity to ion permeases, we decided to monitor differential spoIIIA-dependent ion accumulation between the forespore and the mother cell.</p><p>We used fixed cells from wild type B. subtilis and from the congenic spoIIIA and sigG mutants collected just after completion of the engulfment process. The measurements were performed under vaccum in order to detect the light elements, the exciting energy was 7.2 keV and the energy flux was 3.8×10 9 ph/s at 163 mA. Before the synchrotron measurements were conducted, the cells were extensively washed with water to remove any salts from their surface. This step proved to be critical in avoiding a background signal from the buffers used during fixation. The cells were next observed by X-ray microscopy in phase contrast and fluorescence mode. A global fluorescence spectrum collected for each sample have shown the presence of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Mn and Fe in the samples. Interesting the mutant cells were found to accumulate more iron then the wild type cells. We then used phase-contrast X-ray image and the 2D elemental mapping analysis to localize the iron accumulation inside the cell. The results indicated that, and as expected from increased accumulation in the forespore compartment, the intensity of the signal increased close to the cell poles. This is the first clue ever for SpoIIIA-dependent substrate. However, this observation need to be further investigated. In any event, due to the chamber properties on ID21 beamline there is a low contrast for the iron signal, most likely due to the iron scattering inside of the chamber. Therefore for future work it may be necessary to perform those studies on a different station (ID22 or ID22N).</p><p>In an extension of these results, we have also looked at the accumulation of metals in intact spores.</p><p>Bacterial spores are an extremely resistant resting cell type, in part because of their high degree of mineralization. We obtained fluorescence spectra, phase-contrast X-ray image and the 2D elemental mapping analysis from wild type purified spores. The results show that Ca 2+ , Mn 2+ and K + are the main elements that accumulate in spores to high levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In conclusion, the results obtained using the ID21 X-Ray Microscopy beamline revealed some features concerning the localization of manganese, iron, calcium and potassium on wild type B. subtilis cells and from the congenic spoIIIA and sigG mutants and also in spores. More experiments need to be performed to study of mutants involved in the accumulation of these elements in the spore. These studies will be of the uttermost importance, as they will allow the identification of the main determinants of spore heat resistant.</p><p>They will also have the additional motivation of defining strategies for the rapid identification of spores at the species levels (e.g., spores of pathogenic organisms in samples from patients, hospital settings or the environment), as well as establishing novel methods for spore inactivation.</p></div>
