<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The crystallographic symmetry of antiferromagnetic CoO was studied using high-resolution synchrotron powder diffraction in the temperature range 10 -300 K. The high-quality powder patterns unambiguously revealed a monoclinic symmetry (space group C2/m) and allowed the extraction of accurate values for the lattice constants. The temperature dependence of the monoclinic deformation scales with the much stronger tetragonal distortion as determined from laboratory x-ray diffraction. Magnetic ordering is associated with a cubic-to-monoclinic transition which is thus of first-order type. Neutron powder diffraction data are compatible with a collinear magnetic structure with the moments ordered in the monoclinic ac-plane.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The high-resolution powder diffractometer on BM1B (Swiss-Norwegian beam-line) at ESRF was used with = 0.50084 ⇒ in a further effort to clarify the true symmetry of CoO. The sample was filled in a 0.5 mm diameter capillary. Complete powder patterns with a 2 range between 1 and 62° were collected at 10 and 293 K. The sample was cooled by means of a liquid helium cryostat with a temperature stability of ±0.1 K. At the temperatures between 30 to 200 K only partial patterns were recorded. Further data between 150 and 300 K were collected on BM16 with = 0.40578 ⇒ using a cryostream nitrogen cooling system with a poorer stability of ±5 K. The presence of a monoclinic lattice is clearly manifested by a splitting of the reflections. Rietveld refinements on each powder pattern were performed making use of FULLPROF.9 All peaks were indexed in the space group C2/m with Co at position 2a(0, 0, 0) and O at 2d(0, 2 1 , 2 1 ). Additional peaks revealed that the impurity Co3O4 was still present at a concentration of 5%, and it was included in joint refinements. The monoclinic angle may be written as 125.2644° + /, with / referring to the deviation from orthogonality of the conventional facecentered cell. It is apparent that the temperature dependence of the monoclinic deformation scales with the much stronger tetragonal distortion. The antiferromagnetic transition is thus accompanied by a cubicto-monoclinic crystallographic distortion. At 293 K, the lattice constant of the cubic phase is a = 4.26077(2) ⇒. At 10 K, the monoclinic lattice constants are: a = 5.18190( <ref type="formula">6</ref>), b = 3.01761(3), c = 3.01860(3) ⇒, 125.5792(9)°. In the face-centered setting, this corresponds to an angle of 89.962° between the two edges of different length.</p><p>Futher details can be found in the publication : Jauch W., Reehuis M., Bleif H.
