<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>5 orthorhombic phase lattice as reference. The results indicate a disordered 2D network where the nearest oxygen atoms are distributed on two doubly degenerate shells. The second neighbors shell is made by a single vanadium atom in the adjacent cell. The axial V=O bond is not revealed by EXAFS supporting the bi-dimensional character of this phase. Results for this 2D phase are summarized and reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> (from which is possible to underline a short range order in the equatorial plane for this network) and in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Table1. Arthemis palettes from our best fit for this 2D phase. The other phase is characterized by a nearly 3D network, with both planar and axial order. The bond lengths are slightly different from those of orthorhombic V 2 O 5 suggesting an intermediate phase between an hydrated V 2 O 5 ⋅nH 2 O phase (2D) and the orthorhombic phase (3D).</p><p>Table 2. Arthemis palettes from our best fit for this phase. This work has been reported in the Poster Session of SAMIC 2005, held in Bressanone (Brixen), Italy, 4 th -7 th of September, 2005. It will be presented in summary at the First International Conference on Nano-Structures Self-Assembling (NanoSEA), that will be held in Aix-en Provence, France, 2 nd -6 th of July, 2006. A detailed report on this run of experiment will be presented at the European Conference on X-Ray Spectrometry (EXRS 2006), that will be hosted in Paris, France, 19 th -23 rd of June, 2006.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
