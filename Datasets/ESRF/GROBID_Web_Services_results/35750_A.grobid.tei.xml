<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Arthropod hemocyanins (Hcs) are a family of large, high molecular mass, extracellular oxygen transport proteins. They form oligomeric quaternary structures based on different arrangements of a basic 6 Â 75 kDa hexameric unit. Their complex quaternary structures present binding sites for allosteric effectors and regulate the oxygen binding process in a cooperative manner. In order to describe the functional regulation of arthropod Hcs, a detailed description of their quaternary structure is necessary. We have utilized small angle X-ray scattering to characterize the structure of three arthropod Hcs in unperturbed conditions. Two different levels of complexity are evaluated: for the 2 Â 6-meric case, we analyzed the Hcs of the portunid crab Carcinus aestuarii and stomatopod Squilla mantis, while in the case of 4 Â 6-meric structures, we studied the Hc of the thalassinid shrimp Upogebia pusilla. While C. aestuarii Hc presented a structure comparable to other 2 Â 6-meric crustacean Hcs, S. mantis Hc shows a peculiar and quite unique arrangement of its building blocks, resembling a substructure of giant Hcs found among cheliceratans. For U. pusilla, the arrangement of its subunits is described as tetrahedral, in contrast to the more common square planar 4 Â 6-meric structure found in other arthropod Hcs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The biological role of Hemocyanins (Hcs), a family of oxygen transport proteins present in the hemolymph of most arthropods and molluscs, is based on the reversible binding of molecular oxygen to a binuclear copper active site <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Markl and Decker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Salvato and Beltramini, 1990)</ref>. These proteins are characterized by a complex quaternary structure that provides the structural basis for the onset of the allosteric behavior exhibited by the oligomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(van Heel and Dube, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>In arthropods, the reference structures are hexameric proteins (1 Â 6-mer) isolated from the lobster Panulirus interruptus and the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus (subunit II). Such structures have been solved by crystallographic methods allowing for a precise definition of the inter-subunits interactions within the hexamer <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Volbeda and Hol, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hazes et al., 1993)</ref>. Hc hexamers are organized as a two-layer aggregate where each layer includes three subunits, shifted 30°with respect to each other. A threefold symmetry axis connects the subunits along the axial position of the molecule, whereas three twofold symmetry axes, running perpendicular to the threefold axis, connect the subunits belonging to different layers (D 3 point-group symmetry). Arthropod Hcs subunits are made by a polypeptide chain folded as to form a three-domain structure of $75 kDa.</p><p>The active site, formed by domain two, is deeply buried in the protein matrix where six histidine residues, belonging to a four antiparallel a-helical motif, represent the ligands for two copper ions that are fundamental for dioxygen binding. The availability of several subunits sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burmester, 2002)</ref>, of crystallographic structure of two deoxy-Hcs (P. interruptus a and b subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Volbeda and Hol, 1989)</ref>, L. polyphemus subunit II <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hazes et al., 1993)</ref>), one oxy-Hc (L. polyphemus subunit II <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Magnus et al., 1994)</ref>) and of the homolog prophenoloxidase from Manduca sexta <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Li et al., 2009)</ref>, have provided important hints to address some fundamental questions on Hc molecular physiology such as the structural basis for the oligomerization and the structural changes occurring upon binding of dioxygen.</p><p>Hcs are widely distributed within arthropods and there is not a unique quaternary structure within the taxon. In addition to the 1 Â 6-mer, the oligomerization state of the arthropod Hcs includes 2 Â 6, 4 Â 6, 6 Â 6 and 8 Â 6-meric depending on the species <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Markl and Decker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Salvato and Beltramini, 1990)</ref>. The molecular complexity increases, due to the increase of heterogeneity in subunit composition of the aggregates, where specific subunits play a key role in the quaternary structure organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Voit et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bruneaux et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kusche et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Decker et al., 1989)</ref>. In most cases we are currently not able to predictively describe the oligomeric assembly starting from basic hexameric units.</p><p>Several studies aimed at a thorough description of the hierarchical aggregation of such giant molecules exploited non-crystallographic approaches such as conventional electron microscopy (EM) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and small angle X-ray scattering <ref type="bibr">(SAXS)</ref>. With these approaches, the quaternary structures of the 1 Â 6-meric Hc from lobsters Palinurus elephas (by cryo-EM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Meissner et al., 2003)</ref> and Homarus americanus (by SAXS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hartmann et al., 2001)</ref>, horseshoe crab L. polyphemus, centipede Scutigera coleoptrata and scorpion Pandinus imperator (by cryo-EM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taveau et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Martin and et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Markl et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cong and et al., 2009)</ref> and the tarantula Eurypelma californicum (by SAXS and EM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hartmann and Decker, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Decker et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Haas and van Bruggen, 1994)</ref> have been solved to a resolution as good as $20-30 Å in case of SAXS and $7 Å in case of cryo-EM.</p><p>In this paper we have studied by SAXS the quaternary organization of three Hcs characterized by two levels of complexity: the 2 Â 6-meric and the 4 Â 6-meric. In the former case, two proteins have been considered: the Hc of the portunid crab Carcinus aestuarii and that of the stomatopod Squilla mantis. Based on previous EM studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Markl and Decker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bijlholt and van Bruggen, 1986)</ref> they differ in the quaternary organization and our intention was to characterize by SAXS their structures at a higher resolution. In particular, since previous EM studies proposed two possible models for S. mantis Hc we have used SAXS to verify and validate them. As far as the 4 Â 6-meric level of organization is concerned, we present here the description of the Hc isolated from the thalassinid shrimp Upogebia pusilla. Based on a conventional EM study, thalassinid 4 Â 6-meric Hcs have a quaternary structure completely different from the aggregation state exhibited by 4 Â 6-meric cheliceratan Hcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cavellec et al., 1989)</ref>. In this particular case we have described the structure of the oligomer and its symmetry.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Protein purification</head><p>The Hcs of the present study were purified from the hemolymph of living specimens by standard procedures: <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bubacco et al., 1992)</ref> for C. aestuarii and S. mantis Hc and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Paoli et al., 2007)</ref> for U. pusilla Hc. The proteins were purified to high concentrations (&gt;25 g l À1 ) in 50 mM Tris/HCl, 20 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.6 and stored with 20% sucrose as a cryoprotectant at À20 °C. The Hc concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficients e 280 = 1.21 ml mg À1 cm À1 for C. aestuarii and S. mantis Hc or e 280 = 1.11 ml mg À1 cm À1 for U. pusilla Hc. The quality of Hc preparations was checked from the absorbance ratio A 337 /A 278 assuming a value 0.21 or better for a solution of fully oxygenated protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Sample preparation and SAXS measurements</head><p>Prior to SAXS measurements, sucrose was eliminated from native protein stocks by an overnight dialysis against 50 mM Tris/ HCl, 20 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.6. Homogeneous solutions of the oligomers under study were obtained by eluting the whole Hc solutions in size exclusion chromatography on a Pharmacia FPLC system (SEC-FPLC) using a prep-grade Hi-Load Superdex 200 26/ 60 column or a Sephacryl S-300 XK 26/60 column (Pharmacia). The higher retention time material corresponding to the 2 Â 6meric (in the case of C. aestuarii and S. mantis Hc) or 4 Â 6-meric (in the case of U. pusilla Hc) fraction was collected and concentrated. The stability of each oligomer was checked by a second chromatography of the pooled material. All protein samples were fully oxygenated and diluted in the above buffer to the final concentration of 4 g l À1 .</p><p>Small angle scattering measurements were performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Measurements were carried out under standard experimental setup at the public beamline ID2 (high brilliance). The wavelength of the monochromatic Dk/k = 10 À4 X-ray beam was 0.995 Å (at E = 12.4 keV). The scattering pattern was recorded on 2D, ESRF developed FReLoN CCD camera coupled to a Thomson X-ray image intensifier (XRII) at the resolution of 1024 Â 1024 (binned mode) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Narayanan et al., 2001)</ref>. The sample-detector distance was set to 2 m giving a scattering vector q in the range 0.04-2.31 nm À1 where q = 4p sin(h)/k and 2k is the scattering angle. Several protein concentrations were tried in order to minimize interparticle interactions and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. At the used concentration of 4 g l À1 , no particle interactions were observed. The samples were measured in quartz capillaries (diameter 1 mm) at room temperature. Data reduction was performed using in-house programs and involved flux, detector response, exposure time and sample transmission normalization. Multiple 0.5 s exposures of protein samples with relative buffers were averaged and subsequently subtracted. Experimental curves at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were superimposable with used exposure times so no radiation damage effects could be observed.</p></div>

During the modeling process, a 3.2 Å crystal structure of deoxy-hexameric Panulirus interruptus Hc (Protein Data Bank accession number 1HCY) was used since it represents the only crustacean Hc structure known at high resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Volbeda and Hol, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Ab initio structures of oligomeric proteins were modeled with the use of SASREF, a rigid body multi-subunit modeling program <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Electron microscopy and image analysis</head><p>Samples were prepared as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ohi et al. (2004)</ref>. A 5 ll drop of sample solution was adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid, washed with two drops of deionized water, and stained with two drops of freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl acetate. Samples were imaged at room temperature using a Fei Tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with a LaB 6 filament and operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Images were taken at a calibrated magnification of 36,000Â. Hc particles were manually picked from electron micrographs with the module Boxer of the EMAN software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ludtke et al., 1999)</ref>. A total of 370 particles were selected in 128 Â 128 boxes with a pixel size of 3.65 Å. The following particle analysis was carried out with SPIDER image processing package <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Frank et al., 1996)</ref>. Selected particles were band-pass filtered at 25 and 250 Å, normalized for intensity and circularly masked with a Gaussian falloff function. Multi-reference alignment of the particles was done against low-pass filtered volume projections of pro-tein models obtained from SAXS data. Cross correlation was used as a similarity measure between boxed particles and simulated 2D projections of SAXS derived models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>The 1 Â 6-meric is the only quaternary structure of arthropod Hc known at crystallographic resolution. This limitation imposes a strategy to build up starting models, which involves the use of crystallographic coordinates for hexamer modeling and information on inter-hexameric arrangement based on available noncrystallographic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hartmann and Decker, 2004)</ref>. Thus, 2 Â 6-meric structures were generated by the arrangement of two P. interruptus hexamers. Moving the hexameric building blocks according to different strategies and minimizing the discrepancies between the experimental and modeled SAXS curve refined these initial models. Experimental SAXS patterns of different Hcs are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">C</ref>, and E and compared with curves resulting from different models. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref> and <ref type="figure">F</ref> shows the corresponding p(r) functions calculated from SAXS data. For each modeled case, the experimental SAXS data and the corresponding p(r) functions are reported for every fit in order to bet- ter visualize the correspondence between experimental and model-based theoretical curves. Reduced residual plots of all fits are shown in Supplementary Fig 1.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = χ 2 = A B C D E F</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">C. aestuarii hemocyanin modeling</head><p>Measured SAXS pattern of C. aestuarii Hc is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and B and the obtained invariants radius of gyration (R g ) and maximum particle length (D max ) are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. R g and D max are 72 ± 1 and 225 ± 5 Å, respectively, in very good agreement with those reported for the 2 Â 6-meric Hc from H. americanus (72.1 ± 0.05 and 235 Å, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hartmann et al., 2001)</ref>. The molecular mass determined from the forward scattering intensity is in agreement with the 2 Â 6-meric state of this Hc species (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>SAXS refinement of a structural model derived by negativestain EM was successfully applied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hartmann et al. (2001)</ref> in the case of H. americanus. Therefore we have used a similar approach using as starting models two structures for decapod 2 Â 6-meric Hcs available in literature. The first one is the Hc of C. pagurus described by De <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Haas et al. (1991)</ref> from negative-stain EM images and successively refined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hartmann et al. (2001)</ref>. The second one is represented by E. californicum Hc. This Hc in native state is a 4 Â 6-mer, formed by two-staggered 2 Â 6-mers that have been described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hartmann and Decker (2002)</ref> using SAXS. CRYSOL program was used to calculate the scattering curve from the models and compare them to the experimental curve giving v 2 values of 10.3 and 12.6. The comparison of experimental SAXS curve of C. aestuarii Hc with the curves generated from the two available models is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>.</p><p>In order to obtain the best representation of C. aestuarii Hc structure, we have used both available 2 Â 6-meric structures as starting models (called a and b) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). For the first starting model, a P. interruptus hexameric structure was oriented so that its threefold symmetry axis coincides with the z-axis pointing to the observer while the x-axis coincides with one of the twofold axes as described by De Haas and van <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bruggen (1994)</ref>. In order to accommodate the second hexamer, the hexamer with the orientation described above was shifted by a vector (À117.5, À0.05, 0.00) and held fixed during the fitting procedure (lower hexamer). The position of the upper hexamer was obtained from 30 runs of SAS-REF program. Initially, a coarse 5 Å translational and 20°angular step size was used. The structures obtained were clustered according to the v 2 value and the positional vector of the upper hexamer.</p><p>In this way it was possible to choose a typical, most representative best-fit structure. Such structure was used as a starting point for another 30 runs of SASREF, this time with much finer sampling steps (1 Å translational and 5 degrees rotational step). By this procedure we have adjusted the position of the two hexamers and obtained a model that gives the lowest v 2 value. Both initial models, a and b, converged to the same final model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, with the v 2 value of 5.8. Its scattering curve compared to the experimental one shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and the corresponding pair distribution function calculated from the atomic model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>. Reduced residuals for both functions are shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>. Model scattering curve is consistent with the experimental one with deviations around a first minimum and at high angles. Increased minimum in the modeled structure is an indication of a more spherical structure while deviations at high angles (bringing high-resolution information) are attributed to the use of a non-native hexameric structural unit for modeling purposes. Calculated p(r) function follows closely the experimental one with deviations around 150 Å showing increased inter-hexameric distances with respect to experimental data and therefore resulting in a slightly more compact model. However, increasing the inter-hexameric distance in the final model was not enough to further improve the presented model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports Euler angles and translational vector of the representative, best-fit model.</p></div>

The two models differ for the mutual rotation of the stacked hexamers; in model I, the hexamers are in contact through one subunit while in model III two subunits from each hexamer are involved in contact as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. As in the case for C. aestuarii, P. interruptus structure was used for modeling purposes. The comparisons of calculated and experimental scattering curves are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>.</p><p>The EM-based models (models I and III) give remarkably high v 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, curves a and b, with v 2 of 26.1 and 21.6, respectively).</p><p>To improve the model, the position of the upper hexamer was optimized to the SAXS pattern by performing a full 3D translational search procedure. At every step of a procedure, the upper hexamer was shifted ±60 Å in all directions at steps of 6 Å creating C a atom models for both model I and model III. Successively, CRYSOL program was used to calculate the scattering curves from the models and compare them to the experimental one. From such best-fit structures, another round of 3D search procedure with step size of 1 Å using all-atom models was executed. Both starting models converged to the same optimized model lowering the v 2 to 13.4.</p><p>To further improve the S. mantis Hc structural model, it was necessary to enable the free rotation of the upper hexamer. Therefore, as a second step, a 6-parameter rigid body modeling of S. mantis Hc was accomplished with 30 runs of SASREF program with coarse translational and rotational step sizes (1 Å and 5°) followed by another 30 rounds with finer parameter space sampling (0.5 Å and 2°). A representative best-fit structure is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref> with corresponding fits and pair distribution functions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref>, <ref type="figure">curve d</ref>). In this way it was possible to decrease slightly the v 2 value to 11.5.</p><p>Upon inspection of the modeled structure of S. mantis Hc, we have found that it resembles closely a substructure of larger cheliceratan 4 Â 6-meric and 8 Â 6-meric Hcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Martin and et al., 2007</ref>;    Cong <ref type="bibr">and et al., 2009)</ref>. Namely, in 4 Â 6-meric and higher Hcs, two hexamers tightly assemble to form a 2 Â 6-mer (called a dodecamer). Two identical dodecamers further dimerize in an antiparallel orientation producing a 4 Â 6-meric Hc. S. mantis Hc bears a resemblance to a cheliceratan 2 Â 6-meric obtained from two hexamers belonging each to a separate dodecamer. This lead to the generation of another starting model, utilizing the electron density map of resting state P. imperator Hc <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cong and et al., 2009)</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). Calculated SAXS pattern showed large differences with respect to the experimental S. mantis pattern giving a v 2 value of 31.5. After two rounds of SASREF rigid body modeling with final step sizes of 0.5 Å and 2°, it was possible to obtain a better model for S. mantis Hc than starting from previously described EM-based models (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> reports Euler angles and translational vector of this final best-fit model.</p></div>

The I(0) intensity, and therefore molecular mass, invariant with respect to the shape of the particle, is roughly twice as large as both C. aestuarii and S. mantis. The R g and D max are in agreement with a different structure for U. pusilla with respect to cheliceratan Hcs. The 4 Â 6-meric structure of thalassinid Hcs is peculiar among Arthropod Hcs since it shows a roughly tetrahedral packing of the four hexameric building blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Markl and Decker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cavellec et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Paoli et al., 2007)</ref>, in contrast to a square planar arrangement of E. californicum and P. imperator 4 Â 6-meric and L. polyphemus half molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(van Heel and Dube, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Taveau et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Martin and et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cong and et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Decker et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Haas and van Bruggen, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">De Haas et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bijlholt et al., 1982)</ref>. The tetrahedral arrangement of hexameric building blocks results in a more compact structure characterized by a smaller R g (84 ± 1 for U. pusilla against 88.0 ± 0.5 Å for E. californicum) and D max (241 ± 5 for U. pusilla against 270 Å for E. californicum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hartmann and Decker, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, from published EM-derived data, it is unknown if the four hexamers in U. pusilla Hc are arranged in a symmetrical or asymmetric manner. With that restriction in mind, we have modeled U. pusilla Hc assuming it to be a completely asymmetrical particle (C 1 ) or having D 2 symmetry. The modeling involved calculation of ab initio structures with SASREF program by imposing a P1 or P222 symmetry. A total of 40 and 30 runs of SASREF were executed in the case of symmetrical and asymmetrical particles, using 5 Å translational and 20°rotational step sizes. The asymmetrical models produced by SASREF were heterogeneous in subunit rotations while their reciprocal positions were more consistent. On the other hand, D 2 models converged to three structural solutions with similar v 2 values (7.3-8.4). Representative structures of the three, symmetry imposed, structural solutions are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-C</ref> with corresponding fits and pair distribution functions in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> and <ref type="figure">F</ref>. The discrepancies between modeled and measured p(r) functions for the three models show consistently an increase of the experimental curve around 75 Å and a decrease around 150 Å (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As in the case of C. aestuarii Hc model, the three U. pusilla models are therefore slightly more compact than the native protein. The p(r) region from 50 to 100 Å is determined by the shape of the P. interruptus hexamer used for modeling which proves to be less adequate to represent U. pusilla Hc while being acceptable for C. aestuarii and S. mantis Hcs.</p><p>All 40 symmetrical and 30 asymmetrical models produced by the two fitting procedures were structurally aligned and averaged with the DAMAVER program. The resulting two average Hc structures were compared using the SUPCOMB spatial alignment program (from the DAMAVER suite), which gave a normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) value of 0.63. NSD value is a quantitative estimate of structural similarity between two aligned objects. When this value is smaller than one, the two objects can be considered equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kozin and Svergun, 2001)</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref> shows the superposition of the averaged symmetrical and asymmetrical model showing their common overall shape.</p><p>In order to distinguish which one of the three symmetrical U. pusilla Hc models represents the actual protein structure, we have compared EM images of negatively stained proteins with SAXS derived models. SAXS models were converted to low-pass filtered volume densities and their 2D projections were calculated from 190 quasi-uniformly distributed orientations within the asymmetric triangle. A total 370 Hc particles extracted from EM micrographs were individually aligned to 570 projections of SAXS models. In this way 48.1% of EM particle images aligned to projections of SAXS model 2, 26.8% aligned to model 1 and 25.1% to model 3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In this work we have used small angle X-ray scattering technique to characterize the structures of three arthropod Hcs in solution, presenting different levels of quaternary structure complexity. The use of this method in structural biology is encouraged due to the additional information obtainable from measurements in native-like solutions that can be hidden to EM and high-resolution crystallographic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Corbett et al., 2007)</ref>. The first structure analyzed, the 2 Â 6-meric Hc from C. aestuarii, was the easiest model to study since it shares the oligomeric structure with other crustacean Hcs whose structure has been thoroughly described: the crab C. pagurus <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(De Haas et al., 1991)</ref> and the lobster H. americanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hartmann et al., 2001)</ref>. The analysis of C. aestuarii Hc SAXS data was important as a test set and development of modeling strategies used with the other two explored structures: the peculiar, stacked 2 Â 6-meric Hc from the stomatopod S. mantis and the tetrahedral 4 Â 6-meric structure from the thalassinid shrimp U. pusilla. The structures of these two unusual Hcs types are only partially described up to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bijlholt and van Bruggen, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cavellec et al., 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Arthropod Hcs are composed of heterogeneous subunits and, out of the three investigated Hc species, only one subunit has been sequenced (C. aestuarii gamma-type subunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dolashka-Angelova and et al., 2005)</ref>. Nevertheless arthropod Hcs share a high degree of sequence similarity ranging from 30% to 70% implying a conserved tertiary structure, which is easily observed from EM analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Markl and Decker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burmester, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Linzen and et al., 1985)</ref>. This assumption was the basis for the use of the crystal structure of a different Hc to model all three crustacean Hcs, as previously done by other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hartmann et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hartmann and Decker, 2002)</ref>. To validate the use of the available crystal structures as building blocks for Carcinus, Squilla and Upogebia Hcs, we have compared the calculated SAXS patterns from P. interruptus and cheliceratan L. polyphemus Hcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hazes et al., 1993)</ref> against the experimental curve of C. aestuarii pH-stable hexamer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dainese et al., 1998)</ref>. Such hexamer is the only C. aestuarii structure that can be purified and maintained in solution without further aggregation to 2 Â 6-mers. Sequence alignments show that higher identity exists between C. aestuarii versus P. interruptus (56%) as compared with C. aestuarii versus L. polyphemus (30%). In agreement, P. interruptus hexameric structure fitted significantly better the SAXS pattern of C. aestuarii pH-stable hexamer than the L. polyphemus structure (data not shown).</p><p>C. aestuarii dodecameric Hc obtained from solution scattering data showed a typical cheliceratan oligomeric structure, with the threefold axes of the two stacked hexamers almost perpendicular to each other, while one of the twofold axes of each hexamer run parallel to the long axis of the structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref> with stereo views in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The interfaces between the two hexameric building blocks are less symmetrical than published data and seem to involve two subunits from the lower hexamer and three subunits from the upper one. From the low-resolution SAXS reconstruction we can estimate that the interacting subunits are mostly in contact through their first and third domains. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>, the inter-hexameric distance and the tilt angle between the two hexamers are shown to better visualize the structure of the best-fit model.</p><p>The Hc structure from S. mantis shows a peculiar inter-hexameric subunit arrangement and so far it represents a unique structure shared among stomatopod crustacea. Typical crustacean and cheliceratan 2 Â 6-mers are arranged so that their hexameric building blocks are in contact through their short, rough sides. Instead stomatopod Hcs have their building blocks stacked on their long, flat sides as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>, compared to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Negative-stain electron microscopy analysis described roughly the mutual position and overlap of the two building blocks and two different models were proposed differing in the orientation of the upper hexamer (called models I and III <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bijlholt and van Bruggen, 1986)</ref>. In model I, one subunit from the lower hexamer interacts with one subunit from the upper one. Model III has both hexamers rotated by 60°showing two subunits from the lower hexamer in contact with two subunits from the upper one. Our best-fit SAXS model confirms the model III structure for S. mantis Hc although the upper hexamer had to be shifted by 13.6 Å closer to the lower one. Discrepancies of more than 1 nm in subunits positional placements between EM and solution scattering data have been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hartmann et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Decker et al., 1996)</ref> and are attributed to the use of negative staining. Besides simple translational optimization of the upper subunit, a full translational and rotational search was utilized to further increase the accuracy of the SAXS generated model. Comparing this solution structure of S. mantis Hc to all known 2 Â 6-meric Hc aggregates, a structural analog can be found in the half molecule of Hc from L. polyphemus and other Chelicerata that show a 4 Â 6-meric structure. Cheliceratan 4 Â 6-meric Hcs are composed by the dimerization of a 2 Â 6-mer (called dodecamer) in an antiparallel orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Martin and et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cong and et al., 2009)</ref>. This 2 Â 6-mer is highlighted in the P. imperator Hc structure shown in red and yellow colors in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>. However, another structurally different 2 Â 6-mer can be singled out taking into account adjacent hexamers from each dodecamer of the native 4 Â 6-mer. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>, the structure of this 2 Â 6-mer is highlighted in red and blue. This alternative 2 Â 6-mer presents high structural homology to S. mantis Hc besides the handedness since both enantiomers produce the same scattering pattern. The inter-hexameric distance in the modeled S. mantis Hc is much shorter than those found in cheliceratan 4 Â 6-meric ($103 Å versus 107-112 Å) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). That could be due to inter-hexameric contacts in S. mantis being the only, and therefore most important interface in the molecule. On the other hand, in cheliceratan structures the major interface is among the hexamers in the dodecamer, while interdodecameric contacts are mostly involved in conformational changes due to allosteric effectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cong and et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The final best-fit structure has the geometry similar as the EMderived model III, with two subunits in contact with other two from the lower hexamer. Mutual inter-hexameric orientation is not as symmetrical as model III suggested. As visualized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>, the two hexamers are not simply stacked one on the other and shifted by 66 Å but their threefold axes are rotated by 5°. As a consequence, the tilt of the upper hexamer produces asymmetrical inter-hexameric contacts among the four involved subunits.</p><p>As much as S. mantis Hc differs from all other 2 Â 6-meric Hcs, so does the U. pusilla among 4 Â 6-meric ones. Average low-resolution SAXS based models of U. pusilla were obtained assuming a symmetrical (D 2 ) and asymmetrical (C 1 ) arrangement of hexameric building blocks. The two structures showed an overall similar shape with comparable goodness of the fit values. Therefore, at this resolution, we have no evidence to prefer a more complex (asymmetrical) model as the correct one for the U. pusilla Hc. In order to increase the resolution of the structure, we have clustered and averaged all generated symmetrical models. The models converged to three distinct structural solutions but equivalent from the SAXS point of view. By comparing the structural solutions with negativestain EM micrographs of U. pusilla Hc we are able to discern the most probable structural model among the three proposed. Although negative-stain EM is typically limited to 20 Å resolution, the precision of positional information when utilizing a hybrid approach (EM and crystallographic techniques) is around 5 Å (van Heel and Dube, 1994), thus validating our method. Majority of boxed EM particles were most similar to the simulated two-dimensional projections of only one SAXS based structural model (model 2). In model 2, four hexameric building blocks are in contact with each other, each contributing mainly with only one subunit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref> with stereo views in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</p><p>As far as the precision of the generated models is concerned, some general considerations could be put forward. SAXS based rigid body modeling with utilized programs is a stochastic process and therefore can produce sub-optimal models. In order to obtain the most accurate reconstruction from analyzed proteins, two main precautions were taken: first, we have used different starting models where applicable (E. californicum and C. pagurus for C. aestuarii Hc and two negative-stain EM-derived models and P. imperator for S. mantis Hc). Initial C. aestuarii models were tried also on S. mantis and U. pusilla Hcs but produced incorrect results. Second, the minimization process was guided using large angular and spatial step sizes followed by smaller ones in order to effectively sample the parameter space. The finest step sizes utilized in the modeling process limit the resolution of the reconstructions and are 1 Å and 5°for C. aestuarii, 0.5 Å and 2°for S. mantis and 5 Å and 20°for U. pusilla models. We estimated the error of the final models in the following way: for every final model, we have constructed all neighboring structures in six-dimensional parameter space offset by the finest step size used in the reconstruction (in total 3 6 À 1 = 728 models). Successively, scattering curves of all 728 models were calculated and averaged. Standard deviation of the averaged scattering intensities was used as an approximation of model errors (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). It is clear that for small step sizes (&lt;1 Å/5°), neighboring models produce almost identical scattering patterns so a more realistic estimate of the actual resolution lies in the range of 1-5 Å for translational parameters and 5-20°f or angular parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Arthropod Hcs represent a structurally heterogeneous class of oxygen transport proteins whose presence (and absence) in various taxa is still poorly understood and fails to be predicted from evolutionary relationships and animal behavior alone. In order to gain insight into this complex group of proteins, two approaches are currently ongoing. On one hand, the subunit heterogeneity of Hc is investigated at biochemical and molecular level starting with subunit identification and separation (with immunological and biophysical methods) and ending with complete sequencing of all subunit types present in native proteins. On the other hand, a structural approach, mainly coming form X-ray solution scattering and (cryo-)EM data analysis, gave insight into a native-like oligomeric assembly followed by higher resolution analyses showing conformational changes and functional modulation of these giant proteins.</p><p>In order to increase the structural coverage of known oligomeric states of arthropod Hcs, we have determined the solution structures of two unusual Hc oligomers, a 2 Â 6-meric one from S. mantis and a 4 Â 6-meric one from U. pusilla. In addition, a 2 Â 6-meric Hc from C. aestuarii was determined as a representative, characteristic structure. With the term unusual we intend a quaternary structure found in an isolated, small clade and showing no structural homologs among other arthropod taxa. Small angle X-ray scattering allowed us to describe the low-resolution structure of U. pusilla Hc with its symmetrical, tetrahedral subunit arrangement as compared to the more common square planar structure found within Chelicerata. The reconstructed structure of 2 Â 6-meric S. mantis Hc showed a subunit arrangement that resembles a substructure found in cheliceratan 4 Â 6-meric and 8 Â 6-meric Hcs. Higher resolution structures and sequencing information are needed to clarify if it is the case of structural convergence or homology.</p><p>Small angle scattering has proven as an excellent tool in structural biology, although at low resolution, but with the possibility of operation in unperturbed, native-like conditions. This method can complement quite well high-resolution electron microscopy, with the ability to improve on some EM-derived models, and on the other hand, utilize image analysis to discriminate and validate ambiguous solutions. It is becoming clear that structural data alone are insufficient to fully understand the relationships and distributions of Hc structures within Arthropods. The integration of full subunit sequences together with the mapping of various subunit types to low or medium resolution native structures are the key to thoroughly describe the structure-function relationships in this vast group of giant oxygen carriers.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
