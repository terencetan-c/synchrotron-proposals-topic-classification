<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Melting of MgO to P~50 Gpa by in situ diffraction and CO 2 laser-heating DAC studies </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this investigation was to study the melting point of MgO up to pressures ~ 50 GPa and beyond by conducting laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) experiments using CO 2 laser heating combined with time resolved synchrotron x-ray diffraction. The CO 2 laser-heating system for in situ LH-DAC/XRD experiments was only recently installed at ID27, and this is the only beamline currently available to perform this type of experiment worldwide.</p><p>MgO is a major component of the Earth's lower mantle and knowledge of its melting properties at high pressure (P) and high temperature (T) is fundamental for evaluating phase relations and mantle rheology. It is also an important refractory ceramic and determination of its high-P,T properties is essential for understanding its behaviour as a structural material in environments combining high mechanical stress and high T conditions. The melting point of MgO at ambient P is T m = 3125 K. Ab initio simulations predict that this should rise to T m ~6000 K by 50 GPa (dash line in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). However, in the one previous experiment carried out to date using the CO 2 LH-DAC technique combined with monitoring the T vs laser power curve to indicate the onset of melting, T m only achieved &lt;4000 K by 35 GPa and is extrapolated to rise only little above that by 50 GPa (circles and solid line in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). That represents a serious discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results, of &gt;2000 K by 50 GPa. Such a discrepancy must be resolved in order to understand the high-P,T properties of this important mantle mineral and refractory ceramic material. We proposed to study this using synchrotron XRD as a diagnostic of melting from the first appearance of liquid S(Q) and disappearance of crystalline Bragg peaks in the pattern, under LH conditions in the DAC. The IR radiation used to heat the sample was supplied by a CO 2 laser (λ ~ 10.6 µm) in order to couple directly with phonon modes of the sample. As an optically transparent insulating material it does not directly absorb near-IR radiation supplied by the Nd 3+ :YAG or YLF lasers in common use for LH-DAC experiments. This run was meant to be one of the first trials using the CO 2 LH-DAC system installed at ID27 for on-line experiments.</p><p>We initially requested 15 beamtime shifts to attempt these challenging and pioneering experiments. However, the allocation committee assigned us only 9 shifts. Since this was an experiment using a new experimental setup we were informed by the beamline scientist and team that our run would be scheduled at the beginning of a cycle dedicated to trialling the new CO 2 laser heating system. However when we arrived, we discovered that the previous user group had mistakenly requested CO 2 in their project proposal, when in fact they required Nd 3+ :YAG/YLF heating lasers. That meant the local contact had to break down the CO 2 LH system to re-install the near-IR laser optics for their run. The result is that we lost a further 9 hours of crucial beamtime, as we had to re-install and re-align the CO 2 LH optics, that are quite different to the near-IR system. We noted in our user evaluation form for the run that the beamtime allocation committee as well as prospective users should pay sufficient attention to the laser system that is actually required for a given experiment.</p><p>Despite these setbacks we managed to obtain some data. We successfully heated several samples in the 3000-3750 K temperature range, but did not observe melting (vertical dotted lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. represent P,T paths followed in some of our LH experiments). This apparently negative result may indicate that the previous Zerr and Boehler (ZB) determinations are likely too low, however, within experimental error we could be below the ZB melt line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The promising aspect of these initial data is that we do not see the usual signs for the onset of melting in this region such as a decrease in intensity of the MgO peaks and/or rapid recrystalisation. In our new proposal we now request additional beamtime to continue these experiments and obtain new melting data on MgO up to and perhaps above 50 GPa.</p><p>During our initial runs we also gained valuable information on the sample and pressurisation environment that will feed into our new proposal. A critical component of LH-DAC experiments is the ability to thermally insulate the sample from the diamond anvils. This became a problem during our runs since all of the common pressure-transmitting media (KBr, LiF, NaCl, Ar etc) melt well below the ambient P melting point of MgO. We tried initial runs using LiF and KBr. The LiF melted and caused substantial motion of the MgO sample within the DAC chamber. However, the KBr was acceptable: although it exhibited partial melting, the sample migration was not substantial and we could obtain XRD patterns throughout the LH-DAC experiment. Nonetheless, because KBr contains high-Z elements any peak overlap could obscure the signal from MgO. In our future experiments we will select specific pressures where no peak overlap should occur for the wavelength used. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>*</head><figDesc>Institute of Shock Physics and Department of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street, London, WC1H 0AJ, UK</figDesc></figure>
