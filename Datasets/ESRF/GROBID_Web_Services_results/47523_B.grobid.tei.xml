<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Stathmin-like domain proteins from vertebrates bind two tubulin molecules in a T 2 SLD complex. We have designed a stathmin-like domain that binds efficiently only one tubulin. Crystals of this assembly further complexed by an anti-tubulin DARPin have been obtained and about 10 crystals have been tested during this session. The diffraction is highly variable. Most crystals diffract to low resolution (about 7 Ang). We collected data from two crystals. One of them diffracted to around 4 Ang and was not pursued further. The second crystal diffracted to 3.2 Ang resolution. Data have been processed in the P1 space group with the following statistics: Cell dimensions a=58. 72, b=59.13, c=155.93, α=84.73, β=86.62, γ=71.70 I/sig = 9.8 (2.0), Rsym 9.1% (50%), completeness 96.8% (95.3%), multiplicity 2.5 (2.5)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Project 2: Tubulin modified with a stathmin-derived peptide</head><p>Tubulin redeally oligomerizes to protofilament-like assemblies, which makes its structural study difficult by crystallography. We have covalently linked a stahtmin-derived peptide at what is termed the longitudinal interface, which prevents this autoassembly. We co-crystallized the modified heterodimer with an antitubulin DARPin. 10 crystals of this complex have been tested during the session MX-1292. Most of them diffracted at low resolution (around 7 Å) but some diffracted to better resolution. The best dataset reached (3.7 Å resolution) displayed the following statistics: Space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 (a=58.9 Å, b=67.9 Å, c=308.3 A). I/sig = 13.9 (1.6), Rmerge 6.8 % (73.6 %), completness 98.8 % (96.4 %), multiplicity 4.7 (4.6).</p><p>There is one complex per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and the preliminary electron density maps show the positionning of the bound peptide.</p></div>		</body>
