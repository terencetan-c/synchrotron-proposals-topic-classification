<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the field of GEN IV reactor applications, determination of the diffusion coefficients is essential at all stages of the fuel cycle (fabrication and in-reactor behaviour). In the future, manufacturing processes could use mixed uranium plutonium oxide as the raw material, with a plutonium concentration ranging between 30 at% and 45 at%. Diffusion processes in uranium/plutonium-based oxides are governed by cationic diffusion. From a more basic standpoint, diffusion coefficient measurements provide a means of ascertaining the nature of defects responsible for atomic migration. The nature of defects and their quantity are directly related to the material stoichiometry (i.e. Oxygen-to-actinides ratio O/M). The aim is to determine this O/M by XANES and the related defects concentration as well as their nature and their location by EXAFS. Two mixed oxides with the same Pu Concentration (45 at%) are studying. One fabricated from the co-grinding and reactive sintering of UO 2 -45%PuO 2 , and the other from the natural sintering of the chemically prepared solid solution. Different sintering setups are studying (Temperature, sintering atmosphere, heating and cooling rates).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main achievements</head><p>XANES data have been exploited and are being interpreted. Differences appear on the values of the O/M ratio according to the experimental method chosen to determine it (XAFS/XRD/TGA/modeling) as well as between the two materials for same sintering setups. We are processing the data in order to:</p><p>get an interpretation and possibly bring information on the way to determine O/M ratio with other experimental methods on such Pu concentrated mixed oxide (not well known material over a Pu concentration of 30 at%) understand why there are differences between the O/M ratios of the two materials.</p><p>EXAFS spectra are being processed as well. Apart the objectives related to the interpretation of those data, they will possibly bring information to explain why differences exist between the O/M ratios of the two materials for similar sintering setups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main delays and difficulties encountered &amp; corrective actions taken</head><p>The project progresses according to the frame of the PhD thesis of Sébastien NOYAU (completion foreseen by end of May 2012). No corrective actions are needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publications</head><p>We plan to prepare one publication within May 2012 including this project. It will be dedicated (amongst other correlated studies) to results from the XAFS experiment including O/M ratio determination, relation between O/M ratio and defects nature and concentration, comparison between the two solid solutions obtain by two different ways. This work will be also published as a part of the PhD thesis of Sébastien NOYAU. This work has not been yet presented in the frame of an international conference.</p></div>			</div>
