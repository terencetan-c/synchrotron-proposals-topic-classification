<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples measured</head><p>The samples measured were pure fats (PO, AMF, HPKS as reference) and suspensions consisting of these fats and sucrose particles. Additionally, sucrose esters were added as dispersing agents.</p><p>Research subject Within the Food Structure &amp; Function Research Group, the study of fats, and their polymorphic behavior is a main research activity. Different X-ray scattering techniques can be used to elucidate the fat crystal network (see figure 1; left shows build-up of fat crystal network; right shows different X-ray scattering length scales</p><p>and their use for elucidation of fat crystal network). Special interest is put into the investigation of the mesoscale structure, including nanoplatelet size and aggregation. Therefore, the use of USAXS is of great interest as information can be obtained after fitting of the results with Unified fit or Guinier-Porod model.</p><p>Set-up of the measurement and related experimental problems Samples were measured under shear, using a Linkam CSS450 equipped with nitrogen dewar for cooling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> Left). Samples were loaded into the shear cell after which they were heated to 70°C. To make efficient use of time, the hutch was locked during this heating period of 10 min. Next, the samples were cooled at 20°C/min to 20 or 25°C and hold isothermally for 60 min. Shear was applied during the first 15 min of crystallization. The shear cell is designed with a 3-fold propeller (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> Right) that rotates when applying shear to the sample. When rotating, the three propeller ends block the beam for a short period of time. This is inherently related to the design of the shear cell. Measurements at the synchrotron facility are such short time frames that it was still possible to acquire data, which has proven unsuccessful on a lab-scale equipment. Both slow (1/s) and fast (50/s) shear rates were applied and both conditions have shown possible to obtain data. For statistics of the data, 10 short acquisitions were taken and then averaged. It will of course be necessary to check for every acquisition if it was blocked by the propellor, especially at the fast shear rate. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes &amp; Publications</head><p>Publication for ME1642 will also be made, however, data must be put together with other experimental data from own laboratory (DSC, PLM, cryo-SEM…) which requires more time. Moreover, more effort will be put into the modelling part of the data. Detailed research findings are kept confidential for now not to compromise on any publications.</p><p>Submission of a publication from the data obtained during experimental session ME1606 is in progress, abstract can be found below. Abstract: Despite some controversy, palm oil (PO) is still widely used for the production of all types of food products. Due to its triacylglycerol composition, PO is semisolid at ambient temperature, offering possibilities for many applications. In this study, PO was crystallized under three temperature protocols (fast (FC) and slow (SC) cooling to 20°C or fast cooling to 25°C) and followed for 1h isothermal time. A broad toolbox was used to fundamentally unravel the structural build-up of the fat crystal network at different length scales. Wideangle and small-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS &amp; SAXS) showed polymorphic transitions from α 2L to β' 2L over time. Despite similar polymorphism and chain length structure, ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) showed clear differences on the mesoscale. Unified fit analysis showed radius of gyration (Rg) values of 728 Å, 1506 Å and 1689 Å for FC-20, SC-20 and FC-25, respectively. Guinier-Porod shape factor confirms the non-spherical structure of the platelets. The microstructure was visualized with polarized light microscopy (PLM) and cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), showing clear differences in crystallite size, clustering and network morphology.</p></div>
