<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background summary: Emulsions prepared with egg yolk and linseed oil were likely used as paint binders during the 15th century. This painting technique recently gained the interest of the scientific community, but little is known about the structure at the microscopic scale of such emulsion-based paints. This experiment aims at using X-Ray nano-holotomography to investigate this structure on dry mock-up paint samples with various binder compositions and pigments. Preliminary tests conducted on ID16B at 17 keV on such samples demonstrated the ability of holotomography to discriminate the continuous and dispersed phases in a dried emulsion, despite their small difference in density.</p><p>Experimental methodology: Mock-up paint samples were prepared in advance by dispersing a pigment (chosen among azurite Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, lead-tin yellow Pb2SnO4 or hollow silica spheres) in a binder (egg yolk, raw linseed oil, linseed oil heated with lead oxide PbO, oil-in-water o/w or water-in-oil w/o emulsions prepared with egg yolk and either raw linseed oil or linseed oil heated with PbO). Reference binders, without dispersed pigment, were also prepared. These samples were mounted on Kapton loops, 100 or 200µm in diameter, and left to dry for 7 weeks. An additional historical paint microfragment from Colantonio's St Jerome in his study (ca. 1445) was mounted on a Kapton loop. The beam energy was 29.6 keV. 2505 projections were acquired over 360°, with an exposure time between 60 and 240 ms, depending on the sample. First a single distance CT was acquired with a field of view of 526 x 526 x 526 µm 3 (pixel size 257 nm) and reconstructed using PyNX. A smaller ROI, 100 µm one each side, was then identified, and a four-distance holotomography, with a pixel size of 50nm, was then acquired on this ROI. A fast reconstruction was performed on site using PyNX to check data quality. Reconstructed slices were visualized using ImageJ. A more advanced reconstruction using an inhouse procedure was later performed, to get the final reconstructed volume. Repeated acquisitions were also conducted on two samples and showed no beam damage. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results :</head><p>Binders : egg yolk and linseed oil can clearly be distinguished in CT images. In particular, egg yolk displays two distinct phases, dense spherical structures with diameters in the 0.3-2 µm range, identified as the egg yolk granules, i.e. protein-rich aggregates, dispersed in a less dense continuous phase, the egg yolk plasma (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, left). These charateristic features allow further differentiation between egg and oil in dried emulsions, and show that the structure of the binder (o/w or w/o), previously studied on fresh emulsions using confocal microscopy, is kept during drying (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, middle and right). However, despite the difference between egg yolk and oil, the contrast in these images remains lower than during preliminary tests conducted at 17 keV. Binders + pigments : for all the mock-up paints, pigments can easily be discriminated from the binder thanks to their higher density. However, the contrast in the organic phase is unsufficient to distinguish granules, plasma and linseed oil: after segmentation of the pigments, a single population can be seen in the pixel intensity histogram of the binder (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Image analysis, in particular investigation of the binder structure in the presence of pigment particles, is therefore limited at this point. Further developments are underway to try to enhance the contrast within the organic phase. Historical sample : The various pictorial layers of Colantonio's paint fragment, previously identified using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), can be identified in CT images <ref type="bibr">(cf. Fig 3)</ref> thanks to the pigment nature (pigment density and morphology). Again, information on the binder are limited at this point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The whole set of samples (29 mock-up binders and paints + 1 historical fragment) have been analyzed using X-Ray nano-holotomography. Egg yolk distinctive structure can be used to investigate the microscopic organization of dried emulsions. Data acquired on samples containing pigments could not be fully exploited yet due to poor contrast in the binder. More results on this particular point may come in the following months thanks to ongoing work in the data reconstruction.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: reconstructed holotomography slices of dry binders.
