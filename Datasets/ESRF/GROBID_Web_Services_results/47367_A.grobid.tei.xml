<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Mn doped Ge is promising as a magnetic semiconductor. To confirm the realization of a magnetic semiconductor, we need to exam if there is secondary phase present beside the diluted matrix. Therefore, synchortron based XRD with is especially needed for this purpose.</p><p>During the experiment, we focused on two questions: (1) by in-situ annealing of Mn implanted Ge, we want to check if Mn-rich secondary phases formed, (2) if Mn-rich secondary phases formed in pulsed laser annealed Ge:Mn.</p><p>The samples were prepared by Mn ion implantation into Ge(001) and Ge(111) wafers. The experimental at BM20 was done with an x-ray wavelength of 0.1078 nm.</p><p>(1) In-situ annealing at vacuum: Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the XRD 2θ-θ scans during increasing annealing temperature for Mn implanted Ge(001) wafers.</p><p>During annealing, 2θ-θ scans were measured to monitor the possible secondary phase formation. Up to 500 °C, one only see the Ge(001) peak and cannot detect any secondary phases within the detection limit. However, due to the possible contamination of O 2 in the chamber, the Ge wafer was decomposed with increasing temperature. This has been verified after taking sample out from the chamber. (2) In-situ annealing in Ar atomosphere: Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the results of Mn implanted Ge(111) annealed in Ar atomosphere. The max. annealing temperature reached is 500 °C. No secondary phase is detectable. After taking sample out from the chamber, we verify that the sample was not decomposed. (3) Pulsed laser annealing of Mn implanted Ge(004): Pulsed laser annealing has been performed at Jenaoptic. By transimission electron microscopy, we see indication of Mn-rich phase which is very probably amorphous. We use XRD to verify if there is secondary crystalline phase. The result is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. One can clearly see that within the detection limit there is no crystalline phase within the Ge matrix. In a short conclusion, the proposed experiment 'in-situ annealing of Mn implanted Ge' is feasible at BM20. But we have to anneal the sample in Ar atomosphere to aviod decomposition due to the O 2 /H 2 O contaminiation on the sample surface. We also have to do some pre-treatment before annealing in vacuum. At this moment, we are measuring the magnetic properties of the annealed sample (in Ar atomosphere). Then we hope to understand what happened in the sample. In the next experiment, we will continue with this topic to understand the phase transformation of Mn implanted Ge.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Shengqiang Zhou: Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf Artem Shalimov: Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</figDesc></figure>
