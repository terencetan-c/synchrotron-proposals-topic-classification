<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the edge, for the three compositions. This increasing signal give absolutely homothetic curves and is due to sample fluorescence. Then as no anomalous feature can be seen, germanium doped silica as far as c3 doping is homogeneous in composition. In-situ temperature SAXS experiment has also been performed in this anomalous setting. No anomalous effect can be demonstrated as the temperature increases. Extrapolation of I(q=0) versus heating temperature for the samples c1, c2, c3, has been done. At first, I(q=0) increases as germanium concentration increases. Then the low and high temperature asymptotes slopes decrease in accordance with material « softening »; the junction between the two asymptote happens at a temperature corresponding to the fictive temperature, it is then possible to determine decreasing fictive temperatures 1300, 1000 and 900°C respectively for samples c1, c2, c3. The intersection of the two asymptotes give an estimation of the fitive temperature : respectively 1300, 1000 and 900°C for the samples c1, c2, c3.</p><p>Thus, when germanium concentration increases, fictive temperature and density fluctuations decrease but in the same time concentrations fluctuations increase strongerly leading to a higher zero anlge SAXS signal.</p><p>The results of this experiment are very important for this study, and also give rise to new experimental projects : c3 concentration is lower than 1/4, then it would be interesting to study anomalous signal over this concentration to check that Germanium speading in the samples keeps homogeneous.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>fig.1 : c3doped glass Signal for different incident beam energies.</figDesc></figure>
