<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Lithium batteries have a large potential for use in electrical vehicles, but several challenges must be tackled before large scale introduction of electrical vehicles is possible including increasing the energy and power densities, improving safety and reducing the price. Improved materials and an increased fundamental understanding of the electrochemical reactions and microstructural changes taking place during operation are needed. The aim of the present study was to use high energy diffraction to obtain time resolved information about the chemical and structural changes taking place in commercial lithium batteries during charge/discharge at operating conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>The commercial batteries (From Amita Technologies) were mounted on a rotatable xyz translation stage. The batteries are approximately 130x98x7.5 mm in size and are built up as stack of parallel connected battery cells. The batteries were connected to a charging/discharging device, ALC 8000-Plus, and aligned with the stacking direction parallel to the X-ray beam. A Frelon2K detector with a pixel size of ~47x48 µm was placed ~633 mm from the battery. Powder diffraction data were collected during charging/discharging of the batteries using a wavelength of 0.12492 Å and exposure times of 1-5 s. Two types of experiments were performed. A mapping experiment where an area of the battery across the two current collectors was monitored by moving the battery during charging/discharging and a single point experiment where the battery was kept at a certain position during charging/discharging. The batteries were oscillated ±2º during the exposure in the single point experiments to increase the number of grains in diffraction conditions. This resulted in a time-resolution of 8.4 s per scan (exposure time + data readout time) for the single point experiments and 8.5 s per scan for the mapping experiments. The data were converted to one-dimensional powder pattern using the program FIT2D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows in situ XRPD patterns collected in a single point of a LiCo x Ni y Mn z O-based battery during a charge-discharge-charge cycle. The powder diffraction patterns reveal the transformations in the cathode and anode materials during charging and discharging. Lithium ions migrate from the cathode material into the graphitic anode material during charging of the battery. The lithium ions intercalate the layered graphite structure and form lithiated graphite phases. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows that the intercalation process proceeds via a non-stoichiometric Li x C phase to stoichiometric LiC 12 and LiC 6 phases. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows integrated peak intensities of the 001 reflections of LiC 6 , LiC 12 and Li x C phases demonstrating that the LiC 6 and LiC 12 coexist in the charged battery and that the Li x C is the only graphitic phase present in the discharged battery. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> shows the d-spacing of the 002 reflection of the Li x C phase. The discharged battery has a dspacing of ~3.37 Å which is comparable to that of pure graphite (~3.35 Å).  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> shows in situ XRPD patterns of a mapping experiment of a commercial LiFePO 4 battery where the battery was translated laterally in 51 steps of 1 mm across the two current collectors during charging and discharging. The figure reveals the phase transformations caused by the migration of the lithium ions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref> shows the normalized integrated intensities of the 002 diffraction peaks of the FePO 4 and LiFePO 4 phases demonstrating that a two-phase transformation is occurring in the cathode material where LiFePO 4 is formed by intercalation of lithium into the FePO 4 structure during the discharging of the battery and vice versa during charging. a) b) a) b) a) b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a) In situ XRPD patterns of a commercial LiCo x Ni y Mn z O battery collected during a charge (red)-discharge (grey)-charge (red) cycle. b) A magnified section of the region around the 001 reflections of LiC 6 , LiC 12 and Li x C phases.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,296.52,108.18,246.55,129.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
