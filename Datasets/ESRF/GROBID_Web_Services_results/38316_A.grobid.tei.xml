<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the experiment</head><p>The in-situ synthesis of the distorted perovskite BiXO 3 (with X = Mn and Cr) under high pressure -high temperature (HP-HT) conditions was studied. The main interests of these experiments were firstly to collect accurate information on the HP-HT phase diagram of BiXO 3 (phase transitions, optimal synthesis conditions, melting point) and secondly, to get thermodynamic data needed to achieve the single crystal growth of these compounds using the flux method based on boric acid H 3 BO 3 . The experiment was carried out on the ID27 beam line using a MAR CCD detector at a wavelength of 0.173Ǻ, using the Paris-Edinburgh cell with standard tungsten carbide anvils and 7 mm boron-epoxy gaskets. The starting mixtures were put into gold or platinum capsules (1.4 mm diameter and 2.4 mm height) specially fabricated by us for the ESRF experiment. To provide suitable conditions for the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns acquisition on an image plate detector of potential fast phase transitions or reactions during the heat treatments at fixed pressure, we worked at moderate heating rates (around 10°C/min). In order to reduce the exposure time to typically 30seconds, the radial Soller slits were generally not used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results on the in-situ study of the HP-HT synthesis and phase diagram of BiCrO 3</head><p>The initial powder was a stoichiometric mixture of Bi 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 . The pressure and temperature, estimated from the XRD peaks of BN and Au using their equation of state, was first increased up to 2 GPa, then the temperature was ramped to about 1000°C. A 2D and 3D-illustration of the in-situ synthesis of BiCrO 3 at 2 GPa are shown on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, respectively. After an amorphization under pressure of the initial Bi 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 powders, followed by a progressive recrystallization during the heating, two abrupt transitions are observed around 550°C and 670°C. The first one corresponds to the formation of BiCrO 3 , and the second one is identified as a structural transition of remaining Bi 2 O 3 , from a monoclinic to a cubic symmetry. A similar experiment was carried out at 6 GPa. The data analysis is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results on the in-situ study of the HP-HT synthesis and phase diagram of BiMnO 3</head><p>As for BiCrO 3 , BiMnO 3 HP-HT synthesis was studied starting from a stoichiometric mixture of Bi 2 O 3 + Mn 2 O 3 at 4.5 GPa and 6 GPa. As shown on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, after the broadening of the XRD peaks during the pressurization a first recrystallization of the initial reactants occurs, then at relatively low temperature an intermediate phase crystallized. The identification of this phase is underway. Then, at higher temperature the BiMnO 3 phase appears in its orhtorhombic form. When the heating is stopped at 4.5 GPa, BiMnO 3 undergoes a phase transition towards its monoclinic phase which is recovered after complete decompression. The 6 GPa experiment is not shown in this report. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results on the study of HP-HT conditions for single crystal growth of BiCrO 3 and BiMnO 3</head><p>The initial mixture was Bi 2 O 3 + Cr 2 O 3 (or Mn 2 O 3 ) + 5wt% of H 3 BO 3 . The pressure and thermal cycles were programmed as previously, except that after a dwell time at high temperature a very slow cooling rate was used to create adapted conditions for the growth of single crystals in the liquid. At 2.5 GPa, the first peaks of BiCrO 3 are observed around 670°C which is little higher than the temperature observed during the « simple » synthesis, without boric acid, suggesting that a slightly different reaction mechanism occurs in presence of H 3 BO 3 . During cooling, diffraction spots are clearly identified on the</p><p>20 °C ~ 550 ~1000 ~ 670</p><p>diffraction rings of BiCrO 3 (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>), showing that some single crystals were growing. In similar experiments at higher pressure, single crystals BiMnO 3 diffraction spots were also identified. A detailed analysis of these BiXO 3 /H 3 BO 3 data is still underway, to study precisely the reaction mechanisms and characterize the growth conditions.
