<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>These resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments performed at the Ce L, edge [2ps+2#(4fid)+l followed by 2p5(4f5d)+1~3~(4f5d)+l] aim at an improved understanding of the interaction between the 4felectron and the conduction states in a variety of Ce alloys and multilayers with varying magnetic properties. Distinguishing between well localized or delocalized states is one of the properties of such experiments provided a large data set is measured as a function of both incoming photon energy and scattered photon energy. The resolution is limited by the 3d core-hole lifetime (and not the Zp lifetime) which justifies the use of high experimental resolution. The x-ray spectrometers now available at ESRF for analyzing the scattered x-rays are not suited to this particular experiment because they are designed for higher energies. Our instrument uses a cylindrically bent quartz 2023 crystal working under UHV. It requires a focused primary beam for best resolving power. On ID12A a line focus = 20 /.un in the vertical plane is available. Under these conditions we measured the analyzer resolution to be 0.5 eV at 5 keV.</p><p>We chose two alloys, CePds and CeCuSi, and two multilayers Ce./Fe and CeHfle as representative of systems with a-like or y-like properties. CePds and Cc/Fe are a-like and have two peaks of comparable amplitude in the L, absorption spectrum. This may be explained in terms of a well screened 2p hole (there is a localized 4f electron and a 5d conduction electron in the final state) and a less well screened 2p hole configuration resulting from 4f -5d interaction.</p><p>Our measurements concentrated on the analysis of the RMS both close to the L, edge and in regions where structure is observed in the absorption spectrum.</p><p>Our preliminary conclusions are :. i) In the pre-edge region quadrupole transitions are indeed present (3d94f%dO final state) as reported for other rare earths. However the shape and relative intensities of this structure is significantly different according to whether the sample is a-like or y-like.</p><p>ii) Beyond the first absorption peak, the shape of the 3d+2p inelastic scattering varies markedly according to the type of sample examined indicating varying degrees of localization and multiplet structure. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 RlXS data for a CeH ,lFe multilayer.
