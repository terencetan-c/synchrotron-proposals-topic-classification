<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction -In situ GISAXS and XRF measurements were performed at the DUBBLE BM26B beamline with the aim to elucidate the morphological and compositional evolution of supported cubic superlattices of PbSe Quantum Dots (QDs) during (i) thermal annealing and (ii) Al 2 O 3 overcoating using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Secondly, the growth of HfO 2 and ZnO via ALD on CdSe/CdS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS QDs was explored, aiming to deposit a continuous protective layer against environmental damaging agents such as oxygen and water.</p><p>Experimental -The experiments can be divided in two sets, depending on the type of QDs that were used. First, we evaluated the thermal stability of PbSe QDs forming cubic superlattices. Different sizes of QDs and QDs with and without Pb-oleate surface ligands were compared. The samples were annealed in He or 20% O 2 in He (1 bar) up to 375 o C (0.2 o C/s). Moreover, different thicknesses of Al 2 O 3 overcoats were grown via ALD using the trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H 2 O process, and their protective and stabilizing effect during thermal treatment was investigated. Second, the encapsulation of CdSe/CdS/ZnS (core/shell/shell) QDs in HfO 2 and of CdSe/CdS (core/shell) QDs in ZnO was investigated. HfO 2 was deposited using the Tetrakis(dimethylamido)hafnium(IV) (TDMAHf) and O 3 ALD process. ZnO was grown from Diethyl Zinc (DEZ) and H 2 O vapour. The incidence beam energy was set to 14 keV to excite and record the Pb Lα, Se Kα, Cd Lα, Hf Lα and Zn Kα XRF emission lines. At this energy, however, the beam photon flux was only 30% of the flux at 12 keV (used during previous campaigns), limiting the quality of the GISAXS images recorded. To compensate this loss of intensity, the beam size at the sample position was set to 4 mm × 1 mm (H×V). The GISAXS patterns were recorded using the installed PILATUS3 S 1M detector (Dectris®), while the XRF spectra were acquired using a Vortex® detector from the detector pool.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. PbSe QDs superlattices:</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows the evolution of the ratio of Se/Pb XRF intensity measured during heating of a selected PbSe superlattice. The Se/Pb XRF intensity ratio stays roughly constant up to a temperature of ~320 ºC. At higher temperatures, the Se/Pb XRF intensity ratio drastically decreases, pointing to the loss of Se atoms. The same onset temperature for QD degradation, ~320 ºC, was observed for all samples, irrespective of the presence or absence of Pb-oleate surface ligands, the size of the QDs, the presence of an Al 2 O 3 coating covering the superlattice, or the annealing in He or a 20% O 2 atmosphere. For the QDs without overcoating, the corresponding GISAXS patterns showed a decrease in intensity of the characteristic scattering signal associated to the superlattice ordering (~q y = 0.95 nm -1 ) from about the same temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). However, for the PbSe superlattices overcoated with ALDgrown Al 2 O 3 layers, the superlattice ordering remained present up to ~375 ºC, despite the loss of Se. Different thicknesses of protective alumina layers were investigated (i.e. ~10, 20, 30 nm corresponding to 100, 200 and 300 ALD cycles respectively), and only the thickest Al 2 O 3 layer (i.e. 30 nm) could partly prevent the Se evaporation from the sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). However, it can be triggered by pre-exposing the QDs to TMA, as we investigated previously <ref type="bibr">[JPCC 120, 18039, 2016]</ref>. Here, we screened different pretreatments to trigger the growth of ZnO on CdSe/CdS QDs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> shows the normalised XRF counts of the Zn signal measured during ALD growth of ZnO on (i) a SiO 2 reference, (ii) a monolayer of CdSe/CdS QDs which were exposed to an Ar plasma pretreatment, and (iii) the same QDs exposed to an O 2 plasma pretreatment. Following an initial slower growth, the ZnO growth on SiO 2 (green symbols) reaches a linear growth regime after ca. 20 ALD cycles. A pretreatment of the QDs with an exposure of 5s Ar plasma (red symbols) shows a small increase in the amount of deposited ZnO. However, the growth is not yet triggered and levels off. After an exposure of 4x30s to the Ar plasma, the growth of ZnO really takes off and continues steadily. The influence of O 2 plasma is seen in the black data points. An exposure of 1s O 2 plasma shows again a small increase in the amount of deposited Zn while an exposure of 5s triggers the growth of ZnO. Complementarily, the influence of a pretreatment with TMA, O 3 , TDMAHf, and (CH 2 TMS) 2 S was investigated. Non of this pretreatments triggered the growth of ZnO on CdSe/CdS QDs. Conclusions -The beamtime at BM26B allowed us to systematically investigate the thermal stability of a series of PbSe QDs. This knowledge will be important input for our ongoing work which explores the use of a temperature treatment to increase the necking between the supported QDs and improve the charge transport of the QD layer. Preliminary results also demonstrated that ALD of HfO 2 is a suitable technique for overcoating CdSe QD-based layers that act as barrier against environmental oxygen and moisture while maintaining the photoluminescent properties of the QDs. Finally, XRF indicated that a plasma pretreatment is required to initiate the growth of ZnO on CdSe/CdS QDs. An investigation of the effect of the plasma pretreatment on the photoluminescent properties of the QDs is ongoing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

(b) Representative GISAXS patterns of the PbSe QDs without overcoat recorded during the annealing procedure under He atmosphere, showing the intensity decrease of the characteristic scattering signal of the ordered cubic superlattice (~q y = 0.95 nm -1 ) at temperatures above 320°C. II. HfO 2 and ZnO on QDs: Figure 2a depicts the normalised Hf XRF counts measured during ALD growth of HfO 2 on (i) a native Si/SiO 2 (100) reference substrate, (ii) a monolayer of CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs, and (iii) a monolayer of the CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs where the ligands where removed prior to the ALD deposition. The results show that the HfO 2 growth rate is linear and without any incubation period during the first ALD cycles, even on the QDs. It is known that the ALD growth of ZnO on CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs via the DEZ/H 2 O process is strongly inhibited.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,289.30,51.50,227.80,143.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>
