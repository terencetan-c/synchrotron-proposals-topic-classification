<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Our previous investigations on both artificially aged model samples of commercial lead chromate <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and two paint cross-sections taken from paintings by V. van Gogh <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> demonstrated for the first time that the alteration of chrome yellow is caused by the reduction of original PbCrO 4 to Cr 2 O 3 •2H 2 O (viridian green).</p><p>Among the model samples analyzed, only the paint sample containing a high amount of PbSO 4 showed a clear darkening after the photochemical ageing treatment. A strong spatial correlation between the exposed brown altered layer and the Cr(III) abundance was found.</p><p>Cr K-edge µ-XANES analysis performed on both Van Gogh paint micro-samples, revealed the presence of Cr(III) species in areas rich in Ba and S and/or aluminum-silicate compounds.</p><p>Based on these previous investigations, we could arrive at the tentative conclusion that SO 4  2-anions are involved in some manner in the alteration mechanism of PbCrO 4 , without however it being clear what exactly the role is they play. In this regard, a hypothesis was formulated that in the presence of abundant sulfate ions, also a minor amount of sulfide ions can be formed in situ that might act as reducing agent for the chromate ions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Overview of samples investigated</head><p>In continuity with the first two parts of this work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> photochemical aged oil paint model samples, containing different PbCrO 4 :PbSO 4 mixtures and co-precipitates (these latter sometimes added with a little amount of others sulfide/sulfate compounds) were examined at the beamline ID21 by means of μ-XRF and μ-XANES analyses around the Cr and S K-edge. All samples were prepared by applying a thin layer of paint on polycarbonate and glass microscopy slides. Similar investigations were also performed on two embedded micro-paint samples, taken from the painting Falling Leaves ("Les Alyscamps") by Vincent van Gogh (sample F486) and the low-relief Soyez mystérieuses by Paul Gauguin (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). (A) (B) 2.1 Artificially aged model samples of co-precitates of lead chromate and sulfate (a) Reproduction of the darkening process of the previous investigated historic aged model sample A As Fig. 2A illustrates, after UVA-visible irradiation, the oil paint model samples prepared using a 25:75 PbCrO 4 :PbSO 4 selfsynthesized coprecipitate (sample S 3D ) showed a similar tendency to darkening as previously was observed for the historic sample A (~ 60% SO 4 2-</p><p>).</p><p>[1] Series of Cr-K edge XANES spectra were collected from embedded aged sample S 3D (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>) revealing a relative concentration of Cr(III) [expressed as Cr(III)]/∑Cr total ] up to 60% in the exposed brown discoloured area (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>, brown spectrum and Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). This result was demonstrated by a clear decrease of the intensity of the Cr pre-edge peak at 5.993 keV and a shift of the absorption edge toward lower energies (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). However, the Cr(III) abundance decreased progressively when moving toward the yellow bulk of the sample, where it reaches a value of around 20% (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>, orange spectrum, and Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). Similar to the previously investigated sample A, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>   XANES spectra: 10.5 μm U Un na ag ge ed d A Ag ge ed d (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (b) Photochemical ageing treatments using narrow energy ranges of UV-visible radiation</p><p>In order to evaluate the extent to which the specific spectral range of the light had an influence on the (speed of the) degradation process, photochemical ageing treatments using various narrow energy ranges of UV-visible radiation were performed on several coupons prepared using a 25:75 PbCrO 4 :PbSO 4 self-synthesized coprecipitate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3A</ref>). According to the discoloration that was observed, semi-quanititatively linear fitting combination of a series of μ-XANES Cr-K edge spectra collected from the aged embedded samples revealed a correlation between the relative Cr(III) abundance and the darkening. The highest amount of Cr(III) (up to 58%) was estimated after ageing by means of UVA-visible (λ≥300 nm) and UV light exposure (240 nm≤λ≤400 nm) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>, green and purple spectra). While still minor differences were observed in the XANES spectrum of paint sample aged by means of visibleblue light [~30% of Cr(III), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) artificially aged model paint samples containing different amount of sulfate</head><p>In order to explore the relation between the tendency towards darkening of the paint and its composition, photochemical ageing employing UVA-visible light were carried out on both self-synthesized (samples S 1 , S 3A , S 3B , S 3C , S 3D ) and commercial (sample D 1 ) powders of chrome yellow containing different amount of sulfate (from 10% to 75% see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>). Investigations were also carried out on model paint samples has been prepared: (i) by simply mixing commercial PbCrO 4 and PbSO 4 in 1:2 molar ratio (sample D 2 ) instead of employing the above-mentioned co-precipitate; (ii) by mixing the synthesized powder of sample S 3C (50% SO 4</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2-</head><p>) with a little amount of BaSO 4 or ZnS (samples S 5 and S 9 , not shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>). After a preliminary XANES characterization of all above-mentioned not embedded paint samples (unfocused mode), because of the relatively high depth penetration value of the X-ray beam at the Cr K-edge energy, also measurements in focused mode were carried out in order to obtain a reliable estimation of the amount of reduced Cr(VI) present in the thin and superficial alteration layer. For this purpose, series of Cr-K edge XANES spectra were collected from embedded cross-sections of aged sample S 1 (pure PbCrO 4 ), S 3B (25% SO 4</p><p>2-), S 3D (75% SO 4 2-), S 5 (50% SO 4 2-+BaSO 4 ), S 9 (50% SO 4 2-+ZnS) and D 1 (50% SO 4 2-</p><p>, commercial powder). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>, the linear combination fitting of XANES spectra reveal that the amount of Cr(III) at the exposed surface progressively increased when going from aged samples S 1 (0% sulfate) to S 3D (75% sulfates) Particularly, for the aged samples S 1 , S 3B and D 1 the relative Cr(III) concentration, was estimated to be around 30-20% along the first 3 μm of the cross-section, while for S 3D , S 5 and S 9 this value decreased progressively from the superficial brown layer [Cr(III) present at around 60-40% relative] toward the yellow bulk of the sample (where it reaches a value of around 40-20%). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(A) (B) (C)</head><p>Although the sulfate amount of the commercial co-precipitate (D 1 ) was estimated by means of SEM-EDX and XRD analysis to be similar to that of S 3C (~50%), its greater stability toward light exposure [Cr(III) present at around 20% relative] can be explained when its crystalline structure is taken into account.</p><p>According to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> methods to favor the co-precipitation of the more stable monoclinic mixed crystal of lead-chromate and sulfate were introduced during the industrial manufacture of the modern chrome yellow pigments. Furthermore the fact that (i) only a negligible color change has been observed after ageing of a simple mixture of pure PbCrO 4 :PbSO 4 (sample D 2, results not illustrated) and (ii) a similar relative Cr(III) amount was estimated for aged samples S 5 and S 9 , indicates the necessity for the sulfate anions to be present in the crystalline structure of the yellow pigment to be able to play a key role on the darkening process. (commercial powder) and D2 (mixture of PbCrO4 and PbSO4), -results not illustrated-generally, Cr K-edge XANES measurements agree to the fact that significant difference were revealed on the aged samples containing an amount of sulfate higher than 50% (See text for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Embedded micro-paint samples</head><p>Analogous with the aged model sample, both XANES and XRF measurements revealed the presence of reduced chromium. Particularly, this alteration species were present in those areas where the PbCrO 4 :PbSO 4 paint is in contact with (degraded) varnish layers (applied as conservation treatment in the past).</p><p>As Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> illustrates, (as an example are shown some of results collected from the micro-paint sample F486, taken from the painting by V. van Gogh). Cr and S chemical state maps of a small region of the sample (Figs. 5A-5B) showed a correlation between the presence of Cr(III), K and S(VI) in the brown layer, while the surrounding unaltered yellow paint contained exclusively Cr(VI) and S(VI). S species in their reduced oxidation states were present only in the superficial degraded layer and around Cr(III) grains.</p><p>In the same area, both Cr and S K-edge μ-XANES point measurements (Figs. <ref type="figure">5C-5D</ref>) confirmed the presence of Cr(III), that a procedure of linear combination fitting of the spectra revealed to be mainly composed of a KCr(III) sulfate compound (~95%</p><p>), [Figs. 5C-5D, spectra (01)]. Differently, PbCrO 4 and PbSO 4 were confirmed to be the main components of the unaltered yellow layer [Figs. 5C-5D, spectra (02)]. Where no correlation between sulfate and Cr(III) grains were detected, the compound was identified as viridian (Cr 2 O 3 •2H 2 O) [results not shown]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hypotheses about the role of sulfate anions during the darkening of chrome yellow pigments</head><p>Investigations of model samples of self-synthesized mixed crystals of lead chromate sulfate indirectly has confirmed our previous hypothesis that locally a chemical mechanism must be in place that first causes some of the sulfates (SO While the μ-XANES investigations at the S-K edge of artificially aged model samples did not show in any case the presence of S(-II) species, it is remarkable to see that in the original paint micro samples, S(-II) species are effectively present in those varnish areas trapping small grains of PbCrO 4 that had partially or completely been reduced. This strongly suggests (a) that the above described reactions indeed may describing the reduction process of Cr(VI) while (b) that is becomes highly relevant to study the influence of the organic components of the paint and their cover layers, as the latter may play a key role on the darkening of chrome yellow pigments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 . 2 . 1</head><label>121</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
