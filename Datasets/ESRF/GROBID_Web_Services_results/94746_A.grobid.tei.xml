<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During this time slot, we performed in situ measurements in solution to track 2D COF nucleation and growth over time for various concentrations ranging from 5.0 × 10 -5 M to 5.0 × 10 -4 M. This experiment was performed over a period of 8 hours on the droplets deposited on different supports during the polymerization in order to probe the in-plane and out-plane structures and reveal the preferencial stacked structure along the support as well as providing the interlayer distances between the stacked sheets of the organic material. However, the signal was extremely low, and the synthesis procedure required more optimization to achieve the goal. Instead, to make an efficient use of time, we switched to another project entitled "Tuning the optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites by dielectric confinement engineering through substitution/mixing of intralayer organic cations". This project has been granted by the same beamline with the number 26-02 939 for GIWAXS measurements. Some hypothetic experiments as described below have been performed assuring the success of our proposal for the next measurement round.</p><p>The goal for the alternative project was to explore the effect of variation of different atomic groups on the structure of a two dimensional perovskite with the chemical formula MA2(BA/EA/GA)n-1Pbn(I/Br/Cl)3n+1. A mix of monovalent cations is employed as spacers with BA/EA (n-butylammonium/ Ethylammonium) or BA/GA (n-butylammonium/ Guanidinium). The structural modification of the 2D perovskites will permit to achieve optimum efficiency and color rendering for application in LEDs. Preliminary results on temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal clear changes in the PL spectra at lower temperatures illustrating different exciton binding energies as well as a differing fine structure of the excitons. Until now, the origin of the changes in the T-dependent photoluminescence spectra remains unclear. Moreover, a higher efficiency has been observed for LEDs made of mixed cations hinting to a better charge transportation through highly oriented layers relative to the substrate compared to the single cation-based devices. Specifically, we focused on the effect of two different groups: cation and, anion groups. These parameters can change the packing of the atomic groups in the system and hence their optoelectronic properties. GIWAXS experiments were performed at the Dutch-Belgian Beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) station BM26B in Grenoble (12 keV,  = 1.033 Å). The 2D scattering patterns were recorded using a PILATUS 1M Dectris detector. We have used a variable incident angle ranging from 0.17° to 1.8° for the measurements. Next, we used a Linkam stage to control the temperature ranging from 400 K down to 90K. The 2D scattering patterns were recorded at each temperature (every 25 K) to probe the effect of temperature on the arrangement of the interlayer cations in the structure of the materials and their structural phases. This study was performed for various concentration/ratios of the cations and at different temperatures. We also examined the effect of the substrate for a few of the samples. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates examples of the 2D scattering patterns of three different samples with different halide groups (Br, I and I/Cl) at fixed incidence angle and at different temperatures. As can be seen in the initial analysis, the structure changes upon halide substitution and temperature variation corroborating with the PL measurements. We are working on the analysis of the body of the results obtained during this measurement time and the initial analysis is promising. To summarize, not only the scientific results obtained made this time extremely fruitful but also, I benefited from becoming familiar with the setup and measurement technique as well as the data analysis. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Masoumeh Keshavarz: Molecular Imaging and Photonics, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium Report:</figDesc></figure>
