<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A number of state of the art ab initio theoretical calculations have been performed to explore the geometric structure of model metal oxide surfaces as a function of ambient conditions. Recently, two such studies have been concerned with Cr 2 O 3 (0001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, examining the impact of oxygen partial pressure and substrate temperature. The results are not in complete agreement. Specifically, at 300 K, Wander et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> conclude that this surface exhibits three distinct structures, namely -Bulk-Cr-3O-Cr, -Bulk-Cr-3O-Cr=O, and -Bulk-Cr-3O-Cr-Cr-3O terminations, as the oxygen pressure increases, whereas Wang et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> predict that the -Bulk-Cr-3O-Cr-Cr-3O phase is always the most stable structure. The goal of this study was to experimentally probe the geometric structure of Cr 2 O 3 (0001) as a function of oxygen pressure at approximately 300 K, using the wellestablished technique surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD).</p><p>The experiment was performed on ID03, employing an ultra high vacuum/high pressure (UHV/HP) chamber, in tandem with a high precision vertical diffractometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. An X-ray wavelength of 0.79 Å was utilised for the diffraction measurements. Data were accumulated using so called rocking scans, in which the sample is rotated about its surface normal while the scattered X-ray intensity is recorded. Such scans were performed for a given integer (h,k) as a function of l, providing profiles of scattered intensity, I hk , versus perpendicular momentum transfer, which are known as crystal truncation rods (CTR's).</p><p>Initially, following in situ surface preparation, involving a series of Ar + bombardment and annealing cycles, a set of CTR's was acquired from the Cr 2 O 3 (0001) surface under UHV conditions. The goal of these measurements was to determine the structure of the UHV-surface, comparing these results with previous experimental and theoretical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Oxygen was then admitted to the UHV/HP chamber, and a pressure of approximately 190 mbar was maintained, whilst diffraction data were collected. Under these conditions the Cr 2 O 3 (0001) surface was found to be very unstable, as evidenced by the significant diminishment in the intensity of reference reflections over a short time period. A possible explanation for this surface instability is the presence of reactive O 3 species, generated by the Xray beam.</p><p>To avoid this problem of surface degradation all further work focussed on significantly lower oxygen partial pressures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> displays the intensity variation of the ( € 1 1 2.9) reflection as a function of pressure/time. We note that this reflection was empirically selected on the basis of preliminary measurements indicating that it is sensitive to changes in oxygen partial pressure. It can be clearly seen that on going from an UHV environment to an oxygen partial pressure of 5x10 -5 mbar the intensity increases significantly, and then remains approximately constant for several decades of pressure. This observation strongly suggests a change in the surface geometry. CTR's were recorded at 1x10 -2 mbar to enable the structure of this 10 -2 -surface to be elucidated. As the oxygen partial pressure is increased above 1x10 -2 mbar further structural changes are indicated. The intensity of the ( € 1 1 2.9) reflection decreases and attains a minimum at around 1x10 -1 mbar, before beginning to increase again at an oxygen partial pressure of 5x10 -1 mbar. Given the limited experimental time no CTR's were acquired at these higher pressures. The reversibility of the UHV-surface/10 -2 -surface structural change was also probed by recording diffraction data following pumping down of the chamber back to UHV. No clear evidence for or against a reversible phase change was found. This result indicates that the observation of structural variation with oxygen partial pressure may be a result of kinetics rather than thermodynamics</p><p>In summary, we have shown that the surface structure of Cr 2 O 3 (0001) does vary with oxygen partial pressure. Currently, we cannot be certain that the structures observed are the lowest free energy geometries. Analysis of CTR's from the UHV-surface and 10 -2 -surface to determine their structures is ongoing. This work is progressing somewhat more slowly than anticipated, due to the presence of multiple grains within the sample, which complicated data reduction procedures. € 1 1 2.9) reflection as a function of oxygen partial pressure(mbar)/time.
