<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the recent years the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 has great potential to reduce an enormous amount of CO2 by converting CO2 into value-added products such as hydrocarbons and CH3OH. To develop highly efficient catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2, understanding of chemical phenomena underlying the metal-support interactions is crucial to design the next generation of catalysts for many industrially relevant processes. In order to study the changes in phase or structres of cobalt and ceria we turned to synchrotron based XRD. The measurements under operation condtiond with high resolution detectors allowed us to demonstrate the formation of metalic cobalt after reduction and minor changes of it's oxidation states under CO2 methanation conditions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Synchrotron-based XRD measurements allowed us to detect the changes in the unit cell and reduction of Co supported on ceria for the samples with high cobalt loading. As shown on difractograms obtained during the reduction of 10CoCeFSP full reduction Co3O4 to metalic Co occurred at 300°C (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) . In turn, the reduction of samples with low loading of Co did not show the segragation of formation of metalic cobalt during the reduction, probably due to high dispersion of Co on the surface or stabilization of Co-O-Ce interfaces(Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The refined unit cell of doped CoCeFSP showed that that the doping Co into the CeO2 leads to a significant expansion of the unit cell during the ramp of the temperature. Moreover, the stabilization of the unit cell happens faster for CoCeFSP than for CeFSP. In turn, 2.5CoFSP demonstrated bigger unit cell parameter after reduction than catalysts with higher Co loadings probably due to stabilization os Co-O-Ce interfaces into material after the reduction. Switch of reduction mixture to reaction conditions lead to increase of unit cell for all samples, that could be correlated with re-filling of CeO2 vacancies with O from CO2 during dissociative adsorption of CO2. Refined partcile sized of CeO2 for all doped CoCeFSP and CeFSP demonstrated the same trend during reduction and switch to reaction mixture. Interesting to note, that sample with low loadings of Co showed first increase in particle size and then slight decrease, that probably could be explained by structural changes or re-organisation of Co-O-Ce centers in the metarial. a) b) c) d)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
