<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPORT</head><p>Aims: New Al alloys designed for 3D printing show heterogeneous microstructures from the macroscale scale down the nanoscale with a bimodal grain structure at the melt pool scale: fine equiaxed grains (FEZ: Fine Equiaxed Zone) at the melt pool boundaries, typically &lt; 1μm; and columnar grains at the melt pool center (CZ: Columnar Zone), typically a few microns in width and &gt;10 μm in length. Second-phase intermetallic particles are also heterogeneously distributed at the microscale. Conventional microstructural characterization techniques suffer from artifacts caused by the 2D nature of the information collected. Our goal was to:</p><p>-Achieve a 3D description of the microstructure using nano-XCT: 3D arrangement of the melt pools, 3D distribution of the regions consisting of fine equiaxed grains and columnar grains, quantification of the volume fraction and morphology of the second-phase intermetallic particles. -Monitor the microstructural evolutions during a heat treatment performed at 400°C. -Investigate the 3D microscale strain heterogeneities and damage evolution and establish correlations with microstructural features.</p><p>Experiments: Two different sets of experiments were conducted to achieve the objectives described above.</p><p>(i) Static X-ray nano-tomography with scans collected at 4 different working distances on different microstructures: as-built (As-B), and after different ageing times at 400°C (400°C/1h, 400°C/4h, 400°C/96h). Scans at two different resolutions were performed: low-resolution using a voxel size of 88 nm 3 , and highresolution using a voxel size of 20 nm 3 .</p><p>(ii) In situ X-ray nano-tomography scans were acquired during room temperature tensile testing of the various microstructures investigated. Micro-tensile specimens were loaded using the NANOX ID11 micromechanical machine modified to fit with ID16B constraints. Data were reconstructed using the specific reconstruction procedures developed at ID16B which are relatively time-consuming. Image analysis procedures have been specifically developed to post-process the data, in particular, AI-assisted segmentation was employed to recognize regions consisting of fine equiaxed grains from regions consisting of columnar grains. The AI algorithm for recognition of the various regions is based on local grayscale texture. A framework allowing the determination of the microscale strain heterogeneities using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) is currently being developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The results from the static scans were reconstructed and the image analysis procedures were developed and applied to process the data. The distribution of second-phase intermetallic particles within the  At the macroscale, it is also of interest to get a 3D description of the spatial distribution of the FEZs and CZs because the resulting mechanical behaviour can be strongly affected if one of the region is found percolating in 3D. This idea is of utmost importance because such microstructures can be considered as a composite materials with FEZs and CZs having different mechanical behaviour. The AI-assisted sgementation algorithm, developed specifically in this work, was successfully applied to the as-built microstructure to distinguish FEZs from CZs in 3D images. This is possible because of the high resolution of the nano-XCT scans, see comparison between a SEM-BSE image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>) and a 2D cross-section extracted from a 3D reconstructed image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>). An example of the 3D spatial distribution of the FEZs and CZs is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>. A similar approach is being developed to be able to process larger 3D images with low-resolution images (voxel size of 88 nm 3 ). DVC based on the local contrast offered by the microstructure itself is expected to provide new insights into the development of strain heterogeneities. Preliminary results are encouraging. We should thus soon be able to evidence the evolution of the difference in mechanical behaviour between the FEZs and CZs upon ageing at 400°C.</p></div>
