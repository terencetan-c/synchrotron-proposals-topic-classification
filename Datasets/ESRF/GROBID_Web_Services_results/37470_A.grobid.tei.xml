<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SI-1578 was proposed to investigate the kinetic aspects of the growth and the structure of organic heterostructures formed by diindenoperylene (DIP) and phthalocyanines. Previous experiments performed at ID10B (SI-1021) revealed unexpected and interesting results about the growth of DIP on F 16 CuPc. It was seen that a rearrangement of the F 16 CuPc occurs when DIP is evaporated on top at high temperature. Neither this rearrangement nor the associated Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth of the DIP takes place if the heterostructure is grown at low temperature. Our goal was to get an insight into the transition from the initial to the rearranged structure, as well as the threshold temperature above which it occurs. The objectives have been succesfully accomplished and the study has been further extended to DIP/F 16 CoPc heterostructures.</p><p>Starting with the growth of DIP on F 16 CuPc, we have now observed the reconstruction process by stepwise DIP deposition on top of 3 monolayers (ML) of F 16 CuPc at 120 ºC. The results of monitoring the in-plane structure with GIXD scans after each step are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The initial peaks at q values of 0.41 and 1.90 Å -1 , corresponding to the β bilayer F 16 CuPc structure (marked with the straight lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), decrease as new shifted peaks appear at 0.50 and 1.87 Å -1 (marked with the corresponding arrows in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The larger peak at higher q values apparently presents a continuous shift to its new position. This, however, is expected to be an artifact by the proximity of the peaks and the large peak width, which causes an overlap of both contributions. The range at smaller q values evidences the gradual appearance of the new peak with coverage, associated with a simultaneous decrease of the initial reflection. This proves the transition not to be a gradual change in the molecular orientations within the film, but rather an abrupt rearrangement of all the molecules into the new structure. The coexistence of both contributions until coverages of about 1.2 ML DIP is understood as the coexistence of the initial structure in those F 16 CuPc areas uncovered by DIP, with the reconstructed structure in the areas covered by the DIP. The completeness of the DIP wetting layer (and consequently the reconstruction) is obtained at about 1.2 ML coverage.</p><p>In order to determine the threshold temperature above which the reconstruction takes place, we have checked the in-plane structure of heterostructures grown at different temperatures. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. Going down from temperatures of 120 to 70 ºC no changes are observed appart of the reduced order, mirrored in an increased peak width. However, since we know from previous measurements that the reconstruction does not take place at RT, the threshold temperature must be between 30 and 70 ºC. Now we focus on the growth of DIP on F 16 CoPc. F 16 CoPc on SiO 2 presents a comparable film structure as F 16 CuPc. Only two in-plane reflections appear at low coverages (3 ML), at values of 0.43 and 1.97 Å -1 . The GIXD scans taken after various deposition steps in the growth of DIP on top of 3 ML F 16 CuPc at RT and 120 ºC are shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, respectively. We find a similar scenario as in the DIP/F 16 CuPc heterostructures, i.e. DIP deposition leads to a reconstruction of the underlying phthalocyanine layer at high temperature, but not at lower temperatures. The shifted peaks corresponding to the reconstructed layer appear at q values of 0.52 and 1.89 Å -1 , respectively (as marked by the arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Also in this case the reconstruction is not a gradual change of the molecular orientation within the films, but an abrupt rearrangement into the new structure. This is evidenced by the evolution with increasing coverage of each of the two pairs of peaks. However, in this case the reconstruction is not finished until 3 ML of DIP are deposited, corresponding to the coverage at which the wetting layer is completed.</p><p>From measurements on heterostructures with different F 16 CoPc thicknesses (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) we find that the reconstruction affects only the upper 2-3 phthalocyanine layers in proximity with the DIP, thus exactly as in the case of F 16 CuPc.</p><p>The threshold temperature above which the reconstruction takes place has been determined measuring the inplane structure of heterostructures grown at different temperatures. We observe the main changes at 70 ºC, at which the data actually evidence mainly the unreconstructed structure, but also a slight contribution of the reconstruction. The threshold temperature can therefore be considered 70 ºC, higher than in the case of F 16 CuPc.</p><p>Furtehrmore we would like to mention the excellent support received from the local contact Alexei Vorobiev in ID10B during the experiment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
