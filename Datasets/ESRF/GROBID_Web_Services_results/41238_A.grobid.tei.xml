<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have faced many different technical problems during the beamtime that avoid us to record useful data.</p><p>We have a first, and more important problem, in the end-station. To prepare a good Pt surface we need high temperature annealing in UHV. We were not able to arrive to 700ºC in 10-9 mbar. After this temperature, presure increases at about 10-6 mbar. Therefore was impossible to clean up the Pt surface.</p><p>However, we tried to get a clean surface, but unfortunatly, during the preparation we had to open the experimental system to repear the annealing stage. After backing out again, we had just a day for experiments. The sample preparation was quite bad, and therefore, we made smoe scans on a graphene layer with very poor order as seen in the LEED pattern.</p><p>Neverthelees we made an hk scan to explore the viability of the project, and we realized that our samle was too small for a good alignment of the diffractometer.</p><p>This figure is the only usable data we could took. Some reflections on the searched reconstruction, the (√7 x √7)R19.1º were visible, but not for the (√3 x √3)R30º, which had to appear in the shadowed area.</p></div>			</div>
