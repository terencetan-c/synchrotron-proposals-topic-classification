<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results:</head><p>The objective of the experiments was to investigate the nature of Cu complexes in H2O-Cl-S low-density high-temperature fluids, especially so as to assess whether neutral alkali complexes such as (Na,K)(Cl,S)Cu complexes can be detected with high-resolution technics. The thermodynamic properties of such complexes are well-known from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations but whether they are actually stable in natural fluids remains unknown. This in turn hinders our capacity to model Cu behavior in magmatic-hydrothermal systems and improve our understanding of the formation of porphyry/epithermal and VHMS ore deposits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and conclusions of the study:</head><p>The speciation of Cu was investigated in four different solutions: 0.15-0.82mHCl, 0.5m LiCl, 1mKCl-0.15mHCl, 1mNaCl-0.2mHCl and 7.9m LiCl-0.2mHCl. Amongst those, the pure HCl and LiCl-bearing solutions were chosen to mimic compositions that were previously investigated to high-temperature by conventional XAS and sometimes compared to theoretical XANES spectra modeled with the ab initio FDMNES code <ref type="bibr">(Brugger et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Etschmann et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fulton et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Louvel et al., 2017)</ref>. HERFD-XAS were collected up to 550°C at 60MPa at the BM16 beamline using the newly optimized autoclave of the FAME/FAME-UHD group. The high P-T HERFD-XAS measurements were conducted at the Cu K-edge (8979 eV) with a beam tuned down to 85x185 μm 2 (VxH at FWHM). HERFD-XAS were collected with 2x3 Si(444) crystal analyser spectrometer (CAS) placed under Heg atmosphere, coupled to a Vortex ® fluorescence detector for an energy resolution of 0.7-0.9 eV at 8046 eV (FWHM). In comparison to previous measurements at the Cu K-edge with 'conventional' XAS (Experimental report A30-2-1064)[1], the use of HERFD-XAS enables the identification of two features, previously unresolved under high P-T conditions: 1) a pre-edge peak centered around 8981 eV that can be attributed to the 1s → 4d transition of Cu(I); and 2) the persistence of a twocrested post-edge feature in high-temperature lowdensity fluids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This later feature had previously been attributed to the formation of CuCl2-complexes referred to as the 'La structure' in [2] in hydrothermal solutions. However, charged complexes are not expected to be stable in low-density 'gas like' fluids and we thus suggest that the 'La structure' here underlines the formation of neutral complexes where Cu is indeed associated with two chlorine atoms but also alkalis. The formation of (Li,Na,K)CuCl2 complexes under high-temperature (T&gt;450°C) is further supported by marked differences with spectra collected in 0.8m HCl, where the 'Lb</p><p>0.8m HCl 0.5m LiCl 1m KCl-0.15m HCl 1m NaCl-0.2m HCl T = 500°C P = 600 bars 1 vs. 2 Cl atoms structure' corresponding to CuCl(H2O) is clearly evidenced by a smooth and broad post-edge feature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Further EXAFS analysis is currently under way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>Our experimental results constitute the first direct evidence for the formation of neutral alkali complexes in high-temperature low-density fluids. Such complexes had previously been suggested from combined solubility experiments and MD simulations <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. Our empirical confirmation will enable modelers to confidently choose such species when simulating Cu degassing and concentration in magmatichydrothermal settings, and hence improve the simulation of ore-forming processes for porphyry and epithermal ore deposits. The success of this experiment results from efforts from the BM30/BM16 team to develop in-situ HERFD-XAS experiments. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of in-situ HERFD-XAS to probe metallic species that were previously undetectable through standard XAS measurements and pave the way towards new experiments investigating metal degassing as a function of magma composition as part of the ANR JCJC grant METGAS to Marion Louvel.</p></div>
