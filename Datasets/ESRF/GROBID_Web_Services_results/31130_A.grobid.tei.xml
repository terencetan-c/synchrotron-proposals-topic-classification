<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Metals catalysts are widely used in large-scale processes such as petroleum refining, hydrogenation of chemicals, and automobile exhaust conversion. Our group studies the physical-chemical properties of supported metal catalysts, their interaction with reactive intermediates, and relates these properties to catalytic performance. Specifically, the activity and selectivity of supported metal clusters in the hydrogenation of benzene is investigated. The intermediate product cyclohexene is a starting material for synthesis of adipic acid, nylons, polyamides, and polyesters. The selective formation of cyclohexene from benzene is more favorable that the traditional route via cyclohexane oxidation. The design of a selective catalyst is facilitated by knowledge of the hydrocarbon adsorption sites on the metal. Somorjai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have applied the sum frequency generation (SFG) technique to determine the reactive intermediates for (de)hydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbon molecules, like hexane and cyclohexene, in the presence and absence of hydrogen on Pt(111), and obtained insight into the elementary steps in the reaction mechanism. However, SFG is insensitive for the metal and the adsorption sites of the hydrocarbons remain unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Gates et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> investigated the structural changes of small metal particles, however, their detailed EXAFS-analyses do not provide information on the participating surface sites. We aim at the experimental determination of the adsorption sites for reactants and of the reactive intermediates using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In this experiment, the adsorption of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1-hexene on Pt clusters supported on Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 was studied. 2 wt% Pt/Al 2 O 3 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al 2 O 3 with an aqueous solution of tetra ammine platinum nitrate (PTA). After impregnation, the powders were dried and calcined at 673 K. 1 wt% Pt/SiO 2 was prepared by adding an aqueous solution of PTA to a slurry of SiO 2 in an NH 4 OH solution with a pH of 10. After adsorption of the PTA, the powder was filtered, washed, and dried at 373 K. The Pt catalysts were pressed in a self-supported wafer and placed in our in situ XAS cell. Prior to the XAS experiments Pt/Al 2 O 3 was reduced in pure hydrogen at 723 K and Pt/SiO 2 at 473 K. Chemisorbed hydrogen was removed by heating in vacuum (&lt;10 -3 Pa). Spectra of the Pt L 3, 2, 1 edges were collected in vacuum at room temperature. Subsequently, one the hydrocarbons was absorbed by filling the cell with He saturated with the hydrocarbon. Again, spectra of the Pt L edges were collected, at 303 and 343 K. The hydrocarbon-induced fingerprint was extracted by the following procedure: The L 2 edges were aligned on</p></div>

The difference between the L 3 edge with the adsorbed hydrocarbon and the L 3 edge collected in vacuum, is the absorbent-specific fingerprint. EXAFS fits of the L 3 EXAFS were performed in R-space with 3.2 &lt; k &lt; 12 Å -1 and 1.5 &lt; R &lt; 3.2 Å. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the Pt L 3 edges of Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Pt/SiO 2 are shown with and without adsorbed benzene, and the benzene fingerprint. The adsorption of benzene on the Pt clusters induces a change in the Pt L 3 XANES, as well as in the L 2 and L 1 XANES. From comparison of the fingerprint with calculated fingerprints for ethylene and hydrogen chemisorption, we can conclude that with increasing temperature the benzene-induced fingerprint changes towards more hydrogen. Thus, benzene dehydrogenates upon heating. On Pt/Al 2 O 3 there is more dehydrogenation than on Pt/SiO 2 . In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> the Pt L 3 edges of Pt/SiO 2 with and without adsorbed cyclohexene are shown, together with the cyclohexene fingerprint at 303 K. Cyclohexene adsorption also induces a change in the Pt L edges, which differs from the benzene-induced fingerprint. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the Pt L 3 edge of Pt/SiO 2 with and without adsorbed 1-hexene and the hexene fingerprint at 303 and 343 K.

The contracted distance does not increase significantly upon benzene adsorption, in contrast to hydrogen chemisorption, for which a bond relaxation is observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A support-oxygen contribution was included in the fits, with a coordination number of around 0.5. The Pt-Pt coordination number for Pt/SiO 2 is around 6, thus the clusters diameter is about 1 nm. The coordination number increases slightly upon adsorption of a hydrocarbon. The Pt-Pt interatomic distance in the clusters is 2.71 Å in vacuum and does not change upon adsorption.</p></div>

The shape and intensity of the hydrocarbon induced fingerprint depends on the type of adsorbed hydrocarbon, the support, and the temperature. Upon heating the hydrocarbons are dehydrogenated on Pt.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Pt L 3 edge of a.
