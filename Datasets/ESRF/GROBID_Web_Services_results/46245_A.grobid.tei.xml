<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal Summary</head><p>We wish to use XANES to investigate an unusual pressure-induced transition in a series of hexagonal perovskites. Diffraction experiments (synchrotron and neutron) show that Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 and Ba 3 BiRu 2 O 9 undergo first-order volume collapses at 5 and 10 GPa respectively, at which point Bi-O bond lengths decrease and Ir(Ru)-O bonds increase. By collecting XANES data through these transitions, we can verify that they represent the first ever observation of valence transfers between Bi and 4d or 5d transition metals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background :</head><p>The 6H-type hexagonal perovskites Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 and Ba 3 BiRu 2 O 9 first attracted interest due to their unique low-temperature spin-gap transitions, accompanied (in the case of the Ir compound) by a giant 1% negative thermal expansion. <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref> Bi has a very unusual apparent valence state of 4+ in these compounds, the instability of which appears to play a crucial role. In a diffraction experiment on ID27, we sought to investigate the ability of pressure to suppress the sin-gap transitions. In the process, we discovered that at 5.5 GPa (Ir) and 9 GPa (Ru), the volumes of these compounds collapse again by 1% in an apparently unrelated transition. In a follow-up neutron diffraction experiment on PEARL at ISIS, sufficiently precise metaloxygen bond lengths could be refined to extract bond valence sums [3] for Bi and Ir, which strongly suggest that this transition is a valence transfer: Bi 4+ + 2Ir 4+ → Bi 5+ + 2Ir 3.5+ . (See figures at right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental methods</head><p>We propose to carry out a series of XANES experiments under different external applied pressures. We will focus on the Bi L 3 -edge. As shown in the figure at right, the Bi L 3 -edge XANES spectrum of Bi 5+ species has a well-defined low energy feature (Labelled A) that corresponds to a 2p→6s transition.</p><p>[4] If valence transfer does occurs in these systems with increasing pressure, we will observe an increase in the intensity of this peak with the formation of Bi 5+ (increase in the number of unoccupied 6s states). We will also measure the Ir L 3 -edge and Ru Kedge XANES spectra. We have previously demonstrated for Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 [1] that the Ir L 3edge absorption edge energy is sensitive to the oxidation state of Ir. The Ru K-edge edge energy shows similar shifts in energy as the oxidation state of Ru changes.</p><p>[5] We anticipate decrease in the both the L 3 -edge and Ru K-edge absorption edge energy at high pressure as the valence state of Ir/Ru changes from 4+ to +3.5+.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beamline(s) and beam time requested with justification :</head><p>ID24 and BM23 are the only beamlines with the necessary energy ranges and ability to accept pressure cells (DAC or PE cell respectively). We will measure Bi L 3 -edge and Ir L 3 -edge and/or Ru K-edge XANES spectra for 3 samples: Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 , Ba 3 BiRu 2 O 9 and mixed Ba 3 BiIrRuO 9 . Spectra will be collected from 0-10 GPa in ~1 GPa steps (11 spectra per edge). Oxidation state standards (~10 samples) will be measured at ambient pressure. 2x30 min spectra will be collected from ~200 eV below to ~300 eV above the edges. Assuming we can load each sample into its own cell so that pressure changes can be carried out offline, the total time required will be 1 h * 3 samples * 11 pressures * 2.5 edges = 3.5 days, or 4 days in total including oxidation state standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results expected and their significance in the respective field of research :</head><p>Comparable pressure-induced valence transitions have only been observed in</p><p>LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 [6] (between Cu and Fe) and BiNiO 3 (between Bi and Ni). [7] Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 and Ba 3 BiRu 2 O 9 appear to be unique cases involving 4d (Ru) or 5d (Ir) transition metals. Furthermore, LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 [8] and BiNiO 3 [9] both undergo analogous lowtemperature and high-pressure transitions; whereas the low-temperature transition in Ba 3 BiIr 2 O 9 and Ba 3 BiRu 2 O 9 causes the opposite volume effect to the high-pressure one, and appears to be entirely unrelated. This is a surprising result, which we need to independently investigate and in greater detail via a high-pressure XANES experiment that can directly probe the valence states of Bi and Ir/Ru, prior to publication. 1) Miiller et al., J Am Chem Soc 134, 3265-3270 (2012). 2) Miiller et al., Phys Rev B 84, 220406R (2011). 3) Brese and O'Keeffe, Acta Cryst B 47, 192-197 (1991). 4) Jian et al.
