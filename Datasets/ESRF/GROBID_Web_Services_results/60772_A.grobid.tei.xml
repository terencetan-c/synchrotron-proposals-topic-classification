<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The family of [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]XY photosensitive complexes gave rise to the broad field of research of photo-and thermo-mechanical effects in crystals. [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 is a unique member of this family in its response to hydrostatic pressure: it undergoes a single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transition on increasing pressure. The structural distortion in the course of the phase transition was supposed to be able to affect the photoisomerization reaction [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 → [Co(NH 3 ) 5 ONO]Br 2 , i.e. transformation from nitro-to nitrito-form. The aim of this project was to test this hypothesis and compare the structures of the [Co(NH 3 ) 5 ONO]Br 2 linkage isomer: a) formed on irradiation of [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 by light at ambient pressure and then compressed in steps of ~1 GPa to 10 GPa, b) formed on irradiation of [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 by light at several pressure points before and after phase transition with ~1 GPa step up to 10 GPa.</p><p>To achieve this goal we have carried out two series of experiments. In the first series the initial nitroisomer was transformed by light from a LED into a nitrito-isomer at ambient pressure, loaded into a diamond anvil cell using neon as pressure transmitting medium and diffraction from the sample was measured starting from ambient pressure up to 10 GPa with steps ~ 0.5 GPa. The crystals were found to be highly sensitive to X-ray beam of high intensity provided bu undulator at ID15B and data collection without radiation damage of the sample was possibe only with slightly unfocused beam providing 50-60 mkm spot size at the sample instead of 10 mkm. Continuous reversible phase transition in nitrito-form of the sample on increasing pressure has been found on increasing pressure. The structure of the high-pressure phase was successfully solved and refined. In the second series of experiments we tried to transform nitro-to nitrito-form by in situ irradiation of the sample by blue LED light in diamond anvil cell at different pressures. In the first run we have increased pressure in the cell with initial [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 sample above pressure transition point and found that for high pressure phase even continuous irradiation during 8 hours does not lead to formation of nitrito-isomer which can normally be obtained in 1 hour at ambient pressure. In the second run of experiments we have found that photoisomerization process stops even at pressures lower than phase transition point. At pressures close to phase transition point irradiation by blue light was preliminary found to influence the transition pressure. This assumption will be further considered after final data reduction and analysis.</p><p>The structures of [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 and [Co(NH 3 ) 5 ONO]Br 2 were successfully solved and refined at different pressures. The results are now being analyzed and prepared for publication. The main result obtained from this experiment is a comparison of structural strain induced in the title compound by reaction initiated at high pressure, by pressure alone or by reaction alone. This will fill the gap in knowledge on the interrelation between pressure-and reaction-induced strain in the family of molecular and coordination compounds exhibiting photomechanical effects using [Co(NH 3 ) 5 NO 2 ]Br 2 as successful model.</p></div>		</body>
