<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>Smalt, a ground blue cobalt-containing potassium-based glass, was used in European painting from the middle of the 16th century. Prominent painters such as Rembrandt, Rubens, El Greco and Veronese used it frequently. First intended as a substitute for the expensive natural blue pigment ultramarine, it was soon seen to discolour in oil media. Such a discolouration can significantly influence the colour balance and therefore the complete appreciation of a painting. E.g. 'Homer'(see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), currently a fairly monochrome earth-tone painting by Rembrandt, is likely to have been painted in a much more 'regular'/colourful manner than its current state allows to assume. Since smalt is a glass-based pigment, its degradation process is similar to the degradation of historical window panes. K-leaching from inside the grain, creates a discoulered K-poor rim around a core that retains its original blue colour. It was demonstrated by Figueredo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Robinet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that this degradation process is accompagnied by the change in chemical environment of Co, namely from a tetrahedral towards an octahedral coordination. Moreover Figueredo et al. suggested that in the Co-K pre-edge two separate contributions can be distinguished at ~7709 eV and ~7712 eV of respectively Co 2+ in tetrahedral coordination and Co 2+ and Co 3+ in a octahedral coordination. The main aim of the experiment was to test if it a similar trend in the pre-edge can be seen in the degradation of smalt in paintings, in order to better understand the degradation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement/data:</head><p>A Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used, having an energy resolution (ΔE/E) of about 10 -4 . A transmission XANES spectrum of a metallic Co foil was recorded to provide an accurate energy calibration for all the recorded spectra; the first inflection point of the Co-K edge was set to 7709 eV <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. All reference materials were measured in transmission mode without focusing and with a pinhole of 200 µm, resulting in a photon flux of 9x10 9 ph/s. The thickness of all embedded smalt samples only allowed measurement in fluorescence mode with the sample oriented at 45° to the incoming beam; the fluorescence signals were collected using a Silicon Drift Detector at an angle of 45° with respect to the sample surface. KB focusing optics were used for the X-ray mapping en XANES point analysis, resulting in a spot size of 0.6 x 0.3 µm 2 (hor. x vert.) and a photon flux of 1.8x10 9 ph/s. Spectra were collected from 7.65 keV to 7.9 keV (7.65 keV -7.70 keV, 0.7 eV/step, 0.25 s/step; 7.70 keV -7.72 keV, 0.2 eV/step, 0.25 s/step; 7.72 keV -7.74 keV, 0.5 eV/step, 0.19 s/step; 7.74 keV -7.9 keV, 0.7 eV/step, 0.1 s/step). Prior to XANES point measurements, detailed X-ray maps were recorderd using step sizes down to 0.3 x 0.3 µm 2 (in general 1 x 1 µm 2 ) , with dwell times of 150 ms -600 ms, depending on the necessary resolution needed to visualise the Co present and the time needed to record the X-ray maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and progress of evaluation:</head><p>For XRF mapping, the PyMCA software package was used for the fittting of the XRF spectra. After scanning the surface of the resins with the focused x-ray beam, the X-ray fluorescence spectra of the Si drift diode array are fitted with PyMCA and the resulting elemental maps can be calculated from the fitted intensity. For the XANES measurement, a point of interest is scanned with a X-ray beam varying in energy. ROI fitting around the Co Kα line (~6.6 -7.2 keV) was performed. All acquired spectra, transmission and fluorescence, were normalised by means of the software package ATHENA. An edge-step normalization was performed by a linear pre-edge subtraction and by regression of an (in general) third degree polynomial beyond the edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Samples were analysed from several smalt containing paintings (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Amongst others, Co XANES was performed on grains of a completely decolourised (brown) sample (Rembrandt, Homer) and on blue (Van Dyck, Portrait of Quinten Simons) and dark blue grains (Holbein, Nobleman with hawk) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Prior to any XANES measurements, X-ray maps were recorded on cross-sections of embedded paint samples. In this manner smalt grains could be located, being cobalt containing potash-glass. The latter implies that during degradation, K can leach out of the glass network. Therefore the elements of interest to examine the degradation were mainly Co and K. Si-K and Pb-M maps were used to localise the grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), since often it is difficult to interpret the Co-K distribution maps due to the higher information depth. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (a-c</ref>) the visual microscopy images, as well as the elemental distribution maps of Si, K and Co (d-f) of the three described smalt grains are given. Complete and profound K-leaching can be observed in the grains of respectively the Rembrandt (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>) and Van Dyck (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>) samples, while no leaching is present in the Holbein sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). A XANES spectrum was recorded on each of the examined smalt grains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>). Degradation can be observed as a lowering of the intensity of the  shoulder at ~ 7735 eV, but more clearly as a decrease in the pre-edge intensity at ~ 7709 eV. The latter is a less sensitive to possible normalisation problems. While the spectrum of the Holbein sample in the pre-edge region still resembles that of smalt, the Rembrandt and Van Dyck sample spectra clearly show alteration. Conclusions: A large number of smalt samples from different paintings/samples and of different quality were analyzed, however the two separate contributions, suggested by Figueredo et al., at ~7709 eV and ~7712 eV of respectively Co 2+ in tetrahedral coordination and Co 2+ and Co 3+ in a octahedral coordination, were not found. It was therefore not possible (yet) to quantify the degree of degradation by e.g. the relative intensities of both contributions. Only the general trends found by Robinet et al. were observed. a b c f d e g</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Homer (Rembrandt, 1663;Mauritshuis, Den haag, NL)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,442.20,420.75,112.30,149.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>
