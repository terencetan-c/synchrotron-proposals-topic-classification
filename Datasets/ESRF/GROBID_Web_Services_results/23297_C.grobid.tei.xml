<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The experiments reported here are part of a long term project (Palancher's PhD) dedicated to the methodological study by anomalous diffraction of the precise location of cations in zeolites in the presence of multi-component adsorbed phases. The industrial and scientific background is based on optimisation and development of new molecular sieves (such as X, Y or A zeolites) for high performance processes for separation and purification of hydrocarbon isomers. In such molecular sieves, adsorption properties and, more precisely, selectivity and capacity of adsorption can be correlated with the distribution of charge compensating cations. Preliminary measurements performed at room temperature, with pre-treated (dehydrated) samples (SrX and SrRbX) sealed in capillary holders (state 1) have shown the strong sensitivity of AWAXS to the distributions of cations (Sr 2+ and Sr 2+ or Rb + respectively) (see ref.</p><p>[1] and <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>). Moreover an appropriate analytical method (optimisation of the beam optics, the data collection strategy and the detection system) has been established. The aim of this experiment was to study in situ the evolution of the cation distribution in the same samples (SrX and SrRbX) under various hydration and temperature conditions as well as the validation of the experimental set-up. 12 shifts on BM2 were allocated by the CRG Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental set-up</head><p>In order to control the composition of the atmosphere surrounding the sample and its temperature, a cell (based on ref. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>) has been designed and built. The sample, in a quartz glass capillary, was kept fixed by two glass wool plugs, to avoid sample displacements during gas circulation. The capillary was mounted between two Swagelock Tees using graphite ferrules for good tightness. The Tees were screwed onto an aluminium support placed on a sliding block. Aluminium tubing (1/16 in.) connected Swagelock fittings to gas admission or extraction. The whole cell was mounted on standard goniometer head. Thanks to a motor (not represented in figure1) placed behind goniometer head, oscillations of approximately ±55° (° 2θ) could be used to maximise the number of crystallites orientations sampled. The heating system consisted of an hot air blower placed close to the sample capillary. Temperatures up to 210°C in the capillary could be reached. The temperature gradient is less than 5% over a 2 mm zone along the capillary whereas the synchrotron beam width could be evaluated to 1 mm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffraction experiments</head><p>In these experiments, SrX and SrRbX (with equal numbers of Sr 2+ and Rb + cations) were analysed. Two different parameters (temperature and degree of hydration of the flushing gas) can influence the rate of hydration of the sample. Four experimental conditions have been chosen : 1. Hydrated at room temperature and no flushing gas (state 2) 2. T : Room temperature and as received N 2 (as flushing gas) (state 3) 3. T : Room temperature and N 2 dried by use of a moisture filter (as flushing gas) (state 4) 4. T = 210°C and N 2 dried by use of a moisture filter (as flushing gas) (state 5).</p><p>Comparing data from the sample with a high degree of hydration (state 2, DRX laboratory data) and a low degree of hydration (state 1), reflections which are very sensitive to hydration were identified. Their evolution during the dehydration process enabled us to assess that an equilibrium state had been reached. The dehydration from state 2 to state 5 on SrX and from state 2 to 3 on SrRbX have been studied. In spite of the presence of water molecules in the zeolite framework which could be located near cationic sites in high symmetric positions (on [111] axes) (see ref. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>), the anomalous effect is strong enough to be able to locate both cations, even in the most hydrated state (state 3). The sample SrRbX has been studied in state 2 at 5 energies in order to quantitatively evaluate data quality. Due to time limitations, data at 3 energies were collected for SrRbX in state 3 and SrX in the states 4 and 5. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> points out the efficiency of the in situ cell in obtaining samples (SrX in this case) with modified degrees of hydration. Several stable intermediate states have been identified and the influence of Rb + on the behaviour of Sr 2+ cations has been clearly observed.    0 4000 8000 12000 16000 0 , 2 0 , 2 4 0 , 2 8 0 , 3 2 s=1/d (Å-1) Intensity (a.u.)
