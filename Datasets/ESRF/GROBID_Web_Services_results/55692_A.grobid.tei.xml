<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Outline An in situ investigation using Quick EXAFS on BM26A was proposed to track the solvothermal decomposition reactions of iron tris-diisobutyl dithiocarbamate. This class of reaction is a popular synthesis technique for the formation of mono-disperse sulphide nanoparticles. While previous experiments have allowed us to uncover the precursor decomposition process, recent developments in in situ liquid cell design have allowed access to higher temperatures and therefore new information at the crystallisation stage of the reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell Design</head><p>Beamline staff worked closely with Sample Environment to develope a liquid cell based on an existing cell used for pellets. The existing cell, known as the Microtron, is designed for optimum heat transfer to the sample to reduce temperature gradients and maintain temperature accuracy. The aim for the beamtime was to produce a vessel as an attachment to the furnace that could hold liquids. The most challenging aspect was choosing window materials that could be used for iron K-edge transition measurements at high temperatures. Kapton becomes soft and bulged after 150 o C. Mica has higher glass transition and melting temperatures and thin windows can be made at 50μm width for optimum transmission, but mica contains iron impurities. The final choice in window material was quartz of 100μm widthalthough during the experiment these were swapped for the far cheaper glass windows of the same width, owing to breakages. The windows decrease transmission to 7% only at the iron K-edge which has meant slightly poorer data quality than with thinner windows. The glue holding windows to the aluminium frame is cement glue which has melting temperature of 270 o C. The cell has two holes at the top which can be screwed closed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Decomposition of nickel diisobutyl dithiocarbamate in the presence of a coordinating solvent to nickel sulphide, was previously investigated by us. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Although the process of decomposing transition metal dithiocarbamate complexes to form nanoparticulate sulphides is well known and used frequently, the decomposition mechanism was previously little understood. We showed that the presence of a coordinating solvent was vital for the decomposition process to occur. We also postulated the nucleation process. Iron diisobutyl dithiocarbamate decomposition results in the formation of nanoparticulate iron sulphidesthese are far more relevant in the area of catalysis and goochemistry but the complexity of the system means that the decomposition is far more difficult to understand mechanistically. In previous beamtimes allocated by NWO, the decompositions were, like in the nickel case, shown to be crucially reliant on the coordinating solvent. Here, the various iron dithiocarbamate reactions were performed up to 260 o C, and the final structure was finally observed, providing new insight into structure determination from the reaction process. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> below shows, for example, the formation of FeS2 pyrite, which was formed from the decomposition of a iron diisobutyl dithiocarbamate in oleylamine in high concentrations at about 220 o C. The full decomposition process shows four stages of decomposition and sulphide formation. Interestingly, the reaction process does not go through a less thermodynamically stable sulphide intermediate phase as originally thought. Rather, pyrite is suddenly formed at 220 o C. This strongly suggests that the process of pyrite formation is not simply thermodynamically motivated one, and there are other factors at play, possibly including the large excess of the ligand in the reaction mixture which may act as a sulphur source. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results of this beamtime have enabled us to further understand reaction mechanisms of a highly relevant and widely used reaction process. Results can help to tailor the process of synthesising exotic phases of sulphide material, and in the short term add to the understanding of a series of material syntheses. Before publication of these results, the full EXAFS analysis of the intermediate stages of the decomposition must be performed, and supporting characterisation techniques must be used in order to add merit to our findings which have largely only been observed by XAS owing to the nature of the system. Our aim is also to understand other single source precursor materials and their interaction with solvents and effects of reaction conditions inluding the reaction that forms molybdenum disulphidea material used widely as engine lubricants in the fuel industry, and cadmium sulphide quantum dots, used as photodetectors and fluorescence probes.</p><p>1.
