<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>Chronic renal failure is associated with a strong increase in cardiovascular risk, which is responsible for approximately 50 % of the mortality in the hemodialysis population. Increased vascular calcification is a prominent feature of vascular disease in uremic patients. In recent years, the insight has emerged that ectopic calcification is a tightly regulated process, and results from an imbalance between inhibitors (such as fetuin and matrix Gla protein) and inducers of mineralisation (such as elevated phosphate levels). Several recent studies indicate that cultured vascular smooth muscle cells can undergo major phenotypical changes under the influence of elevated extracellular phosphate levels. This so-called osseous metaplasia is parallel to the bone formation process and characterised by: (i) expression of osteoblast-specific differentiation markers; (ii) deposition of bone matrix proteins ; (iii) loss of the vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation marker α-smooth muscle actin; (iv) the deposition of mineral. Although the mechanisms and mediators of vascular calcification in chronic renal failure are the topics of recent challenging research, the identity of the mineral phase formed in this context remains uncertain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>To further elucidate the mechanism of uremia-related vascular calcification, two complementary experimental models of uremia-related vascular calcification were developed, in which vessel calcification was induced in rats with chronic renal failure by (i) phosphate suppletion and (ii) vitamin D treatment. Additionally, mineralization was induced in primary cultures of human vascular smooth muscle cells by exposing these cells to (i) elevated phosphate levels, (ii) bone morphogenetic protein type 2 (BMP-2). Given the small sample sizes of (i) rat aorta with 100 µm wall thickness which is merely partially calcified (estimated thickness of the mineralised zone: 5-20 µm), (ii) vascular smooth muscle cell cultures in which only a fraction of cells undergoes mineralisation, techniques with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution are needed to enable mineral identification. In this context, the micro-diffraction set-up of the ID18F beam line (beam spot size applied: 2x10 µm) meet the requirements to successfully identify the mineral phase present in these samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Vitamin D induced vascular calcification</head><p>In this model of uremia induced vascular calcification based on the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) three different situations were found. In some animals, a calcium-phosphorus containing precipitate was present in which no mineral phase could be identified using XRD (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), hereby indicating the presence of an amorphous phase. In other animals the precipitate was identified as poorly crystalline apatite (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) while in a third group the mineral consisted of two phases: poorly crystalline apatite and whtilockite (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phosphate induced vascular calcification</head><p>Micro-X-ray diffraction analysis of embedded sections of calcified aorta from chronic renal failure rats placed on a high phosphorus diet revealed the mineral to be hydroxyapatite. In this model, no phases other than poorly crystalline apatite were found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mineralized human smooth muscle cell cultures</head><p>The mineral deposited in human vascular smooth muscle cells upon treatment with high phosphate concentrations was shown to be poorly crystalline apatite. No other mineral phases were detected.
