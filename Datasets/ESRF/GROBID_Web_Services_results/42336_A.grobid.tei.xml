<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experiment:</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to do a series of scans at medium and high resolution, i.e. with a voxel size ranging between 7.46 and 0.678!m to compare the microanatomical organization between regions with and without muscle attachment. During this first scan session, we decided to focus on the areas free of muscle attachment. It is necessary to understand first the 3D microanatomical and histological organization in regions where there is no biomechanical constraints to properly analyse that kind of disturbance then.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results:</head><p>Thanks to this scan session we were able to visualize and describe the dermal bone growth of early gnathostomes in three dimensions. It seems that dermal bone organization has been greatly conserved in the evolutionary history of jawed vertebrates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Its pattern could therefore be a great source of information for understanding the evolution of the different models of bone ossifications we know today. In order to confirm (or not) these preliminary hypotheses, we plan to image more dermal bones among other species of placoderms at different ontogenetic stages. These scans should be done in July 2012 during the second session of the experiment EC-770.</p></div>

Ahlberg. 2011. 3D Bone microstructures of the placoderm Compagopiscis (Gogo formation, Australia) revealed by Synchrotron virtual palaeohistology. 13 th Conference on Australasian Vertebrate Evolution Palaeontology and Systematics, Perth (Australia).</p><p>Usually only the teeth and bones (and other hard tissues) of animals are preserved as fossils and accessible for palaeontological studies. This mode of preservation has necessitated that palaeontologists use a comparative anatomical approach to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships or infer palaeobiological reconstructions. Until recently, supplementary microanatomical and histological information could only be obtained by sectioning fossil bones (e.i. in an irreversible destructive way). Today, we show that phase-contrast based synchrotron virtual palaeohistology not only allows the preservation of the fossils from any mechanical or chemical damage, but it also reveals the 3D architecture of fossil bone tissue up to the micron scale.</p><p>Within the framework of understanding the early evolution of bone tissues throughout gnathostomes, we present here results on the Australian placoderm Compagopiscis croucheri (Frasnian). The 3D organization of the vascular network and bone cells clearly shows three distinct layers: the external layer presents a lamellar structure with aligned cell lacunae parallel to the surface of the bone; the middle core is cancellous and presents a lamellar circumferential structure; the innermost layer progressively transits towards a horizontal lamellar structure. The discontinuity between the 3D architectures of the external layer and the cancellous core indicates the operation of two distinct processes of growth, which could not have been distinguished from observations of 2D thin sections. These preliminary observations suggest that previous models of dermal bone growth in gnathostomes require to be deeply modified.</p><p>Not only informative on bone growth, synchrotron approach also allows a better understanding of the nature of soft tissue attachments (e.g., direct muscle attachment, tendon) and the orientation of their anchorage. Based on such 3D data in the branchial area of Compagopiscis croucheri, we have been able to determine the location of at least two muscles: one inserted on the ventral part of the gill skeleton (basibranchial complex, hypobranchials or hypohyals) and another one probably inserted on the posterior part of the ceratohyal or on the ceratobranchials.</p><p>Based on these preliminary results, synchrotron virtual palaeohistology promises to be a powerful tool for a better understanding of bone histology and palaeobiological reconstructions of soft tissues.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A-C, 3D models of dermal bone vascularization in the tetrapod (sarcopterygian) Rattus (A), the actinopterygian Polypterus (B), and the placoderm Compagopiscis (C).
