The capsids of small RNA phages have T=3 symmetry and can be regarded as built up from 90 dimers.</p><p>The three dimensional structures of several small RNA phages, including MS2, Qb, fr, Ga and PP7 have been determined earlier.</p><p>Bacteriophage AP205 infects Acinetobacter bacteria and its coat protein has no detectable similarity to that of other small RNA phages. In contrast to other small RNA phage capsids, which always have T=3 symmetry, recombinant AP205 capsids may have either T=1 or T=3 symmetry. About 80-90 % of particles from the same preparation have T=3 symmetry, while remaining 10-20% have T=1 symmetry. So far it has proved to be impossible to separate particles of both sizes.</p><p>In this experiment we collected a 4.0 Ã… dataset of recombinant AP205 capsid crystals. According to cell dimensions, crystals were built exclusively of T=1 particles, which was somewhat surprising, since material for crystallization consists mainly of T=3 particles. At the moment, structure determination is in progress.</p></div>			</div>
