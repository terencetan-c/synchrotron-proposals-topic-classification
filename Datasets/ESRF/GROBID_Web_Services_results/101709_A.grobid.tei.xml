<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Experimental setup. The sample is excited by an 800 nm laser at normal incidence. X-rays with 18 keV photon energy comes in with about 0.3 degree grazing angle. The WAXS pattern is collected by a detector.</p><p>A typical scan is performed in the following way: First, we collect several X-ray diffraction patterns of the cold (crystalline) sample. Then, we deliver 10 laser shots onto the sample. This is because the degree of amorphization was observed to increase significantly with the number of laser shots, up to about 10 shots. The same phenomenon was also observed by Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. After the laser shots, we collect X-ray diffraction patterns at regular intervals, typically every 5 s. We observe that the sample re-crystallizes gradually and nearly returns to its original state after sufficient wait time.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows more details on the recrystallization process using wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Panel A shows the azimuthally integrated diffraction data, ùêº(ùëÑ). From dark red to dark blue, the curves show increasing delay after the laser shots when the X-ray diffraction pattern is taken. The curves almost overlap because the differences between them are very small. These differences become clearer when the diffraction pattern from the cold crystalline sample is subtracted, as shown in panel B. In particular, in the diffraction pattern immediately after the laser shots (dark red), there is a clear increase of a broad feature spanning 1 to 3 √Ö -1 , as well as a clear decrease in the crystalline peak slightly below 2 √Ö -1 . This indicates that the sample is partially amorphized by the laser shots. With increasing delay time (from red to blue in the plot), these two features gradually decrease in amplitude, and the ùêº(ùëÑ) curve recovers its original value.</p><p>We also analyze quantitatively the evolution as a function of time, as shown in panels C and D. The former shows the change in the intensity of the crystalline peak (slightly below 2 √Ö -1 ) and the latter the change in the intensity of the amorphous feature, both with respect to the cold diffraction data. These time-dependence data can be well described by an exponential decay function fit, as indicated by the red dashed lines. The extracted decay time constant, ùúè 0 , is about 90 s.</p><p>We note that similar re-crystallization results have been observed by Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> using laser reflectivity measurements, although the time constant ùúè 0 is slightly shorter. Our structural measurement results confirm the interpretation of Cheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, because the amorphization is only partial and the crystalline peaks are intense, as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A-B</ref>, the extracted amorphous signal is strongly influenced by the tails of the crystalline peaks, especially at high ùëÑ. This problem could not be resolved by changing the fluence of the 800 nm laser. Therefore, we have not been able to obtain detailed structural information on the amorphous phase. Future experiments with a different setup design are necessary to achieve the original goal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Partial amorphization and re-crystallization of Te at 253 K. (A) Azimuthally integrated diffraction intensity, ùêº(ùëÑ); from dark red to dark blue, the curves show increasing delay up to ~300 s after the laser shot. The curves almost all overlap. (B) Same as A but subtracting ùêº(ùëÑ) of the cold (crystalline) data taken before the laser shot. With increasing delay, the amorphous feature decreases and the crystalline peak recovers. (C) Change in the Te peak intensity compared with the cold shot. (D) Change in the amorphous intensity comapred with the cold shot. The red dashed lines in C and D indicate fits with an exponential decay function.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,53.05,359.94,482.65,348.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
