<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We are going to summarize the results obtained in experiment Results:</p><p>-Ferredoxin NADP(H) reductase (FNR) from Anabaena in reduced state: We managed to get diffraction data at 2 Å from a FNR monocrystal, previously reduced under anaerobic conditions with DTT . X data images have been processed by XDS and MR and refinement is taking place at home. Soon, we plan to solve the structure of the reduced enzyme. FNR crystals belonged to the P6 5 hexagonal space group. At present we are carrying out new trials of crystallisation of FNR in semiquinone and reduced state in order to get more insights into the conformation changes that must take place during redox reactions. Also, another Xray data collection was obtained from a mutant of FNR at 1.5 Å and then processed by XDS.</p><p>-FAD synthetase: Crystals of FAD synthetase from Streptococcus pneumoniae complexed with the cofactor FAD did not diffract well and no good datasets could be obtained. Crystals seem not to be good enough for getting high resolution. More screenings have been proved in presence of reducing agents in order to decrease the oligomerization degree that has been observed in this FAD synthase.</p><p>-Apoptosis Induction Factor (AIF): X diffraction data from crystals of human AIF in complex with NADH were collected up to 2.85 Å of resolution. They were processed and the solved structure shows the position of the coenzyme NADH in the active site. The structure is going to be included in a manuscript that is being writing. This structure is going to increase the knowledge of complex formation and residues that are critical in the enzyme activity. A AIF mutant crystal was also diffracted up to 2 Å and processed by XDS.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We tested crystals of POFUT1 with EGF12 but unfortunately for us we could not get any complexes of the crystals. We only got the apo POFUT1 structure in all the diffracted crystals. We are currently trying to get new conditions. We could not test all the different crystals we brought because we had problems with the sample changer and therefore we will need to go to the ESRF with the same crystals and hopefully with new crystal forms.</p></div>			</div>
