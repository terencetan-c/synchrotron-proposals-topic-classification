<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main objective of the project was to utilize in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in order to provide a fundamental understanding of the complex changes occurring in the geometric and local electronic structures for electrocatalysts active for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). The electrocatalyst material of primary interest consisted of MoOx nanoparticles supported on an iron and nitrogen-doped carbon support (MoOx@FeNC), which represents a promising catalyst for the electro-reduction of NO3 -to NH3. During this measurement time we investigated the roles the Fe and Mo active sites by closely monitoring the electronic state and local geometric structure under NO3RR operating conditions (i.e. as a function of the applied electrochemical potential and the electrolyte pH). Our state-of-the-art molybdenum dendrite catalyst supported on Ni form (Mo@NiF) was measured in a similar manner in order to identify the changes in the Mo oxidation state and local structure that occur during NO3RR. In addition, a series of synthetic Fe-S clusters, which mimic the Fe-S cubane active centers in complex enzymatic systems (e.g. in nitrogenases that reduce N2 to NH3), were also measured ex situ in order to reveal changes in the formal oxidation state and coordination environment of Fe that occur as the ligand environment is varied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of the measurement/data</head><p>In situ XAS spectra were obtained in fluorescence mode at the Fe K-edge for our MoOx@FeNC material under NO3RR conditions (k-range ca. &gt;8 Å -1 ). Similarly, in situ measurements at the Mo K-edge for our MoOx@FeNC and Mo@NiF catalysts yielded k-ranges of 10 Å -1 and 12.5 Å -1 , respectively. In all cases, clear changes in the XAS spectra related to the activity of the electrochemical reaction under investigation can be observed, indicating that our spectro-electrochemical flow cell worked as intended and that our materials were well-suited for in situ XAS analysis. Some difficulty measuring at high overpotentials was encountered due to the simultaneous production of H2 bubbles at the working electrode, which causes changes in the beam attenuation and therefore fluctuations in the measured signal. In addition to in situ measurements, several molecular Fe-S catalyst complexes were measured ex situ at the Fe K-edge. High quality XAS spectra (k-range ca. &gt;12 Å -1 ) were obtained in transmission mode for the Fe-S clusters, which allowed for a detailed XANES and EXAFS analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The in situ XAS spectra for the MoOx@FeNC catalyst in acidic media are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Compared here are the Fe K-edge and Mo K-edge spectra for the catalyst under blank conditions (0.05 M H2SO4) and NO3RR conditions (0.05 M H2SO4 + 0.1 M NaNO3). All polarization measurements were conducted by stepping the electrode potential cathodically from the OCP (e.g. 300 mV) to ca. -500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, where the NO3RR is known to take place. From Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, we observe that no reduction of the Fe center occurs as the potential is reduced from OCP to NO3RR conditons. This is in contrast to our previous results for the bare FeNC material (i.e. without MoOx nanoparticles), which showed strong changes in the absorption edge related to the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ (see Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> insert for comparison). The FT-EXAFS show that the amplitude of the first coordination shell, which can be attributed to the 4 nearest neighboring nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin site, generally increases as the potential is decreased. This likely indicates an increase of the coordination number, which may be related to adsorption of oxo species (e.g. from water) or sulfate (e.g. from the electrolyte) to the surface under blank conditions or the adosrption of nitrate under NO3RR conditions. This result is also in contrast to our previous results obtained on the pure FeNC material, where we observed a strong decrease in amplitude as the potential was decreased under both blank and NO3RR conditions (see Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> insert for comparison to FeNC).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>-d show the in situ Mo K-edge spectra for MoOx@FeNC in acidic media. Similar to the Fe K-edge, we observe no major shifts in the edge position, indicating that Mo does not experience a strong reduction upon polarization. Using a series of Mo standards, it was determined that Mo resides in an average oxidation state of 1.4, suggesting that the MoOx nanoparticles likely contain a metallic Mo core and an oxide surface. This is further supported by comparing the FT-EXAFS of MoOx@FeNC to the measured Mo standards in Figure <ref type="figure">1d</ref>. Overall, the FT-EXAFS show little change during the first few potential steps (i.e. from 300 to -300 mV). At -500 mV, however, the FT-EXAFS spectra show dramatic changes that suggest a restructuring of the catalyst under NO3RR conditions. Although further fitting of the Mo K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra is needed, the lack of any major changes in the Fe K-edge data suggets that MoOx has a signficant influence on the NO3RR mechanism in acidic media. Specifically, the presence of MoOx seems to inhibit the reduction of Fe under NO3RR conditions and may be the preferred active site at the potentials examined.</p><p>In situ XAS measurements of the MoOx@FeNC catalyst were also performed in neutral media (0.05 M Na2SO4). Shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> are the XANES and FT-EXAFS spectra at the Fe K-edge (Figure <ref type="figure">2a-b</ref>) and Mo K-edge (Figure <ref type="figure">2c-d</ref>). Similar to the case in acidic media, we observe no shifts in the absorption edge position at either K-edge, indicating that neither Fe nor Mo experience a signficant change in electronic state under electrocatalytic conditions. Interestingly, the FT-EXAFS spectra also suggets that there is no signficant change in the local structure. These results tend to suggest that the NO3RR may proceed through a separate mechanism in neutral media in which there is no specific adsorption of NO3 - at the potentials we examined (e.g. outer sphere reaction mechanism).</p><p>Analysis of the in situ data for our state-of-the-art Mo@NiF catalysts is still in progress. The in situ XANES spectra recorded in neutral media (Na2SO4) suggest that the Mo sites initially exist in a Mo 3+ state, which is then reduced to Mo 2+ under NO3RR conditions. Furthermore, strong structural changes are observed in the FT-EXAFS spectra. A large increase in the first coordination shell and the appearance of strong features at r values &gt;3 suggest that the structure becomes more ordered as the potential is decreased into the NO3RR regime, which may be essential to high catalytic activity and selectivity that we have observed with this material.</p><p>Finally, we systematically investigated the room temperature XAS spectra of the synthetic iron-sulfur cubanes, Kn[Fe4S4(DmpS)4] (where n=0-4) (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). This was part of a larger spectroscopic study involving a large array of magnetic and electronic techniques techniques (SQUID, Mössbauer, EPR, UV-Vis). From the XANES spectra shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>, we can identify systematic changes in the absorption edge energy as well as the line shape that are caused by changes in oxidation state and the coordination sphere form distorted tetrahedral to tetrahedral, respectively. While these changes are well documented by our previous single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, 1-14 ( <ref type="formula">2022</ref>)), they are also supported by our analysis of the EXAFS region of the spectrum in Figure <ref type="figure">3c</ref>. We expect that this analysis and our corresponding documentation of the XAS Fingerprint of these cubanes will enable biochemists to identify the oxidation state of biological Fe4S4 cofactors using synchrotrom techniques with higher certainty and ease, since, in contrast to the usually performed Mössbauer spectroscopy, no isotopic enrichment of the protein by 57 Fe is necessary to measure the spectrum. We are currently planning future studies to investigate the so-called "ligand XAS spectra" of our Fe4S4 complexes, since XANES Fingerprints measured at the S K-edge have been used to gauge the contributions of superand double-exchange to valence delocalization in these systems in the past (J. Am. <ref type="bibr">Chem. Soc. 126, 8320-8328 (2004)</ref>). We hope that this will also enable us to understand even better their fundamental electronic structure and reveal which oxidation states are dominated by super-and which by double-exchange.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,145.25,379.52,328.48,339.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
