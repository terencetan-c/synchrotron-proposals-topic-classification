<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective &amp; expected results (less than 10 lines): GIXRD measurements of GaAs nanowires (100, 80, 60, 40 nm nominal diameters) in 4x4 mm 2 arrays, 1 Âµm spacing between NWs. The four sample are realized by IBM Resarch-Zurich. The Si NW seed is obtained by ICP etchning (from Si(111) substrate) GaAs grows outside the Si NW template. Study of GaAs internal strain: in-plane and out-of-plane measurement. Determination of an interfacial dislocation network in-between Si and GaAs materials inside the wires. Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained by fitting with Gaussian function for large large index reflections:</head><p>The structures are therfore mostly relaxed in the plane even for large diameters.</p><p>During the second part of the experiments, we focussed on the analysis of dislocation peaks. Data are under treatment but we think that we have a signature of the periodicity of the misfit dislocation by the presence of 0 th -order satalletite and its FWHM value. Other order measurements are limited by the very low intensity of the superlattice peaks and by the choice of the reflection.</p><p>Out-of-plane measurements: ! The incidence angle must be smaller that the critical angle to avoid refraction effects (see example below). ! 0.03 deg is chosen in these measurements. We are close to transmission. ! We measure l-scan starting from (h0 k0) in-plane values. ! Deformation are directly extracted from the positions. Refraction effects measured in the CTR: Example of ( X Y l) with l=8.2 and two incidence angles. Examples of CTRs sensitive or not sensitive to stacking faults.</p><p>! Ratio between experimental and theoretical values are again very close ! The strain state is almost completely relaxed in this type of structures.</p><p>Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.):</p><p>Very successful experiment. The beam intensity was too limited to measure in details the dislocation network, but most of the goals of th eproposal have been reached.</p></div>

Si peaks have integer indexes. In-plane measurements: ! No difficulties to have the GIXRD signal for the small GaAs NWs. ! Wavelength: 0.6888 A, Measurements at two Incidences 0.03 and 0.1 deg. ! Standard epitaxial relationship demonstrated by (H00), (0K0), (HK0) scans in the Si reciprocal lattice unit. ! Estimation of in-plane strain relaxation. ! -The in-plane lattice parameter is directly obtained from the peak positions (higher sensibility at higher orders) ! -The shape function is mainly visible for 40 nm. It can be analyzed quantitatively to get the sizes. Example: Choice of incidence with 60 nm sample: GaAs NW signal is max for 0.1 deg. For 0.03 deg, we are less sensitive to the Si signal, which has 2 contributions: bulk and template.</figDesc></figure>
