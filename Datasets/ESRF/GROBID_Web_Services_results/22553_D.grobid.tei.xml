<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of experiment HE1263 was to measure the pressure induced valence change of some Yb and Eu compounds by high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. We were able to measure most of the proposed compounds, i.e. Yb metal, YbAl 2 , YbS and EuS. We have already submitted the experimental report with the results on YbAl 2 (which have now been published <ref type="bibr">[Ref. 1]</ref>). The present report is about results on YbS. YbS is known from compressibility data and optical reflectivity measurements to undergo a progressive rearrangement of the electronic structure starting at around 100 kbar. The valence was correspondingly estimated by L 3 X-Ray Absorption to change from 2 (at ambient pressure) to 2.5 at 300 kbar <ref type="bibr">[Ref. 2]</ref>. The large lifetime broadening of L 3 XAS leaves some uncertainties about these values. By performing Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Emission (RXES) measurements at the same edge, as a function of the incident and emitted energy, we could evaluate much more precisely the change in the electronic structure. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows Partial Fluorescence Yield (PFY) spectra: the Lα 1 (3d-2p) decay channel is recorded while scanning hν IN across the L 3 edge. Two peaks arise in the spectrum due to the different Coulomb interaction of the Yb 2+ and Yb 3+ ions with the 3d core-hole present in the final state of the process. The change in the relative weight of the two peaks is the indicator of the progressive valence change. In order to extract the valence value, the spectra were fitted at each pressure by two line shapes representing the two different valence contributions. The typical quality of the fit of given in the lower panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Thanks to the good contrast of the PFY spectra it is possible to reveal also the different line width of the two spectral components. This is a fingerprint of the different spread of the atomic multiplet structure, which remains visible in this rather ionic compound.</p><p>1.52 1.53 1.54 1.55 Yb 3+ Yb 2+ 160 kbar Energy transfer (keV) YbS Lα 1 RXES 50 kbar 8.94 8.95 8.96 PFY Photon energy (keV) Fig. 2.

Spectra were measured at several incident energies across the L 3 threshold (dots in the inset). The spectra plotted with thick lines are taken at the resonance of Yb 2+ and Yb 3+ . The series of spectra taken at the different pressures have been decomposed in their divalent and trivalent component. In the fitting procedure the presence of fluorescent emission (at constant outgoing energy) must be taken into account as soon as the 2+ resonance is crossed. The valence value was again calculated as v = 2 + I 2+ /( I 2+ + I 3+ ), I 2+ and I 3+ being the intensity values of each component at its resonance. As a third way to extract the valence we took advantage of RXES spectra measured with incident energy well below the L 3 absorption threshold. The analysis is more straightforward since no fluorescent component is present yet, and the trivalent component is better seen because the divalent resonance is still far. Of course these spectra are less intense and corrections due to the different distance from the resonances of the two components can be needed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> shows these low intensity spectra at different pressures. With normalization to the divalent peak, the intensity of the trivalent component indicates the valence change.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> summarizes the different valence estimates: the spread of these values gives the residual uncertainty, which is less than 0.05.</p><p>The discussed results have been submitted to Physical Review B. 0 100 200 300 400 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 valence p (kbar) </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.
