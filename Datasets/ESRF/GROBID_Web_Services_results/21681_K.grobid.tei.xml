<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ines Li De La Sierra, Nicolas Leuliot (2 shifts) : yeast S. cerevisiae Structural Genomics project</head><p>The systematic names of the genes are used. More details on every orf can be found on <ref type="url" target="http://genomics.eu.org/targets.html">http://genomics.eu.org/targets.html</ref> 1 ) YGR205w (target 43) Spacegroup P43212 a=65.2 c=140.6 Resolution 2.15 A Completion= 98% R-fact = 0.089</p><p>The structure of this protein was previously solved by MAD data obtained from Se-Met crystals. The structure revealed an unexpected strong resemblance to a structure of a known enzyme. Se-Met protein crystallized in this case more easily than the native protein, and structure determination was in this case well ahead of native data collection. Considerable effort was put into the crystallization of the native protein. The refinement of the 2.1A data is underway. Cocrystallization with potential substrates proved also very difficult. Data collected in presence of nucleotides did not reveal any bound in the active site.</p><p>2) YER010c (target 154) Spacegroup C2 a=114.9, b=132.97, c=48.6, β=97.23 RESOLUTION = 2.2 A This protein is of unknown structure and function. Crystals of the Se-Met substituted protein were obtained under the same crystallization conditions as the native protein. Analysis of the fluorescence scan spectrum revealed that Se was partially oxidised in the crystals. Data were therefore collected at 4 different wavelengths The protein contains only two methionines for 234 residues and the corresponding anomalous signal was too weak to determine protein phases. Site directed mutagenesis is carried out to incorporate more methionines into the protein.</p><p>3) YDR435c ( target 182) Spacegroup P6122 or P6522 a=112.7 c= 162.7 RESOLUTION = 2.3 A This orf codes for a N-terminal methyl transferase involved in the regulation of a phosphatase complex. A four wavelength data set was collected on the Se-met substituted crystals. The protein contains 14 methionines and phasing is underway. Complete data sets on the native protein with and without a potential cosubstrate have also been collected. In year 2000, a first native data set had been collected on ID14-1 of 24/02/00 to 2.8Å resolution with crystals of the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P. A MAD data set collected on ID14-4 of 22/09/00 using the selenomethionine modified form of the protein allowed us to solve the first structure of HprK/P.</p></div>

PDB ID code: 1jb1</head><p>Latter on, a data set collected on ID14-1 of 07/04/02 allowed us to solve by molecular replacement the structure of the complex between the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P and B. subtilis HPr.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieulaine et al. (2002) PNAS, (accepted) PDB ID code: 1kkm</head><p>The 14/09/02 on ID14-4 we also collected the first data of the complex between HPr and HprK/P in presence of the allosteric effector fructose-1, 6 bisphosphate (FBP). The crystals diffracted to 2.5Å resolution but the both data sets were incomplete and the resulting density was of bad quality.</p><p>During this run, we collected two data sets to 3.5Å resolution with a new crystal form of the complex with the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P in presence of FBP. These new data helped us to improve our model of the allosteric transition induced by FBP in HprK/P but we need higher resolution to describe its interaction mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deoxyribose-induced protein (Deox):</head><p>DeoX, a protein from Salmonella typhimurium, is possibly related to the growth of the bacteria when deoxyribose is the only source of carbon in the medium. Structure and function of this protein were unknown. We collected a native dataset on the beamline BM14. Crystals diffracted to 2.4 A resolution in space group P2 1 . Because the aminoacid sequence of DeoX shared no homology with anything known, we decided to solve its structure by MAD phasing. A good dataset could be collected on the beamline BM30A (FIP) at 2.6 A resolution in space group P2 1 . However, the low symmetry and the high number of Se atom in the asymetric unit (90) did not allow us to find good position of the Se sites and therefore solve the structure (neither with SOLVE, SnB nor ShelxD). Recently, a function of deoxyribose mutarotase has been attributed to the enzyme. The only known structure of a mutarotase is the galactose mutarotase from E. coli. Molecular replacement with this model was not successful. We found different crystallisation conditions, where the ASU only contained 2 monomers in the P321 space group. A MAD dataset has been collected on the ID14-4 with these crystals. Diffraction patterns reached 2.2 A reolution. But the 30 sites were not found because this time, merohedral twinnng occured (twin fraction of 22%) and the anomalous signal was lost.</p></div>			</div>
