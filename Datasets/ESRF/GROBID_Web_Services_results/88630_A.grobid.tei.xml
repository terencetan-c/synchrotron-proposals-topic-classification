<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the experiment CH5490, we investigated the chemical state of hematin-Fe(III) and phthalocyanine-Fe(II) biologically active centres by means of X-ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies. We explored up to an unprecedented level of accuracy how 4-aminoquinoline (4-AQ) compounds bind organic Fe. Sample solutions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were freshly prepared by mixing the mother solutions of the two componets a few minutes before each spectral acquisition. Both CH2Cl2 and DMSO solvents degrade kapton ® (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>), but the reaction with DMSO was slow enough to allow mounting of DMSO-containing solustions in a kapton ® -covered plastic holder without sensible effects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).  The sample was flash-frozen by immersing the sample holder in liquid nitrogen and then mounted on the closed circle He-cryostat at the ID26 spectrometer. HERFD-XANES, XES and valence-to-core signals were recorded while keeping the specimen in the 20-30 K T range. Organic Fe(II) compounds show a different shape of the XANES signal, already in the pre-edge region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). Addition of BQ to Fe-phthalocyanine (B2/S4) causes the high-E pre-edge peak at 7118 eV to disappear, while the signal at ~7.14 keV splits into two neatly distinguishable components. Other parameters, including E0, Kβ splitting and position of the vtc transitions, are not affected. Analogously to hematin solutions, addition of CQ (B2/S10) to Fe-phtalocyanine implies a + 3 eV shift of the absorption edge. On the contrary, addition of water changes (B2/B5) the signal of Fe-phthalocyanine in the pre-edge region and causes the E0 inflection to shift by +2 eV. The interaction of BQ with iron (II) chloride (B4/S6) implies detectable differences in the relative weight of the resonant peaks in the pre-edge region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>, inset), a small but detectable reduction (-0.4 eV) of the Kβ doublet separation, and a neat shift (+1.1 eV) toward higher energies of the vtc feature. These detected changes in the spectral features will be interpreted with reference to the current Literature, with the aid of high-grade quantum simulations.</p><p>It is also important to note how the use of different solution conditions has allowed to obtain a clear evidence of the solvent effect on the iron cation properties.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Leonardo Lo Presti*, Università degli Studi di Milano Laura Loconte, Università degli Studi di Milano Lucia Silvestrini, Università Politecnica delle Marche Silvia Rizzato*, Università degli Studi di Milano Fabio Beghi*, Università degli Studi di Milano Giovanni Macetti, Università degli Studi di Milano</figDesc></figure>
