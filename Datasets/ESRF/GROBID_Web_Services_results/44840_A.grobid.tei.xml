<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Ferroelectric phase transition of BaTiO 3 (BT) implies coupled changes in the crystalline structure and electric properties. It was believed that this transition was due to a distortion in the distance Ti-O in the tetragonal phase. It has been observed that structural and compositional changes affect the phase transition in a manner that is far from clear 123 . In this regard, the inclusion of metal nanoparticles suppresses the ferroelectric behavior of BT but increases notably the relative permeability. Previously, we have found that in BT samples with high Ni content, the dielectric permittivity was reduced at high applied bias voltage 4 , as it happens in the paraelectric phase, but nothing was said about any possible structural change near the transition. In this context, the obtained results have supplied new information about the nature of ferroelectricity suppression by metal particles. Samples were prepared in the Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales of Madrid (ICMM-CSIC) with Ni concentration ranging from 0 to 30%. X-ray diffraction measurements of these samples were taken using the six-circle diffractometer in the B branch of BM25 beamline. Simultaneously, we performed electrical measurements of capacitance and dielectric losses (using a LCR meter Agilent e4980) applying bias Voltages from 0 to 40 V at temperatures from 50º to 130º. All the measurements were performed using 18 shifts.</p><p>We expected to affirmatively answer the question if the suppression of the ferroelectricity in BT due to the inclusion of Ni particles had a counterpart in the crystalline structure. This is so in basis of the results obtained in this experiment. We have observed that:</p><p>-The phase change carries a change in the crystalline structure in the BT matrix. In samples of BT with</p><p>Ni concentrations of 28% it was observed that above 70º, the material present a paraelectric behavior, observed a diffraction peak corresponding to the cubic phase. Below that temperature, the sample showed ferroelectric behavior with diffraction peaks corresponding to the tetragonal phase. The change of interplanar distance vs. temperature for Ni and BT under an applied electric field appears in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. When temperature reaches 90º, the relative difference between ( <ref type="formula">002</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) planes in BT reduces until they take the same value becoming equal in the cubic phase. In that case of Ni, the atomic spacing always increases under increasing electric field. These data indicate that Ni particles suffer expansive stresses as a consequence of a net compressive of BT grains. All these data and the subsequent analysis is being processed and will be published shortly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
