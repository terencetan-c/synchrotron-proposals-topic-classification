<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Two large data sets comprising each 23 Crystal truncation rods were measured for water film and glycine solution film respectively, where 10 CTRs were measured with l-step of 0.2 and rest 13 were measured with l-step of 0.4. The CTRs with l-step 0.4 were later interpolated by using the information from corresponding stationary L-scans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental:</head><p>The experiment was carried out at the surface diffraction beamline BM25B at the ESRF. The fluorapatite crystal used was a natural mineral obtained from Durango, Mexico, with a flat natural growth (100) surface of the size about 10 x 5 mm. The crystal was mounted in an electrochemical cell coupled to a six-circle diffractometer. For measurements in completely hydrated conditions and with glycine solution, a drop of water/solution was maintained as film on the crystal surface using a Mylar foil. The measurements of the CTRs were performed in vertical scattering geometry. The incoming beam was focused about 0.5 mm and horizontally defined by slits to about 1.5 mm at the sample position. The incidence angle between the horizontally mounted sample surface and the X-ray beam was selected to 0.5°. The scattered beam was defined by a pair of slits in front of the detector set to 1 mm x 1 mm along the surface normal (vertical) and surface plane (horizontal), respectively. The integrated intensity of a given reflection was obtained by orienting the sample and detector to the respective diffraction condition and then collecting the detector signal in a rocking scan around the surface normal at both sides of the diffraction maximum.</p><p>The intensity profiles were corrected for polarization, lorentz and experimental factors fitted with a Lorentzian function and integrated after subtracting a linear background.</p><p>Here we report the surface model of fluorapatite surface in completely hydrated conditions. The analysis of CTR data taken with film of glycine solution is in progress and would be reported later. For analysis, we use an orthorhombic fluorapatite unit cell, with cell parameters a 1 = 9.367 Å, a 2 = 6.884 Å, a 3 = 16.224 Å, to model the bulk and the surface atom positions. Accordingly the 100) face of the hexagonal system equals the (001) face of the orthorhombic unit cell. This surface has the plane group symmetry pm with two mirror planes at a 2 = 0.25 and a 2 = 0.75. The used surface cell consists of 6 layers of atoms (in z direction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of fluorapatite -water interface in completely hydrated condition:</head><p>The initial model used for solving the surface structures of the (100) fluorapatite surface in completely hydrated condition was the ideal apatite surface termination where atomic relaxations were permitted in the 6 topmost surface layers. The final coordinates were determined by least square (L.S.) fitting of the experimental and calculated intensities. The L.S. refinement was carried out with a modified version of ROD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, that handles the phosphate groups as rigid bodies, thus reducing the number of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>From the data analysis of previous experiment with fluorapatite (100) surface in humid (with 75% r.h.) N 2atmosphere, we obtained a surface model where crystal surface was covered with an ordered monolayer of water at a distance of about 1.8 (1) Å above the relaxed surface. This monolayer of water is formed by four water molecules per unit cell which are related by symmetry (pm) of the underlying surface. Furthermore, water layer on fluorapatite (100) surface is stabilized by small atomic relaxations in surface unit cell. These atomic relaxations in surface layers were observed to decrease with increasing depth FIG. 2. Refined surface structure model of the orthorhombic unit cell of fluorapatite in humid (75% r.h.) N 2 ambient (left) and with water film (right). The ideal bulk structure is colored in grey and the refined structure is displayed multicolored (Ca green, PO 4 red-orange, F blue, H 2 O red-white).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Dr. German Rafael CASTRO Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Xavier TORRELLES b * Ms. Aparna PAREEK a * Prof Dr. Hermann GIES a * a Fak.
