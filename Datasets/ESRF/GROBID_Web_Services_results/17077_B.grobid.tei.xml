<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This is the report for the second half of 6 shifts allocated for investigating crystals of dynamin A from Dictyostelium discoideum. As no improvement was achieved for the crystals of dynamin A, we crystallized a mammalian dynamin and obtained a 4 Å data set during the first 3 shifts (24.02.00 to 25.02.00; see previous report).</p><p>Within the three shifts reported here, we screened about 20 crystals of the mammalian dynamin that were grown with different additives. The biggest crystals were somewhat bigger than the crystals tested in February and measured about 40 x 40 x 40 µm. We were able to identify crystals that showed diffraction spots to better than 3 Å and collected data on them.</p><p>They initially yielded useful diffraction data to 3.1 Å, however, beam damage was severe (after only 70 sec of total exposure time the limit for useful data went down to 3.3 Å, after another 60 sec. to 3.5 Å). Hence, the complete data set assembled from sweeps collected on several crystals does not reach the crystal's initial resolution of 3.1 Å. The current native data set for the mammalian dynamin was cut at 3.3 Å. We also started screening for heavy atom derivatives, but none has been identified so far.</p><p>As mentioned above,the crystals of full length dynamin A from Dictyostelium discoideum could not be improved despite of considerable effort. Besides crystallizing the mammalian dynamin we followed a second approach in order to solve a dynamin structure. We expressed and crystallized a functional domain of dynamin A from Dictyostelium. These crystals are WKLQ OHVV WKDQ P WKLFN SODWHV 7KH FU\VWDOV LQLWLDOO\ GLIIUDFWHG WR EHWWHU WKDQ Å, but again suffered strongly from beamdamage. Due to the low symmetry it was necessary to collect a large number of frames. To compensate for beam damage several crystals were used and the crystal was shifted to a new position after about 20 frames. A complete data set to 3.2 Å was assembled from these sweeps. We determined the unit cell (a=54.8 b=62.8 c=181.5 α=90 β=94.4 γ=90) and the space group (P2 1 ).</p></div>		</body>
