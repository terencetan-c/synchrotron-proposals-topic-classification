<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>1. Objectives In this experiment, we have scrutinized by in situ X-ray diffraction chemical reactions into inorganic molten salts. The aim was two-fold:</p><p>(1) Understand phase transformations during the reaction of metal nanoparticles with metalloid sources, which yield ex situ nanoparticles of compounds highly relevant for electrocatalysis of water splitting; (2) Screen reaction conditions in the search for new phases occuring as intermediate during reactions, in order to identify the conditions of their synthesis ex situ in the lab. The high flux and high energy 90 keV incident beam accessible at ID11 was necessary to assess the systems of interest mainly for two reasons: (i) the chemical species of interest were diluted; (2) the molten salt media were alkali and alkaline earth halides, highly X-ray absorbing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Set-up of the experimental station</head><p>The experiment was the first opportunity to test on site a new capillary oven we have designed for performing reactions into molten salts while enabling in situ analysis. The first shift of the experiment was dedicated to setting up the oven on the beamline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and adjusting the geometry of the hutch to the reach the q range required for the experiment. The open design enables probing the medium in the capillary by X-ray diffraction at ID11 but also by X-ray absorption on other beamlines. The capillary holder is specifically designed to enable liquid phase reactions in the capillary while flowing gas (here inert argon gas) for air sensitive reactions. Overall, this installation was a success, the capillary position was highly reliable, as well as gas flow and the air tight capillary holder. These features allowed very fast exchange of samples, even if all of them where stored in an argon filled glovebox of the central chemistry lab. Compared to a previous installation we had tested at DIFFABS beamline on SOLEIL, this set-up is an important progress for reliably acquiring data in a portable way on different beamlines for different techniques. Nonetheless, further improvements are required, especially enhancement of the thermal regulation through better insulation in order to ensure smoother temperature profiles. After adjusting analysis and detection conditions, the remaining shifts were dedicated to the analysis of reactions in molten salts. Most experiments were performed at 10 °C min -1 heating rate, which was identified as suitable to ensure crystallization to take place in the systems of interest in the lab. The capillaries were scanned continuously and diffractograms were acquired for 1.5 s at 10 positions of the capillaries. Hence, for each position, a diffractometer was assessed every ca. 30 s. The experiments dedicated to the understanding of reactions performed in the lab were performed with a dwell time of 10 to 30 min at the target temperature, according to the lab procedure. The other set of experiments dedicated to screening of reaction conditions were performed with only a ramp at 10 °C min -1 up to 750 or 1000 °C in some specific cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Monitoring of reactions within the nickel-boron-silicon and nickel-boron-phosphorus composition spaces</head><p>We have studied 40 reactions to explore the reaction between nickel precursors (metal nanoparticles or salts) with a boron source (NaBH4) and a silicon source (Na4Si4) or a phosphorus source (phosphines or red phosphorus). These experiments provided very beneficial results to (1) identify the crystallization sequences during reactions and then the conditions required for ex situ selective synthesis of a given phase; (2) explore in only one synthesis the whole temperature range at given positions in the composition spaces, in order to identify possible new metastable compounds.</p><p>A typical set of data acquired during heating is displayed Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, for the example of the reaction between NiCl2, Na4Si4 and NaBH4 in the molten eutectic mixture LiCl:KCl. The low temperature diffractograms exhibit high intensity diffraction peaks that correspond to the initial salts LiCl and KCl, which provide the molten salt medium upon melting (~360 °C), as observed by the disappearance of these peaks. Melting of the reaction medium is accompanied by the appearance of a strong scattering signal, which will be further analyzed in the near future by PDF. Further heating of the molten medium is accompanied by the growth of a new set of peaks, which are ascribed to the crystallization of one or several phases. Among those, one can identify Ni21Si12, although some more diffraction peaks may hint at additional phases. Further heating at 750 °C triggers the crystallization of the ternary compound Ni6Si2B at the expanse of the intermediate phases. Ni6Si2B crystallization starts at about 500 °C. This phase has been only sparsely described and only from bulk solid-state synthesis or from the elemental melt at 950 °C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> We succeed to obtain it as a pure phase in situ at 750 °C, which is consistent with our ex situ lab experiments. Moreover, these in situ experiments show that this phase starts to crystallize at surprisingly low temperatures compared to the reported phase diagram. Ex situ lab scale experiments also demonstrate that the material is obtained as nanoparticles, thus providing the first occurrence of a ternary Ni6Si2B phase at the nanoscale. The intermediate formation of Ni31Si12 indicates that the ternary phase occurs through a series of crystallization events, where Si is first combined with Ni, followed by boron. PDF analysis will be performed in the near future to analyze the structure of the ionic melt and of the identified crystalline phases appearing. We also observe in some cases the absence of XRD peaks in the first 50 °C after melting .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Monitoring reactions within the iron-boron composition space: feasability study</head><p>In another series of experiments, we have assessed the possibility to monitor the synthesis of iron boride FeB nanoparticles in a molten LiCl-KCl mixtures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows an experiment simulating the ex situ synthesis in the lab. The diffraction peaks of the targeted phase clearly appear after the salt melted, which confirms that the reaction takes in the molten medium. Before melting, a series of diffraction peaks appera in addition to those of the salts. Further examination is required to identify this component.</p><p>These results also show that we can study the crystallization of Fe-and B-based nanomaterials. This is particularly interesting in the perspective of further experiments in the future, for assessing the synthesis conditions for Fe-based 2D materials. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Overall, the experiment was fruitful in the following sense:</p><p>-It validated the design of our multipurpose oven for high temperature liquid-phase reactions. It also enabled identifying the future tracks for optimization. -It allowed identifying the crystallization sequence, then the formation mechanisms of several binary and ternary metal-p block elements. This knowledge sheds a new light on reaction mechanisms in molten salts. It will also enable selecting the conditions for ex situ synthesis of nanomaterials that could not be reached before, thus hindering the study of their properties. -Further analysis is now required to track the appearance of unidentified XRD peaks, which might indicate the occurrence of new compounds, which will then require further work for identification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions of the experiment:</head><p>This was the first experiment of the group on ID11. The local team provided excellent conditions for the experiment, and was very helpful for data retrieval and analysis. There were a series of loss of computer connection with the hutch, which resulted overall in the loss of 1 shift. Except this problem, the outcome of the experiment is very positive. Further data analysis is on the way to initiate rapidly the writing of a scientific paper on these first findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
