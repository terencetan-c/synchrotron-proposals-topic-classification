<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Supported noble metal catalysts (Pd, Rh, Pt, Ir) are intensively used in the catalytic combustion of methane, the catalytic partial oxidation of methane, and the selective reduction of NO x <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. One class of catalytic materials are Pd/ZrO 2 catalysts and we extensively studied those derived from glassy metal alloys (e.g. Pd 25 Zr 75 and Pd 33 Zr 67 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They are applied e.g. for the catalytic combustion of methane. Both thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction have been used to characterize these materials before activation and after their transformation to the active Pd/ZrO 2 catalyst, which is performed by oxidation in air according to: Pd 1 Zr 3 + x O 2 Pd/ZrO 2 (Pd contains mainly PdO under reaction conditions) The activated catalyst contains mainly PdO, but reduction and oxidation at low temperatures leads to oxygen containing Pd phases, which are X-ray amorphous. The uptake and loss of oxygen species can be quantitatively monitored by pulse thermal analysis. In order to gain more information on the catalyst system, EXAFS is a valuable tool because it can give in situ structural information. Thus, we have recently performed EXAFS studies before and after activation of the catalyst and during methane combustion (project 01-01-291). The results are in line with the hypothesis that both metallic and oxidized Pd is present under reaction conditions (report of project 01-01-291). We could also follow the oxidation of the PdZr foil, which occurred already at 400 °C, significantly below the crystallization temperature of a PdZr alloy.</p><p>In this period we concentrated more on the PdO/ZrO 2 catalyst itself and looked at the reduction and the re-oxidation in methane and oxygen as well as at the state of the catalyst under reaction conditions. Moreover, we completed the dataset on in situ studies of Pd/ZrO 2 catalysts. Finally, we compared our newly designed in situ EXAFS cells (pellet cell and capillary reactor cell, Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) among each other, which we also use at HASYLAB, APS and ANKA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1:</head><p>Overview on the different in situ cells, in this study a pellet cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) and a capillary cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>For the experiment, both an in situ cell based on Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> (pellet of 13 mm diameter pressed from PdO/ZrO 2 with Al 2 O 3 and BN) and Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref> (capillary cell, sieved catalyst powder, filled into glass capillary of 1 mm diameter). The corresponding gas mixture was fed to the in situ cell with a gas supply system consisting of mass flow controllers and valves for changing between different gases. The outlet of the cell was connected to a mass spectrometer for gas analysis and the exhaust system of the SNBL beamline. Under stationary conditions EXAFS spectra were taken around the Pd K-edge in the step scanning mode between 24000 and 25800 eV. Faster scans around the Pd K-edge were recorded using the normal step scanning EXAFS mode (ca. 5 min/scan). Characterization of the beam behind the sample in the capillary and the pellet cell was performed by an X-ray eye of Micro Photonics (Allentown, PA, USA). Using the X-ray eye, both the homogeneity of the samples was checked and the alignment of the in situ cell was optimised. Further details can be e.g. found in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of the X-ray beam behind the catalyst sample in the in situ cells</head><p>In a first step the X-ray beam behind the plug flow reactor cell and the pellet reactor cell were characterized. While the beam was homogeneous for the pellet cell (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2d</ref>), in the capillary cell the shadow of several corns can be seen. This may lead to decreasing signal-to-noise and the appearance of glitches. However, as recently discussed in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, for in situ catalytic studies this capillary cell is the favoured setup, since it is most similar to a catalytic reactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Hence, the homogeneity of the sample should be as good as possible which can be achieved with a small sieve fraction. position, (e) beam besides the pellet; beam is in all cases about 8 mm x 0.6 mm (publ. in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reduction of PdO/ZrO 2 in methane and re-oxidation in oxygen</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> and 3 show the reduction of PdO/ZrO 2 in 1%CH 4 /He and oxidation of Pd/ZrO 2 in 2.5% O 2 /He, respectively. While reduction of PdO/ZrO 2 in hydrogen already occurs at room temperature (within 5 min as evidenced in experiments at X1 at HASYLAB), the re-oxidation only partly occurs at room temperature. Interestingly, this oxidation has not been observed by TPO on Pd/ZrO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Some shift in the edge position was observed as well, indicating the decomposition of the Pd hydride phase (also supported by EXAFS analysis). Above 320°C, most of the palladium is re-oxidized and XANES/EXAFS analysis reveals no detectable metallic palladium after oxidation at 500°C, supported by thermal analysis (not shown). The reduction by methane also occurs only at higher temperatures (&gt;275°C) and results in a completely reduced catalyst. No reduction took place up to 275 °C. Above this temperature a very sudden reduction within 1 scan was observed. It seems that once methane can be activated on the PdO/ZrO 2 catalyst a fast reaction occurs. PdO was rapidly reduced once metallic particles started to be formed, which seem to catalyse the activation of methane. This is in agreement with temperature programmed reduction and Raman studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, where it was also found that a certain temperature is needed to activate methane. Once metallic palladium is formed, dissociative adsorption of methane is enhanced (on the metallic Pd particles) and further reduction occurs. The fact that an autocatalytic reduction occurs at 275 °C is also supported by the fact that dissociative adsorption of methane is reported to occur already at  5%O 2 /He during heating, the extent of oxidation was calculated by linear combination of XANES spectra for Pd/ZrO 2 and PdO/ZrO 2 , taken from ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reaction in 1%O 2 /4%O 2 /He</head><p>The behaviour of Pd/ZrO 2 during temperature programmed reaction in 1%CH 4 /4%O 2 /He uncovered in the low temperature region (&lt;350 °C) a similar behaviour as in 2.5%O 2 /He. The methane combustion (according to on-line gas analysis) sets in at 300 -320 °C (compare also results in report 01-01-291). Both the plug-flow reactor cell (based on the capillary) and the cell using a pelletized sample (disk-shape) were compared. In both setups, methane combustion was more effective over Pd/ZrO 2 (pre-reduced) than PdO/ZrO 2 (oxidized form by direct oxidation of amorphous PdZralloy). During the temperature programmed reaction the conversion of methane over "Pd/ZrO 2 " reached already its maximum well below 500°C, whereas only partial conversion of methane was observed over the PdO/ZrO 2 . The conversion over the "Pd/ZrO 2 "-pellet only reached about 80%, while total conversion was observed over "Pd/ZrO 2 " in the capillary cell. This is traced back to the dead volume of the pellet cell allowing some of the methane to pass through the cell without contact with the catalyst (by-passing). In both cases it was observed, that "PdO/ZrO 2 " was not reduced to an extent measurable by EXAFS/XANES, while starting from "Pd/ZrO 2 " evidenced that Pd was not completely reoxidized or possessed a different structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>), both if either the pellet or the glass capillary cell was used. The "whiteline" in the XANES spectra were slightly different and EXAFS analysis indicated a different number of coordination shells in the "PdO/ZrO 2 " and the "Pd/ZrO 2 " catalyst after methane combustion at 500 °C. While the "PdO/ZrO 2 " sample had mainly contributions at 2.02 Å (Pd-O) and at 3.02 Å (Pd-Pd in oxide), a significantly higher contribution at 2.76 Å (Pd-Pd shell) was found in the "Pd/ZrO 2 " catalyst (cf. more details and similar results in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). Hence, the findings on the structure of the catalyst are similar in both in situ studies, though the catalytic activity is different but with the same tendency in the two cells. Nevertheless, the significantly lower methane oxidation rate over the catalyst pellet compared to the corresponding particles in the capillary reactor requires an explanation. It is mainly due to the fast reaction rate of methane oxidation compared to diffusion in the solid. For a deeper discussion we refer to ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, where we have analysed the results in more detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Important results concerning the design of in situ clls and its combination with gas analysis have been gained which allowed us to derive criteria for in situ cells in general. In addition, important insight into the PdO/ZrO 2 system for methane combustion has been achieved. Both aspects have been published recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Note that data with better time-resolution than presently achievable at SNBL were required. These complementary experiments were performed in the QEXAFS mode at HASYLAB.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Photographs of the X-ray beam behind the plugflow reactor cell: (a) optimal position; (b) right end of the capillary cell; (c) X-ray beam below the capillary cell;similar images behind the pellet cell: (d) optimal position, (e) beam besides the pellet; beam is in all cases about 8 mm x 0.6 mm (publ. in ref.<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,41.22,58.44,297.12,237.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
