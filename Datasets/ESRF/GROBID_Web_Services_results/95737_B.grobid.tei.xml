<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the project was to search for pressure-indiced transitions in the highly distored fluoroperovsite NaCrF3, with the exotic Jahn-Teller active Cr(II) cation. This was the first high-pressure experiment on a NaCrF3, or, indeed, for any ACrF3. It was challenging to find the best conditions for the system, yet , we managed to complete five runs of NaCrF3 during the experiment and we gained a lot of insight to the system. In addition, the experiment also opened for new questions and follow-up experiments are desired.</p><p>For the first run, we discovered that NaCrF3 is particularly challenging to study at high pressure and temperature. We observed severe grain reconstruction under ver modest load that does not recover at high temperature, nor unloading (so not stress-induced). In addition, use of (fairly standard) B:Epoxy gasket that gave a lot of additional peaks in interesting regions, making it challenging to interpret the data, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. Nevertheless, we observed a transition from the tricilinc structure to a structure of higher symmetry upon heating under a pressure of about 8.4 GPa. The current understanding is that this phase, at that pressure and higher is a GdFeO3 perovskite, yet further investigations is needed to resolve this matter. On further, very moderate, heating, we observed a new phase appearing, identified as a cryolite phase. The cryolite phase is Na3CrF6 phase and indicates decomposition of the perovskite. This mode of occurrence of phase will be discussed in more detail below. a b</p><p>For the second run, we aimed for, and achieved, much clearer data, by use of ceramic non-oxide gaskets, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. However, this run was performed at about 5 GPa, and we observe a more direct transition from the triclinic perovskite structure to the cryolite phase, which is an intriguing observation, indicating some competition between perovskite and cryolite products. The third run was carried out at 12.5 GPa, to see if we could stabilize and crystalize the GdFeO3 phase at higher pressures, however, we again observed the formation of cryolite, though perhaps via a short-lived intermediate.</p><p>For the fourth run, we decided to do a pressure-scan up to 18 GPa to see if we could induce the transition by pressure only, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. Indeed, the peak splitting from the triclinic distortion progressively dissapears with applied pressure. Such merging is indicative of a 2 nd order, or very weakly 1 st order, transformation. This sample was decompressed without heating, to avoid cryolite formation, in order to attempt recovery of the HP phase. It, however, appears to have backtransformed on decompression. For the fifth and final run, we found very good conditions for following the transition to the GdFeO3type structure without formation of the cryolite phase, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. Furthermore, we were able to recover the sample successfully. Why we could recover this and not the sample produced at HP (alone) is unclear. The samples will undergo further investigations to verify the atomic arrangement by TEM and other methods in the home labratory. As we search for pressure induced transitions in NaCrF3, was the transition from the tricilinc NaCrF3-structure to a GdFeO3-phase indicative of the success of the experiment.</p><p>For the formation of the cryolite phase, several questions are still remaining. First, we do not observe the formation of Cr metal or/and CrFx, indicating that the cryolite phase might not have a composition of Na3CrF6. Furthermore, preliminary Rietveld refinements support that this might not be the correct composition. We speculate whether a double perovskite with two different Cr sites (Na2CrCr'F6) is formed, similar as for rare earth nickelates [1] or Fe2O3 at high pressures <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The two Cr sites may be different with respect to spin or valence state (e.g. 2Cr 2+  Cr 2+ + Cr 2- ; following <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>). The intensity of the cryolite peaks at ~3° (with respect to the remainder) determines the occupancy of potential lattice-doubling cation site (if Cr then it is weak and a perovskite, if Na it is much stronger and a cryolite). In the case of cryolite sensu stricto formation, through decomposition, this peak merging of 110/020 and 1-10 of NaCrF3 does not reach its conclusion and, instead, at phase formation, the peaks are displaced slightly (due to the different lattice volumes) and the low angle peaks at 3º are as intense as the next set of merged peaks at ~3.5º (for Na3CrF6 composition). Investigation of two structural options, where the sole topological difference is one sites occupancy for Na or Cr, requires (at least) continuous data collection. Clearly, a Na2CrCr'F6 perovskite with inequivalent Cr lattice sites (e.g., with mixed spin or valence) is also a cryolite but with retained perovskite stoichiometry. This situation, which is entirely reasonable, is very difficult to observe, given that the diffraction patterns (and structures) of such a cryolite and a GdFeO3 perovskite are near-identical (indeed the only difference is monoclinic splitting with  ~ 90º). We have requested further beamtime to explore these intreguing behaviours. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Temperature induced transition at 8.4 GPa.
