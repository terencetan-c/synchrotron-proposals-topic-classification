At the more positive potential only Cu was deposited, while at the more negative potential mostly Ni was deposited. The quantity of Cu and Ni deposited per cycle was varied from less than a monolayer up to several monolayers, so that the transition between heterogeneous alloy and conventional multilayer could be observed. Automatic compensation for e.g. Ni dissolution was made during growth. Samples were characterized magnetically and by scanning force microscopy prior to the ESRF experiment.</p><p>This experiment was the first with samples of this kind, and a major objective was to establish what information could be obtained from GISAXS measurements of the alloys with the smallest quantities of Cu and Ni deposited per cycle. Magnetic data for similar samples suggested that they would consist of disk-like Ni-rich clusters in a Cu or Cu-rich matrix. Although we lost some experimental time due to loss of beam following a thunder storm and problems at the station, we were able to study several samples at different energies close to the Ni absorption edge, at different sample-detector working distances and for a variety of angles of incidence. The quality of the data was high, with data (corrected for absorption and refraction effects) taken at different angles of incidence superposing quite well when plotted as a function of scattering vector q. Plotting ln (q 2 I(q)), where I is the scattered intensity, against q 2 gave a reasonably good straight line, as expected if the films may be approximated as an array of disks -see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. However, the fitted disk thickness did not depend on the amount of Cu and Ni deposited per cycle, which was unexpected, and at present we are still unsure as to the significance of this result. There was also no evidence for any in-plane anisotropy in the small angle-scattering.</p><p>From the GISAXS data of the films in which several monolayers of Cu and Ni were deposited per cycle we were able to identify Bragg peaks, enabling us to measure the films' superlattice repeat distance -see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. This was a very useful result, which we expect to publish at some point.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Guinier-type plot for electrodeposited Cu-Ni alloy. 2400 cycles, each consisting of the deposition of 1Å (equivalent thickness) Cu and 1Å Ni.</figDesc></figure>
