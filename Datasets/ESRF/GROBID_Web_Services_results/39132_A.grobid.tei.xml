<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our experiment was scheduled after the spring shutdown of the ESRF. Three of us have arrived earlier and have started preparation for the experiment on Monday, April 7 th . We have also made use of the buffer days, April 8 th and 9 th . In these time the setup was built and aligned together with the beamline personnel. Moreover, Dr. Wim Bras asked to check the functionality of the microradian setup with lenses at a higher photon energy E ph . Since the refraction index contast drops down as 1/E ph 2 , one needs more lenses to focus the x-ray beam at the same distance. An additional set of compound refractive lenses with N=31 lenses was prepared. Test measurements were performed at a photon energy of E ph = 24 keV (λ=0.5 Å) and a sampledetector distance of about 6 metres.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents an example of a diffraction pattern measured from a silicon grid (which is usually used as a calibration sample in our experiments). A number of test measurements on several colloidal crystals were also performed. Our results demonstrate that microradian resolution can be achieved at higher photon energies.</p><p>However, since the resolution in reciprocal space was compromised at higher energy, the rest of the experiment was performed using E ph = 13.5 keV (λ=0.92 Å), a set of N=7 lenses and a sample-detector distance of 8 metres. The data was collected using the Photonic Science CCD detector (22 microns pixel size) and the SESO camera (7 microns pixel size) was used for alignment.</p><p>In the main experiment we gathered Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> An example of the microradian diffraction pattern from a silicon grid with a hexagonal set of pores. The distance between the pores is 1.6 micron.</p><p>diffraction patterns of colloidal crystals of silica (SiO 2 ) colloids, which had been left to sediment in gravity for up to three weeks. Samples had been prepared in rectangular glass capillaries of inner dimensions 100 x 2 x 0.1 mm. After filling the capillaries they were sealed. Next, they were stored in upright position in order for the colloids to sediment and crystallize at the lower ends of the capillaries. The colloids used were all SiO 2 spheres of similar sizes, around 1 micron, but of different polydispersity: Three different synthesis batches were used in sample preparation, each with a slightly lower polydispersity than the previous batch (3%, 1.5%, and lower than 0.5%).</p><p>One type of suspension medium consisted of a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water, which matches the refractive index of the SiO 2 particles, so that their real-space structure can later be studied with confocal microscopy as well. The other type suspension medium was pure ethanol, in which particles are not refractive index matched, but experience a slightly higher gravitational force, due to the lower density of ethanol compared to SiO 2 . Also, the boiling point of ethanol is far lower than that of DMSO/water, so a dry sediment can easily be obtained by opening a capillary and letting the ethanol evaporate.</p><p>These three polydispersities and two solvent media account for six different types of samples, all of which small angle X-ray diffraction patterns were taken of at different sample orientations and different positions. Since the CCD detector has a limitted dynamic range (i.e., the difference between the highest and the lowest intensity, which can be reliably determined from a single diffraction pattern), all the measurements are performed with several exposure times. The shortest exposure data allow to quantify the strongest reflections while longer exposure data can be used for weaker higher-order spots.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> displays some typical diffraction patterns obtained from the samples suspended in DMSO/water. The particles used to obtain these diffraction patterns have an increasing polydispersity. Less than 0.5% in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure">1</ref>.5% in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref> and 3% in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref>.</p><p>Whereas in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref> many clear sharp diffraction spots can be seen, the spots are much broader and less intense in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref> and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref> only Debye-Scherrer rings are observed. Also visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref> are 'out of place' diffraction spots. The main hexagonal pattern is believed to be caused by a larger crystalline domain of the sedimented colloids, whereas the 'out of place' spots are believed to be caused by a second domain with a slightly different crystal orientation. From the width of the diffraction maxima and rocking curves we hope to quantify the effect of polydispersity on the crystal order in more detail. The results are expecrted to be of crucial imporatnce for the understanding of the influence of the particle polydispersity on the quality of photonic materials, which can be produced using the colloid self-assembly. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Diffraction patterns of silica colloid suspensions sedimented under gravity.
