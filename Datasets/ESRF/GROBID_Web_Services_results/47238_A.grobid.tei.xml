<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Self-organized nanostructures in C:Ni nanocomposite thin films have been investigated by grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). New 2D Pilatus detector has been employed to detect the scattered GISAXS intensity. The C:Ni films were grown by ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). During IBAD, the energy and momentum input into the growing C:Ni films is delivered by oblique incidence low energy (50-140 eV)</p><p>Ar + ion beam. The energy and flux of the ion beam can be varied independently. During thin film growth, atomic displacements are caused by impacting energetic ions, resulting in phase separation in an advancing surface layer. Some samples were deposited on hot substrates (300°C and 500°C) to investigate the interplay of temperature induced thermal mobility and ion induced ballistic effects.</p><p>For the films with low Ni content (~15 at.%), the results demonstrate that low energy (~50 eV) ion assistance induces strong anisotropy in the film density distribution, i.e. in nickel rich and carbon rich regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The effect persists and is even more enhanced for higher deposition temperatures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies show that such GISAXS structures correspond to Ni columns which are tilted in relation to the film surface. Morevoer, GISAXS allowed us establishing the orientation of the columns in relation to the ion beam which shows that the nickel nanocolumns tilt towards the incoming ions. For higher Ni atomic ratios the tendency is inversed.</p><p>Ion beam energy of ~130 eV results in sharp well-defined features in GISAXS patterns, some of them showing complex ripple-like intensity patterns (not shown). This is a manifestation of ion induced ordering processes during the film growth. It must be noted that these sharp features disapear if the sample is azimuthally rotated by 90°. This points out that the ion induced ordering is in the direction contained in the ion incidence plane. The origin of these features is currently under investigation and will be presented elsewhere.</p><p>From the fundamental point of view this study shows that phase separation processes at the nanoscale may be externally controlled assisting ion beam and substrate temperature. Therefore, ion beam assisted deposition can be considered as a promissing tool to grow oriented and ordered composite nanostructures. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
