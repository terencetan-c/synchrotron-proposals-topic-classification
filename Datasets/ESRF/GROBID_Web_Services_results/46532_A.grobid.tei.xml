<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to analyze the assembly of metal nanoparticles that are confined in shrinking emulsion droplets and clarify the mechanism of formation of supraparticles using synchrotron small-angle xray scattering (SAXS). Gold nanoparticles with 6 nm core diameter and size dispersion below 10% were introduced into the disperse phase of an emulsion. Microemulsions of their suspensions were prepared in water using mechanical shearing. We performed an assembly experiment by gently evaporating the dispersed solvent directly at the synchrotron, drew samples of the emulsion and charaterized them in scattering experiments at different evaporation times. A sealed vessel containing the emulsion was submerged into a thermostated bath and kept at 298 K. The vessel was connected to a nitrogen stream that bubbled through the emulsion to permit evaporation of the dispersed solvent. During the evaporation of the particle-containing emulsion, a sample of 0.3 µL emulsion was removed every 10 min, introduced into a flow-through capillary cell and characterized in a SAXS measurement. The procedure was repeated until complete evaporation of the solvent was reached. We used the same cell during all experiments to enabled reliable subtraction of the background. The experiments were repeated with two different sample-detector distances to cover a wide q range. Reference measurements on pure nanoparticle suspensions confirmed the geometry of the particle cores with a radius of 3.55 nm ± 0.33 nm. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows the evolution of the scattering intensity from the nanoparticle-containing emulsion during evaporation of the solvent. We observed a steady decrease of I(0) which probably indicates the shrinking of the droplets. Strong oscillations in the high q region (q &gt; 0.5 nm -1 ) are observed, while no oscillations are visible at lower q &lt; 0.1 nm -1 . The oscillations in the high q region is similar to that observed in the reference gold nanoparticle dispersion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, dotted line). They reflect the unchanged nanoparticles. Particles that are confined inside emulsion droplets often segregate to the oil-water interface to form Pickering emulsions. To assess whether this occurs in the emulsions here, we attempted fitting the data using two differents models: a cluster model and the core-shell model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> illustrates that the cluster model fits the scattering data best. A Pickering emulsion with the nanoparticles at the liquid-liquid interface would lead to a core-shell type of scatterers. Such geometries cause oscillations in the low q-range even if the droplets are broadly distributed in size, a signature that we did not observe in any of our evaporation experiments. The Form Factor of the nanoparticles F(q) from the reference measurements lets us evaluate the scattering intensity I(q) in oder to obtain a structure factor as S(q) = I(q)/F(q). Towards the end of the process, a peak appears on the structure factor curve that shifts to increasing q upon further evaporation (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We attribute this peak to the formation of nanoparticle cluster precursors with decreasing particle-particle distances.</p><p>We also performed experiment on dried clusters. Drops of the supraparticle-containing dispersion were placed on the surface of a mica window and allowed to dry in air. The windows were placed in a fourposition sample changer with their surface normal to the beam. The small-angle X-ray scattering image shows a ring, some reflexes on the ring and some weaker reflexes at slightly lower q. The ring represent crystalline regions in the supraparticles with different orientations, while reflexes probably represent the deviating interparticle spacing at boundaries inside the clusters.</p></div>

The effective structure factor S eff (q) was calcuated from the Form Factor F(q) of the nanoparticles from the reference measurements as S eff (q) = I(q)/F(q). The peak that occurs towards the end of the evaporation indicates increasingly dense, interacting particles. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1: Small angle X-ray scattering of samples retrieved during evaporation of the solvent.
