<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Fibre failure is one of the main mechanisms involved in final failure of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs), and a limiting factor of tensile strength. However, models are still unable to account for factors controlling the onset of unstable failure, and hence can not reliably predict behaviour at the highest load levels. This experiment performed at ID19 successfully captured progressive fibre-break formation in different CFRP material systems in conjunction with real time monitoring using acoustic emission.</p><p>A modified Deben CT5000 loading rig was used to apply and maintain incremental tensile loads to the specimens up to and including final failure with scans taken at each load step. High resolution (~0.7 micron) images were required to clearly visualise individual carbon fibres and be able to run an automated fibre break detection algorithm (developed in house specifically for this project). Speed of acquisition is another important factor as we did not want the specimens to endure high loads for prolonged periods such that stress relaxation effects and potential failure mid-scan could influence results. Due, in part, to the small field of view (~1.4mm 3 ) we used our tried and tested double edge notch specimen geometry to induce stress concentrations within the specimen to encourage final failure to occur within the scanned region of interest. Acoustic emission monitoring was performed by mounting sensors directly to the specimen (this had previously been proposed for use during expt MA636 but was not possible at that time), but away from the field of view of the synchrotron beam. Two sensors were used that enabled positional information from detected events (fibre breaks) to be located along the length of specimen between the sensors. The main aims here were to: (a) Identify if it was possible to simultaneously acquire AE and SRCT information from a CFRP specimen loading in situ. (b) Use the information form the AE to better comprehend the chronological build-up of fibre breaks and clusters within these different materials systems and effectively increase the region of interest beyond that of the field of view of captured during the scan. (c) Assess whether AE could be used to improve the efficiency of these experiments -in particular from the point of view of informing when a specimen is nearing final failure and selecting appropriate points to perform scans as opposed to the traditional pre-selection of %UTS values. (d) Reduce the time of acquisition such that we did not need to pause the loading test for scanning.</p><p>The experiment confirmed that it was possible to simultaneously acquire SRCT images of a CRFP specimen loaded in situ together with AE. The specimen used in these tests is very small and required physically small AE sensors in order that they could be mounted to the specimen and also fit within the loading rig. Since we were using two sensors (one above and one below the notched region) it was necessary to construct a cable management system to prevent the sensor wires from interfering with the beam during scanning. Furthermore, when we initially set up the equipment, the AE sensors were detecting a lot of background noise -electrically isolating the loading rig from the rotation stage was found to reduce the level of noise to such an extent that useful measurements became possible.</p><p>Information was gathered as to the build-up of acoustic events during loading. Clear patterns were identified the showed an increasing rate of event detection as the specimen neared final failure. Since it was possible to monitor this information in real time, more informed judgements as to when a specimen is approaching final failure is possible. Furthermore, the ability to provide locational information along the length of the specimen helped to indicate whether the specimen was more likely to fail at the top of bottom of the notch. This information is incredibly valuable for future experiments as capturing the exact point of final failure is often illusive.</p><p>With regards to fast scans -the initial ambition was to perform dynamic loading with scan times approaching or even less than a second. However, although the scan time was reduced from previous experimental campaigns, we did not achieve scan times short enough to continuously load the specimen during scanning. None-the-less the experiment did provide significant advances and information for damage prediction models. In particular, information concerning the rate of indvidual fibre breaks was captured as a function of fibre stress (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) progressive fibre breaks were observed within the same co-planar cluster, as well as mutliple fibre breaks within the same fibre (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> &amp; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The experience and methods developed during this campaign will inform testing strategies and methods to improve future campaigns.</p><p>One article has been published on this work to date at the 3rd International Conference on Tomography of Materials and Structures 'ICTMS2017' Lund, Sweden, 26th -30th June 2017   ~ 1550 N ~ 1475 N ~ 1400 N ~ 1250 N 100 µm a ) b) Same breaks segmented and extracted 100 µm 1.3 mm</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Graph showing accumulation of fibre breaks as counted using automated detection algorithm as a function of fibre stress.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.95,429.25,326.75,233.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
