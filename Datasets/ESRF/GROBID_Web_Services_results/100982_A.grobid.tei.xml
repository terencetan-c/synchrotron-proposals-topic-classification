<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Introduction</head><p>The objective of the experiment was to comprehend a novel heteroepitaxial approach that relies on the coalescence of GaN pyramids grown on top of GaN/AlN/Si(111)/SiO2 nano-pillars of 100nm diameter (figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) into GaN 40 x 40µm 2 platelets (figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Our growth approach assumes a twist/tilt of the nano-pillars and a self-alignment of GaN layers during coalescence preventing the formation of grain boundaries and causing a dis-orientation of the Si(111) layer at the top of the nanopillars. Therefore, we determined using k-map technique the orientation of the Si sections in the nano-pillars as well as the GaN layers before and after coalescence to understand the coalescence process. In addition, it is crucial to get the strain distributions of GaN to gain insight on the quality of the GaN layers for optoelectronic applications such as microLEDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed</head><p>To determine the orientation of the nano-pillars induced by coalescence, a sample area of 20 x 20 µm 2 was mapped and the asymmetrical Bragg reflection Si (331) in this top silicon (111) layer was measured for sample A which is a reference sample that has only nano-pillars, i.e. prior to the pyramids growth. Same measurements were repeated for sample B (figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) where an area of 30 x 40 µm 2 was studied. For both samples, we performed rocking curves and took diffraction images every 150nm in x direction and 200nm in the y direction nm for different incidence angles (51° &lt; w &lt; 52.75°). Then, to determine the GaN orientation as well as the strain distribution in the GaN layers, measurements were performed around the GaN (105) Bragg peak for varied incidence angles (59.4°&lt;w&lt;60.8°) for both samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the individual silicon pillars and GaN layers before and after coalescence (after sample shift correction) measured on ID01. In the reference sample A, the Si layers are well oriented with maximum ω variation of Δω=0.96° (figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and the GaN layers are completely disoriented with Δω=1.5° (figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>) which is expected due to the heteroepitaxial growth of Nano-pillars GaN layers. In sample B, we notice a gradient in ω along the diagonal over a length scale of ∼ 44 μm for both Si and GaN layers (figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> and <ref type="figure">2d</ref>). This gradient is probably related to a curvature (figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) of the sample that occurs during the cooling phase of the growth process. To fully comprehend the behavior of the Si and GaN layers after coalescence, it is necessary to eliminate this curvature and its influence on the orientation of the layers. Therefore, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b) was derived from a post-processing of the data presented in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, it illustrates the variation of the Si and GaN layers omega (ω) after the removal of the curvature.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(b), we notice that the Si in the nano-pillars is more disoriented with a maximum Δω=1.62° compared to the reference sample (Δω=0.96°) , this means the coalescence of GaN pyramids causes dis-orientation of the silicon in the nano-pillars, implying that the growth occurs as intended. Also, in the GaN layers (figure <ref type="figure">3c</ref>), the variation of ω after coalescence and after curvature removal is relatively small (Δω=0.78°) compared to the GaN in the reference sample (Δω=1.48°) indicating that the obtained GaN layers are well oriented. These results are beneficial as they prove that the self-realignment of GaN on Si(111), help in understanding the coalescence process and identifying the quality of the GaN layers. For a more detailed study of the quality of GaN layers, GaN measurements were also examined by creating a reciprocal map at each position of the sample and determining the components of the scattering vector Q, to extract the relative strain of 0.06% (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) as function of the beam position for the GaN before coalescence. Further analysis of the rest of the datasets will allow us to obtain the tilt and strain map in the Si and GaN layers before and after coalescence. These findings along with others [1] are promising for the fabrication of small highly oriented islands of GaN on silicon suitable for micro-LEDs. Therefore, the capacities of this powerful diffraction technique at ID01 opens the door for future investigation on newly improved high-quality samples with different pillars pattern.
