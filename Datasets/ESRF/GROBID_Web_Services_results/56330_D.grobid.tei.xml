<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Within the allocated beamtime, we conducted high-presssure (P) and -temperature (T) in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on Fe-Si alloys in an internally-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) at ID27. The principal research goal is to place constraints on the P-T location of the boundary between the facecentred cubic (FCC) structure and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure in Fe-4wt%Si.</p><p>In-situ XRD experiments were performed at ID27 with a monochromatic wavelength of 0.3738Å. The sample temperature was measured by the spectroradiometric system availiable on the beamline and the pressure was obtained from the unit-cell volume of the HCP phase and its thermal equation of state <ref type="bibr">(Tateno et al., 2015)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a summary of the experimental P-T conditions and observed Fe-Si phases in Fe-4wt%Si in the internally heated DAC. Note that only selected data points are shown here. We conducted five separate sets of internal resistive heating experiments at different pressures. This has been the first time we ever used our internal heating techqnique at ID27. In all the runs we succesfully heated the sample at temperatures much higher than those currently achievable by external heating (T max ~1200 K), which demonstrates the feasibility and compatibility of this technique with ID27.</p><p>First we increased the pressure at room temperature. At a constant load, the temperature was then increased by directly appling a DC current across the metallic sample (thermally insulated from the diamods). The first cell was compressed to 16 GPa and then heated to 1160 K. We obseved disappearance of all the peaks of the HCP phase and appearance of FCC peaks at that temperature, the minumum value possible to measure by spectroradiometry in that run. Experiments on the second cell, showed coexistence of the FCC and HCP phases at 1220 and 1350 K. From experiments carried out on the third cell, we observed single FCC phase at the highest temperature and placed constraints on the HCP-out reaction. In the fourth and fifth runs, the HCP phase was observed stable till the highest reached temperatures.</p><p>For comparison, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we also plotted the HCP-FCC transition boudanry in pure iron <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Komabayashi et al., 2009)</ref>. The present experiments demonstrate that higher temperatures are needed to enter the FCC stability field for Fe-4wt%Si samples than pure iron, therefore. The FCC-HCP transition boundaries in Fe-4wt%Si is then placed at higher temprerature than in pure iron (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a comparison of the present data with existing literature data in Fe-3.4 wt%Si <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asanuma et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Fischer et al., 2013)</ref>. Note that Fischer et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) estimated the phase relations in Fe-3.4 wt%Si based on their experimental data in Fe-9 wt%Si. The results of the previous laser-heated DAC studies are clearly not in agreement. Moreover from comparisons with the pure iron boundary (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the two studies show opposite Si effect to the relative stability of FCC and HCP phases. Our new data are qualitatively consistent with those of Fischer et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>), namely, addition of Si increases the transition temperature.</p><p>We also conducted two test runs in the laser-heated DAC on a Fe-6.5 wt%Si sample. We observed appearance of the FCC phase (i.e., FCC-in reaction) at 1860 K and 31 GPa and at 2370 K and 55 GPa. Such temperature conditions are higher than those for pure iron and therefore, confirmed the positive effect of Si on the transition temperature.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (left).
