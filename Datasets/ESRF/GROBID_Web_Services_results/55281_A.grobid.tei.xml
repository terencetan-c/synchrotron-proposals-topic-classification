<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Background Within the first 14 days after birth, mice grow significantly in length and weight. To withstand increasing load/force on the limbs, the long bones must swiftly adapt morphologically and stiffen structurally. Although mice bones have become an important model organism for the study of bone healing, aging and disease (e.g. osteoporosis) surprisingly only little is known about the normal tissue formation dynamics in these important research models. Our aim is to understand soft to hard-tissue transformation in the early development stages in healthy mice. The dynamics that lead a porous foam-like femur-bone rim in the young to expand and later "densifiy" to form a solid cortical shell within only several days, will be unraveled by comparing 2D soft-tissue histology and 3D tomography helping understand structural transformation at mm and micrometer length scales. The aim of the performed experiment was to benefit from the narrow bandwidth radiation that ID19 provides, to obtain information about the 3D mineral deposition/distribution/density. Furthermore, phase contrast should be used to reveal the morphological changes occurring near blood-vessels, as well as providing information about the soft tissue (non-mineralized) spaces (size, shape, proportion and orientation). This information will provide the foundation to later understand abnormal bone structural changes in mammals, in 3D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments and Setup at ID 19</head><p>Healthy mouse femora of different aged mice (1, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days after birth, n = 5 samples/age) were extracted with the soft tissue partially removed. Samples were fixed with ethanol or paraformaldehyde to prevent tissue degradation and stored in sealed polyethylene vials in an ethanol environment. Whole bone overview scans with a low resolution (10µm effective pixel size) were obtained using a laboratory x-ray source to identify the regions of interest for the high resolution scans obtained at the ESRF.</p><p>High resolution (effective pixel size 0.647µm) synchrotron radiation computed tomography scans were performed at the ID 19 beamline with x-ray energies of 20 -30keV. Samples were imaged at 360 degrees using a rotation step size of 0.09 degrees, resulting in 4000 projections per sample. Each sample was imaged at multiple detector distances to obtain absorption and phase-contrast enhanced information. Combining the different imaging modes will allow holotomographic reconstruction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis and preliminary Results</head><p>We were successful in imaging all samples with the different imaging modes. We could thus obtain absorption (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>) as well as phase-contrast high resolution images which we used to reconstruct holotomographies (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>) that allow for direct tissue density extraction This should help us to reveal the mineral density changes occurring during the massive structural changes occurring in the bones within the first two weeks of a mouse life. Also, due to the very high contrast of these imaging modalities, small pore extraction and characterization and thus information on the changes in the porosities occurring in the mouse femur maturation can be obtained. Although the reconstruction and analysis is still ongoing, we obtained very promising preliminary results so far. The cross-section image nicely shows the density-differentces within the tiny, mineralized struts present in theses young bones. Additionally, the images exhibit a high contrast, allowing for pore segmentation, shown here with a magenta overlay.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1A) Cross sections of femora of different aged mice (1, 7 and 14 days after birth) obtained with apsorption tomography.
