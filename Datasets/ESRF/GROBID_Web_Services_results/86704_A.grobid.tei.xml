<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In hypothetical accidental situations in a nuclear pressurized water reactor, fuel cladding tubes made of zirconium alloys can be exposed to steam at high temperature up to 1200°C, before cooling down to room temperature by water quenching. In such conditions, the cladding material undergoes several structural and metallurgical evolutions (growth of zirconia, oxygen diffusion through the metal, phase transformation of both the metal and the oxide…) causing internal stresses (at micro and macro scales). The objective of the present experiments was to follow in situ the oxidation process of one zirconium alloy (Zircaloy-4) at high temperatures, up to 1200 °C, and to determine the evolution of the structure and microstructure of zirconia layers as a function of temperature, time and oxidizing atmosphere. The stable phase of pure zirconia below 1170 °C is the monoclinic one (P21/c space group), nevertheless the tetragonal phase of zirconia (P42/nmc space group) can be stabilized at lower temperatures by stresses or when the crystal size is in the nanometric range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and conclusions of the study:</head><p>On the experimental point of view, we had to follow simultaneously the evolution of the monoclinic to tetragonal phases volume fraction, the mean size, and the elastic strain of the crystals in the two structural forms, during heating, isothermal holding and cooling. One of the tricky aspects was that a strict control of the temperature, atmosphere (injection of flowing helium as a neutral gas and of a mixing of helium and oxygen as an oxidizing gas), and oxidation process, was needed. All the experiments have been realized thanks to the QMAX furnace which is available on the BM02 beamline. This prototype furnace has been already used during other experiments at temperatures as high as 1700°C, nevertheless during our experiment in September 2017 we were not able to reach in a convenient manner the expected temperatures, and we had to face many technological problems with the heating resistor. Thus the beamline manager allocated us 12 additional shifts at the end of January 2018. The results presented in this report have been obtained during this last experimental session.</p><p>According to the literature in the range from 700 °C to 1200 °C, the kinetics of the oxidization process is strongly depend of temperature. Very fast process was expected at high temperature and our aim was to follow the formation of the oxide with a time resolution of 1 sec. All the diffraction patterns have been recorded using the XPAD-WOS 2D detector which allows recording a part of the Debye-Scherrer rings. The detector was fixed on the 2 goniometer arm at a distance of 850 mm from the specimen. The energy of the Xray beam was fixed at 17.6 keV, just below the zirconium Kedge. Temperature measurement in another tricky part of the experiment. It was monitored during the experiment via two thermocouples, one fixed on the heating resistor, and one spotwelded directly on the specimen surface. Accurate temperature was also determined after the experiment by following the evolution of the diffraction peak positions of the NIST -alumina powder placed onto the sample. Typical diffraction images recorded before and after oxidation are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. One image was acquired every second. All the diffraction rings corresponding to zirconium, monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia, and alumina are clearly evidenced. With the used setup, diffraction rings do not overlap. T=25 °C T=783 °C Alumina Zirconium alloy</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zirconia</head><p>We first followed the oxidation of one sample as a function of temperature under flowing He-O2 with a relatively low oxygen partial pressure. Patterns recorded at room temperature and at 800°C are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Zircaloy-4 and alumina diffraction peaks are clearly identified on the pattern recorded at room temperature. The mains diffraction peaks are observed for both monoclinic and tetragonal phases of zirconia. Thanks to a convenient choice of the setup parameters (X-ray beam energy, detector size and position) these peaks are located between the alumina and Zircaloy peaks without any overlapping. All the patterns have been recorded after careful optimization of the primary beam which was nearly-parallel (horizontal and vertical focalization far away after the detector). One of the noticeable points is that although the use of a 2D detector and a data reduction process through azimuthal integration, the obtained instrumental function is symmetric and exhibits a small full width at half maximum (FWHM) close to 0.03°. As evidenced in Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>, the FWHM of zirconia peaks is significantly higher. This is due to microstructural effects. On Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> we reported a direct illustration of the oxidation process during heating of the sample, performed under an atmosphere containing oxygen.</p><p>The intensities of the two zirconia diffraction peaks are continuously growing. It seems that increasing the temperature induces a decrease of the relative amount of tetragonal zirconia compared to monoclinic zirconia. Moreover, the FWHM of the peaks is continuously decreasing. This is related to the crystals growth process.</p><p>A second part of the experiment was devoted to the determination of the coupling between crystals growth kinetics for both monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia phases and the variation of the relative amount of these two phases. This aspect was studied through isothermal treatments at various temperatures. As an illustration, the evolution as a function of time of the mean size of the monoclinic crystals during isothermal oxidation at 700 °C is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We were able to determine this mean crystal size for each pattern recorded every second. As a consequence very smooth evolution was observed. By using such results and the evolution of zirconia phases volume fractions, we will be able to evidence the main characteristics of the Zircaloy-4 oxidation process at high temperature. Strain evolution (not shown here) will be also considered.</p><p>Justification and comment about use of beamtime (5 lines)</p><p>The realization of such measurements is quite tricky on the experimental point of view. Thanks to an accurate control of the gas flow into the furnace we were able to introduce oxygen at a chosen moment. The BM02 diffraction setup associated to the QMAX furnace is very well-suited for such in situ measurements. We were thus able to realize time resolved measurements of the oxidation process of Zircaloy-4 at high temperature, with a good control of temperature and atmosphere, with a time resolution of 1 sec.
