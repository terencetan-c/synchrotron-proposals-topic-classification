<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effect of the Ag site on the refractive index of Ag-for-Na ion-exchanged glass waveguides. An EXAFS + reflEXAFS experiment at the Ag K-edge allowed investigating the Ag site in Ag-for-Na ion-exchanged glass waveguides. We have measured ion-exchanged waveguides doped with Ag at different concentration (average Ag/Na ration = 0.1-0.8). The most interesting results are obtained in grazing incidence geometry, with the incidence angle very close to the critical one. This geometry required a high stability of both the x-ray beam and of the sample holder (the critical angle is about 0.08 deg), see figure (left panel). The incidence angle was chosen to probe different thickness, from ≈5 nm to few µm. A collection of 5 different samples were measured at different incidence angle, at room temperature and in fluorescence mode (a 13-elements HP Ge detector was used). We obtained an unexpected result since, apart from the usual Ag-O coordination, already investigated in a previous experiment (see the corresponding paper: C. Maurizio et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 113 (2009) 8930) and visible in the EXAFS signal of all the samples, a Ag-Ag coordination is also well visible in the Fourier transform moduli of the EXAFS spectra when the probed depth is less than few µm. Actually, the ReflEXAFS measurements pointed out that the surface layer present a significant contribution from metallic Ag, even if the glass underwent an ultrasound bath of FeNO 3 water solution to dissolve the metallic Ag. The metallic fraction decreases as the probed thickness is increased (See the pseudo-radial distribution function of atoms around the Ag site from EXAFS in the figure, right panel). The Ag clusters (small, likely below 1 nm, since the Ag-Ag distance is ≈2.7, to be compared with the value of 2.88 for the Ag bulk) are likely located in a sub-surface layer; moreover, the variation of the Ag-Ag distance as a function of the penetration depth suggests that larger clusters are located closer to the surface. The picture that comes out from the EXAFS data is schematically represented in figure (bottom-left panel).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Further analysis are in progress to better quantify i) the cluster size, ii) the metallic fraction at different depths, iii) the Ag-O coordination at different depths. These results will be related with the refractive index variation induced by the Ag ions. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>n ce a n g le (d e g ) re fle c tivity A g K α flu o</figDesc></figure>
