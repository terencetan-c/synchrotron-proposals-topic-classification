<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> we have investigated the nucleation, growth and crystallization of Ge nanoclusters in amorphous SiO 2 matrix. We have demonstrated that originally amorphous Ge clusters crystallize during post growth annealing creating crystalline quantum dots. Moreover, in Ge+SiO 2 /SiO 2 multilayers we found that the positions of the quantum dots are correlated creating a well developed rhombohedral lattice. We have explained this self-organization process by the influence of the morphology of the growing surface on the diffusion of Ge adatoms during the growth. In order to prove this idea, we have investigated in-situ the nucleation and growth of Ge nanoclusters in Ge+SiO 2 /SiO 2 multilayers deposited on quasiperiodically corrugated surfaces. The substrates were produced by the ion beam erosion of Si(100) wafers creating quasiperiodic ripples, the AFM image of the ripples is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We have chosen the parameters of the ion erosion so that the resulting ripple period (19±2) nm was close to the "intrinsic" distance of Ge nanoclusters on a flat substrate. The rippled Si surface was used as a substrate for the deposition of the Ge+SiO 2 /SiO 2 multilayer. We deposited 5 bilayers Ge+SiO 2 /SiO 2 using dual (AC/DC) magnetron sputtering, the substrate temperature was 400°C and the Ge:SiO 2 molar ratio was approximately 75:25 in the mixed layers. After the deposition of each bi-layer we measured a grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) intensity map. The probing x-ray beam was directed parallel to the ripples direction, so that the intensity distribution measured in the reciprocal plane perpendicular to the primary beam reflects a spatial correlation of the ripple positions and the influence of the periodicity of the ripples on the correlation of the positions of the growing Ge nanoclusters . GISAXS maps were measured for two incidence angles of the probing beam, i.e. at the critical angle and slightly above it. In the former case we see mainly scattering from the surface, while in the latter the beam penetrates into the deposited film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). All maps exhibit strong lateral satellites stemming from the ripple periodicity, these satellite maxima are elongated vertically and their height along q z is inversely proportional to the ripple depth. The strongest satellites are visible for the substrate and their periodicity corresponds to the ripple period of 19 nm. The GISAXS maps taken with the critical incidence angle after the growth of individual bilayers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a)) are rather similar to that of a naked rippled substrate, which indicates that the morphology of the rippled substrate is replicated during the growth. The surface of each newly deposited layer contains ripples with a very similar geometrical arrangement. However, the degree of spatial correlation between ripple positions decreases during the deposition, since the lateral satellites become less pronounced.</p><p>For the examination of the inner structure of the film, the probing beam with a higher incidence angle was used (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b)</ref>). The resulting GISAXS maps exhibit vertical satellite maxima indicating that the local morphologies of the interfaces of different layers are correlated. This correlation might be described as a roughness correlation using standard models, or as a correlation of the positions of Ge nanoclusters. A detailed numerical comparison of the measured intensity distributions with the intensities following from these two structural models is necessary in order to confirm unambiguously the presence of the correlation of the positions of the nanoclusters induced by the ripples underneath, this work is underway. After the deposition the film was annealed in vacuum up to 800 o C and the GISAXS maps were measured insitu after each 100 o C step in the annealing sequence starting from 600 o C (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). All maps are very similar showing that the layers keep their morphology during the annealing. With increasing annealing temperature, the overall GISAXS intensity increases indicating that the contrast in the electron densities in the clusters and the surrounding increases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
