<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was observation and analysis of the field-dependent rearrangement of the magnetic nanoparticles in the top layer of the ferrofluid (FF). Specifically, we wanted to prove that Rosensweig instability (RI) develops on two substantially different scales -first, on microscopic scale in subcritical fields (H&lt;H C ) and then on macroscopic scale at H=H C (conventional RI). Here H C is the critical value of the magnetic field determined in the classical Ferrohydrodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. For this purpose we used specular x-ray reflection and grazing incidence x-ray scattering (GISAXS and GID).</p><p>The samples were colloidal suspension of magnetite particles in heavy water. The particles are stabilized with a double layer of surfactant molecules, which makes them hydrophilic and provides stability of the system. The samples with volume concentration of magnetite C=2% and C=7% are called hereafter FF2 and FF7 respectively. The mean size of the particle D m in FF2 is supposed to be two times smaller than in FF7, where D m is about 10 nm. Schematic construction of the stabilized particle and electron density values for its components are shown in Fig.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Assuming that particle reorganization in the external filed should give rise in drastic change of the surface roughness, we observed, first, an evolution of the reflected beam parameters at fixed angle of incidence α i during field increasing-decreasing cycles. The result for FF7 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> as obtained at α i =0.12° (top) and α i =1.80° (bottom). One can see that specular beam not simply changes its intensity but also gets broader, changes its position in space and even splits at higher fields in the case of lower angle of incidence. Different behavior at different α i is related to the beam footprint (24 and 1.6 mm respectively). The larger footprint the large surface deformations it "feels". This means that from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> one can estimate a characteristic lateral size of the humps growing on the FF surface at different field values (also at H&lt;H C !). The slope of the humps can be calculated from the specular beam position as compared to the initial values. For example, at H=110 Oe this slope makes an angle 0.12° with the original sample surface plain at H=0.  Specular reflectivity measurements performed at zero field revealed rather complicated depth profile for both samples as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. It was not possible to fit these data with a simple Parrat model consisting on one or two layers on top of the bulk. The main feature of all best fit models is the magnetite enriched layer covered with a layer of lower electron density, which could be water or surfactant molecules (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Electron density in the "bulk" (i.e. at z&gt;200 Å) is about two time higher than the value calculated for the homogeneous sample. The structure remains stable during at least 10 hours as it was proved by the recurrent reflectivity measurements.  The reflectivity data obtained for different field values for FF2 and FF7 are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> respectively. The experimental reflectivity R was multiplied by q z 4 and background corrected to give an access to the smallest details. One can see that there is no field-induced microscopic change of the depth profile of FF2. (The reflectivity degradation at low q z is related to the mm-scale deformation of the surface which was explained hereinabove). At the same time FF7 exhibits a slight evolution of the very top layer on the nm level as it is seen from the intensity growth of the interferential maximum at q z =0.33 Å -1 . Interestingly, this evolution stops before the moment when the macroscopic deformation of the surface develops on such level that it destroys completely the specular reflection condition at low angles of incidence (compare yellow and blue points in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>.). Quantitative analysis of such data is accomplished by the absence of the total reflection region on the reflectivity curve which leads to the divergence in the fitting process.</p><p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 α Y , deg H = 63.7 Gs FMZh19 α i =1.00 deg (I) H = 0 Gs α Z , deg 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 α Y , deg 2,0 2,6 3,3 4,3 5,5 7,1 9,1 11,7 15,1 19,4 25,0 0 . 1 1 9 Å -1 6.5 5.5 4.5 3.5 2.5 1.5 0.5 6.5 5.5 4.5 3.5 2.5 1.5 0.5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 α Y , deg H = 63.7 Gs FMZh19 α i =1.00 deg (I) H = 0 Gs α Z , deg 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 α Y , deg 2,0 2,6 3,3 4,3 5,5 7,1 9,1 11,7 15,1 19,4 25,0 0 . 1 1 9 Å -1 6.5 5.5 4.5 3.5 2.5 1.5 0.5 6.5 5.5 4.5 3.5 2.5 1.5 0.5 20,0 20,5 1, 0 1, 4 1, 8 2, 2 2, 6 3, 0 3, 4 3, 8 4, 0 16,0 16,5 17,0 17,5 18,0 18,5 19,0 19,5 200 400 600 800 1000 D lat =4.51 Å 16,0 16,5 17,0 17,5 18,0 18,5 19,0 19,5 20,0 20,5 4,5 5,0 5,5 6,0 6,5 7,0 PSD, channels int. intensity, a.u. a Y , deg a) b) 20,0  To reveal inplain ordering in the top layer of our samples we performed GISAXS measurements at α i &lt;α C and α i &gt;α C for different field values. Here α C =0.155° and α C =0.160° are the critical angles for FF2 and FF7 respectively. The most interesting result was obtained for FF2 at α i =1°. It is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>. At zero field we have found not only scattering from the independent particles (form factor) but also diffraction rings indicating strong correlations in the system. The correlation length calculated from the distance between the rings is found to be 52 Å, which is close to the particle core diameter. When the filed of 63.7 Oe (or higher) was applied the diffraction features of the scattering pattern disappeared, demonstrating dissipation of the ordering. However, after the field was switched off the structure with the same periodicity was recreated.</p><p>High angular GID measurement on FF7 at zero field and α i =0.11° revealed the only diffraction peak at the horizontal angle α Y =20.1°. This corresponds to the lateral periodicity of 4.51 Å. Most likely, the origin of this peak is hexagonal ordering of the surfactant molecules in a special layer on the top of the whole sample. This means that on the depth profiles shown in the insets of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> the very first sublayer is composed of sodium oleate molecules with a long axis oriented perpendicular to the surface.</p><p>One can see that surface X-ray scattering experiments performed on ID10b have brought unique information about the structure of the FF layer close to the interface with air. For instance, GISAXS data for the sample FF2 (smaller D m and low concentration) give a hint that arrangement of the nanoparticles in horizontal plain is strongly influenced by the external magnetic fields H already at H&lt;H C . Surface-in-whole evolution revealed by specular reflection measurements is also very interesting and intriguing. However, complete understanding of the phenomena observed will require more careful data analysis and, definitely, further experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
