			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this work, comparison of the role of activation under H2:N2 gas mixtures compared to H2:Ar on the CoRe4 phase was undertaken. In laboratory based studies undertaken in Glasgow it is known that there is an induction period related to the use of the latter mixture whereas in the case of H2:N2 catalysts display immediate high activity and result in materials which are more active than their H2:Ar pre-treated analogues. Particular emphasis was placed upon obtaining high quality Co edge data. The ammonia synthesis in-situ XAS/XRD experiments was undertaken at both the Re LIII and Co K-edges in pre-treatments of 2% H2 in N2 or Argon. This concentration of hydrogen is significantly lower than the reactions conditions initially used during laboratory testing (3:1 H2:N2), but due to our beamtime being moved up gases could not be ordered in time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It was initially believed that an amorphous nitride phase, forming in H2:N2, was accountable for activity in the CoRe4 system, however our in situ XAS analysis reveal that the active phase is in fact metallic Re 0 and Co 0 with a high degree of nanoalloying occuring in the system. The N2/H2 pre-treatment affects the reducibility of rhenium, but the active phase is quite similar for both protocols. We have strong indications of the Co(II)Co 0 step initiating reduction, however our initial studies used a very low concentration of H2. Our findings suggest that the microstructure of the nanoalloy changes during reaction conditions, possibly due to cobalt segregation. We also find that the Re-Re coordinaiton numbers are greater in H2:N2 PT, indicating larger particles forming during this protocol and significantly less bimetallic Co/Re interaction (see Figure ). A cycling experiment was undertaken, treating the sample stepwise with gas components, which revealed that Co 0 Co(II) re-oxidation occurs instantly when removing H2 from the feed (see figure below). Re-introducing H2 leads to a significant increase in ammonia production (see raw MS data below), possibly due to a very active nitride phase forming. Following this, catalytic measurements were undertaken with N2 pre-treatment, which also yields a highly active material.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Changes in Re-Co and Re-Re absorption pair coordination numbers in reaction gas following H2/Ar pretreatment.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,70.80,519.96,203.88,112.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
