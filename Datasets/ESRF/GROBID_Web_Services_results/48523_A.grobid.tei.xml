<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we were interested in structure determination of Mip protein from Chlamydophila pneumoniae (MipCp) and additionally from Legionella pneumoniae (MipLp) in complex with a variety of inhibitory compounds. We collected data on 21 crystals resulting in two full datasets.</p><p>Unfortunately, most crystals showed only weak diffraction properties. Still, we were able to collect 440 images for crystal VR2.6 and 170 images for crystal VR2.7. The diffraction of the crystals was less than 5 Å.</p><p>Based on these data we could determine space group and crystal cell parameters. Most likely due to the limited resolution, we were not able to determine the structure of MipCp, Due to the fact that crystallization of large, well-diffracting MipCp crystals is very difficult, we are currently optimizing the crystallization conditions. Furthermore, soaking of MipLp with inhibitory compounds to determine complex structures is in progress.</p></div>			</div>
