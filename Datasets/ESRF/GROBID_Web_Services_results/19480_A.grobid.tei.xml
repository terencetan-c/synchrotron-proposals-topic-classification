<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Neutralised polyelectrolyte networks swollen in aqueous solutions with monovalent cations undergo a volume transition when a small amount of bivalent cations are introduced into the diluent. The aim of the SC 808 experiments was to obtain information about the cation distribution in PAA gels around this transition, in swollen, intermediate and collapsed gels.</p><p>A variation of contrast was performed (anomalous SAXS) by changing the X ray wavelength just below the absorption edge of the cation in order to obtain this information. Three samples were prepared, PAASr50, PAASr100 and PAASr200 as well as electrolyte solutions having Sr2+ concentrations corresponding to the solvent included in gels. Similar gels and solutions were prepared with calcium, for which the wavelength changes do not create contrast variation. SAXS measurements in the range 9.10 -4 &lt; q(A -1 )&lt; 0.44 were performed on each sample, after having previously determined that the maximum X-ray exposure time before significant radiation damage occurs is 50 sec. By scanning in energy, the concentration in Sr2+ in each sample was determined from the absorption level.</p><p>The scattering curves obtained for the gels reveal two main components : a Debye-Bueche law at the smallest q values and an Ornstein-Zernike behaviour at larger q, or a plateau followed by a power law in q -2 . For example, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the SAXS response of PAASr200 at 15.8 keV. These results are closely similar to those we obtained from SANS measurements, which reveal the structure of the polymeric gel only. The first (OZ) term represents the thermal concentration fluctuations and the second longer range static variations due to the permanent elastic constraints inside the gel. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the values of the thermal correlation length ξ for the 3 PAASr gels obtained from SAXS as well as those obtained previously by SANS (Ref. 1). ξ displays a maximum at the transition as expected (Ref. 2).</p><p>ξ SANS (Angt) ξ SAXS (Angt) PAASr50 12 14.5 PAASr100 19.7 23.4 PAASr200 6.2 6.7</p><p>Qualitative observation of the curves obtained for a same sample at different wavelengths seems to indicate that counterions are positioned close to the chains. Effectively, changing the contrast creates a small shift along the vertical axis rather than changing the shape of the curve. The quantitative interpretation of the data is however still in progress. It is in particular necessary to determine the contrast factors for each experimental conditions in order to extract precisely the counterion contribution to the total scattering.</p><p>Ref. 1 : F.
