<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>From simultaneous transmission and total electron yield (TEY) measurements of the Cu-metal K EXAFS we find that their amplitudes at low T are dampened up to 25 % relative to the established transmission standard. All spectroscopic artefacts causing dampened EXAFS amplitudes are considered in detail and were found absent. We conclude that the "damping" is due to a thermal malfunction of the He cryostat ("Cryo III"). Using the correlated Debye-model the nominal temperatures from a thermometer at the sample platform are found to deviate up to 125 K from the actual temperature at the sample site.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The commissioning run BLC 268 was dedicated to a comparative study of the EXAFS amplitudes obtained from the total electron yield (TEY) and the standard transmission detection. Transmission and TEY EXAFS exhibit a different background behavior, resulting in complications with respect to the normalisation of the EXAFS absorption coefficient µ(E). The transmission background follows the well-known decaying Victoreen-type form, reflecting the decreasing absorption coefficient with increasing x-ray energy. In contrast the TEY background increases monotonically throughout the whole spectrum due to the increase in the flux of emitted photoelectrons and secondary electrons with x-ray energy. We have recently developed a TEY detector head operational in a continous flow He cryostat between about 4 and 300 K. It uses the He exchange gas, coupling the sample thermally to the cold head of the cryostat, also for amplification of the TEY current. Using this detection technique it is important to understand the previously observed effects of the variable cryogenic temperatures on the background of the TEY signal. The generically positive slope of the TEY background is usually corrected for during background subtraction and/or data analysis. To good approximation the correction may be done by extrapolation of the pre-edge background to an appropriate steering point at the end of the spectrum. Temperature dependent data from simultaneous TEY and transmission measurements of the Cu-K EXAFS from elemental Cu will allow us to quantify the temperature effects on the TEY background.</p><p>Unfortunately we could not carry out this experimental program so far. Using the recently installed He cryostat "Cryo III" the amplitdes of our low T transmis-sion EXAFS were found significantly dampened relative to the well established Cu metal standard. Here we show that the dampened amplitudes are due to a thermal malfunction of the Cryo III. Spectroscopic artefacts could be as well at the origin of the damping. Therefore we have carefully checked all non thermal sources able to cause the distorted EXAFS amplitudes in our measurement. This check is outlined in section 2. In section 3 we determine the actual temperatures at the sample site from a full multiple scattering analysis of the low T EXAFS and compare them with the nominal temperatures. The simultaneously measured TEY spectra will be reported and discussed in a forthcoming paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental</head><p>The K EXAFS of elemental Cu were simultaneously measured in the transmission and TEY modes, nominally between 25 K and 300 K. To do the first thing we checked the amplitudes of our transmission spectra against the well established standard data. For T = 10 -300 K these are available from many sources, for example the EXAFS data archive, or as part of the FEFF software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Precision data between 10 K and 500 K have been recently published by Fornasini et al. (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">SPECTROSCOPIC DETAILS</head><p>We have used a laminated, light tight foil of elemental Cu (BM 29 standard absorber, d 10 µm). It covered completely the rounded transmission window ( 2 × 7mm 2 ) and was fixed with adhesive Al tape on the sample plate. Silver paste at the edges of the Al tape and the sample plate bridged the insulating adhesive coating of the Al tape. Thus the lower side of the foil was put in good contact with the electrical ground of the TEY detector. A well defined electrical grounding of the detector was secured by electrical (and thus also thermal) insulation of the TEY sample plate from the platform at the lower end of the rod. An insulated needle-like electrode served as collector of the TEY.</p><p>The storage ring was operated in the hybrid mode with typically 185 mA. The vertical gap of the entrance slits was set to 0.3 mm, and the horizontal collimation to 5 mm using the experimental slits. The acquisition time was 2 s/point. We find perfect coincidence between our transmission and the archived standard spectra at 300 K (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>), but not at low T (Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref>). At 25 K the average amplitude of the EXAFS absorption coefficient χ(k) is found dampened by about 25 % relative to that of the standard at 10 K. Note that our 25 K spectrum and the 10 K standard are comparable since for T ≤ 30 K only zero point fluctuations contribute to the EXAFS amplitudes. This is clearly seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> exhibiting the standard spectra between 10 and 300 K. 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 |FT( k 2 )| χ T Reference 300 K T Platform 300 K R [Å] The perfect coincidence of our 300 K spectra with the standard indicates the absence of distorting experimental artefacts around 300 K, however not necessarily at low T . Here various spectroscopic errors may be at the origin of the damping: instable detectors, drifting detector offsets, temperature induced "leakage" effects due to filtered higher harmonics, pin holes or sample inhomogeneities, and "cutting" misalignments of the sample. In the following we discuss these effects in detail. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Linearity and Offset</head><p>For the detection we have used sealed ionization chambers filled with 260 mbar Ar (+ He) for the measurement of I, and with 100 mbar Ar (+He) for I 0 . Both chambers were operated with 600 V guaranteeing linear detection for the typical photon flux from the bending magnet. The gas pressures were found constant during the whole run. Time dependent distortive effects from the detectors can be therefore excluded.</p><p>The offsets caused by the dark current and the electrometers were automatically compensated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Higher harmonics</head><p>The white beam delivered from the bending magnet 29 was monochromatized with a double crystal monochromator of the fixed exit type. We used a pair of He cooled Si [111] crystals. Due to the crystalline symmetry of the diamond structure the Bragg condition is fullfilled for the [111], [333], reflection planes, but not for the <ref type="bibr">[222]</ref>. Thus the 1. higher harmonics around 18 keV was naturally suppressed, but not the 2. around 27 keV, and all allowed of higher order. We have moved the plane mirror device into the monochromatized beam to create a low energy bandpass cutting at E 11 keV, the upper limit of our Cu-K edge scans. The corresponding reflection angle of the mirror was 2.5 mrad. In addition we operated the double crystal monochromator in the detuned mode therewith exploiting the significantly different reflection widths of the fundamental and the higher harmonics for the suppression of the latter. With a detuning parameter of 0.5 we estimate the effective content of higher harmonics after the mirrors to be ≤ 10 -6 . Since we have used a spectroscopically thick Cu foil (optimized for the best statistical signal from an absorption step of ∆µd 2.4), the experiment was highly sensitive to distortions cryo.tex; 27/09/2006; 23:09; p.5 from a even weakly spectrally contaminated beam. To be less sensitive to the higher harmonics one usually optimizes the absorber thickness for an absorption step of ∆µd ≤ 1. Despite of the unfavorably thick absorber we have measured at 300 K the correct amplitudes (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">2</ref>), confirming the very efficient suppression of the higher harmonics. Assuming that at low T the beam has possibly hit inhomogenous or porous areas of the sample foil, or moved into blank areas of the transmission window, the dampened amplitudes of χ(k) could be attributed to not attenuated fractions of the beam (leakage). Hence the true absorption µ(E)d would be significantly distorted :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">µ (E)d = ln I 0 (E) I(E) + α(E)</formula><p>Here I(E) are the incoming, I 0 (E) the transmitted intensities of the true absorption, and α(E) the leakage, "shunting" the true absorption. Since leakage, of whatever origin, affects the total absorption, it is easily discovered in the not normalized raw spectra from a reduced height of the absorption step. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> displays the step heights as a function of temperature. They are are found constant within ±0.6%, which definitely excludes leakage is a the origin of the dampened low T χ(k). The step height of the 160 K spectrum falls apart from one standard deviation. This spectrum was measured subsequently a new injection. Obviously the monochromator drifted during the scan still towards the thermal equilibrium and thus distorted the spectrum.</p><p>2.25 2.3 2.35 2.4 2.45 2.5 0 5 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 3 0 0 Normalization factor T Head [K] cryo.tex; 27/09/2006; 23:09; p.6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">MISALIGNEMENT</head><p>At low T the beam hits the absorber at positions vertically shifted relative to that at room temperature. This effect is due to the thermal contraction of the sample rod according to ∆L = L 0 ∆T α. Here α is the thermal expansion coefficient of the rod, ∆T the temperature gradient, L 0 the thermally effective length of the rod, and ∆L the change of the length. The thermal expansion of the TEY sample rod had been measured in a previous run using Cryo II (manufacturer Oxford). Its expansion with temperature relative to T 0 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. It amounts to 0.4 mm from 0 to 300 K, that is comparable to the vertical width of the beam, and 1/5 of the vertical width of the transmission window.</p><p>0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 5 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 3 0 0 Expansion L-L 0 [mm] Temperature Sample Head [K] Hence the beam probes different sample areas at different T . If, as discussed in the previous subsection, the sample is uniform and the measurement free of leakage, sampling of different sample areas will not distort the amplitudes. But if an opaque object, such as an edge of the transmission window, moves into the beam therewith cutting a fraction of it, the absorption µd will be offset.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">µd = ln I 0 (E) I(E)</formula><p>Here is the cut fraction of the beam area. Clearly, this is a linear effect, not affecting the height of the absorption step, and not damping the amplitude of χ(E). However it deterioates the signal to noise ratio (S/N). Any tiny positional fluctuation of the incoming beam changes the effective area of the absorber, and thus modulates the absorption coefficient. Glitchies and other systematic distortions are no longer cancelled, because the parasitic components in the monochromatic beam are cut</p><p>cryo.tex; 27/09/2006; 23:09; p.7</p><p>as well and no longer compensated through the ratio of I 0 (E) with I(E). And if the beam position drifts with increasing energy, the slope of the background will be affected, too. This "cutting" type of misalignement is easily seen in the raw data: the absorption is offset, the height of the absoroption step stays unaltered, but the S/N is significantly deterioated. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> displays the Cu K absorption at 300 K (blue) and at "23 K" (green). The low T " spectrum is offset by δµd +0.4 indicating that about 50 % of the sample area is cut from the transmission. The S/N ratio is deterioated, and the glitchie around 9.9 KeV significantly enhanced. But the height of the absorption step stays unaltered, confirming the very effective suppression of the higher harmonics. Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> displays some spectra of the temperature cycle: 300 K (blue) → "23 K" (green) → 290 K (black). We find a hysteresis of the offset, most probably due to a different thermal overall state of the cryostat after cycling. The temperature of the coldhead, T coldhead , was 87 K at the beginning, and 47 K at the end of the cycle. Subseqent to the cycle we have isothermally changed the vertical sample position, nominally by -0.2 mm, therewith deliberately moving the lower edge of the transmission window into the beam. The offset of this 300 K (red) spectrum is found identical with that of the thermally displaced "23 K" (green) spectrum ! Notably the two step heights coincide, as well as the background and noise patterns due to the "cutting effect". And not unexpected the amplitudes of the isothermally displaced 300 K (red) spectrum coincide with the standard data of Newville et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 8.5 9 9.5 1 0 10.5 1 1 11.5 1 2 µ d E [KeV]</p><p>23 K @ -L 0 ∆T mm 300 K @ -0.2 mm 290 K @ ≈0 mm 300 K @ 0 mm α Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">CRYOGENIC DETAILS</head><p>The transmission K EXAFS of elemental Cu are the experimental standard for the spectroscopic quality of x-ray absorption measurements in the energy range around 9 KeV. Its T dependence has been analyzed with high accuracy, too. Good agreement of its thermal behavior with lattice models is already found using the simplifying Einstein ansatz, or the more elaborate correlated Debye ansatz (2), and with thermal expansion data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The low T regime between 10 and 300 K is well described by Θ D = 317 K, in good agreement with the tabulated number of 320 K. Here Θ D is the Debye temperature. Hence the T dependent EXAFS data of elemental Cu may be used as an in situ thermometer, either simply by measurements of the nearest neighbor Debye-Waller factor, σ 2 nn (T ), or more elaborately by multiple scattering fits to the correlated Debye model.</p><p>The TEY sample rod (modified Oxford model) was operated in the sample tube of the He cryostat Cryo III. Therein cooling of the sample is achieved by static He exchange gas transporting the heat of the sample towards the heat sink at the bottom plate connected with the cold head. A calibrated Lake Shore Si diode inserted in a hole of the sample platform (containing also the resistive heaters) was used for the remote controlled temperature settings (T platf orm ) and served also as thermometer for the nominal temperature at the sample site. The position of the sample site was about 17.4 mm below the sample platform, and 32.3 mm above the heat sink at the bottom of the sample tube (in vertical direction). Due to the exchange gas cooling the temperature gradient between the sample site and the sample platform was expected to be negligably small, and to have a positive sign.

The fit matches also the 300 K reference spectrum co-plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.   Applying the correlated Debye model to the analysis of our measurements we have used Θ D = 326 K as input (from the fits to the archived reference data). We thus obtained the actual in situ temperatures from our data. Plotting the Debye-Wallers factors σ 2 (triangles in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">16</ref>) vs. these in situtemperatures we obtain a Debye behavior in agreement with the reference data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>We have shown that the dampened EXAFS amplitudes in our low T data have to be sought in a malfunction of the cryostat, cooling the sample site to only 150 K while the sample platform is at 25 K. Notably the strong temperature gradient between the sample site and the sample platform has a negative sign. Although closer to the heat sink, the sample site is found significantly warmer than the more distant sample platform. This could be simply due to wrong temperature readings, but the calibrated Lake Shore Si diode can be safely assumed to have operated correctly. Fits to the temperature dependent data of this measurement using this number yield their true temperature (blue triangles).</p><p>The pressure of the exchange gas environment (p tube,300 K ≥ 64 mbar, measured at room temperature) was sufficiently high for its heat conduction to be independent on pressure: Q ∝ N He /Λ. Here Q is the heat current, N He the number of helium atoms per unit volume, and Λ their mean free path. Increasing pressure will increase n He but equally decrease Λ. Thus the heat conduction of the dense gas is almost pressure independent. Pressure dependence however occurs at low densities where Λ &gt; d (Knudsen regime). Here d are the geometrical dimensions of the vessel, typically 50 mm. The corresponding He pressure for Λ ≥ 50 mm is p c ≤ 1.5 × 10 -3 mbar at 4 K. p tube,300 K = 64 mbar corresponds to a reduced pressure at He temperatures: p tube,4 K = 4/300 × 64 0.85 mbar &gt;&gt; p c . Thus the sample site is equally well thermally coupled to the exchange gas at all temperatures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The local negative temperature gradient is most likely caused by a thermal shunt between the sample site and an only locally effective heat source. Local heating by the weak 50 pA ionisation current of the TEY detector can be safely discarded. But the sample area may be thermally shunted by the thermal radiation flowing onto the sample environment through the four especially large and thermally unscreened optical windows of ordinary Kapton foil. The clearance of these also thermally transparent x-ray windows was choosen so large that the heating of the exchange gas may be locally constrained to the sample site. Screening by the colder sample tube is not effctive because of the large windows. On the other hand side the sample platform beyond the sample site is completely screened by the closed sample tube. Thus the He exchange at the sample platform may adapt lower temperatures than the locally heated sample site, although the former is more distant from the heat sink at the bottom of the sample tube.</p></div>			</div>
