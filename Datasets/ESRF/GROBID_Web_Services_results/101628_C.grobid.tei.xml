<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Understanding of the crystallization behaviour and kinetics of cocoa butter and cocoa butter equivalents for rational design of more sustainable chocolate products </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>For the experiments we used the rheometer setup available on ID02. We chose the sample holder in polymeric material as it was better for heat transfer. It was clear after a few trials that the cooling capacity of the system was not sufficient. In fact, the Peltier was not able to quickly cool down below 25°C. Since we work with mixtures of edible triglycerides (TAGs) that are industrially crystallized at 15°C, this lower temperature was not sufficient. We then decided to increase the cooling capacity by flowing cold air on the sample holder. The air was coming from the hutch compressed air line and cooling was achieved by flowing it in a heat exchanger where the cold medium was water at 5°C from a chiller. We had to adjust the distance of the tube of flowing air to avoid local cold spots on the sample holder but after a few trials we managed to achieve the correct cooling capacity and reasonable uniformity. As a note for the beamline scientists, it might be useful to have a setup of the rheometer that can cool down fast and at temperature lower than ambient. This might be useful for soft matter people that work with food or pharmaceutical formulations like myself.</p><p>A photo of the setup is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The different mixtures of TAGs were loaded in the sample holder after melting a 50°C. The temperature was increased to 65°C and then a cooling rate of -2°C/min to 22-23°C was applied. In terms of shear we used 1000 s-1, which was a typical value reported in the literature for these systems. To test the effect of shear we repeated the same experiment with and without shear. It was clear that shearing promoted nucleation and had a dramatic effect on the kinetics of polymorphic transformation, particularly in favour of the most stable polymorph β. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the crystallization behaviour of cocoa butter (CB) with and without shear. While the nucleation temperature is very similar (around 24°C) the polymorphic behaviour is very different. In the case without shear the first crystal structure to appear is the α form, followed by the β', which is still present after 1.5 hr of experiment. For this experiment we did not observed the more stable β crystal, consistently with our previous experiments in capillaries (smaller volume but still no shear). The stable polymorph appear after about an hour of the sheared experiments and grows very quickly at expense of the co-existing α polymorph. Interestingly the β' polymorph is not observed (perhaps it exists only in traces) for this experimental conditions. Slower cooling rates of -1 and -0.5°C/min were tested with the same sample and level of shear and similar behaviour was observed.</p><p>In fact, the tendency to transform quickly to the β polymorph, without the nucleation and growth of the β', in the presence of shear was observed also in the cocoa butter equivalent (CBEs) samples (at different chemical composition compared to CB). This indicates that this is a genuine effect of the shear and does no depend on the CBE composition.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the comparison of sheared and not sheared crystallization for three different CBEs. S1 is more reach in TAGs coming from stearic acid, S2 has a higher concentration of palmitic acid while S7 present a mixture of PPO and SSS together with the characteristic TAGs of CB (POP, SOS and POS). Finally, sample S13 do not contain trisaturated fats but it present a significant amount (&gt;1% w/w) of PPO, which can form a molecular compound with POP. In all cases, similarly to CB the shear promote the formation of the stable β polymorph. For sample S2 the β structure appears after about an hour of experiment and without the nucleation of the β' (only the liquid crystalline phase α is visible). Without shear the stable form is not observed, even after 2 hrs of isothermal conditions. For sample S1, in unsheared conditions several polymorphs are observed (α, γ, β(3L), β'(3L), β'(2L)), in agreement with previous data collection. For the sheared experiment only the most unstable γ, and β'(3L) structures are not visible and the transformation towards the β(3L) is faster. In the case of S7 and S13 the β(3L) polymorph appears earlier compared to the unsheared conditions and the absence of the β'(2L) is evident, similarly to CB. For these two samples a stable 2L structure (immiscible with the 3L form) is visible and appears earlier in sheared conditions compared to the non-sheared ones. This polymorph has a high melting temperature, even higher than the β(3L) structure, indicating that it might be a β(2L) polymorph.</p><p>It is still unclear the nature of this structure, as a 2L arrangement of a β polymorph is relatively uncommon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAMPLE S1 SAMPLE S7 SAMPLE S2</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: comparison of sheared and non-sheared crystallization</p><p>For S7 (and other samples tested such as S8) the presence of trisaturated TAGs (SSS or PPP), which are immiscible with the cocoa butter TAGs might be reason for this extra solid phase. In fact, the high melting point of trisaturated TAGs might be the explanation for the high melting point of this polymorph. However, sample S13 also present a high melting 2L structure but there are no trisaturated TAGs present. In this case, it is possible that this solid phase correspond to a PPO/POP molecular compound (which exist in a 2L arrangement). However, the melting point reported in the literature for this polymorph is around 30°C, much lower than what observed experimentally. Perhaps this structure is a solid solution containing also SOS, which might increase the melting point. A comparison of the d-spacings and the estimation of the electron density profile might help clarifying this problem.</p><p>In conclusion, it is very evident that the presence of shear significantly speeds up the transformation towards the more stable β polymorphs (3L and 2L) and inhibits the nucleation of the β' metastable form (2L). This is an interesting observation and more investigation is ongoing.</p><p>Finally, the use of the rheometer allowed to monitor the viscosity of the samples during crystallization. Nucleation was detected by a large change in viscosity while polymorphic transformations were not easily detected. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows some viscosity trends, the formation of the liquid crystalline phase α generate a very little change in viscosity while the formation of β structures (2 and 3L) is characterized by a more significant change due to both the higher amount of crystals and the rigidity of this structure compared to the α form. </p></div>
