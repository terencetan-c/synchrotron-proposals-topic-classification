<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This aim of this experiment was to observe the orbital rotation in Pr(Sr 0.1 Ca 0.9 ) 2 Mn 2 O 7 using soft x-ray diffraction. In the main this experiment was highly successful; a strong resonant signal was observed at the (0,0.5,0) positions which was then seen to move to the (0.5,0,0) position below the orbital transition. High resolution energy spectra were taken of these resonances, showing a highly complex Mn L edge resonance.</p><p>Thermally induced rotation of 3d orbital stripes in Pr(Sr 0.1 Ca 0.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There were a few minor experimental issues. Initially the Keitheley currently anplyfier was very noisy, which made it very difficult to locate the reflection. When this current amplyfier was replaced by a different current amplifier / v to f, the signal to noise ratio on the reflection increased by around two orders of magnitude.</p><p>Secondly, a failiure in one of the in-vacuum sample translation stages prevented us from taking azimuths of the reflections. For this reason we have delayed publishing the results until this could be undertaken. These measurements have now been taken at Diamond, and the work will be submitted for publication shortly. The next page shows the first page of the paper to be submitted, of which a draft is completed.</p><p>The application of the semicovalent exchange theory to the manganite series 1 initiated the drive to observe and understand the charge and orbital ordering and their complex interaction with magnetic order <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> . Recently this research has developed to investigate the possibilities of controlling and exploiting these order parameters, developing the fields of spintronics and orbitronics 5 . The mediation of the orbital state has been pioneered through applying strain to tetragonal La 1-x (Sr,Ca) x MnO 3 thin films, coupling the Jahn-Teller distortions to the uniaxial strain 6,7 . This causes a preferential occupancy of the mangenese 3d orbitals in a single direction.</p><p>In this communication we observe the thermal switching of occupied orbitals in Pr(Sr 0.1 Ca 0.9 ) 2 Mn 2 O 7 using soft x-ray diffraction at the Mn L 2,3 edges. This means we are directly sensitive to Mn 3d electron orbitals through the resonant enhancement of the 2p → 3d dipole transition. Unlike many manganites, Pr(Sr 0.1 Ca 0.9 ) 2 Mn 2 O 7 crystalizes into the orthorhombic spacegroup, Amam, with lattice parameters a = 5.410 Å, b = 5.462 Å, c = 19.277 Å at 405 K. This orthorhombic lattice, above the orbital order transition, has been shown to confine the formation of the orbital order to a single stripe direction 8-10 . Through investigations of the anisotropic optical response, supported by electron and x-ray diffraction measurements, it was concluded that the lone e g electron orbitals of the Mn 3+ ions order into stripes along the a-axis below T OO1 , 370 K (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As the system is cooled below T OO2 , 300 K, these orbital stripes re-orientate such that the stripes now run along the b-axis. Although there is a small structural change both at T OO1 and T OO2 the system remains orthorhombic throughout.</p><p>Below the onset of orbital order (T OO1 ), the space group is more properly described as P bnm, followed by a further transition to Am2m at T OO2 . However, for clarity throughout the paper we will refer to the orbital reflections as indexed in the Amam spacegroup.</p><p>Samples of Pr(Sr 0.1 Ca 0.9 ) 2 Mn 2 O 7 were grown at the University of Oxford using the floating zone technique <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref> . Small high quality samples were selected and prealigned with a rotating anode x-ray source. Two such samples, aligned with the indistinguishable (at low resolution) a-,b-axis surface normal, were polished to a mirror-like surface with 0.25 µm diamond suspension. Prior to the soft x-ray diffraction experiment these samples were studied with non-resonant (9.26 keV) high resolution x-ray diffraction at BM28, ESRF. This showed both samples to be twinned, through a 90 • rotation, with reflections from each domain being approximately equal. Raster scanning the samples did not preferentially select either domain, suggesting that the domains were much smaller than the incident x-ray beam (100 × 300 µm). The sample giving the cleanest diffraction signal was then mounted in the in-vacuum six circle x-ray diffractometer on beamline ID08, ESRF. Diffraction measurements were undertaken using a horizontally polarized x-ray beam, provided by a single APPLE II undulator with an energy</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIG. 1: Schematic of the orbital stripes running along the a-axis below TOO1, and along the b-axis below TOO2.
