<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Pressure-induced metallization and molecular dissociation of oxygen, 0,, with molecular magnetism have attracted special interest because of novel electronic and magnetic properties of the high-pressure phases. Determination of the structural properties of these phases is indispensable for understanding the electromagnetic properties. Recently, by using a high-brilliance beam of ESRF, we have observed a new structural transition from the E to 5 phase at 96 GPa corresponding to metAization[ 11. Further studies on high-pressure phases of solid oxygen were carried out as follow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Research for molecular dissociation</head><p>Powder difiaction patterns, which were obtained at pressure up to 15 1 GPa by an angledispersive method with h=O.42498L, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The transition to the 5 phase at 96 GPa reappears in the figure. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the pressure dependence of the d-values of the diffaction peaks. The present data well agree with previous ones[ 11. Both results above 96 GPa indicate none of sign for a structural transition. To determine and refine the structure of the 5 phase the lines from a metal gasket ought to be removed from the pattern. Further experiments at higher pressure are needed for observation of molecular dissociation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Reitveld refinement of the E phase</head><p>The space group of C2/m has been proposed for the E phase but the atomic positional parameter are not determined. For Reitveld refinement of the E phase, a high-quality powder diffraction patterns were obtained at 13.7,17 and 2 1 GPa and a structural analysis was done. A possible arrangement of oxygen molecules in the unit cell shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> was proposed. Then the intermolecular distance of 0, was fixed at 1.2A. But strong preferred-orientation of the sample was difficult to further reline the structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Single-crystal analysis of the E phase</head><p>The single crystal of the E phase was grown under a condition of 20 GPa and 650 K in a DAC for the crystal structure analysis. A preliminary experiment was carried out by oscillating the sample and Bragg reflections from the single crystal were observed. It is clear now that the singlecrystal analysis of the k phase is feasible.</p><p>[I] YAkahama et al. Phys. Rev.Lett. 74(1995)4690.</p></div>		</body>
