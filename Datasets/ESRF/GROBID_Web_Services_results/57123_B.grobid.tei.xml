<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Interaction of hydrogen with uranium is an important issue for its applications in nuclear energy and for understanding magnetism in U and similar (Ce, Pu) systems <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Uranium hydrides provide a tool to observe an impact of expansion of the U lattice, allowing formation of U moments and their ferromagnetic ordering. Starting from (bcc) γ-U alloys using doping (Zr, Mo), rapid splat cooling and high-pressure synthesis different varieties of UH 3 were prepared <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. Whereas (UH 3 ) 1-x Zr x can be obtained in a form of (20 nm) nanocrystallites with   -UH 3 cubic structure, analogous pure Mo-alloyed UH 3 is almost amorphous corresponding to very purely (1 nm) nanocrystalline material with  -UH 3 l ike structure. Despite of these differences in atomic and micro-structure both types of hydrides behave similarly as ferromagnets with Curie temperature T C ≈ 170-200 K. The main reason why 5f magnetism arises (U metal is a weak Pauli paramagnet) can be seen in the U-U spacing. This is enhanced in UH 3 to the proximity of the Hill limit, at which the ordering of U moments can set in due to the 5f band narrowing. A striking phenomena observed in (UH 3 ) 1-x Zr x by XRD is a large volume magnetostriction. Similar abnormalities in temperature dependence of U-spacing are expected in (UH 3 ) 1-x Mo x . In order to get detailed information about inter-atomic spacing in UH 3 , explore magnetostriction in Mo-alloyed UH 3 and investigate possible size effect, a pair distribution function (PDF) study was done in ID22. Two sets of Zr and Mo-alloyed samples with 3 dopping levels were prepared. Each sample was mixed with acetone solutable (UHU) glue and encapsulated in a midsection of a polymide (kapton) tube (ID 0.81 mm). The ends of the tube were sealed by Stycast. Experiment was done using x-ray energy 80 keV and additional beam focusing with transfocators. Forward scattering from a spinning capillary in transmission mode was registered by a large 16MPixel Perkin Elmer a-Si Detector. Nitrogen cryostrem was used in temperature range 80-300 K. Azimuthal integration of 2D data was done by PyFAI and PDF conversion of XRD patterns by PDFgetX3. Thanks to sample transparency for high energy x-rays Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: 2D image data and integrated XRD pattern from (UH 3 ) 0.7 Zr 0.3 sample. and strong scattering from uranium, patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) have good statistics (up to Q max = 2/d ≈ 30 Å -1 ) and resolution giving an excellent quality PDF (up to r max &gt;&gt; 40 Å).</p><p>Magnetostriction effect in the temperature dependence of lattice parameter of -type (UH 3 ) 1-x Zr x and similar features in inter-atomic distances of -type Mo-alloyed UH 3 are evident in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Fine details (step-like changes in raw data) of inter-atomic spacing analysis in Mo-UH 3 are nontrivial. Because of very poor crystallinity of hydride it is difficult to omit instrumental aberrations. However the effect is always close to T C and there are correlations with room temperature lattice parameter and Mo-content. Other arguments are geometrical restrains onto uranium atoms in the -UH 3 structure (see later).</p><p>Comparison of PDF data of Zr and Mo-alloyed UH 3 demonstrates clearly differences (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) between    and  -type structures (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) as well as similarities in the closest U-U spacing giving new insight into the origin of the magnetic ordering. In order to get fine structural details XRD patterns and PDFs were fitted by a hybrid approach in reciprocal and direct space using MSTRUCT and DiffPy.xPDFsuite. Impurities (UO 2 and ZrC) in (UH 3 ) 1-x Zr x and a situation -UH 3 is always present in a mixture with -phase present complications for analysis but already basic fitting gives excellent results (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).
