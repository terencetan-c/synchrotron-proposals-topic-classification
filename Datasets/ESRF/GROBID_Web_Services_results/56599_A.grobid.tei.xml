<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed an experiment entitled "Probing structural dynamics of myoglobin using site-specific iodine labeling scheme" at the ID09B beamline. We labeled iodine atoms on the surface cysteines in sperm whale myoglobin (swMb) mutants (G5C-D60C, D60C-K102C, and D60C-K147C). Iodine-labeled swMb mutants were successfully prepared, dialyzed against 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer with pH 7.0, and concentrated to 8 mM. In order to extract the principal components (PCs) of the data at late time delays, we collected scattering data at the following time points; -10 ns, 1</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Probing structural dynamics of myoglobin using sitespecific iodine labeling scheme</p><p>Experiment number: SC-4115 Beamline: ID09B Date of experiment: from: 06/05/2015 to: 11/05/2015 Date of report: 25/09/2015 Shifts: 15 Local contact(s): Michael Wulff Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Michael Wulff (*), ESRF, Grenoble, France Hyotcherl Ihee (*), Department of Chemistry, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea Youngmin Kim (*), Department of Chemistry, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea Junbeom Jo (*), Department of Chemistry, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea Sungjun Park (*), Department of Chemistry, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea DeokbeomSuh (*), Department of Chemistry, KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea</p><p>The difference curves show a distinctive feature between the iodine-labeled swMb mutant and the unlabeled swMb mutant. We presume that this variation is due to the scattering contribution from the two iodine atoms labeled on the two surface cysteine residue.</p><p>Preliminary analysis using singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component (PC) analysis was employed; we extracted the principal components (PCs) for the late time delay of the labeled and unlabeled Mb mutants. First, the scattering data from the unlabeled mutants and the wild type Mb were compared. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows a comparison of the PC results for the wild type, mutant, and iodine-labeled mutant. The PCs of the unlabeled Mb mutants (K120C-D60C, G5C-D60C) and the wild type Mb were identical within the signal-to-noise ratio, confirming that the surface mutation process and subsequent attachment of linkers do not appreciably affect the structure change (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref>). On the other hand, comparison between the PCs of the iodine-labeled myoglobin mutants and the unlabeled mutants shows a noticeable difference due to the contribution of scattering from the two iodine atoms (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>). In addition, the PCs of various Mb mutants that were iodine labeled show that the samples with different labeled positions yield different curves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>). Specifically, the iodine-labeled K147C-D60C mutant (blue) shows a greater difference.</p><p>This result strongly supports the idea that the two iodine atoms on the surface of the swMb mutant alter the scattering patterns and reveal the applicability of the site-specific iodine-labeling method. So, we can confidently state that the iodine labeling scheme will help us obtain more information about intermediate structures during structural transitions.</p><p>In conclusion, we collected and analyzed time-resolved X-ray solution scattering data for iodine labeled swMb mutants at several late time delays and investigated the applicability of the iodine labeling method. Accumulating the scattering curves, which were derived from various iodine-labeled protein sets, will greatly increase the structural information contents and allow a refining of the calculated structure. Therefore, we will be able to analyze the intermediate protein structures with high reliability due to the increased information about changes in the protein structure after through iodine labeling method. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
