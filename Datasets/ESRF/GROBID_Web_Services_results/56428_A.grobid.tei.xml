<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Introduction</head><p>This project focuses on the blanching of easel paintings, a recurring alteration that can affect the varnish layer and also the paint layer itself. The chemical and physical phenomena responsible for the whitening have not yet been identified and this is currently being investigated as PhD research work, at the C2RMF (Center for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France). Current conservation treatments are not entirely satisfactory. Understanding this alteration will therefore allow the proposal of adapted, efficient and durable conservation treatments.</p><p>Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy observations of circa 50 non-embedded paint microsamples revealed an highly porous structure in the altered layers with a pore size ranging from 20 nm to 4µm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Nevertheless, our observations are limited to the surface or the edge of the sample and do not reflect the whole porosity distribution. Besides, the samples cannot be embedded because the pores would be filled in by the resin penetrating into the sample.</p><p>Our objective is to determine the 3D spatial distribution of the pores, their sizes, 3D morphologies and their chemical environments in order to better understand the alteration process. Analyses were performed on the nano-imaging beamline ID16A-NI using nano-holotomography in combinaison with nano-X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The use of phase contrast nanotomography was required since it enables to access a nanometric spatial resolution, and especially to distinguish regions with low and similar electron densities (pores, binder, varnish) in presence of high density compounds (pigments with iron, copper, lead, …). XRF 2D maps were collected to track possible traces of metals (potentially used as driers) and to see if their distribution is correlated with the degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental part</head><p>• Samples A corpus composed of 8 paint micro-samples were analyzed by nano-holotomography and 4 samples also by nano-X-ray fluorescence (XRF) (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). To avoid the sample contamination by organic matter, they were pushed and blocked in quartz capillaries (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, left). As they were not well fixed, they moved during the scans. So, we finally decided to stick them with the least amount of araldite glue (viscous enough to not penetrate in the whole sample). The yellow cross corresponds to the analyzed area (located on the opposite side of the glue) (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, right). It is important to underline that a sample shrinking was induced by the beam and corrected using algorithm during the reconstruction process.</p></div>

Except for one, samples were imaged only with a voxel size of 50 nm because it enables a good compromise between the spatial resolution and the analyzed field of view (more than 100x100x100 µm 3 ) (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> The XRF 2D maps were collected in the meantime (average over the beam path) with an energy of 17 keV as well, a spatial resolution of 50 nm and an exposure time of 50 ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>Three dimensional images were obtained from retrieved phase maps by tomographic reconstruction. The image processing was performed using the sofwares ImageJ and Mevislab®. A detail of a reconstructed slice of the sample "van der Bent (altered)" is reported in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. It highlights that the pores (in red) are located in the binder (in green). The results obtained on other samples are consistant. Considering the pore size (from circa 200 nm to 4 µm), the blanching is induced by the Mie light scattering by the pores located either in the varnish or in the organic binder <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This results constitute a major advance toward the understanding of the alteration, since it revealed that the alteration process takes place in the organic matter. The analyses of the 3D images revealed that the pores are closed (not connected) and therefore hard to access from the painting surface during conservation treatments (solvents application and varnishing). Indeed, the comparative study of an altered and a conserved sample, revealed that pores are still present in the binder and that current conservation treatments are therefore not efficient to durably fill or resorb them. (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>The sample 3D characterizations enables us to highligh that the pore are located in the organic matter: in the varnish or in the binder. The pore size is ranging from 200 nm to 4 µm. Concerning the 3D distribution in the layers, the pores are not connected and located throughout the layers. Moreover, the comparative study revaled that current conservation treatments are not satisfactory. These results constitute a major advance towards the understanding of the alteration and the proposal of new appropriate conservation treatments, which remains an important issue for the conservations of these paintings.</p><p>The high quality of the results obtained (more detailed in a future publication) encourages us to continue our research on conservation treatments for blanched easel paintings. More specifically, we wish to focus on the efficiency and reversibility of a new developped treatment based on a perfluoropolyether gel. We thus plan to submit a continuation of this experiment at ID16A.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Detail of a reconstructed slice highlighting the presence of pores in the organic binder.
