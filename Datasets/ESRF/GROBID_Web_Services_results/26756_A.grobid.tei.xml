<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Metastable crystallization products during solidification of undercooled Nd-Fe-B melts have investigated by energy-dispersive diffraction experiments on samples that were containerlessly processed by electromagnetic levitation. During our previous experiment HS-1740 on B-rich Nd-Fe-B alloys (at compositions used for high-performance permanent magnets based on the hard magnetic Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 (Φ) phase) it was found that in the undercooled melt a metastable ternary phase is preferently formed and that it triggers the crystallization of the stable Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 phase. The metastable phase can either be formed as a peritectic phase from properitectic γ-Fe or as the primary solidifying phase in the deeply undercooled melt. Due to the rhombohedral symmetry of the metastable phase it was concluded that the structure is similar the stable binary Nd 2 Fe 17 phase. In order to elucidate the relation between the stable Nd 2 Fe 17 phase and metastable ternary phase in Nd-Fe-B alloys, in the present experiments binary Nd-Fe alloys and the effect of the addition of boron on phase formation have been investigated on 8 different alloy compositions. Diffraction spectra with an integration time between 5 to 10 seconds were taken in sequence during cooling and solidification as well as during the subsequent heating and remelting of crystalline phases. The temperature of the sample is measured by a pyrometer during the entire experiment cycle. Binary Nd 12.5 Fe 87.5 alloys solidify primarily in fcc-Fe (γ) as the properitectic phase which is followed by the crystallization of the Nd 2 Fe 17 phase as the peritectic phase. The Bragg peaks of the crystallizing Nd 2 Fe 17 phase in binary Nd-Fe and that of the metastable ternary phase in Nd-Fe-B alloys of all compositions investigated can be indexed on the same rhombohedral crystal structure as revealed by stable the Nd 2 Fe 17 phase at room temperature (prototype Zn 2 Th 17 ). The lattice constants of both Nd 2 Fe 17 and the metastable ternary phase obtained from diffraction spectra at the same temperature are quite similar. These results suggest a composition of Nd 2 Fe 17 (B) (in the following denoted as χ) for the metastable phase, i.e. it reveals the same Zn 2 Th 17 -type crystal with B atoms at interstitial lattice sites similar to the C atoms as known for the stable Nd 2 Fe 17 (C) compound.  By the addition of small amounts of B to Nd-Fe alloys the ternary Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 compound occurs as a second peritectic phase. The in-situ diffraction experiments during cooling of a Nd 12.3 Fe 86.3 B 1.4 alloy in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show the sequence of crystallizing phases, i.e. γ-Fe, Nd 2 Fe 17 (or Nd 2 Fe 17 (B) = χ ) and the Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 phase. Both peritectic phases remain in the solidified sample and disappear only when heating in the reversal sequence at the peritectic temperature T P (Φ), T P (χ) and the liquidus temperature T L (γ), respectively. From this observation it is concluded that both the Nd 2 Fe 17 (B) and Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 are thermodynamically stable. With increasing B concentration of the alloy the Nd 2 Fe 17 (B) phase becomes metastable as it is shown by the results on alloys with 4 at. % B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Under equilibrium conditions these alloys exhibit a single peritecticum with the stable Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 as the peritectic phase. As it was found in the previous experiments on B-rich alloys (HS-1740) the formation of the peritectic Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 phase is frequently suppressed and does not always set in at the peritectic temperature T P (Φ). Instead, the metastable phase is formed below T P (Φ) followed by the crystallization of the stable peritectic phase in the residual liquid that is still undercooled. The deviation from the thermodynamic equilibrium is revealed the steep temperature rise (recalescence) of the sample to the solidification temperature of Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 when the heat of fusion is released (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, between period (b) and (c)). Now the spectrum reveals the Bragg peaks exlusively of the phases Φ and γ while those of the Nd 2 Fe 17 (B) phase are vanishing. The Φ-phase disappears only when reheating to T P (Φ). Apparantly, the Nd 2 Fe 17 (B) phase is metastable with a lifetime limited to some seconds.</p><p>From the diffraction experiments it can be concluded that the metastable phase in Nd-Fe-B alloys is a ternary extension of the stable Nd 2 Fe 17 phase with a similar crystal structure, i.e. the ordered Zn 2 Th 17 -type structure. The ordered structure can be identified by the presence of the superstructure (024)-reflection whereas it disappears for its disordered modification that is known to be of the hexagonal Tb 1 Cu 7 -type.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Sequence of the crystallizing phases γ-Fe, stable χ (Nd 2 Fe 17 (B)) and stable Φ (Nd 2 Fe 14 B 1 ) and the corresponding temperature-time profile.
