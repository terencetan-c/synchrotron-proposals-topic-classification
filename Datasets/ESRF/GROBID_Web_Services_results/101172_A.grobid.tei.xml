<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Expected results in the proposal</head><p>Our proposal is based on the crystallization and phase transition peaks observed on our DSC curve, as well as the reported hcp ground state in the reference. We believe that amorphous CrMnFeCoNi likely possesses a hcplike local atomic structure, which would indicate that the amorphous phase should undergo successive transformations into hcp and fcc phases upon heating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results and the conclusions of the study</head><p>Thanks to the assistance of the ID31 beamline staff at ESRF, we were able to successfully conduct in-situ heating high-energy X-ray diffraction. Surprisingly, our findings show that the amorphous phase transforms firstly into a metastable bcc phase, and then into a high-temperature fcc phase, without experiencing hcp phase (as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A updated phase diagram is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. These results are particularly inspiring, as the bcc phase has yet to be reported experimentally. Moreover, we observed that both high-temperature bcc and fcc phases can be quenched to room temperature, indicating that they have equal or similar energy levels. This motivated us to perform theoretical calculations, as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, which revealed that a ferrimagnetic bcc phase has comparable energy to the paramagnetic fcc phase, in good agreement with our experimental findings. Fig. 2 A updated diagram based on the in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction conducted at ID31 beamline. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Publication</head><p>Currently, our work is still in progress as we plan to measure high-pressure XMCD to reveal the crucial role of magnetism in amorphous and bcc CrMnFeCoNi HEA. We are eager to submit our paper in the near future and share our findings with the scientific community.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 in-situ heating high-energy X-ray diffraction of amorphous CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy.
