<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Gamma-crystallins are a family of closely related, long-lived proteins that occur at high protein concentrations inside lens fibre cells. In the human lens the gammaD member is expressed during foetal life. Several human genetic cataracts have been linked to point mutations in the gammaD-crystallin gene. Some of these mutations cause congenital cataract by altering the protein solubility and leading to crystallization in the lens. Protein crystallography is an excellent method to assess both the intramolecular and intermolecular structural consequences of these kinds of mutations. In a previous trip we collected diffraction data from crystals of recombinant human gamma-D crystallin that carried the mutation for aculeiform cataract.</p><p>In this trip we collected diffraction data from crystals of recombinant native protein that diffracted to 1.25A resolution. The structures for both the native and the mutant (which was collected in a previous trip) was solved by molecular replacement using bovine gammaDcrystallin as search molecule. The molecular and lattice structures of the native and mutant human gammaD crystals are currently being analysed. </p></div>			</div>
