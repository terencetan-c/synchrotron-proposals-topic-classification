<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Partial Report of Mx/1541 ID29 (16-02-2014 / 17-02-2014):</p><p>This up-dated report corresponds to the data collected at ID29 (+ID23) during the second round of Mx1541. We brought 160 samples from the different team grouped as CSIC-UGR and UAL. All the samples were tested and the main results are listed below. Crystals from CSIC-UGR: i) LBD-McpS bounded to several ligands. It was pointed it out on the proposal and in previous reports we kept searching for crystal of sufficient quality to undoubtedly identified the ligands (benzoate, citrate, etc.) bound to the near and distal pockets of the ligand binding domain of McpS. In previous opportunities (Mx1406) we have been able to collect data beyond 3.17 Å (McpS-Bz), the maximum resolution we have reached preciously. At ID29 we have definitively improved the resolution limit. We have collected 6 full data sets, several with resolution below 3.0 Å being the best 2.64 Å for the complex McpS-Ct and 2.3 Å for the complex McpS-Bz. We expect to get useful 3D structures in both cases.</p><p>Table 1 ID29 (Benzoate (Bz) Malate (Ml) Acetate (Ac) Citrate (Ct) Tartrate (Tr)) Protein N. Crys.

The chemotaxis of P. aeruginosa to different amino acids is mediated by three paralogous chemoreceptors termed PctA, PctB and PctC.</p><p>We have shown recently that PctA, PctB and PctC bind to 17, 5 and 2 amino acids, respectively, and mediate corresponding chemotactic responses <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We also showed that the neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyrate (GABA) binds to PctC with much higher affinity than the two amino acids being the first to identify a GABA chemoreceptor although its physiological relevance remains to be established. To elucidate the way of binding of these co-factors, we have produced crystals of PctA, PctB and PctC pre-incubated with several of their natural ligands. Preliminary results from ID14-4 (ESRF) have already been pubished [2] but improved diffraction quality for other protein-ligands is undergoing. We have collected data to high resolution of the PctA-Ile (P2 1 2 1 2 1 : 70.28 <ref type="bibr">77.04 115.676, to 2.15 Å and P61: 132.50, 132.50, 76</ref>.97 to 2.2 Å) and PctA-Trp (P2 1 2 1 2 1 : 72.1, 116.4, 78.4 to 2.25 Å) and at lower resolution in the case of PctB-Arg (P3 1 21: 111.6, 111.6, 117.5 to 3.1 Å) complex all of them from previos data allocation slots (Mx1406 (ESRF) and Proxima I (SOLEIL)). The three structures are under refinement and will be part of an article in preparation. We have included an example of PctA binding pocket bunded to isoleucine (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Following this line several crystal of the PctA incubated with isoleucine and tryptophane and PctC plus GABA were tested. The results are sumarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. In the case of PctC-GABA co-crystals, several data sets were collected at resolution near 2.0 Å of crystals belonging to the P321 (77. <ref type="bibr">41, 77.41, 67.41, 90, 90, 120)</ref> space group and are been used for MR solutions search using the refined structures of PctA.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

The structure was obtained by MR from data collected at ID14-1 (Mx1406) and the manuscript is in preparation.</p><p>Table 2 ID29 (Tryptophan (Trp), Isoleucine (Ile), Acid Gamma Amino Butirico (GABA)) Protein N.

This enzyme has proved very efficient for the biosynthesis of acetohydroxamic acid (lithostat), and was used as a model to study the presence of a catalytic C-E-E-K tetrad instead of the long-stablished C-E-K triad in the nitrilase superfamily <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. We have obtained crystals of free and liganded forms of this enzyme. We already collected data at acidic pH values at XALOC beamline, ALBA (Barcelona, Spain) to a resolution of 1.73 Å. Crystal have been grown also at a wide range of conditions and pH (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). The corresponding structures will be used to get insights into enzymatic "ping-pong" mechanisms. Diferent polymorph were obtained at extreme pH values affecting also crystal quality and resolution limit, i.e. from 3.4 at pH 9.0 to 1.8 Å at pH 4.5.</p><p>Table 3 ID29 Formamidase Protein N. Crys.

Despite there are several deposited structures of homolog enzymes, including two structures with ligands, the structural basis of the enantioselectivity of this enzyme remains unknown. We have co-crystallizing this enzyme with different ligands to unravel the mechanisms behind its enantioselectivity with the aim of enhancing its substrate promiscuity. Apo protein and protein-ligand-A crystals were diffracted at ID23 to high resolution limit, 1.35 Å in both cases in the same space group C222 1 . Although initial autoprocessing suggested higher simetry space group (P422) it may be due to the tendency of this system to form twined crystals.</p><p>Future perpectives: We plan to grow co-crystals with other ligands to complete the picture that could allow us to stablished a possible mechanism for the observed enantioselectivity.</p><p>4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>v) Remadiation of radiation damage.</head><p>We have shortly started a collaborative project together with scientist at XALOC beamline (ALBA, Barcelona, Spain) to investigate different strategies to remediate the radiation damage during data collection at room temperature. In this project we have selected several model systems i.e. GST from E. Coli and several target systems i.e. Hyal, to study the effect of treatment, the use of scavangers, etc. Initial test to get space groups and resolution limits under cryo condition were carryied out at ID23 during this slot (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). Crystals of GST diffracted to a maxima resolution of 2.0 Å while Hyl crystal reached 1.5 Å. Data processing is on going and future experiments are been designed.</p><p>Table 5 ID23 GST Protein N.

From this subject we measure crystals from a PDZ domain, the third PDZ domain of the PSD95 (PDZ3-PSD95). This PDZ3 is anomalous among the PDZ domain because bear an additional α-helix at the carboxyl terminal. We have deleted this α-helix (PDZ3-PSD95-h) and characterized the resulting PDZ domain <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. These crystals take four years to grow.

These crystals diffract at 1.5 Å resolution and we were able to obtain a molecular replacement solution in the space group P21 (unit cell, 54.12 53.97 62.61 90 93.25 90) with four molecules at the AU. 6. Murciano-Calles, J., Martinez, J. C., Marin-Argany, M., Villegas, S. &amp; Cobos, E. S. (2014). Biophysical chemistry 185, 1-7.</p><p>ii) Proline rich sequences (PRMs) binding domains. We manage to obtain crystals of the first WW domain of the YAP65 in abcense and presence of several high affinity proline rich motifs. In October 2013, we collected data at 1.5 Å from very tiny crystals (&lt;20µm) of the apo form in the beamline XALOC of the ALBA synchrotron (Barcelona, Spain). The crystals diffraction was very good and we have written the manuscript that will be submitted soon. In this beamtime allocation, we tried to collect data of the complexes. Crystal does not diffract.</p><p>iii) HIV vaccines. We have obtained crystals of the covNHR antigen in two different crystallization conditions using ammonium sulphate and NaCl. These small protein constructs are derived from the gp41 HIV-1 protein and have been rationally engineered to display well known neutralizing epitopes of gp41, as well as being stable, soluble and easily producible by E. coli expression in recombinant form. Previously, we collected data at 2.5 Å from crystals grown in ammonium sulphate at the beamline XALOC of the ALBA synchrotron (Barcelona, Spain). We have a molecular replacement solution and at this beamtime allocation we wanted to improve the data's resolution. Unfortunately, in this beam time allocation we were only able to collect a single set of data from 20 different crystals and the resolution was not improved.</p><p>Additionally we brought samples of other proteins object of study in our group: iv) Ring1B. We have recently published the physico-chemical characterization of the N-terminal segment of this protein. We have obtained crystal of this protein. Up to the date, the only structure available of this protein is in complex with its partner protein Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1) which is critical components of the chromatin modulating PRC1 complex.</p><p>7.

We already collected data at the beamline XALOC of the ALBA synchrotron (Barcelona, Spain). Crystal diffract a medium resolution (2.5 Å) and showed fast decay. Up to the date, we were not able to obtain a MR. We have grown crystal in presence of metals to obtain the phases by MIR/SAD. At this beam time allocation we have collected several set of data, some at better resolution that the previous. Besides, we have obtained crystal in the presence of cadmium and we have collected several set of data to try to obtain the phase.
