<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the experiment</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate the global and local changes of the protein complex Photosystem II (PBD accession codes for this protein are 3BZ1 and 3BZ2 for the two monomers, 2AXT, 1S5L, 1W5C, 1ILX, 1FE1, 1IZL) extracted from Spinacia oleracea, which is responsible of the water oxidation during the photosynthetic process. This process occurs at a metallic cluster of 4 manganeses atoms and the calcium atom (CaMn 4 ). By light excitation of the harvesting complex (chlorophyll protein complex) and following chargeseparation and electron-transfer from the CaMn 4 cluster active site, changes in global and local conformation should be observed. The most important and noticeble changes should occur in the CaMn 4 cluster. This complex goes through 4 different oxidation states in order to oxidize water before recoil to the original redox state and the time for completing each step is different, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The original, dark, stable state is called S 1 state and each next transition-step is light-driven. Previous experimental results agree that the largest change in the CaMn 4 occurs between the S 2 and S 3 states. We focused on the time-resolved X-rays scattering measurements in time-scale relevant for this transition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The sample solution was infused in a quartz capillary and was continuously flowed in both directions during one single set of measurements. The light excitation was driven by the insitu nanosecond pulse green laser. The dedicated time was split into two halfs, one where we investigated the local change in the CaMn 4 cluster at large q-space measurements and one half where we focused on low q-ranges were the precence of large scale dynamics in the protein complex would appear. Two laser pulses were used to excite the Photosystem II complex: the first one induced the S 1 to S 2 transition. The S 2 state is long living so that the second laser flash after 300 μs induced the S 2 to S 3 transition. The S 3 state lives longer than S 2 state and its life time were extended by adding on electrons acceptor. We measured the new state at a time-delay of 3 ms after the second flash (ON). Several X-ray flashes were collected on the MarCCD before dumping the image. Because of the long lasting S 3 state, the X-ray pulse train was extended to 5 μs long. The single differential diffraction pattern dS 3 ms was then computed as usual <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The average of such dS 3 ms is sketched in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The main humps between 1.5-4.0 Å -1 are due to the solvent heating. Similar experiments were carried out to catch the S 1 to S 2 transition. In this case, only one laser flash excited the solution and we measured the laser-excited solution after 4 ms (dS 4 ms ). The average of several single differential scattering is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. Also here the main humps are due to the solvent heating. The second half of the time was dedicated to the global change in the Photosystem II complex after charge-separation, i.e. we focused on small angle X-rays scattering (TR-SAXS). We could measure 2 different samples: a similar to the WAXS measurements, plus a so-called PhotosystemII core, a more purified preparation. In this specific case only one time-delay measurements were carried out at a time delay of 4 ms, trying to catch the global change after charge separation. The results are similar to Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and 3, when watching a q &lt; 2.5 Å -1 . By comparing the two protein complexes (membranes and core complexes) we can also filter out the signal coming from changes in the membranes or catch the global changes in the membranes of the Photosystem II complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical problems encountered.</head><p>The synchronization of the two laser flashes and the X-ray probe pulse was initially a problem since the available software was not developed for such a set-up. The software code had to be altered by the beam line scientists but eventually the timing worked correctly. Also, there were some initial problems with the CCD that had to be solved by the technicians.</p><p>During the collection of the data, suddenly, the automatic conversion from CCDraw files to EDF files stopped due to an expectable crash of the main computer which induced the crash in the subsystems. From this point all the CCDraw to EDF files conversions were run manually. In order to establish the heating component, the solution was heated by a small infrared diode and the usual OFF-ON experiment was carried out. Unfortunately, these experiments were not working properly due to a combination of problems related to the flow rate in the capillary, focus spot of the laser and the delivery of pulses from the software. This problem will be circumvented in the future by using a new IR laser for water heating with a small beam diameter. Another obstacle was discovered after the beam-time had ended. It was found that the pinhole used at the beam-line and used to align the laser and the X-ray beams, as well as to determine the focus of the laser, was damaged. The size of the pin-hole was much larger (400 um) then expected (50 um) which means that the overlap between the X-ray and laser probably was very pore. It is also a delicate experimental balance between the flow rate of sample through the capillary and the delivery of the two laser pulses so that new sample is hit in every experimental cycle. If the focal spot of the laser is large and the overlap is slightly wrong it is likely that the sample is exposed to more than two flashes each time bringing the photo cycle back to ground state again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Thus, in conclusion, the problems with the heating measurements and the pin-hole unfortunately make it very difficult to extract any useful and trustful data from this experiment.
