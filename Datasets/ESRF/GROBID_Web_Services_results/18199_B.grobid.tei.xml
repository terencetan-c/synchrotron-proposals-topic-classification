<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Diesel or lean-burn engines operates with oxygen-rich air/fuel mixtures in order to reach maximum fuel efficiency. In this condition, the actual technology for abatement of dangerous pollutants emitted by motor engines, particularly NOx (nitrogen oxides), does not work correctly. The alumina-supported silver system is one of the most promising catalysts tested up to date. This material shows a catalytic activity strongly dependent on silver loading, displaying maximum activity for intermediate loading (between 2-3 wt. %), a fact that has been grounded on the existence of metallic silver for higher loadings at reaction conditions which, in turn, favors the burning of hydrocarbons with oxygen and not with NOx. In this study a careful preparation method of the Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was used in order to maximize the quantity of silver active species and then facilitate the analysis of its electronic/geometric characteristics and behavior under reaction conditions. XAFS experiments were carried out at the Ag K-edge using the set-up of beam line BM29 with a Si(111) monochromator, a home-made treatment cell to perform experiments under controlled temperature and atmosphere and calibrating the energy scale by measuring simultaneously a Ag foil (XANES study). Two catalysts, displaying very high activity in the selective reduction of NO x with hydrocarbons and containing, respectively, 1.5 and 4.5 wt. % of Ag, were analyzed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> shows the XANES spectra of these samples in their calcined, initial state and some reference material having linear (Ag 2 O, α-AgAlO 2 ) or tetrahedral (β-AgAlO 2 ) local geometry for the first silver coordination shell. Although some differences are encountered in the region of ca. 25525 eV, a remarkable similarity can be observed between both Ag/Al 2 O 3 specimens and the β-AgAlO 2 XANES reference spectrum; this clearly indicates that silver active species have a strong contact with the support, stabilizing in this way dispersed entities having silver cations in tetrahedral local geometry. EXAFS was used (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) to proof that these tetrahedral silver clusters are stable under reaction conditions, being practically unaltered when subjected to a gas mixture simulating the exhaust gas up to temperatures of 823 K.</p><p>Differences between the catalytic activity of the two catalysts analyzed should be then grounded on relative variations of the interaction of reactants with the active phase and not on silver phase nature or distribution. In our case, the 4.5 Ag system displays a lower light-off temperature for NO conversion.</p><p>Mechanistic studies and thermo-programmed reaction runs (followed by XANES -result not shown) in presence of the hydrocarbon suggest that the ease with which the reductant extracts oxygen from the silvercontaining active phase and produce a partially oxidized organic compound can be the key parameter to optimize the catalytic behavior of the system.</p><p>Assistance of BM29 staff during this experiment is gratefully acknowledged.
