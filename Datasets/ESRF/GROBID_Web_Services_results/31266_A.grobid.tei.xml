<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>27GPa, is not orthorhombic as previously claimed, but monoclinic with an incommensurate structure containing surprisingly large modulations of the atomic positions <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. This structure type was previously unknown in the elements, and Te-III, Se-IV and S-III (in which we have found the same incommensurate structure) are three of only five known simply modulated elemental structures. The known phase diagram of tellurium shows Te-III existing up to the melting curve, and the incommensurate nature of the structure will then have important implications for studies of liquid-Te (l-Te), where the structures of the crystalline phases have been essential in interpreting diffraction data from the liquid phases. The very different structure for Te-III thus opens the way to a reinterpretation of the structures of l-Te at high pressure, in particular those involved in the liquid-liquid phase transition reported at 4-5GPa.</p><p>In this proposal we asked for 3 days of beam time on ID09 to follow the structure of Te-III at high temperatures, (i) to determine the T-dependence of the incommensurate wavevector and atomic modulations, and (ii) to monitor the changes in structure, coordination and density that accompany the onset of melting of Te-III at ~800K. Powder diffraction data were collected from 3 different samples over a wide range pf P and T up to 21GPa and 743 K, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We found the incommensurate Te-III phase to be stable up to at least 743K, and determined the P-T dependence of the incommensurate wave vector q, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. q is clearly strongly dependent on both P and T. As reported previously, q initially decreases on compression at room temperature before reaching a minimum and then increasing again. Similar behaviour is observed on compression at higher temperatures. q is also strongly temperature dependent, and decreases with increasing temperature, with the change being largest at lower pressures.</p><p>In addition to determining the P-T dependence of the incommensurate Te-III, we found that the rhombohedral Î²-Po phase of Te, Te-IV, previously reported to exist at room temperature, is stable only above 315 K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The revised phase diagram for Te to 35GPa and 900K, including the newly-observed Te-IV phase, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Attempts to study liquid-Te were, unfortunately, unsuccessful. Although we were able to reach the P-T conditions of the liquid state (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), this phase reacted very rapidly with the metallic gaskets used in the pressure cells making data analysis impossible.
