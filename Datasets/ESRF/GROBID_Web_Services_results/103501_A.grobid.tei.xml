To this end we wanted to study the pressure-temperature-thickness phase diagram using single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). On the more general site, this experiment was also intended to demonstrate that the upgraded ESRF machine in combination with the new ID27 beamline is indeed capable to measure XRD data from nanoflakes with lateral dimensions in the range of 10Âµm and thicknesses well below 50nm making it a unique tool to explore how the complex electronic pressure-temperature phase diagrams in the wide class of layered vdW materials evolves when the thickness of these materials is reduced towards the 2D limit.</p><p>We were indeed able to not only measure the Bragg peaks in flakes with thicknesses below 20nm, but also the superlattice reflections stemming from the subtle lattice distortions due to the electronic order in these materials.</p><p>To our knowledge this was the first time such a challenging experiment has been conducted, hence this result alone is a significant success, as it shows that such experiments have become possible with the ESRF upgrade. However, we were also facing a number of solvable technical problems (explained in more detail below) which, in the end prevented the intended quantitative mapping of the pressure-temperature-thickness phase diagram. Thus, the scientific case is yet to be resolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Details of the actual Experiment</head><p>To prepare the samples, we used the scotch tape method to peel off thin flakes from a high-quality bulk single crystal onto a silicon substrate. The thickness of a few flakes has been measured with an atomic fource microscope in order to correlate the optical contrast on the silicone substrate to the thickness of the flakes. Based on this optical appearance we than chose flakes with different thicknesses and used a dry transfer technique employing a Polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer stamp to pick up the flakes and position them on a diamond of a diamond anvil cell (DAC) to compare their structural evolution as a function of temperature and pressure. In addition to the proposed material 1T-IrTe2 we also prepared flakes from the related material 1T-TaS2.</p><p>In order to facilitate the alignment of the DAC we put a gold particle next to the flakes. A ruby which we wanted to use as a pressure gauge was also placed on the diamond anvil. An image of the flakes covered with PCL with the ruby and gold particle next to it is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Initially we planned to measure the ambient-pressure data on flakes prepared on a TEM silicone nitride membrane (cf. proposal) to minimize the background signal as much as possible. However, this step would have required to use a different cryostat and since we only had four days of beamtime we decided to start with the DAC cryostat right away in order to avoid the time loss due to a change of setup. Thus, we started the experiment with 1T-TaS2, as the flakes from this material have generally larger lateral dimensions. We used the KB2 optics at 30 keV photon energy and a beam focus of about 500nm diameter.</p><p>Using the microscope camera of the ruby fluorescence spectrometer we were able to locate the flakes on the diamond anvil. We then aligned the gold particle to the center of rotation. Assuming that the surface of the diamond anvil is nearly perpendicular to the beam (at hdth=0) we then used the microscope camera of the ruby fluorescence spectrometer to bring the nano flakes into the beam. Using this procedure, we centered 18 different 1T-TaS2 flakes with varying thickness. For each of these flakes we collected one low-and one high flux single crystal datasets of 124 images taken from hdth=-31 deg to hdth=31 deg in steps of 0.5 deg. In these data it was possible to identify the superlattice reflections even for the thinnest flakes which had a thickness below 20nm. However, the background from the diamond and some residual PCL on top of the flakes makes a quantitative interpretation of this data very difficult and we are still working on the analysis. We then loaded the DAC with helium as pressure transmitting medium. Due to a technical problem during the loading process the starting pressure was already about 3GPa and it turned out that the residual PCL along with the nano flakes had detached from the diamond surface. This has prevented us from finding the samples again and we lost about 2 shifts.</p><p>We then decided to switch to the IrTe2 samples. Since there was also some residual PCL on top of the flakes and because it would have taken about 12 hours to fully resolve the polymer in tetrahydofuran we decided to not close and load the DAC, but put it into the crysostat in order to measure the temperature dependency for different flake thicknesses at ambient pressure. For IrTe2 the flakes have generally smaller lateral dimensions. However, using the same alignment procedure as for 1T-TaS2 we were again able to measure XRD data for these samples. We then started a temperature dependence from RT down to 10K in steps of 40K. At 190K we could see the onset of electronic order in one flake and at 150K also in the other flake (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The observed superstructure is qualitatively similar to the superstructure found in bulk samples but occurs at lower temperatures consistent with reported transport data. Unfortunately, at 110K and below a technical problem with the cryostat heater led to a drifting temperature of the shield and accordingly a misalignment of the sample position such that the data for these temperatures are not useable. We are also here facing the same challenges due to the large background from the diamond and the PCL and we are still working on the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, the experiment surely demonstrated the feasibility to measure single crystal XRD on exfoliated nano-flakes in a DAC at ID27. Since this was the very first attempt, we think it is natural to face some technical issues. In particular the problem with the residual PCL can be easily solved with tetrahydofuran. In order to reduce the background, we can use cells with thinner diamonds which were developed for x-ray spectroscopy.</p><p>For the vdW nano-flake materials the low-pressure region up to about 5GPa is most interesting which means that the reduced pressure range of these specialized cells does not cause a problem. The ultimate goal will be to improve the data quality up to a level which allows for full crystallographic refinements of the crystal structure. We want to emphasize that the development of this experimental method is very useful and important as it can not only be applied to the huge material class of layered vdW systems but also other thin film systems and even bulk systems with very light elements where the diamond background can be a problem, too. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Microscope image of 1T-TaS2 flakes covered with a thin layer of PCL polymer.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,416.24,614.98,154.50,128.62" type="bitmap" /></figure>
