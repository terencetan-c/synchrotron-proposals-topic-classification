<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Transition metal clusters of sub-nanometre size exhibit unique optical(and catalytic)properties depending on their precise number of atoms, structure and confinement. The main goal of this proposal is to reach a unified description of well-defined confined Cu, Pb and Pt metal clusters with precise numbers of atoms based on fluorescence microscopy, TEM, XAS and NMR.</p><p>With their well-defined pore structure, zeolites are highly versatile host materials to confine and stabilize molecular metal clusters with different sizes and structures. Cu nanodots exhibit blue fluorescence, and confined element Cu clusters could represent a promising alternative to supported noble metal clusters for many application as phosphor for lighting, as chemical sensors or in catalysis. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy could assist here by providing local chemical information of the clusters of interest. 63  Cu is an NMR-active nuclei with spin Â½ or 3/2 and a natural abundance high enough to allow NMR studies without isotopic enrichment and at frequencies within the range of commercial broadband probes. The spectroscopic signature of transition metal atoms in a cluster depends on their location within the cluster. All these signatures are summed upon detection, making it extremely challenging to disentangle the different chemical environments. In combination with XAS, a new generation of NMR/TEM characterization tools is being developed for this type of clusters which could truly capitalize on the vastly superior spectral detail intrinsically present in NMR. This will help to understand the relation between the structure of the clusters and their luminescent behavior. Starting from NH4 + exchanged zeolites, Cu cations were exchanged onto specific sites of the zeolite framework. Ionexchanged samples were then thermally activated to induce reduction and cluster formation. After the synthesis of the loaded zeolites, an initial characterisation with UV-VIS absorption ans ESR was made. TEM was performed to visualize the clusters in the pores of the materials. In view of the limited number of shifts allocated (9 shifts) XANES spectra were recorded on all samples to assist in revealing local structure, oxidation and electronic state. Only on selected samples EXAFS spectra were recorded. Cu K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra were recorded at 110k to prevent beam induced changes to the oxidation state (especially in the case of Cu), and at between 230 an 298K to allow correlation with the temperature dependent NMR results. All samples characterised with EXAFS have been heavily characterised with multinuclear NMR: 1 H, 27 Al , 29 Si and 63 Cu. Combination of these datasets, with Rietveld refinement on the HR-PXRD data will yield a reference dataset that can be used for structure analysis of fully unknown samples. At present all these datasets are being combined in a molecular scale model which will serve to perform theoretical modelling of structure and properties of the clusters. Once finished these models will need more experimental verification. This work is ongoing.</p></div>
