<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aim of the experiment was to take advantage of the high coherent flux of the ID10 beamline after the newest upgrade and to make use of large area photon counting detectors such as the EIGER 4M, to probe the wave vector dependence of the dynamics of metallic glass formers in the liquid as well as the glassy state on a large range of wavevectors (SAXS (0.03-0.5 Å -1 ) and WAXS (0.5 -3 Å -1 ). Due to the small signal, especially at smaller angles, an excellent signal, now available with the upgrade at ESRF, is much needed.</p><p>For the experiments the compositions Pt/Pd42.5Cu27Ni9.5P21 should be used, due to their high stability against crystallization and a comprising amount of data from previous synchrotron and nonsynchrotron experiments that the group can rely on.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 crisis and the limitations that arose from it the experimental group was limited to just one on-site user. Also this experiment was the first of its kind in WAXS geometry that was performed at ID10 after the upgrade. Therefore the beamtime was basically used to commissionWAXS XPCS and a large number of problems occurred during the beamtime.</p><p>First of all the EIGER 4M, which was an important part of the experiment was not yet available onsite. Therefore we had to switch too the Maxipix 2x2 detector with a much worse performance and it also prevented the work at small angles. Therefore we could only perform some test measurements at wide angles and we had to skip the main goal of the experiment (i.e. the investigation of the dynamics at small Qs). The Maxipix 2x2 does not only possess a smaller area but also a smaller resolution (512 x 512 vs. 2070 x 2167) combined with a smaller contrast. Another huge problem was a large number of spurious oscillations at small as well as large times (compare Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>) that arised from the oven setup (long times) as well as the monochromator cooling system (at short times).</p><p>Moreover, did the bad condition of the monochromator (it is now changed to the best of our knowledge) limit the contrast of the experiment (roughly 1.5 %) even further. Figure 2 Corresponding temperatur profile of the 'nanodac' controller used for the furnace during the measurement shown in Fig.1. The period ( ~80 s) of the temperature signal matches well with the oscillations on the long time-scale of the intensity autocorrelation function.</p><p>In summary the setup in its condition during the time of the operation did not allow to successfully carry out the experiment. Even after a high amount of work in processing of the data after the experiment, the exctration of meaningful and reliable data was not possible. Therefore we have to summarize that the experiment was not successful and we hope to be able to carry out this experiment at a later point.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
