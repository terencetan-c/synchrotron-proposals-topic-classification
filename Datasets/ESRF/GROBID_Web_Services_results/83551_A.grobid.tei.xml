<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>6 Time-resolved studies of supramolecular assemblies of farnesylated hGBP1 in vitro 6.1 Introduction Human Guanylate Binding Protein 1 (hGBP1) is a GTPase belonging to the family of dynamin-related proteins. Other members of this family like dynamin or bacterial dynamin-like protein (BDLP) are involved in membrane fission and fusion events for example <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . A prerequisite for this functionality is the polymerization and membrane binding ability of those proteins. For BDLP it was shown that the inactive compact conformation is able to structurally rearrange and largely open a trunk region leading to a very elongated conformation that is polymerization competent 2 . Interestingly, these general fold properties like the globular GTP binding domain and the extended helical domain is conserved amongst eukaryotic dynamins even though their high sequence divergence. For hGBP1, this elongated structure was also observed in the crystal structure 3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-1) with the globular N-terminal domain (large GTPase/LG domain), a middle domain (MD) and the extended ! helix 12, spanning the whole protein backbone of about 130 Å back to the LG domain, and C-terminal hydrophobic ! helix 13, where the farnesylation site is located. In previous experiments, hGBP1 was mainly studied in the non-farnesylated state, like the crystal structures available for the monomeric full-length protein <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref> or for the monomeric and dimeric LG domain constructs 5 . But also functional and structural studies focused on unmodified hGBP1, drawing a picture of a hydrolysis cycle for GTP hydrolysis involving different oligomeric states of the protein, from monomeric in the inactive state to dimeric or even tetrameric in the nucleotide-bound and hydrolysis transition state respectively <ref type="bibr">6 -8</ref> . In our recent paper, we have moreover shown that the unmodified protein is able to largely rearrange upon nucleotide binding and comprises a high structural flexibility. This suggested rearrangement could lead to an additional interaction side as the C-terminal attached farnesyl is exposed and accessible for other extended molecules.</p><p>The first studies focusing on farn-hGBP1 in vivo have shown that it is mainly cytosolic but rearranges upon GDP AlFx addition for example to large vesicle-like structures as they were also observed for mGBPs (Figure 6-2). In a recent study using EM and vesicle binding assays, the authors have shown that farn-hGBP1 is able to form large supramolecular clusters 9 in contrast to the unmodified hGBP1 which forms dimers and eventually tetramers 8 . The protein assembly to 'supramolecular' complexes consisting of several thousand molecules has been shown to be essential to directly attack T. gondii for murine GBPs 10 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-2).</p><p>In this study, we focused further on the polymerization behavior of farn-hGBP1.</p><p>Using time-resolved SAXS measurements, we were able to follow the kinetics of assembly non-invasively in solution. With descriptive models, we have fitted the time course of assembly and built a kinetic model. </p></div>

After centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 60 min at 4°C, the supernatant was subjected to His6-tag affinity chromatography (HisPur Cobalt</p><p>Resin, Thermo Scientific, or TALON superflow, GE Healthcare). hGBP1 containing fractions were combined and ammonium sulphate was added to a final concentration of 3 M. After 10 min of stirring at room temperature, the precipitate was separated by centrifugation at 7,140 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was either stored at -80°C or directly resuspended in buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl) and applied onto a Superdex 200 26/60 column. All fractions containing monomeric hGBP1 were combined, concentrated to a final concentration of about 100 mg/ml and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80°C. The protein purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4-20% gradient gel, Expedeon).</p><p>Purification of farn-hGBP1. The purification strategy was the same as described for hGBP1, with an additional hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC, HiTrap</p><p>Butyl HP, GE Healthcare) step for separation of unmodified from farnesylated hGBP1 after His6-tag affinity chromatography. The HIC column was equilibrated with buffer containing high salt concentration (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2 and 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4) and eluted with low salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2).</p><p>After His6-tag affinity as well as after HIC chromatography, the protein containing fractions were precipitated using 3 M (NH4)2SO4 as described for the unmodified hGBP1 before.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.1">Turbidity Assays</head><p>The earlier described polymerization of farn-hGBP1 in presence of nucleotides can be observed using turbidity assays. The transmittivity of the sample solution is followed at a wavelength of 350 nm in a regime, where neither protein or nucleotide are absorbing.</p><p>The addition of 1 mM GTP leads after an initial lag time to a fast increase of turbidity.</p><p>For this hydrolysable nucleotide, the turbidity disappears at later timepoints and the signal vanishes back to the initial background signal. In the other case of GDP AlFx, which is a nucleotide trapping the protein nucleotide complex in the hydrolysis transition state, the turbidity onset is also delayed, defined as a lag time in the beginning. The observed turbidity change is irreversible over the whole detected time range. Even after several hours to days, the signal does not change except for sedimentation taking place after a while. Under both nucleotide conditions, the kinetics followed by turbidity change are protein concentration dependent. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.2">DLS</head><p>Following dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments confirmed the appearance of higher oligomers and supramolecular structures. Directly after addition of 1 mM GTP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-6), the hydrodynamic radius determined from the measured translational diffusion coefficient corresponds to about 3-9 nm representing a compact conformation of farn-hGBP1 before activation, as the crystal-like structure would yield a hydrodynamic radius of about 4 nm (calculated from pdb ID 1DG3 using hydropro) or 5.7 nm for a theoretical dimer as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-1 (calculated from the dimer model using hydropro). After several minutes upon addition of GTP, a second species appeared with hydrodynamic radii of 200 -600 nm. The apparent radius is first increasing and after a maximum of about 600 nm after around 40 min decreasing again to around 3-4 nm, probably indicating the complete reversion back to the monomeric protein after GTP hydrolysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">6-6</ref>). After addition of GDP AlFx, additional oligomers next to the monomeric farn-hGBP1 appear with hydrodynamic radii around 20 nm and another species around 300-700 nm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref>). In contrast to polymerization in presence of GTP, the additional species are observed with rather constant size and up to several hours. This would also confirm the observation of the turbidity assays, where the kinetics appear to be reversible in the case of GTP and irreversible for GDP AlFx.</p><p>The limits of DLS measurements are important to keep in mind as they are selfcorrelated data traces over a certain time interval, about 1 min intervals for most of the performed measurements, the polymerization probably takes place during the measured interval and perturbs the accuracy of size determination. Moreover, in the size regime of several hundreds of nanometers, light scattering is angle dependent (Mie scattering) and the usually applied approximations for automated DLS data analysis do not hold anymore. Therefore, exact size estimations are not possible for these experiments, but they are still valuable information on the overall polymerization behavior of farn-hGBP1 induced by GTP or GDP AlFx respectively.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-7: Turbidity change of farn-hGBP1 after GDP AlFx addition monitored at 350 nm in the upper panels. (A) Turbidity assay of 15 %M farn-hGBP1 after addition of 1 mM GDP AlFx (red). (B) DLS size distribution of 14 %M farn-hGBP1 with 1 mM GDP AlFx weighted based on intensities of the species, respectively shown at different timepoints as indicated in the legend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.3">Cryo TEM</head><p>The observed polymerization was also studied using cryo electron microscopy for more reliable size information compared to DLS for the reasons explained before. The samples were plunge frozen at different time points after nucleotide addition, thereby allowing to follow the structural changes during polymerization.

At the first timepoint (29 s), the water filled hole in the grid seems to contain only a layer of vitrified water with a constant background density, implying that the protein and nucleotides contained in the sample are randomly distributed. After 122 seconds, first shadowed regions can be observed. The regions span from the carbon grid across the water filled hole and seem to be interconnected. The network expands further as observed at later timepoints like 319, 466 and 899 seconds, covering almost the whole grid surface at later timepoints. Interestingly, the structures observed at higher magnifications are mainly disc-like particles with varying contrasts at different radial positions. The disc-like structures are mainly observed perpendicular to the beam direction or slightly twisted, allowing to calculate a density profile. The discs also attach to each other in some observations, mediated by the outer leaflet. Stacked discs as proposed by Shydlovskyi et al. 9 are very rarely observed and not representative for the observations made in this experiment. By picking the disc-like structures observed at the two magnifications and radially averaging their density profiles, one dimensional length profiles are created (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref><ref type="figure">7</ref><ref type="figure">8</ref><ref type="figure">9</ref>).</p><p>The obtained contrast profile could be used for distance refinement of the disc layers that are used for fitting the SAXS data, as described earlier. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.4">SAXS</head><p>To gain insights into the inner structure of the observed discs, SAXS and USAXS was performed. The scattering pattern over time was recorded after addition of the nucleotides as described before at various detector distances varying thereby the observed q range and in consequence the observable length scale of the structures.</p><p>After addition of 1 mM GTP, changes in the scattering pattern can be observed at all detector distances (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref> A peak in the scattering pattern is appearing after approximately 185 s at around 0.25 nm -1 , but also an upturn in forward scattering direction can be observed (&lt; 0.1 nm -1 ).</p><p>At the next measured detector distance of 10 m, covering a q range of 0.01 to around 0.8 nm -1 , similar effects are observed. A peak around 0.25 nm -1 arises after around 180 s and the upturn in forward scattering direction evolves to a steeper slope. A new observation is the appearance of a second plateau at small angles that can be observed in the beginning (around 0.01 -0.02 nm -1 , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-10). This could be due to species of higher molecular weight that are already built after 141 s, but as the smaller detector distance shows a full turn-over of farn-hGBP1 monomers that are present in the beginning back to monomers after GTP hydrolysis, it is more likely that the background subtraction is not precise enough at higher detector distances and due to the very low scattering intensity of the small biomolecules. This upturn is therefore regarded as experimental artefact and not further discussed anymore. The return of the scattering pattern to the initial condition confirms the earlier observed reversible kinetics from turbidity and DLS experiments in presence of GTP. In the case of kinetics observed after GDP AlFx addition, the scattering intensity changes during the time course but stays constant after a certain time (Figure 6-11).</p><p>This observation matches well with the non-reversible polymerization kinetics as described before for turbidity and DLS measurements. Scattering at high q values stays constant after approximately 4 minutes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-11 A and C), implying that the inner structure is readily formed in a first phase. After this first phase, changes in the scattering pattern are observed in the low q range at larger detector distances (Figure  6-11 B and D). This points to the assumption that only structural reassembly on a macromolecular level takes place and that the inner structure of the assembled polymer is similar to the soluble precursors. After more than 10 minutes, the scattering pattern does not observably change even at lowest q values. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.5">Fluorescence imaging</head><p>Using fluorescence imaging, the earlier observed unspecific aggregation in electron microscopy images can be confirmed. With GDP AlFx, the network appears to be evenly distributed throughout the observation window (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-12 A). In presence of GTP, a network comprising differently sized wholes can be observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-12 B). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.6">Comparison of kinetics from different methods</head><p>The time-dependent parameters obtained from SAXS data fitting are compared to the earlier obtained macroscopic observations from turbidity assays as well as from cryo TEM obtained information about the discs in solution.</p><p>For farn-hGBP1 in presence of GTP, measurements at 6 %M protein concentration are very low in scattering intensity and the signal can therefore not be extracted easily.</p><p>For turbidity assays on the other hand, concentrations as needed for SAXS were challenging due to the fast onset of the kinetics and the high turbidity signal, leading to early detector saturation. Therefore, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-13, the kinetic profile of 6 %M farn-hGBP1 with GTP in a turbidity assay is compared to the amplitudes obtained for monomer scattering and disc scattering from SAXS experiments at 63 %M farn-hGBP1 with GTP. The monomer signal follows a similar trend at both measured detector distances and therefore size ranges, showing a short lag time during the first 120 seconds, leading to a fast decay of the signal and a slow recovery that is not fully resolved in the time course of measurements (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-13 C). The signal of the discs on the other hand, is better described at higher detector distances, meaning on larger length scales (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-13 D). Comparable to the onset of monomer decay, an upturn of the disc scattering intensities is observed. The polymer scattering contribution was only fitted for detector distances higher than 1.50 m, as the relevant scattering regime is not recorded at the higher q values. The polymer scattering follows the kinetics similar as the observed turbidity change, implying that the turbidity is mainly due to polymer scattering contributions. The polymerization of farn-hGBP1 in presence of GDP AlFx is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-14.</p><p>At the lowest SAXS detector distances, the decay of monomer signal coincides very well with the upturn of disc-like particles. Moreover, at 10 m, the formation of polymers is observed on a similar time scale as for the disc-like particles. At the highest detector distance, only a snapshot at a late polymerization state was taken which can only be used to confirm the presence of polymers seen at lowest q values. Even though the q range down to 0.004 nm -1 was measured, a plateau region was not reached, thereby preventing the structural characterization or determination of overall parameters like radius of gyration for these polymers is prevented.</p><p>Interestingly, the kinetics observed in the SAXS experiments are faster compared to the bulk measurement by turbidity, as even the onset of polymerization is taking place during the lag phase of turbidity and a plateau of polymers is reached earlier as in turbidity assays. The same was observed in the presence of GTP, as the turbidity assays of 6 %M farn-hGBP1 show similar time constants compared to 63 %M farn-hGBP1 SAXS measurements. This effect could be due bad mixing the turbidity cuvettes, as the small nucleotide volume was carefully added to the cuvette avoiding bubbles or shaking.</p><p>Therefore, diffusion effects might be responsible for the late onset of polymerization in UV/Vis experiments. the SAXS derived half times are systematically higher than expected in the case of GTP addition, which was already observed and discussed earlier. From the slope and curvature of the double-logarithmic half-times plot, additional hints into the aggregation mechanism are expected <ref type="bibr">16</ref> . The scaling exponents of 1.28 +/-0.19 for GTP-induced polymerization and 0.66 +/-0.12 for GDP AlFx-induced polymerization are significantly different, thereby implying different underlying aggregation mechanisms. On the other hand, the observed polymer structures from imaging experiments do not suggest a very coordinated and organized higher order structure. This observation of unorganized polymer networks is further underlined by the power law exponent of about 3 to 3.5 that is obtained from SAXS data fits for the polymer scattering behavior. As described by Hammouda 17 and shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-17, the power law exponent of around 3 to 3.5 is characteristic for a clustered network, whereas linear cylinder stacks would yield an expected power law exponent of 1 and are therefore very unlikely to be present under our observed conditions. The comparison of the obtained fit results of the disc's inner structure with the EM results shows that both methods yield similar over all dimensions of the disc with a maximal radius of about 30 nm in both cases. The electron density profile from SAXS measurements was determined using scattering data from 1.50 m detector distance of the measurement with highest farn-hGBP1 concentration in presence of GDP AlFx (35 %M farn-hGBP1), leaving the radii of the shells and their corresponding electron densities as free-floating parameters. For all following fits, those evaluated electron density profiles were fixed and only the height and the amplitude of scattering were left as free parameters, to minimize the degrees of freedom during the fit routines. As seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-10 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>-11, this approach leads to satisfying fit results even at higher q ranges for other protein concentrations as well, indicating that the shape of the built disc-like structures is protein-concentration independent. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Discussion</head><p>This combination of real space information with time resolved scattering data shows the complementarity of cryo TEM with SAXS leading to cross-validated and refined structural models. We have shown that the oligomerization behavior of farn-hGBP1 is fundamentally different from the unmodified protein that was studied earlier and described in chapter 3 and 5 of this thesis. In contrast to the earlier hypothesized hydrolysis mechanism of hGBP1 cycling between inactive monomers to dimers and eventually tetramers, farn-hGBP1 assembles to large supramolecular clusters upon trapping of the hydrolysis intermediate state using GDP AlFx. From cryo TEM and fluorescence imaging, these clusters seem to be randomly oriented and interconnected, not linearly stacked as proposed earlier 9 .</p><p>An important additional information would be the formation of the discs during the first 80 seconds that could not be determined from our experiments so far. It would help to understand if the mechanism is related to the observed dynamics as described for the unmodified protein and therefore also including additional precursors like dimers and tetramers. Moreover, precisely timed kinetic measurements especially after addition of GTP are needed, as the experiments performed in this thesis are all based on manual mixing and timing and therefore, a high experimental error of the time measurements is likely. This is problematic mainly for GTP-induced assembly of farn-hGBP1, as the kinetics are several orders of magnitude fast than after addition of GDP AlFx. An automated mixing setup like mixing chambers or stopped-flow instruments would be beneficial to improve the time resolution and should be performed in a next step.</p></div>
