<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>screened on the TALOS Artica at the CNB Madrid were loaded into the microscope by Eaazhisai. The first grid was determiend to be of sufficient quality for data collection, and the first few hours of the experiment were dedicated to screening grid squares for optimal ice thickness and optimisation of acquisition parameters. Specifically, the dose per frame (0.96e -/Å 2 -1.5e -/Å 2 ) and total exposure time (5-9s) were varied to determine whether this could improve contrast close to focus; a problem that we commonly encounter in nsP1 data collections due to the presence of detergent in the sample buffer and compounded by the continuous carbon film over the grid. Contrast in the images was good until around 0.8µm.</p><p>The following acquisition parameters were selected for the final experiment: nominal magnification: 165, 000x (corresponding to a pixel size of 0.827Å/pix), spot size: 6, defocus range: 1-2.5µm, dose rate: 5.27e - /pix/s, exposure time: 5s distributed over 40 frames, total dose per movie: 38.5e -/Å 2 . The energy filter was set at a slit width of 20eV. Using FEI EPU automated software, 5626 movies were recorded in couting mode from 11 grid squares that had been selected at the screening stage, where seven images were aquired per hole. Drift correction was set once per grid square, and autofocussing performed every third grid hole. The movies were processed on the fly using the CM01 pipeline; monitored via the ExiMX interface. Movie drift was first corrected using MotionCorr2 and CTF correction performed with gCTF. The images exhibited minimal drift (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) over the dataset, and high overall resolution. Both factors were significantly improved compared with a previous collection from the same grid on a TALOS. Data were transferred to the lab, and the movies were processed from within Relion 3.0. Following motion correction (Motion Corr2) and CTF correction (CTFFind 4), 478 of the 5626 movies were discarded due to drift, ice contamination, poor contrast or highly astigmatic CTFs. Around 1000 particles in a selection of orientations were selected from 100 micrographs for 2D classification, yielding templates for Relion's autopicking procedure. From an intitial 263,415 particles selected from the dose-weighted micrographs (roughly 30-50 per micrograph), 180,921 were retained following pruning and 2D classification. 2D classification yielded classes clearly corresponding to single dodocameric rings of nsP1 (Figure 2), and double dodocameric rings (24mers, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) where the two rings were separated by a micelle belt. The presence of the double and single ring species of nsP1 has previously been documented in negative stain and cryo-EM imaging. Both single and double rings exhibited a range of particle orientations corresponding well with projections from our final models, although top views were singificantly more poulated for single rings and lateral views for double rings. Despite preferential orientations, there was sufficient sampling of the symmetry space to obtain reconstructions to high resolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Whilst lateral views in 2D classes could easily be separated for double or single rings, top views could not easily be ascribed to either species by eye. 3D classification was used to separate single rings from doubles, using a low-pass filtered single ring ab initio model that had been obtained from a previous dataset recorded from the same grid on a TALOS. Classifications with different numbers of classes consistently yielded two major classes corresponding to the single rings (105,825 particles) and double rings (47,338 particles), with smaller classes of "junk" partciles. A further round of 3D classification performed with the single rings improved particle homogeneity (94,018 particles). Ab initio model generation and 3D classification were all performed without imposing symmetry. Reconstructions were performed with the single and double ring classes in Relion 3Dautorefine, with the models and particles obtained from 3D classification. Reconstructions were initially performed in C1 to ascertain whether there were conformational differences between nsP1 protomers. Resolution reached 4.3Å (4.0Å post map sharpening) for the single rings and 7.1Å (6.8Å following map sharpening) for the double rings. As no significant difference was observed between protomers in the maps, single ring reconstructions were performed imposing C12 symmetry to a resolution of 3.7Å without masking, and 3.0Å with masking, as estimated using the gold FSC criterion at a threshold of 0.143. Resolution improved to 3.4Å and 2.9Å following map sharpening, and further to 2.6Å following a single round of particle polishing and per-particle CTF correction. For the double rings, reconstructions with D12 symmetry reached a resolution of 3.87Å without masking, and 3.1Å with masking. A single round of particle polishing and per-particle CTF correction finally improved the resolution to 2.9Å. Subsequent rounds of per-particle CTF correction and polishing did not improve resolution for either reconstruction. Both of these resolutions are significantly higher than those obtained with the TALOS dataset using the same workflow but with roughly one third of the number of particles (3.3Å for single rings-24,554 particles, 3.8Å for double rings-16,366 particles).</p><p>The high resolution and overall excellent quality of the maps allowed for ab initio modelling of the nsP1 protein sequence using Coot; an important advance as bioinformatic modelling approaches have consistently failed to correctly predict the nsP1 fold. Following iterative cycles of refinement in Phenix with NCS and model building in Coot, the entire protein sequence was built with the exception of N-terminal residues MG, loop regions 365-375 and 451-457 and C-terminal region 473-535; local resolution data suggests that map resolution in these regions is between 3-5Å. No overall differences in the structures are observed between D12 and C12 reconstructions, and as no contacts are observed between the double rings in the micelle, we assume that the single rings are the biologically relevant assembly. A paper describing the overall structure of nsP1 has been submitted, and we hope to publish it within the next few months. Briefly, the structure exhibits a central capping domain that is highly conserved between other N7 methyltransferases, in addition to auxillary domains that mediate pore-formation, oligomerisation between protomers and membrane binding that could not be predicted from the protein's sequence. The structure reveals an unexpected mode of membrane association, and provides a molecular rationale for the interdependence of membrane binding and complex formation. These details provide the first structural basis for the dependence of nsP1 capping activity on membrane association. In addition, the dimensions of the rings have important implications for the viral replication cycle; corresponding very well with those observed at the entrance of the membrane organelles (spherules) where alphaviral replication occurs. This structure, the first of it's kind for a +ssRNA virus, has allowed us to propose a novel role for nsP1 in alphaviral replication.</p><p>For future experiments, we hope to obtain cryo-EM structures of the nsP1 complexes in complex with capping intermediates, ssRNA, and possibly with other alphaviral nsPs. To improve future data collections, we are currently trialling ways to improve image contrast through altering the composition of the sample buffer, and are looking for ways to separate the double and single rings during purification and prior to application to grids. We are extremenly grateful to Eaazhisai for her help during data collection, and advice regarding data processing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure 1: Plot of per-micrograph motion from MotionCorr2 (left), and histogram of maximum micrograph resolution estimated from CTFFind4 (right).
