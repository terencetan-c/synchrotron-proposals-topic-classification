<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>On the basis of a detailed study of the ice microstructure of the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) ice core at Dome Concordia, Antarctica, we analyze the effect of impurities (solubles, and insolubles, that is, dust particles) on the grain growth process in cold ice sheets. As a general trend, the average grain size increases with depth. This global increase, induced by the normal grain growth process, is punctuated by several sharp decreases that can be associated with glacial-interglacial climatic transitions. To explain the modifications of the microstructure with climatic changes, we discuss the role of soluble and insoluble impurities on the grain growth process, coupled with an analysis of the pinning of grain boundaries by microparticles. Our data indicate that high soluble impurity content does not necessarily imply a slowdown of grain growth kinetics, whereas the pinning of grain boundaries by dust explains all the observed modifications of the microstructure. We propose a numerical model of the evolution of the average grain size in deep ice cores that takes into account recrystallization processes such as normal grain growth and rotation recrystallization as well as the pinning effect induced by dust particles, bubbles, and clathrates on the grain boundaries. Applied to the first 2135 m of the Dome Concordia core, the model reproduces accurately the measured mean grain radius. This indicates a major role of dust in the modification of polar ice microstructure and shows that the average grain size is not a true paleothermometer, as it is correlated with climatic transitions through the dust content of the ice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>[2] Deep drilling within cold ice sheets is an extraordinary tool for paleoclimatic studies. Even though traditionally most of the information on paleoclimate comes from water isotopes and chemical analyses, the study of ice microstructure (grain sizes and grain shapes) is of great interest. Indeed, the microstructure controls many physical properties of the ice <ref type="bibr">[Alley et al., 1986a]</ref>, the grain size could have an effect on the ice sheet strain rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Cuffey et al., 2000]</ref>, and the microstructure can record the past deformation <ref type="bibr">[Durand et al., 2004]</ref> or the climatic history.</p><p>[3] In the nearly isothermal upper part of cold ice sheets corresponding to Holocene ice, the average grain size increases with depth <ref type="bibr">[Alley et al., 1986a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gow, 1969]</ref>: this is the normal grain growth process driven by a reduction in the total grain boundary energy within the material [see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ralph, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996]</ref> for a general introduction on grain growth in polycrystalline materials). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Duval and Lorius [1980]</ref> observed a sharp decrease of the average grain size associated to the climatic transition Holocene -Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) along the first Dome C ice core. Since then, several explanations have been proposed to explain this correlation between grain size and climate, including drag on grain boundary migration by soluble impurities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Alley and Woods, 1996]</ref>, pinning by (insoluble) microparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Fisher and Koerner, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gow et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jun et al., 1998]</ref>, or an effect of surface temperature conditions at the time of deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[Petit et al., 1987]</ref>. However, because many parameters, including isotopic record, conductivity, concentrations of different soluble impurities or of dust particles, together exhibit abrupt changes at climatic transitions, it seems difficult to determine the correct mechanism only on the basis of correlations between the average grain size and these parameters.</p><p>[4] During the last 30 years, most of the studies on polar ice microstructure focused on the evolution of the average grain size with depth, and so age. This average grain size was generally determined by manual counting on 2D thin sections of ice, a tedious and time consuming process. Today, image analysis allows an automatic extraction of the microstructure (the grain boundaries, noted as GB in what follows) from 2D thin sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Gay and Weiss, 1999]</ref>. This improves the accuracy of the estimation of the average grain size (better statistics), and allows the determination of other microstructural characteristics such as grain size distributions, grain shape anisotropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Arnaud et al., 2000]</ref>, or even the strain tensor recorded by the microstructure <ref type="bibr">[Durand et al., 2004]</ref>. In this paper, we analyze the grain growth process in cold ice sheets and the effect of impurities (solubles and insolubles) in the light of such detailed studies of the microstructure. Other recrystallization processes take place in polar ice, such as rotation and migration recrystallization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[De La Chapelle et al., 1998]</ref>. Induced by deformation, these mechanisms do not significantly affect the ice microstructure in shallow ice. Migration recrystallization, which results from the rapid migration of GB between dislocation-free nuclei and deformed grains, occurs only at temperatures above À10°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Duval and Castelnau, 1995]</ref> corresponding to depths below 2925 m for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome Concordia ice core analyzed here, that is, much below the explored depth range (100-2200 m). Rotation recrystallization is characterized by basal dislocations that group together in walls perpendicular to slip planes to form subboundaries. In the end, this process leads to the division of old grains into smaller grains, that is, decreases the average grain size. In the Byrd ice core of Antarctica, this process is strong enough to fully balance grain growth from the depth of 400 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Alley et al., 1995]</ref>; in the GRIP ice core of Greenland, the depth is 650 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[Thorsteinsson et al., 1997]</ref>). On the other hand, the average grain size increases at least down to 2500 m along the Vostok ice core (Antarctica), showing that rotation recrystallization is unable to balance grain growth down to this depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Duval and Castelnau, 1995]</ref>. As shown in this paper, the same result is observed for the EPICA ice core.</p><p>[5] This work is based mainly on an analysis of the EPICA ice core at Dome Concordia, Antarctica. The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we recall the classical models of grain growth in polycrystalline materials and the effects of impurities that are essential for the forthcoming discussion; section 3 presents the data available from the EPICA ice core (microstructure, dust content, ion concentrations, bubbles and clathrates evolution) and an analysis of the localization of dust particles within the ice from X-ray tomography; section 4 describes the motivations for modeling the mean grain size evolution as well as the structure of the proposed model; section 5 discusses the different mechanisms which could explain the grain size profile, on the basis of (1) the correlation between grain size and other parameters and (2) the results of the model. Section 6 presents our conclusions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Growth Kinetics Without Impurities</head><p>[6] The driving force for grain growth in polycrystalline materials is a reduction in the total grain boundary energy within the material. To derive growth kinetics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke and Turnbull [1952]</ref> ignored the environment of a grain, that is, the structural and topological constraints within an assembly of grains, and assumed the boundary is part of a sphere.</p><p>They obtained the following expression for the grain boundary velocity v:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v ¼ m g R<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where m is the mobility, g the grain boundary free energy and R the grain radius. Further assuming that dR/dt is proportional to v, that is dR dt = m ag R = mP (where a is a small geometric constant, and P = ag/R represents the driving force), they deduced the following, so-called parabolic, grain growth kinetics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R 2 À R 2 0 ¼ 2Kt<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where R 0 is the initial grain size and K is an Arrhenius temperature-dependent constant.</p><p>[7] One of the shortcoming of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke and Turnbull [1952]</ref> analysis was to ignore the topological space-filling requirements within an assembly of grains. As a consequence of these requirements, large grains grow at small grains expense. The simplest way to model these requirements is a mean field approach that considers an isolated grain embedded in an environment representing the average effect of the whole array of grains. Such approach was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hillert [1965]</ref>, and predicted a parabolic growth kinetics. Other mean field theories of grain growth have been proposed in the literature [see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996]</ref>, most of them predicting parabolic growth kinetics as well.</p><p>[8] The exponent 2 in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is a lower bound derived from mean field approximations. Most of the experimental data in different materials are better described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">hRi m À hR 0 i m ¼ 2K 0 t<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>with m lying between 2 and 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Higgins, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ralph, 1990]</ref>. hR 0 i is the average grain size at time t = 0 and K 0 is the apparent grain growth constant. On the other hand, numerical models of grain growth based on Monte Carlo simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Anderson et al., 1989]</ref> or on vertex dynamics <ref type="bibr">[Weygand et al., 1998]</ref> give values of m very close to the lower bound 2. Therefore departure from m = 2 is thought to result from solute drag <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Fan et al., 1999]</ref>, interactions with microparticles, the effect of texture, or a nonsteady state regime <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Ralph, 1990]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> In the regime of normal grain growth, the distribution of normalized grain sizes R i /hRi remains unchanged, unimodal, and is generally well fitted by a lognormal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ralph, 1990]</ref>. To date, however, this lognormal fit has no theoretical support. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hillert [1965]</ref> deduced, from his mean field approach, a unimodal distribution slightly different from a lognormal. If one starts from a distribution with a different shape (at t = 0), a transient regime is observed with an evolving distribution <ref type="bibr">[Weygand, 1998]</ref>. Normal grain growth only refers to the steady state. Whereas solute drag does not modify the shape of the distribution, microparticles do (see below).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Effect of Impurities</head><p>[10] Grain growth can be affected by different kinds of impurities including solutes, insoluble microparticles, or gas bubbles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Solutes</head><p>[11] In a low-velocity/low-driving force regime relevant for polar ice <ref type="bibr">[Alley et al., 1986a]</ref>, solutes are dragged by the moving boundaries. This drag of impurities reduces the grain boundary mobility m. The classical model of this effect, developed independently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cahn [1962]</ref> and Lu ¨cke and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Detert [1957]</ref> is of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">m c ð Þ ¼ m i 1 þ m i lc<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where c is the impurity concentration, m i the intrinsic mobility of the boundary and l a constant [see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lu ¨cke and Stu ¨we, 1971</ref>]. This classical model does not predict any modification of the exponent m in the grain growth equation. However, recent 2D numerical simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Fan et al., 1999]</ref> suggest that solute drag may significantly increase m when the solute diffusivity in the lattice is small compared to the intrinsic boundary mobility. In any case, solute drag does not modify the normalized grain size distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Fan et al., 1999]</ref>. Indeed, a reduction of mobility would apply equally to all grain boundaries. In this situation, although the global kinetics would be slowed down, the behavior of one grain relative to others would remain unchanged, and so would the normalized distribution of grain sizes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Second-Phase Particles</head><p>[12] Large (relatively to solute atoms) second-phase particles, such as dust particles in polar ice, cannot be dragged by a moving boundary. Rather, they pin these boundaries. The role of pinning on the grain growth process depends on the location of particles (see below), as well as on the ratio between the average grain size and the mean distance between particles. For small grain sizes compared to large interparticle distances, most of the boundaries ''do not feel'' the particles and so the global growth process is unchanged. For small interparticle distances, most of the boundaries are pinned and the growth process is completely stopped. A transient behavior is found in between <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weygand et al., 1998</ref>].</p><p>[13] Zener (cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Smith [1948]</ref>) was the first to model this pinning effect. The interaction between a boundary of free energy g and a spherical particle of radius r d leads to the following restraining force F Z :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F Z ¼ pgr d<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>Averaging the effect of N d particles per unit volume gives an expression for the (average) pinning pressure P Z exerted by the particles on unit area of boundary, assuming that all the particles have the same radius r d <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996]</ref>. P Z depends on the particle distribution within the matter. It is larger when particles are concentrated along the boundaries or at grain vertices rather than distributed randomly within the volume, as the boundaries ''feel'' a larger particle density. As shown below, this point is essential in the case of polar ice. Corresponding expressions for P Z are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. This pinning pressure works against the driving force for grain boundary motion, P.</p><p>Hence, in the presence of pinning, equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) can be modified as <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">dR dt ¼ m P À P Z ð Þ¼K 1 R À 1 R Z ¼ K 0 e ÀE A R G T 1 R À P Z ag<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><p>where K = mag is an Arrhenius temperature-dependent constant, with an activation energy E A and a grain growth constant K 0 expressed in mm 2 yr À1 , and R G is the perfect gas law constant. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) shows clearly the nonlinear decay of the growth rate dR/dt toward zero as the grain size R approaches R Z . In the limiting case P = P Z , the growth process is stopped and Zener <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[Smith, 1948]</ref> deduced a corresponding limiting (maximum) grain size R Z whose expressions are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Zener originally set the geometrical constant a to 1, but more recent models and observations argue for lower values between 0.25 and 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996]</ref>. During the transient stage when R increases toward R Z , the growth rate dR/dt, driven by P À P Z , decreases toward zero. This may be (incorrectly) interpreted as an (apparent) increase of the exponent m in the growth kinetics (equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>)) compared to the lower bound m = 2.</p><p>[14] It is worth noting that unlike the drag of solutes, pinning does not reduce the mobility m, but rather modifies not uniformly the driving force for boundary migration. Consequently, normalized (R i /hRi) grain size distributions are modified by pinning <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[Riege et al., 1998]</ref>. Analytical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Abbruzzese and Lucke, 1992]</ref>, 2D <ref type="bibr">[Weygand, 1998]</ref> and 3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[Song et al., 2000]</ref> numerical simulations of Zener pinning, and some experimental evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[Tweed et al., 1982]</ref> argue for narrower normalized distributions (i.e., smaller standard deviation) for pinned microstructures, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[Riege et al., 1998</ref>] reported a shift of the mean for a 2D simulation.</p><p>[15] Under some circumstances, GB may unpin from particles or pores. This process has been explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gore et al. [1989]</ref>, who showed that a thermally activated unpinning of GB from submicronic particles in ferrous alloys could lead to an underestimation of the grain size by the classical Zener approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gore et al. [1989]</ref> proposed the following expression for the ratio of impurities leaving GB per unit time, that is, the rate of unpinning, dp U /dt: 1 2 a P Z x is the pinning pressure exerted by N x objects (dust particle, bubble, or clathrate), and R Z x is the induced limiting grain size. The expressions of P Z x can be added to estimate the total contribution of (1) different objects x or (2) x-type objects with different size r x . The corresponding limiting radius is deduced from equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) with dR dt = 0.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">dp U dt ¼ n 0 exp À E U R G T<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>where n 0 is the attempt frequency for unpinning, R G the perfect gas law constant and E U is an activation energy.</p><p>During dt, the proportion of dust particles randomly distributed p ran increases by dp U , whereas the proportion of dust particles along grain boundaries p gb decreases by dp U . As p ran increases to the detriment of p gb , the unpinning process implies an increase of the limiting grain size, therefore allowing further normal grain growth. n 0 , and consequently dp U strongly decreases with increasing average particle radius. At timescales relevant to metallurgy ($hours), unpinning is significant for particle sizes below 100 nm, that is, much smaller than the dust particles contained within polar ice ($1 mm). However the timescales involved in ice sheet flow are 8 to 10 orders of magnitude larger, making the unpinning likely within polar ice. This problem will be discussed in more details in section 5.7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Bubbles</head><p>[16] The effect of gas bubbles in polar ice on grain growth can be considered as being intermediate between solute drag and particles pinning. Bubbles exert a pinning effect on grain boundaries in a similar manner to second-phase particles <ref type="bibr">[Alley et al., 1986a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Humphreys and Hatherly, 1996]</ref>. The mechanisms and relations summarized in the previous section are therefore relevant. However, once the average grain size has reached the limiting grain size set by the bubbles, grain boundaries can drag the bubbles in a lowvelocity regime, therefore allowing further (slow) grain growth. In this case, the boundaries mobility is dictated by the bubble mobility. This bubble mobility depends on the diffusion mechanism allowing transport of matter across the bubble, which can be either vapor diffusion, surface diffusion, or lattice diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[Nichols, 1966]</ref>. As shown below and already discussed by <ref type="bibr">Alley et al. [1986a]</ref>, in the shallow part of cold ice sheets where bubbles are still present, their associated limiting grain size is much larger than the average grain size, therefore excluding the relevance of this low-velocity regime. Such analysis led <ref type="bibr">[Alley et al., 1986b]</ref> to conclude that, for the Byrd ice core, the bubbles slow the grain growth in shallow ice by about 10%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Rotation Recrystallization</head><p>[17] The effect of the rotation recrystallization on the grain size can be estimated following the dislocation density-based modeling framework proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Montagnat and Duval [2000]</ref>. The evolution of the dislocation density r with depth is the result of different terms: (1) the increase of r due to the work hardening and (2) a decrease of r induced by the grain boundaries migration as dislocations located in the area swept by the boundary disappear. Then, the evolution of the dislocation density can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">dr dt ¼ _ e 2bR À br dR dt R<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>where _ e is the strain rate, b the Burgers vector, dR dt is defined by equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) and b is a coefficient which indicates a possible heterogeneous location of the dislocations within the grain (i.e., higher density near grain boundaries if b &gt; 1).</p><p>[18] The decrease of the dislocation density by the formation of a subboundary can be calculated assuming that subgrains misoriented by an angle q contain only geometrically necessary dislocations. Therefore the associated dislocation density r sb = q bR is consumed for the formation of a subboundary of average size 2R. It is further assumed that when q reaches a threshold value q c = 5°, the subboundary becomes a true grain boundary. Averaged over the whole grain population, this threshold value q c corresponds to a threshold dislocation density r c . Rotation recrystallization is assumed to start when r reaches r c . If r exceed r c , the dislocation density excess Dr = r À r c produced by the deformation (integration of equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">8</ref>)) is entirely consumed by the rotation recrystallization. Following this assumption, rotation recrystallization induces a negative contribution to the grain growth rate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">dR dt j plg ¼ À bR 2 q c Â dr sb dt ¼ À bR 2 q c Â Dr Dt<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>3. Available Records for Microstructure and Impurities</p><p>[19] A large part of the present work is based on data recorded along the EPICA ice core at Dome Concordia, Antarctica (75°06 0 S, 123°20 0 E, elevation 3233 m a.s.l). This ice-coring program reached the depth of 3270.20 m during the 2004 -2005 field season. Here we present an analysis of the microstructure from 100 m (firn-ice transition) to 2200 m. The Dome Concordia ice core provides a unique opportunity for a study of grain growth within cold ice sheets (as well as other recrystallization phenomena), as detailed records of the microstructure, dust content and chemistry are available.</p><p>[20] As grain growth is a time-dependent process, the different records analyzed below have been plotted against the depth as well as the age of the layer. We used the official dating model for the depth-age correspondence <ref type="bibr">[EPICA Community Members, 2004]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Microstructure</head><p>[21] Vertical thin sections of ice were prepared in the field along the EPICA core between 100 m (which corresponds roughly to the close-off depth) and 2200 m, then digitized and analyzed using an image analysis processing described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gay and Weiss [1999]</ref> in order to extract the microstructure in 2D. An example of extracted microstructure is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. At least, one section has been digitized every 10 m of the core. Around each climatic transition, which are associated with a change in the mean grain size, we increased the sampling rate to one section every 5 m or more. In addition, thin sections were prepared and digitized at depths corresponding to special events such as a dust layer or a dielectric profiling (DEP) peak <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[Wolff et al., 1999]</ref>. Because we used the same image resolution everywhere (1 pixel = 50 mm) and because the mean grain size is generally increasing with depth, we adjusted the image size individually between 30 Â 20 mm 2 and 40 Â 60 mm 2 in order to always sample a statistically significant grain population, that is, more than 100 grains.</p><p>[22] The average grain size (or grain radius) hRi was calculated over the entire population of grains of a section by the arithmetic average of the square root of the grain area, hA 1 2 i. This definition differs from the methods previously used to determine manually the average grain size on thin sections of polar ice, such as the linear intercept method <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Alley and Woods, 1996]</ref> or the average size of the 50 largest grains within the section <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Gow, 1969]</ref>. However, as stressed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gay and Weiss [1999]</ref>, the estimation of hRi from hA 1 2 i gives the best 2D estimate of 3D grain growth kinetics.</p><p>[23] The standard deviation on the estimation of the average grain size, s hRi , has been estimated from a 3D numerical Potts model, known to well reproduce the topology of a 3D microstructure under normal grain growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Anderson et al., 1989]</ref>. On this modeled 3D microstructure we estimated the standard deviation of hRi induced by calculating hRi from a 2D cut of a 3D microstructure, as well as the standard deviation induced by the number of grains, N g , within the section: s hRi /hRi = 0.02 + 0.44 Â N g À1/2 <ref type="bibr">[Durand, 2004]</ref>.</p><p>[24] All the observed distributions of normalized grain sizes are well fitted by lognormal distributions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Arnaud et al. [2000]</ref> for examples within the shallow part of the ice sheet). These distributions are therefore characterized by only two independent parameters, the average and the standard deviation of ln (R i /hRi).</p><p>[25] Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the profiles of the average grain size hRi (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), of the two parameters of the distributions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), along with the available deuterium profile <ref type="bibr">[EPICA Community Members, 2004]</ref> which is a proxy of local temperature change (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows an increase of the average grain size with time, however punctuated by abrupt decreases clearly synchronous with Termination I, with the transition between stages 3.3 and 4.2, and with termination II. Interestingly, the two parameters of the normalized distribution show also synchronous variations with deuterium, despite a larger signal/ noise ratio. The fact that hRi still increases with depth down to 2200 m indicates that rotation recrystallization is unable to fully balance grain growth, as it was observed for the Vostok core.</p><p>[26] The Holocene is characterized by a very stable climatic signal as well as low-soluble and insoluble impurity contents (except for specific layers associated with volcanic events). Nevertheless, the Dome Concordia grain size data within the Holocene (100 -450 m) departs from equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), as it is best fitted by equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) with m = 3.2 ± 0.2, K 0 = 2.8 Â 10 À4 ± 0.2 Â 10 À4 and hR 0 i = 3.10 À5 ± 1.10 À5 mm. A similar observation was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Thorsteinsson et al. [1997]</ref> for the GRIP ice core with m = 2.5, though not explained. As discussed in section 5.4, this departure from the theoretical parabolic growth law (equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)) is likely the result of bubbles pinning. Note that the physical meaning of the value of hR 0 i has to be taken with caution, as it does not correspond to a measured value of grain size at the ice sheet surface: different processes other than normal grain growth could take place within the snow and the upper firn.</p><p>[27] In some places, ''continuous'' grain size analyses have been performed. Vertical thin sections of 55 or 110 cm long have been digitized to extract the microstructure. Then, linear intercept analysis was performed along horizontal lines at a resolution of 1 pixel, that is, 50 mm. The relation between the average linear intercept hLi and the average grain size hR i = hA 1 2 i depends on the morphology of the grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[Underwood, 1970]</ref>. In the present case, the ratio hLi/hRi was found stable around 1.15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Gay and Weiss, 1999]</ref>. The linear intercept measurements of the continuous analyses have been corrected consequently. These continuous analyses allowed to study special events such as volcanic eruptions (see section 5.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Impurities</head><p>[28] Section 2 has stressed the importance of impurities for grain growth in polycrystalline materials. Impurities contained in polar ice can be classified in two categories: insoluble and soluble (in water after melting).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Insoluble Second-Phase Particles</head><p>[29] In polar ice, insoluble impurities consist of dust microparticles that are of two different origins: continental aerosols and volcanic ashes. The number and size distribution of dust particles has been measured along the Dome Concordia ice core down to 2200 m with a sampling period of 5.5 m using a Coulter counter. The record is detailed and analyzed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Delmonte et al. [2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Delmonte et al. [ , 2004]]</ref>. The number of particles N d per unit volume of ice, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>, exhibit very strong variations synchronous with climate changes, as observed previously in other ice cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[Petit et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Steffensen, 1997]</ref>. The particle radius distributions are well fitted by lognormal distributions. To estimate the pinning pressure resulting from the particles, P Z , we  summed the contributions of all the classes of size of the distribution, from the notation of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Note also that the mode of the distribution is also slightly changing with climate, for example, from 1.03 ± 0.10 mm in Holocene to 0.96 ± 0.01 mm for LGM (for the volume-size distribution) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Delmonte et al., 2002]</ref>. However, in terms of pinning effect (section 2.3.2 and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), this 7% increase of the mode from LGM to Holocene is completely negligible compared to the decrease of the number of particles by a factor of about 50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Localization of Dust Particles</head><p>[30] As explained in section 2.3.2, the average pinning effect of particles on grain growth depends on how the particles are distributed within the matter. Assuming a uniform distribution of particles within the volume, <ref type="bibr">Alley et al. [1986b]</ref> concluded that the amounts of dust measured in polar ice were not large enough to significantly affect grain growth, except for layers with volcanic ashes. However, scanning electron microscopy observations of surfaces of Dome Concordia ice samples suggest that a large proportion of particles are located along GB <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Barnes et al., 2002]</ref>. This may not be the case for Greenland (GRIP) ice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Barnes et al., 2002]</ref>.</p><p>[31] An EPICA ice sample taken at a depth of 578.05 m corresponding to LGM ice was analyzed using X-ray tomography <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[Peix et al., 2000]</ref> at the European Synchrotron Research Facility in Grenoble (ESRF). This non destructive technique gives series of superposed 2D images that are used to build a 3D image of the analyzed volume. The resolution (the voxel size) was 0.923 mm 3 . The analyzed volume was a cylinder with a diameter of 1024 pixels and a height of 3072 pixels. Because of the limited sampled ice volume (1970 mm 3 ), only few grains and GB were contained in this sample. Dust particles of the order of, or larger than the voxel size were easily identified and located, therefore giving a 3D spatial distribution of dust particles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Given the resolution of the analysis, only the largest particles were located, as the mean diameter of particles is around 1 mm. Coupled with the fact that GB are not resolved by this tomography, it implies that a clear structure is difficult to discern in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Instead, we performed a correlation analysis of the particle locations in order to determine the correlation dimension [see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Korvin, 1992]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C x ð Þ ¼ 2 n n À 1 ð Þ N ca x 0 &lt; x ð Þ<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>where n is the number of locations considered and N ca (x 0 &lt; x) the number of pairs of locations separated by a distance x 0 smaller than x. The scaling of C(x) gives the dimension D of the support of the distribution, C(x) $ x D . For the dust particles, we found D = 1.45 ± 0.1 (thick line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). To test the confidence level on this measure as well as a possible effect of the geometry of the sample, we simulated three types of random spatial distributions of particles within the sampled volume. The first (second) type of distribution corresponds to particles randomly distributed along a line (along a plane) contained in the cylinder. For the third type, the particles were randomly distributed within the volume (Poisson distribution). The correlation analysis of these distributions is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. The experimental data are comparable with the planar random distributions, but cannot result from a 3D random distribution. This indicates that the particles (at least the largest ones) are not uniformly distributed within the volume, rather over a surface. GB being the only 2D structures within polar ice at this depth, this analysis strongly suggests that dust particles are located along GB. Moreover, as the correlation dimension is significantly lower than 2, this analysis suggests a possible clustering (near grain edges?) of particles over the GB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Soluble Impurities</head><p>[32] The soluble impurity content of the Dome Concordia ice core is known from continuous flow analysis (CFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[Ro ¨thlisberger et al., 2000]</ref> and fast ion chromatography (FIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[Traversi et al., 2002]</ref>. CFA gives a complete record of the liquid conductivity, as well as of major ions (Na + , Ca 2+ , NO 3 À , NH 4 + ), at a resolution of approximately 1 cm, while FIC measurements of Cl À , NO 3 À and SO 4 2À resulted in a resolution of approximately 4 cm. Liquid conductivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref>) has been considered as a proxy of the total soluble impurity content <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[Hammer, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fisher and Koerner, 1986]</ref>. However, this relation between liquid conductivity and soluble impurity content is complex, different species contributing differently to the total conductivity.</p><p>[33] CFA does not provide information about the localization of these impurities (within the lattice, within inclusions, along grain boundaries), or about their nature  This zone shows the variability of this analysis for various random distributions along various lines. Hatched zone 2 is the same as hatched zone 1 but for particles randomly distributed over a plane. Hatched zone 3 is the same as hatched zone 1 but for particles randomly distributed within the cylinder.</p><p>(solutes, precipitates, aqueous solutions along boundaries). Whereas X-ray microanalysis has shown that H 2 SO 4 is concentrated along grain boundaries and especially at vertices, sea salts (essentially NaCl) do not show such localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Fukazawa et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Wolff et al., 1988]</ref>. Recent chemical analyses of large single crystals in the bottom of the Vostok ice core <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[Montagnat et al., 2001]</ref> show large and spatially homogeneous concentrations (up to 1 ppm) of salts (Na and Cl) that argue for the presence of these species as solutes. In both cases, it is fair to assume that the effect of these soluble impurities on grain growth, if any, will be through a decrease of GB mobility (section 2.3.1), although the quantification of this effect (e.g., the parameter l in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>)) is completely unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Bubbles and Clathrates</head><p>[34] In polar ice, bubbles result from the closure of porosities during densification. Therefore they are, at least initially, located at grains vertices or along GB. Then, their size decreases as they are closing with depth. When the overburden pressure is large enough, clathrates form. Clathrates pin the boundaries, as dust particles and bubbles do <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[Uchida et al., 1993]</ref>, although the evolution of clathrates with depth and time, as well as their interaction with GB, are still unclear.</p><p>[35] The information available on the bubble content of the Dome Concordia ice core is limited to the first 800 m (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). Consequently, we completed this data set with the more detailed profile measured on the Vostok ice core. Such comparison seems to be relevant as the surface temperature and the accumulation rates of the two sites are relatively similar. However, the measurements of bubbles below 360 m on the Dome C core have been done on relaxed ice. Therefore the measured bubble radius is certainly overestimated compare to their previous radius in unrelaxed state, and the Vostok record (measurement made on fresh ice) gives a better in situ estimation. Considering the location of bubbles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gow [1968]</ref> reported a uniform distribution of bubbles whatever the depth along the Byrd ice core. The situation appears to be different for colder ice. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the relative locations of bubbles and clathrates along the Vostok ice core. These observations show that (1) the bubbles have a preponderant location along GB in shallow ice, and (2) the proportion of bubbles randomly located in the ice increase with depth. This indicates that grain boundaries can partly unpin from bubbles (the same behavior is observed for clathrates).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Average Grain Size Evolution: A Model</head><p>[36] As mentioned above, most polar ice microstructure studies performed so far focused on correlations between grain size and different parameters. However, because many parameters exhibit variations in phase with the climatic transitions, the correlation studies do not allow selection of one mechanism over another. Moreover, such studies are qualitative in the sense that they cannot provide any information on the relative contribution of the different mechanisms. In order to avoid these problems, we decided  to model the grain size evolution along the Dome Concordia core using the equations widely used in material science and summarized in section 2. This enlightens the predominant processes acting against grain growth. Moreover, discrepancies between data and model results might reveal that some mechanism is not taken into account.</p><p>[37] The model proposed here is one-dimensional, as it calculates the evolution of the grain size, R, with the vertical coordinate z (the depth) only. It simulates the evolution of an (average) grain size with depth, but does not give any information about grain size distributions. At each time step, the model calculates the grain size increment dR/dt for an ice layer, following equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>). The integration is performed all along the sinking history of the considered layer, from its deposition to its present depth. Then, the calculation is repeated for many different layers, the ones for which a measure of the dust content is available.</p><p>[38] The different processes taken into account in the present model are listed below. The details concerning the implementation of each process into the model can be found by <ref type="bibr">Durand [2004, section 3.3</ref>].</p><p>[39] 1. The normal grain growth is taken into account through the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Burke and Turnbull [1952]</ref> analysis and equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>).</p><p>[40] 2. The temperature changes experienced by the ice layer along its sink are given by a temperature model <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[Ritz, 1989]</ref> and affect the normal grain growth rate through the Arrhenius temperature-dependent parameter K. This temperature model takes into account (1) temperature gradients between the surface and the bedrock and (2) the evolution of the surface temperature with climate. These temperature profiles are used as input data for our grain growth model, and cannot be ''adjusted'' to improve the modeling of the grain size profile.</p><p>[41] 3. The pinning effect is also described by equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>), through the pinning pressure P Z . It is worth noting that P Z results from the contribution of different pinning objects:</p><p>(1) dust particles and (2) bubbles and clathrates. The number and size of dust particles are given by Coulter Counter measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Delmonte et al., 2002]</ref>, and as suggested by our X-ray tomography analysis we first assume that all the particles are located along the grain boundaries (see section 3.2.2). This allows to calculate P Z induced by the dust particles from the equations given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For bubbles and clathrates, the parameters needed to calculate the associated pinning pressure are parameterized from our observations. The bubbles density N b is estimated through an empirical linear relationship between the number of bubbles and the temperature at the time of deposition (data not shown). Once N b is known, it allows to estimate the mean bubble radius through the volume of air inclusion V i , where V i is estimated through porosity measurements. These rough parameterizations give results in good agreement with the measurements (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). In the transition zone, N b decrease linearly to the benefit of the clathrate density: we assume than one bubble transforms into one clathrate, in agreement with observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Lipenkov, 2000]</ref>. Concerning the bubbles and clathrates location, the model simply follows the evolution deduced from our observations (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). More Details on the bubbles-clathrates parameterization can be found in work by <ref type="bibr">Durand [2004]</ref>.</p><p>[42] 4. Unpinning of grain boundaries from dust particles will also be envisaged using the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gore et al. [1989]</ref> through equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>). This leads to a change in location of the dust particles, and then induces a decrease of their pinning pressure.</p><p>[43] 5. As previously mentioned, rotation recrystallization is likely in the depth range studied here. Its implementation within the model is done through the equations detailed in section 2.4. It is worth noting that this rotation recrystallization module does not introduce any additional adjustable parameter to the model. The values of b = 2 and q c = 5°, used in this work, are based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Montagnat and Duval [2000]</ref> on the GRIP ice core.</p><p>[44] As detailed in the following sections 5.1 and 5.2, several arguments indicate that the memory effect of the surface temperature as well as the drag of soluble impurities do not have a significant impact on the grain size along the Dome Concordia ice core. Consequently, the model does not take these mechanisms into account.</p><p>[45] Some of the parameters entering equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>) have been measured along the Dome Concordia ice core or have been determined from simple physics as well as empirical relations (see <ref type="bibr">Durand [2004]</ref> for details). The three remaining key parameters, K 0 , E A and a, cannot be estimated directly from independent measures along the core. To set the values of the triplets (K 0 , E A , a), we calculated the mean deviation between the model and the data over the depth range 100-500 m, which includes the termination I and the Holocene, for numerous triplets within the ranges 0.25 a 1, 1.10 7 mm 2 .yr À1 K 0 5.10 8 mm 2 .yr À1 and 42 kJ.mol À1 E A 53 kJ.mol À1 , which are compatible with values given in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[Paterson, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Duval, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gow, 1969]</ref>. Note that the values of K 0 and E A found in the literature are estimated directly from the measurements of the empirical parameter K 0 , therefore the effects of impurities on normal grain growth was implicitly taken into account.</p><p>[46] In a first step, we eliminated the triplets which deviate from the data more than the intrinsic variability of hRi (see section 3.1). This constrains a within the range 0.25-0.5, and the couple (K 0 , E A ) within a band of values that correspond to the same value of the growth rate K = K 0 exp (ÀE A /RT) = 1 Â 10 À4 mm 2 .yr À1 . Indeed, as the upper ice sheet is almost isothermal, the sensitivity of K to the temperature is small within the depth range 100 -500 m. We fixed the activation energy to 46 kJ.mol À1 , close to the median value of the acceptable range. Consequently, K 0 is fixed to 1.10 7 mm 2 .yr À1 . The sensitivity of the model on a is larger, and the best fit between R and hRi within the depth range 100 -500 m is obtain for a = 0.25. This low value of a expresses a strong effect of pinning (equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>)). With the triplet (K 0 , E A , a) fixed, we can now model the whole grain size profile down to 2135 m, and test its sensitivity to different parameters such as the temperature, the bubble or the dust content.</p></div>

They assumed that the grain boundary mobility m, and consequently K, were proportional to the concentration of interstitials (point defects), c i , which in turn was supposed to follow an Arrhenius temperature dependence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c i $ exp (ÀE f /RT 0 )</formula><p>, where E f is an apparent formation energy of interstitials and T 0 is the surface temperature at the time of deposition. In terms of grain boundary velocity, the interstitials are assumed to affect the mobility m, but not the driving force. With this mechanism, the average grain size becomes a true paleothermometer. The mechanism was proposed on the basis of a good correlation between the d 18 O record and the average grain size for the former Dome C ice core <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Duval and Lorius, 1980]</ref>.

In the reverse, the transition from stage 3.3 to stage 4.2 around 58,000 BP is marked by a grain size decrease as large as the decreases observed for termination I and II whereas the corresponding surface temperature drop is limited (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>[51] 2. As explained in section 2.3.1 for solute drag, a reduction of mobility does not modify normalized grain size distributions. Therefore the profiles of the average and the standard deviation of ln (R i /hRi) (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) contradict this scenario.</p><p>[52] 3. In the shallow ice of Dome Concordia, we identified a few layers with abnormally small grain sizes (marked with solid circles in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) generally associated with volcanic ash layers detectable by eye (e.g., at a depth of 339.5 m, that is, about 11200 BP). These layers show the same trend as glacial ice for the three independent grain size parameters (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>). Since there is no reason to expect a high concentration of interstitials associated with these volcanic ash layers in the Holocene, the scenario of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Petit et al. [1987]</ref> is unable to provide a universal explanation for the modification of the ice microstructure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Drag of Soluble Impurities</head><p>[53] On the basis of correlations between soluble impurity content and grain size along the GISP2 ice core in Greenland, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alley and Woods [1996]</ref> suggested that soluble impurity drag may significantly affect the grain growth rate, although they acknowledged the noisy character of the data. However, as noted previously, such correlations are not discriminant, as many parameters, including isotopes, conductivity, concentrations of different soluble impurities or of microparticles, grain size, which exhibit simultaneous changes at climatic transitions. Moreover, this hypothesis is in contradiction with the following observations:</p><p>[54] 1. Soluble impurities, like interstitials in the scenario of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Petit et al. [1987]</ref> (see above), modify the mobility and not the driving force. Therefore the second argument of section 5.1 holds. That is, soluble impurity drag cannot explain the modification of the normalized grain size distributions.</p><p>[55] 2. To analyze possible positive correlations between retardation of grain growth and the soluble impurity content, we define a new adimensional parameter R * :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">R * ¼ R 2 À R 2 0 hRi 2 À R 2 0 ! À 1<label>ð11Þ</label></formula><p>Here for a given depth corresponding to a measured grain size hRi, R is the theoretical grain size that the microstructure should have reached at the same depth, assuming a normal grain growth without any impurity effect: it is calculated from the model described in section 4, taking into account only the effect of temperature changes. Combining equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), it can be shown that R* should be proportional to the impurity concentration c if the grain size profile is explained by soluble impurity drag. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> shows the relation between the liquid conductivity, taken as a measure of overall soluble impurity content, and R*. From the chemical records of the Dome Concordia ice core, similar correlations between grain size and different species can be derived, such as SO 4 2À (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>), Na + (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>), or Ca 2+ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d</ref>). Once again, as many parameters are changing simultaneously, the correlations observed in some of these figures are not really informative and are associated with a large scatter. Some special layers are more instructive in this respect. These layers, selected in the field from the DEP profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[Wolff et al., 1999]</ref> show very large conductivities but ''normal'' grain sizes (R* % 0). This shows that large soluble impurity content do not necessarily imply abnormally small grain sizes, therefore raising questions about the effectiveness of soluble impurity drag to reduce the average grain size. In addition, large R* values are sometimes associated with relatively low impurity contents.</p><p>[56] These observations show that soluble impurities, incorporated into the ice either along GB or as solutes, do not significantly affect the grain growth process. One cannot however exclude a limited effect for very large soluble impurity concentrations and/or physical conditions (e.g., temperature) different from central Antarctica (e.g., in Greenland).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Variation of K With Temperature</head><p>[57] Because K (in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">6</ref>)) is an Arrhenius temperature-dependent constant, colder ice would theoretically imply a smaller growth rate and therefore smaller grains. The activation energy of grain growth in ice is estimated to be within the range 42.4-52 kJ/mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Gow, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jacka and Jun, 1994]</ref>. However, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Duval and Lorius [1980]</ref>, the difference in the growth temperature needed to explain the difference in average grain size between Holocene and LGM is far too large compared to surface temperature differences between glacial and interglacial periods. This is confirmed by the model outputs. In a first step, we run the model taking into account only the effect of temperature. It is clear from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> that the correlation of the grain size profile with climatic transitions is not directly induced by the surface temperature variations. Actually, the strongest effect of temperature is related to the increase of T with z. This is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> by a comparison between an isothermal profile (T = const = À55°C, the current surface temperature) and the profile taking into account all the temperature effects.</p><p>[58] In addition, we note that the grain size decrease observed at climatic transitions cannot be explained by a decrease of the initial grain size hR 0 i with surface temperature. Indeed, hR 0 i deduced from an extrapolation of grain growth to t = 0 (see section 3.1) is very small compared to the grain size decrease associated with climatic transitions (e.g., about 0.45 mm for the LGM-Holocene transition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Bubbles and Clathrates</head><p>[59] As detailed in section 3.1, we observed a grain growth law exponent (m = 3.2) larger than the theoretical exponent (m = 2) during the Holocene. The results of our model strongly suggest that the pinning effect of bubbles is responsible for this increase of m. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> shows the experimental data and two simulated profiles over the depth range 100-400 m corresponding to Holocene. The first profile takes into account only the temperature effect. It significantly deviates from the data and equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>) with m = 1.8 is the best fit. In this case m is lower than 2, as the 2À concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[Traversi et al., 2002]</ref>, (c) Na + concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[Ro ¨thlisberger et al., 2002]</ref>, (d) Ca 2+ concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[Ro ¨thlisberger et al., 2002]</ref>, and (e) Cl À concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[Traversi et al., 2002]</ref>. result of the increase of temperature with depth. The second profile takes into account the pinning effect of bubbles and dust (note that the effect of dust is relatively small for this depth range, $10%, see later). This simulated profile gives m = 2.7, that is, significantly larger than the parabolic exponent. This shows that the departure of the grain growth law from the theoretical kinetics is most likely the result of bubbles pinning. It is worth noting that R is much smaller than R Z during the Holocene (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9a</ref>), implying that the boundaries mobility is not governed by the bubbles mobility, as already discussed by <ref type="bibr">Alley et al. [1986a]</ref>.</p><p>[60] These effects of temperature increase with depth and of bubbles pinning, which act in an opposite way, are also present in other ice cores. This raises the difficulty of estimating a grain growth rate and a corresponding activation energy from grain size data in shallow ice, assuming a parabolic grain growth law.</p><p>[61] In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> we compare the data to different simulated profiles down to 2135 m. Note that all these simulations include the effects of temperature changes. Not surprisingly, the effect of bubbles and clathrates pinning shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10a</ref> cannot explain the strong decreases of hRi with climatic transitions. However, as R approaches R Z within deep ice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9a</ref>), clathrate pinning results in a limited grain size decrease observed at termination II. The simulated profiles shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> have been obtained with a low-mobility hypothesis for the clathrates. The extreme opposite situation (i.e., very high clathrate mobility)   is unlikely, as it would result into a very large overestimation of the grain sizes below 1200 m (not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Pinning of Grain Boundaries by Microparticles</head><p>[62] As discussed in section 2.3.2 the pinning effect of microparticles on GB can be quantified from the number N d of particles per unit volume and their distribution of size which are known from Coulter counter measurements (section 3.2.1). Following the discussion of section 3.2.2, we first consider that all the particles are located along GB (possible unpinning of GB from particles is neglected at this stage). Consequently, the limiting grain size associated with the dust particles, R Z d , is expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R Zd ¼ 3a phr d iN d 1 2<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>where hr d i is the average size of dust particles. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref>, the evolution of R Z d deduced from the dust record with a = 0.25 is plotted. Note that we were unable to calculate R Z d precisely for each measured value of hRi, as grain size and dust content were not sampled exactly at the same depths. Nevertheless, the evolutions of hRi and R Z d strongly suggest a major role of particles pinning on grain growth in polar ice. During interglacial periods such as the Holocene, the dust particle density is too low to have a strong effect on grain growth, as illustrated by R Z d values much larger than hRi. During glacial maxima (i.e., stage 2.2, 4.2 and 6.2), at depths where the dust concentration is particularly high, the agreement between R Z d and hRi is striking: the grain size has reached the limiting size imposed by particles pinning. This is in agreement with previous studies made on other ice cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Fisher and Koerner, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gow et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jun et al., 1998</ref>].</p><p>[63] It is worth noting that if particles were located randomly within the volume, the R Z d values would be much larger than the observed grain sizes, even for the largest continental dust concentrations measured along the core (e.g., R Z d around 500 mm at a depth of 500 m). This led <ref type="bibr">Alley et al. [1986b]</ref> to conclude that particles pinning could not significantly affect grain growth. We note however that observed grain sizes hRi are slightly larger than R Z d for stage 6.2 (around 1750 m). As discussed in section 2.3.2, this might be explained by partial unpinning of GB from particles for deep, old ice.</p><p>[64] This mechanism is also in agreement with other observations:</p><p>[65] 1. As detailed in section 2.3.2, Zener pinning narrows the normalized distribution of grain sizes and modifies the mean. This is in full agreement with the profiles shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>. No other mechanism could easily explain these modifications of the distribution. Moreover, the microstructures observed for volcanic ash layers (black dots in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) show the same trends as ice containing a large amount of continental dust: small grain sizes, narrow normalized distributions and smaller mean. The pinning effect of particles is the same whatever their origin, aeolian or volcanic ash <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Gow and Williamson, 1976]</ref>.</p><p>[66] 2. Despite a significant decrease of temperature, ACR was characterized by a limited increase of the dust content <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Delmonte et al., 2002]</ref>. As the pinning effect of particles on grain growth is strongly non linear, the limiting grain size values R Z d are very similar during ACR and Holocene. Consequently, the dust particles density is too low to have a strong effect on grain growth. This explains why the ACR is not revealed by the grain size profile. On the other hand, the well-marked decrease of grain size observed at the stage 3.3 to stage 4.2 transition is easily explained by a simultaneous large change of dust amount.</p><p>[67] 3. More evidence comes from continuous grain size analyses. A good example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref> shows the grain size profile from 339.35 m to 339.65 m, corresponding to an age of about 11200 BP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12a</ref>), along with the corresponding profiles for the dust content (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12b</ref>) and for SO 4 2À <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[Traversi et al., 2002]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12c</ref>). Between 339.45 and 339.55 m, a layer of very small grain size is observed. This layer is linked to large values of the dust content resulting from volcanic deposition. Such observations are reported for other sites (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gow and Williamson [1976]</ref> for the Byrd core).</p><p>[68] The volcanic origin of the dust is attested by a larger average particle size compared to continental dust. On the contrary, small grain sizes are not related to any remarkable features of the soluble impurity records. As an example, larger values of SO 4 2À are observed 7 cm above the small grain layer, that is, about 2 years later (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12c</ref>). This observation can be explained by a deposition of sulfates few years after the eruption as a result of a stratospheric pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Herron, 1982]</ref>, whereas ashes deposition closely follows the eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[Legrand and Delmas, 1987]</ref>. We have verified with another continuous grain size analysis performed between 389.0 and 389.6 m that concentrations of sulfates up to 700 mgl À1 (at 389.45 m), do not affect grain growth.</p><p>[69] Adding the effect of all the pinning objects (bubbles, clathrates and dust particles), our model is able to accurately reproduce the observed profile down to about 60 kyr ($1000 m), in terms of its general trend as well as local fluctuations (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10c</ref>). However, below 1000 m, we observed two problems: (1) the simulation overestimates hRi down to termination III at 1750 m, but (2) it underestimates hRi below. Observation 1 can be explained by the effect of rotation recrystallization, as shown by our model. The model results also suggest a new process in polar ice: the unpinning of dust particles which could explain observation 2. These points are detailed in sections 5.6 and 5.7, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.">Other Recrystallization Processes</head><p>[70] As briefly discussed in the introduction, deformationinduced recrystallization mechanisms modify the polar ice microstructure. Migration recrystallization is unlikely to occur along the EPICA Dome C ice core in the depth range analyzed here (100-2200 m), as the temperatures are much lower than À10°C. Data shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> clearly demonstrate that rotation recrystallization is unable to fully balance normal grain growth. In this respect, the EPICA Dome C ice core differs from the Greenland ice cores (GRIP, GISP2) or the Byrd ice core, but resembles the Vostok ice core. This, however, does not mean that rotation recrystallization does not occur. The most efficient way to detect rotation recrystallization is based on the correlation of c axes orientation between neighboring grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[Wilen et al., 2003]</ref>. This analysis requires detailed crystallographic data that are not yet available for the EPICA ice core. However, rotation recrystallization could be revealed from the microstructure through a modification of the distribution of the angles between GB at triple junctions (on 2D sections) <ref type="bibr">[Weygand, 1998]</ref>. Without rotation recrystalliza-tion, this distribution is strongly centered around 120°. Rotation recrystallization increases the standard deviation of the distribution of angles, s q . A significant increase of about 4°of s q has been observed on the EPICA Dome C ice core within the depth range 800-1500 m (not shown). This can be attributed to the onset of rotation recrystallization, although the flattening of the grains with increasing deformation may partly explain this observation.</p><p>[71] The implementation of the rotation recrystallization process into the model followed the dislocation densitybased modeling framework proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Montagnat and Duval [2000]</ref>. It is worth noting that this implementation does not introduce any additional adjustable parameters, as the parameters are set to the value proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Montagnat and Duval [2000]</ref> on the GRIP ice core. The model calculates the depth at which the rotation recrystallization appears, z c , as well as r c , the dislocation density at z c (see section 2.4 and <ref type="bibr">Durand [2004]</ref>).</p><p>[72] The model indicates that the rotation recrystallization appears at a depth z c = 610 m and a dislocation density r c = 1.9 Â 10 11 m À2 . Recrystallized layers are intercalated between not recrystallized layers within the depth range 610-700 m. Note that the impact of the rotation recrystallization on the grain growth rate is very small within this depth range. Below 700 m, all the layers have reached their r c ($1.1 Â 10 11 m À2 at 700 m); that is, rotation recrystallization is occurring whatever z between 700 and 2135 m. This is in agreement with the standard deviation of the triple junction angles, sq, which increases from about 800 m (data not shown). The dislocation densities r calculated with our model (5 Â 10 10 m À2 r 2 Â 10 11 m À2 ), are in agreement with the estimation of De La Chapelle et al. <ref type="bibr">[1998]</ref> for the Vostok ice core (r $ 1.3 Â 10 11 m À2 at a depth of 1000 m).</p><p>[73] We compared two different simulated profiles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>), with and without taking the rotation recrystallization into account (the profile without rotation recrystallization was already shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10c</ref>). Although the rotation recrystallization is not strong enough to balance the normal grain growth, it significantly decreases the grain size in the depth range 1000-1750 m. On the other hand, the rotation recrystallization does not significantly decrease R over the depths where R is closed to R Z (stages 4.2 and 6.2). In that case the complex combination of different feedbacks between pinning and rotation recrystallization effects leads to a rapid growth of grains after their subdivision. In other words, the grain size decrease induced by rotation recrystallization is quickly balanced by a rapid grain growth allowed by the relaxation of the pinning pressure P Z (indeed, the new boundaries are not pinned). Therefore R reaches quickly its previous value near R Z .</p><p>[74] The quantitative agreement between the profile simulated with rotation recrystallization and the data down to 1750 m is particularly striking, as the rotation recrystallization process does not introduce any adjustable parameter into the model. The comparison of the present case with the GRIP core is enlightening. For the GRIP core, the strain rates are much larger. This induces larger recrystallization rates which are able to balance normal grain growth over the range 500 -1500 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[Thorsteinsson et al., 1997]</ref>. This recrystallization rate can be expressed as the time needed to subdivide each grain into two parts. Castelnau et al. 2À concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[Traversi et al., 2002]</ref>.</p><p>[1996] estimated this time to be about 2000 years for the GRIP core whereas we obtained much larger values between 12,000 and 20,000 years for the Dome C ice core.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7.">Unpinning</head><p>[75] As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>, the present model, taking into account the evolution of temperature, the pinning effect of dust particles, bubbles and clathrates, as well as the rotation recrystallization, can accurately reproduce the measurements down to 1750 m. Below this depth, the model significantly underestimates hRi. We have shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">11</ref> that the predicted limiting grain size induced by the dust particles R Z d is smaller than hRi within the depth range 1750-2000 m. To remove this paradox, an additional process has to be introduced, namely the unpinning of grain boundaries from the dust particles. So far, we neglected this process, assuming that a pinned microstructure was frozen in its evolution. However, observations performed on the Vostok ice core and shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> indicate that the proportion of bubbles and clathrates located along the grain boundaries decreased with increasing depth. This can be explained only by an unpinning of GB from bubbles and clathrates. This unpinning of GB from bubbles and clathrates is already taken into account in the model through the evolution of the location of these objects summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. Such observations are not available for the dust particles.</p><p>[76] Here, we follow equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>), initially proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gore et al. [1989]</ref>, to model unpinning from dust particles. We recall that initially p ran = 0 and p gb = 1. The value of n 0 and E U in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">7</ref>) are totally unknown for ice. Therefore we chose to set E U to the self-diffusion energy, E U = 59.8 kJ.mol À1 .</p><p>[77] Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref> compares the measured evolution of hRi with two simulations, (1) without unpinning (i.e., the profile shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) with unpinning of GB from dust particles with n 0 = 4 Â 10 8 yr À1 . The agreement is surprisingly good, as unpinning starts to significantly affect R only from the depth of 1750 m where the previous simulation failed. This suggest that unpinning indeed takes place within polar ice, owing to the very large timescales involved. However, much work remains to be done in order to properly quantify this process. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref> we also plot the evolution of p gb with depth. For the LGM ice, p gb is very close to 1, in agreement with the X-ray tomography analysis detailed in section 3.2.2. This proportion falls to almost 0 below 2000 m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>[78] The grain growth process in cold ice sheets and the effects of impurities have been analyzed on the basis of a detailed study of the microstructure of the Dome Concordia EPICA ice core, in relation with impurity contents (dust and soluble impurities). We reviewed the possible different mechanisms that could explain the correlation between grain size and surface temperature. A memory effect of the surface temperature at the time of deposition or the drag of soluble impurities have been eliminated on the basis of different observations including grain size distribution profiles or continuous grain size analyses. Then, we developed a model that takes into account normal grain growth and rotation recrystallization, as well as the pinning effect of dust particles, bubbles and clathrates. As these recrystallization processes depend on temperature, the evolution of temperature with depth and climate is also taken into account. In the absence of migration recrystallization, normal grain growth is the only mechanism that increases the grain size with time. This increase is counteracted by pinning of grain boundaries on bubbles, clathrates and dust particles, as well as by rotation recrystallization. The relative contributions of these processes acting against normal grain growth are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>. Partial  unpinning of GB from dust particles has also been introduced as a slow thermally activated process.</p><p>[79] Our model confirms that the surface temperature changes cannot explain the large grain size decreases observed during glacial to interglacial transitions, in agreement with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Duval and Lorius, 1980]</ref>.</p><p>[80] Bubbles and clathrates may explain why an exponent m larger than the theoretical lower bound of 2 (equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3)) is observed for grain growth within shallow ice corresponding to Holocene, and could also account for a fraction of the grain size changes observed at climatic transitions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>). However, the grain size decreases associated with glacial periods are mainly the result of pinning by dust particles located along GB. Indeed, a X-ray tomography of a LGM ice sample allowed us to locate the largest dust particles which were found to be concentrated along GB. Their pinning effect is therefore much stronger than it would be for a random distribution of particles within the volume. Therefore grain size cannot be considered as a true paleothermometer, but reflects in a complex non linear way of evolution of the dust content, which itself is related to climate changes.</p><p>[81] We showed also that clathrates have a significant effect on the grain size in deep ice, and their relative contribution to the restraining force is maximum when the dust content is low (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>). The pinning effect of clathrates cannot be neglected, as the model would overestimate the grain size within these depth ranges if the corresponding pinning force is not taken into account. Taking into account normal grain growth and pinning, the model is able to accurately reproduce the observed grain size profile down to 1000 m (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>).</p><p>[82] As previously shown on other ice cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[Thorsteinsson et al., 1997]</ref>, rotation recrystallization, which subdivides the grains, counteracts normal grain growth. In Greenland ice core (GRIP, GISP2), rotation recrystallization is strong enough to balance normal grain growth, whereas this is obviously not the case for the Dome C ice core. We estimated the effect of the rotation recrystallization on the average grain size from a modeling framework developed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[De La Chapelle et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Montagnat and Duval, 2000]</ref>. For the present ice core, the model predicts the onset of the rotation recrystallization at a depth z c around 610 m (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>). The effect of rotation recrystallization is particularly strong for layers with a low dust content and thus a grain size far from the critical radius (R/R Z 0.7; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">15</ref>). If rotation recrystallization does not fully balance normal grain growth in the present case, it is strong enough to balance the overestimation of R observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>. Taking into account rotation recrystallization, our model is able to accurately reproduce the grain size measurements down to 1750 m.</p><p>[83] To explain the underestimation of the modeled grain size below 1750 m, we introduced a slow thermally activated unpinning of GB from dust particles, following a theoretical analysis developed for ferrous alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Gore et al., 1989]</ref>. This allowed to accurately model grain size evolution over the entire depth range 100 -2135 m. This unpinning process implies that below 2000 m GB unpinned from most of the particles. However, this analysis of GB unpinning in polar ice remains very preliminary.</p><p>[84] Although this analysis is mainly based on a study of the Dome Concordia ice core, the conclusion is certainly relevant for other ice cores within central Antarctica (e.g., the ''old'' Dome C, Vostok.) that are characterized, as Dome Concordia, by very low surface temperatures and low accumulation rates. On the other hand, the story could be different in places like Greenland. Higher temperatures may change the effectiveness of soluble impurity drag, increase the rate of unpinning and consequently the proportion of dust particles randomly distributed. Finally, the larger accumulation rates imply that the first climatic transition (LGM/Holocene) is observed at depths where other recrystallization processes (induced by viscoplastic deformation, such as rotation recrystallization or migration recrystallization) take place and modify the microstructure. To answer these questions, more detailed analyses of Greenland ice microstructures is required, at a higher sampling frequency, along with X-ray tomography to locate the particles.</p><p>[85] Although the average grain size cannot be considered as a true paleothermometer, to understand its evolution with depth and time is of great interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cuffey et al. [2000]</ref> argued that the stain rate of the ice could depend on the grain size. As ice core dating is based on an ice flow model, understanding the deformation history of an ice layer and the possible relations with its microstructure are of primary importance to obtain correct climatic interpretations.</p></div>
