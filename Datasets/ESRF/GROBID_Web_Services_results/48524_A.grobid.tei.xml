<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The major goal of this project was the X-ray structure determination of the Tsp protein CT441 from C. trachomatis. For our experiments at the ESRF beamline ID29 we used crystals of TspCt S455A labeled with selenomethionine (SeMet). In total we evaluated diffraction properties of 44 crystals and collected data on four different crystals:</p><p>1. On crystal FK1_3 we were able to collect one dataset (894 images) at a standard wavelength and one dataset (3600 images) at 9.69keV (Zn), both to a resolutions of 3.5 Å.</p><p>2. Diffraction data (2000 images) of the SeMet containing crystal FK1_7 was collected at 12.7 keV resulting in a resolution of 4.01 Å.</p><p>3. On the crystal FK5_4 we collected one full dataset (3600 images) at Se peak-wavelength (12.6613 keV) with a resolution of 3.28 Å and an additional full dataset (3600 images) at Se inflection-wavelength (12.6574 keV) with a final resolution of 3.2 Å. 4. For the crystal FK8_1 we collected one full dataset (3600 images) at Se peak-wavelength (12.6613 keV) with a resolution of 3.26 Å, a full dataset (3600 images ) at Se inflection-wavelength (12.6574 keV) with a resolution of 3.18 Å and finally a full dataset (3366 images) at Se remote-wavelength (12.6903 keV) with a resolution of 3.27 Å.</p><p>MAD data collected from crystal FK5_4 was indexed (Mosflm, XDS) and scaled (Scala)resulted resulting in final resolution of approx. 3.5-3.8 Å. Unfortunately, we were unable to determine suitable phases for structure solution. This is likely caused by the weak anomalous signal which was detected and the limited resolution of the collected data. Although, it was not possible to detemine the structure of CT441 the results obatined from ESRF enabled us to subsequently improve the crystallization conditions and cryo-protocol to optimize diffration properties of our CT441 crystals. Structure determination is in progress.</p></div>		</body>
