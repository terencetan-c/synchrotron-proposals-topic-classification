<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head><p>Fourteen samples were analyzed during the experiment under different thermal cycles. The heating and cooling programs of the later samples were selected based on the premilinary data analysis of the previous ones. For the high temperature experiments, the powders were contained in borosilicate glass capillaries with 1 mm in diameter prepared under helium atmosphere to avoid the oxidation, the heating was provided by hot air blower.</p><p>High resolution X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from synchrotron radiations have precisely shown the peak positions of different HMS compounds, as well as small amounts of present impurities, usually hindered by the high background of conventional X-ray instruments due to the existence of manganese. An example is given at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, showing the major phase of HMS and a tiny peak of Si (estimated to be less than 1 at.-%). It is noticed that no significant chemical decompositions are observed over the whole temperature range. Le Bail refinements were performed by fitting the experimental patterns with the theoretical ones of the sublattices of manganese and silicon to obtain the cell parameters and the ratios c Mn /c Si of these sublattices. These ratios help to predict the compositions of different HMS compounds. The stoichiometry is identified to correspond to Mn 15 Si 26 at room temperature for all the investigated samples. The manganese and silicon subcells are expanded with increasing temperatures due to thermal agitations at atomic levels with different magnitudes, leading to the change in c Mn /c Si ratios. The modifications depend on the nominal compositions of the materials. Generally, this ratio increases with elevated temperatures up to a saturated value of approximately 1.736, then decrease with further heating for the samples containing only manganese and silicon, as illustrated at Fig. 2 for the sample with nominal composition of MnSi 1.75 . Figure 2: Temperature dependence of γ (MnSi γ ) obtained from profile matching of the synchrotron patterns with the sublattices of manganese and silicon for the sample with nominal compostions of MnSi 1.75</p><p>The saturation temperatures are less than 700ºC for all the samples and decrease with increasing of silicon amount. Unfortunately, the cooling cycle have shown poor reproducibility of these ratios; the reasons are suggested to be either the presence of impurities (manganese monosilicide MnSi or silicon), or the irreversibility of the transformation. The phase transitions are predicted to happen after the saturation points due to intolerant disturbance of the structures at high temperature.</p><p>Due to the limited time for experiments, the doped samples were either measured only at room temperature or heated up to less than 700ºC. Germanium, aluminum, and chromium appeared to be inserted into the structure of HMS, while molybdenum disilicide MoSi 2 is identified as impurity due to the large size  </p></div>

The band gap and density of states near the Fermi level, which are responsible for thermoelectric properties of HMS, depend on their actual compositions. Unfortunately, the precise stoichiometry was rarely identified in previous reports due to the lack of clear evidences from lab-scale characterization methods. The experiments at ESRF were performed in order to help us to indicate the compositional ratios (γ) of different HMS-based materials together with various dopants and understand their structural evolutions at elevated temperatures.</figDesc></figure>

At room temperature, the predicted composition for Ge-doped HMS was Mn 11 Si 19 , and for the others -still Mn 15 Si 26 . The evolution with the temperature have shown clear dependence on the doping types. In the cases of germanium (Fig.3 a) and chromium dopants, the ratio increases with the temperature growth, but do not reach the saturation point in the temperature range. On the other hand, the Al-doped HMS (Fig.3 b) have shown a trend to decrease this ratio with temperature growth.</figDesc></figure>
