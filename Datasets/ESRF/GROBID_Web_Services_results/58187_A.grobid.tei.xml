<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the proposal was to investigate the oxidation kinetics of CuS, ZnS and CdS during reaction with ozone as well as the speciation of Cu, Zn and Cd in wastewater effluent after ozonation.</p><p>Qualitative comparison of experimental XANES spectra of effluent water that was treated with ozone suggested that Zn was primarily sorbed to iron(hydr)oxides, and Cu was probably complexed to organic material. Due to the low Zn and Cu concentrations in the effluent water, the spectra however were of limited quality and could not be investigated in more detail. We therefore decided to investigate the transformation of CuO and ZnO-NP reacted with bisulfide (HS -) over time instead. The compiled results from the CuO NP study are summarized in a manuscript that will be submitted to Environmental Science Nano shortly. A brief summary of the background and the results of the measurements performed at ESRF is provided below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>In addition to their use in the fields of catalysis, electronics and energy, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are increasingly used in a variety of biocide applications, such as wood preservation, anti-fouling coatings and agricultural pesticides <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kiaune and Singhasemanon 2011)</ref>. CuO NPs from these specific applications and ZnO-NP mainly from personal care products may be released to the wastewater stream and transported to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The sulfidation of chalcophile elements, such as Cu and Zn, favored by the elevated concentration of bisulfide (HS -) in wastewater systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Liu, Pennell et al. 2011)</ref>, will strongly influence the speciation and the bioavailability of these elements in (treated) wastewater and in the sewage sludge. In previous studies, only the endpoints of the reaction were investigated, leaving the reaction kinetics and mechanisms largely unexplored. For an exposure assessment of biota to CuO/ZnO NP, however, the transformation rates of these NP in different (waste)water systems are essential and have to be related to typical residence times in the respective systems. In this study, we, therefore, investigated the sulfidation of CuO-and ZnO-NP, in the presence of HS -in aerated solutions buffered to pH 8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures and results</head><p>Based on prior knowledge derived from TEM analyses and laboratory experiments to assess the sulfidation rates of CuO, we conducted additional time-resolved CuO-NP sulfidation experiments designed to enable the analysis of the solid phase by XAS. CuO NP (1.3 mM, 50 nm) were reacted with HS -(4.2 mM) for up to 2 days. At selected time points, samples were collected by directly pipetting the reacting suspensions into liquid nitrogen cooled samples holders. The reaction progress monitored by determining the speciation of Cu using Cu K-edge XAS. The recorded XANES spectra and the corresponding LCF results are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and 2A, respectively. XANES spectra showed a steady decrease of an oscillation at 8997 eV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, dashed line), a typical feature of CuO. The spectra became considerably flatter during the first 15 minutes and strongly resembled the spectrum of amorphous Cu x S. Over time, a shoulder gradually appeared at 8985 eV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, dotted line), which is characteristic for crystalline CuS (covellite). After 3 d the experimental spectrum was very similar to the reference spectrum of covellite. The evolution of the XANES spectra thus suggests an initial transformation of CuO to amorphous Cu x S and ultimately to covellite, consistent with XAS results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Pattrick et al. (1997)</ref> for the reaction of dissolved Cu 2+ with bisulfide. LCF analysis of the XANES spectra supported the qualitative interpretation of the spectral sequence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The XAS-based results are supported and complemented by TEM images revealing distinct morphological and chemical changes of the nanoparticles over time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>): Aggregates of ~40 nm CuO primary particles, representing the crystalline starting material, initially transformed into Cu x S particles of comparable size but with a fuzzy internal structure (HAADF), reflecting the fast conversion of crystalline CuO into amorphous Cu x S (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> at 5 min). The comparable size of the pristine and transformed primary particles and the similar morphology of their aggregates suggests that this transformation occurred via a direct solid-fluid reaction mechanism.   In a second set of time-resolved experiments, ZnO NP (1.2 mM, 50nm) were reacted with HS -(11.1 mM) in the absence or presence of 10, 100 and 1000 ppm humic acid for up to 10 days and the reaction progress was monitored by determining the Zn speciation using Zn K-edge XAS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> A and B). The sulfidation occurred in two distinct phases: a very fast initial reaction of ZnO to ZnS was followed by a much slower reaction, which was complete after 10 days (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). In the presence of HA higher reaction rates were observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). TEM analyses indicated the formation of core-shell structures which developed into hollow ZnS spheres over time. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental implications</head><p>Experimentally determined sulfidation halflife times were between a few seconds and several minutes and typical hydraulic residence times in wastewater systems range from 24 h up to several days. Thus, CuO NP will be completely sulfidized in wastewater systems. LCF analyses of XAS spectra revealed much higher sulfidation rates of ZnO-NP in the presence of HA, in agreement with previous results reported for the sulfidation of silver-NP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Thalmann, Voegelin et al. 2016)</ref>. The XAS data acquired in this study complemented by TEM analyses revealed different sulfidation rates and mechanisms for CuO-and ZnO-NP, which have to be taken into consideration when assessing the impact of these NP on environmental and engineered systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1: Normalized XANES spectra of the references used for the LCF analysis and experimental spectra collected at increasing reaction times (solid black lines).
