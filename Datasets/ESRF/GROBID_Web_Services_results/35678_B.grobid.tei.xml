<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Holliday junctions (fourway junctions) are universal intermediates in repair and reorganization of DNA by homologous recombination. They are mobile links between two homologous DNA duplexes and generate new segments of heteroduplex DNA by branchmigration. A crucial step is the final resolution of the junction without loss of nucleotides. Holliday junctionresolving enzymes mediate the termination process by recognizing DNA fourway junctions and introducing symmetrical nicks. Members of this ubiquitous family of structurespecific endonucleases function as dimers and require divalent cations for cleavage. We have solved the crystal structures of cruciform cutting enzyme 1 (CCE1) from Candida glabrata (341 aa, 39kDa) and Holliday junction cutting enzyme (Hjc) from the hyperthermophile archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (136 aa, 15.5kDa) at 2.8 and 1.7Å resolution, respectively. They represent two structurally distinct resolvase families with the same biological function, but exhibiting clearly different substrate specificities. Recently, we have solved the complex of Hjc with a synthetic junction at 3.3Å resolution.</p><p>2. All the proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3), Bl21(DE3)pLysS, CodonPlus RIL, Rosetta) as protease cleavable fusions with solubility/affinity tags using standard technics. Neither Hjc nor Cce1 present any biological risk. All data collection at ESRF were done 100K. Crystals and datasets: a) Hjc wild type (data collected on 27.02.07, ID143):</p><p>1.7Å resolution, SG=P3 2 21, cell parameters: a=37.56Å c=272.47Å, 2 mol./ASU b) Hjc K90A+K91A surface mutants (data collected on 30.06.07, ID231):</p><p>1.55Å resolution, SG=P2 1 , cell parameters: a=57.50Å b=75.48Å c=60.92, β =115.34°, 4 mol./ASU c) Cce1 ammonium sulfate based condition (data collected on 27.02.07, ID143): 2.8Å resolution, SG=I4 1 22, cell parameters: a=206.22Å c=87.11Å, 2 mol./ASU d) Hjcjunction complex (data collected on 30.06.07, ID231): 3.3Å resolution, SG=P6 2 22, cell parameters: a=123.18Å b=125.15Å ab) are refined structures, c) is partially built, the modelling of d) is in progress.</p><p>3. For the next BAG we would probably need 3 shifts on undulator beam lines, due to the weak diffraction of our DNAprotein complex crystals. No special technics would be involved, only cryocooling is a requirement for our projects.</p><p>4. We expect to improve resolution of partially built resolvase (Cce1) structures in order to reach publication quality. The crystallization of various resolvase/Hollidayjunction complexes is under way. These complex structures might allow us to better understand the molecular mechanism of the last step of homologous recombination: the resolution of the Holliday junction. However, the notoriously weak diffraction of such crystals necessitates the application of high brilliance synchrotron radiation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Biological impact</head><p>Glutathione (GSH) is an important cellular redox buffer which by dimerization helps the cell to cope with different external stress stimuli. Further GSH can posttranslationally modify proteins and serves as a major storage form of reduced sulfur. GCL catalyzes the first and ratelimiting step of GSH synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2a. Previous work</head><p>We described the structure of plant Arabidopsis thaliana GCL (Hothorn, JBC, 2006) and found an interesting new feature, which might serve as an additional activityregulating element that is not present in bacterial homologues. In the oxidized state a disulfide bridge fixes a bhairpin into a position, which allows free diffusion of substrates into the active site. A further disulfide bond is found near the dimer interface. We propose that the two disulfide bridges together allow a precise, redoxdependent regulcatio of the enzyme activity.</p><p>Structures of AtGCL with in vivo relevant ligands have been solved recently. The unpublished structure with ADP and ihbibitor shows that the nucleotide binds similar as it has been seen in the E.coli structure. Further the inhibitor, which mimics the reaction product and is very similar to GSH, suggested GSH as a feedback inhibitor.</p><p>The structure with the GSHanalog has been solved with data collected at ESRF at BM16.

Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the /NF/1 gene, which encodes the 320 kDa protein neurofibromin. Neurofibromin contains a central GAPrelated domain (GRD) that acts as a Rasspecific GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) and a Sec14PH module. previously characterized in our group. Although crystal structures of this central portion of the protein (20%) have been determined, 80% of the protein has yet to be analyzed functionally and structurally. To this respect, we have developed a protocol to produce full lenght human NF1 protein in insect cells. This recombinant protein is currently included in crystallization trials. beamtime: test case</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Characterization of activating Ras mutants involved in Costello syndrome</head><p>Ras proteins are small GTPases encoded by protooncogenes that are mutated in ~30% of human tumors. In addition, several studies show the presence of HRAS mutations in approximately 85% of individuals with Costello syndrome. Costello syndrome is a mental retardation syndrome characterized by high birth weight, postnatal growth retardation, coarse face, loose skin, cardiovascular problems and tumor predisposition. In this project, we have characterized a missense mutation in codon 117 (K117R). The HRAS K117R mutation results in constitutive activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway similar to the typical G12S and G12A mutations.</p><p>Recombinant HRAS K117R demonstrates normal intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and responsiveness to GTPaseactivating proteins, but the nucleotide dissociation rate is increased 80fold. To investigate the properties of the HRAS K117R mutant at a structural level, we determined the crystal structure of GDPbound HRAS K117R (published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Denayer et al., 2007)</ref>. The mutant protein was overexpressed in E. coli. For structure determination of the GDPbound K117R mutant, crystals were grown at room temperature by the vapor diffusion technique in hanging or sitting drops by mixing 1 l of protein (15 mg/ml in TrisHCl, MgCl2, DTT, glycerol, pH 7.6) and 1 l from a total reservoir (PEG3350, TrisHCl pH 7.6). A data set to 1.49 Å resolution was collected on beamline ID29 (with cryo) (22/09/06). The structure was solved and protein coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the PDB database with code number 2QUZ. Our data indicate an altered interaction pattern of the side chain that is associated with unfavorable nucleotide binding properties further supporting our biochemical data. In future, we will analyze additional Ras mutants also involved in Costello syndrome in a similar way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure determination of HIV CyclinT1TatTAR complex Background</head><p>The Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) is the causative agent of Aquired immune Deficiency Syndrome. Transcription of the HIVgenome requires the interaction of the viral transcription activator Tat, a transactivating response element (TAR) present at the 5' end of nascent viral transcripts.</p><p>Destroying the CyclinT1TatTAR interaction is thought to be of therapeutic impact in order to control AIDS pathogenesis. In this proposal we want to solve the structure of HIV Cyclin T1TatTAR complexes. Crystals of biologically active Cyclin T1TatTAR protein have been obtained, which diffracted to 3.3 A at ESRF ID231 beamline. Several experiment on different constructs have been done in order to optimize the crystal quality for better diffraction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results expected</head><p>We expect to collect the high resolution data at 3 rd generation synchrotron radiation source like SLS to solve the phase problem. In case the Molecular Replacement method doesn't work, we would like to collect the SeMet data of CyclinT1TatTAR complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimate and justification of the beamtime</head><p>Due to limitations of crystal diffraction, we have performed many different experiments (e.g. different constructs, cryoconditions, dehydration and soaking etc.) to optimize the better quality. As the optimal crystalsize is obtained in about 10 days and then they need about a week for dehydration experiment for few of the constructs, we would estimate at least 3 shifts with the gap of 23 weeks among each shift.</p></div>		</body>

Neurofibromatosis type I is a common inherited neurocutaneous disorder caused by alterations in the NF1 gene encoding the Ras specific GTPase activating protein (GAP) Neurofibromin.</p><p>Beside various other complications, the clinical manifestations include the formation of benign peripheral nerve sheet tumors called neurofibromas, which can progress to malignant forms.</p><p>Recently we could solve the structure of a neurofibromin module including a Sec14 and a pleckstrin homology (PH) -like domain in complex with lipid ligands. To further characterize the lipid binding properties of the Sec14like domain, we prepared protein bound to only one species of lipids. We prepared as well Sec14PH fragments modified to resemble missense mutations found in patients to identify functional important parts of the domain architecture and the lipid biding site by comparison with the unmodified structure. This information will guide further biochemical characterization, help us to identify cellular functions of the module and finally give new insights into the mode of action of the disease. </p></div>			</div>
