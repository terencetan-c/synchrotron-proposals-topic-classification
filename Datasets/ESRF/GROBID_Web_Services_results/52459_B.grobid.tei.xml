As such, this reaction is of great interst in the context of energy conversion. In recent years many details of the mechanism have been elucidated and a general schematic of the proposed mechanism is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The catalytic cycle begins with the active site in a diferric resting state, which is then reduced by two electrons to a diferrous state. The diferrous site then reacts with O 2 generating a (µperoxo)diferric species (called MMO-P) followed by a diiron(IV) species (MMO-Q), which is responsible for the hydroxylation of methane. The exact structure of Q, however, is hotly debated. Based on comparison to model studies, it is argued that MMO-Q may have either a closed diamond core conformation or an "open" core conformation, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Until now, however, spectroscopic data to validate one model over the other has not been available.</p><p>During our beam time, we were able to obtain high quality HERFD XAS data on the diferrous, diferric and MMO-Q intermediate. The later was particularly challenging because the rate of beam damage was so fast that the sample had to moved to a new spot every ~10 seconds. This required a significant amount of protein sample in order to obtain good statistics. Further, analysis of the data were complicated by the fact that the intermediate sample could only be obtained in 30-40% yields. This required parallel Mössbauer analysis, in order to subtract the other components, and obtain "pure" intermediate spectra. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the data we obtained after processing and subtraction based on Mössbauer analysis are consistent with an Fe(II)Fe(II), Fe(III)Fe(III) and Fe(IV)Fe(IV) series, in terms of both the pre-edge and rising edge.</p><p>In order to establish the spectral signatures for different oxygen binding modes in binuclear iron systems, we also obtained HERFD XAS data on a series of Fe dimers, provided by our collabroator Larry Que. These models provide essential data for establishing the exact structure of the MMO-Q core. As the synthesis and structure of these complexes are not yet published, we will provide furtehr details at a future date.</p><p>We are presently working on the correlation of these results to computations. Modeling the protein active site properly is a significant computational task and hence the analysis is taking sometime. Upon completeion of these correlations, we should be able to reliably assign the nature of the MMO-Q core. These data thus mark a very important step toward understanding the process of biological methane oxidation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Metrical parameters for the two competing MMO-Q structures.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,338.64,693.12,204.96,66.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
