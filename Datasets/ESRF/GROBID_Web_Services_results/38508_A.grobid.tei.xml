<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have encountered numerous technical difficulties during the experiments, as reported in the experimental feedback form sent beck just after the experiment. In particular, the exploitation of µXANES mapping have not been optimum and we finally had to focus on the ponctual analyses we performed during the second half of the session (about 320 spectra acquired manually, including doublons). However, the use of the µXANES method it-self at the iron K-edge on natural serpentine minerals, prepared on rock thin sections, was successfull, even for sample with low amount of iron (down to 1,4 wt% FeO). Because of the micrometric heterogeneity of natural rock samples, the selection of valuable spectra among the 320 we managed to acquire were fastudious and several spectra had to be removed because of local signal « pollution » by micrometric iron oxydes. But we finally gathered a pertinent set of data, that is still unique for natural samples. Data from the Rainbow site, initially central in this study, were not good enough but we got excellent data from 3 other oceanic sites in Atlantic (MARK, Ashadze, Lodgatchev) and one on land (Pindos ophiolite, Greece). The interpretation of data required additional analyses using other complementary techniques like whole rock chemical data by ICPMS, punctual analyses by electron microprobe, SEM imaging for phases quantification on thin sections. This has delayed our work because of the time necessary to get the required financement and then to realize the analyses. Financement of this project was obtained in summer 2009 thanks the CNRS PIE program (Programme Interdisciplinaire Energie : projet Hy-GEO 1 , principal investigator : M. Andreani).</p><p>A set of 23 analyses calibrated on 6 standarts have been selected and scientifically exploited. An example of 4 serpentine spectra from MARK site is given on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Each analysis is correlated to a peculiar location of the serpentine within the rock thin section and this is used to interpret the results in term of natural processes. In particular, serpentine analyses have been realized on rock samples that display various degree of alteration (i.e. serpentinization, see equation below) in order to correlate the evolution of Fe redox state and speciation with the reaction advancement and H 2 production. Using the method of Wilke et al. ( <ref type="formula">2001</ref>), we have calculated the Fe 3+ /Fe Tot ratio of the serpentine minerals and have estimated the amount of Fe 3+ in tethahedral sites thanks to the pre-edge centroid position and the integrated pre-edge area, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>The results show that Fe 3+ is abundant in serpentine formed at mid-ocean ridges and can represent up to 100% of the total iron in the structure. Most of the sample showing more than 60% of serpentinization tend to the general value of 62% of Fe 3+ , which is close to the one of magnetite (66%). Whole rock chemical analyses, in addition to petrographic and mineralogical characterization of the samples allowed us to establish that the evolution of Fe 3+ in serpentine with the degree of serpentinization, follows a power law whose curvature parameter depends on the amount of associated magnetite. Fe 3+ is more rapidly incorporated in serpentine mineral if magnetite is not present, and then tends to the value of 62% whatever the amount of iron in the mineral (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>This clearly demontrates the involvment of serpentine formation on the H 2 production (cf. reaction 1) and our general law can now be used to estimated it at various natural sites. We have estimated that at least 10% of the H 2 produced is related to serpentine (MARK samples) and that this value easily attain 30% (Pindos samples) or even 70% locally in some samples from Logatchev. Thus the evaluation of the natural production of H 2 during serpentinization is site-dependent and must now take into account the Fe(III) incorporated in serpentine and not only the one contained in magnetite. This also opens new perspective on the role of serpentine minerals on the redox state in subduction zones where the oceanic crust is recycled in the earth mantle.</p><p>From a crystallographic point of view, it is worth noting that the morpholgy of the serpentine XANES spectra evolves with the amount of Fe 3+ in the structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> : Fe 3+ increases from bottow to top in MARK  samples). This reveals an evolution of the local iron environment in the serpentine structure. Our present-day data do not show an obvious correlation between the tetrahedrally-coordinated Fe 3+ and the amount of total Fe or Fe 3+ . But XANES with pre-edge region study is not the most appropriate method to investigate such a question. Additional specific investigation (e.g. using EXAFS) are required to further our understanding on the local iron environment in variably oxidized serpentine minerals.</p><p>This work has been presented in an international congress and an article is in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>6 (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 + 8 H 2 O  3 (Mg,Fe) 3 (Si,Fe) 2 O 5 (OH) 4 + Mg(OH) 2 + Fe 3 O 4</figDesc></figure>
