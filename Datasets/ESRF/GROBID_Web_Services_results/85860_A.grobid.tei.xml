<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: 1. Background and aim of the experiments</head><p>Poly-/oligosaccharide-containing hybrid block copolymer BCP systems and their self-assembly properties represent a step forward towards new class of nanomaterials with sub-10 nm nanostructure sizes and with use of biobased carbohydrate sub-block for future advanced materials. Strong repulsions between natural saccharidic blocks and synthetic blocks, expressed by the Flory-Huggins parameter , enable reducing interdomain size of nano-organized morphologies to less than 20 nm. A variety of poly-/oligosaccharidescontaining BCP systems with sub-10 nm scale patterned morphologies (lamella, hexagonal cylinders, sphere), have been obtained and put to action in varies application from drug carrier nanoparticles to nanostructured thin films in transistor applications by the Borsali group. Targeted chemical modification to the interface between the BCP sub-blocks can trigger phase transitions with varying annealing (temperature, solvent vapor) conditions and enhance BCP self-assembly to obtain quasi-defect free nanostructures. These properties could be used in future materials for conducting BCP thin films with enhanced performance.</p><p>The objective of the GISAXS measurements done was to gain morphological information of the impressive library of carbohydrate based BCPs in hand for these experiments. Part of the material was designed with chemical modification (adding charge to the interface between BCP sub-blocks) possibly enabling the material to self-assemble in a long range manner on a surface. Part of the experiments were done to assess, the extent of order in BCP films modified with charge using two different methods, a) modifying the BCP with charge before film casting and b) after casting with reagent vapor. In addition, the GISAXS patterns obtained in our last GISAXS experiments shows the rang of q is so small that higher order peaks were not able to be observed, so we changed the distance between the camera and samples to get a larger q rang. During this experiment, we also performed in situ GISAXS measurement for carbohydrate-based BCP thin films at heating temperatures from room temperature up to 200 deg. C.</p><p>To confirm the hypothesis stated above, precise characterizations of the morphologies of the BCP thin films with GISAXS and imaging techniques is mandatory. In these GISAXS experiments, we aimed to study the effect of solvent vapor annealing, sub-block chemical modification and real-time morphological variation of newly synthesized hybrid BCP systems containing varying carbohydrate sub-blocks and synthetic blocks of polyisoprene (PI) and polystyrene (PS). designed for next-generation advanced materials (targeting nanolithography for example) through GISAXS analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiments</head><p>GISAXS measurements were conducted for BCP thin films with varying molecular weights on Si wafer. All BCP materials used contained an oligosaccharide sub-block (maltoheptaose (MH), cyclodextrin (CD)) and a synthetic sub-block (PI, PS). Before GISAXS measurements, BCP thin films were prepared by spin coating BCPs on cleaned Si wafers. The samples were solvent annealed at ambiant temperature with varying solvent composition of THF and H2O and time. GISAXS experiments used a photo energy of 16 keV. The distance between samples and camera was 1.9 m. GISAXS images were recorded at room temperature during 10-100 sec exposures on a CCD detector at incidence angles from 0.10° to 0.22°. For in situ GISAXS measurements, BCP thin films were placed on an integrated heating system. GISAXS images were recorded from room temperature up to 200 deg. C. with a step of 5 deg. C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Result and discussion</head><p>The GISAXS 2D images and reflection peaks for Qx are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>GISAXS studies confirmed the hypothesis of gaining BCP thin films with long range order using MH-(+, MeTFSI)-PI-(+, MeTFSI)-MH were charge is put between the interface separating the BCP sub-blocks. Comparison between chemically modified thin films a) before film casting and b) after casting with reagent vapor hinted towards longer ranged order for premodified BCP film (a) compared to after casting modification (b). We are now concentrating on more conclusive data analysis to determine the extent of order gained in the thin film geometry and BCP conformation within the films. These results will be published as part study related to High  Low N Carbohydrate-Elastomer BCP thin films with charge induced long range order. In situ GISAXS measurements disclose the phase behavior of carbohydrate-based BCPs when the temperature was increased from room temperature to 200 deg. C. The self-assembly of MH-b-PS and CD-b-PS was not observed from their GISAXS images during the in situ GISAXS measurements. This implies that thermal annealing is not effective for MH-b-PS and CD-b-PS. For comparing different annealing methods, we also checked the MH-b-PS sample annealed by microwave method at the same incident angle. Hexagonally closepacked cylindrical lattice pattern was observed in its GISAXS image. This provides us an important clue to find the driving force of microwave annealing method. What more, we recheck some MH-b-PS samples with optimized parameters (a larger q rang) of GISAXS measurement. Higher ordered peaks were not found in the large q direction, which implies that the degree of ordering of MH-b-PS samples is limited after solvent vapor annealing even for 24 hours. These important results will be submitted soon to Langmuir as research article entitled "Self-assembly of maltoheptaose-block-polystyrene: Thin Film GISAXS results".</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>. for ca. 25 nm thick pristine triblock MH-PI-MH and interface modified MH-(+)-PI-(+)-MH BCP thin films. They clearly demonstrate a drastic profile change as a result of BCP chemical modification with charge. The scattering peaks for MH-(+)-PI-(+)-MH thin film are very sharp and peak positions indicate lamella nanostructures with domain spacing as small as 8 nm for the MH-(+)-PI-(+)-MH BCP thin film. The long range order is clearly visualized in the AFM images with corresponding FFTs in Figure 1.</figDesc></figure>
