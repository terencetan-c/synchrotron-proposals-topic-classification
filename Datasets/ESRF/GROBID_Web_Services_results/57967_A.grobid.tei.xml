<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ammonium metal borohydrides</head><p>Ammonium borohydride, NH 4 BH 4 , has an extreme gravimetric (24.5 wt%) and volumetric (157.3 g H 2 /L) hydrogen content, similar to solid methane and is prepared in pure form in our lab. However, it is metastable at RT and decomposes in a strongly exothermic manner; hence it cannot store hydrogen reversibly. We have synthesized a series of novel compounds with the chemical compositions (NH 4 ) x M y (BH 4 ) x+y , M = Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Y, Gd, La that efficiently stabilize NH 4 BH 4 . The structures and thermal properties have been investigated. The results for M = K, Mg, Mn and Y are described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solid solutions of (NH 4 ) 1-x K x BH 4</head><p>Both NH 4 BH 4 and KBH 4 crystallize with symmetry Fm-3m. Solid solutions with compositions (NH 4 ) 1-</p><p>x K x BH 4 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1) are formed during ball milling of the mixtures NH 4 BH 4 -KBH 4 , i.e. upon applied pressure. Unit cell volumes extracted by Rietveld refinement at 250 K divided by number of formula units (Z) are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (left). The V/Z values are all slightly lower as compared to Vegard's law, in accord with that the structures are pressure-stabilized. V/Z values as a function of temperature is plotted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (right). NH 4 BH 4 decomposes at ~65 °C. At higher temperatures, NH 4 BH 4 is released from (NH 4 ) 1-x K x BH 4 and the V/Z values approaches the value for KBH 4 . Clearly, (NH 4 ) 1-x K x BH 4 is stabilized as compared to NH 4 BH 4 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>NH 4 M(BH 4 ) 3 and (NH 4 ) 2 M(BH 4 ) 4 , M = Mg, Mn Four new compounds, NH 4 M(BH 4 ) 3 and (NH 4 ) 2 M(BH 4 ) 4 , M = Mg, Mn, have been synthesized and the structures solved based on the SNBL PXD data. The magnesium and manganese compounds are isostructural, due to similar cation sizes. Furthermore, the structures of NH 4 M(BH 4 ) 3 and (NH 4 ) 2 M(BH 4 ) 4 are similar to Kanalogues of KM(BH 4 ) 3 and K 2 M(BH 4 ) 4 , however, with lower symmetry due to the tetrahedral configuration of NH 4 + as compared to the spherical configuration of K + . NH 4 Y(BH 4 ) 4 and (NH 4 ) 2 Y(BH 4 ) 5 Two structures of NH 4 Y(BH 4 ) 4 and (NH 4 ) 2 Y(BH 4 ) 5 have been solved in a monoclinic and an orthorhombic unit cell, respectively. The structure of NH 4 Y(BH 4 ) 4 consists of complex ions [Y(BH 4 ) 4 ]NH 4 , similar to [Y(BH 4 ) 4 ]K. On the other hand, compounds with the composition (M + ) 2 Y(BH 4 ) 5 are not reported, and (NH 4 ) 2 Y(BH 4 ) 5 is believed to be stabilized due to di-hydrogen contacts between H δ+ from NH 4 + and H δ-from BH 4 -.</p><p>The remaining structures are currently investigated. One high-impact paper is in preparation, summarizing the entire work on ammonium metal borohydrides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strontium borohydride ammonia borane</head><p>A new hyodrogen rich compound, Sr(BH 4 ) 2 (NH 3 BH 3 ) 2 has been synthesized in our lab. In-situ PXD data reveal two new polymorphs of the compunds, and both structures have been solved in a orthorhombic and a tetragonal unit cell, respectively. The BH 4 -ligands bridge between two Sr atoms in both structures making 2D layers of B and Sr, wheres the two NH 3 BH 3 ligands coordinate to Sr as terminal ligands, pointing between the layers. One paper is in preparation.</p><p>The high quality X-ray data obtained at SNBL has made it possible to solve a series of structures within the ammonium metal borohydride material class. This makes it possible to observe trends and correlations between crystal structures and properties.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (Left) Unit cell volumes extracted by Rietveld refinement at 250 K divided by number of formula units (Z) for (NH 4 ) 1-x K x BH 4 .
