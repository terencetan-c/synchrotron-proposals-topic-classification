<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The structure of Fe 4 N, otherwise known as the mineral roaldite, is face centered cubic with a nitrogen atom located in the center octahedral interstitial position. It is ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of about 760 K and carries an average magnetic moment of about 2.21 B per Fe atom. N binds to the interstitial positions of 3d metals essentially through the hybridization of the metalloid 2p states and the states in the 3d band of the host metal. This hybridization leads effectively to an increase of the metal's valence electron concentration e/a (electrons per atom). Substituting Mn [(e/a) = 7] in place of Fe in Fe 4 N [(e/a) = 8.75] reduces the electron concentration to 8.67 in (Fe 3.68 Mn 0.32 )N. This corresponds to a value where one finds the very interesting magnetic properties associated with strong magneto-volume instabilities in substitutional and interstitial 3d systems, namely the Invar properties. The Invar behavior is generally explained by an effect called "moment-volume instability," which means that the volume of the unit cell and the magnetic moment of its atoms are correlated, and thermal lattice expansions can be compensated for or increased if at the same time the magnetic moment of the atoms change with temperature. Fe 0.65 Ni 0.35 and Fe 3 C are the archetypes of substitutional and interstitial alloys respectively. (Fe 3.68 Mn 0.32 )N was prepared by the nitrogenation of Fe 1-x Mn x powder in a flowing atmosphere of hydrogen/ammonia at 480 o C. We have investigated the XMCD at the K-edge of Fe in this material at room temperature and pressures up to 20 GPa on increasing and decreasing pressure. The measurements were made at the ESRF on the ID24 beam line installed on an undulator source. The circular polarization was attained using a quarter wave plate. Two sets of measurements at each pressure with both polarization elipticities and both magnetic field directions were taken in order to eliminate systematic errors arising from the quarter wave plate and the magnetic field.

The XMCD spectra from ambient pressure up to 0.4 T was applied using an electromagnet, and a membrane type diamond anvil pressure cell was used in the experiments. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the XMCD spectra from ambient pressure up to 20 GPa. The shape of the XMCD spectrum at 0.5 GPa is consistent with the spectrum of Fe 4 N at same pressure obtained by Ishimatsu et al. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We observe a systematic weakening of the signal with increasing pressure, especially in the range 7.11 ≤ E ≤ 7.13 keV. The absolute value of the integrated XMCD obtained after subtracting the background intensity before and after the K-edge is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The intensity shows a gradual decrease with increasing pressure and, then, begins to decrease rapidly around 15 GPa. At about 20 GPa the intensity vanishes. The drop in the intensity is of similar character to that of Fe 4 N [3] as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The rapid decrease of the integrated XMCD indicates the possibility of the presence of a magnetovolume instability in (Fe 3.68 Mn 0.32 )N. However, in order to be conclisive it is necessary to investigate the temperature dependence of the lattice constant of (Fe 3.68 Mn 0.32 )N as well as the equation of state. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>ReferenceN.Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
