<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>The Thus, We would like to probe the structures of Comk alone, ComK_DNA complex and ComK_MecA_ClpCP complex to elucidate the structual information of this regulated proteolysis system. ComK as a transcription factor, not only induces the transcription of competence genes which encode the proteins necessary to form the DNA receptors but also interacts with MecA to the ClpCP protease for its degradation through a signaltransduction pathway, thereby regulating a key developmental process in Bacillus subtilis. Here we aim to understand how the transcription factor ComK interact with MecA and ClpCP and how this interaction results in ComK degradation. The data obtained by SAXS would then be combined with information obtained by NMR, SANS and EPR to generate a mechanistic information of the ComK degradation system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measured samples and results</head><p>For protein complexes, we measured in total four different kinds of complex: sample A: MecA121_ClpC-DWB, sample B: ComK_MecAFL_ClpC-DWB, sample C: MecA121_ClpC-ΔD2 and sample D: ComK_MecAFL_ClpC-ΔD2. Each protein complex, we measured in batch mode with four dilution points (12mg/ml, 5mg/ml, 2.5mg/ml, 1mg/ml). We also proceeded with the sample E: ComK_DNA complex at 2 different concentrations (0.9mg/ml, 0.45mg/ml) in batch mode. All measurements were performed at room temperature to make the data compatible with NMR data.</p><p>The data was analyzed using software from the ATSAS suite. Model free structural parameters such as I(0) and Rg have been extracted from the scattering intensity curves using PRIMUS software (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These parameters were used to build the distance distribution function P(r) using D max that satisfy smooth tailing in the large distances area. Ab initio modeling has been performed using as a first step DAMMIF software to find 10 best scoring models and then the average of these models was used as a searching volume for DAMMIF modeling to find 10 best scoring models.(Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).

So we still cannot build models for them based on what we get here. We need to further optimize their measuring conditions. So here we only shows the protein complex models we built for sample A, sample B and sample E (below).

Dr. Teresa Carlomagno: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER, Germany. 2) Ying Wang*: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER, Germany. 3)Vittoria Nanna*:Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER, Germany.Report: Samples from the proposal number MX-2255 were measured on 4 th and 5 th of November 2020. There were no technical problems with the beamline during the measurements.The regulated degradation system of the transcription factor ComK:A set of proteins encoded by late competence genes are responsible for the binding, processing and internalization of transforming DNA, and are present only in the competent subpopulation[1]. The transcription factor ComK is needed for the transcription of these genes, and is active and expressed only in the cells fated to become competent[2]. ComK also activates the transcription of genes needed for recombination and DNA repair[3]. ComK control is embedded in a complex signal transduction network: In exponentially growing B. subtilis cells, ComK is constantly antagonized by the adaptor protein MecA. MecA not only targets ComK for degradation by ClpCP, but also directly inhibits ComK activity. At higher cell density in post-exponential cells, signaling via a quorum sensing system causes the stable phosphorylation of the response regulator ComA, which results in the synthesis of the small protein ComS. ComS competes with ComK for binding to MecA, which results in the release of ComK from MecA mediated inhibition and degradation. Since ComK is a positive autoregulatory transcription factor, this release results in the exponential synthesis of ComK in the subpopulation of competence-developing B. subtilis cells. The MecA-dependent retargeting of the abundant ComK protein for ClpCP degradation is essential for the escape from competence[4].</figDesc></figure>
