<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A set of hexagonal BaTi 1-x Co x O 3-δ close-packed perovskites, with x=0.1-0.4 have been measured. Due to the large absorption coefficient provided by the A cation (A=Ba) at these energies, a preliminary study suggests the collection of the XAS spectra in the fluorescence yield mode.</p><p>In order to estimate the oxidation state of the B cations of such set of samples, X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements at the Co K-edge and the Ti K-edge have been performed in the Spanish CRG beamline (SpLine) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. XANES spectra have been collected in the fluorescence yield mode using a 13element Si(Li) detector. A Co foil and a Co 3 O 4 mesh have been used as reference. Several scans per sample have been measured in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Data treatment of the experimental XANES spectra has been performed with the ATHENA software. i Ti K-edge and Co K-edge XANES spectra are shown in the figure. The Ti K-edge XANES spectra do not exhibit any relevant modification in edge position and spectral shape, being the spectral shape similar to BaTiO 3 compounds measured in other works. ii,iii This confirms an oxidation state of Ti +4 in all the samples. On the other hand, Co K-edge XANES spectra of the BTCO samples present very slight differences in their spectral shape, as a very subtle decrease in the white line intensity can be observed. Compared to the BaCoO 3 XANES spectrum used as a reference, a negligible decrease of the pre-edge peak intensity have been observed as the Co content increases.</p><p>4960 4980 5000 5020 5040 0,0 0,5 1,0 1,5 Norm.

Results show no difference in the edge position for the whole set of BaTi 1-x Co x O 3-δ samples, with Co content between x=0.2 and x=0.4. Results are compared to the references and an oxidation state of ~+3.75 is then deduced, suggesting a combination of both Co +3 and Co +4 cations. However, samples with x=0.1, green-and black-BaTi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3-δ , exhibit a Co K-edge spectrum shifted to lower energies, which confirm the enhanced presence of Co +2 , apart from more important modifications in the XANES features. The remarkable decrease of the oxidation state in the Co cations of such samples, since Ti cations still present an oxidation state of +4, suggests that the green and black-BaTi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3-δ samples show a noticeable reduction in the oxygen content. In order to corroborate the relative content of Co cations in the BaTi 1-x Co x O 3-δ samples, the Co K-edges have been fitted considering contributions from each oxidation state by means of step functions, and Gaussians to reproduce the spectral features, coming from transitions to 4p states (and pd hybridized 3d states). Results are in total agreement with the estimated valence obtained from the edge positions.</p><p>7700 7720 7740 -0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 7710 7715 7720 0 1 2 3 4 1st derivative Energy (eV) Co Co 3 O 4 BaCoO 3 BaTi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3-δ green BaTi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3-δ black BaTi 0.6 Co 0.4 O 3-δ Black BaTi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3-δ δ δ δ Co 3 O 4 Co BaCoO 3 Green BaTi 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3-δ δ δ δ BaTi 1-x Co x O 3-δ δ δ δ Oxidation state Edge energy (eV) References Samples Linear fit</p><p>Two more considerations can be pointed. Firstly, it should be remarked that we obtained the first XANES spectra at the Ti K-edge energy range, lowering the up-to-now operation threshold of the BM25A beamline . Secondly, we would like to point that these results give very valuable information to interpret the physical properties of such hexagonal oxides, and at the present is under submission process in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal. Finally, full multiple scattering XANES calculations are under development (shown below), giving additional information included in a future short report.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><figDesc>C o2 real HL C o2 com plex DH C o1 real HL C o1 i B.
