Neuronal rat n-Sec1 has an arch-shaped threedomain structure, which binds syntaxin 1a through contacts in domains 1 and 3. In both rat nSec1 and homologous squid s-Sec1, a potential effector-molecule binding-pocket is shaped by residues from domains 1 and 2 and is localized on the opposite side of the syntaxin 1a interaction site. Comparison of several crystal forms of unliganded neuronal squid Sec1 indicates a hinge region between domains 1 and 2 which allows domain 1 to rotate along a central axis. This movement could release syntaxin 1a upon interaction with a yet unspecified Sec1 effector molecule(s). The binding of an effector protein may also directly affect the conformation of the helical hairpin of domain 3, which contributes the other significant syntaxin 1a binding sites in the rat nSec1/syntaxin 1a complex structure but adopts multiple conformations in the unliganded s-Sec1 structures reported here.</p><p>The structures have been solved by molecular replacement using data collected at beam lines ID14-1 (P2 1 , 2.8 Å) and ID13 (P3 1 21, 3.2 Å) in the previous data collection period (10/ 1999 to 8/2000) Publication: A.

Crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the neuronal t-SNARE syntaxin from squid.</p><p>(2) X-Ray crystal structure of the trimeric N-terminal domain of gephyrin Gephyrin is an ubiquitously expressed protein which, in the central nervous system, forms a submembraneous scaffold for anchoring inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. The N-and C-terminal domains of gephyrin are homologous to the E. coli enzymes MogA and MoeA, respectively, both of which are involved in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis. This enzymatic pathway is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals, as underlined by gehyrin's ability to rescue Moco deficiencies in different organisms. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 2-188) of rat gephyrin at 1.9 Å resolution. Gephyrin (2-188) forms trimers in solution, and a sequence motif thought to be involved in molybdopterin (MPT) binding is highly conserved between gephyrin and the E. coli protein. The atomic structure of gephyrin (2-188) resembles MogA, albeit with two major differences. The path of the C-terminal ends of gephyrin (2-188) indicates that the central and Cterminal domains, absent in this structure, should follow a similar three-fold arrangement as the the Nterminal region. In addition, a central β-hairpin loop found in MogA is lacking in gephyrin (2-188). Despite of these differences, both structures show a high degree of surface charge conservation, consistent with their common catalytic function.</p><p>The structure was solved by molecular replacement using data collected at ID14-2 to 1.9 Å.

Chem, 276, 25294-25301.</p><p>(3) Crystal structures of an oligomeric form of the matrix protein VP40 from Ebola virus.</p><p>The matrix protein VP40 from Ebola virus exists in a monomeric soluble conformation and a membranebound oligomeric form. Here we show that the N-terminal domain of VP40 adopts an octameric ring-like structure as detrermined from two different crystal forms belonging to space groups P422 and P6222. The oligomeric structures show considerable flexibility compared to the N-terminal domain of the monomeric structure of VP40 which might be important for the assembly process. In addition, the oligomeric structures suggest that part of the N-terminus which is ordered in the monomeric structure has to unfold and the Cterminal domain has to move out of the way to allow the oligomerization contacts observed in the octameric VP40 structures. This oligomeric form of VP40 may constitute a building block for virus assembly.</p><p>The crystal form belonging to spacegroup P422 was solved using a native dataset collected at ID14-2 (1.9 Å) and two MAD data sets collected from a platinum derivative. The hexagonal crystal form (collected at a previous data collection period <ref type="bibr">[12/1999]</ref>) was solved by molecular replacement using the model obtained by the tetragonal crystal form.</p><p>Manuscript in preparation: W.
