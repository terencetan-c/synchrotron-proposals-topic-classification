<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Unraveling the skills of glass-makers from Byzantine Cyprus through XANES spectroscopy of lab-prepared glass. Introduction:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>In the Roman and Byzantine period the glass production and distribution was well organised. Ancient glass makers did produce several hues ranging from yellow to green to blue. Besides the choice of raw materials, skilled glass-makers could also control the furnace redox conditions. Since glass colour is determined by colorant concentration and redox state, the redox control is a key parameter. The aim of this experiment was therefor to provide relevant information on glass production technology in a detailed historical and geographical context. For this purpose 22 historical glass samples, excavated from several Cypriot basilicas dated between the 4 th -7 th century A.D, were analysed. Additionally two series of lab-made glasses were succesfully analysed: one series with a fixed redox condition and varying Fe concentration (0.05 -0.80 wt %) and one with a fixed Fe concentration of 0.50 wt%, but varying redox conditions. Fe 3+ /ΣFe was determined by pre-edge analysis of the acquired XANES spectra. This is made possible since the centroid of the Fe-K pre-edge (1s → 3d transitions) is correlated to the average oxidation state, while the intensity gives information concerning the geometry. The centroid is defined as the energy position at which half of the total area of the pre-edge is integrated. A set of Fe(II) and Fe(III) minerals was measured as standards in order to create a calibration line for all unknown glass samples. The following references were measured: FeSO 4 .4H 2 O (chemical grade, +II), hercynite (mineral, +II), chromite (mineral, +II), magnetite (mineral, +II/+III), aegerine (mineral, +III), epidote (mineral, +III).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement/data:</head><p>A Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used, having an energy resolution of ΔE/E of about 10 -4 . A transmission XANES spectrum of a metallic Fe foil was recorded to provide an accurate energy calibration for all the recorded spectra; the first inflection point of the Fe-K edge was set to 7112 eV <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. All reference materials were measured in transmission and were mixed with PVC, with concentrations to obtain an edge jump of ~1.5-2. The thickness of all glass samples(historical and lab made) only allowed measurement in fluorescence with the sample oriented at 45° to the incoming beam and fluorescence yield was collected using a Vortex silicon drift detector at an angle of 45° with respect to the sample surface. Since bulk glass was measured an unfocused beam was used of which the size was only limited by using slits (horizontal:5 mm and vertical: 0.5mm). ROI fitting around the FeKa line (6113-6692 eV) was performed. XANES spectra were collected from ~270 eV below to ~460 eV above the Fe-K edge using different energy intervals; with a measuring time of 1-30 s/step resulting in a ~45 min measuring time per XANES spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and progress of evaluation:</head><p>XANES analysis: All acquired spectra, transmission and fluorescence, were normalised by means of the software package ATHENA. An edge-step normalisation was performed by a linear pre-edge subtraction and by regression of a (in general) third degree polynomial beyond the edge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The pre-edge is extracted using an arctangent function to describe the background, although different models are used in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>However the same mathematical model is used throughout the entire data set, to ensure consistent conclusions. This procedure is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Prior to the synchrotron experiment at DUBBLE, the glasses of the redox series were analysed by UV-vis-NIR transmission spectroscopy and XRF. Using the absorption of Fe 2+ and the total iron concentration we calculated the Fe 3+ /ΣFe (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>  The influence of the redox conditions on the XANES spectra of the reference glasses is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>The centroid of the Fe-K pre-edge (1s → 3d transitions) is correlated to the average oxidation state of iron. Therefore using the centroid positions of reference compounds we were able to set a calibration line (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Magnetite is excluded for the calibration line because it is known that in its Fe pre-edge there are also other transitions not linked to the oxidation state <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We applied this calibration values to compute the Fe 3+ /ΣFe of the redox glass series (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). There is a very good correlation between the points, except for AGCred4. The reason of this deviant behavior is under investigation. We suspect it might be linked to the homogeneity of the glass plate. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We calculated the Fe 3+ /ΣFe in 28 historical samples excavated in two different archaeological contexts. There are at least two groups of glasses: one melted under reducing condition (Fe 3+ /ΣFe = 0.4-0.6) and one group made under oxidizing conditions (Fe 3+ /ΣFe &gt; 0.9). In antiquity, glass industry was structured in a centralized model. Large primary factories, located near the raw materials produced glass which was then exported to secondary workshops. There, final objects were made. Although this is still under study, from the results of this experiment, we can conclude that a specific glass type corresponds to a peculiar redox value of iron. EXAFS analysis of the spectra is still in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Herman Terryn -Vrije Universiteit Brussel Dr. Simone Cagno -Norwegian University of Life Sciences/University of Antwerp * Prof. Koen Janssens -University of Antwerp Mr. Gert Nuyts -University of Antwerp* Mr. Andrea Ceglia -Vrije Universiteit Brussel* Report:</figDesc></figure>
