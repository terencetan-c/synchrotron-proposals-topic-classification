<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Lithium ion batteries are becoming increasingly energy dense, and consequently there is more heat and gas produced per unit volume upon failure than ever before. This presents an extreme challenge in mitigating the risks of thermal runaway and improving the safety of commercial cell designs. The purpose of this experiment was to link internal phenomena to external risks for a broad range of cell designs and safe matials. Thereafter, we aim to identify and resolve weaknesses in the designs of cells.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment, an in-situ calorimeter was designed to contain the blast of battery failure and measure the total heat emitted as well as the distribution of heat between ejected and non-ejected (from the cell casing) material. The calorimeter consisted of aluminium for X-ray transparancy and was encased in X-ray transparant insulation moulded inside a rigid case (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The ends of the calorimter were directly connected to the beamline ventilation to exhaust the smoke and fumes arising from thermal runaway of the cells.</p><p>From the calorimetry measurements we have determined that the majority of heat stems from ejected material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) -a previously unforeseen result, and one that is not considered in modelling and during the design of modules. We also observed that cells that incur sidewall breaches, on average, produce more heat than cells that don't.</p><p>During a sidewall breach, the steel casing melts or splits, releasing a dangerous flare (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) that can lead to propagation of thermal runaway from cell to cell inside a module. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> shows an example of a melt-hole that formed on the header of an 18650 cell -one of many observed during our testing. This is a highly unfavourable event and one that manufactures are keen to prevent.</p><p>From the high-speed radiographs, the cause of sidewall breaches could be determined. It was found that the breaches mostly occurred where molten ejecting material deflected off a surface. For example, at the spin-groove and on the base plate of commercial 18650 cells.</p><p>The unique high-speed imaging capability of the ESRF, specifically ID19 which has a highly coherent beam, allows such clear images as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> to be captured at &gt;2000 frames per second. Since, during thermal runaway, lithium ion batteries change from being entirely intact to entirely destroyed in about 1 second, such high-speed radiography is essential to characterise the fleeting stages that lead to catestrophic failure mechanisms.</p><p>We thank the ESRF and in particular, Alexander Rack, for allowing us to use their facilities and obtain such high impact results. We expect publications to arise from this work in the near future. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) (Right) Illustration of the in-situ calorimeter, and (left) photograph of the insulation case holding the calorimeter in ID19.
