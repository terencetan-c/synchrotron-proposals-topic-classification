<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>2H-NbSe2 was one of the first studied charge density wave (CDW) layered dichalcogenides. At ambient pressure the periodic CDW distortion is formed below TCDW = 33 K and superconductivity is found in this ordered state with an unusually high Tc = 7 K. The structure is composed of layers of one sheet of Nb atoms between two sheets of Se atoms Se-Nb-Se. Adjacent layers are bonded with weak van der Waals forces, which leads to a pronounced two-dimensional character, making this compound the archetypical case of superconductivity in layered materials. The particularity of this material is that the CDW and the superconducting state appear at very similar transition temperatures, causing a strong interaction between both states. The interplay between these two states was further exemplified by the evolution of both states with pressure, shown on Fig. 2 [1] . As TCDW decreases with pressure, Tc increases, showing that carriers from sections of the Fermi surface under the CDW gap are gradually released and made available for the superconducting state. However, recent measurements [2] of the Tc under pressure have given slightly but crucially different results, as the maximum of Tc is found beyond the previously reported disappearance of the CDW. It is vital for the understanding of the fundamental properties of this widely studied material to verify directly if the CDW distortion actually disappears at the pressure reported by Ref. 1 (3.7 GPa) or at the higher one that can implicitly be extracted from Ref. 2 (5 GPa).</p><p>The CDW distortion shows up as incommensurate superstructure reflections in the a*-b* plane of the hexagonal lattice. The reduced wave vector qCDW, representative of the Fermi surface nesting 2k F , is characterized by qCDW = 2/3 a* (1 -δ), with a small incommensurability δ ≈ 0.02 that shows a slight temperature dependence but remains incommensurate to low temperatures. The absence of a lock-in is an indication of a the strong role played by the Fermi surface. The evolution of 2k F with pressure can thus readily be studied by x-ray diffraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exprimental data and results</head><p>Small single crystals of NbSe 2 were mounted in a diamond anvil cell with 600 µm cutlet size and loaded with Ne as pressure transmiting media. The hydrostatic pressure was measured by fluorescence of a ruby chip. The cell was mounted in a He flow cryostat with an attached gas membrane for pressurizing the sample in-situ. Precise control of the temperature and pressure in the range of 10 K &lt; T &lt; 300 K and 0.2 GPa &lt; P &lt; 5GPa was employed. Diffraction data were acquired using a MAR CCD detector in the forward scattering direction</p></div>

The c* axis is naturally aligned to being close to parallel to the incoming beam, while the a* axis was chosen close to perpendicular to the φ rotation axis. In this way the a*b* plane is readily spanned on the detector in oscillations of φ, while different c* components are accessible within the opening of the cell of ±30°. The data were indexed and reconstructed high symmetry planes were extracted using the CrysAlis software (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We were able to measure the CDW superstructure peaks (see fig.  <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We showed that δ tends to zero at 4.5GPa, while the CDW transition is supressed at 3.5GPa (see fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This results shows that the CDW modulation and thus the Fermi surface nesting condition slightly changes with pressure.
