<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Proposal title: SAXS analysis of a Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein in complex with its RNA target.</p><p>Proposal number 1437. Assigned number of Shift: 1.</p><p>We came to the synchrotron with several samples containing our PPR protein of interest, alone and in complex with its RNA target site as well as several additional samples from projects related to protein -RNA interaction.</p><p>With the first protein, PPR10, we could obtain a partial result. Indeed, it appears that the protein was in rapid equilibrium between multiple oligomeric states (monomer-dimer at least). This equilibrium prevented clear molecular weight and subsequent envelop calculation. Despite the use of several samples at various concentrations, we could only measure reasonable data from 1 concentration. With these data, an envelope was calculated and we are now trying to fit an atomic model into.</p><p>With the second set of samples, several concentrations of one RNA modifying enzyme were measured but this protein seems to aggregate and we could not obtain reasonable data. We also measured data from a sample with the same protein together with its RNA substrate, however, it appeared that the measure signal corresponded to the RNA alone, again indicating heavy aggregation/precipitation of this particular protein. A third sample was brought along and corresponded to a protein with multiple RNA recognition motifs (RRM). This protein behaved as expected and a nice molecular weight could be obtained as well as an interesting V-shape envelop in which several atomic models of RRM could potentially be fitted. We are now working actively to obtain the protein in complex with its target RNA, and potentially, plan to come back with these samples to further observe how the RNA is associating with these RRMs.</p><p>Finally a sample from another group from our department was also carried with us. This sample was measured successfully and this group has now established a scientific collaboration with the group of Adam Round at ESRF to further analyze these experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, our trip to the SAXS beam line BM29 allowed us to collect data from multiple samples, some with success and some others less successful. The setup was very user friendly and we will certainly apply again to obtain access to BM29. We first have to improve the quality of our samples which will help us make the most out of our measuring time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
