During this time, we were somewhat limited by the detector (see below) hence did not collect data on as many samples as was initiatlly proposed. From the data we collected, we were able to compare the compression of ofloxacin, anhydrous levofloxacin and levofloxacin hemi-hydrate. The compression data for ofloxacin is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> as an example. Pawley refinement of all the data has been performed on these systems and we have been able to determine the Bulk modulus for each of these systems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>We are able to observe some differences in the behaviour between the non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic compression. The non-hydrostatic environment is indicating a lower rate of compression but feedback from conferences has provided a few different experimental avenues to explore that might take into account these differences. We have supplemented the powder diffraction data with in-house single crystal diffraction in the ofloxacin system over the past few months. These data fit well with the powder diffraction data and enables us to explore the system even further. The single-crystal analysis of the levofloxacin and levofloxacin hydrate system are still to be examined.</p><p>This data has been presented at two conferences orally (European Crystallographic Association meeting in Versailles; Cambridge Crsytallographic Data Centre Science Day (Youtube), and as a poster (ECM, EPSRC CMAC Open day).  Key issues: The detector was causing issues througout the beamtime with panels missing from the data. This led to multiple patterns being collected to ensure we had quality data for the compression. The detector was investigated during lunchtime of our final day. This led to the beamtime being cancelled (it was fixed later in the day after packing our samples). Davide collected a set data for of anhydrous pipemidic acid to account for our lost day of beamtime.</p><p>0 2 4 6 8 102.0 102.5 103.0 103.5 104.0 104.5 105.0 No PTM 4:1 M-E Pet β angle (°) Pressure (GPa) 0 2 4 6 8 28.0 28.5 29.0 29.5 30.0 30.5 No PTM 4:1 M-E Pet a axis (Å) Pressure (GPa) 0 2 4 6 8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 No PTM 4:1 M-E Pet b axis (Å) Pressure (GPa) 0 2 4 6 8 15.6 15.8 16.0 16.2 16.4 16.6 16.8 No PTM 4:1 M-E Pet c axis (Å) Pressure (GPa) 0 2 4 6 8 2600 2800 3000 3200 3400 No PTM 4:1 M-E Pet Volume (Å) Pressure (GPa)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Unit cell parameters and volume of ofloxacin as a function of pressure from Pawley fitting of the data.
