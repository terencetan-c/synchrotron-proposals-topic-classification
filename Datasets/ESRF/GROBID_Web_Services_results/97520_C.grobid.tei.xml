<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Knowledge of Mo speciation in hydrothermal fluids is a key to understand the formation of its deposits. We used the in situ synchrotron XAS method to investigate Mo solubility and its speciation in aqueous solutions in equilibrium with MoO2 (tugarinovite), MoO3 (molybdite), and MoS2 (molybdenite) at 300°C and 500 bar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Compared to our previous experiment (Nov. 2021), temperature repartitor made of Mo has been replaced with that made of Cu in the autoclave, which improved the XAS detection limit for Mo by a factor of 100 (from 50 to 0.5 ppm Mo). Unfortunately, the new device lacked Be foils to shield the heat from the Cu sleeve and suffered from temperature gradients within the graphite cell. The resulting fluid convection caused flotation of MoS2 crystals in solution during heating. As a result, we had to hold our solid phase attached to the lower piston of the cell using a cyanoacrylate glue. For future experiments the Cu repartitor will be equipped with Be foils to reduce the temperature gradient. As was checked, such Be foils do not generate detectable Mo signal.</p><p>In 2 experiments with MoO3(s) and water (with or without the glue, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we observed a combined reducing effect of the carbon glassy cell and the glue: Mo concentrations in solution first sharply increased upon heating, then decreased more slowly with time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), likely reaching a steady state at about 0.0004 m Mo, which likely corresponds to the solubility of the MoO2(s) solid phase identified at the end of both runs. Another run with MoO3(s) had more oxidizing conditions by adding 0.5 m H2O2 in the cell. The use of H2O2 eliminated the MoO3(s) reduction and allowed to reach a steady state solubility of 0.01 m Mo. The black line labeled "MoO3-H2O2 ex situ" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) refers to the Mo solubility in 0.5 m H2O2 solution obtained from the quench experiment in Ti autoclave. Work is in progress to determine the exact chemical speciation of Mo in water which was found to be different in equilibrium with MoO3(s) and MoO2(s) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).  In 1 m NaOH solutions, Mo K-edge XANES spectra are similar to that of the 0.05m Na2MoO4 solution at 25°C in which Mo is known to be in the form of tetrahedral Mo VI O4 complexes. Fourier transforms of the EXAFS spectra from this experiment do not show any evidence of Na + that might be expected to be present in the second coordination shell of Mo. The Mo concentrations in solution increase with time in the run started with MoO2(s) (blue points), and slightly decrease with time for the run started with MoO3(s) (red points) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). As in the case of runs in water, the carbon-glassy cell likely reacts with MoO3(s) by partially reducing it to MoO2(s). The measured Mo concentrations in the MoO2(s) run in 1 m NaOH are pretty close to those predicted at equilibrium with the MoO2(s) phase (dashed blue line). In contrast, Mo concentrations measured in the MoO3(s) run are 10 times lower than those predicted in equilibrium with the MoO3(s) phase, but are much closer to those predicted in equilibrium with MoO2(s) and carbon. Such inconsistent trends may be due to combined effects of redox kinetics with the cell material depending of the initial system composition and differences in the experimental temperature between the MoO2-runs (using heat shielding) and MoO3-runs (without heat shielding) that may cause inhomogeneous temperature distribution across the experimental chamber. The presence of quartz in the experimental system with MoO2(s) in 1 m NaOH decreased the Mo solubility at 300°C and 500 bar by a factor of 10 (0.20 m Mo in SiO2-free vs 0.025 m in SiO2-bearing run), which is likely due to the less alkaline pH caused by the dissolution of quartz.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Comparison between the measured Mo concentrations and equilibrium thermodynamic calculations assuming MoO4 2-to be the major aqueous complex <ref type="bibr">(Shock et al., 1997, GCA 61, 907-950)</ref>.</p><p>In sulfur-bearing runs with C2H5NS, MoS2(s) solubility was found to be below the detection limit. Runs with thiosulfate and NaHS showed a few ppm of dissolved Mo. At the same time, the available data on OH-Cl-S complexes predict negligibly small (&lt;100 ppb) Mo concentrations under our conditions. The obtained results are in good agreement with our experiments in the Coretest reactor and batch autoclaves for NaHS and Na2S2O3-HCl solutions, but are 10 times lower in Na2S2O3-NaOH solutions. This might be due to slow reactions rates in sulfate-sulfide solutions at alkaline pH. The spectra obtained in sulfur-bearing systems are very similar to those of the the solid reference (NH4)2MoS4, in which Mo is tetrahedrally coordinated with 4 S atoms. Work is in progress to identify the species and to quantitively assess the role of the HS -versus S3 •-ligands in Mo complexation in hydrothermal fluids.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
