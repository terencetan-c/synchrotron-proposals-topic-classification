<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We make use of a commercial isotactic polypropylene ( iPP) with M w of 365 kg/mol and a polydispersity Mw/Mn of 5.4, blended with a different amount of special nucleating agents such as sodium 2,2-methyl-ene-bis (4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate, NA11. The composition of polymer blends is 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5wt% of NA11, respectively.</p><p>Shear flow experiments in combination with WAXD were carried out in a Linkam Shear Cell (CSS-450) modified with Kapton windows using a 'short term shearing' protocol to investigate how crystal orientation is influenced in the presence of NA11. As a result, under application of shear at high temperature, above the melting point, as at lower temperature, high molecular orientation can be induced depending on flow temperature as well as NA11 amount within polymer.</p><p>In fact, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, which represents a comparison of 2D-WAXD patterns collected after shear applied at different temperatures for a blend of iPP with 0.5wt% of NA11, the presence of nucleating agent is able to orient the α form crystals on cooling as seen from the wide spots formation of (110) α and (040) α of the α form into the pattern, even when flow is applied well 40°C above polymer melting point. Moreover, an outstanding kinetic enhancement can be gained due to NA11 presence within polymer compared to neat polymer, for which the crystal orientation does not occur even if shear applied is high.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows a comparison between 1D-profiles of pure iPP and iPP/NA11 0.5wt% after shear applied at 145°C as a function of time. As displayed, crystallisation as well as very high orientation on molecular level is produced in the blends compared to pure polymer for which crystallisation takes longer time and does not show any molecular orientation. Fig.2. This figure shows a comparison between 1D-profiles of neat polymer (left) and a blend of iPP with 0.5wt% of NA11 (right), after after shear rate application of 100s -1 for 1 s at 145°C, as a function of time.
