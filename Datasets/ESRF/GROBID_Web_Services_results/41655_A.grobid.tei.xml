<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of these measurements is to characterize the behaviour of xenon and iodine in polycristalline titanium nitride (TiN) at high temperature. Previous experiments led by RBS showed that these elements are strongly released from the TiN matrix at high temperature (up to 1700°C) 1 but the mechanisms involved is not known. For xenon, by comparison with previous works led in UO 2 matrix, 2 we can envision the formation of gas bubbles in the material but a migration by atomic migration through vacancies can not be precluded. The latter mechanism could also occur for iodine, but a sole volatilization of this element can also happen. We have thus carried out EXAFS and XANES experiments in order to gain insights into the Xe and I coordination sphere. For time reason during the allocated shifts, most of the analyzed samples contained xenon ; only a couple of iodine samples could be analysed. The influence of the TiN sintered pellets grain size and of the Xe/I concentration is investigated. Sintered TiN pellets are synthesised with three different grain sizes: 8 µm, 18 µm and 38 µm. Xe and I are introduced in the TiN samples at a 150 nm depth by ion implantation, before annealings under vacuum between 1400 and 1700°C. Two concentrations were investigated: 10 17 at/cm² (8 atomic % at the maximum of the distribution) and 10 16 at/cm² (0.8 at. % at the maximum of the distribution). The more concentrated samples were analysed by EXAFS while the low concentration of the latter samples could only allowed us to make XANES analysis. EXAFS and XANES experiments were led at the Xe K-edge (34.561 keV) and I K-edge (33.169 keV) on the FAME beamline at 10 K (helium cryostat) in fluorescence detection. A total of 27 samples were analysed during the 15 shifts allocated.</p><p>Looking at the XANES spectra, the Xe coordination in TiN after implantation does not depend on the grain size of TiN pellets, but a strong influence of the Xe concentration is observed (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). After annealing, XANES spectra are the same for all samples, whatever the initial Xe concentration. EXAFS measurements were performed on samples implanted at a 10 17 at/cm² fluence. No oscillation was observed on as-implanted samples, as a sign that no long-range order exists in the samples. After annealing, Xe-Xe interactions are visible on the FT at a distance R+∆ ~ 4.0 Å (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), which intensity increases with the annealing temperature. This corresponds to the formation of Xe bubbles in our samples, for which the number of Xe neighbours is characteristic of the bubble size while the Xe-Xe distance gives an information on the pressure inside the bubbles. In all Xe annealed samples, Xe-Xe distances were found to be 4.38 Å, which corresponds to the presence of unpressured bubbles. The number of Xe neighbours as a function of the annealing temperature follows two steps: first, we observe an increase of the Xe coordination number up to ~12 which corresponds to the increase of the bubble size. At this stage, the Xe release from the TiN is negligible under annealing. Then, the bubble size remains at its maximum value while the Xe release increases. When the Xe release from the sample reaches 40 %, a decrease of the Xe coordination number to ~6 is observed, hence the presence of smaller bubbles. In the case of iodine sample, we have evidenced by XANES the presence of I(0) in our implanted sample. This probably correspond to the formation of I 2 species, which are highly volatile. We thus can conclude that the release of iodine from TiN at high temperature does not occur through diffusion but by a sole volatilization of I 2 . As a conclusion, those measurements have been very fruitful as they have allowed us to determine the state of xenon and iodine in TiN samples and as a consequence, the mecanisms involved in their release at high temperature.
