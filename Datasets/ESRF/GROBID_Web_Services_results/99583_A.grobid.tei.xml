<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the present experiment, we exploited X-ray phase contrast tomography to investigate the senescenceaccelerated prone (SAMP8) mouse model, which reproduces the effects of the age-related human frailty, a syndrome characterized by cumulative decline at physical, cognitive, and psychological levels, resulting in vulnerability to minor stressors with higher risks of adverse outcomes. SAMP8 exhibits characteristic disorders that correspond to pathophysiological states found in aged humans: decreased motor coordination, cardiovascular alterations, age-related behavioral deterioration such as deficits in learning and memory and emotional disorders, and by pathological alterations in the brain that have been associated with dementia. We investigated SAMP8 and control mice to assess the structural alterations in ileum and colon of mice in aging. In particular we intended to describe and quantify the alterations caused by aging in the intestinal barrier, which appears to be a potential site for inflammation in several neurodegenerative disease. We imaged 12 samples of ileum from SAMP8 mice, and 6 samples from control mice. Then we imaged samples of colon: 5 samples from SAMP8 mice, and 2 samples from control mice. The samples were prepared at Neuroscience Department at "Mario Negri" Institute for Pharmacological Research IRCCS (Milan, Italy) in agreement with current national regulations. The samples will be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24h, then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (70/95/100%), put in propylene oxide, and included in paraffin.</p><p>Data acquisition was carried out using monochromatic incident X-ray beam with an energy of 30 keV. The sample-detector distance was set at 23 cm. The detector had an effective pixel size of 0.7 micron. The tomography was produced by means of 2500 projections covering a total angle range of 180Â°. When required by the sample dimensions, we performed tomographic acquisition by using the extended field-of-view mode. The acquisition time for each angular position was 100 ms.</p><p>Data preprocessing, phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction were performed in situ by using ID17rec and Tomwer software. The process was very time-consuming and often we faced problems, so we have exploited it limitedly to check the quality of the measurements and verify that the samples fitted the FOV.</p><p>Therefore, we have carried out the complete pre-processing, phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction once we returned home by means of our software and optimized scripts. By comparing SAMP8 and control mice we have been able to identify some alterations in the intestinal structure, in particular in the tunica muscolaris and in the Paneth cells, which are a prominent secretory epithelial cell type that resides at the base of intestinal crypts and releases antimicrobial peptides. We are still working on the interpretation of the data with our collaborators of Neuroscience Department at "Mario Negri" Institute for Pharmacological Research IRCCS (Milan, Italy), that are correlating our findings with MRI data acquired on the same mice. In addition, we are performing immuno-histological analysis on the XPCTmeasured samples to unequivocally identify the structures and cells that we are able to see in the tomography images.</p><p>Given the special situation of ID17 at the time we performed the experiment, commissioning, alignment and setup preparation procedures (for which we received extra time) were carried out independently by the users of this beamtime. The results of the experiment appear very good and promising.</p></div>			</div>
