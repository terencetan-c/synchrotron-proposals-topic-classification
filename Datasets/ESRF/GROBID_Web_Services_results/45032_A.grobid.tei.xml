<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), we explored the magnetism of Co and Fe clusters on graphene/Ir(111), which we relate to the cluster size and distribution by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We additionally conducted a preliminary investigation of the ferromagnetic/superparamagnetic transition in a Eu layer intercalated between graphene and Ir(111).</p><p>The experiment was precedented by a thorough preparation time which allowed fine preparation of the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers and adaptation of the heating system to high temperature flashes of the samples, with the help of electron-beam heating. Ir(111) single crystals were prepared by repeated cycles of 1500 K flashes an Ar + sputtering. Graphene was prepared by chemical vapour deposition of ethylene let in the UHV chambers via a leak valve. Co, Fe, Ir and Pt were evaporated at room temperature by electron-beam evaporation with the help of evaporators available at ID08 and a multi-pocket evaporator provided by the Köln applicants. Eu was evaporated thanks to a Knudsen cell provided by the Köln applicants. The preparation time allowed for reliable calibration of the evaporators flux, sample temperature, with the help of in situ postgrowth STM analysis. We systematically addressed the magnetism of Co and Fe nanoclusters selforganized or not on the 2.5 nm pitch graphene/Ir(111) moiré template. Direct evaporation of Co and Fe on graphene/Ir(111) at room temperature yields disordered cluster assemblies, while seeding of the clusters with small Pt or Ir clusters anchored to the moiré sites drives the</p></div>

We made three main findings (Vo- <ref type="bibr">Van, Schumacher, Coraux, Sessi, Fruchart, Brookes, Ohresser, Michely, accepted for publication in Appl. Phys. Lett., arXiv:1107</ref><ref type="bibr">.2571</ref>):</p><p>the magnetic nanoclusters have extremely weak magnetic anisotropy (Figs. 1&amp;2), although orbital moments are slightly enhanced as compared to bulk values, -the temperature-dependent magnetizationmagnetic field (M-H) loops (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) reveal spin blocks which size largely exceeds that of an individual cluster, pointing to inter-cluster magnetic interactions, -facile degradation of the clusters take place upon exposure to the soft X-ray beam, resulting in a loss of magnetic moment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> inset). The XMCD signal was recorded in total electron yield (TEY) under several X-ray beam incidences in order to derive the spin and orbital moment contributions with the help of sum rules. Subtracting the TEY at the L 3 edge and pre-edge value, and normalizing to the pre-edge value, yielded M-H loops, which were measured at two incidences and various temperatures. Smaller clusters (e.g. ~ 25 Co atoms) are found superparamagnetic at the lowest accessible temperature (~10 K). A last sample was devoted to a preliminary investigation of the magnetism in Eu-intercalated graphene/Ir(111).</p><p>Following roomtemperature evaporation of about 70 % of an Eu monolayer, mild annealing lead to intercalation of a (√3×√3) Eu layer and re-evaporation of the excess Eu. The XMCD signal and M-H loops acquired at the Eu M-edge reveal strong magnetic anisotropy, with an in-plane easy axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The Eu layer is ferromagnetic at 10 K and has barely detectable coercivity around 40 K, pointing to a blocking temperature between 10 and 50 K (further experiments are needed for finer assessment). These observations compare well with recent spin-polarized density functional theory calculations pointing to a magnetic phase transition at a few 10 K, and call for more comprehensive and systematic measurements.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) TEY for Pt 13 Co 26 clusters across the L 2,3 Co absorption edges, for left and right-circularly polarized X-rays in perpendicular ( ┴ ) incidence, at 5 T and 10 K.
