If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. This behavior indicates that there are some special processes of M-superstructure formation.

The phonon spectrum has been collected at different points of the Brillouine zone and various temperatures. The main attention has been paid to direction [110] (Σ-direction). Here we have focused on M-point q = (½ ½ 0) and center of Brillouine zone near Bragg peak Q = (2 0 0). The measurements have been carried out for 4 temperatures in paraelectric phase and 1 temperature in intermediate phase. The example of collected spectra is shown in figure 1. Two strong phonon resonances are observed at this spectrum. Low-energy peaks correspond to the transverse acoustic (TA) phonons with polarization vector e = (1 -1 0) ("in-plane" phonon). High-energy peaks correspond to the transverse optic (TO) phonon. As the result of the fit by the sum of 4 phonon resonances TA and TO phonons dispersions have been obtained. The temperature evolution of TA phonon dispersion is shown in figure 2. While temperature decreases approaching the phase transition temperature the energy of TA phonon branch goes down. After transition to intermediate phase the TA phonon energy raises. Temperature evolution of spectrum in M-point has been traced (figure 3). The interesting behavior of central peak has been obtained. The central peak intensity at M-point of the Brillouine zone demonstrates critical growth on approaching the phase transition.</figDesc></figure>
