<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The phenomenon of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) in catalysis has been long known. This phenomenon manifests as a gross reduction in the capacity of metal nanoparticles (e.g. Pt) anchored upon reducible oxides, such as TiO2, to adsorb gases after high temperature treatment. The most widely accepted mechanism, as this is what is observed in electron microscopy, is "direct encapsulation", wherein a partial reduction of the support around the Pt metal/oxide interface occurs first. This is followed by encapsulation of the metal nanoparticle by an oxidic shell.</p><p>During the present experiments, we investigated this phenomena studying two different Pt/TiO2 catalysts. One catalyst with the anatase and the other with the rutile crystal structure. By employing time resolved highresolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) and high-angle pair distribution function (PDF) measurements, we captured the response of the catalyst structure to a change in the gas atmosphere.</p><p>We covered a temperature range from room temperatures up to 700 °C (in 100 °C steps) and performed different experiments with alternating gas atmospheres (Ar  H2  Ar  O2) as well as switches from Ar to only one of the two gases (H2 or O2). The big amount of condition space that we covered in the series of experiments gives us the confidence that we will be able to construct a condition-structure map of the catalysts, which will contain structural understanding to level of detail not described before.</p><p>Our intitial analysis of the data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1+2</ref>) suggests that there are severe strucutral changes occuring and that the behaviour is strongly dependent on the underlying structure of the TiO2. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> depicts the Pt(111) reflection at 400 °C evolving with time while the gas atmosphere was changed. It can be found that the Pt reflection of the rutile catalysts responds to larger degree than the anatase catalyst. Yet, in both samples changes are visible and especially changes in the background are observed. Using the PDF data, we hope to also decipher the contribution of amorphous phases to the strucutre.</p><p>As the temperature was increased the observed reversible and irreversible changes within the catalyst's strucutre became much more pronounced. As can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, when the same gas switches were carried out at 700 °C. The platinum reflection underwent much more substantial transformations. For the anatase catalyst under hydrogen the platinum reflection weakens strongly in intesity while the reflection also shifts to higher angles which hints at a contraction of the Pt unit cell. For rutile, a similar shift of the reflection can be seen, however the peak is not decreasing in intensity. This preliminary analysis reveals that there are substantially diffferent mechanisms at work which involve the Pt and TiO2 phase.</p><p>The successfully acquired data is currently analyzed.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Contour plots of the Pt(111) reflection region at 400 °C of the aquired high-resolution diffraction patterns during dynamic switches between Ar, H2, and O2 (as indicated) of the two tested catalysts of Pt/TiO2 with either anatase or rutile structure.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.00,174.84,533.00,220.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
