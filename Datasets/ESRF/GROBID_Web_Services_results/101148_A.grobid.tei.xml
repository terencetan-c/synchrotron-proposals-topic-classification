<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Unfortunately, the cycle life of these materials is relatively short due to structural instability. However, the loss in performance over time can be delayed by either bulk or surface Zr-doping. The goal of this experiment is to perform operando HE-XRD on different Zr-doped/coated and undoped electrodes in fresh and aged assembled cells to understand the exact role and behaviour of the dopant in the host NMC structure during cycling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup and Sample Preparation:</head><p>In this experiment we performed vertical and horizontal linescans collecting 2D XRD patterns of 3 Swagelok cells, composed of 3 different cathodes: Undoped, Zr-doped and Zr-coated NMC811 in electrolyte solution of LiFP6 in EC:DMC 1:1 and Metal Lithium as a counter anode. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The initial idea of the proposal was to cycle the cells up to 4.4V first and then rise the voltage to 4.5V to speed up the degradation process of the cathode material while monitoring its evolution. Processing the data during the beamtime, we noticed that, at 4.4V, the Undoped NMC sample owned an unreacted phase, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Since we did not know the nature of its sudden appearence, we decided to increase the upper voltage limit of the subsequent cycle not anymore to 4.5V as declared in the proposal, but to 4.6V. In this way we stressed and pushed the delithation process at the expenses of possible permanent collapse of the structure. At 4.6V (while keeping the voltage costant) we noticed that the permanent phase started to slowly react and transition. A third cycle up to 4.8V was performed, showing that the material needed a much higher overpotential to fully react at 1C. This happened also for the Zr-Coated NMC sample. Whereas, the Zr-Doped NMC sample even at 4.4V was able to fully react without applying any overvoltage. This evidence tell us that in a comparable voltage window from 3.0 to 4.4V, the doped sample is able to withdraw 100% amount of Li + ions from the cathode material. What has to be underlined is that the cells were all equally cycled at the same C-rate (1C). The unreacted phase is present because the Li + removal from the host structure is kinetically limited by the fast C-rates, however, this did not happen for the Zr-Doped NMC sample. The doping is likely to ease the Li + diffusion, therefore, the material could find applications on devices that require faster charging rates.</p><p>In the literature we usually find works where cycling rates are rather slow (0.1C/0.2C), mostly limited by Bragg-Brentano geometries and slow acquisition times at laboratory scale. The cell electrochemistry can not be faster than XRD acquisition time. But this has been possible at ID31 where energies were high enough to probe inside the PEEK body of the cell, and thanks to 2D Pilatus 2M Detector we were able to take full XRD snaposhots in 1s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problems Encountered:</head><p>The change of plans that brough us to cycle the cells 3 times and not 2, prolonged the overall time for measuring each sample which ended up only on the fresh and not being able to study the aged one. It happens pretty often in electrochemical inoperando studies that the cells fail, which led us to open, wash, bake and reassembling them few times (requires from 6 to 8hrs). Sine the priority was given to the fresh samples to have a consistent rack of data, aged electrodes were left behind. This, unfortunately, kept out still few unanswered questions.</p><p>Next-Plans-To Be Done: 1) Reduce the number of filters for Zr-Coated NMC aged electrode to see whether Li2ZrO3 is visible and reactive.</p><p>2) When samples are cycled at least 100 times, inevitably, fatigued phases will appear. The idea is to look again at Undoped NMC/Zr-Doped NMC aged samples and check whether the doped one is still able to fully delithiate (100%) and in case of unreacted phase, quantify it and estimate when the fatigued phase might appear. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: Role of Zr-doping for stabilization of next generation positive electrode materials in Lithium Ion Batteries Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Mattia Colalongo (ESRF, Grenoble / Aalto University, Finland) Dr. Basit Ali (Aalto University, Finland) Prof. Tanja Kallio (Aalto University, Finland) Dr. Tobias Schulli (ESRF, Grenoble) Dr. Jakub Drnec (ESRF, Grenoble) Abstract: Layered Ni-rich lithiated metal oxides such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) are attractive candidates as next-generation Li-battery (LiB) positive electrode materials due to their high capacities and reasonable price.</figDesc></figure>
