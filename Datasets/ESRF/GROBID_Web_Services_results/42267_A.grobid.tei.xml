<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>POLAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is a novel compact space-borne Compton polarimeter conceived for a precise measurement of hard X-ray polarization and optimized for the detection of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) photons in the energy range 50-500 keV. The flight model will consist of 25 modules, each built with an array of 8x8 plastic scintillator bars, and read-out by one multi-anode photomultiplier (MAPM). We have performed a systematic calibration of one modular unit of POLAR (dimensions ~5x5x20cm, total weight ~10kg including mechanical support and shielding; see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) over a wide energy range (46keV-511keV) with a highenergy 100% polarized synchroton radiation source at the beam line ID15 at ESRF. The detector is placed inside an eulerian cradle, fixed on a translating table. The experiment consists of recording all pairs of bars that show a coincident energy deposition &gt; 5 keV; one is the Compton scattering of the incoming photon, the other is the interaction by Compton or photoelectric effect of the secondary photon, usually in another region of the detector. The distribution of the azimuthal scattering angle ξ is referred to as modulation curve, which can be described with the following function: C M (ξ)= P 0 [1+P 1 cos (2ξ+P 2 )]. The angle of polarization (P 2 ) and the modulation factor (µ=P 1 ) are obtained from the fit, while the degree of linear polarization is Π=µ/µ 100 , where µ 100 is the response of the instrument to a fully polarized photon flux. The trigger condition is fullfilled if the dynode signal is above the threshold; the event (the energy depositions in all 64 channels) is then saved on file. Only about 15% of the triggered events pass the quality cuts and are registered in the modulation curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The experiment:</head><p>In order to be able to calibrate the detector with unpolarized γ-rays from radioactive sources once back to our home institute, we have chosen during the beam test energy levels (except 200 keV) identical to the ones of available radioactive sources: 46.5, 59, 88, 122, 200, 288, 356 and 511 keV. Each time the monochromator was displaced in order to change energy range (it was done 3 times in 6 days), the detector had to be aligned on the beam, with a resolution better than 1mm. This was achieved each time in less than 2 hours (except the first time, which took longer), which demanded a large effort since the pixel size of the detector is 6mm. For each energy level we performed two main measurements:</p><p>• A scan of the 64 bars (20,000 triggers in the center of each bar) for polarization angles 0° and 90°.</p><p>The detector was rotated along the beam axis (x axis) in order to achieve polarization angles different from 0°. At 4 energies the scan was performed also at 30°, 45° and 60°. These scans have provided a uniform illumination of the detector with photons at different polarization angles.</p><p>• A high statistics scan of 3 representative bars (one in the center and 2 close to the edges), for many polarization angles: 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90°, with 200,000 triggers in each run. These measurements are aimed to study the differences between the center and the periphery of the detector, and also to study the influence of the different gain of the MAPM cells on the result. For 2 energies, and on 2 bars only, very high statistics runs with 1,000,000 triggers for few polarization angles were performed, to study with good details very small variations in the modulation curves. The data taking has proceeded smoothly with shifts over 24 hours for the whole period, and a total of ~90 million triggers have been collected. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (left) shows the events collected as function of time.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Although the data analysis is ongoing (therefore all results are to be treated as preliminary), we can already show that there is good agreement between the experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations, performed with a GEANT4 package. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the modulation curves obtained with data collected at ESRF for 100% polarized beam of photons with polarization angles 0° and 90°, and for an unpolarized beam. The curves are well reproduced by a fit function f(x)=P 0 [1+P 1 cos 2(ξ + P 2 ) + P 3 cos 4(ξ + P 4 )], where one term describes the beam polarization (amplitude P 1 and phase P 2 ), and the other is due to the square geometry of the detector (double frequency, amplitude P 3 and phase P 4 ). The modulation due to geometry (P 3 ) is ~10%, while the modulation due to the polarization depends on the energy, and is ~30%.</p><p>The work described here is the subject of a scientific article in preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The experimental setup: the detector in the eulerian cradle (left) and the NIM-CAMAC read-out electronics (right).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,82.08,250.08,251.28,188.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div><head>Prospects for the future:</head><p>The limiting factor for the read-out speed has been the PC used for saving data on disk, that will be substituted for future tests by a custom read-out system, currently under testing, specifically built for POLAR. The new electronics is also able to trigger independently on each of the 64 channels, and to lower the trigger threshold to ~5keV. In future experiments with synchroton radiation, the device under test will be the Engineering and <rs type="person">Qualification Model</rs> of <rs type="funder">POLAR</rs>, which consists of 16 modules. These new measurements will allow us to test the trigger logic between various modules and address issues that could not be studied in the first beam test, such as a study of the modulation as function of the ϕ angle (rotation along vertical axis).</p></div>
