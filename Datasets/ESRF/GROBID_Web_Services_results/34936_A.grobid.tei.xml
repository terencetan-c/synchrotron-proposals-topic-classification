<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A set of XAS spectra at the P K-edge has been succesfully collected for a wide group of silicate glasses representing different magma compositions spanning from granitic to ferrobasaltic, with various alkali to Aluminum ratio, different bulk chemistry, and synthetised over different oxygen fugacities. One of the two ferrobasaltic set, has been already characterised by Fe K-edge XAS spectroscopy to provide Fe oxidation state, coordination numbers and Fe-O bond distances. Averaging up to 50 scans allowed to obtain spectra with a very good signal to noise ratio. For the most important samples, also short EXAFS spectra have been collected up to K=7 Ã… -1 . A set of synthetic and natural P model compounds have been collected as well in order to interpret some spectral features (presence/absence of a pre-edge peak, and variations of the white-line intensity and energy position). Theoretical XANES calculations are being performed by means of the mxan code in order to reproduce the spectral features found in the experimental data. Preliminary results allowed to find that PO 4 tetrahedra in the silicate network are bonded by the corners to AlO 4 and FeO 4 tetrahedra. No detectable changes are observed in a series of glasses where Fe is known to vary from five-fold coordinated Fe2+ to four-fold coordinated Fe3+. As literature data indicate that P Kedge data are sensibly affected by a variation of second coordination shell cations chemistry and oxidation state, this imply that Fe is not the main cation bonded to PO 4 units. Further XANES theoretical calculations, along with analysis of EXAFS data are currently in progress in order to better constrain the local chemistry and structure around PO 4 units in the studied glasses.</p></div>		</body>
