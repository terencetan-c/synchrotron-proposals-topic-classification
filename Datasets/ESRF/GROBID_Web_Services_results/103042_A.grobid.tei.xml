<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory Support Facility</head><p>• BioMedical Facility • Central Chemistry Lab (Science Building) • PSCM Labs (Science Building) • Protein Support labs • icOS Lab (in crystallo Optical Spectroscopy)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global Summary</head><p>Global Summary of this new BAG proposal including projects/experiments proposed and justification of the beamtime requested. Enter 8000 chars maximum (approximately 1000 words).</p><p>ALZARI Bacterial signalling and cell division: The broader aim of the proposed experiment is to understand the molecular mechanisms of divisome and elongasome assembly and regulation in Corynebacteriales. In order to achieve this, we are using an integrative structural biology approach. High-resolution structures of individual components of the divisome/elongasome as well as sub-complexes formed of 2 or more proteins will be required. The samples that will be used are proteins of the actinobacterial divisome (FtsZ, FtsQ/B/L, SteA/B, RipA, Sip1, Sip2, DivIVA) and mutants thereof, as well as protein complexes whenever they can be isolated and crystallized. In parallel we will aim to identify new protein partners of the divisome using proteomic approaches, which will then be subjected to crystallization.</p><p>Actinobacterial central metabolism: we study the molecular basis of the fine regulation of central metabolism in actinobacteria, in the frame of an ANR/DFG grant with two groups in Germany (M. Bott, FZ Jülich, and B. Eikmanns, Univ. of Ulm). In particular, we are investigating protein-protein interactions and signal transduction along the GlnH-GlnX-PknG-GarA pathway, responsible, in Corynebacteriales, for the regulation of key metabolic enzymes located at the 2oxoglutarate node (crossroad between carbon and nitrogen metabolism). Still part of this collaboration, we are performing structural studies on corynebacterial pyruvate-quinone oxidoreductase (PQO), an alternative way for pyruvate oxidation which physiological role is still to be determined.</p><p>DNA gyrases and topoisomerases: We solved the structure of the four individual Mtb DNA gyrase domains and of a full fusion version of this atypical protein. This permitted to dissect the structural aspects of the catalytic cycle of this gyrase. We are now working on its structural homolog from Corynebacterium glutamicum. We want to pursue the full structural characterization of the DNA gyrase in complex with its partners, e.g. solve the structures of these partners alone and in complex with the protein (individual domains but also entire enzyme) and inhibitors. These data are essential to understand the mechanisms of regulation of this family of topoisomerases.</p><p>Collaborative projects: in parallel to the main projects of the lab, described above, several collaborative projects on structural enzymology are ongoing, essentially on proven drug targets, or proteins involved in antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Noteworthy, we are part of an internal collaborative effort to develop new, highly active inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (nsp5), which will involve extensive cocrystallization/soaking trials on nsp5 crystals for all promising hits (in collaboration with the crystallography platform, also part of this BAG). Another project concerns the structural characterization of the mycobacterial Bayer-Villiger monooxygenase EthA, known to be involved in the activation of several anti-tuberculosis prodrugs (collaboration J. Kordulakova, Univ. of Bratislava, Slovakia). DELARUE 1) DNA/RNA polymerases project: we plan to solve the structure of the primer-independent PiPOLB polymerase in presence of DNA. In addition, we have crystals of a simplified multi-subunit RNA polymerase that we have phased and that diffract to 4.0 Angstrom. We plan to collect data at higher resolution and also to solve its complex with a helicase. Other RNA polymerases of viral origin are being cloned and expressed for crystallization tests. Moreover, DNA polymerases of other phages that possess highly modified DNA are being studied to understand how they cope with this modified DNA as a template.</p><p>2) Archaeal replisome: Chromosomal DNA replication requires the complex interplay of a large number of protein factors in a coordinated manner. This multiprotein replication machine is named the replisome. As DNA replication depends on the coordinated interplay between many replication factors, Current trends are to determine the structures of complexes between different replication factors and DNA. Our model system is Pyrococcus abyssi, a hyperthermophilic archaea that was isolated next to ocean hot vents. The archaeal replisome is often considered as a simpler version of the eukaryotic one, and most archaeal replication factors express readily in E. coli and are good structural models. We have recently determined the first crystal and cryo-EM structures of the replication protein A, a key actor of the replisome that coats and protects single-stranded DNA from nucleases. We will now determine structures of the replication protein A in complex with other key actors of the replisome, including the DNA polymerase and the DNA primase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HAOUZ</head><p>Several research teams at the Institut Pasteur have federated their expertise as a consortium to initiate drug discovery projects around the strategic axes of the Institut Pasteur, including antimicrobioal resistance, emerging infectious diseases, central nervous system pathologies and cancer. These teams offer complementary expertise in chemical library design and management, genetic screening (siRNA/gRNA), chemistry, virtual screening and chemoinformatics using Deep Learning, in vitro ADME-Tox profiling, and technologies available to support target identification/engagement. Many proteins targets are now included in this pipeline such as (SARS-CoV-2 NSP5 protease; epigenetic methyltransferases; Plasmodium vivax SUB1 protease; Mycobacterial histidine kinases; Cys-loops receptors; and others).</p><p>04-11-2022 -3 of 6 -As a member of the drug discovery consortium at Pasteur, the crystallography platform will provide expertise in (i) HTS crystallization to generate crystals of drugtarget complexes (ii) X-Ray data collection to solve the corresponding 3D structures. The final goal of these projects is to validate a potential hit to pave the way for the development of news drugs against human diseases.</p></div>

Little is known about the EFC organization on the viral surface or the mechanisms of activation and repression. The objective is to obtain high resolution structures of the entry-fusion complex embedded in membranes alone and in complex with fusion repressors. This project could help to better understand and develop treatments against poxviruses, but also for other related DNA viruses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples Scientific Justification</head><p>• BUNV (Bunyavirus glycoproteins)Bunyaviruses is a large family of viruses that infect humans and animals with great relevance in human health. The envelope glycoproteins are the sole target for neutralizing antibodies and antivirals and we are still working on their structures in order to develop novel immunogens for vaccination. We have already solved the structures of several bunyaviral glycoproteins both in prefusion and postfusion conformations and we are still working on glycoproteins of other bunyaviruses in complex or not with neutralizing human antibodies.</p><p>• CELL (Cellular membrane fusion proteins)We have determined the crystal structure of the C. elegans protein EFF-1, a member of the "fusion family" (FF). EFF-1 is responsible for a cell-cell fusion event during skin formation in the nematode. We will now focus in determining the crystal structure of the monomeric pre-fusion form of EFF-1, and of the intact trans-membrane post fusion trimer. IWe want also make use the experience accumulated over the years in crystallizing viral glycoproteins, to apply it to the conserved family of HAP2/GSC1 proteins involved in fusion of gametes during fertilization. These proteins exhibit a similar pattern of secondary structure elements in the ectodomain as class II proteins, but only a crystallographic analysis can identify a possible structural homology and provide the basis to understand the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell fusion.</p><p>• CgLpd (Corynebacterial dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase)Conserved FAD-dependent dehydrogenase, essential to the PDH and ODH reactions and component of a mixed PDH-ODH supercomplex in C. glutamicum. The structure has been solved, but experiments are ongoing to clarify its regulation and proteinprotein interactions within the supercomplex.</p><p>• DENV (Dengue virus envelope proteins)We solved several structures of envelope protein E from dengue virus from all the serotype (DENV-1-4) in complex with neutralizing antobody fragments Fab/scFv. We are still working on complexes of E with monoclonal human antibodies. In general we have small crystals and a microfocus beamline is essential to pursue the project.</p><p>04-11-2022</p><p>-5 of 6 -</p><p>• EthA (FAD-dependent monooxygenase EthA)Bayer-Villiger monooxygenase known to be involved in the activation of a number of prodrugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As the enzyme has so far escaped all attempts to structural determination, we are working on its Mycobacterium thermoresistibile orthologue. Diffracting crystals have been obtained and their optimization is in progress (collab. Jana Kordulakova, Comenius Univ. Bratislava, Slovakia).</p><p>• FLAV (Flavivirus envelope proteins (POW,KFDV,OHFV))We are trying to crystallize the post-fusion form of sE from several flaviviruses with a longer stem in order to better understand the role of the stem during the fusion process.</p><p>• FtsB (Corynebacterial cell division protein FtsB)FtsB is part of the actinobacterial divisome for which we are trying to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of assembly and regulation. We are trying to co-crystallize this membrane protein in complex with its native partners, FtsQ and FtsL.</p><p>• FtsL (Corynebacterial cell division protein FtsL)FtsL is part of the actinobacterial divisome for which we are trying to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of assembly and regulation. We are trying to co-crystallize the membrane protein complex with its partners, FtsB and FtsQ.</p><p>• FtsQ (Corynebacterial cell division protein FtsQ)FtsQ is part of the actinobacterial divisome for which we are trying to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of assembly and regulation. The protein from two different actinobacterial species is currently undergoing crytsallization trials. We will eventually try to cocrystallize with its native partners, FtsB and FtsL.</p><p>• FtsX (ABC transporter permease FtsX)Part of a membrane transporter involved in cell division, proposed to promote cell separation with the peptidoglycan hydrolase RipC</p><p>• GDH (Mycobacterial glutamate dehydrogenase)Key protein for mycobacterial metabolism, inhibited by the FHA protein GarA as for the a-ketoglutarate decarboxylase KGD. However, the mechanism of inhibition by GarA on this enzyme is still unknown. Crystals diffracting to low resolution have been obtained and their optimization is in progress.</p><p>• HANT (Hantaan virus envelope proteins)Hantaviruses are important pathogens in humans and animals. We have obtained crystals of the viral envelope glycoprotein Gc. We are still working on glycoproteins of several hantavirus such as Andes virus.</p><p>• HSV (Herpes virus envelope proteins)We obtained a complete data set at 2.9 A resolution and solved the structure of pseudorabies gH fragment in complex with a Fab using MAD phasing. We still work on gH/gL complex from Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and pseudorabies virus.</p><p>• KRV (Kamiti River virus envelope proteins)Kamiti River virus (KRV) is a insect-specific flavivirus (ISF), which unlike the pathogenic flavivirus fails to replicate into mammalian cells. The envelope proteins of the ISFs have the characteristic to have a short-stem compared to the pathogenic flavivirus. We are interested in the interaction of the stem (before the trans-membrane region) with the fusion loops to better understand the fusion process. We solved the structure of soluble E glycoprotein of KRV in a post-fusion form with a short-stem. We have now crystals of the KRV sE protein with longer stems.</p><p>• MTGyr (M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase)We have solved the structure of the four individual Mtb DNA gyrase domains and of a full fusion version of this atypical protein. This permitted to dissect the structural aspects of the catalytic cycle of this gyrase. We want to pursue the full structural characterization of the DNA gyrase in complex with its partners, e.g. solve the structures of these partners alone and in complex with the protein (individual domains but also entire enzyme) and inhibitors. These data are essential to understand the mechanisms of regulation of this atypical topoisomerase. Crystals for a full length version of the gyrase are available, they diffract to 20A and have to be optimised (extensive screening)</p><p>• OdhI (Corynebacterial FHA regulator OdhI)OdhI is a small, FHA domain protein found in Actinobacteria and acting as a metabolic switch. We are characterizing complexes of this protein with the target enzymes in order to decipher the molecular basis of OdhI regulation.</p><p>• pLGIC (Pentameric ligand gated ion channel from bacteria)Pentameric ligand gated ion channel mediate signal transduction in the brain, for instance at the synaptic cleft. Bacterial homologues in this protein family are currently the only ones amenable to x-ray crystallography. Our group pioneered the discovery and structural characterization the the GLIC homologue <ref type="bibr">(Bocquet et al., Nature 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, Nury et al., PNAS 2010)</ref>. We now try to further understand the gating mechanism of the protein by crystallizing it in several conformations. This implies mutagenesis, change of conditions, addition of ligands, etc... We need to test a lot of tiny crystals of this membrane protein that rarely diffract, Therefore we need regular access to beamlines with good automation and good vizualization/centering systems like the ESRF ones. We rarely need MAD or SAD for this project.</p><p>• PolD (archaeal DNA polymerase D)PolD is a novel DNA polymerase. It is essential in Archaea and have a great biotechnological potential</p><p>• PQO (Pyruvate:quinone oxidoreductase)Pyruvate:quinone oxidoreductase is a known metabolic alternative for pyruvate oxidation in actinobacteria, but its physiological role stays unknown. We therefore aim at studying the structure and the regulation of this enzyme from Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is closely related to homologous enzymes from other actinobacteria (but not Mycobacterium, where it is absent), enterobacteria and pseudomonads and more distantly related to pyruvate oxidases from "low GC Gram-positive bacteria" (lactic acid bacteria, bacillales). The enzyme is known to bind FAD and TPP.</p><p>• RipC (Peptidoglycan hydrolase RipC)</p><p>• RSV (Respiratory syncitial virus ribonucleoprotein)Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children worldwide. It is a nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the order Mononegavirales. The viral RNA of Mononegavirales is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N), making a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of defined stoichiometry. This RNP complex serves as the template for viral RNA replication and transcription by the polymerase complex. When N is expressed in E. coli forms a ring-like structure, composed predominantly of 10 molecules of N and a short non-specific RNA of ¡Ö 70 bases. This structure will constitute the first atomic structure of the ribonucleoprotein of a Mononegavirales.</p><p>• Rv1698 (Mycobacterial cell division protein Rv1698)Protein involved in cell division and septation in Corynebacteriales, where it is supposed to form a complex with SteA. Our structural data on the Corynebacterium glutamicum orthologue, as well as the preliminary data on the mycobacterial Rv1698 argue against this protein being a porin as proposed in the literature. We are now pursuing the structural and functional characterization of this protein.</p><p>• SARS (Coronavirus spike protein)We study neutralizing and potentially broadly cross-reactive nanobodies against the S proteins of betacoronaviruses.</p><p>• Sip2 (Divisome protein Sip2)Sip2 is a newly identified divisome member from C. glutamicum and its function is unknown.

Relevant results include the crystal structures of: catalytic domain of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (AceF) in complex with the N-terminal peptide of OdhA; dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (Lpd) in complex with the PSBD domain, at 1.6 Å resolution (Yang et al., in preparation); C. glutamicum pyruvate quinone oxidoreductase (collaboration with B. Eikmanns, Ulm); ligand binding domain of the chemoreceptor Htc10 from Halomonas titanicae (collaboration with M.N.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEAMLINE PERFORMANCE:</head><p>Our users confirm their overall satisfaction with the structural biology beamlines at the ESRF, and would like to thank the beamline managers and all the staff for the very successful upgrade of synchrotron facilities and beamline instrumentation. We are also grateful to all our local contacts and beamline scientists for their commitment to set up our experiments in remote access. It is worth to note that the new MXCuBE3 user interface contributed to make remote access work on all the MX beamlines significantly more fluent and user friendly, and was particularly appreciated. a-ketoacid dehydrogenase are large, evolutionary conserved multi-enzymatic complexes that carry out key oxidative reactions in central metabolism. For decades, these complexes, of which the most known is pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), have been thought to share a similar organization in all aerobic organisms, structured around a hollow core resulting from the high oligomeric arrangement of the acyltransferase component. We show in this work that Actinobacteria, one of the largest eubacterial phyla, break this 'dogma' owing to a distinct trimeric acetyltransferase core. Specifically, using Corynebacterium glutamicum as a model, we show how a unique C-terminal helix in the acetyltransferase (AceF) catalytic domain, which bears an actinobacterial-specific insertion, precludes higher order protein oligomerization. This feature, together with the presence of an odhA gene that codes for a fusion enzyme carrying both the oxoglutarate decarboxylase and the succinyltransferase domains on the same polypetide, is spread over Actinobacteria and reflects the association of PDH and ODH into a single physical complex. Considering the central role of the pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate nodes in central metabolism, and the importance of Actinobacteria for human welfare, our findings pave the way to both therapeutic and metabolic engineering applications.     M.-C. Vaney 1,8 , M. Dellarole 1,5,8 , S. Duquerroy 1,2,8 , I. Medits 3 , G. Tsouchnikas 3,6 , A. Rouvinski The flavivirus particle's life cycle includes four key steps: 1-assembly of glycoproteins prM and E into icosahedral spiky immature particles made of (prM/E)3 into the neutral pH environment of the ER lumen; 2-maturation of virions across the mildly acidic pH of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) involves an acid-pH-driven rearrangement into smooth particles made of (prM/E)2 dimers exposing a furin site for prM cleavage into "pr" and "M". "pr" stays still bound to the E dimers to protect the E fusion-loop to go into a premature fusion in the acidic TGN; 3-exit to the neutral pH extracellular environment where "pr" is released from the particle, leading to an infectious particle; 4-entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis into a target cell, and fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes at the mildly acidic endosomal pH.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Actinobacteria challenge the paradigm: a unique protein architecture for a well-known central metabolic complex</head><p>All the mechanistic molecular understanding of these pH-driven particle transitions taking place during fusion, maturation and secretion of flavivirus particles was lacking.</p><p>We showed that "pr" is related to the family of DnaJ/ HSP40 cellular co-chaperons present in the ER, reflecting a specific adaptation to the unique features of flavivirus morphogenesis and entry into cells. We solved the x-ray structure of (pr/sE)2 dimer of tick-borne encephalitis virus at acidic pH, and revealed the crucial role for the 150-loop of E in relaying the fusion-loop capping role of "pr" upon secretion. This new identified molecular switch, used to control the processes of virus assembly, virus maturation and entry into new cells, was found to be valid for all flaviviruses, including several pathogen mosquito-borne viruses (e.g., dengue, yellow fever, Zika, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus).</p><p>Structure of TBEV (prM/E)2 dimer</p></div>			</div>
