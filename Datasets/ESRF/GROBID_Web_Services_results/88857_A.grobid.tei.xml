<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The rapid emergence and spread of multi drug resistance alongside the negligible activity of major pharma companies in the design of new antibiotics cause a world crisis. Hence, the current situation is frequently described as a "catastrophe" Hence, in 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the antibiotic resistance is leading to "post-antibiotic era", and declared it a substantial threat to human health. Even the World Bank estimated ~4% of the global economy will be lost by 2050 because of resistance to antibiotics.</p><p>The treatments of infections with the available arsenal of clinically used antibiotics have been badly affected by the appearance of multidrug-resistant strains. For example, at present many infections are caused by highly resistant bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus. These Gram-positive, versatile and potentially aggressive strains are among the most worrisome pathogenic bacteria. In this study we attempt to decipher the structural basis for S. aureus mutant in the large subunit protein uL22 that is resistant to erythromycin (SA70SL22). uL22 resides on the wall of the polypeptide exit tunnel but the erythromycin binding site is more than 12 Å away from it.</p><p>During our MX-2003 session at CM01, 3,452 micrographs were collected with the following settings: each micrograph is composed of 40 frames where each was collected for 0.2s which leads to an 8s movie with a total dose of 40 e -/Å 2 per movie. From these movies 529,786 particles were selected for 2D classification. Then 145,897 particles were selected for 3D classification and 124,731 particles were selected for 3D refinement. After post processing we obtained a 3.58Å reconstructed map of the SA70SL22 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>After fitting as a starting model that of the SA70S (PDBID: 5TCU) into the cryo-EM reconstructed map it can be seen (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) that the large subunit, 50S part, led to a quite nice and crispy map that covers most of the initial model while the small subunit, 30S part, is less resolved. Consequently, the map is of lower resolution and parts of the particle are absent from the map. We often observe this phenomena in cryo-EM reconstrutctions of empty ribosomes (as the current sample). Zooming into the deletion site in rProtein uL22 of the starting model, some density is missing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Therefore there are slim chances for modeling the deletion mutant uL22 rProtein in our current reconstructed map. At this point we plan to try and include more particles in the calculations. We might be able to obtain a better map if we pick more particles after 2D classification, when using only the large subunit initial model, ignoring the small subunit part, and applying focus refinement on it. However, the dificulties in tracing the loop of interest may be the result of the disorder caused by the deletion, and this is the reason for the problematic resistant phynotype. Consequently, more data treatment is neededin order to determine if more data collection is needed.
