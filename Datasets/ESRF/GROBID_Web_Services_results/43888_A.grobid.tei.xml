<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have developed a technique for correlative 3D imaging of both structure and elemental composition for extended objects and applied to visualize the subcellular response in rat lung tissue to toxic stress after exposure of the lungs to nanotubes.</p><p>Nanoscale electron density and elemental composition laminography was implemented at the nano-imaging endstation ID22NI of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). A Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system was used to focus x-rays of 17 keV energy to a focal spot of 47 (V) × 82 (H) nm 2 (FWHM) with a flux of more than 10 12 photons/s in the focus. To get laminographic images, we set the sample rotation axis at a 60° inclination with respect to the incoming beam. For electron density imaging, the x-ray focus was used as a virtual source, and magnified images of the sample (at 60 nm pixel size) were obtained with x-ray projection microscopy. Phase retrieval was then performed on the images with the contrast transfer function method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to get the x-ray phase modulation due to the sample. The lateral field of view was 90 × 90 μm 2 with the thickness of the sample that could be imaged being approximately equal to the lateral field of view. The elemental composition was imaged with the sample at the x-ray focus. An energy sensitive detector, placed at 90° from the incident beam direction, was used for detecting the characteristic fluorescence photons. The horizontal rotation axis ensured a minimised path of the emitted photons inside the specimen, reducing self-absorption effects. Scans of 100 × 100 points with a step size of 0.5 µm were repeated acquired for 64 rotation angles.</p><p>Rats were anesthetized and were intratracheally instilled with SWCNT dispersed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Seven days later the rats were sacrificed. Tissue specimens from the lungs were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and processed routinely for embedding in paraffin. Slices of 40 µm thickness and 3×3 mm 2 cross section were cut from the paraffin blocks and were used for 3D imaging.</p><p>The main results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and presented according in our principal publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> where more information can be found.</p><p>A lung specimen was first screened by a low resolution phase contrast imaging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) and coarse resolution 2D fluorescence scan over the area of about 0.2 × 0.3 mm 2 with step size of 1.8 µm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). Areas with hotspots of iron were apparent in the fluorescence image, and we zoomed into one of these areas for high resolution imaging. A fluorescence data set with step size of 500 nm, and a phase contrast data set with pixel size of 60 nm were recorded in this ROI for laminographic 3D reconstruction. Two slices were chosen for closer inspection as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>, 1e and 1f slice #1 from the lung specimen is seen to contain an excess of iron inside cellular structures.</p><p>Based on the structural images, the size (about 12 µm), location (close to alveolar surface), and shape of the nucleus (single, round) indicate that the cells in question are alveolar macrophages (AM). The fact that excess iron is localized inside some of the AMs indicates the presence of nanotubes within the AMs, confirming the previous finding from electron microscopy that AMs are able to phagocyte most of the nanotubes from the lungs. Figures 1g, 1h and 1i show slice #2 with a part of an alveolar wall structure, showing hotspots of iron inside cellular structures of the wall. Based on the shape of the cells, they can be identified as type-1 pneumocytes and one AM. The iron concentration is more than a factor of 10 lower than in the AMs of slice #1, but still higher than in the surrounding tissue. Although the iron could be endogeneous, comparing the different cells in the lung wall shows that some have a much higher quantity of iron than others. The images suggest for the first time on an in vivo experiment that nanotubes have entered in small amounts inside some of the pneumocytes.</p><p>Nanolaminography thus allowed focusing on a region of the lung that was found to be highly different from the surrounding tissue based on the low resolution fluorescence scan. This approach brings benefits to biology and other applications where the specimen's heterogeneity makes a single ROI unrepresentative of the entire specimen, and where the interesting regions may be far apart from each other. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Imaging of carbon nanotube contamination in a lung tissue. a, Slice from a low resolution electron density volume. b, Low resolution 2D fluorescence image of the specimen showing iron, phosphorus and sulfur distributions.
