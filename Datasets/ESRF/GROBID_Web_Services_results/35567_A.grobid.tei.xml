Although the presence of CaM could be clearly verified better data is needed in order to exploit all the implications this important complex structure can show us. The crystals tested on BM14 clearly showed that using an even stronlger beamline the diffraction can be enhanced. Radiation damage has not been observed so far.

The intensity of the DORIS ring in Hamburg was not sufficient to provide useful data although it could be verified that crystals were protein crystals indeed. The presence of both proteins in the crystals has been verified beforehand by SDS-PAGE analysis revealing clearly single bands for the DAPK and CaM. Making use of the sample changer robot about 20 crystals were checked for their diffraction properties on BM14. Eventually, a 2.5Å data set could be collected and processed. The space group is the primitive orthorombic P2 1 2 1 2 1 with a= 45.5, b=101.9, c=105.3. The space group is similar to the previously solved kinase domain of DAPK but with a significant larger unit cell already indicating the possible presence of CaM. The processing statistics are given in table 1. The structure was solved on site by MR using the entry 1JKL that represents the complete kinase domain of DAPK (residues 1-277). Searching for CaM with various different CaM structures with bound petides did not yield a solution for CaM. After manual rebuilding of the kinase part it was obvious that more of DAPK was visible in the electron density maps. The additional residues 277-318 could be placed manually leading to significant improvement of the phase information. Additional electron density became visible indicating the presence of CaM. After manually building 5 of CaM helices (2 N-terminal and 3 C-terminal) the two Calmodulin lobes could be placed manually. However, the density for many parts of CaM remain poorly and show very high B-Factors indicating partial disorder or still poor very heavily biased phases from</figDesc></figure>
