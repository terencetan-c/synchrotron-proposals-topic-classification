<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The three-dimensional structure of paper is important for many paper properties like absorption, optical properties, permeability, strength and compressibility. A more accurate knowledge of the dependency between the paper components characteristics, paper structure and paper properties can help the paper manufacturers in optimising the structure for certain end use properties. Scanning electron microscopy of cross sections is a common method for structural investigation of paper structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Recently highresolution x-ray microtomography has shown up is a very promising method for making 3D images of paper in microscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The high resolution (0.35 µm) and the automatic reconstruction make this into a feasible method for making 3D representations of real paper samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>See beamline information in Appendix 1. High resolution Frelon camera: 2048 x 2048 pixels</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performed work</head><p>Structure description A series of different papers were chosen for the experiments, see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The first 11 samples were selected to cover a large range in papers structure configurations and tested in the state. Some of the 11 papers were singled out and soaked in water to be studied in wet state, see sample 12-15. In addition one filter paper were soaked in silicone oil before scanning to identify the possibillity to reach a higher absorption for the silicone filled spaces inside the paper structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conductive polymers</head><p>The last 5 samples were performed in co-operation with Prof. Emil Samuelsen at Dept. of Physics (NTNU). His field of interest is electrical conductive polymers, which has to be oriented to be useful for particular applications (e.g. LED). He was interested in studying how these solved polymers (polythiophene) were distributed in the capillaries. For this a filter paper structure were applied. The paper was soaked in polymer/toluene solutions with different polymer concentrations, see sample 17-21 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>After the experimental run in May 2000, the method for reconstructing the images has been established at the Norwegian Pulp and Paper Research Institute. In the end of February 2001 all the reconstruction were finished, see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Using the Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Dynamic Imager we have also converted one of the volumes into a binary format, see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. This was solved by choosing suitable thresholds and filters to determine the phase borders. A procedure to identify all voxels belonging to the same object (fibre) was written and all fibres were "filled" appropriately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Planned and ongoing work</head><p>The results will be compared with data obtained from the paper 3D-structure images obtained by means of controlled grinding and SEM/CLSM. Distribution of pore and fibre dimensions will be recorded from the data, and results will be used to calculate light scattering in paper by means of a light scattering model developed at ACREO, Sweden. In addition the data are used in a co-work with Prof. Silvy at UBI, Portugal, where the goal is to relate the mean cord length in the 3D porous paper structure to paper properties.</p><p>Further on the binary data structures will be used to build a model of the paper structure. This will be used for geometrically visualisation of the paper structure, but the final goal is to make a geometrical model with possibilities for directly modelling of light scattering/absorption and mechanical properties.</p><p>The important last step is to perform the analysis on papers made on a real paper machine with carefully chosen parameters to see how they influence the final paper structure. Such study will be a very important contribution to the knowledge about how to optimise the paper producing process regarding desired end use properties of paper. Beam time for this experimental series will be applied for before the next deadline for submission of applications (September 1, 2001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Planned publications</head><p>The ongoing work together with Prof. Silvy is planned published in the immediate future, and as followup to ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> we have planned to publish the procedure from a reconstructed image to the final binary image. The planned visualisation and modelling will also be included into this series of publications, and finally the planned study on relations between paper producing process and the final paper structure will be published.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="6,116.16,65.60,386.16,573.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
