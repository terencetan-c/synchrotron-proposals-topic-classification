The sample was positioned in the cryomagnet with the beam incidence angle of 30 deg.  The XMCD spectra at iron L 3 edge were shown to have a characteristic three peak structure ascribed to the octahedral and tetrahedral iron 3+ sites. The shape of the XMCD spectra was found to be thickness dependent. A drastic variation of the XMCD spectral shape was observed for the thinnest 2 nm εFe 2 O 3 film. The XMCD spectrum for the thin 2 nm film shows a very pronounced Oh peak at high energies. SHOW SPECTRA.  The magnetization curves have been measured for all the samples in two different ways to look for the traces of the soft and hard magnetic components.  The first and the most traditional way was to set the energy to one of the dichroism maxima (708.5 eV, 709.7 eV, 710.3 eV) and to measure the TEY signal as a function of magnetic field for two opposite photon helicities. This method was shown to produce quite smooth M(H) loops except near zero field where TEY experiences special conditions.  A more advanced method of measuring M(H) loops has been tried. The shape of the L 3 absorption peak in the range 705-715 eV has been measured with two opposite photon helicities and as a function of magnetic field. In this way the post processing analysis can be used to integrate any part of the XMCD spectrum to form a magnetization curve of a particular subalttice.  Surprisingly it has been observed that the M(H) loops measured by TEY XMCD always show a single component shape. If the VSM loop is decomposed into soft and hard component, the hard component is reproduced in TEY XMCD loop while the soft component cannot be observed. To make sure that this behavior is not dependent on which dichroic peak or peaks are used to plot the loop the post processing of the data measured by the second loop measuring technique have been applied.  Any of the main three absorption peaks as well as their combinations always show a hard magnetization behavior. The hard magnetic component coercivity was shown to depend on the measurement temperature and sample thickness in agreement with SQUID/VSM data. The loops are wider for thick samples and lower measurement temperatures.  The most important result is the in 5-50 nm εFe 2 O 3 the hysteresis at no energy position shows an indication of the soft component! This likely means that the soft magnetic component resides in the interface region and is not accessible in the TEY regime.  The idea of the interfacial origin of the soft component is supported by the observation of the soft magnetic behavior in the 2 nm εFe 2 O 3 film. Here we made advantage of the surface sensitive XMCD synchrotron technique as the SQUID/VSM is not sufficiently sensitive to such a thin film.  The reason for soft magnetic behavior at the interface may be the small size of domains (superparamagnetic behavior) or the mixture of εFe 2 O 3 with isostructural GaFe 2 O 3 at the interface due to Ga diffusion during growth.</p><p>Absorption at Ga edge  A negative response at the Ga edge was found in 80 nm αFe 2 O 3 and 40 nm εFe 2 O 3 films. The observed effect is quite unusual and may be related to the light being absorbed on Ga (either in the film or in substrate) and causing decrease of TEY high energy tail of Fe and oxygen.  In a 2 nm εFe 2 O 3 a strong Ga absorption edge has been detected. This can be due to GaN substrate as the 2 nm thickness is semi-transparent from the point of view of TEY. εFe 2 O 3 vs αFe 2 O 3  The XAS spectra of εFe 2 O 3 thick and thin films on GaN have been compared the spectra of somewhat similar αFe 2 O 3 films on GaN. The αFe 2 O 3 phase is close counterpart during growth of εFe 2 O 3 on GaN, so comparison was an important thing to be done, especially of the interface layer.</p><p> The Fe L 23 absorption spectrum was found to be very different for εFe 2 O 3 and αFe 2 O 3 in agreement with the data known from literature. SHOW SPECTRA. A distinctive feature of the αFe 2 O 3 spectrum is the absence of the intensity at the energy corresponding to the Td site.  The O 1s absorption spectrum is very different too for εFe 2 O 3 and αFe 2 O 3 films. SHOW SPECTRA. While the hematite shows a distinct splitting of the O peak at the absorption edge, in εFe 2 O 3 only a broad peak is detected both for thin and thick films. The same broad features are observed for thin εFe 2 O 3 and αFe 2 O 3 nucleation layers suggesting that these layers have nothing to do with αFe 2 O 3 lattice structure.</p><p>Linear dichroism in αFe 2 O 3 films  A preliminary magnetization experiment has been conducted on a single αFe 2 O 3 / GaN film.</p><p> No measurable circular dichroism has been detected in αFe 2 O 3 films at grazing incidence in agreement to the extra weak ferromagnetic nature of hematite.  Interestingly a strong linear dichroism has been detected in αFe 2 O 3 films measured as a difference in absorption of vertically and horizontally polarized light at almost normal incidence. Moreover the XMLD difference showed a pronounced shape dependence on the magnetic field applied in-plane. SHOW SPECTRA.  The absorption shape spectrum variation with field was different for H and V polarized light. In high applied field the peak and the satellite shift in energy towards each other as the polarization is changed from H to V. In zero field the effect disappears. This suggests that the effect is not as simple as the non-linear dependence of the TEY on the applied field and has a true linear dichroism nature.  We had no time to measure temperature dependence of the XMLD effect that is expected to be switched on/off at Morin temperature of hematite.  Further investigation of this effect would be desirable. Above Morin transition hematite is a non collinear antiferromagnet. Therefore it exhibits a small ferrimagnetic moment perpendicular to the large antiferromagnetic moment. The applied field is able to rotate the ferromagnetic moment in the basal plane of hematite and therefore rotates the antiferromagnetic moment as well. The antiferromagnetic moment can be sensed by XMLD.</p></div>		</body>
