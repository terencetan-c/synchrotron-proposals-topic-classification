<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Among the quasi infinity of synthetic molecular edifices, the hexacyanometallate family is well known in transition metal chemistry to behave with remarkable electronic properties. It is also an interesting example of building block chemistry with structurally defined subfamilies. From structure control, electronic delocalization may be tuned up or down in order to design systems that exhibit a large variety of physical properties. This project aims to fully describe the building block chemistry of the actinide cyanometallates and thiocyanometallates and to assess the electronic properties of the actinide-cyano bond using a combination of X-ray spectroscopic and theoretical chemical tools. For the f elements, the lanthanide hexacyanometallate derivatives have been reported extensively, whereas the actinide family is much less present in the literature.</p><p>Since the beginning of this project, five series of synthesis have been performed. They have been performed in mid acidic aqueous solution at room temperature, except for the third series in DMF. In most cases, powders have been obtained. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the complexes obtained in this task. We have already reported on the results of series 4 (report of the 06/07/2010) with the Am and Cf adducts. We would like to report here on series 3.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) an interesting stability of the An IV /Fe III form instead of An IV /Fe II form in the absence of DMF. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> exemplifies the two edge fitting methodology from the Lu III /Fe III /DMF model compound. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>For EXAFS data analysis, an original parameterized fitting procedure based on the two edge fit has been implemented and tested on model compound Lu III /Fe III /DMF ([Lu III (DMF) 4 (H 2 O) 3 (Fe III (CN) 6 )].H 2 O) described by Mullica.[1] The model compound Lu III /Fe III /DMF ([Lu III (DMF) 4 (H 2 O) 3 (Fe III (CN) 6 )].H 2 O) has been selected to test the parameterized fitting procedure. In this complex, the lutetium atom is eight-coordinated to four DMF groups, three water molecules and only one ferricyanide motif. It contains one "Fe-C-N-Lu" link, therefore of very weak intensity. In order to test our fitting procedure, both iron K edge and Lu L III edge of Lu III /Fe III /DMF have been adjusted using a parameterization of the metrical parameters at both edges. In the crystal structure of Lu III /Fe III /DMF, the Fe-C-N angle is equal to 177 ° and can be considered nearly linear while the Lu-N-C angle (noted θ) is equal to 164°. Similarly, the Th(IV) adduct (H 5 O 2 )[Th(IV)(DMF) 5 (H 2 O)] 2 [Fe(III)(CN) 6 ] 3 as well as Np(IV) and Pu(IV) adducts (but not crystallized) have been prepared. As confirmed by XANES measurements (at both actinide and Fe edges) they show (except for the Np adduct, as detailed in Table</figDesc></figure>

The Fe K edge was recorded at the SSRL synchrotron. The best fit metrical parameters of Th IV /Fe III /DMF are in very good agreement with the crystallographic data. EXAFS data : Th-N = 2.59 Å (σ 2 =0.006 Å), C-N = 1.17 Å (σ 2 =0.010 Å), Fe-C = 1.92 Å (σ 2 =0.009 Å) ; XRD data : Th-N = 2.578 Å, C-N = 1.149 Å, Fe-C = 1.923 Å. We are currently working on the adjustment of the Pu IV /Fe III /DMF adduct. One of the objectives is to understand the role of the DMF in the structure in preventing the formation of the ferrocyanide adduct. In parallel, we have started the investigation of the actinide thiocyanide adducts. Crystallographic parameters have already been obtained from lanthanide (Nd and Lu) and thorium [NBu 3 ] 3 [Th(NCS) 4 (NO 3 ) 3 ] adducts. A first attempt in the synthesis of the Am(III) thiocyanate equivalent has failed and will be the object of the next beam time period.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,80.92,327.16,433.44,177.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
