<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal for this project was to explore the effect of variation of different atomic groups on the structure of a two dimensional perovskite with the chemical formula MA2(BA/EA/GA/PEA)n-1Pbn(I/Br/Cl)3n+1. A mix of monovalent cations is employed as spacers with BA/EA (n-butylammonium/ Ethylammonium), BA/GA (nbutylammonium/ Guanidinium) or BA/PEA (n-butylammonium/ phenethylammonium). The structural modification of the 2D perovskites will permit to achieve optimum efficiency and color rendering for application in LEDs. Preliminary results on temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal clear changes in the PL spectra at lower temperatures illustrating different exciton binding energies as well as a differing fine structure of the excitons. Until now, the origin of the changes in the T-dependent photoluminescence spectra remains unclear. Moreover, a higher efficiency has been observed for LEDs made of mixed cations hinting to a better charge transportation through highly oriented layers relative to the substrate compared to the single cation-based devices. Specifically, we focused on the effect of two different groups: cation and, anion groups. These parameters can change the packing of the atomic groups in the system and hence their optoelectronic properties. GIWAXS experiments were performed at the Dutch-Belgian Beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) station BM26B in Grenoble (12 keV, l = 1.033 Å). The 2D scattering patterns were recorded using a PILATUS 1M Dectris detector. We have used a variable incident angle ranging from 0.17° to 1.8° for the measurements. Next, we used a Linkam stage to control the temperature ranging from 400 K down to 90K. The 2D scattering patterns were recorded at each temperature (every 25 K) to probe the effect of temperature on the arrangement of the interlayer cations in the structure of the materials and their structural phases. In this study, several parameters were considered: 1. The change of the halide group from I to mix of I/Cl and Br; 2. The change of the organic cation to EA, GA or PEA with different concentration ratios compared to MA; 3. Measurements at different angle of incidence; 4. Measurement for intermediate concentrations of the mixed organic cations at different temperatures.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates examples of the 2D scattering patterns of three different samples with different halide groups (Br, I and I/Cl) at fixed incidence angle (left colloumn) as well as different cation substitution groups (Ea and Gua) at room temperatures. As can be seen in the initial analysis, the structure changes upon halide and cation substitution corroborating with the PL measurements. We are working on the analysis of the body of the results obtained during this measurement time and the initial analysis is promising. To summarize, not only the scientific results obtained made this time extremely fruitful but also, I benefited from gaining more experience with the setup and measurement technique as well as the data analysis.
