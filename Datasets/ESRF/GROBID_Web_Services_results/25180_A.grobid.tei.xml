<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-situ XAFS measurements at fuel cell catalysts in methanol operation</head><p>Situation:</p><p>A special in-situ fuel cell has been developed to enable X-ray absorption measurements during operation using either pure hydrogen or 1 M aqueous methanol solution as anode feed. The main aim of these investigations is to monitor changes in the structure of the carbon-supported 20 wt.% Pt-Ru (1:1) anode catalyst with potential.</p><p>Preliminary investigations have been carried out at beamline X1 at Hasylab, Hamburg, in transmission geometry <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. However, it was not possible to obtain spectra at the Ru K-edge because of the strong absorption of the platinum present in the electrode. This has been a severe drawback for the measurements, since data at both edges were to be recorded simultaneously.</p><p>Consequently, another approach has been adopted for the in-situ fuel cell experiments at beamline BM29 at the ESRF. The fuel cell was modified with a Be window at the front plate to allow for measurements in fluorescence geometry. It was planned to measure the Pt L 3 -edge and the Ru K-edge in turn with increasing potential in both hydrogen and methanol operation. Beamline BM29 is especially suited for these experiments due to the excellent fluorescence detector available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements and drawbacks:</head><p>Five different membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared for the XAS measurements: two commercially-available ones, two in-house prepared MEAs with a commercial Pt-Ru alloy catalyst and one MEA with separate Pt and Ru phases in the anode catalyst. The first four were operated in-situ with hydrogen (and partly methanol) and spectra taken at different potentials at the respective Pt and Ru edge, while the last one could only be measured ex-situ due to problems in operation. In figures 1 and 2, spectra recorded ex-situ at the Pt (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and Ru edge (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), respectively, and in operation at maximum load are compared. They already differ significantly in E space, and a draft analysis using WinXAS reveals differences in R space as well. However, a more detailed evaluation of the data (fitting of the EXAFS and analysis of the AXAFS features) will be carried out in due course. 21,8 22,0 22,2 22,4 22,6 22,8 23,0 23,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2 ex-situ in-situ max load energy [keV] Fig. 2. Comparison of the spectra in E space; black = ex-situ, red = at full load in hydrogen operation, Ru Kedge Comparing the Ru edge at different potentials in hydrogen operation, no significant differences were observed (fig. 3), while the spectra at the Pt edge exhibit different features at first glance (see e.g. white-line intensities, fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In this case, fitting of the spectra will provide further information.</p><p>21,8 22,0 22,2 22,4 22,6 22,8 23,0 23,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2 ex-situ in-situ max load in-situ 4A in-situ 2.5A energy [keV] 11,4 11,5 11,6 11,7 11,8 11,9 -0,2 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2 1,4 1,6 ex-situ in-situ max load in-situ 4A in-situ 2.5A energy [keV] Fig. 4. Comparison of the Pt spectra in E space at different potentials; black = ex-situ, red = at full load, green = 4A, blue = 2.5A in hydrogen operation, Ru K-edge Despite these interesting findings, several drawbacks occurred during the experiments: a) difficulties to record the Pt L 3 -edge in fluorescence due to a strongly-absorbing water film on the Be window (fig. 5), b) Ru dissolution at potentials &gt;700 mV, which crystallizes on top of the Pt 'masking' it for further measurements.</p><p>Due to these limitations, only very noisy spectra were taken in methanol operation, since the amount of liquid in the cell hampered the measurements.</p><p>11,4 11,5 11,6 11,7 11,8 11,9 0,000 0,001 0,002 0,003 0,004 0,005 0,006 0,007 0,008 ex-situ in-situ max load in-situ 4A in-situ 2.5A energy [keV]</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Spectra at the Pt L 3 -edge with increasing potential and increasing amount of water in the fuel cell</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ideas for improvement:</head><p>1) Pt should be measured in transmission and Ru in fluorescence, both should be measured in turns at increasing potentials (up to Ru dissolution).</p><p>2) The cell should be modified to reduce the water in the gas flow field and in front of the Be window.</p><p>This can be done by using a graphite flow field with serpentine flow (creating a pressure drop in the cell to get rid of excess water). In addition, a small 'reservoir' could be cut into the graphite plate below the window to trap the water in there.</p><p>We will apply for additional beamtime at BM29 for the next period. With the improvements listed above it should be possible to enhance the quality of the data and thus enable the online-monitoring of the structure of different catalysts in operation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
