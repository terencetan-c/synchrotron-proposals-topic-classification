<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental <ref type="bibr">:</ref> The solubility and molecular structure of platinum and gold in sulfur-bearing aqueous solutions were examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Pt L3-edge (~11.6 keV) and Au L3-edge (~11.9 keV), both in transmission and fluorescence mode with a Si(220) double crystal monochromator and 7 Si(660) or Ge(660) crystals placed in a Roland circle geometry for high energy resolution fluorescence measurements, at temperatures (T) from 200 to 400°C and pressures (P) 600-700 bar, using the FAME high T-P autoclave that enables simultaneous measurement of both the total dissolved metal concentration and its atomic environment in the fluid <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. The internal cell is composed of a glassy-carbon tube with two pistons equipped with Viton seals. The source of Au and Pt in experiments were Au and Pt metal foils. The 2 sources of sulfur were: i) K2S2O3 whose dissolution in H2O(±HCl, ±NaOH) at T &gt;200°C yields sulfate (HSO4 -and SO4 2-), hydrogen sulfide (H2S and HS -) and the trisulfur ion (S3 -) as the major S aqueous forms and ii) NaHS yielding only hydrogen sulfide ligands (HS -and H2S). Their concentrations may accurately be quantified using the thermodynamic properties of these species and recent in-situ Raman spectroscopy measurements in similar systems <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The choice of the experimental conditions in thiosulfate bearing systems was carefully made in order to maximize the concentration of S3 -in the system and thus to better elucidate its effect of Pt speciation. A total of seven experiments have been performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results from the S-bearing systems with Au :</head><p>Two experiments could be performed at 350°C and 700 bar on Au-saturated thiosulfate solutions at acidic (4.5) and alkaline (7.5) pH at which Au(HS)S3 -and Au(HS)2 -, respectively, are the dominant Au species according to recent work <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. It was found that measured Au solubility in both experiments is in excellent agreement with the predicted solubility <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. The high-resolution XANES spectra exhibit detectable differences, which are confirmed by ab-initio simulations of the XANES spectra using the FDMNES code and optimized structures of both complexes obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. Thus the HR-XANES provides the first direct confirmation for the existence of the Au(HS)S3 -complex in acidic and S3 --rich fluids, as was hypothesized in previous studies using less direct methods based on analyses of total gold solubility changes with increasing S3 -concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results from the S-bearing systems with Pt :</head><p>Four experiments could be performed at 300°C and 600 bar on Pt-saturated thiosulfate solutions at acidic (4.4) and near-neutral (5.5) pH, and on Pt-saturated hydrogen sulfide solutions at alkaline (8.4) pH. The use of the HR-XANES mode yields both a 2-fold increase of the amplitude of XANES resonances and their energy resolution compared to the spectra in transmission mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Thus, the energy of the maximum is precisely defined, making it possible to clearly identify significant differences between the maximum white-line energy values of Pt(II)-S (PtS, 11567.0 eV) and Pt(IV)-S [(NH4)2Pt IV (S5)3], 11568.0 eV) solid references (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The comparison of these references with our Pt solutions at high T-P shows that all solutions have a similar energy position as the Pt(II)-S reference (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Furthermore, the good quality of the EXAFS spectra of a 2 molal thiosulfate solution make it possible to derive two information: (i) a mean Pt-S bond length of ~2.30 Å, close to that in the Pt(II)-S reference PtS, but different from that in the Pt(IV)-S solids which have Pt-S bond lengths longer than 2.34 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) ; (ii) a coordination number between 3 and 4. Thus, a square planar geometry of the 1 st coordination shell of, as for PtS, is highlighted <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions &amp; perspectives:</head><p>First, our exploratory experiments showed that when S3 -has higher concentrations than HS -in the pH range 4.5&lt;pH&lt;5.5, the dominant Pt oxidation state in the Pt-S complexes is +II and not +IV. It is an important finding because, while the solid phase Pt IV S2 is the thermodynamically stable mineral in nature at the redox conditions of the SO4 2--H2S coexistence, in aqueous solution the Pt +II redox state is stable. In hydrogen sulfide dominated solutions (NaHS), Pt II S(s) is the thermodynamically stable mineral in nature, and Pt+II redox state is also found to be stable at alkaline pH. Second, the HR-XANES spectra of Pt do not show features that would be clearly indicative of the presence of 2 nd shell S atoms, as in in the solid reference [(NH4)2Pt IV (S5)3] or in Pt-S3 -complexes. Thus, direct spectroscopic evidence of the existence of Pt-S3 -complexes is yet lacking. Our near-future experiments will be focused on H2S/HS --bearing fluids, to more accurately measure both Pt solubility (from the accurately calibrated fluorescence signal) and local structure (via acquisition of high-quality EXAFS spectra using the 30-element Canberra detector at FAME beamline).  <ref type="bibr">et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">.

Pt LIII-edge XANES for the two solid reference compounds, Pt II S (left) and [(NH4)2Pt IV (S5)3] (right), at 25°C and 1 bar. The spectacular improvement in resolution in HR-XANES mode (red), compared to 'classical' XANES spectra (blue), enables precise determination of the white-line maximum energies of the Pt(II)-S (11567.0 eV) and Pt(IV)-S (11568.0 eV) references. The main features present in both references are marked by vertical dashed lines as A and B, and the features marked as C and D are because of the high cristallinity of the PtS reference.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,139.40,230.45,316.35,186.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
