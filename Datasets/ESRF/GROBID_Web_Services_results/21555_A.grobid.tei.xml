This project has therefore been abandoned.</p><p>At the time of beam-time allocation, no crystals of pectinases were available for measurement. Therefore we attempted to collect data for a family 9 glycoside hydrolase from the thermophilic organism Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, which crystallizes as extremely thin plates and for which diffraction has only been observed to 6-8 A resolution at conventional synchrotron beamlines. After trial of at least ten crystals, one was found that gave weak but ordered diffraction in all directions. A data set was collected which allowed determination of the space group (P2 1 2 1 2) and cell (a=85.0, b=129.7, and c=48.6). The data set was collected to a maximum resolution of 3 A, with Rsym=0.154 and a completeness of 99.4%  [1] Eckert, K., Zielinski, F., Lo Leggio, L. and Schneider, E.

Molecular replacement using the closest homologue for which 3-D structure is available (C. thermocellum CelD, PDB ID: 1clc) gave a convincing solution with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. However, refinement has proven problematic because of low resolution and limited identity between model and target (25-30%).Within the theme of carbohydrate-modifying enzymes, previous data collected at the ESRF by our group has recently proved fruitful. A native data set collected at ID14-4 of Aspergillus aculeatus rhamnogalacturonan lyase[3]  has been used to solve the structure by MIR to 1.5 Å resolution (McDonough et al, in preparation). The structure represents a novel fold with three-domain all beta structure, in which all domains are likely to participate in the formation of the active site. A data set collected also at ID14-4 of a maltose O-acetyltransferase crystal to 2.15 Å resolution [4] has also been used for final refinement of the structure(Lo Leggio et  al., in preparation). The structure presents the expected trimeric left-handed parallel beta helix fold (Fig.1).</figDesc></figure>
