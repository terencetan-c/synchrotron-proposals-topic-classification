<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental setup. The experiment was performed at the ID13 nanofocus hutch (EH-3) with the monochromatic beam focused to a spot of ~200(h)*150(v) nm. Ag-behenate was used as a calibrant. Images were acquired with a Medipix pixel detector that combines a fast readout with a high sensitivity. Samples were in this case deposited on silicon nitride membranes and dried, since the measurements were performed at room temperature. We raster scan the silicon nitride membranes to localize the single crystals. Samples: Eosinophils. The sample preparation is identical to that of the experimental report MX-1192.</p><p>Briefly, eosinophils were isolated from healthy donors/hypereosinophilic patients and granules containing crystals were extracted from the cells with established methods (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), frozen in a sucrose/ethylene glycol solution and defrosted just before the measurements directly at the ESRF in Grenoble. Additionally, crystalline cores were extracted from granules upon treatment with a mild detergent (Triton 0.1%), spun through a sucrose cushion and frozen in a sucrose/ethylene glycol solution. Both granules and cores were thawed at the ESRF, extensively washed in water to remove any salt, resuspended in water and deposited on silicon nitride membranes (Silson). To concentrate the samples further, multiple layers were deposited and dried on each membrane. Bacillus thuringiensis. Bacillus thuringiensis cells containing crystalline deposits of the Cry1A and Cry3A proteins were used. Wild type strains of B.thuringiensis produce crystalline inclusions of proteins that appear to be natural toxin to pests (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). They appear as a well ordered crystals with approximate dimensions of ~1µm across (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Current variants of B.thuringiensis were genetically modified and over-produced Cry1A and Cry3A proteins, resulting in increased crystal sizes. For the experiment, B.thuringiensis cells were mounted onto MiTeGen micro mounts.</p><p>X-ray data collection: X-ray diffraction images were collected in a mesh scanning mode, with steps of 500 nm to few microns. Over 50,000 diffraction images were recorded. Such a technique was applied since it is not possible to visualize the granules or crystals using the in-line light microscope due to their small size.</p><p>Therefore, we had to use the approach to raster scan large areas of the membranes to identify points of interest. Images of static samples were collected and processed. Reflections were detected with Fit2D software.</p><p>Preliminary results and conlusions: Eosinophils. Remarkable progress was made in characterizing diffraction from eosinophil nanocrystals. In this experimental session we examined two kind of samples, intact granules and isolated crystals. The latter, had a tendency to show powder diffraction, most likely due to the aggregation of several crystals in the drying process. The resolution limit of the powder diffraction patterns extended to approximately 15 Å. The intact granules measured in the last two shifts showed a better dispersion, and single crystal diffraction was attained. We speculate that the granules are protecting the crystals from dehydrating during the hours required to complete the experiment at ambient temperature and help to avoid co-aggreation of different crystals. This information is valuable to us because future experiments can be focused on the granules, rather than cores. Two of the best single-crystal diffraction patterns from eosinophil granules are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  Data analysis reveals that crystal parameters are well correlated between the purified cores and the granules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). There is agreement in the Bragg spacings and intensities as shown in  The diffraction patterns provide us with further evidence that the naturally occuring crystals of MBP made by the eosinophil have different parameters than those obtained from the recombinantly express MBP protein. In Fig. 4, we illustrate the poor correlation between the two-theta values of the reflections recorded from the granules (blue) and those collected from the recombinant protein (orange). The results suggest that the crystal</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. A.

Preliminary data analysis for the B.thuringiensis diffraction patterns allowed us to estimate the unit cell parameters. For indexing and Bravais lattice determination only reflections with I/σ &gt;5 were considered. Low resolution reflections were not used for the purpose of analysis, since shapes of reflections showed a large variability. Additionally, small positional deviations resulted in large differences in measured reflection angles; therefore only reflections with resolution higher than 30Å were used (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>Possible unit cells were fitted to reflect the data with allowed dimensions smaller than 500Å, and the obtained values were: a=374 Å, b=75 Å, c=351 Å, β=109 (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Achieving X-ray diffraction data from crystalline deposits within B.thuringiensis cells validates that the chosen methodology can be applied for studying material in cells however the diffracting quality of the eosinophil crystal exceeded the B.thuringiensis samples that will therefore not be studied in further detail. </p></div>			</div>
