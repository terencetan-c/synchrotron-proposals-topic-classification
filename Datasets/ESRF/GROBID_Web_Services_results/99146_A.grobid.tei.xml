<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>XRD characterization of Pt structural properties and its correlation with spin orbit interaction in magnetic epitaxial stacks Nevertheless, the role of the cristallographic direction in the spin conversion is still under debate,as is demonstrated by the wide range of spin generation efficiency values experimentally obtained by different techniques in the same material. It appears that in such systems the role of the metal/ferromagnet interface is as important as the bulk material due the Rashba-Bishkoff spin orbit coupling. Thus, although the promising technological perspectives, the control of the spin generation remains under study and the real efficiency of crystalline Pt for spin generation is still unknown. Through this thoughtful structural study, and combining it with mentioned ST-FMR, SP-FMR and SSE measurementswe aimed at understanding the relation between the crystalline structure of Pt and its efficiency for spin current generation.</p><p>Experiment results: For this experiment we were granted 12 shifts of beam time, which was enough to characterize our set of samples. We performed XRD diffraction measurements in Co/Pt(111) stacks with different Pt thickness (t Pt =5, 10, 15 and 20 nm) and a fixed Co thickness of 5 nm. The experiment was performed at the Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction experimental station at ambient conditions, taking advantage of access to a wide section of the reciprocal space. The complete set of measurements included low angle reflectivity, θ-2θ scans in symmetric and asymmetric geometries, 360 rocking scans around Pt and Co reflections and rods at different substrate position. Additionally, reciprocal space maps (RSM) were recorded, taking advantage of the bidimensional detector installed at the beamtime. An incident angle of 0.5 degrees and a beam energy of 25 keV (λ=0.4954 Å) was used. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> summarized the structural characterization performed during the experiment in Co/Pt(111) bilayers with different Pt thickness. The results proved the growth of completely (111)-textured Pt and Co films. Considering in-plane structural properties, we observed a high degree of mosaicity, so that intensity never dissapears when rocking the sample around different crystallographic axis although maximum intensity is observed for certain angles. Main preferential direction corresponds with a 30 degrees rotation so that lattice mismatch between the substrate an the Pt film is minimized. Second family of reflections corresponds with an axis-on-axis growth. The Co film grows axis-on-axis on Pt, translating the same symmetry and crystallographic properties of the Pt film. Thus, the following epitaxial relations are observed: Al 2 O 3 [112 � 0]||Pt[011 � ]||Co[[011 � ] (0º), Al 2 O 3 [112 � 0]||Pt[112 � ]||Co[[112 � ] (30º), Al 2 O 3 [112 � 0]||Pt[01 � 1]||Co[01 � 1] (180º) and Al 2 O 3 [112 � 0]||Pt[1 � 1 � 2]||Co[[1 � 1 � 2] (210º). The appareance of Kiessig fringes even at high diffraction angle indicates the formation of extremely flat interfaces, which favors the coupling between both structures. The high in-plane mosaicity of the films indicates a relaxed growth of Pt and Co structrures, presenting a bulk-like lattice parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation with the previous work:</head><p>In order to unravel the dependence between spin to charge interconversion efficiency in Pt and crystallographic directions, identical samples were processed by standard optical lithography. Microscope images of patterned Co/Pt slabs for the two crystallographic directions are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>. In order to perform SP-FMR measurements, a coplanar waveguide (CPW) antenna is integrated in the last step of lithography and insulated from the sample by a SiO 2 200 nm capping layer. During the measurement a GHz radio-frequency (rf) current is injected in antenna, which generates a rf field (h rf ) along the long axis of the sample, while a static in-plane magnetic field (H dc ) is also applied parallel to the crystallographic direction chosen. The precession of the magnetization leads to the creation of a pure transverse spin current J S that is injected from the Co to the Pt layer. Due to the inverse spin hall effect (ISHE), the spin current is converted into a charge current in the Pt and detected by measuring the output voltage. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref> shows the voltage owing to spin pumping mesured as a function of the applied magnetic field at different frequencies for the sample with a 20 nm thick Pt layer.</p><p>By these experiments we determined the resonant magnetic field (H res ), the linewidth (ΔH) and the spin pumping voltage (V SP-FMR ). Consequently, we obtained the effective saturation magnetization (M eff ), the Gilbert magnetic damping (α) and the charge current (I C ) of the stack. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>  The results are in agreement with previous reports in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and do not reveal significant differences between both crystallographic axis. Nevertheless, when analyzing the evolution of the spin hall angle (θ SH ), as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>, an anisotropic behavior between the two crystallographic directions nearly to 20% can be clearly appreciated. This parameter was obtained considering the effective spin current flowing in the Pt layer by the following relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐼𝐼 𝐶𝐶 = V SP-FMR R = 𝑤𝑤𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝜃𝜃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐽𝐽 𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 tanh � 𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 2𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 �<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where w=10 µm is the width of the device, 𝐽𝐽 𝑆𝑆 𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the effective spin current density, 𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 is the spin diffusion length and 𝜃𝜃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 the effective spin Hall angle. Thus, θ SH =0.158 ± 0.02 and 0.124 ± 0.02 values are estimated from (1) for Al 2 O 3 [1-100] and Al 2 O 3 [11-20] directions respectively. These values correlate fairly well with previous results in the literature for high spin hall angles in FM/Pt bilayers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and further support the recently published study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that the anisotropy arises due to the specific crystallographic orientation of epitaxial Pt. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Iciar Arnay*, Adrián Gudín*, Rubén Guerrero, Paolo Perna, Julio Camarero IMDEA Nanoscience institure, C/Faraday 9 28049 Madrid, Spain Alberto Anadón* Institut Jean-Lagmoir, Campus Artem, 2 allée André Guinier, 54011 Nancy, France Report: Proposal summary and main objectives: The aim of the proposal was to characterized by means of X-Ray diffraction (XRD) the structural properties of epitaxial Co(111)/Pt(111) bilayer prepared onto (0001)-oriented Al 2 O 3 substrates and capped by Al. The structural properties of the Pt layer are related with its efficiency of charge to spin interconversionWe have characterized this interconversion by spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR), spin pumping FMR (SP-FMR) and Spin Seebeck measurements along different crystallographic directions. Pt is one of the most effective materials in terms of spin current generation, being therefore of huge technological interest.</figDesc></figure>
