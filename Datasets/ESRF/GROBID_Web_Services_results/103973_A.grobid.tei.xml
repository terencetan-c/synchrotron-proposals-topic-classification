<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment involved performing simultaneous SAXS and WAXS measurements on a variety of thermoplastic copolyester block copolymers. The primary aim was to evaluate the evolution of morphologies in these segmented copolymers during different phase transformations. The primary architecture of the copolymers is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, in which there are alternating hard, semi-crystalline segments and soft, low Tg segments in a multi-block type architecture.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Cartoon representation of the multiblock copolymers investigated in this experiment.</p><p>We had a variety of different copolymers, differing in both the molecular identity of the hard block (PET vs. PBT) and the composition (i.e., weight/mass percent of the respective blocks). Using this diverse sample set, we explored various different morphological/phase transitions. Initially, we investigated the temperature dependence of phases, heating and cooling the samples while capturing SAXS/WAXS frames. From this we are able to identify both phase sizes (i.e., crystalline domain size) and also approximate melting temperatures coinciding with the morphological transitions. We are looking for the different transitions in copolymers with different compositions, and also different backbone type. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows examples of data obtained from these heating/cooling experiments, where a distinct difference can be seen in the transition temperature from copolymers containing either PET or PBT hard segments. In addition to the heating/cooling, we also performed a series of SAXS/WAXS measurements on the same sample set during mechanical/tensile deformation. The in situ deformation experiments revealed the changes in morphologies during deformation, an imporant indicator of performance in these engineering materials. Crystalline lamellae befome deformed on a mesoscale and rearrange or reorient themselves upon deformation, which has a dramatic influence on the mechanical performance. This relationship can now be revealed from the data captured during this experiment. We plan on publishing this data in at least two separate publications, which we are working on now. We plan follow up experiments based on the valuable data captured, using different copolymers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
