<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>a)l8' June Cryostat and table set-up Tests with vanadium foil Beam Alignment Criostat purge b)19" June Experiments at RT with samples of 10mM aqueous solutions of vanadium complexes. The observed shifts in the pre-edge peak of the spectrum indicate that there is an effect of radiation damage (reduction of samples). Interferences with cromium were also observed mainly because we were not using an energy dispersive multidetector element but a multidetector element with no energy resolution (photodiode). The,set-up of the cryostat and the liquid He transfer line were initiated in order to run experiments at low temperature. It was not possible to have the transfer line operational because it had been replaced by the manufacturer in a different size. c)20* June Set-up of an liquid Nitrogen transfer line. The system was working fine with the Na line. Problems arose with the cooling of the sample: Although several procedures for the cooling of the samples had been tried ( liquid nitrogen and a salt/ice bath) diffraction peaks were always present in the spectrum and could not be disdrirninated by the detector. In the future the samples will have to be cooled with dry ice and ethanol. d)21" June It was not possible to run experiments because we could not change the gap on the undulator due to general ESRF failure. e)22"d June Experiments at RT were performed in several conditions in order to get information about radiation damage for the next experiments. The quick scan acquisition mode was used and some experiments were performed with a high degree of resolution in energy in order to make possible the observation of 1eV shifts in the pre-edge peak.</p><p>As it may be concluded we were not able to perform the expected experiments and we think that the proposal with this project has to be resubmitted.</p><p>However we also think that the experiments with our compounds were useful for us in what concerns the next experiments and also for the set up of this new beamline.</p><p>During our stay we had the opportunity: a) To contact with the scientists of the beam line and exchange ideas about the experiments and instrumentation. b) To get acquainted with the possibilities of the beamline in loco in particular the possibility of using the quickscan acquisition mode that we think will be very important to analyze our samples. c) To test our samples in what concerns radiation damage at room temperature.</p><p>Finally we would like to add that apart the assistance we got from the beamline scientists and technicians we also received very good support in the Chemistry Laboratory.</p><p>25" August 1998</p></div>		</body>
