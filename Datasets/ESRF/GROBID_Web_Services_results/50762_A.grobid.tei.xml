Solution based techniques such as small-angle scattering seem to be a promising strategy as an alternative to x-ray crystallography; however these still rely on successful reconstitution of membrane proteins into bilayer-mimicking carriers. One such carrier is the so called nanodisc, a 10-14 nm sized phospholipid bilayer stabilized by two amphipathic protein belts. Structurally well-defined, this nanodisc system has shown a great potential as a carrier for structural studies of membrane proteins using a combined SAXS/SANS approach together with computational modeling techniques developed in our group <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. The present report shows the latest step in the development of the nanodisc system where we have constructed a selectively deuterated and contrast minimized stealth version of the discs in close collaboration with the Deuteration Laboratory at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble. Our long term goal is to use these stealth discs as neutron-undetectable carriers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) which can function as a platform for low-resolution structural studies of membrane proteins in solution using SANS together with already available data analysis tools (3). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C B A</head><p>The stealth nanodiscs were assembled using deuterated amphipathic belts (MSP1D1) together with selectively deuterated PC-lipids, developed in collaboration with the D-Lab, ILL, Grenoble. The theoretical deuteration levels needed for full "invisibility" of the discs, which vary for the different parts of the nanodisc complex and even differ for the different parts of the phospholipid bilayer alone, were achieved through biosynthesis in a genetically modified E-coli strain grown in deuterated media. The deuteration levels and localization on the lipid molecule were regulated during lipid synthesis through careful design of the bacterial growth conditions. The assembly of specifically deuterated stealth nanodiscs and their behaviour in both H 2 O and D 2 O, were investigated using SAXS as the main focus of the present experiment. In addition, several membrane proteins reconstituted into regular hydrogenated discs were investigated to determine their characteristics prior to further incorporation into the stealth discs. The obtained SAXS data of the stealth nanodiscs in H 2 O showed a very distinct curve characteristic of the nanodisc system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>) (4). The resulting p(r) function indicated a maximum size of approximately 120 Å for the discs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>) consistent what has previously been observed for similarly prepared hydrogenated nanodiscs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. A mathematical model for the nanodisc system derived previously in our group was also fitted to the experimental data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> black) (4) and confirmed that the SAXS data were fully consistent with nanodiscs having the same structure as has previously been observed (1, 2). The SAXS analysis was followed by a SANS contrast variation study in aqueous buffer to determine the match point and internal homogeneity of the scattering length density within the carriers. The SANS data, collected at the FRMII in Munich showed a decrease in scattering intensity with increasing level of D 2 O in solution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>) (4). For each contrast measurement the forward scattering was determined by the indirect Fourier transform method and the scattering data normalized by sample concentration (4). The match point was then determined by fitting a second order polynomial to the forward scattering plotted as a function of volume fraction of D 2 O in the buffer solution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>) (4). A minimum in the overall I(q) can be seen giving a match point at 100% D 2 O, however absolute zero is not reached. This can be due to inhomogeneities in the nanodisc components arising from a small distribution in deuteration of the phospholipid bilayer and possible inhomogeneity arising from the deuteration in membrane scaffold protein. However the intensity decreases to a level comparable to that of the experimental background making the signal negligible when seen in combination with a possible incorporated protein (4). We therefore see this as a very promising new development for structural investigation of membrane proteins and plan to follow up with studies on several membrane proteins incorporated into the aforementioned contrast-matched stealth carriers. q [Å -1 ] 0.01 0.1 1 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 A B</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1 -(A) Membrane protein (green) and phospholipid bilayer (blue) in the standard contrast situation.
