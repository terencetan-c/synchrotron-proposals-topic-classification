<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The build-up of eumelanin particles and their final structure was investigated in pure water and in aqueous MES buffer under various conditions. A biomimetic synthesis starting with L-Dopa was used in all cases. The enzyme tyrosinase served as catalyst for the oxidation of L-Dopa, which is accompanied by the consumption of dissolved oxygen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of particles at final state</head><p>Eumelanin particles synthesized in MES buffered aqueous solution at pH values of 6.2 and 7.2 were characterized after completion of the process. Since during the formation reaction of eumelanin dissolved oxygen is consumed, an experiment was performed at ambient O2 content and another one at a saturated O2 level at both pH values respectively. All four samples were measured at detector distances of 1 and 10 m. Evaluation yielded radii of gyration (Rg) given in Table 1. In case of the sample prepared at a pH of 6.2 under oxygen saturation aggregation of the particles occurred, which prohibited an evaluation of Rg. Kratky plots indicate a compact structure of the particles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-resolved experiments on particle formation</head><p>The particle formation was observed over time in water at pH = 4 and in MES buffer at pH = 6.2. Figures Table 1: Radii of gyration determined with Guinier-plot Sample pH 6.2 pH 7.2 pH 7.2 O2 Rg / nm 36 17 20 2-4 show a selection of intermediate states observed during the respective time-resolved SAXS experiment. Firstly, particle formation was investigated in pure water. Previous light scattering experiments indicated a fast particle growth ending up with spherical particles with a diameter close to 400 nm. The goal of the time-resolved SAXS experiments was to observe intermediate stages of the growing eumelanin particles at two different O2 contents, one corresponding to the state equilibrated with ambient air and one corresponding to the state saturated with O2. Measurements carried out with ambient O2 content are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and measurements of samples saturated with O2 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Initially, a sample detector distance of 3 m was used (upper plot of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and 3). Directly after the beginning of the reaction particles were detected. However, the scattering signal did not significantly increase with time and the q-regime was not suitable to determine the size of the particles. Therefore, additional experiments were carried out at a sample-detector distance of 10 m (bottom plot of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and 3). For both oxygen concentrations the scattering signal was rather weak, even after several hours of the reaction. Based on previous light scattering experiments this was unexpected. Comparison with a supplementary measurement of the same reaction solution which was kept ex-situ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> bottom) indicates that a radiation damage of the enzyme or eumelanin might have occurred during the time-resolved measurement. Secondly, the eumelanin particle formation was observed in MES buffered solution at a pH of 6.2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Under these conditions the formation of the particles was additionally characterised after completion of the growth reaction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) as has been done in the case of ambient oxygen content at. The sample-detector distance of 3 m turned out not to be suitable to determine the size of the formed particles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, top). A second experiment at a sample-detector distance of 10 m was followed for 5 h. However, the scattering signal remained on a low level, which again might be caused by radiation damage. A sample of the same reaction solution was kept ex-situ and was measured after 24 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, bottom). This experiment corresponds to the one shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> denoted as pH 6.2 O2 and yields very similar results.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SAXS measurements of eumelanin particles prepared in MES buffer at pH 6.2 and 7.2.
