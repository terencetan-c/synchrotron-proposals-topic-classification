<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Real-time ion distribution mapping in organic memristor by X-ray fluorescence Functioning of the organic memristor is based on the conductivity variation due to the redox reactions in polyaniline. These reactions involve ion motion between the active layer and solid electrolyte.</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to make real-time mapping of the distribution of ions along the working area of the memristor during its functioning. Special attention was paied to the study of the periodic variation of the ionic profile in the mode of current oscillation generation.</p><p>Scheme of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1 Active layer of polyaniline (green layer) was deposited onto thin Kapton film (yellow layer). The film was placed on the sample-holder, providing metal contact to the polyaniline layer. Electrolyte, based on the gel of polyethylene oxide with Rb salt, was added to the well in the central part of the sample-holder. Polyanilyne was placed in the contact with the electrolyte. Reference electrode was placed into the electrolyte gel. X-ray fluorescence was excited by the grazing-angle incident X-ray. Fluorescence was analyzed by the detector, placing an aperture between it and the sample. Displacement of the sample during measurements allowed to determine the distribution of the Rb ions along the active zone (contact of polyaniline with electrolyte). The experiment was started with the calibration of the detector. Two lines, corresponding to the Rb fluorescence were identified and their integral intensity was used in the following experiments. Variation of the Rb fluorescence in the active layer in time during the measurements of the cyclic voltage current charactiristics is shown in Fig. 2. measurements of the cyclic voltage current charactiristics</p><p>The measurements were started at 0 V and increased til +1.2 V. Then, the voltage was decreased till -1.2 V and increased again till 0 V. First measurenents were done without operture collecting the fluorescence intensity from the whole sample.</p><p>It was found a direct correlation of the conductivity with the integral intensity of Rb in the active zone.</p><p>Experiments on the profile determination were first carried out by studying the kinetics at fixed bias voltages: +0.8 V and -0.3 V. The first value (scans 64-78) corresponds to the oxidation of the polyaniline and transformation of the memristor into the conducting state.</p><p>The second value (scans 79-91) corresponds to the reduction potential of polyaniline and transformation of the memristor to the insulating state.</p><p>Thickness of the polyaniline in the active layer was varied from 24 to 96 nm.</p><p>Each measurement requiered the determination of the working point (in depth). Thus each sample was scanned in z direction and the position was determined analyzing the intensity of the transmitted exciting X-ray radiation.</p><p>Mapping of the fluorescence intensity was done in the reduced voltage range (-0.6 -+0.8 V and -0.6 -+1.0 V) with increased time delay in order to have more time for the sample displacement at each voltage value.</p><p>Autooscillation measurements were performed by attaching an external capacitor of 4.7 mF in the circuit of the reference electrode. Oscillations were observed not for all measurements (it is a normal behavior in previous measurements of the electrical characteristics). Different samples with different bias voltages were measured. The best oscillations were observed at +7.0 V bias voltage (scans 595-667 and 688-1166).</p><p>Analysis of the data have revealed a serious difficulty in the connection of the X-ray fluorescence data with those of the electrical characterization, due to the fact that these measurements were controlled by different computers, what have resulted in the difficulties in the sinchronization of these independent measurements. However, the material we have obtained during the experiment has demonstrated the possibility of the real-time mapping of ion distribution and the only requirement is a better sinchronization of the electrical and Xray measurements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
