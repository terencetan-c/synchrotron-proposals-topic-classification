<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The aims of these experiments were to i) synthesize novel CaxNy and SrxNy solids at ultrahigh pressures, ii) solve their crystal structure and, iii) determine their equation of state and stability domain. This study was expected to lead to more accurate physico-chemical models of alkaline earth-N interactions and, importantly, provide potentially game-changing first insights into the ultrahigh pressure chemistry of nitrogen and ultrahigh energy N-species. The knowledge obtained during these experiments will be key to inspiring new designs of ambient conditions polynitrogen-based materials and potentially unlocking the next generation high energy density material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>BX90-type diamond anvil cells with culets of 40 to 80 μm were prepared. Calcium azide and strontium azide pieces were loaded along with molecular nitrogen, acting as a reagent as well as a pressure transmitting medium. Pressures were measured based on the equation of state of the Re gasket and verified with the first Raman edge of diamond 1,2 . The samples were precompressed to the targeted pressures of 150 and 200 GPa and laser-heated to temperatures above 2000 K at our laboratory in Bayreuth. Preliminary Raman measurements showed new vibrational modes, suggesting the formation of Ca-and Sr-N compounds. These samples were brought to ID11 for single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of the synthesized phases.</p><p>Upon arrival at the ID11 beamline, it was found that one diamond anvil of the Sr(N3)2+N2 cell at about 200 GPa had been broken during transportation, and that pressure had dropped down to 65 GPa. Measurements on the other Sr(N3)2+N2, at 150 GPa, revealed the formation of the previously observed SrN16 (see experimental report HC-4225), as well as a phase which could not yet be solved due to twinning.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiments on Ca(N3)2+N2, on the other hand, resulted in the synthesis of four Ca-N phases, CaN5, α-CaN6, β-CaN6 and CaN8, with all but α-CaN6 being previously unobserved. Their structures, drawn in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, were fully solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, these four compounds are all comprised of exotic polymeric nitrogen chains. Those found in β-CaN6 and CaN8 are especially striking, adopting an arrangement never seen before, which can simplistically be described as chains of N6 units. These are reminiscent of those found in the hexagonal layered polymeric nitrogen (HLP-N) phase-a phase of pure nitrogen that forms near 250 GPa. The comparison of the polynitrogen chains typically formed below 150 GPa and those at greater pressure underpins a clear trend. Polynitrogen chains below 150 GPa typically feature two-fold coordinated nitrogen atoms with shorter N-N distances. On the other hand, the β-CaN6 and CaN8 solids produced at higher pressures feature significantly more three-fold coordinated nitrogen atoms with longer N-N distances.</p><p>The decompression of these phases was initiated, but could not be completed within the allocated beamtime.</p><p>With the synthesis of four phases, including three new, the beamtime was undoubtedly a great success. Future experiments will again attempt the investigation of the Sr-N system at very high pressures and complete the decompression of the CaN5, α-CaN6, β-CaN6 and CaN8 compounds. This beamtime will result in at least one scientific publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 Figure 1 :</head><label>31</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimentally determined crystal structures and polynitrogen units of the CaN5 (a-b), α-CaN6 (c-d), β-CaN6 (e-f) and CaN8 (g-h) compounds.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,40.80,188.40,518.88,165.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
