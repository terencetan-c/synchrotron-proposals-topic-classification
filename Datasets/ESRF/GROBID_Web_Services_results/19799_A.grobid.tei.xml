Stunault*, ILL -Grenoble Report:</p><p>Samarium and Neodymium are two light rare earths that exhibit complex modulated magnetic phases. They crystallize in a hexagonal lattice, with a four-plane stacking sequence along the c-axis for Nd (dhcp) and a nine-plane one for Sm. Previous detailed investigation devoted to pure samarium has shown that Sm films with a dhcp structure could also be obtained by Molecular Beam Epitaxy, under specific elaboration condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The magnetic phases in this dhcp structure have been determined by resonant X ray magnetic scattering (experiment HE 719) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Taking advantage of this elaboration method, we could also grow Sm/Nd superlattices, where both element exhibit the same dhcp stacking sequence and where this dhcp stacking is coherent over many periods (i.e. bilayer thickness) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The study of the magnetic phases and magnetic coupling phenomena in such superlattices, related to crystal structures and stackings, is a suitable way to test magnetic coupling models. Such investigation in these complex heterostructures, where both components are magnetic, requires a powerful technique as RXMS that combines a high sensitivity and the essential chemical selectivity.</p><p>The main sample investigated during this experiment was a [Sm(37Å)/Nd(187Å)]x50 superlattice whose growth direction is parallel to the (0001) axis. The Resonant X-ray Magnetic Scattering experiments with polarization analysis have been performed on the ID20 beamline, at both the Sm L 3 edge (6.708 keV) and the Nd L 2 edge (E=6.723 keV), using a crystal Cu(220) as analyzer. The scans have been measured along various directions of the reciprocal space (H and L), in order to determine the magnetic propagation vectors and the coherence length along the growth direction. A cryostat for experiments has been used to carry out a careful thermal analysis down to 2K.</p><p>At the samarium L 3 edge, we could measure the magnetic satellites corresponding to the magnetic ordering of the moments located on the cubic sites. As in pure dhcp films, the magnetic propagation vector for cubic sites is (0.25 0 1), it does not evolve with temperature, and the ordering temperature is close to 24K. The scan measured along the L direction exhibits a broad contribution whose full width at half maximum reveals a magnetic coherence length of 23 Å, that is smaller than the samarium individual layer thickness. It was not possible to measure any magnetic contribution from the ordering on the hexagonal sites: The expected positions are superimposed to charge contribution that was still too high, even in the rotated channel.</p><p>At the neodymium L 2 edge, the thermal investigation revealed particularly interesting results that are gathered in figures 1 and 2. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the scans measured along the H-direction at various temperatures, whereas figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents three scans measured along the L-direction across the various magnetic contributions.</p><p>0,10 0,12 0,14 0,16 0,18 0,20 -8 -4 0 4 8 12 16 2K 4.5K 5K 7K 8K 11K 15K 19K Nd edge L II (Q h 0 7) I n t e n s i t y ( * 1 0 -3 c p s / m o n . )</p><p>Q h (rlu)</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: H-scans measured for L=7 in decreasing temperature for the incident photons energy tuned to the Nd L 2 edge</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> reveals that the magnetic phases in Nd between 19K and 5K are close to bulk Nd. The ordering on the hexagonal sites (green contribution between Q l =0.14 and 0.12 r.l.u.) occurs below 19K, whereas the ordering on the cubic sites (blue contribution around Q l =0.18r.l.u.) occurs below 8K. The propagation wave vectors are similar to the bulk ones, although no multi-q structure was observed. Figures <ref type="figure">2a</ref> and <ref type="figure">2c</ref> show a main difference for these two phases: the magnetic order on the hexagonal sites propagates coherently through magnetic samarium with a coherence length of 244 Å, whereas the coherence length of the cubic order is limited to 73 Å (i.e. smaller than Nd individual layers).</p><p>6,90 6,95 7,00 7,05 7,10 3,0 3,2 3,4 3,6 3,8 4,0 6K Nd L II (0.181 0 L) I n t e n s i t y ( * 1 0 -4 c t s / m o n . ) Q l (rlu) 8,90 8,95 9,00 9,05 9,10 2K Nd L II ( 0.159 0.001 L) I n t e n s i t y ( * 1 0 -4 c t s / m o n . ) Q l (rlu) 8,90 8,95 9,00 9,05 9,10 0 5 10 15 8K Nd L II (0.1267 0 L)</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: L-scans measured across the three magnetic contribution observed in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, for the incident photons energy tuned to the Nd L 2 edge A point of high interest has been observed at lower temperature (T&lt;5K), since the magnetic intensity on the previous satellites (corresponding to hexagonal and cubic sites) decreases to give rise to a new magnetic phase for Nd (red contribution around Q l =15.5 r.l.u.). In contrast to what is usually observed in Nd or Nd-based systems, the magnetic moments on hexagonal and cubic sites seem to form an almost homogeneous magnetic phase with very close propagation vectors. Moreover, this phase also propagates coherently through magnetic samarium, as evidenced in figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. The coherence length has been calculated to be around 271 Å.</p><p>In conclusion, RXMS experiments performed in polarization analysis permitted to determine separately the magnetic phases and the magnetic coherence of Sm and Nd elements in a dhcp Sm/Nd superlattice. In both components, the cubic magnetic orders appear to be confined to individual layers. Nevertheless, the hexagonal magnetic orders that, in Nd, is coherent through magnetic samarium, coexists with these non-coherent phases. Moreover, an amazing magnetic structure, also coherent through Sm, has been discovered at low temperature in Nd. A complementary study has now to be undertaken in order to investigate the Sm magnetic behavior in this low temperature range.</p></div>		</body>
