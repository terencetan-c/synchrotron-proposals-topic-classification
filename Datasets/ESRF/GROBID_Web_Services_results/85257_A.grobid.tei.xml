<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Five samples had been prepared and shipped to ESRF for this experimental run. During the entire beam time, the beam intensity showed such strong instabilities that only a few scans for three samples (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) could be analysed. The liquid-nitrogen cooling system for the first Si(111) crystal (0°) of the new double-crystal monochromator, which had just been installed by FMB Oxford, was not functioning properly. During the beam time, technical support from FMB Oxford had to be called.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> Chemical conditions of samples with Pu sorbed on hardened cement paste (HCP, water/cement = 0.5) in different electrolytes. All samples were prepared under Ar atmosphere with a solid-to-liquid ratio (S/L) of 2.5 g/L. The initial concentration was 5 µM 239 Pu(III). After three days for preconditioning, the contact time with Pu was three days. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation with 108,000 g for 1 h. Electrolytes: VGL -German acronym for Verdünnte Gipshutlösung, I = 2.5 M, 2.523 M NaCl, 0.01 M CaCl2´6H2O, 0.008 M Na2SO4, 0.0051 M KCl); VGL-ACW -artificial cement water obtained by leaching of HCP (S/L = 10 g/L) in VGL for seven days. The following conclusions can be drawn from these measurements:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample ID</head><p>• The energy of the Pu L3-edge XANES (not shown) and the average Pu-O distance of 2.24 -2.26 Å are indicative for Pu(IV). This means that the initially added Pu(III) has been oxidized to Pu(IV) during the reaction in the HCP suspension. • The EXAFS analysis did not show any evidence of Pu-Pu interaction, i.e., no polynuclear Pu species or precipitates could be observed. • The detection of Si and Ca coordination shells of Pu allow to conclude that Pu (IV) has been taken up by calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH) phases, the main constituent (50 wt.%) of HCP. • The samples 02 and 04 prepared in VGL-ACW did not show a second Si shell at 3.60 Å as observed for sample 01 prepared in VGL. However, this difference could also be the result of uncertainties and noise in the EXAFS spectra and should be remeasured. • In summary, the three samples show similar structural parameters indicative of Pu(IV) uptake by CSH phases of hardened cement. This agrees with results obtained at lower ionic strength, e.g., the EXAFS study of <ref type="bibr">Gaona et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2011, 45, 8765-8771)</ref> on the uptake of Np(IV) by CSH phases and cement paste. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>*N= 6.971 *R= 2.2603 *σ2= 0.01074 *Eo= -0.902 Pu-Si *N= 2.030 *R= 3.0346 /σ2= 0.01074 *Eo= -9.547 Pu-Ca *N= 3.910 *R= 4.0533 /σ2= 0.01074 /Eo= -9.547</figDesc></figure>

For energy calibration, the Zr K-edge (17998.0 eV) XANES spectrum of a Zr metal foil was measured simultaneously in transmission mode during each scan. The EXAFS data analysis was done with the software packages EXAFSPAK and FEFF9 using a structural model based on 14 Å tobermorite, where Ca in the CaO interlayer was replaced by Pu. The best model to the experimental data and the obtained structural parameters are shown in Figure1and Table2, respectively.Raw k 3 -wheighted Pu L3-edge EXAFS spectra and best fit to the experimental data (left panel) together with the corresponding Fourier transform magnitudes (right panel).

The energy shift, DE0, and the Debye-Waller factor, s 2 , of the O, Si, and Ca shells were fixed to the same value, respectively, and varied as global parameters. S0 2 was fixed to 0.9. Typical uncertainties are ±0.5 atoms for N, ±0.02 Å for R and ±0.001 Å 2 for s 2 , respectively.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Electrolyte</cell><cell>Final pH</cell><cell>Eh (SHE) mV</cell><cell>Pu loading ppm</cell></row><row><cell>Pu17-01</cell><cell>VGL</cell><cell>10.2</cell><cell>+20</cell><cell>553</cell></row><row><cell>Pu17-02</cell><cell>VGL-ACW</cell><cell>10.2</cell><cell>+100</cell><cell>632</cell></row><row><cell>Pu17-04</cell><cell>VGL-ACW</cell><cell>12.9</cell><cell>-140</cell><cell>169</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">Multiple scans of Pu L3-edge (18057.0 eV) XAFS spectra were collected at 15 K in fluorescence mode using</cell></row><row><cell>the 13-element</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
