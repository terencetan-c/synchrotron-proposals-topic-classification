<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Uranium speciation in natural carbonates -implications for Earth's oxygenation history The chemical behavior of redox sensitive metals in nature is strongly tied to the oxidation state of the metal and its ligands. Yet, direct observations of rare metals are challenged by the low abundance in the environment. In this experiment, we demonstrated the use of High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) to study uranium in geological samples at the U L3 and M4 edges (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Well-constrained XANES spectra were derived for environmental samples (sediments) with ≥1.6 ppm U and ≥ 80 ppm U at the two edges, respectively.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. In ES-970, U L3 and U M4 HERFD-XANES spectra were collected for the following samples:</p><p>* Planned experiments according to the original proposal. We were also able to analyse samples at the U L3 edge, and even record good XANES spectra at the M4 edge for U-rich samples with ≥ 80 ppm U. Below detection level: &lt;DL.</p></div>

Still, there is no pure synthetic reference material that adequately fit the the hexavalent U phase(s) present in the samples.</p></div>

Comparison of the estimated average U oxidation state in marine carbonate sediment samples based on data from our newly calibrated anaerobic U(IV)-U(VI) extraction method and linear combination fitting of the HERFD-XANES results. The linear combination assumes samples are best described as binary mixtures of an oxidized sediment sample (MJ1 with 92% U(VI) and 8% U(IV); yellow circle) and tetravalent uraninite (UO2).</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of main results</head><p>1) Expected hexavalent U and discovered mixed oxidation states Thermodynamic considerations predict that uranium resides as tetravalent species in marine sediments. We found that both hexavalent and tetravalent U species are present in carbonate samples. We are currently writing a manuscript on this topic <ref type="bibr">(Olesen et al., in prep)</ref>.</p><p>The HERFD-XANES data consolidates that U resides as hexavalent U in most of the studied sediment samples -even in samples that have been deposited under strictly anoxic and sulfidic conditions (discussed further below). There was no sign of oxidation at the beamline, and follow-up experiments in our laboratory using various protocols for our newly established anaerobic extraction technique shows that U resides in a form that is either air-sensitive and/or sensitive to oxidizing fluids; i.e. U sensitive to ferric iron present in the pore fluid before extraction. This problem only seem to occur for modern/wet sediments and not for ancient/geological rock powders. We have found a procedure to minimize oxidation of wet sediment samples. Still, future work should aim to analyse samples anoxically and/or at ultra-low temperature and to characterize the unknown tetravalent U phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Confirmed hexavalent U with multiple methods in even the most extreme anoxic environment</head><p>We also found a near perfect match between the U oxidation state estimates obtained by HERFD-XANES analyses the U L3 and U M4 edge. This measurement was only possible for the U-rich organic-rich mudrock samples. It came as a real surprise that all of the uranium resides in hexavalent U species, so we have come up with various explanations for this. In combination with oxidation-sensitivity experiments, we consider U as hosted in the form of nanocrystalline UO2 in these samples -perhaps in association with organic/biological material. Given that U reduction occurs via microbial reduction in both marine carbonates underlying oxic bottom waters and in marine organic-rich mudrocks underlying anoxic waters, we consider it likely that both types of sediments host the same form of tetravalent U phases. Yet, this still needs experimental verification.</p><p>The discovery of U(VI) in these samples has important environmental implications because oxidized/hexavalent U is thought to be easily mobilized in nature. Hence, oxidative fluids percolating the Alum shale and other organic-rich mudrocks t should be is of real concern in terms of ground water pollution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Tais W.
