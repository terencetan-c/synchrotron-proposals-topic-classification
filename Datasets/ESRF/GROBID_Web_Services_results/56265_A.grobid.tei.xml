<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to study possible high-spin to low-spin transition of MnGe expected upon lattice shrinkage, single-crystal of MnGe, Mn 0.8 Fe 0.2 Ge, Mn 0.6 Fe 0.4 Ge were selected and prepared for high-pressure x-ray diffraction experiment. We used diamond anvil cells filled with Ne as a pressure-transmitting medium. It enabled us to reach the pressure of ~50 GPa. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction images were further analyzed using the computer program CrysAlisPro in order to determine the lattice parameters. The obtained equations of state (EOS) were fitted by EosFit7 in terms of Birch-Murnaghan model <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1)</ref>. None of sharp features in the EOS were observed, still one of the parameters of the model for MnGe, i.e. B0' is appeared to be unexpectedly high (8.0 ± 0.3). Whereas, the substitution of Mn with Fe leads to collapsing this anomaly, in particular for the compound with 20% of Fe concentration B0' = 6.5 ± 0.1. The observed anomaly of MnGe requires further investigations, the preliminary results are in agreement with recently proposed hypothesis of magnetoelastic state that accompanies the spin crossover <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. A complete analysis of the data collected is in progress. [1] M. <ref type="bibr">Deutsch, et. al., Phys. Rev.
