<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Photo-induced structural dynamics in molecular materials often involve two main components; local molecular distortions induced by the self-trapping of electronic excited state and incoherent lattice dynamics due to energy dissipation. The latter component frequently hinders clear manifestation at macroscopic scale of local self-trapped entities and their coupling to the lattice. The studied material RbMnFe is a Prussian Blue Analogue that exhibits no thermal expansion, which allows for the observation of long-range dynamics induced by the structural trapping of photoinduced charge-transfer states. Indeed the photoinduced Mn III Fe II to Mn II Fe III charge-transfer states correspond to small-polarons, involving local Jahn-Teller distortion and volume expansion, responsible for the emergence of various physical properties. At equilibrium, the lattice expansion and the ferroelastic Jahn-Teller distortion evolve in a coupled way. Here, we use time resolved X-ray diffraction to investigate the anisotropic out-of-equilibrium lattice dynamics triggered by the self-trapping of CT state induced by ultrafast optical excitation. The observed dynamics evidence a decoupling of both types of lattice deformation in the time domain, with an impulsive lattice response due to Jahn-Teller reorganization and displacive volume expansion controlled by the long-lived fraction of self-trapped photo-induced CT state.</p></div>

Therefore, materials presenting structural distortion without thermal expansion are ideal playground to investigate interactions of quasiparticles such as self-trapped small-polarons with the lattice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> which may trigger long-range lattice deformations in materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Cyano-bridged bimetallic systems are of specific interest, since they exhibit various types of orders tunable by light, like reversible ferro-or antiferro-magnetism. Those functions are based on photo-induced intermetallic charge transfer (CT) or spin-transition (ST) coupled to structural self-trapping and symmetry changes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Prussian blue analogues (PBA) in particular are characterized by CT based transformation that are strongly cooperative due to the important volume change accompanying both thermal and steady photo-induced phase transition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and which implies strong interactions of the CT process with the lattice. It is therefore compulsory to understand the coupling between self-trapped CT excitation, known as small-polarons, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and the lattice and its impact in the emergence of macroscopic order and functionalities.</p><p>Here we study the photo-induced out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the RbMnFe PBA system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> which undergoes a CT-based phase transition resulting from the coupling between intermetallic CT, responsible for an important non-symmetry-breaking volume (V) strain, and a symmetry-breaking Jahn-Teller distortion associated with ferroelastic shear strain 𝜂. In the framework of the Landau theory of phase transitions, we have shown that due to their elastic coupling, V and 𝜂 change simultaneously at thermal equilibrium during the CT-based phase transition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Here we investigate the lattice dynamics resulting from the photoinduced Fe-to-Mn CT process by time-resolved X-ray diffraction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> which allows for monitoring in real time the long-range lattice reorganization. The observed dynamics reveal the decoupling in the time domain of the non-symmetrybreaking (nsb) volume strain and symmetry-breaking (sb) ferroelastic strain. We show that the fraction of lessbonding self-trapped CT excited state, controlled by light excitation, acts as an external parameter for lattice expansion, allowing for reaching a transient state hidden at thermal equilibrium. We studied the RbMnFe system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), with composition Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.98•2.5H2O, which exhibits bistability between two phases with different structural and electronic configurations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The high temperature (HT) phase forms a FCC lattice with metals in Oh ligand fields of electronic configuration Mn II (S=5/2)Fe III (S=½). The low temperature (LT) phase is tetragonal, as a Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes the Mn III (S=2)Fe II (S=0) electronic configuration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Various techniques described the occurrence of the CTbased phase transition from Mn III Fe II (LT) to Mn II Fe III (HT) at thermal equilibrium, or under continuous light irradiation at low temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> The degree of CT is monitored through the evolution of the totally symmetric order parameter 𝛾 measuring the fraction of Mn II Fe III CT state that changes from 𝛾=0 in the LT phase to 𝛾=1 in the HT phase. 𝛾is usually probed by magnetism or optical spectroscopies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> The thermal phase transition exhibits a wide hysteresis 37 (Tup≈285K, Tdown≈185 K) as revealed by magnetic susceptibility (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows the important changes in the lattice parameters on warming from the LT tetragonal space group 𝐹4 ̅ 2𝑚 (aLT=10.059(3) Å, cLT=10.502(3) Å) to the HT cubic space group (𝐹4 ̅ 3𝑚, aHT=10.563(1) Å). Our X-ray diffraction data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) highlight the symmetry change during the CT-based phase transition, with a zoom in the ranges of scattering vector q [1.13-1.31 Å -1 ] and [2.29-2.61 Å <ref type="bibr">-1</ref> ]. The (h00) and (00l) peaks are equivalent in the cubic HT phase and correspond to the same q. In the LT tetragonal phase the (h00) and (00l) peaks split and correspond to different q, due to the stronger contraction along a compared to c. As explained recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> this structural instability occurs at the  point of the Brillouin Zone and the transition can be described at equilibrium in terms of two coupled order parameters. The ferroelastic cubic-tetragonal distortion is the symmetry-breaking (sb) order parameter, which belongs to the E representation of the HT 4 ̅ 3𝑚 point group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> shows its amplitude defined as (𝑇) =</p><p>2 √3 ( 𝑐(𝑇)-𝑎(𝑇) 𝑎 𝐻𝑇</p><p>).</p><p>This anisotropic distortion obeys transformation properties (2z 2 -x 2 -y 2 ) of the Jahn-Teller mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> elongating c and contracting the other axes a = b and results in a splitting of the lattice parameters in the LT phase:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝜟𝒂 𝒔𝒃 = 1 2</formula><p>(2𝒂 𝑳𝑻 -𝒂 𝑳𝑻 -𝒃 𝑳𝑻 ) = 𝒄 𝑳𝑻 -𝒂 𝑳𝑻 = 0.443(1) Å.</p><p>The non-symmetry-breaking (nsb) volume strain is related to the average change of the lattice parameter:</p><p>𝜟𝒂 𝒏𝒔𝒃 = 𝒂 𝑯𝑻 -&lt; 𝒂 𝑳𝑻 &gt;= 0.353(1) Å, with &lt; 𝒂 𝑳𝑻 &gt;= Indeed, during the LT to HT phase transition, the population of the anti-bonding Mn dx 2 -y 2 state in the Mn II Fe III HT phase favors Oh symmetry around the manganese, reorganizing so the energy levels of the orbitals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> The LT Mn-N bonds along x and y (≈1.89 Å) expand and the ones along z (≈2.29 Å) shorten (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) to get equivalent (≈2.05 Å) in the cubic HT phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> Due to the polymeric nature of the lattice, and the additional elongation of the Fe-C bonds, the CT transition from the Mn III Fe II LT towards the less-bonding Mn II Fe III HT phases results in a global volume expansion from VLT=1062.2(2) Å 3 to VHT=1178.5(2) Å 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). This large volume change is responsible for the phase nucleation process, where the HT and LT phases coexist, which translates into a weight transfer between HT to LT Bragg peaks during the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>). In the frame of the Landau theory of phase transition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> we have shown that the volume change at the transition is linearly coupled to the totally symmetric order parameter 𝛾, which is the main contribution to volume expansion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Since this system exhibits zero thermal expansion in LT or HT phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and the volume changes from 𝑉 𝐿𝑇 in the LT phase (𝛾=0) to 𝑉 𝐻𝑇 in the HT phase (𝛾=1), the thermal evolution of the fraction of Mn II Fe III CT state 𝛾(𝑇) can then be derived from the relative lattice expansion with respect to the LT phase:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝛾(𝑇) = 𝑉(𝑇)-𝑉 𝐿𝑇 𝑉 𝐻𝑇 -𝑉 𝐿𝑇</formula><p>shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> (right axis). Our recent study explained that, at thermal equilibrium, the simultaneous and discontinuous change of the parameters monitoring the CT (𝛾 and V) and the ferroelastic symmetry breaking (), is due to their elastic coupling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> In addition to thermal equilibrium phase transition, the CT between the ground Mn III Fe II and Mn II Fe III configurations can also be photo-induced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Nevertheless, the dynamics resulting from the interaction of the local structural self-trapping process of this photoinduced CT with the surrounding lattice is currently unknown, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> as the techniques used so far were lacking time resolution. Hereafter, we use ultrafast timeresolved x-ray diffraction to study the lattice response to a laser pulse, driving the photoinduced CT. The ultrafast photo-induced lattice dynamics is monitored with optical pump 一 X-ray probe configuration at the ERSF ID09 beamline <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> with ~70 ps experimental time resolution (supplementary information). The sample is cool down at 110, 130 and 160 K in the LT phase Mn III Fe II and excited with 1 ps laser pulses centered at 520 nm.</p><p>This optical excitation is known for promoting the intervalence electron transfer from Fe to Mn to create the Mn II Fe III configuration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> The ≈300 nm typical size of the nanocrystals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> similar to the pump penetration depth (≈350 nm), <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ensures a rather homogeneous excitation at the individual nanocrystal scale.</p><p>The photo-induced CT process occurs on the picosecond time scale and the resulting transient electronic state lasts for more than 10 µs, as revealed by different techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref>  The relative diffracted intensity difference between 75 ps and negative delay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>) shows this anisotropic lattice response. It is characterized by a shift of the (00l) Bragg peaks towards higher scattering vector q, corresponding to the contraction of the c axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>), and the opposite shift of the (h00) peaks towards lower q, corresponding to the expansion of the a axis (a=b Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>). This is strikingly different from the simultaneous expansion of a and c observed during the thermal equilibrium transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>), where (h00) and (00l) low temperature peaks become equivalent in the cubic HT phase. However, 75 ps after photoexcitation the increase of V and decrease of 𝜂 moves the system towards the values of the HT phase. In a second step, the partial decrease of a is accompanied by an increase of c, which recovers values almost similar to the ones prior to optical excitation. Compared to negative delay, the relative diffracted intensity changes at 600 ps shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S8</ref>, corresponds mainly to a shift towards lower q of the (h00) peaks, i.e. an expansion along the a axis. This different evolution of a and c increases the ferroelastic distortion 𝜂, which recovers values close to initial equilibrium conditions. However, the lattice volume V remains constant after photoexcitation and larger than at equilibrium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref> &amp; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref>). For describing the ultrafast volume expansion, occurring within the time resolution, we used a step function convoluted with the instrumental response function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>, 3e and S6). An additional exponential relaxation (𝜏 𝑟 =130 ps) provides a satisfactory guide for the eye to describe the decay in (Figs 3a, 3b, 3d, 3f and S6). The initial expansion of a and contraction of c are also quite linear with excitation densities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S7</ref>). In addition, the photo-responses, at 110 and 160 K are similar to the ones at 130 K for similar excitation densities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3e-f</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We should underline that, since this system exhibits no thermal expansion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> the observed volume expansion is not due to laser heating, through the incoherent lattice phonon population. The photo-responses are also similar in shapes or amplitudes, for different excitation densities and over a wide temperature range (110-160 K), well below the phase transition temperature (300 K), which confirms the non-thermal origin of the response.</p><p>The absence of excitation densities dependence in the lattice response timescale, the linear response to excitation density (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S7</ref>) and the anisotropic structural dynamics suggest that the origin of this macroscopic long-range lattice dynamics is the local self-trapping of the photoinduced CT. Indeed, previous experiments have shown that photoexcitation of the Mn III Fe II state drives the intervalence electron transfer to create the Mn II Fe III configuration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> The associated population of Mn dx 2 -y 2 state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) is stabilized by elongating the Mn-N bonds along x and y, which reduces the Jahn-Teller distortion and brings the Mn sites towards Oh symmetry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy evidenced that this local lattice deformation, dissolving the Jahn-Teller distortion, occurs within ≈1 ps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> In a similar CoFe analogue, femtosecond XANES experiments monitored the Co-N bond elongation, trapping the photoinduced CT, within 50 fs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> This anisotropic structural self-trapping of the Mn II Fe III CT state results in a local lattice distortion, characteristic of these small-polarons, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> elastically coupled to the lattice. These local and reverse Jahn-Teller distortions around the MnN6 octahedron, within the cyano-bridged polymeric lattice, generate anisotropic strains, sources of elastic deformation waves travelling through the crystals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> The structural trappings of the CT states within the crystal, elongating Mn-N bonds along x and y and contracting those along z, result then in a global expansion of a and b axes and a contraction of the c axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>). Such elastic deformations propagate typically with sound velocity (c = 4300 m/s) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> and the characteristic timescale 𝜏 𝐸𝐷 for volume expansion scales to the average crystal size <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> (𝑟 ≈ 3.10 -7 m). 𝜏 𝐸𝐷 = 𝑟 𝑐 ≈ 70 𝑝𝑠 falls within our time resolution. The anisotropic structural reorganization around the self-trapped CT state, dissolving the Jahn-Teller distortion, is responsible for the initial decrease of the ferroelastic distortion 𝜂, while its less bonding nature accounts for the global volume increase.</p><p>After this initial structural dynamics, the volume strain and the ferroelastic distortion decouple in time. The photo-induced CT Mn II Fe III state is long-lived due to the structural trapping, as previously observed by optical and X-ray spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S9</ref> shows that volume relaxation occurs within 10s µs, which corresponds to the lifetime of the self-trapped CT state as monitored by optical density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> Given that the fraction 𝛾 ℎ𝜈 of photoinduced CT states couples linearly to the volume strain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> that these live much longer than the elastic equilibration timescale of the lattice and that there is no thermal lattice expansion in this system, the lattice expansion directly correlates to 𝛾 ℎ𝜈 and both are transiently locked up after photoexcitation. The observed 0.1% volume change after photoexcitation, compared to the 10% volume change when CT is complete during the thermal transition, provides a rough estimate of 𝛾 ℎ𝜈 =1% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S7</ref>), which confirms the local nature of the process. In order to restore elastic equilibrium, the internal stress due to long-range structural deformations related to the formation of CT small-polarons must be minimized. The ferroelastic deformation 𝜂, initially reduced by local distortions, has to equilibrate with the globally tetragonal lattice surrounding the smallpolarons, and it almost recovers the equilibrium value within ≈500 ps. On contrary, the long lifetime of the selftrapped CT state, of higher molecular volume, prevents lattice contraction and locks transiently the crystalline volume over 10s µs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S9</ref>). The volume strain and the ferroelastic distortion decouple then in time because different processes drive their dynamics. The volume expansion corresponds to a displacive process, driven by the long-lived fraction 𝛾 ℎ𝜈 of photoinduced Mn II Fe III sites of higher volume. The evolution of 𝜂 is mainly impulsive as characterized by its initial overshoot, in response to local and anisotropic distortions. Indeed, due to anisotropy the effect of the local and reverse Jahn-Teller reorganizations superpose and drive anisotropic lattice response. This decoupling in the time domain of the ferroelastic deformation and volume strain differs from thermal equilibrium transformation, where V and  change in a coupled way. The transient photoinduced lattice parameters after 500 ps corresponds then to a transient state, not observed at thermal equilibrium.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref> shows a schematic evolution of the potential at equilibrium, with a single equilibrium volume VLT or VHT, except in the hysteresis region where both coexist. The zero thermal expansion in the investigated temperature range <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> implies a quasi-harmonic potential around VLT and VHT. The evolution of the partial DOS on the Mn after photoexcitation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c</ref>) qualitatively explains the observed dynamics, as the lattice potential is modified by the fraction of CT state 𝛾 ℎ𝜈 . This partial population of antibonding Mn dx 2 -y 2 states launches the reverse Jahn-teller distortion and results in a self-trapping of the CT state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). The Mn-N bonds elongate then along x and y, which expands the a and b lattice axes, shifting so the transient equilibrium volume of the photoexcited state compared to the ground state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>). Since the photo-excited state leaves 10s µs, the lattice has to accommodate to the photoinduced population of antibonding electronic states. 𝛾 ℎ𝜈 plays therefore the role of an external parameter controlled by light and acting on the lattice volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Thanks to the ideal playground offered by the RbMnFe material, it is possible to investigate the interaction of structurally self-trapped CT excited states with the lattice, without parasitic contribution from incoherent phonon population. The observed dynamics is rationalized in terms of anisotropic lattice deformations related to symmetry breaking ferroelastic distortion (𝜂) and non-symmetry-breaking volume expansion (V), which are driven by the self-trapping of photoinduced CT states. Contrary to the case of delocalized electronic excitation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> which rapidly thermalize with the lattice, the out-of-equilibrium electronic distribution of excited CT state is not relaxing to the electronic ground state. Indeed, the local and anisotropic structural reorganization of the Mn-N bonds, elongating by ≈10 %, results in the formation of small-polarons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> This prevents fast decay towards the ground state of the less bonding electronic excited state. The lattice deformations driven by those local selftrapped CT states superpose in a constructive way due to anisotropy, which launches a long-range lattice dynamics. The initial impulsive response driven by the anisotropic strain induced by the local self-trapping corresponds to a displacive process, shifting the macroscopic crystal volume. Within ~500 ps after photoexcitation, the ferroelastic distortion relaxes to minimize the global elastic cost, while the long-lived CT small-polarons prevents fast volume relaxation. The high sensitivity of the technique and the large and anisotropic local distortions allow for analyzing how local precursor phenomenon couple to the lattice. The present study highlights that describing the self-trapping dynamics at the scale of the photoactive site only is not sufficient in solid state. Indeed, the elastic energy of the lattice has to be considered in the out-ofequilibrium process, as it is the case at thermal equilibrium in volume-changing molecular magnetic materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Our results highlight the strong interactions of self-trapped photoinduced state with the lattice, which is often neglected, that may play a key role in the inhibition or amplification of photo-induced transformations in volume-changing molecular systems.

We collected the X-ray diffracted intensity with Rayonix MX170-HS CCD detector, with an active area of 170x170mm 2 and a pixel size of 89 µm. We chose a distance of ~23 cm from the sample as a trade-off between q-resolution and portion of q-space explored. A schematic representation of the setup geometry and a typical diffraction image are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref>. In order to increase the statistics, each image was collected using the integration of numerous X-ray shots. The diffraction data were refined using the software TOPAS-Academic version 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> For monitoring the thermally-induced phase transition, we collected x-ray diffraction during a continuous thermal ramp, averaging the data collected within 10 K intervals. The almost zero thermal expansion showed by the MnFe system, revealed by high resolution diffraction studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> could not be accurately monitored by our experimental set-up, due to the relatively poor q-resolution. The refinement process had to take into account the presence of crystals of a known and passive Rb2Mn[Fe(CN)6]•3.5H2O impurity. The temperature dependance of the lattice parameters of the Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.98•2.5H2O sample shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> exhibits a phase transition around 280 K on warming, in good agreement with the magnetic susceptibility (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>In order to study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics, we used a regenerative amplifier coupled to an OPA in order to generate ~1 ps pulses centered around 520 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref>). This wavelength is shown to efficiently promote the intervalence charge transfer from Mn III Fe II to Mn II Fe III using both continuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and pulsed <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> irradiation. The penetration depth in RbMnFe can be calculated starting from the values of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant reported in ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and the penetration depth at 520 nm is around 320 nm, which is similar to the 300 nm average size of the microcrystals composing the sample. This ensures a rather homogeneous excitation at the individual microcrystal scale. We used a quasi-grazing incidence geometry with the sample surface tilted around 4° with respect to the X-ray direction and a laser incidence perpendicular to the direction of the film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref>). This allows for increasing the diffracted signal from the thin film of microcrystals by maximizing the excited area of the sample. This geometry is used to compensate the relatively low X-ray flux, due to the chopper system for time-resolved measurements in use at ID09 for time resolved measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> The optical pump  X-ray probe experiment was performed with ~70 ps time resolution (𝜎 ≃ 30 𝑝𝑠), at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. The time resolution of the experiment was limited by the X-ray pulse duration. The time delay between the pump and the probe was controlled electronically. Each diffraction pattern was collected by integrating the diffracted intensity of up to 3000 X-ray shots at a given time delay. The negative delay signal (-10 ns) was used as reference and was collected several times during each scan to check the complete relaxation of the sample. We used excitation fluences up to 42 μJ.mm -2 . Higher fluences may have resulted in photo-induced residual effects indicating an incomplete relaxation of the sample that would make the data interpretation inconclusive. We collected data at several temperatures (110 K, 130 K and 160 K) outside the bistability region to allow for complete relaxation of the sample.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S4</ref> shows an example of a time-resolved (top) X-ray diffraction pattern I(q) collected 10 ns before laser excitation (negative delays). The bottom pannel shows the differences between the intensity measured at postive delays and the reference signal at negative delay. The diffraction patterns were obtained by azimuthal integration of the diffracted intensity images using the python library PyFAI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Due to the limitation given by the experimental geometry, the presence of the impurity in the sample and the small intensity of the photoinduced signal, it was not possible to perform a Rietveld refinement on the data. We used a Pawley refinement to retrieve the value of the lattice parameters as function of the time delay, using the software TOPAS-Academic version 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> The data at negative delays were refined using the tetragonal LT phase and the cubic impurity. The experimental parameters were refined using these data and were kept fixed during the rest of the analysis. The data presented in Figure 3 were obtained by allowing volume expansion of the passive Rb2Mn[Fe(CN)6]•3.5H2O impurity. These cubic crystals exhibits a weak thermal expansion but does not undergo volume-changing charge-transfer transition. For checking the contribution of this impurity in the conclusion of our work on the lattice dynamics of photoexcited Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.98•2.5H2O crystals, we compare in Fig. S5 the results of the Pawley analysis taking into account the lattice expansion of the impurity (aimp) or not. In both cases we observe for the photoactive Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.98•2.5H2O crystals the same qualitative response with an initial opposite shift of the lattice parameters a and c (clearly seen in the differential data by the opposite shift of the (h00) and (00l) peaks of the Rb0.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.98•2.5H2O sample shown in Fig. 2). These shifts decrease the symmetry breaking order parameter  and result in a global volume expansion. Both analysis shown in Fig. S5 underline the out-of-equilibrium decoupling in time of the volume strain and the ferroelastic distortion. The fits of the time dependent volume 𝑉(𝑡) 𝑉 𝐿𝑇 in Fig. 3 and S5 were performed using a convolution of a Gaussian Instrumental Response Function (IRF) with a step function 𝐻(𝑡): 𝑉(𝑡) 𝑉 𝐿𝑇 = 𝐼𝑅𝐹(𝑡)[𝐴. 𝐻(𝑡)]. A is the amplitude of the step and the 𝐼𝑅𝐹(𝑡) = 1 √2𝜋𝜎 exp (-𝑡 2 2𝜎 2 ) is characterized by 𝜎 ≃ 30 𝑝𝑠 corresponding to an overall time resolution of ~70 ps. For the fits of the time-dependent signals 𝑠(𝑡) of the others lattice parameters, we add an exponential component; 𝑠(𝑡) = 𝐼𝑅𝐹 𝑋 (𝑡) [(𝐴 -𝐵 exp ( -𝑡 𝜏 𝑟 )) * 𝐻(𝑡)]. 𝜏 𝑟 ≃130 ps provides a satisfactory guide for the eye. Fig. S6 shows the effect of the limited time resolution on the signal. Fig. S7 shows the almost linear response with excitation density of the photoinduced lattice changes ∆𝒂 ℎ𝜐 , ∆𝒄 ℎ𝜐 and ∆𝑽 ℎ𝜐 fitted at 75 ps.
