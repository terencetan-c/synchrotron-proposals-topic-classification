<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Date of report:</head><p>18-08-00 Two data sets were collected. Because crystals diffracted very poorly on a rotating anode generator at home, cryo conditions were difficult to establish in the home laborartory. Therefore, the first data set was collected from a crystal at room temperature from 35.0 to 5.0 Å resolution. The overall statistics are R-merge = 7.1%, completeness = 93.9 %, I/σ (I) = 4.5, redundancy = 3.9. Highest resolution shell statistics (5.22 to 5.00 Å) are R-merge = 52.6 %, completeness = 95.4 %, I/sigma(I) = 1.1, redundancy = 3.9. A second data set was collected from 35 to 3.6 Å resolution, from a frozen crystal after finding suitable cryoprotecting conditions. Overall statistics: R-merge = 7.3 %, completeness = 98.5 %, I/σ(I) = 8.4, redundancy = 6.9. Highest resolution shell statistics (3.76 to 3.60 Å): R-merge = 26.9 %, completeness = 96.1 %, I/σ (I) = 2.7, redundancy = 7.2. The room temperature crystal was found to belong to space group P2 1 2 1 2 or P2 1 2 1 2 1 (no 00l reflections were recorded) with unit cell parameters a= 98.86, b= 96.78, c=364.89 Å, while the frozen crystal was found to belong to the tetragonal crystal system, space group P4 1 2 1 2 or P4 3 2 1 2 with unit cell parameters a= 93.98, c=349.108 Å. It is not known whether these crystals truly belong to different crystal forms or a phase transition to a higher symmetry space group was induced by the flash cooling process. The very long c axis limited the resolution of the data that could be recorded on ID14-1. A search for other crystal forms is in progress, and a further data collection on these crystals will be tried on ID14-2 or ID14-4 whenever beam time on these lines becomes available. These data will be also used to solve the structure of this protein, using as model the three-dimensional structure of a similar protein from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calcium binding protein from Desulfovibrio gigas:</head><p>This protein was isolated from the natural microorganism, and has a M.W. of about 45 kDa. Its N-terminal shows significant homology with the calcium binding 'finger' found in calmodulins. Several data sets were collected on different crystals of this protein, as detailed below:</p><p>Crystal Space group Cell (Å) Resolution % R-merge % complete I/σ(I) Redundanc y Native 1 ID14-2 P6 1 or P6 5 a=50.25 c=247.73 1.45 Å (1.54-1.42) 5.4 (32.0) 96.4 (95.0) 14.2 (4.4) 4.5 (2.8) Native 2 P6 1 or P6 5 a=50.36 c=247.89 2.05 Å (2.10-2.05) 5.9 (27.0) 99.6 (98.0) 25.1 (3.5) 4.1 (2.4) Samarium derivative 1 P6 1 or P6 5 a=50.04 c=247.77 2.70 Å (2.80-2.70) 8.7 (27.0) 96.8 (83.0) 11.7 (2.1) 3.2 (2.1) Samarium derivative 2 P6 1 or P6 5 a=49.81 c=247.53 2.90 Å (3.00-2.90) 6.5 (16.7) 94.4 (94.4) 14.8 (8.0) 4.0 3.2 Europium derivative 1 P6 1 or P6 5 a=49.45 c=247.44 3.60 Å (3.73-3.60) 4.2 (5.5) 89.1 (83.5) 16.4 (10.1) 2.8 1.5</p><p>The long unit cell axis (nearly 250 Å) combined with the increase in crystal mosaicity upon flash cooling limited the maximum resolution of the data that could be collected on ID14-1. Data set Native 1 was measured on ID14-2 taking advantage of two spare shifts that were made available to us during this experiment. Of the 'derivative' data sets, Samarium 1 was obtained as a co-crystal and the initial results from a difference Patterson were encouraging. However, we haven't yet managed to interpret it. The other 'derivatives' were soaks prepared at the ESRF and the difference Patterson maps were nearly featureless, indicating very little or no heavy atom incorporation into the crystals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>'Hybrid Cluster protein' from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (native):</head><p>Crystals of this protein were obtained and flash frozen under anaerobic conditions from an anaerobically purified sample. A data set was collected to 1.6 Å resolution on ID14-2, taking advantage of two spare shifts that were made available to us during this experiment. The crystal was found to be a random twin but by closing the slits to 50 µm and by finding a starting crystal orientation where one of the twin components was predominant, its diffraction pattern could be indexed and the data processed satisfactorily. The need to minimise the risk of spatial overlap between spots coming from the different twin components limited the maximum resolution of the data set to 1.6 Å. Also, some decay was apparent towards the end of the data collection. Crystal system is triclinic, space group P1 with cell parameters a=57.40 b=61.66 c=72.14 Å α=82.8 β=73.7 γ=87.4°. Overall statistics: R-merge = 6.8 %, completeness = 96.9 %, I/σ(I) = 7.4, redundancy = 2.3. Highest resolution shell statistics (1.67 to 1.60 Å): R-merge = 10.7 %, completeness = 95.8 %, I/σ(I) = 6.1, redundancy = 2.3. The structure was solved by the 'molecular replacement' method and is being refined with 'CNS'. Current R-factor is 20.1 % and R-free is 20.7 %.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 (native):A data set was collected to 2.60 Å resolution.
