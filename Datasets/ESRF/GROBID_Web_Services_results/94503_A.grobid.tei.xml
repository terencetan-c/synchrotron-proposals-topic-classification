<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In situ investigation of the microstructures of "rubrenelike" β-MT-thienoacenes during thin-film growth 1. Abstract Due to the COVID-19, this beamtime was done by remote access. We prepared thin-film samples in our lab, and sent them to ESRF. The support by the local contacts was excellent. Through the data we analysed the in-plane and out-of-plane structure of our thin films, to correlate the solid-state structures and the optoelectronic properties of our materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Results</head><p>We grew thin films based on various organic small molecules, i.e. anthradithiophene (ADT), ADT derivatives. The growth condition was varied by using different growth time, using templating layer before thin-film growth and using additives during growth. We determined the molecular orientation from XRR data (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). The coherent island size, corresponding to the height of the highest islands were calculated from the full width at half maximum of the Bragg reflections. We analyzed the in-plane microstructure of the thin films from GIXD data (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c-d</ref>), and we clearly observed the improvement of thin-film crystalinity by utilizing a molecular monolayer as templating layer. The coherent island size, corresponding to the lateral domain size of the crystalline islands, were calculated from the GIXD line scan measurement (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). For reciprocal space maps we utilized a 300k PILATUS detector, and the quality of the data is good enough to determine the unit cell of all the thin films.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1a</head><p>Postgrowth XRR scan for a small-molecule organic thin film, 1b GIXD line scan of a smallmolecule organic thin film with templating layer, GIXD scans of the small-molecule organic thin films without (1c) and with (1d) templating layer, the reciprocal space maps clearly indicate the improvement of crystalinity of the thin films.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Remarks on quality of measurements</head><p>We found the ID10 beamline was very suitable for our weakly scattering organic materials. We used a PILATUS 300K to obtain excellent results in the framework of our study. In particular we would like to mention the excellent beam stability during the whole beamtime. Even though due to the COVID-19 we were not able to carry out the experiments by ourselves, with the help of local contacts, through the remote experiments we had obtained excellent results</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Status and progress of data evaluation</head><p>We aim to include these data in a wider publication concerning the solid state structure-optical property relationship of a series of organic semiconducting materials, once the dataset is fully analysed.</p><p>We thank Oleg Konovalov and Maciej Jankowski for the excellent support as local contacts during the beamtime.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Chengyuan Wang*, Alexander Hinderhofer*, Lena Merten*, Frank Schreiber Institut für Angewandte Physik -Universität Tübingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 10, 72076 Tübingen, Germany Report:</figDesc></figure>
