The measurements combined ex-situ investigations of previously systematically prepared glass-metal nanocomposites of different thermal histories and investigations, where thermally activated nanoparticle formation was followed in-situ with the aim to describe the kinetics of particle formation and to derive informations for ionic motion in the respective glass matrix.</p><p>The dependency of Palladium solubility in x SO 3 -(38.01-x) P 2 O 5 -42.2 ZnO -19.79 Na 2 O (mol%) glass matrix was successfully described. It was found that Palladium solubility is decreased with increasing SO 3 content. This supports the idea of an increased tendency for particle formation in ionic sulfophosphate glasses. The ex-situ investigation of a previously heat treated Palladium doped glass series suggests Palladium operating as nucleating agent for matrix sulfate crystallization which seems to overlay particle formation.</p><p>In-situ investigations concentrated on thermal activated Silver nanoparticle formation in 19.11 SO 3 -18.9 P 2 O 5 -42.2 ZnO -19.79 Na 2 O -0.6 Ag 2 O (mol%, nominal) glass. Nucleation and crystallization of metallic silver could be followed seperately from matrix crystallization events.</p><p>Silver nanoparticle formation appears to be related to the structural relaxation around T g ~ 290 °C.</p><p>The activation energy of thermal activated silver nanoparticle formation was estimated from the combined WAXS-SAXS measurements to E a = 175 kJ mol -1 . Porod analysis between 0.1 nm -1 &lt; Q &lt; 0.82 nm -1 indicates a non fractal system with a Porod slope of ~ -4, which is in consistance with a distinc heterogeneity of the original glass <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. During particle formation with temperature Porod slope increases constantly indicating the development of fractal objects.</p><p>Unfortunately matrix crystallization activation energy could not be quantified but seems to occur at lower temperatures than for undoped glass of the same basic composition. It must be noted that a serious amount of hydrated phosphate crystall phase (Na 2 (PO 3 OH)•2(H 2 O), Dorfmanite, ICSD 1289) was detected. This is attributed to the experimental requirement of having powedered sample for in-situ investigation which is not ideal for hygroscopic, surface crystallizing glasses.</p><p>Additional to the proposals program, some test measurements on glass samples in the systems xSrO-(1-2x)MnO-xB 2 O 3 , xSnO-(100 -x)P 2 O 5 and vitreous SiO 2 with varying water content were carried out to evaluate the feasability of SAXS measurements on these glasses. Unfortuantely internal tensions, chemical heterogeneity of the glasses, or insufficient set up (to high Q-space) complicate the evaluation of the data. Therefore, special care should be taken on these issues regarding future proposals. </p></div>			</div>
