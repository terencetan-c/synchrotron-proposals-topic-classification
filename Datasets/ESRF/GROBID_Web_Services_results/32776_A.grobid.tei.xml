<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The nanostructural evolution during heat treatments of DC magnetron-sputtered Ag films, deposited at room temperature at different substrate bias voltages, was experimentally studied. The thermal stability of the nanostructure was sensitively dependent on the substrate bias voltage. Increasing the bias voltage resulted in significantly lower rates of grain growth, which we ascribe mainly to the formation of Ar bubbles. Furthermore, the grain size in the as-deposited films decreased with increasing bias voltage while the width of the one-dimensional pole figures (measured ex situ) increased.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>The nanocrystalline (nc) Ag thin films were synthesized by DC magnetron sputtering in the ROBL in-situ growth chamber <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The relevant parameters had been: base pressure ≈7×10 -5 Pa; Ar (purity 99.9996%) was used as sputter gas at a pressure of 0.5 Pa and a flow rate of 4 sccm; the substrates, mounted on a resistive heater, were Si(001) wafers (14×14 mm 2 ) with a 100 nm amorphous SiO 2 layer on top. The films were deposited at RT under different bias voltages (-50 V, -150 V, -250 V). The x-ray wavelength had been λ = 0.950 Å (13.051 keV).</p><p>During film deposition and subsequent annealing, Bragg-Brentano θ-2θ scans were carried out repeatedly (only planes parallel to the film surface probed). The integrated peak intensities reveal information about the texture and crystallinity, and the exact positions of the Bragg peak yield information about the out-ofplane lattice distance. From the shape and width of the diffraction peaks, out-of-plane average grain sizes and microstrain (rms strain) can be obtained. The diffraction peaks were fitted using a pseudo-Voigt peak profile, from which Gaussian β G and Lorentzian β L constituents to the total integral breadth were calculated according to a method described by de Keijser et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The Bragg-Brentano peak profiles were found to be close to purely Lorentzian, i.e. the microstrain was negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>The table gives results obtained from in-situ Bragg-Brentano x-ray diffractograms shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> of three Ag films. Tabulated are the integrated intensities I (111) , the ratio I (111) /I (002) , and the (111) grain size for the as-deposited films and after 80 min. annealing at 81°C (for comparison, I (111) /I (002) = 2.5 for a Ag powder).</p></div>

For Cu <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> this was explained by decreasing defect concentrations (larger bias results in more energetic ion bombardments of the growing film, which, in turn, make the surface atoms more mobile, whereby the defect concentration in the form of vacancies decreases). As a result, the driving force for grain growth due to recrystallization also decreases. In the case of Ag, however, the build-up of Ar atoms, which formed Ar bubbles, is dominating the reduction of the grain growth (some of the Ar bubbles were spread over the interior of the grains, slowing down the recrystallization process, while others decorated the grain boundaries, reducing the grain boundary mobility due to pinning).</p><p>[1] W.

Some decorate the grain boundaries while others are found in the interior of the grains. A few Ar bubbles were also observed in the films grown with -150 V bias, while in -50 V biased films no bubbles were detected. Ar bubbles were not observed in previously studied Cu films <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.
