<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Within the oil and gas industry, internal corrosion of carbon-steel due to CO 2 -saturated solutions, commonly known as sweet corrosion, is of widespread concern. On this basis, significant effort has been applied to gain mechanistic insight into this phenomenon, which is driven by the dissolution of CO 2 in H 2 O to form an acidic solution; i.e.</p><p>CO 2 (g)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">⇌ CO 2 (aq) + H 2 O(l) ⇌ H 2 CO 3 (aq) ⇌ HCO 3 -(aq) + H + (aq)</formula><p>The resulting aqueous phase species stimulate corrosion primarily through supplying reactants for the cathodic process, i.e. H 2 (g) evolution. Iron dissolution (Fe(s) ➝ Fe 2+ (aq)) occurs at anodic sites. Solid corrosion products may also appear as a consequence of these various processes, with their formation dependent upon a range of parameters, e.g. pH and temperature. If adherent to the carbon steel substrate, such solids can significantly reduce the rate of corrosion, and so are integral to material sustainability. One specific area of interest is that of weld-joints, as such areas can be highly vulnerable to failure due to increased sweet corrosion rates. There, however, remains incomplete understanding of the mechanisms leading to this phenomenon, including the impact of local variations in scaling.</p><p>Typically, CO 2 -induced corrosion scales on carbon-steel are labelled as siderite (FeCO 3 ). However, these scales are almost certainly more complex. For example, a recent in situ grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) study conducted by our group at XMaS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has shown that whilst the primary scale component on a pipeline carbon-steel (X-65) was siderite (FeCO 3 ), chukanovite (Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 ) was also present. In addition, a so-called green rust carbonate (Fe 6 (OH) 12 CO 3 ) was apparent during the early period of immersion. The aim of this beam time was to undertake similar in situ measurements from an X-65 pipeline steel weld joint.</p><p>Utilising the well-defined synchrotron radiation (SR) beam spot, GIXRD scans of each region of the weldjoint (i.e. fusion zone (FZ), heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM)) were possible, facilitating analysis of scale composition across the weld as a function of immersion time.</p><p>The in situ GIXRD was undertaken employing SR from beam line BM28 (XMaS). For these measurements, a custom-made electrochemical-cell (E-cell), allowing both GIXRD and electrochemical corrosion rate monitoring, was mounted on the diffractometer stage. A photon energy of hν = 15 keV, and an incidence angle (α i ) of 3° were used for data acquisition.  Other features at low 2θ values can be assigned to the polyimide film that was used as an X-ray transparent window in the E-Cell. Annotation indicates that siderite (FeCO 3 ), chukanovite (Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 ), and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) are present on all three weld regions after 14.5 h of immersion, although their relative proportions vary with region, suggesting that local substrate variation influences scaling. We note that the appearance of Fe 3 O 4 is somewhat unexpected, and may be a result of X-ray induced radiolysis (further work is required to verify this hypothesis). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> displays plots of diffracted peak intensities as a function of immersion time for each corrosion product on the FZ, HAZ, and BM regions. These data provide insight into temporal scale evolution. For example, there appears to be an induction period of ~ 6 h prior to significant chukanovite scale growth, after which it grows most rapidly on the WZ region. Further analysis/interpretation of these data is underway. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): G.

The bottommost plot in this figure was acquired from the BM region directly after immersion (0 h); all three regions displayed a similar profile at 0 h. The peaks located at 23.6°, 33.5° and 42.1° are attributed to the substrate bulk (α-Fe). Other features at low 2θ values can be assigned to the polyimide film that was used as an X-ray transparent window in the E-Cell.
