<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to use Small Angle X-ray Scattering to determine the overall structure of two proteins belonging to the family of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins 1 (PfEMP1). The PFEMP1 proteins are expressed on the surface of the infected erythrocytes (IE) and serve as adhesion ligands that interact with a range of host cell receptors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed:</head><p>The experiments were conducted at three different visits to the ESRF.</p><p>The first visit took place 7 December 2009, and showed that the experiences gained during at MX1073 in terms of sample preparation and operation of the beamline had been most valuable. Measurements were carried out on a carefully prepared and purfied sample of VAR2CSA at five different concentrations.</p><p>Measurements were also performed for the antibodies that had been shown to specifically bind to the DBL3 and DBL5 domains of VAR2CSA, and for the 1:1 complexes of the antibodies and VAR2CSA. The SAXS measurements of the antibodies were very satisfactory showing that these were pure, and had a molecular structure of the expected size and shape. However the measurements on the complexes revealed that these had aggregated in our solutions. Similar difficulties (aggregation) with the samples encountered on measurements of complexes of VAR2CSA and its carbohydrate targets CSA and decorin. Unfortunately the beamline lost alignment after injection, which had an effect on the last measurements.</p><p>The beamtime made available for the second visit was significantly reduced, the ash cloud in Iceland caused a delay of the airplane. Due to the difficulties encountered with measurements on complexes with antibodies different approaches were used to assign the specific location of domains in the overall structural envelop of VAR2CSA. As we expected that the binding of fab fragments would be more specific we performed measurements on complexes of VAR2CSA and the fab fragments for DBL3 and DBL5. Though the measurements were improvements compared to the complexes with the full antibodies, the solutions of the complexes also showed aggregation. The other approach namely to perform measurements on truncated versions of VAR2CSA turned out to be more successful. We performed measurements at three different concentrations on two truncated constructs corresponding to DBL1-3 and DLB1-4, respectively. The sample of the latter was of very good quality.</p><p>To compensate for the late start of the previous visit an additional shift was used in connection with MX measurements. The purpose was to confirm the measurements carried out at the previous visit on DBL1-4 and to investigate another truncated construct of VAR2CSA ID1-DBL4. Both samples gave satisfactory results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained:</head><p>Scattering curves fit the expected statistics with respect to molecular weight estimated from the Bovine Serum Albumine standard kindly provided by the ESRF. In addition the statistics calculated from the inverse Fourier function fit the expected Mw and Volume for both VAR2CSA and for the truncated variants. We finally succeeded in unambiguously identifying the positions of DBL domains 1, 5 and 6 in the VAR2CSA particle by measuring the scattering curves for strategically truncated variants of the VAR2CSA protein. The latest results truncated versions of VAR2CSA and ID1-4 have led us able to propose a model for the arrangement of domains within the VAR2CSA shape density, which is in agreement with the immunological data. A manuscript is in preparation describing these results.</p><p>We would like to conclude this report by expressing our great satisfaction with the performance of ID14-3. In the course of our experiments it has been constantly improved, sample changer, detector etc. It has become an outstanding protein solution SAXS beamline (the best in the world!!) supported by an equally superb staff.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Stig Christoffersen, University of Copenhagen * Annette Langkilde, University of Copenhagen* Sine Larsen, University of Copenhagen*</figDesc></figure>
