<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histatin 5 and variants</head><p>The antimicrobial peptide Histatin 5 (Hst 5) has previously been determined to have a flexible structure. In this project, two variants (one with a shorter chain called C14 with 12 aa, and one with double the sequence called dHst5 with 48 aa) of Hst 5 (24 aa) have been investigated using SAXS to determine the form factor of the two variants. As shown in the top left figure in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> below, and there seem to be an effect of the chain length on the conformational ensemble. The difference in low Q, especially for dHst5 compared to the others, is indicative of different interparticle interactions, hence, that there is more aggregation in these samples. There is no clear effect from the salt concentration. The peptides seem to be unaffected by this. In the normalized Kratky plot shown below (top right), all peptides display mainly a flexible structure, but the shorter peptide C14 in 10mM NaCl is slightly more compact than the others. In the bottom Figure <ref type="figure">is</ref> shown the distance distribution, and as expected the maximum length of the peptide is largest for dHst5, followed by Hst5, and lastly C14. This trend also holds for the peak, which is the most populated size. The results shown below are obtained at a concentration of ~2mg/mL. Shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below are some parameters obtained from fitting. From the MW we can assume that all peptides (except Hst5 in 10mM NaCl) is slightly aggregated since they display a larger MW than the theoretical one.</p><p>0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Q (Å -1 ) 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 2 I(Q)/c (a.u) 2mg/mL comparison</p><p>C14, 1.979 mg/mL, 10mM NaCl C14, 1.981 mg/mL, 150mM NaCl Hst5, 1.463 mg/mL, 10mM NaCl Hst5, 1.73 mg/mL, 150mM NaCl dHst5, 1.9085 mg/mL, 10mM NaCl dHst5, 2.003 mg/mL, 150mM NaCl </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BvPgb1.2</head><p>This project focuses on Phytoglobin from sugar beet (BvPgb1.2) wild-type (WT) and a mutant (C86A), where a cysteine is exchanged for an alanine. Both proteins were measured (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>) at several concentrations and in presence and absence of 150 mM NaCl (all in 10 mM Tris pH 8.5). Both proteins are well folded globular proteins, as seen from Kratky plots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>). Both WT and C86A mainly assume a dimeric structure as supported by the dimensions of the pair-distance distribution functions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>) and the molecular mass calculated from I(0), with some monomeric structure present at low concentrations. With higher concentrations a larger proportion of both proteins exist in larger oligomeric structures (presumably tetramers, hexamers and octamers). The effect of salt on the association numbers was insignificant for both protein structures, however the mutation of cysteine 86 to alanine resulted in a larger association number of the protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>). This difference can be attributed to solventexposure of hydrophobic parts of BvPgb, when the otherwise buried cysteine 86 is exchanged with alanine.</p><p>0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 r (Å) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 P(r) Distance distribution  (C) p(r) for the WT has dimensions consistent with a primarily dimeric structure, however at the lowest concentration measured, some monomer is likely also present, as seen by the extra bump at small distances.
