<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The long term aim of this experiment is to determine the crystallographic structure of the membrane protein cytochrome b 6 f complex (cyt b 6 f) which catalyzes the transfer of electrons between the photosystem II and photosystem I in oxygenic photosynthesis, and couples this transfer with the translocation of proton through the thylacoid membrane. It is a membrane protein that contains 2x8 polypeptide chains with a molecular weight of ca 200000 Da. It is one of the last large complex protein of photosynthesis whose structure is still not known, although the soluble portions of the Rieske protein <ref type="bibr">(Carrell et al., 1999)</ref> and the cytochrome f <ref type="bibr">(Martinez et al. 1997</ref>) have already been determined. Some functional and structural homologies exist with the cytochrome bc 1 of the respiratory chain of mitochondria, whose structure is known(for a review see <ref type="bibr">Berry et al, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>During the previous experiments shifts we obtained crystals diffracting to 3.5 Å resolution. Since the crystal were very fragile, and needed slow progressive soaking in cryoprotective solution, we circumvent the problem by adding a mixture of cryoprotectant in the crystallisation solution. This produces crystals diffracting to 3.0 Å resolution and to collect data set to 3.14 Å resolution, with an overall Rsym 7.4 % (3.33 -3.14 Å 0.31 %) with a completeness of 98 %.</p><p>The first trial with crystals in heavy atom solutions were very deceptive yielding only porly diffracting crystals. However, when we introduced the above improvement, the crystal wistand much better the soaking procedure and 8 data sets could be collected, with two heavy atom showing some interesting Patterson maps (shifts <ref type="bibr">14-15.12.2002)</ref>. The data set exhibit a decent statistics for heavy atoms although a reduced resolution limit around 3.8 to 4.0 Å. Data analysis for an initial phasing are in progress.</p><p>We tried to use the Fe peak to help in the phasing process and locate the 5 Iron atoms of the native structure. However the first tested crystals were a bit to small, the expected signal is anyway low, and we had some difficulting in tuning the wavelength around the Fe peak.</p><p>Although, some further heavy atom will probably be necessary, this series of experiments seems to us very encouraging.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>4</head><figDesc>Local contact(s):Jean-Luc Ferrer, Richard Kahn, Franck Borel Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Daniel Picot CNRS UMR 7099 Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique Paris David Stroebel CNRS UMR 7099 Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique Paris Pierre-Damien Coureux Institut Curie Paris</figDesc></figure>
