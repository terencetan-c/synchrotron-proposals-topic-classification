<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have investigated the structure of a Re 4 Co catalyst which is highly active for ammonia synthesis at ambient pressure. For this work we utilised an in situ cell up to 600°C with XAS and XRD being obtained throughout the entire reaction in order to elucidate the speciation of cobalt and rhenium during the reaction. Also ex situ standards were analysed with XAS in order to accurately determine specific oxidation state changes of rhenium and cobalt during the reaction. In situ XAS measurements were performed at the cobalt k-edge and rhenium L 3 edge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experimentally, the Re 4 Co material was pre-treated for 2 hours under H 2 /N 2 (1:3) from room temperature to 600°C using a ramp rate of 10°C/min and flow rate of 60 ml/min. Next the temperature was reduced and ammonia synthesis reaction performed under H 2 /N 2 at 400°C. XAS and XRD scans were collected throughout the entire reaction. The procedure was then repeated using Ar/H 2 as the pre-treatment gas mixture and H 2 /N 2 was switched in at 400°C for the ammonia synthesis reaction.</p><p>We were able to specifically pin point the periods in the reaction profile in which significant changes in the material occur. Then apply this knowledge to acquire high speed EXAFS scans (one scan every ca. 6 seconds) to enable us to follow the reduction of the rhenium precisely (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Using a range of standards it was possible to elucidate the oxidation state changes of Co and Re during each stage of the reaction. It was found rhenium starts in the +7 oxidation state and reduces to metallic rhenium at ca. 500°C (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and remains in a 0 oxidation state throughout the entire reaction.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows XRD data for the material during different temperatures/time during the reaction. The availability of in situ XRD was highly beneficial to the project as it allows us to follow changes in the structure of the catalyst in the reactor. 10 15 Cou Figure 1: High ium Oxidation Figure 3: 5 20 unts (2 Speed EXAFS n State Change In Situ XRD f 25 30 S on Re L3 Edg es throughout R for Re4Co t2 t21 t14 t7 t0 ge Reaction Profi P t9 t84 t77 t70 t63 t56 t49 t42 t35 28 1 ile 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Q2 Q1 P 1</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FFigure</head><figDesc>Figure 2: Rhen</figDesc></figure>
