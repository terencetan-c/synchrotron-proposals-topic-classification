<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the Pb speciation at the surface (0.1-0.2 µm) and in the bulk (several µm) of lead based wall painting mock-ups treated with chemical and physical treatments (cold plasma and others) and compare the artificial alteration with naturally altered lead pigments coming from hystorical wall paintings. All of the investigated samples consist of lead pigments applied with a casein binder on a lime based mortar substrate (dimensions 2 x 2 x (0.2-0.5) cm 3 ). Three different lead based pigments where investigated: 1) lead white (2PbCO 3 •Pb(OH) 2 ) with a thickness of ca. 30-50 um;</p><p>2) red lead (Pb 3 O 4 ) with a a thickness of ca. 100 um; 3) plattnerite (PbO 2 ), which is a common lead pigments alteration, with a thickness of ca 200 um. The case studies consist of a small fragment of 2 x 2 x 1 mm 3 and a powder (measured in a borosilicate glass capillary of 1mm diameter) of altered lead pigment from a 17 th century wall painting from Sicily. The samples were allocated in the experimental chamber in dark condition and inert He at 0.5 bar and the experimental investigation proceeded operating X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Fluorescence mode with the simultaneous acquisition in Total Electron Yield mode (TEY) carried out at the Pb L 3 edge (13035 eV). For TEY a specific sample holder was used and carbon tape was applied at the edges of the paint mock-up to ensure electrical conduction between the paint layer and the sample holder. A Pb foil was located in a second experimental chamber for energy calibration purpose. No particular experimental issues occurred. During the experiment, some artifacts in the TEY acquisition connected to the refill procedures of the electron beam were noticed. Accordingly, a time constrain was inserted, so all the measurements where set to start just after the hourly refill. Measurement duration was optimised consequently. All the samples were successfully investigated (21) as well as a set of relevant standards (14). For some of the samples, although the very thick Pb layer, (with the paint layer between 100-200 um) the transmission signal was also detected and registered.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Maria Amelia Suzuki* -Institute of Heritage Science ISPC-CNR Cristiano Riminesi* -Institute of Heritage Science ISPC-CNR Francesco Di Benedetto* -Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra Univ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary survey of the obtained results</head><p>For the lead oxides (both red lead and plattnerite mock-ups) the preliminary analysis of the XANES spectra provided significant insights. These spectra are, however, of difficult interpretation as the XANES of all the most significant lead oxides compounds for our experiment are very similar (FIG1a). These similarities makes the evaluation difficult, so these samples will be the object of a further beamtime request at beamlines which provide higher energy resolution. Never the less even if small changes are observed, the difference between fluorescence and TEY on the red lead samples treated with plasma (with TEY spectrum often shifted towards higher energy levels) may suggest a partially more enriched layer of lead(IV) on the surface compared to the bulk (FIG1b), which is in agreement with the type of plasma treatment applied. In the case of basic lead carbonate mock-ups both XANES and EXAFS give significant information suggesting a structural change of the carbonate to oxides maintaining the lead(II) oxidation state (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), so it seems that the artificial alteration do not cause the formation of plattnerite. Regarding the case study with potentially altered hydrocerussite there are no features suggesting the presence of Pb(IV) as alteration product of lead white but it could be present in a very small percentage below the detection limit. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary conclusions</head><p>Performing XAS on the treated mock-ups provided description of the structure and chemical nature of Pb to cheracterize the effects of physico-chemical artificial and natural lead pigments alteration. The comparison of the fluorescence and TEY signals combined with the complementary in-house XPS measurements on the mock-up suggests a higly superficial action of the plasma and different alteration products depending on the starting lead based pigment. However for some samples a higher resolution and additionally a lower detection limit is required to better interpret the spectra where very small differences were detected.</p></div>			</div>
