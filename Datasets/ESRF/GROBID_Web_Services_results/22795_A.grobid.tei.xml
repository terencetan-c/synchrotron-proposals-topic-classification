<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5HSRUW</head><p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessively inherited disease caused by a mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes for the cAMP-regulated Cl channel in the apical membranes of epithelial cells. The pathophysiology of CF remains controversial, an an accurate description of Airway Surface Liquid (ASL) properties is critical to the rational design of therapies for cystic fibrosis and other airway diseases. Comparison of wild type and CF mice in terms of absolute ion concentrations in these compartments would provide a valuable experimental model to explore the pathophysiology of CF. The aim of the present experiment was to test the feasibility of mapping ion concentrations, particularly Na and Cl in blood, epithelial intracellular compartments, and in ASL. Male C57BL/6-j mice were anesthetized with inhaled Isoflurane. The lungs and heart were removed and immediately frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Tissue sections of 6 µm were prepared using a cryostat microtome, and maintained at -70ºC on Kapton foils. Tissue sections were slowly freeze-dried, and studied at ambient temperature under vacuum. Ion concentration mapping was performed using the scanning synchrotron radiation X-ray microscope on ID21 with a beam at 2.9 kev. The focused beam size was 1 µm × 1 µm at the focal plane. X-ray fluorecsence maps were obtained for S, P, Cl, and Na (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), in regions of interest centered on the tracheal epithelium. Since the samples were lyophilized, the ASL could not be evaluated. The Na x-ray fluorescence signal was weak; therefore prolonged integration times were required for mapping. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>)</head><figDesc>LJXUH D; lyophilized 6 µm unstained slice of trachea, optical microscope (×10 magnification) showing the lumen (/), the epithelium (H), and tracheal cartilage (&amp;), a 50×50 µm region of interest () centered on the tracheal epithelium (thikness ~ 18 µm) was scanned, E; elemental distribution of Cl in the region of interest, integration time: 3 sec/pixel F; elemental distribution of Na in the region of interest, integration time: 3 sec/pixel. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of Cl and Na mapping of the airway epithelium, in tissue slices. Further work will be necessary to obtain data on ion concentrations in the ASL. For this purpose a low temperature sample environment is currently under study. An enhancement of the incident photon flux will be necessary for quantitative mapping of Na concentrations. The experimental setup could be improved in the near future for this reason, by the design and use of multilayers instead of Si(1,1,1) crystals in the monochromator.</figDesc></figure>
