<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Imaging sulfur oxidation state of Archaean and modern micro-fossils from submarine hot springs: A clue toward the understanding of the origin of life </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experiment ME-316 aimed at characterizing the oxidation state of sulfur in individual fossilized microfilaments from a black smoker of the East Pacific rise and from a very old hydrothermal system of Archaean age (3.5 billion year old) from the Sulfur Spring Deposit (Western Australia). The main objective was to evaluate if high-resolution micro-XANES analysis at the sulfur edge energy allowed identifying the sulfur redox distribution at a filament scale, which in turn could be interpreted in terms of a biogenic signature inherited from the past activity of sulfur-metabolizing microorganisms.</p><p>Central to this approach was to perform analysis of a large variety of standards in order to calibrate the Sedge energy. For this reason, an important part of the beam time has been dedicated to the analysis of pure standard products. These include : S, FeS, FeS 2 , FeSO 4 , Fe 3 2 (SO 4 ) 3 , Fe 0.8-1 S, CuS, CuSO 4 (Cu,Fe)S, FeCuS 2 , ZnS, (Zn,Fe)S, ZnSO 4 , NiSO 4 , CaSO 4 , methionine, cystine and cysteine.</p><p>The structure of the S K absorption edge was scanned in the near edge region. Incident beam energies from 20 eV below the main absorption edge energy of sulfate (2,482 eV for S 6+ ) to 20 eV above the main edge were used. The microscope used a Fresnel zone-plate as a focusing lens and delivered a microbeam of 1µm 2 with a measured photon flux of about 10 8 photon/s.</p><p>In order to visualize the internal structure of the microfilament, we mapped out the filaments along their long dimension and then acquired X-ray absorption spectra for each area defined. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a typical X-ray spectra obtained on a fragment of a filament together with the different maps performed at 2,471 eV (sulfide and/or SH-radicals), 2, 478 eV(sulfide and/or SH-radicals) and 2,482 eV(sulfate). Recognition that the maps at 2,471 and 2,472 eV show different distribution of sulfur species indicates that both sulfide and SH-radicals are present in the filament. These results suggest that high-resolution microXANES analysis of the oxidation state and local environment of sulfur in individual microfilaments could be used as a new tool for constraining their biogenic origin. With regards to Archaean microfilaments, however, we failed to extract any plausible information in terms of the redox distribution of sulfur because the host matrix contained important content of sulfate (Barite). Our objective in the future ould be to perform the same appraoch described above but on filaments preserved in cherts, which are analogous to the opale coating matrix of the East Pacific Rise filaments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): P.
