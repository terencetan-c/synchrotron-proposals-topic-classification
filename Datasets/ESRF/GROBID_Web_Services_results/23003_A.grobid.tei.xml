<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We were originally scheduled on ID29 to carry out MAD data collection but due to problems with that station were given time on ID14 EH2. An added complication was the failure of FEDEX to transport our cryo-stored samples to ESRF. Fortunately we travelled with many samples taken for screening and as a backup we also had put down crystallisation conditions on our previous trip to ESRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The bifunctional methylerythritol phosphate cytidyltransferase -methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate synthase (MECS).</head><p>After exhaustive crystallisation trials with a lot of work done on the home lab we can now reproducably get ordered crystals. Previously, native crystals only diffracted to between 3 and 3.5 Å, SeMet samples only between 4 and 5 Å at ESRF. Time was used to screen all the crystals, to collect several datasets and we have now obtained significant improvements to our data.</p><p>Native data now extends to 2.3 Å, 98% complete, Rsym 6.8% with redundancy of 19. Unit cell is a=b=108.8, c=161.3 Å, space group P6 3 22. The enzyme contains zinc and we have tried to locate the metal from the weak anomalous signal but so far without success. The SeMet derivative now extends to 2.9 Å, 100% complete, Rsym 10.3% with redundancy of 38. Unit cell a=b=107.7, c=161.0 Å, space group P6 3 22. Attempts to derive phases using a SAD or SIRAS approach have so far failed and we now plan a MAD experiment targeting the SeMet protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complex of methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate synthase with a novel inhibitor.</head><p>The crystals of this sample are frequently twinned, numerous crystals were tried, two datasets measured one of which has processed satisfactorily to 2.10 Å. 100% complete, Rsym 8.3% with redundancy of 4. Unit cell a=88.8, b=54.2, c=118.3, α=γ=90, β= 95.2º, space group P2 1 . Structure solved by molecular replacement and refinement is nearing completion with current R and Rfree of 21 and 26% respectively. The inhibitor is well ordered in the active site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thioredoxin from Trichomonas vaginalis.</head><p>As part of a new project to study redox metabolism in this parasite we have generated crystals of one component of the pathway, the thioredoxin. Crystals are thin rods often clumped together but we were eventually able to isolate a fragment that gave data to 2.0 Å. Unit cell a=34.2, b=34.1, c=50.9 Å, α=70º, β= 73º, γ=88º, space group P1. Rsym 3.5%, 91% complete with redundancy of near 2. Data awaits use in molecular replacement calculations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) from Leishmania major.</head><p>In a new project to investigate aspects of sulfur utilization in parasitic trypanosomatids we are studying MST. Unit cell =b=109.6, c=67.3 Å, space group P4 2 2 1 2, 100% complete to 2.2 Å, Rsym 4.8% with redundancy of 8. A SAD approach has solved this structure based on the Se anomalous signal. 12 Se sites were located and gave a FOM of 0.3 which improved to 0.8 after density modification. The map was manually interpreted and refinement of the SeMet form is nearing completion. Current R and Rfree of 23 and 29% respectively. Unexpectedly we see covalent modification of the active site cysteines and note that the C terminal extension not present in homologues, forms a separate domain not seen in this class of enzyme. The functional significance of these observations will now be further investigated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Chemistry and Molecular Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, DD1 5EH, Tayside, UK.</figDesc></figure>
