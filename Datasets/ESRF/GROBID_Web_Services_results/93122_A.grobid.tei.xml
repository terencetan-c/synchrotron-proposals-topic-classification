GreA is involved in transcriptional proof reading and cleaves the RNA 3'-end to remove erroneous bases. The goal is to obtain reconstructions of RNA polymerase after it made a misincorporation in the nascent RNA transcript. We want to do this for all 4 possible misincorporation events (i.e. rATP, rUTP, rGTP, and rCTP). Our local contact was Eaazhisai KANDIAH and I traveled to the ESRF with a complex containing a misincorporated rATP. I brought several grids from a batch, which was pre-screened locally on a Glacios microscope. Even though the atlases for several grids looked good, we noticed problems when taking a closer look at the holes. We thus had to manually search through many squares and holes to identify suitable ones. This was tedious but our local contact was supportive and helped to select enough holes to collect a large dataset.</p><p>We had collected on RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation complexes before at the ESRF (February 2018, July 2018, and November 2018) and in each case obtained high-quality data. We have recently published a paper in Mol. Cell that contains reconstructions obtained from ESRF data. This is to say that we were extremely pleased with te quality of the data we have received so far and were looking forward to the results from this trip. Ayesha, a PhD student in my team, had spent some time on optimizing complex formation and gridfreezing protocols. I felt bad that the grids did not look better despite our efforts to screen them beforehand. The lesson learned for me is that it is not sufficient to collect atlases but we will also need to check a few squares and holes across the grid.</p><p>In the end, thanks to the support we got, we collected in total about 4420 micrographs and have picked more than 450.000 particles. After 2D classification and clean-up, Ayesha obtained an initial 3D reconstructions and was able to classify the particles further. At the moment she is able to reach a nominal resolution of about 3.9Å (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). She can see all the ligands (DNA, RNA, GreA) and also sees that the active site is in a new and unusual conformation, which had not been seen before. We have collected a dataset on the complex that misincorporated rUTP and see the same active site conformation. This is encouraging and very exciting. We now need to do reconstructions on complexes with rCTP and rGTP misincorporations. We hope to resolve some of the controversies in the field and maybe we will also be able to provide a structural explanation for the widely observed sequence dependent differences in the RNA cleavage rates. I have submitted a new proposal to the ESRF and am looking forward to receiving feedback on it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Preliminary reconstructions</head><p>After initial rounds of refinement in CryoSPARC, we obtained a reconstruction that refined to a nominal resolution of about 3.9Å. We can see density for the bound transcription factor, and nucleic acid ligands (not shown). In addition, we can see that the active site is in a new and unusual conformation. We are confident this will allow us to resolve some of the controversies in the field with respect to the role of elements such as the RNA polymerase trigger loop and its role in the cleavage reaction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,-47.58,156.54,608.53,205.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
