Beale* (UCL), David J. Martin* (UCL) Report:</p><p>Precious metal nanoparticles comprising Pt, Au, Pd etc. supported on light metal oxides (i.e. Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2) form the basis of many types of industrial heterogeneous catalyst systems. It is well known that nanoparticles actively respond to their environment in situ, often changing shape so as to maximize, for example, the contact area of a particular surface. Cutting edge synthesis techniques such as reverse micelle metal ion encapsulation, first demonstrated by Spatz et al., generate nanoparticle populations with suitably small particle size distributions (σ &lt;&lt; 1 nm), and critically, completely encapsulate all metal ions which prevents the development of sub-species by virtue of an water-in-oil system where solubility is fully controlled.</p><p>State of the art nano-beamlines such as the insertion device line ID16B-NA (ESRF) now possess the ability to perform conventional X-ray based techniques, such as XAS and XRD (X-ray diffraction), with extremely fine spatial resolutionwith beam sizes in the range of 10s of nanometers. In these exeperiments we tested a new reactor cell and measured some supported Pd catalysts under a controlled atmosphere (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). XAFS data were collected on two samples (Si3N4 window located on the reactor cell window) at 293 K under He flow, and under different atmospheres at 343 K (H2, O2, CO and a reactive mixture of CO and O2) using a 400 × 400 nm 2 square beam. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows XANES spectra of a sample as well as XANES spectra from a Pd foil. The data obtained for sample A-1 is noisy as the spectra is only collected from ca. 150 particles, however, it is clear that there are several characteristic "peaks" (continuum resonances and scattering features) primarily located at 24.36, 24.38 and 24.42 keV respectively, ascribable to metallic Pd. In summary we obtained uniform Pd nanoparticles using a reverse micelle synthesis method and demonstrated that it was possible to obtain spectroscopic information using a nanosized X-ray beam from as few as ~20 nanoparticles (we estimate) allowing us to analyse nanoparticle behaviour under various reactive gas atmospheres at fixed temperatures. These preliminary data presented here represents a first attempt to examine single nanoparticles, which could help remove statistical averaging effects that accompanies bulk XAS techniques. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The gas flows in from the heated tubing at the top, passes across the Pd-SiNx window and out through the bottom to exhaust. Two XRF detectors (single and multielement array) are positioned extremely close to the front-side window at ca. 15° to collect as high quality data as possible.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,99.10,86.50,397.00,221.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
