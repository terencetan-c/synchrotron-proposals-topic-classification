<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is possible to create stable liquid crystal colloidal suspensions using anisometric particles such as clay platelets. It is, however, difficult to predict which systems will result in stable suspensions as the affinity of the host solvent for the particle must be carefully optimised.</p><p>Claytone AF, a commercial quaternary ammonium surfactant treated montmorillonite with an aspect ratio of up to 1:2000, has been shown to self-organise into stacks in suspension with a characteristic spacing that depends on the solvent, but surprisingly does not change with concentration or temperature, i.e. the nematic or isotropic phase of the liquid crystal. For example, the spacing in 5CB is on average 37Å whereas the same particle suspended in MBBA results in a spacing of 48Å.</p><p>In order to determine which factors govern this spacing we suspended Claytone AF in two liquid crystalline solvents, 4-pentyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and n -4'-methoxybenzylidene-n-butylaniline (MBBA) and 10 other organic solvents with a range of molecular sizes, dielectric constants and refractive indices. We determined the spacing between suspended Claytone plates by small angle X -ray scattering (SAXS) measurements performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at beam line BMO2.</p><p>The measurements with samples in Lindemann capillaries were successful and the different spacings recorded can be seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This data allows us to explore the mechanism governing the self-organisation occurring within the suspensions. Surprisingly, the long chain alcohol suspensions used showed an alignment effect in the magnetic field similar to that observed in the liquid crystalline samples. The detector images for these measurements are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Unfortunately we were not as successful with the experiments involving confined geometries. The samples were contained in cells made from surface treated microscope cover slips spaced with 10 and 100 ? m spacer beads. The glass was so flexible that the cells actually bowed inwards and the two substrates were so close in the centre of the cell that the quantity of sample in this region was not sufficient to generate a scattering signal. In addition to the 200 samples prepared with microscope slides, we also examined 4 real display cells, i.e. switchable by an electric field, prepared from ITO glass of 1mm thickness. It was possible to use these rigid cells with the high energy X-rays available at beam line BM02 (18keV), however the sample thickness (10? m) was so weakly scattering before detector overflow occurred that very little signal was recorded. As a result, we have designed a new type of cell with a varying thickness across the cell.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
