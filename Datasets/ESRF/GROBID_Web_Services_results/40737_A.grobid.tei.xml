<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The pks genomic island of Escherichia coli encodes polyketide (PK) and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) synthases that allow assembly of a putative hybrid PK-NRP compound named colibactin that induces DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells. The pks-encoded machinery harbors an atypical essential protein, ClbP. We determined the crystal structure of the ClbP major domain, its biochemical activity, and we characterized distant ClbP homologous proteins that form a new subgroup of serine-reactive peptidases associated with NRP. The corresponding article (Dubois D., J Biol Chem 2011) has been the subject of comments in the section « Choice's of Editors » of the journal Science in 2012. The structure has been deposited at PDB databank (PDB ID: 3O3V).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main crystallographic results</head><p>To investigate the function and activity of ClbP, the structure of the ClbPpep domain was determined by x-ray diffraction at ESRF, Grenoble, France. The structure was refined against diffraction data extending to 2.4Å resolution. The electron density map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) showed well defined density throughout most of the structure, with the exception of the six N-terminal residues.

The final model included three ClbPpep monomers and 277 water molecules.</p><p>Table 1. Data collection and structure determination statistics for ClbPpep crystal structure.

The most pronounced homology using the DALI program was obtained with the structure of S12 family members, especially E. coli AmpC beta-lactamase and Pab87 peptidase. Although their overall fold was clearly similar, there are significant differences affecting the accessibility of the active site from the surrounding solvent. In comparison with AmpC β-lactamases, the upper part of the catalytic pocket was largely open, because of the absence of two helices (h9 and h10) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, A and E), as observed in Pab87 peptidase and R61 carboxypeptidase. Moreover, the remaining structural element of ClbP in this area, the loop between residues 295-315, b9, and b10 strands (residues 310 to 311 and 316-318, respectively), moved away from the catalytic pocket, resulting in a widening of the catalytic groove, which was unusually larger than the known structures of S12 enzymes. In the bottom part of the catalytic pocket, ClbPpep and Pab87 peptidases harbored the additional helix h4′ (residues 166-170) in contrast with AmpC enzymes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">A</ref> and <ref type="figure">E</ref>). This helix slightly obstructed accessibility to the ClbPpep catalytic pocket. However, the entrance of the binding site was more open in ClbPpep than in S12 peptidases, which harbor one, two, or several bulky helices in this area. Of note, between Cys-337 and Cys-367, ClbP harbored a disulfide bond, which links b12 strand (residues 335-341) with the C-terminal helix h11. To our knowledge, this disulfide bond is not observed in other known structures of S12 enzymes. Overall, the ClbPpep structure was closely similar to that of S12 peptidases. However, ClbPpep had noticeable conformational differences in the active site, especially in the two extremities of the catalytic groove, which was unusually large (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">B-D</ref>). This atypical shape suggests an adaptation of ClbP catalytic pocket to a specific substrate.</p><p>Structural similarities were observed between the active site of ClbPpep, class C betalactamases, and other S12 enzymes such as Pab87 peptidase, in particular, for the motif 95 SxxK and the Tyr-186 residue. The positioning of this last residue and the presence of His-327 make the ClbPpep active site very similar to that of Pab87 peptidase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, <ref type="figure">A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). In addition, the location and geometry of the residues Ser-95, Lys-98, and Tyr-186 suggest a direct role in the catalytic mechanism mediated by ClbP. To confirm the importance of these residues in ClbP, substitutions S95A, K98T, and Y186G were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis residues into His-tagged ClbP. The resulting mutants were assessed for their ability to restore the cytopathic activity of the pks-positive E. coli clbP isogenic mutant. Infected HeLa cells were analyzed for megalocytosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and phosphorylation of histone H2AX. None of these mutants were able to restore the cytopathic activity of the pks-positive E. coli clbP isogenic mutant in contrast with the wild-type ClbP protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, <ref type="figure">C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>). These results confirm the identification of the active site and the importance of ClbP main domain for the functionality of pks island. They also suggest that these enzymes and other S12 serine active-site enzymes share a catalytic mechanism. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, ClbP is a prototype of a new subfamily of extracytoplasmic serine-reactive peptidases probably acting as maturating enzymes for NRP compounds. The essential role of ClbP in the production of the biological effect make this protein a key target for the control of the bioactivity of the PK-NRP producing pks gene cluster, which may affect commensalism and/or pathogenicity and constitute a predisposing factor for the development of colorectal cancer. The engineering of NRP compounds should take into account these new catalytic units, which could be interesting tools for modifying the structures and bioactivity of NRP and PK-NRP compounds and be a target for identifying bioactive molecules.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
