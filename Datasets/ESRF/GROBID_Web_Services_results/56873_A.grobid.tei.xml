If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. combines a Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) inorganic phase for Li-ion transport and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) polymer for water-tightness. The Li-ion transport through the membrane is ensured by an interconnected 3D network of crystalline LATP fibers obtained by combining an electrospinning process coupled with the sol-gel synthesis. After an impregnation step with PVDF-HFP, hybrid membranes with different volume fractions of PVDF-HFP have been synthesized. These membranes are water tightness and have Li-ion conductivities ranging from 10 -5 to 10 -3 mS/cm. The conductivity depends on the alignment of the fibers in the membrane thickness, the relative humidity in the electrospinning chamber and the PVDF-HFP volume fraction. Taking into account the porosity of the LATP fiber mat, a conductivity value of 10 -1 mS/cm is calculated, comparable to dense LATP fibers, confirming the excellent nature of the 3D LATP network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The incident photon energy was tuned to 11 keV which corresponds to a wavelength of λ= 1.12 Å. A twodimensional detector, a CDD camera developed by Princeton, presently Ropper Scientific, was used. The magnitude of the scattering vector is defined as q=(4π/λ)sinθ, where θ is half of the scattering angle and λ is the wave length. The distance from the sample to the detector was 164cm, which covers the q range from 0.06 to 1.56 nm -1 . The corrections of primary data were carried out using the software Bm2Img available on the beamline: (i) the dark current (i.e. non-illuminated camera), (ii) the flat field response (i.e. homogeneously illuminated camera), and (iii) the tapper distortion. The standard silver behenate was used for the q-range calibration. 2D images were converted into radial averages over the image center to yield the scattered intensity I vs. the scattering vector q.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A SAXS analysis, showing the homogeneity of the fiber mat before and after impregnation is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The fiber mats (b, c) before impregnation give a featureless SAXS intensity, regardless of the humidity used during the electrospinning process. After impregnation (d), the spectrum exhibits, at high q, a broad correlation peak (around q = 0.85 nm -1 ) related to the organization of the PVDF-HFP crystalline domains. This correlation length is attributed to the distance between the crystallites of the semi-crystalline polymer phase considering a sufficient electronic contrast between the amorphous and the crystalline phases. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> The semi-crystalline polymer phase can be treated as lamellar systems. The lamellar period is the sum of the average widths of the lamellae and amorphous layers. In the present case this value is 7.4 nm. The spectrum of pure PVDF-HFD fibers without LATP (a) is also represented as a reference. In the unsintered fiber mat (d), the peak is broader than the pure PVDF-HFP fibers (a), which would suggest a higher dispersion of the characteristic correlation lengths of PVDF-HFP crystallite domains. In all cases, at low q, the graphs (log(abs. int.) vs. log(q)) show a straight line, which corresponds to a q -x evolution (where x is about 4). This behavior tends to highlight, according to Porod's law, the existence of a sharp and smooth interface between air and the material at a nanoscale. Please note that the evolution is not modified after impregnation of the membrane, which suggests that the nanostructure is intact after calcination and impregnation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
