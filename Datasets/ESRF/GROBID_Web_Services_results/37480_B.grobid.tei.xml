Tieg *ESRF (2) H. L. Meyerheim *[MPI f. Mikrostrukturphysik, D-06120 Halle (Germany)] (3) C. Tusche *[MPI f. Mikrostrukturphysik, D-06120 Halle (Germany)] (4) Ioana POPA* (ESRF) Report:</p><p>We have proposed a surface x-ray diffraction (SXRD) study of the geometric structure of ultrathin Ni 50 Mn 50 films deposited on Cu(001) at room temperature. Layers of 2, 4, 6 and 8 monolayers (ML) in thickness were prepared.</p><p>Complete datasets including superlattice (SL) and integer order crystal truncation rods were collected, however due to the limited beam intensity provided by the bending magnet, only the data of the thicker films (6 and 8 ML) allowed a meaningful analysis. Furthermore, even for these layers important details of the structural ordering escape from a clear-cut determination, which are very important for the interpretation of the magnetic properties of this system <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. For this reason we are resubmitting a proposal to continue the experiment asking for beamtime at an undulator beamline. In the following we show the most important results on the basis of the 8 ML sample: (b) SL rod (a) [110]</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(a) and (b) show the basic structure model and the corresponding reciprocal lattice, respectively <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We chose the setting corresponding to the face-centered Cu(001) surface unit cell. In the model it is assumed that there are alternating sheets of Ni (small spheres) and Mn (large spheres) along the [100] direction, according to the CuAu-type structure of bulk MnNi. The chemical order leads to the apperance of extra diffraction spots (circles) at positions (H+K=2n+1, n integer) due to the lifting of the centering of the 2D unit cell. The intensity I at theses SL diffraction spots is proportional to the (squared) difference between the scattering amplitudes: I∝(f Mn -f Ni ) 2 . Chemical disorder leads to an intensity decrease of the SL reflections relative to the truncation rods resulting from the occupancy mixing of the lattice sites and the corresponding averaging of the f-values. Chemical disorder is characterized by local antisite defects and/or by stacking faults as shown in the topmost layer in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. Apart from a general expansion of the interlayer spacings by 1-2% relative to the Cu(001) bulk spacing, our SXRD data provide evidence for an unexpected layer-dependent chemical disorder as as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> The order parameter (S) is plotted vs. the layer number. The values S=0 and S=1 indicate complete disorder and order, respectively. It can be seen that S increases from low values at the Cu/NiMn interface to S=1 at the topmost two (incomplete) layers. Although a similar trend is observed for the 6 ML sample also, models allowing for NiMn intermixing with Cu at the interface by simultaneously assuming a more ordered structure (S≈0.65) throughout the film lead to fits of similar quality (Ru≈0.10). The difficulty to distinguish between these models is due to the low accuracy of the high-q SL data as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> on the right panel. The limited primary beam intensity does not allow the collection of SL intensities accurate enough to derive an unambiguous structure model. However, the precise determination of the Mn/Ni-order profile is a prerequisite for the understanding the striking magnetic properties of these alloy films. Examples are the appearance of antiferromagnetic order beyond 8 ML coverage and the observation of a non-collinear surface spin density <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>References: |F| [arb. units] 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 L [rec. latt. units] HKL = (22L) 10 -1 10 0 10 1 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 L [rec. latt. units] HKL = (30L) Fig.3: Structure factor amplitude along a high-q crystal truncation rod (left) and supperlattice rod (right) for 8 ML MnNi/Cu(001).
