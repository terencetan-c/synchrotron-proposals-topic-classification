<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Report:</head><p>InGaN quantum dots are used for high emittance photonic devices with a tunable output in the blue, green and ultraviolet spectral range. They are mostly grown by Metal-Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). The Indium incorporation in the InGaN quantum dots is very important for improving their luminescence efficiency and for tuning the wavelength. For a good device a GaN capping layer with high crystalline quality is required. One difficulty is that InGaN quantum dots grown in Stranski-Krastanow (SK) mode are dissolving during overgrowth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Therefore, a new method has been introduced to form the quantum dots directly on the top of the buffer layer. A thin nucleation layer is deposited with a layer thickness below the critical thickness for island formation in SK mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>We have measured a series of samples in order to study the growth evolution of InGaN quantum dots in different stages of formation process. The samples consist of a 2μm thick GaN(0001) buffer layer deposited by MOVPE on the c-plane sapphire. On top of this buffer, about 2nm InGaN is deposited which evolutes into island-like structures (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Several samples have been capped by either InGaN formation layer with lower concentration of indium, or GaN. Additionaly, one sample has a 36nm thick capping layer of GaN on the surface. The growth conditions during growth are varied <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The experiments have been performed at the beam-line ID01, ESRF (synhrotron radiation energy of 7.75keV), using a MaxiPix 2D detector with evacuated flight tube in front. To avoid air scattering and damage of the samples due to reactions with ozone, the samples have been measured under helium atmosphere. We have performed grazing incidence diffraction (GID) which is sensitive to the lateral lattice parameter distribution. Measurements were done on the reflections from the planes sitting perpendicular to the sample surface. Samples were mounted verticaly to use σ-polarization of the synchrotron radiation which gives more intense beam. Therefore, "hphi" motor was used as a sample "theta" and detector motor "del" as a "two thetha". In detail, radial and angular scans in grazing incidence geometry have been measured. Radial scan means performing the "θ-2θ" scan in the direction of chosen reflection moving simoultaneously "hphi" motor by half of the step of "del" motor. Angular scan means scanning by moving just one motor "hphi", while "del" motor stays at the fixed position fullfilling the Bragg condition. Position of "hmu" motor defines the incidence angle and "nu" brings detector in the position above the exit angle to collect intensity integrated in the z-direction. Furthermore, penetration depth dependend measurements in GID geometry have been performed in a sense that we have performed the same radial and angular scans applying a different angle of incidence. Additionaly, reciprocal space map (q radial -q angular ) on few of the samples have been measured. In GID geometry, (10-10) and (20-20) reflections were measured to compare two orders of diffraction. Each reflections was repeated in three different azimuthal orientations.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. shows two radial scans measured at different incidence angle, below (black line) and above (red line) the critical angle. Below the critical angle, at α i =0.25°, penetration depth was 2nm and above the critical angle, at α i =0.5° was 200nm. Scattering from the vicinity close to the surface form a separate peak named InGaN(1) which is getting less pronounced changing the shape by getting deeper in the film.</p><p>On the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. it is shown the comparison between the samples with same growth temperature, but different layer structure. Blue and green lines mark Bragg positions of pure GaN and pure InN, respectivly. On both diffraction profiles one can observe a sharp GaN peak coming from the thick buffer layer and well separated InGaN(2) peak corresponding to the alloy with nominaly 85% of indium. Scan on the sample with overgrown quantum dots (orange line) have a broad intensity distribution between these two peaks coming from overgrowing material of InGaN, which is even forming separate peak. Scan on the sample with freestanding quantum dots (black line) shows just a second component below the GaN peak what may indicate that quantum dots, which suppose to have 10-20% of In, are not completely strained to the substrate. InGaN(2) peak is shifted to the position of GaN in both cases of overgrowing either by GaN or by InGaN. We have measured angular scans (rocking curves) at the positions of the GaN, InGaN(1) and InGaN(2) peaks on all of the samoples and for both (10-10) and (20-20) reflections.</p><p>The strain, size and misorientation components are overlaped with the change of composition and therefore we will develop a model of freestanding and overgrown InGaN quantum dots including different shape, size and misorientation and fit calculated intensity distribution to the measured one. Further, comparing the results of GID study to EXAFS and AFM results measured on the samples should help to answer on the real structure of investigated materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
