<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: 1) Preparations and Setup:</head><p>We brought our own sample manipulator to ID19, since the combination of X-ray diffraction laminography (XDL) and rocking curve imaging (RCI) requires sample motion in specific degrees of freedom which are not provided by regular tomography setups. We successfully mounted our device onto the medium resolution tomography setup at ID19 which served as a base-structure to align our instrumentation with respect to the incoming X-ray beam. We were able to integrate all motors into the beamline control system and achieve the high level of precision in real and angular space needed for our measurements. With kind support of ID19 staff we realized a tilt of the detector (provided by ID19) in order to align the detector plane perpendicular to the diffracted X-ray beam, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Furthermore, we brought a mirror furnace for the sample annealing with a stand-alone control system that enabled in situ monitoring of the temperature profile on the wafer during the heating treatment via termocouples and an infra-red camera.</p><p>2) Measurements: Two silicon samples with suited damages (introduced by nanoindentations with loads of 350 to 400 mN) underwent the proposed measurement scheme: The wafers were scanned by RCI with varying azimuth angle in Bragg reflection geometry to capture the 3D information about the initial strain in the material around the damage sites, see Fig 2. During a gradual annealing intermediate XDL/RCI-scans were performed in Laue transmission geometry to provide snap-shots of the emerging dislocation arrangements in different development stages, see Fig 3. The pattern shown in Fig. 3 emerged around the indent marked with a red triangle in Fig 2.</p><p>After completion of this first measurement campaign we continued with a complex dislocation pattern in a previously annealed silicon wafer. We also applied XDL to a silicon transistor array and a silicon carbide wafer (SiC). For the first time a socalled micro-tube in SiC was imaged with XDL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Data Quality and Results</head><p>The high image quality of the acquired dataalso owed to the outstanding beam properties at ID19fulfilled our expectations. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.a) exemplarily shows projection data from XDL acquisitions of an emerging dislocation pattern during the gradual annealing. We clearly see the individual dislocation lines in each step of the successive heating treatment. The data quality also allows the 3D reconstruction of more complex dislocation arrangements. As a preliminary intermediate result Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.b) shows the reconstructed 3D crystal volume at the three development stages corresponding to the projection data above, compare Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.a). The evolution progess during one heating step could be controlled in a way that allows to identify individual dislocations in their different stages.</p><p>Here, to trace the individual dislocation lines in their step-wise progression they were marked in different colors. Screening and quality inspections of the data up to now lead to the conclusion that the quasi in-situ application of XDL was successful. The acquired RCI data sets will enable the correlation of initial strain properties with the 3D structure of the dislocation arrangments and their dynamics during the heating treatment. The analysis on this topic is ongoing. Furthermore, the extensive data sets are also suited to enable fundamental theoretical considerations, which is especially owed to the combination of XDL with RCI. In a feasibility study we have demonstrated the applicapability of XDL to SiC. Futhermore, the obtained data may give new insight on the properties of micro-tubes in this material. In summary, we conclude that the experiments were very sucessful and that the acquired data will provide information and results that will be published in peer-reviewed journals in the near future. Support and contributions of ESRF staff will be acknowledged accordingly.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Mobile X-ray diffraction imaging setup integrated in ID19 tomography setup and tilted detector system.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,343.50,480.00,223.45,271.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
