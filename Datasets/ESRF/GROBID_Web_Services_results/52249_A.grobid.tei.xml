Both compounds present dimerised anions. In first compound this dimerization appears however disordered with the Co atom distributed over two possible positions and with lack of correlation between the dimerization in nearby anionic chains. The structure is closely related with spin-ladder compound previously mentioned, but with a slightly different molecular packing with donors almost perpendicular to the stacking axis. These results are presently under publication. Summary of crystal data.
