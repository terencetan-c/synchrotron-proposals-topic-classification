<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Before starting the beamtime using for the CH-6562 experiment, the corresponding glaswere and the X-raytransparent electrochemical flow cell (EFC) components were cleaned with a H2SO4:H2O2 mixture and thoroughly washed in Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm, TOC &lt; 3 ppb). Thereafter, the EFC was assambled and mounted, see Figue 1. The electrocatalytic ink was prepared by ultrasounding ca. 3.6 mg of the electrocatalyst powder (the metal content was determined previously by ICP-MS) in 3.990 mL of Milli-Q water, 1 mL of isopropanol and 10 μL of Nafion® 5% v/v. Thereafter, 20 μL of the resulting suspension were carefully deposited onto a glassy carbon rod (0.196 cm 2 ) and dried at room conditions by rotating the electrode, obtaining a Pt loading of ca. 20 μgPt cm - 2 geo. Fresh electrolyte (0.1 M HClO4, Suprapur®, Merck) was prepared prior to each sample measurement and flowed constantly through the EFC at 20 mL min -1 using a peristaltic pump. The counter-electrode was a graphite rod and the reference electrode a commercial leak-free miniature Ag/AgCl electrode (ET072, eDAQ). The reference electrode was calibrated using a Pt electrode submerged in H2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4. All potentials in this report are referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. The EFC was controlled with a Biologic potentiostat SP300. After the mounting of the sample in the EFC and the electrolyte flowing, the working electrode potential was kept at the open circuit potential (OCP) prior to any measurement. Simultaneously, the X-ray beam was carefully aligned, reaching a high signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Once the X-ray beam has been aligned, the electrochemical test protocol started with electrode preconditioning (or electrochemical activation) procedure, consisting of potential cycling between 0.05 and 0.95 VRHE at 100 mV s -1 for 20 cycles. WAXS patterns were simultaneously collected with 1 s temporal resolution.  Following the electrochemical activation protocol, three potentiodynamic cycles, under the same potential rage at 20 mV s -1 , where recorded, and simultaneously, the WAXS patterns were acquired, but with higher temporal resolution (250 ms exposure time). The refinement of the structural data extracted form this experiment allow us to follow the evolution of the lattice parameter and, therefore, the induced strain as function of the potential, namely, the nanocrystal strain variations associated with electrochemical adsorption processes on the electrode.</p><p>It is worth to mention that, due to the effect of the chemical nature of the electrolyte on the adsorption processes at the electrode/electrolyte interphase, we have done the comparison between the strain dynamics in acidic (0.1 M HClO4) vs. alkaline (0.1 M KOH) medium, an example of which is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. The preliminary results shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> clearly testify for the effect of the pH on the potential-depended strain dynamics. This captured electrolyte effect on the strain dynamics might be the subjet of a coming publication.</p><p>The stability of the electrocatalysts under study was explored using an accelerated stress test (AST) protocol in 0.1 M HClO4. The AST consisted of 5,000 potential steps cycles (3s at 0.6 VRHE + 3s at 0.95 VRHE) under O2saturated electrolyte, and the WAXS patterns were measured at cycle number 0, <ref type="bibr">100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000.</ref> At the end of the AST, three potentiodynamic cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 VRHE at 20 mV s -1 were recorded in O2-saturated electrolyte in order to calculate the electrochemical strain dynamics at the end of the AST.</p><p>The protocol in 0.1 M HClO4 described above was applied to a series of Pt-RE/C nanoalloys (RE= Y, Sm or Gd), as well as the Pt/C benchmark. Besides, the measurements of the strain dynamics in 0.1 M KOH was applied to a series of Pt-RE/C nanoalloys (RE= La, Ce or Nd), as well as the Pt/C benchmark. All the acquired images during the beamtime were reduced to diffraction patterns using the pyFAI software package, and the resulting patterns are being analysed using FullProf software and Rietveld refinement. The refinement and analysis of the obtained results are in progress so far, and we expect they might strongly support complementary characterization for two coming publications.</p><p>The information extracted during the CH-6562 experiment, coming along with supplementary characterization, will shade light on consistent structure-activity-stability relationships for the Pt-RE family of alloys, which remain poor understood at the nanoscale and is essential to accomplish their potential applicability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Univ.
