<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiments was to study the electronic and magnetic properties of 3d transition metal impurities, e.g. Fe and Mn adatoms on topological insulators (TI) Bi 2 Te 3 , Bi 2 Se 3 , also doped with Fe and Mn. The surface of TIs reveals unique properties compared to TI bulk : although the bulk is insulating, metallic states are present on the surface. For this reason, we wanted to check whether the TI surface modifies the magnetic and electronic properties of adsorbed atoms and confirm theoretically predicted out-of-plane easyaxis for adsorbed atoms. To this end, the impurities were either adsorbed on the TI surface or diluted in the TI's bulk.</p><p>Before XMCD experiments, samples were cleaved in-situ in the ID08's preparation chamber at room temperature. The deposition rate of 3d transition metals were calibrated on a W(110) surface by means of STM. The impurities were deposited on the TIs at 10K before the XAS spectra were taken. Measurements were performed with and without magnetic fields, at angles of 0 o and 70 o with respect to the surface normal, while temperatures were varied between 10K and 300K.</p><p>We select in the following two sets of samples as a summary to show that we could address the points mentioned above. Firstly, we discuss Mn adatoms adsorbed on Bi 2 Te 3 and compared them to diluted Mn atoms in a Bi 2 Te 3 crystal.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison between diluted and adsorbed Mn atoms on Bi 2 Te 3 :</head><p>XAS and XMCD spectra of Mn adatoms on Bi 2 Te 3 in comparison with diluted Mn atoms in Bi 1.9 Mn 0.1 Te 3 are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. We found that for single Mn adatoms deposited on Bi 2 Te 3 long-range ferromagnetic order is absent. Furthermore, the magnetization curves are not saturated in a magnetic field of B = 5 T. In contrast, in case of doped Mn in Bi 1.9 Mn 0.1 Te 3 the magnetization curve can be saturated at 5T. Furthermore, our data disclose an unusual extra effect for Mn adatoms on the Bi 2 Te 3 surface, i.e. the strongest magnetic response is found in the direction pointing out of the plane. The magnitude of the XMCD relative to the XAS intensity measured for B = 5 T applied out-of-plane and close to in-plane differs by more than 40%. Moreover, a closer look at the magnetic curves of doped Mn atoms in Bi 1.9 Mn 0.1 Te 3 reveals out-of-plane anisotropy for the dopants as well, in line with previous SQUID measurements <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The dependence of the Mn dopants' magnetization on temperature confirms the transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase with the Curie temperature T C = 15 K (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). Further data analysis is needed to extrapolate quantitatively spin and angular moments of the Mn atoms in these different samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fe adatoms adsorbed on Bi 2 Se 3 :</head><p>The electronic and magnetic properties of Fe adatoms were investigated as a function of the magnetic field up to 5T as well. The measurements were performed for three different coverages, i.e. 1%, 8% and 25% of a ML that allows us to monitor how the magnetic properties of adatoms change upon the cluster density. Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> and c display Fe impurities' L 2,3 -edges of the XAS and XMCD spectra taken for the lowest and highest coverage of Fe deposited on Bi 2 Se 3 . For all coverages, we found the easy-axis in the plane. Moreover, by increasing the coverage a gradual increase of the ratio between the orbital and spin moment is observed, see Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>.
