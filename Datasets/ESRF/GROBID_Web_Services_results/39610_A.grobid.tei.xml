<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. (a): I(q, 300) of 1 and its FT (top inset). The bottom inset reports the corresponding I(q, 300) for the KMnO 4 chromofore. (b) Difference of the two I(q, 300) signals. Pump at  = 510 nm ratio, but mainly contains the modification of the radial distribution of the solvent molecules around the photodissociated complex due to local thermalization process. This is proved by the same experiment repeated for the for the KMnO 4 chromofore, that absorbs photons in the same range than 1 without undergoing any dissociation; compare the FT of the two I(q, ) curves reported in the insets of Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>. The thermal effect on the solvent can be subtracted by our signal using the blank KMnO 4 experiment, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>. This curve, much more noisy, contains only the information we are looking for. Its FT, reported as gray curve in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> left, exhibits three clear negative components at 2.2 Å (shoulder) and at 2.94 Å and 4.40 Å (well defined peaks). To understand the experimental datum, theoretical I(q) curves have been obtained from the structures optimized at DFT level for [Ru(bpy) 2 Py(H 2 O)] + and [Ru(bpy) 2 (Py) 2 ] 2+ complexes, representing our model for the photodissociated and the unperturbed complex, respectively. q-broadening due to the small non monchromaticity of the U17 undulator has been taken into account. The validity of the DFT structures has been confirmed by EXAFS experiments kindly performed in static condition by S. Nikitenko at BM26A. Successively, the theoretical I(q,  = +∞) has been calculated and its FT reported in the left part of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> as black curve. Beside the critical low R-region, the agreement between experimental and theoretical curves is remarkable for this kind of experiment. This simulation allows us to assign the three negative peaks to the dislodgement of a Py molecule: a N atom at 2.17 Å , two C atoms at 3.09 Å and other two C atoms at 4.42 Å of Py. The contribution of the last C atom around 5 Å is below the S/N ratio. The invariance of I(q, ), and thus of I(q, ), in the 300-5000 ns interval implies that the photodissociation process is completed before 300 ns, in agreement with our TD-DFT calculations.</p><p>Consequently we used the faster laser. The I(q, ) measured in the 0.1-5 ns interval (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), clearly show a signal that progressively increases with , indicating that now we are really in the time scale of the photodissociation process. Unfortunately, a first data analysis suggests that we just observed modification of the radial distribution of the solvent molecules around the photodissociated complex due to local thermalization process.
