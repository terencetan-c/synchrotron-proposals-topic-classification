<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The focus of the proposal was to analyse bioactive scaffolds that were implanted into a mouse model. Tomography and holotomography was to be used to compare the structure, tissue ingrowth, mechanical performance and failure models. An existing static compression rig at ESRF was adapted to allow in situ testing in simulated body fluid. Imaging of immersed and wet samples proved to be problematic due to the photo-chemical cracking of water, produced bubbles which shifted the samples during scanning as a worse case, and in the best case significantly changed the background. Imaging of dry samples was very successful with the resolution providing excellent contrast such that hard and soft tissue, as well as the scaffold material, could all be differentiated. In addition calcium distribution was detectable within the porous glass scaffold and lacunae could be detected within the mouse bone. This imaging was combined with compression testing very successfully. Although holotomography was carried out, the analysis of these scans was not successful due to problems in the reconstruction algorithms. In summary, many portions of the proposal were highly successful, but challenges were met with regards to holotomography and wet imaging. Due to these limitations, a portion of the final day was used on samples ranging from titanium scaffolds to imaging of intermetallics in aluminium alloys. These scans were also highly successful and novel. To date, the work has yielded 7 publications, several of these proving to be very important, as listed below.</p></div>

Vascular corrosion casting is used to create a stable replica of the vascular network and X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT) to obtain the 3D images. In-house computer-aided image analysis techniques were then used to perform a quantitative morphological analysis of the images.</p><p>Results: With the use of these methods, differences in the numbers of vessel segments, their diameter, and volume of vessels in the vitreous compartment were quantitated in wild-type neonatal mice or littermates over-expressing a labile (nonheparin binding) isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 120 ) from the developing lens. This methodology was instructive in demonstrating that hyaloid vascular networks in VEGFA 120 over-expressing mice have a 10-fold increase in blind-ended, a six-fold increase in connected vessel segments, in addition to a sixfold increase (0.0314 versus 0.0051 mm 3 ) in total vitreous vessel volume compared with wild type. These parameters are not readily quantified via histological, ultrastructural, or stereological analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The combination of techniques described here provides the first 3D quantitative characterization of vasculature in an organ system; i.e., the neonatal murine intra-ocular vasculature in both wild-type mice and a transgenic model of lens-specific over-expression of VEGF. The presence of pores and intermetallics can often limit the fatigue performance of cast aluminum alloy components. However, predicting the size distribution of these microstructural features is difficult due to the stochastic nature of their nucleation, complex thermodynamics/kinetics, and their interactions with other phases during growth. This paper will investigate how in situ X-ray observations (using synchrotron and lab sources) can be combined with three dimensional microstructural models to predict the size, morphology and distribution of the Fe-rich intermetallic phases (e.g. α-Al 8 Fe 2 Si and β-Al 5 FeSi) and pores which form during the solidification of Al-Si-Cu-Fe alloys.</p><p>The kinetics of Fe-rich intermetallic formation is unknown due to the highly non-equilibrium nature of this process which makes it difficult to determine the local undercooling using normal quenching techniques. Because of their fine faceted shapes, direct measurements of their kinetics are only possible when high resolution imaging (e.g. 1 μm/pixels) is adopted. In-situ observation using synchrotron X-ray radiography allows both Fe-rich intermetallic and pore nucleation and growth kinetics to be quantified as a function of temperature. Using this experimental data, we developed a kinetic-thermodynamic model, solving both multicomponent diffusion equations and total free energy. Crystallographic anisotropies of monoclinic β-Al 5 FeSi are accounted for by an adapted implementation of combined Monte-Carlo and geometric constraint techniques. The resulting simulations predict that increasing the Fe content causes the Fe-rich intermetallics to form large needles/plates, in agreement with synchrotron tomography results. Increasing Fe content has a non-linear effect on pore formation, first increasing and then decreasing the pore size. This non-linear effect is hypothesized to be caused by the interaction of competing influences on pore nucleation and growth rates. Fe-rich intermetallic phases (e.g. β-Al 5 FeSi), which form during the solidification of Al-Si-Cu-Fe alloys, can have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of cast components. A thermodynamic database was combined with a numerical solution of multi-component diffusion to predict the formation of both this secondary phase and the primary phases. The growth kinetics and morphology was simulated using a combined Monte-Carlo algorithm to calculate the transformation frequency for each cell as a function of total free energy, with the faceted shapes replicated via a decentred needle/plate algorithm. The non-stoichiometric composition of both Fe and Si was simulated by changing the partition coefficient at the solid/liquid interface according to local kinetic parameters such as growth velocity and effective diffusion. The model predicted phase fraction, size and morphology of Fe-rich intermetallic phases in type-319 alloys (Al-7.5wt.%Si-3.5wt.%Cu-0.2~0.8wt.%Fe) compared well to high resolution synchrotron tomography observations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>6.</head><figDesc>Lee, PD, Wang, J, Li, M, "Coupling In-situ Observations and Microscale Modeling to Predict Pore and Fe-rich Intermetallic Formation during the Solidification of Al-Si-Cu-Fe Alloys", Modeling of Casting, Welding and Advanced Solidification Processes -XII, Vancouver, June 2009, p87.
