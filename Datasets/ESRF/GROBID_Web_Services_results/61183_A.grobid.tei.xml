<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our continued search for polymers having apparently irreconciliable properies such as high level of crystallinity and/or high glass transition temperature coupled with elastomeric properties, such as crystalline block copolymers, our studies have recently focused on isotactic 1,2-poly((E)-3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene) (iPE3MPD), a new polymer showing interesting elastomeric properties in spite of a glass transition temperature of 30 °C. iPE3MPD has been recently synthesized with a new class of catalysts, 1 based on cobalt phosphine complexes. The deformation mechanism at the origing of the elastomeric properties of iPE3MPD is here investigated by time-deformation resolved simultaneous SAXS/WAXS synchrotron measurements. Measurement were performed at Dutch-Belgian beam line BM26-Dubble of ESRF (Grenoble, France). The wavelength of incident X-rays was λ = 0.10402 nm and the sample to detector distance was 0.27 m for WAXS and 4.58 m for SAXS measurements. The covered range for the scattering vector q was 6-30 nm -1 for WAXS and 0.6-1.8 nm -1 for WAXS data, where q is equal to q =4π sinθ /λ, and 2θ is the scattering angle. Stripes of initial gauge length 15 mm, and width of 5 mm, have been cut from a compression molded film having thickness of 0.41 mm, and mounted in a Linkam tensile stage TST350. Sample jaws move in opposite directions and scattering data have been collected in transmission, using a highly collimated incident beam hitting the sample at the center of the gauge length with a size of 200μm  200μm. Scattering data have been collected at a rate of 1 frame/2 s, while deforming the sample at a rate of 10 mm/min. Two consecutive deformation step cycles have been performed, consisting in stretching the sample up to ≈150% strain (Path 1), and then releasing the tension up to measure force zero, in the first step, and then stretching again the sample up to ≈210% strain (Path 2) and then releasing the tension up to measure force zero in the second step. The scattered intensities I(q) have then been subtracted for the empty Linkam cell and processed with the program FIT2D 2,3 and Bubble 3 to extract meridional and equatorial profiles, in angular sectors covering a range of 30° around the horizontal (equator) and vertical (meridian) axis for the SAXS patterns and equatorial sections covering a angular sector of 20° around the horizontal (equator) for the WAXS patterns. The bi-dimensional SAXS and WAXS patterns recorded in situ during stretching are reported in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, along with the stress-strain curves (Figure <ref type="figure">1K</ref>). The sample is first stretched up to ≈150% deformation (A-F, A'-F', Path 1 of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The corresponding stress strain curve (Path 1 of Figure <ref type="figure">1K</ref>) shows a well pronounced yielding as a consequence of aging. Then the tension is released up to reach null force. The sample recovers only minimally the initial dimensions, achieving a deformation of ≈120% (Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>,<ref type="figure">G'</ref>). Successively, the sample is stretched again from ≈120% strain up to ≈ 210% deformation (Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>-J, G'-J', Path 2) and also in this case the tension is gradually released (Figure <ref type="figure">1J</ref>,<ref type="figure">J'</ref>) up to measure a null force. At variance with the Path 1, after 10 minutes at the end of the path 2, the sample recovers almost completely the initial deformation of 120% st the end of path 1, and succevive hysteresis cycles after 2 become practically coincident.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. SAXS (A-J) and WAXS (A'-J') collected during two consecutive step cycles of deformation (deformation rate of 10 mm/min) (K) consisting in a first stretching step up to ≈150 % deformation (A-F, A'-F', Path 1) and successive release of the tension up to measure null force, and in second stretching step from 123% deformation e up to ≈210% deformation (G-J, G'-J', Path 2).</head><p>The WAXS patterns of Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>'-J' reveal in more detail the change in intensity for the two halos on the equator, centered at q ≈7 and 13 nm -1 (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In particular, it is apparent that with increase of deformation, whereas the relative intensity of the first halo increases and tends to become polarized on the equator, the intensity of the second halo tends to decrease (Figure <ref type="figure">1A'-F'</ref> and <ref type="figure">G'-J</ref>' and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Moreover, the halo at q≈13 nm -1 disappears almost completely at the maximum deformation achieved in Path 1 and 2 (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>', J' and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Upon release of the tension the intensity distribution of the halo at q≈7 nm -1 becomes more isotropic, whereas the relative intensity of the halo at q≈13 nm -1 increases (Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>' and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Ex-situ measurements reveal that, upon stretching, the reflection at q≈13 nm -1 becomes polarized on a well defined layer line, corresponding to a periodicity of ≈ 8 nm parallel to the stretching direction, and this layer line reflection disppear releasing the tension. This indicates that the crystallization of mesomorphic domains induced by stretching is reversible in consecutive step cycles of deformation and release of the tension. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> A-J, reversible changes occur also at SAXS length scale. In fact, by effect of stretching, the SAXS intensity tends to become polarized on the equator (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>,I), and upon release of the tension, the intensity distribution becomes more isotropic (Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>). The polarization of intensity achieved at maximum deformation of ≈150% deformation in the Path 1 (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>), and ≈210% deformation in Path 2 (Figure <ref type="figure">1I</ref>), may be also evidenced by comparing the SAXS profiles on the equator and the meridian, at 0, 151 and 211% deformation in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>. It is apparent that whereas the equatorial and meridional profiles are coincident for the undeformed sample, at 150 and 211% deformation the intensity on the equator becomes almost one order magnitude higher than the intensity on the meridian. This is the hallmark that, upon stretching, elongated domains with electron density higher than the surrounding matrix are formed, oriented with the long axis in the stretching direction. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>A B 10 15 20 Relaxing % % % % % % % % Equatorial WAXS profiles q (nm -1 ) = 0% Immediately after release of the tension Stretching-Path 1 Stretching-Path 2 0.1 1 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 = 0% Meridian = 0% Equator = 151% Meridian-Path 1 = 151% Equator-Path 1 = 211% Meridian-Path 2 = 211% Equator-Path 2 SAXS intensity q (nm -1 ) I  q -4 Figure 1. These preliminary results indicate that the unusual elastomeric properties of iPE3MPD are associated with the stress-induced crystallization of the amorphous phase into a metastable mesophase. Upon release of the tension, the mesomorphic domains "melt" and the sample recovers the initial dimensions. The role of the mesomorphic domains is of providing physical knots of the elastomeric network, preventing the viscous flow of the chains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
