<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We studied systematically the solubility and speciation of Re in fluids as a function of pressure, temperature (P/T), and fluid composition (sulfur, chlorine, fO2) using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD). Such information can only be obtained through in-situ synchrotron radiation experiments at high P/T conditions. We covered the range of P/T conditions that correspond to Re mobilization during hydrothermal and magmatic processes (0.08-0.5 GPa, and 300 -400 °C) using optimized devices such as the hydrothermal autoclave and the resistively heated diamond anvil cell. We have conducted two key experimental sessions at FAME-UHD and BM23.</p><p>At FAME-UHD 12 high P/T runs were conducted in the autoclave up to 400°C and 800 bars and in HERFD-XAS mode and on the Re L3 edge (10.535 keV -emission at 8.6525 keV). The X-ray emission spectrometer was equipped with six silicon (642) crystal analyzers and energy resolved Ketek fluorescence detector. Tungsten L3 edge spectra (10.207 keV) were acquired throughout the experiment in transmission mode to verify the monochromator angle to energy calibration. We tested first the signal quality using Re standard solution obtained from the dissolution of NaReO₄ in distilled water, Re concentrations ranging from 9.6 to 5000 ppm. These solutions were prepared by Harald Mueller (ESRF Chemistry Laboratory). Best signal quality and no precipitation in the beam were observed for the solutions with intermediate concentrations ranging from 2500 -3333 ppm of Re. With the current beamline and detection settings 9.6 ppm of Re could still be well resolved both with HERFD and transmission XAS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The HERFD data suggest that potentially even lower concentrations are detectable. Subsequently Re speciation experiments were conducted using pure water, HCl solutions with concentrations of 0.1, 1.7, and 5 M, a 1.7 M NaCl solution, a 0.135 mol/L Na2S solution, and a mixture consisting of a 0.135 mol/L Na2S and + 0.144 mol/L NaOH solution (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). We used the Re standard solutions to calibrate the XRF counts to concentrations for the solubility experiments and performed one solubility experiment of ReS2 in 2.66 mol/L Na2S 2.66 mol/L NaOH. The first analysis of the data reveals high thermal stability of the [Re VII O] -4 complex in neutral solutions including water, 1.7 M NaCl, low concentrated HCl solutions (0.1 M), and oxygen-rich solutions such as 0.135 mol/L Na2S and + 0.144 mol/L NaOH. At higher chlorine concentrations and acid solutions (&gt;1.7 M HCl) the thermal stability of [ReO] -4 complexes reduces to 100 °C (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Beyond 100 °C the white line of the HERFD-XANES spectra shifts to lower energy and changes the shape, indicating changes in the oxidation state of Re and dominant complex composition. We expect that at these conditions either oxochloro complexes of Re form similar to observations on molybdenum in acid solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Borg et al., 2012]</ref> or pure chlorine complexes form as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Xiong &amp; Wood [2002]</ref>. Careful analysis of both HERFD-XANES and EXAFS observations is currently in progress to resolve the speciation of Re above 200°C. The HERFD-XANES spectrum of Re in 0.135 mol/L Na2S solution also shows strong changes if compared with [Re VII O] -4 complex. Under these conditions, Re complexes with S are expected to predominate. The reference compounds analyzed include Re metal, Re [VI] O2, Re [VII] O3, NaRe [VII] O4, and Re [VII] S2 (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</p><p>The dissolution experiment on ReS2 in sulfur-bearing solution revealed an unexpectedly high solubility of Re at 400 °C and 800 bars. Further solubility experiments of Re, ReO2, and ReS2 are required to constrain its transport and enrichment in natural ore-forming fluids. These additional experiments are required to complement our pioneer measurements at FAME-UHD. We, therefore, plan to submit another proposal to finalize this dataset. At BM23 we tested first the detection limits of Re in the diamond anvil cell using a SDD Vortex detector for X-ray fluorescence detection combined with a polycapillary optics similar to our previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Farsang et al., 2021)</ref>. For this purpose, several standard solutions prepared by dissolving NaReO₄ in distilled water were loaded in steel gaskets and sealed under very low pressure &lt;0.1 GPa. The calibration results, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, are very promising and reveal that concentration down to the ppm level can be detected inside the diamond anvil cell and polycapillary optics at BM23 after the EBS. Subsequently, we tested the solubility of pure Re metal in 0.1 M HCl solution loaded in a Re gasket lined with platinum. We did not detect any dissolution of Re up to 400 °C (steps of 50 °C) and 1 GPa suggesting a very low solubility of Re (below 10 ppm) at these conditions even after 1 day of heating. In the available beamtime the beamline alignment, calibration, and this first dissolution experiment could be performed, which provide very promising results to further study of Re solubility. We, therefore, plan to submit also an additional proposal to BM23 to detect Re solubility at higher P/T conditions not easily achievable using the autoclave system. According to our observations at BM16, the Re solubility in S-bearing solutions would be important to verify under T-P which can be reached with a diamond anvil cell. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
