<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SC-5186 was performed on the microbranch of ID13 with beamsize of (2x2) µm 2 -(10x10) µm 2 at energy of 13keV with expusre time 20 ms per point. The aim of the project was to study the effect of enviromental hydration on the structural features and the distribution of metal ions in biofilms at different time points of biofilm formation. In SC-5186 we corroborated the contribution of spores to the XRD fingerprint of WT biofilms, and measured the effect of humidity on isolated spores. In addition, we compated the XRD fingetprint of biofilms mutants as a functionof biofilm age. Finally, we maped the distripution of metal ions on WT and mutant biofilms both on top view (2D) orientation and cross-sections (3D).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>In this beamtime we performed control experiments to better support our previous findings as well as performed additional experiments to ellaborate on our previous results.</p><p>1. we measured the XRD from two important controls: isolated spores and a mutant that cannot form spores (∆𝑆𝑖𝑔𝐹), and showed that the WT doublet originate from spores in the biofilms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). We also discovered that hydrating isolated spored lead to a shift in the doublet peaks toward lower q values (larger d spacing), indicating structural changes in the spores due to water absorbtion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). 2. We evaluated the effect of time (biofilm age) on XRD signals of WT and matrix mutants: ∆𝐸𝑃𝑆 (lack of polysacchride) and ∆𝑇𝑎𝑠𝐴 (lack of major protein). In WT biofilms, the doublet peak (attributed to spores) appeares only after 48 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref>), corroborating our previosly published results. Interestingly, in the lack of the polysaccharide EPS, matrix signal (at ~6 nm -1 and 14 nm -1 ) is detained and only appears at 24h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>); The lack of the protein TasA seems to be leff substantial to the matrix XRD signature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>). 3. We measured XRF signals from cross sections of young (24 h) and old (72 h) WT biofilms and observed a gradient in the signal of metal ions (e.g., Ca and Mn) from bottom to the top of the young biofilm; These gradients were less dominant in older (72h) biofilms (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). We also show here 1D XRD profiles of cross sections. The thickness of these cross sections will need to optimized in the next beamtime.  A B Figure 3. XRD and XRF signals measured from cross-sections of WT biofilm at 24 h and 72 h. (A) XRD signals of WT24 (CS) in red and WT72 (CS) in black salt peaks overlapped with biofilm signal. (B) XRF maps of Ca, Mn, and Zn. A concentration gradient of Ca and Mn is observed from bottom to top of young biofilms (24 h), while Zn is homogenous across the biofilm cross-section. This gradient is less clear in cross sections of mature (72 h) biofilms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2. XRD signals from WT biofilm (A), ∆EPS mutant (B), and ∆TasA mutant (C) at different ages: 12 h (black), 24 h (red), 48 h (blue) and 72 h (green). Data shows that doublet peak at ~ 6.2,6.6nm -1 is observed only for WT samples and only for old biofilms (48 h and 72 h). The spore-attributed doublet disappears in both ∆TasA and ∆EPS mutants but only EPS affects matrix formation at early time points (12h).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.96,428.64,533.04,156.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
