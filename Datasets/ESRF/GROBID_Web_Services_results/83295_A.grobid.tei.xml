<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The goal of the experiments was to measure the densities at lunar relevant P-T conditions of two hydrous primitive end-member lunar melts, namely the low-Ti Apollo 15C green glass and the high-Ti Apollo 14B black glass. During the allocated beamtime, experiments were performed using x-ray diffraction techniques previously developed for the Paris-Edinburgh press at ESRF <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The assembly consisted of a boron epoxy gasket, a cylindrical graphite furnace and a diamond capsule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Diamond capsules (Ø in = 0.5 mm, Ø out = 1.5 mm and height = 1.0 mm) were used because of their incompressibility, high melting point, lack of reaction with the sample and because of its X-ray transparency. The synthetic equivalents of low-Ti Apollo 15C green glass and Apollo 14B black glass, both containing the appropiate amounts of brucite or Mg(OH) 2 to generate 4 wt.% H 2 O upon melting, were packed in the diamond capsules. These mixtures were also doped with 500 ppm Cs to measure potential H 2 O loss after the experiment, using the initial and post-experimental H/Cs ratios. Starting mixtures were analyzed with EPMA prior to density measurements and were observed to closely resemble the desired compositions. To prevent H 2 O loss during the experiments, Pt end caps were used on both sides. These end caps both act as effective seals to prevent volatile loss and are efficient pressure transfer media during pressurization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Capsules were enclosed in a hBN cylinder and hBN caps were placed on both ends. The furnace assembly was then fitted into a 7mm boron gasket. A ~50-100 m diameter hole was drilled in the side of the BN sleeve surrounding the diamond capsule, which was filled with pressure markers hBN and Pt powders. These powders are required to determine the P-T conditions within the assembly using the equations of state of hBN and Pt. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Observation and results</head><p>A total of 10 cell assemblies were prepared and loaded in the Paris-Edinburgh press at ID27. Five experiments were performed for each composition (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) at different P-T conditions. At the desired peak oil pressure, experiments were rapidly heated (100-200 K/min) to minimize diffusion of H out of the sample. Diffraction spectra were collected until there were no signs of crystals remaining, i.e. the sample was completely molten (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). In some cases the power used directly resulted in complete melting of the sample; power was then gradually decreased to pin-point the liquidus T using the technique outlined above (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This does not only yield multiple density measurements for the same sample at different T, but are also the first in-situ liquidus curves of hydrous lunar low-and high-Ti melts. Preliminary comparisons with anhydrous data for the same compositions and identical P-T conditions suggests that the liquidus T of both lunar melts with 4 wt.% H 2 O are &gt;150-200 K lower. After collection of the diffraction spectra, samples were rapidly quenched and additional measurements were obtained at room P by rotating the assembly upside-down by 180 degrees. Several run products showed clear evidence absence of quench crystals, which is very promising given the fact that it will significantly decrease errors on subsequent fitting of absorption spectra to obtain densities. Initial fitting of the hBN-Pt calibrations yielded P-T conditions that compared well with previous calibrations <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p>Data analysis is still in progress. Chemical run products will be analyzed in the next months using an EPMA to quantify possible H 2 O losses. These H 2 O contents will be used to compare the melt densities obtained from absorption spectra fitting with density data from their anhydrous counterparts for a given pressure [2]. Our preliminary results show that 1) H 2 O was retained during the experiments, given the much lower melting points of the hydrous compositions relative to their anhydrous counterparts; 2) most lunar melts quenched to a crystal-poor glass, which is expected to result in very accurate density measurements; 3) melting points of hydrous low-Ti and high-Ti lunar glasses are at least 150-200 K lower than their anhydrous counterparts. To summarize, we showed in experiment ES/578 that we can realibly obtain densities and liquidus relationships of hydrous lunar melts, and that significant H 2 O losses did not occur. We therefore showed that this set-up is also suitable for in-situ determination of viscosities of hydrous lunar melts. Precise experimental determination of the density, viscosity and melting points of hydrous lunar melts and constraining the dependence of these variables on P-T and composition of the silicate melt is absolute key for modelling the generation and evolution of primitive lunar melts and or understanding the early evolution of the Moon. With further experiments, we aim to provide the first full in situ data set on both the density and viscosity of primitive hydrous lunar magma as a function of P-T.
