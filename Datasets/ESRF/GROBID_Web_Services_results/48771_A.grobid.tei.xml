<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proposal was aimed to understand the chemistry and electrochemistry of photoelectrons created at solid/liquid interface under X-ray illumination. The idea of combining electrochemistry with X-ray photolithography and involving photoelectrons to electrochemical circuit was originated from experimental observation of the variation in electrochemical deposition/etching rates at the working electrode under illumination. Generally, absorption of a high-energy photon by the electrode surface leads to numerous secondary events with an avalanche-type creation of low-energy excited electrons. In cases the energy of the electron exceeds the Volta potential difference, it can escape from the surface to the electrolyte volume. In case of cathodic polarization low-energy electrons emitted from the electrode surface can further reduce cations in the Helmholtz layer, while high-energy electrons get through the electric double layer to electrolyte volume (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Thus, emitted photoelectrons generally produce an additional electric current at the electrode-electrolyte interface that involves electrochemical transformation. Unlike the radiolysis products, these electrons have no oxidizing pairs, which obviously shifts electrochemical equilibrium and enhances deposition rates on the illuminated areas of the electrode. The holes on core levels generated by Xrays move away from the electrode surface under applied potential and annihilate effectively in the electrode volume. The circuit completes through electrochemical reactions on the anode. In frames of CH-3523 experiment several tasks were adressed: 1) Cyclic voltammetry of Ni and Pd deposition/etching in corresponding electrolyte solutions at different Xray intensities and energies.</p><p>2) Potentiostatic X-ray assisted deposition/etching of Ni and Pd at different X-ray energies.</p><p>3) X-ray elecrochemical lithography experiments through Ni deposition in potentiostatic regimes using Talbot imaging of 4.2 μm grating and ultimate resolution determination using silicon multilens interferometer.</p><p>All the experiments were performed on Pt and Cu microelectrodes with diameter of ~500 μm. Sets of CRL lenses were used to adjust illuminated area to fit the size of microelecrodes and homogeneously illuminate it. The experiments on cyclic voltammetry reveled a substantial current increase for both anodic and cathodic polarisation under X-ray illunination. One should note, while an increase in cathodic current is well understood in frames of proposed photoelectron current model, an increase of current for anodic polarisation needs further interpretation. Current transients recorded during potentiostatic deposition of Ni under periodic illumination of an electrode by X-rays revealed an extensive increase in current on switching X-ray illumination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The effect of Xrays is observed even under an open circuit conditions, resulting in a slow metal deposition that is pronounced only in long-term experiments (&gt;10 h). The photocurrent increased significantly (10-100 times) then applying cathodic polarization. An increase in photocurrent with an applied potential suggests the lowenergy secondary electrons to govern the process of X-ray assisted electrochemical deposition. Photocurrent yield measured for different X-ray energies varies form ~1000 electrons ejected into the electrolyte volume per one absorbed photon at 24 keV to ~15000 at 96 keV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). This dependence is obviously indicative for multiple secondary processes and thermalization of photoelectrons. Unfortunatelly we fail to observe a reasonable photoelectron current increase while shifting excitation energy over Pd X-ray absorption edge (in the Pd electrodeposition experiments). To testify the possibility of electrochemical X-ray photolithography and determine an ultimate resolution for the method, Talbot imaging of the diffraction phase grating and multilens CRL interferometer were performed. In the first case the grating to sample distance was adjisted to provide maximal contrast at minimal feature size. The use of multilens interferometer enabled us to control interline spacing, hovewer achived B/W contrast (~1:3) was not enouth to improve the resolution. The resulting structures iillustrated an ultumate B/W resolution of the method below 360 nm governed probably by lifetime of radiolysis products, spur radii and electron inelastic mean free paths in condensed matter. Further increase of resolution can be possible through minimising X-rays energy (to minimize electron IMFP) and improvement of B/W contrast by X-ray optics. The results of of CH-3523 experiment were partly used for the prearation of manuscript <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
