<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>has a strong activity on hydrogen storage materials, involving many national and international collaborators. The strong position of the group is to a high degree owing to the good access to neutrons for powder neutron diffraction (PND) using the diffractometer PUS at the Institute's research reactor JEEP II.</p><p>Synchrotron power X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) is an invaluable supplement to PND due to the superior speed and resolution. The data acquisition times are typically 3 orders of magnitude shorter using the MAR345 image plate at BM01A compared to PUS at JEEP II. This allows in-situ investigations of chemical reactions that we cannot possibly follow with PND. The very high resolution offered at BM01B enables indexing and space group determination from complex structures where the problem with peak overlapping makes the task unmanageable with PND-or laboratory PXD data.</p><p>Thus, the predictable, long-term access to the beam lines at SNBL through the longterm projects 01-01-805 and 01-02-862, has been an invaluable supplement to our neutron diffraction facilities and the rest of our experimental activity. This final report summarizes the obtained results for the long-term project 01-01-805.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One such intermediate phase was first identified in the previous long-term project and preliminary suggested to be a new modification of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 , tentatively named " -Ca(BH 4 ) 2 " (see final report for previous long-term project 01-02-772). A sample of this phase in almost pure form was produced in our home laboratory by using a procedure with repeated heating cycles. The sample was measured with the MAR345 image plate detector at BM01A and with HR-SR PXD at BM01B. The data could be indexed in an orthorhombic cell with unit cell parameters a = 8.995 Å, b = 8.052 Å and c = 11.767 Å. The structure was solved in space group Cmc2 1 and identified as Ca 3 (BD 4 ) 3 (BO 3 ). The Rietveld refinement fit and reflection profiles are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, and the structure is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The stability of the structure at ambient conditions is confirmed by DFT calculations, and the co-existence of BD 4 and BO 3 complexes are confirmed by IR spectroscopy.</p><p>Ca 3 (BD 4 ) 3 (BO 3 ) is the first example of a product from a borohydride oxidation containing both B-H and B-O bonds. It thus represents a novel category of compounds completely different from the hydroxoborate products that form upon borohydride hydrolysis. The result represents an important contribution to fundamental boron chemistry and could provide insight to the reaction mechanisms encountered during borohydride oxidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The results have been published in Journal of Materials Chemistry</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The crystal structure of alpha-and beta-Y(BD 4 ) 3</head><p>The solvent adducts of rare-earth metal borohydrides have attracted considerable interest in recent years because of their highly selective catalytic activities towards certain organic reactions. Very little is known about the unsolvated rare-earth borohydrides, however, with respect to structure, catalytic activity and especially their potential use as solid state hydrogen storage materials.</p><p>The mechanochemical reaction between LiBD 4 and YCl 3 in ratios of 3:1 and 4:1 led to the formation of Y(BD 4 ) 3 in the form of several polymorphs. The structure of -Y(BD 4 ) 3 was re-determined from doubly substituted ( 11 B, D) samples using PND data. Post annealing of the as-prepared material under deuterium resulted in a phase transformation at temperatures above 180 o C into -Y(BD 4 ) 3 . High-resolution SR-PXD data of a post-annealed sample were collected at BM01B and used for indexing and space group determination (a=11.0086(1) Å; space group Fm-3c). The data were used in conjunction with PND data obtained from the PUS diffractometer at the JEEP II reactor (Kjeller, Norway) for ab-initio structure determination using the global optimization approach. The structure model was refinement according to the Rietveld method (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>(a) (b) The structure of -Y(BD 4 ) 3 consists of Y 3+ cations that are octahedrally surrounded by six [BD 4 ] -anions. The local coordination scheme can be identified as [12D+6B]. It is obtained via twelve Y-D contacts through the edges of each BD 4 tetrahedron (Figure 4a) as well as six Y-B contacts in the form of an ideal and undistorted Y-B-octahedron (Figure 4b). The results have been published in Journal of Alloys and Compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The crystal structure of LiCe(BD 4 ) 3 Cl</head><p>The mechanochemical reaction between LiBH 4 and CeCl 3 in a molar ratio of (3:1) has been reported to lead to the formation of the lanthanide borohydride Ce(BH 4 ) 3 . Our results obtained under identical experimental conditions indicate the formation of the first mixed-metal, mixed-anion lanthanide borohydride, LiCe(BH 4 ) 3 Cl, instead.</p><p>The doubly-substituted ( 11 B, D) material was measured by high-resolution SR-PXD (BM01B) and PND (PUS, JEEP II). A structure model in the cubic space group I-43m (a= 11.59159(16) Å) was later used for a combined Rietveld refinement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).  The crystal structure and unit cell contents for LiCe(BD 4 ) 3 Cl are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. The structure can be envisioned as being composed of Ce 4 -Cl 4 subunits forming a distorted hetero-cube. Each cerium atom is furthermore coordinated to 3 [BD 4 ] groups resulting in an octahedral environment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>). The overall coordination scheme around the central cerium cation can be described as [9D+3Cl] with Ce-D contacts being realized through tetrahedral faces of each [BD 4 ] - anion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). The two crystallographically independent Li ions possess completely different coordination schemes: Li1 has a similar environment to that found in the orthorhombic phase of LiBH 4 and is tetrahedrally surrounded by 4 [BD 4 ] groups. There exist 12 Li-D contacts that are realized through coordination of tetrahedral faces of each [BD 4 ] tetrahedron to the Lithium cation. 4 of these Li-D contacts are short and around 1.91 Å in length, whereas the remaining 8 contacts are much longer and about 2.67 Å (Figure 6). The second Lithium atom, Li2, occupies the central position inside the Ce-Cl heterocube subunit and is tetrahedrally surrounded by four Ce atoms and 4 Cl atoms with short Li-Cl bond distances of 2.193(5) Å and Ce-Cl bond distance of about 2.964(3) Å (Figures 6 and 8).</p><p>The results have been published in J. Phys. Chem C <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mechano-chemical reaction between LiBH 4 and YbCl 3</head><p>Ball-milling is a feasible alternative to wet-chemical methods in order to synthesize borohydrides, since it allows preparation of these materials without the need for additional solvents. This eliminates the existence of intermediate solvent-adducts that have to undergo heat-treatment in order to obtain the solvent-free materials.</p><p>The mechano-chemical reaction between LiBH 4 and YbCl 3 in a molar ratio of (3:1) was found to proceed without gas evolution, which indicated that ytterbium was kept in its original trivalent state, and that the reaction was conducted without decomposition of the starting materials. HR-SR-PXD (BM01B) and PND (PUS; JEEP II) data were collected on hydride and deuteride samples. The as-milled material possessed very broad peaks and could be indexed in a cubic unit cell with a = 6.2008(8) Å in space group P23. Post-annealing under hydrogen/deuterium led to new materials/phases for temperatures above 100 o C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> shows the SR-PXD and PND patterns for a sample annealed at 160 o C / 30 bar deuterium: The HR-SR-PXD data was used for indexing and space group assignment. Based on 19 reflections in the Q-range 1.25 -6, a tetragonal unit cell with lattice parameters a = 6.74552(12) Å and c = 4.28216(8) Å was identified as a possible solution. Based on reflection conditions, P4 2 /nnm was then selected as the most probable space group. Interestingly, a LeBail intensity extraction performed on the PND data in this space group setting (and possible subgroups) showed the existence of several peaks that were not allowed, most prominently the first intensive peak in the PND data. This would indicate that either a) the unit cell is larger than seen by PXD, e.g. a lattice constant needs to be doubled, or b) the crystal symmetry is only pseudo-tetragonal and that in fact the system needs to be described in an orthorhombic or even lower symmetry due to different sublattice ordering of the weakly contributing BD 4 scatterers compared to the heavy atom ytterbium. Since the appearance of the PXD data is dominated by ytterbium, it appears that the true symmetry can only be obtained from a combination of SR-PXD -PND data sets.</p><p>This system is currently under investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mechano-chemical reaction between NaBH 4 and YCl 3</head><p>Ball-milling and cryo-milling experiments with mixtures of LiBH 4 / NaBH 4 and YCl 3 (4:1) were performed aiming at the synthesis of the mixed-metal borohydride Li/NaY(BH 4 ) 4 . In the case of LiBH 4 as a borohydride source, the formation of Y(BH 4 ) 3 was observed instead. The use of NaBH 4 , however, led neither to the formation of Y(BH 4 ) 3 nor to NaY(BH 4 ) 4 as a final product. In-situ SR-PXD experiments performed at BM01A (see report for long-term project 01-02-862) on as-milled materials indicated the formation of several crystalline phases during heat treatment in the solid state, followed by thermal decomposition at temperatures above 350 o C. Several attempts were undertaken to generate these crystalline phases ex-situ and to characterize them by powder diffraction. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref> shows the HR-SR-PXD pattern of a post-annealed sample that was obtained by heating the as-milled material at a temperature of 225 o C under 30 bar of hydrogen for 24 hours. Three phases could be identified from the HR-SR-PXD data: NaCl (a=5.63 Å, space group Fm-3m), NaBH 4 (a = 6.07 Å, space group Fm-3m), and a Na 3 YCl 6 -type phase (a = 7.06 Å, c= 19.1 Å, space group R-3), albeit with enlarged lattice constants compared to the published structure in the ICSD database (database-entry 300258: a= 6.973(1) Å, c = 18.684(1) Å). This could indicate that Cl-BH 4 anion substitution has occurred in the sample. Assuming that the remaining peaks belonged to a single phase, they were indexed on basis of an orthorhombic unit cell (a = 8.1218(2) Å, b = 6.5964(2) Å, c = 6.7565(2) Å).</p><p>Reflection conditions were found to be in agreement with space groups Pmm2/Pmmm.</p><p>Ravnsbaek et al. have recently demonstrated in an independent study that this phase is in fact a rare example of a mixed-metal, mixed-anion borohydride, namely NaY(BH 4 ) 2 Cl 2 .</p><p>The results will be included in a planned publication on transition metal-and rare earth-borohydrides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substitution of hydrogen by fluoride in AlD 3</head><p>AlD 3 , alane, is regarded as an interesting material for hydrogen storage due to its high gravimetric hydrogen content (10.8 wt%). In this study, fluorides were added to the synthesis of alane to investigate a possible substitution by the formation of a mixed solid solution phase like AlD (3-x) F x . Such anion substitution could change the stability and thermodynamics of alane.</p><p>Alane was made by cryomilling a mixture of 3LiAlD 4 + AlCl 3 → 4AlD 3 + 3LiCl. In two samples, either AlF 3 or NaF were added to the starting materials in a molar ratio 1:1 of D and F in the sample. In a third sample (sample 3) AlD 3 was premade by the above mentioned reaction and AlF 3 was added after the synthesis to see possible changes from the sample preparation conditions. The samples were cryomilled for 1 h in a Spex Freezer mill. High resolution PXD data was collected at SNBL station B. The samples were measured after 4 months of storage.  Mg(BH 4 ) 2 was ball milled with MgI 2 in a 1:1 molar ratio to possibly partly substitute the BH 4 ‾unit of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 by I ‾ and make a mixed phase Mg(BH 4 ) 2-x I x. The mixture was hand-ground for 10 min or ball milled for 30 min, 1h, 2h and 12h at 280 or 500 rpm to see possible substitution. High resolution SR-PXD data of the samples was collected at beamline BM01B, and the data currently awaits analysis.. The work is still in progress..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase transformations in chlorine-substituted NaBH 4</head><p>Samples of Na(BH 4 ) 1-x Cl x with any value of x can be prepared by ball milling of NaBH 4 and NaCl in the proper ratio. Pure NaBH 4 is reported to have a phase transition at 190 K. Simultaneous SR-PXD and Raman measurements of NaBH 4 were performed at BM01B at ambient temperature and 110 K. Both data methods confirm that a phase transformation has taken place (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref>).</p><p>6 8</p><p>Int.</p><p>2 / deg.   The structure and phase transition will be further investigated by powder neutron diffraction at IFE, where temperatures down to 9 K can be reached, and the results will be published later in 2012.</p><p>The crystal structure of Ca(AlD 4 ) 2</p><p>Solvent-free Ca(AlD 4 ) 2 was synthesized by ball milling of CaD 2 and AlD 3 in a molar ratio of 1:2. The crystal structure of Ca(AlD 4 ) 2 had been predicted by computational methods to take the orthorhombic Ca(BF 4 ) 2 -type structure. However, this had not been experimentally verified.</p><p>SR-PXD data collected at BM01B and PND data collected at the PUS instrument at IFE (Kjeller, Norway) where used in a simultaneous Rietveld refinement of the crystal structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref>). The refinements confirm the predicted structure. The results have been published in Journal of Alloys and Compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> Hydride formation in Mg-based systems processed by reactive milling</p><p>The possibilities to produce quaternary Mg-based transition-metal complex hydrides have been explored. Mg 2 Mn 1-x Fe x (x = 0.5, 0) elemental powder mixtures were ball milled in a reactive D 2 atmosphere (about 5 MPa). The results were compared with the formation of Mg 2 (FeD 6 ) 0.5 (CoD 5 ) 0.5 from Mg-Fe-Co powders. High resolution SR-PXD performed at BM01B was used in conjunction with neutron diffraction for the structural characterization of the as-milled powders. Mg 2 Mn 0.5 Fe 0.5 powder (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">17</ref>) showed a large fraction of unreacted elemental Mn, as well as the formation of a cubic K 2 PtCl 6 -type phase (a = 6.452 Å). The latter could be identified as Mg 2 FeD 6 . Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of [FeD 6 ] 4- anions (stretching band at 1261 cm -1 ) and ruled out the formation of [MnH 6 ] 5- complexes. High-resolution SR-PXD for as-milled Mg 2 Mn (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">18</ref>) showed the formation of MgD 2 as the main reaction product. A small fraction of a cubic K 2 PtCl 6 -type phase (a = 6.526 Å) was also observed. This was identified as an Mg 2 FeD 6 -type compound. It was likely formed as a result of Fe impurities originating from the milling media. The large cell parameter suggests partial dissolution on Mn in the Mg 2 FeD 6 -type phase. This is supported by the presence of an additional band at 1313 cm -1 in the IR spectrum. The results have been published in Faraday Discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> Structure determination of -Mg(BH 4 ) 2</p><p>Mg(BH 4 ) 2 has -and -polymorphs and the structures of these polymorphs have been reported. Recently, commercial Mg(BH 4 ) 2 has become available from Sigma-Aldrich, and the product is yet another polymorph, the so-called -phase.</p><p>It was found that the γphase transforms to an intermediate phase (tentatively named -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 ) after heating to 170 °C. -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 then transforms to the β phase after heating up to 210 °C. To determine structure of -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , high resolution SR-PXD data of -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 was collected at BM01B at room temperature. Figure 19(a) shows HR-SR-PXD data of the sample after annealing of γ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 at 160 C under 1 MPa H 2 atmosphere. Since no diffraction peaks from γ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 were observed, the profile is expected to be originated from -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , however, it may contain small amount of -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . HR-SR-PXD data of γ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 annealed at 210 C under 1 MPa H 2 atmosphere (Figure 19(b)) shows the presence of -phase without the odd-order reflections which would be observed as significantly weak and broad peak due to antisite disorder. Structure solution of -Mg(BH 4 ) 2 is currently in progress. </p></div>

The sample contains more Al than sample 1 and a smaller fraction of AlD 3 , showing an increased decomposition of AlD 3. The same problem of refining the diffraction from AlF 3 also holds for this sample and made the analysis difficult.
