<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to determine the influence of intrinsic strains on the metal-insulator first order phase transition, the Verwey transition (VT), in magnetite. Magnetite is a canonical compound, where strong electron-electron and electron-phonon [1] interactions cause the phase transformation at TV ≈ 124 K. VT is manifested in anomalies of principal physical quantities, like heat capacity, dynamical susceptibility (AC), electrical resistivity and crystal symmetry change from cubic Fd3m to low-T monoclinic Cc.</p><p>VT is actually a composite phenomenon <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> where the crystal symmetry, charge and orbital orders change at slightly different temperatures possibly creating some stress caused by those electronic and atomic inhomogeneities. The origin of these inhomogeneities is unknown, which rises the questions: are these intrinsic strains that cause subsystem separation, or, vice versa, inhomogeneities cause strain? And to what extent the strain affects the VT. For example, it is well known that hydrostatic pressure lowers TV [3], while TV is increased by uniaxial strain [4], so any microscopic strain certainly affects the transition. To elucidate this problem, we used dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) on three single crystalline, stoichiometric, samples identically oriented (the flat part was (001) plain), but grown with different method, i.e. possibly having some other strain system. JD3 sample (and the other one, of the same batch, "Jerome", not shown</p><p>121 122 123 124 125 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 0.012 JD3 (001) SM446 (001) chiprim[V] Ts[K]</p><p>Samples had their surface polished with lapping paper and were mounted with GE Varnish onto 3D-printed sample holders provided on the beamline below, but measured at 300 K) was grown using Travelling Solvent Floating Zone method, while the latter, SM446, with skull-melter technique at Purdue University, USA. Capturing the evolution of the internal texture of both samples above, in the vicinity and below TV was a crucial part of the conducted experiment. Our plans were to first observe the crystal lattice quality (by mosaicity and strain mapping) at 300 K and correlate it with identical experiments below the Verwey transition. Although the first part was partially successful, it required long time and only initial observation was performed below TV for only one sample. Therefore, we would like to apply for additional beamtime in future.</p><p>AC was used to measure the Verwey temperature (see. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). In both cases, the VT is very sharp, with TV for SM446 slightly greater by ~0.4 K. Both samples, with exposed (001) surface, were then observed in DFXM; beam size was 100 μm x 1 μm. Diffraction contrast was gained by the observation of the (004) peak, visible both in Fd3m and Cc phases. The results at 300 K, in the form of (004) peak profile in (, ) scans (altogether 440 pictures per each of the 4 explored positions along sample height, smz, in case of SM446, 11 smz in other samples) and corresponding mosaicity maps are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>,b and 3a,b respectively. The (004) peak profiles are similar for both samples, although SM446 is more mosaic than JD3. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>  Larger mosaicity in skull melter grown sample correlated with simultaneous slightly greater TV may suggest that more defected sample increases the stability of low-T electron system increasing TV. As already mentioned, TV decreases with hydrostatic pressure while increases when the stress is more uniaxial, what is probably also visible here.</p><p>Departures from the ideal crystal structure are inherent in low-T phase of magnetite, where Cc structure naturally forces the occurrence of crystal domains. Therefore, the studies of VT vs. intrinsic strain/mosaicity should be done below TV; this was our initial goal of the presented studies and this is what we want to achieve in follow-up studies.</p><p>There were good reasons that our goal was only partially achieved. First, more time than expected in a first place was spent in the Room Temperature (RT) studies. Since we needed three changes of LN2 cryostream due to vacuum issues that prevented us from getting to the transition temperature, and one cryostream refill, several hours were dedicated to the cryostream change requiring addition a temperature ramps. Dismounting a cryostream required removing the sample from the goniometer, hence leading to the need of realignment and scanning of the RT state of the sample for reference. The GE varnish did not hold the sample as nicely as expected, leading to additional remounts and realignments. Beamline experienced pco-edege camera crashed overnight cutting some of our programmed scans that needed to be repeated, and a computer crashed on the morning of Saturday that lead to 2-3h of standy for rebooting. In the same manner some scans were interrupted by electron beam loss. All these unwanted events resulted in at least 4 shifts losts, a number that could be much larger had it not been the help of ID6 beamline Staff.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1a .</head><label>1a</label><figDesc>Fig. 1a.
