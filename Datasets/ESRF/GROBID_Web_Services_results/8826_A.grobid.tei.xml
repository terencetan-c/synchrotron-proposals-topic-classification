<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was aimed at studying the breakdown of antiferromagnetic spin order in s7FeB0s single crystals at the Nkel temperature by measuring rocking curves of pure nuclear Bragg reflections. Such Bragg reflections originate exclusively from antiferromagnetic order, and their widths and intensities are expected to be a sensitive measure for the spatial and temporal extension of antiferromagnetic order.</p><p>The pure nuclear reflection (333) f o an almost perfect single crystal platelet of s7FeB03 was selected for the experiment. The crystal was mounted in a small oven as previously used for related studies /l-3/. Since this oven had only a limited temperature stability of about 0.03 K, the magnetic phase transition at the Ndel point (75.2 "C) was smoothed by the application of a weak external magnetic field. The measurements were performed in the 2/3 fill mode without time gating. In this case the nuclear reflection can be revealed only because of the extremely high suppression of the non-resonant reflection in the order of 10-l' /3/. At each temperature around the Nkel point, wide range and narrow range rocking curves of the reflection were measured.</p><p>For the evaluation of the measurements theoretical models and calculations are presently developed. The dynamical theory predicts a narrowing of the Bragg reflection rocking curves with decreasing susceptibility (determined by the scattering amplitude). In parallel, h owever, critical spin fluctuations cause an effective reduction of the characteristic scattering volumes, resulting in a broadening of the rocking curves. It was intended to exploit this effect for probing the fluctuations. In our case, however, the decrease of the nuclear susceptibility is of special nature. The initial four lines of the Mijssbauer reflection spectrum at room temperature collapse near the N&amp;l point into a nearly-single-line with finally vanishing amplitude. Since this process /4/ relies on the geometrical antiphase relation between the scattering amplitudes of the two s7Fe-nuclei in the unit cell, it depends on the angular deviation from the exact Bragg position, and might also lead to an effective broadening of the rocking curves. Characteristic wide range rocking curves at about -2, 0 and +0.7 'C with respect to the N&amp;l temperature are shown in Figs.la-lc, respectively. In this region the reflection peak intensity falls from 2000/s to 2/s, and the width of the reflection changes in a characteristic way. Details of this behaviour still have to be evaluated. It is obvious that in the present measurements a background of l/s conceals any possibly far reaching wings of the Bragg reflection. However, just the behaviour of these wings might be decisive for the interpretation of the rocking curves. Therefore future measurements have to be performed in a timing mode, where the background in the delayed window is much lower, characteristically about 0.02/s.</p><p>Besides the rocking curves, first tests of an angular exit analysis were performed. In this method the crystal under study is either at Bragg position OI set off Bragg by an angle a, and the angular dependence of the reflected radiation is scanned by means of another perfect crystal Bragg reflection. This analysis allows to distinguish a main peak displaced by 2a, a pseudo peak displaced by a and possibly a diffusive peak without displacement /5/. A n example for a strong diffusive peak probably due to a destroyed surface is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">28</ref>, where an exit analysis was performed for the reflection (111) of a Si crystal set at a=60". </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig.1 Rockiig curves of 57FeB03(333) at different Fig.2 Exit analyses of Si(ll1) (a) and of 57FeB03(222) temperatures below (a), at (b) and above (c) TN. at two temperatures below (b) and above (c) TN.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,22.32,289.96,401.04,291.12" type="vector_box" /></figure>
