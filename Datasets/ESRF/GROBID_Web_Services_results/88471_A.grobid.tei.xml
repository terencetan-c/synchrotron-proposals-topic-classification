<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>A The aim of the proposal was to investigate clustering and precipitation processes of Al-Cu based alloys in situ using small angle X-ray scattering.</p><p>Temperature ramps: To follow the precipitation path of Al alloy often differential scanning calorimetry is used as a standard method. With the in situ furnace at the station we tried to mimic the heating ramp conducted in our previous DSC measurements (20K/min, RT-673K) to get information on the precipitate size and volume fraction. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> one can observe the scattering images for an Al-Cu-Mg alloy during the heating ramp. The scattering signal in the first frame, which corresponds to 75°C, is completely isotropic. This suggests small non-oriented particles, e.g. pre-GPB-zones that are formed at this stage also represented by the exothermic peak in the DSC thermogram. At 115°C a faint and broad streak appears in the SAXS pattern, which is usually a sign of small and thin oriented particles such as the here suggested GPB zones.</p><p>Going to 150°C only a slight change in the scattering signal is visible until the streak disappears almost completely approaching 200°C. Finally, at about 275°C the scattering image shows intense streaking originating from the rod-like S-phase, as described by the sharp peak in the DSC curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).  Solute Clustering during room temperature: To investigate the effects of trace additions (100pm) of specific elements on the decomposition process of the Al-Cu-(Mg) alloys we followed the solute clustering in situ during room temperature ageing. Fig. 3 shows some of the obtained scattering curves with the respective model fits using the model of Ivanov et al. [1]. Fig. 4 displays the fitting parameters over time for the Al-Cu and Al-Cu-Mg alloys with and without additions of In or Sn. One can observe the significant difference between the Al-Cu and Al-Cu-In/Sn due to a vacancy binding effect of those elements. Suprisingly this effect does not show for the Al-Cu-Mg alloys. These data are already published and discussed in detail in [2].  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>detailed atomic investigation of the precipitations on a joint of a Friction-Stir-Welded Al-Cu-Li alloy (AA2198) Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
