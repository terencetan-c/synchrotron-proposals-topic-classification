<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Due to travel restrictions, we were unable to perform the experiment in person. 3D charge order was not observed in this sample, preventing the desired measurement. We were also unable to observe 3D charge ordering in the same sample after the beamtime by our previously successful methods, leading us to believe that something happened to the sample prior to this beamtime (e.g., us cleaving the sample too many times) which negatively impacted the charge density wave formation. Due to covidrelated impacts, we were unable to prepare additional samples for this beamtime but would like to repeat the experiment when we are able to provide multiple samples to significantly increase the likelihood of a successful experiment.</p></div>
