<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Obtain full dataset using XRF/XRD method on a full cell configuration Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) vs. LiFePO4 (LFP)</head><p>In this experiment we performed vertical linescans collecting simultaneous XRD and XRF data on full cells of LTO/LFP in a spiked solution of 1M LiPF6 + 0.1M LiAsF6 in EC:DMC (1:1). The As K peak was monitored as it is directly proportional to the concentration of Li + in the solution phase of the cell. The LFP being a 2phase material has separate reflexions for the discharged state (LFP) and its delithiated charged state (FP). The ratio of 2 characteristic reflexions from either structure gives the local state of charge (SoC) which is spatially resolved along with [Li + ] in solution. Two separate cells were measured (India and Lima).</p><p>Lima, fast: Cycling was performed at large and increasing currents, intially with full (dis)charge in 60 minutes, ending with less than 15 minutes. A return to the initial current was made at the end of the measurement cycle to ensure there was no sample degradation. The XRD and XRF results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) show an expected concentration gradient forming in both the solution and solid phase of the sample. The solution phase gradient is stronger near the current collector which is reasonable for a sample limited by mass transport in the electrolyte. The XRD results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) initially show a stronger gradient near the separator, and later close to the current collector. This could be the result of the charge being initially limited by mass transport in the electrolyte (gradient near separator). Once the separator side is fully delithiated, the local charging current density increases towards the current collector. India, first: This cell had not undergone any previous electrochemical measurents. As such we could investigate the "breaking-in" of the cell during the first charge/discharge cycle. The XRF/XRD method provides a crucial insight into early cycling effects that could be symptomatic of cell failure later. In particular we can closely monitor the electrolyte concentration throughout early cycles for early decomposition or SEI formation. Although the LTO anode used should be "SEI-free", we observe an increase in the solution phase As signal in both the cathode and anode during the first charge at a current of C/5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). Normal behaviour would see a drop in As signal (and therefore a decrease in [Li + ]) in the anode during charge. During the rest period after the first charge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), the As signal does not return to its initial state implying that the As has been deposited at the anode in the form of decomposition products or through precipitation. The majority of this deposit is present near the separator which could imply that this is a form of SEI which is reported for LTO but is known to degrade upon further cycling. A deeper investigation of the preliminary result will be required to understand the implications this has on the performance of the studied cell. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Compared fast-charging algorithms and analyzed real-world data from electric vehicle discharge profile</head><p>One of the main motivaions for developing the XRF/XRD method, is that it is currently difficult to assess the effect inside the battery of various fast-charging alogithms for electric vehicles. Specifically, the combined Time Time Time Time local solution phase concentration gradient and the state of charge in the solid material is not currently available. Pulsed charging techniques were the first target since these methods are designed to reduce the formation of concentration gradients. Two pulsed charging techniques were applied to the same cell: 1) a charging current of 1C with a 80% duty cycle and b) 2C at 40%. Analysis of the data (not shown) will answer the following questions:</p><p>1) Does the bulk electrochemistry (capacity, overpotential etc.) correspond to the measured solution/solid phase gradient information? 2) Which algorithm is better for mitigating concentration gradient formation? 3) Does the material charge more homogeneously than in constant current charging at equivalent currents?</p><p>3) Spatially resolve the LTO state-of-charge with XRD Determining the SoC in LTO is difficult as it is considered to be a "zero strain" solid solution material. The cell lattice fluctuates by 0.07% from the fully charged to fully discharged state. As such there has been no XRD report to our knowledge of the spatially resolved LTO state of charge given the resolution requirements.</p><p>Our preliminary results show that we can qualitatively detect the LTO SoC over the course of 3 charge/discharge cycles at a rate of 1C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The peak position of a characteristic reflexion is monitored as a function of time and is seen to correspond to the imposed current. Further analysis will lead to operando quantification of the LTO SoC with spatial and time resolution relevant for practical batteries for the first time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The data collected has enormous implications for furthering our understand of Li-ion batteries. The development of the XRF/XRD method opens the door to analysis of novel electrode architectures to determine performance limitation. Immediately, the data we have collected can be used to valdiate numerical models that have simulated LIB development for decades. We also report the first XRD operando spatially resolved determination of the LTO state of charge which is necessary for understanding the (dis)charge behaviour of this material, which is the "go to" comercial anode when high power is needed. Finally the practical comparison of fast-charging techniques using this method should once the data is fully analysed allow us to discern their performance improvement mechanism leading to rational design of superior algorithms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: a) XRD -ratio of LFP(dis)/FP(charged) during charge at 1C representing the state of charge in the solid phase as a function of position within LFP electrode. b) XRF -As K peak integral as a function of position within LFP electrode and normalized to response at rest.
