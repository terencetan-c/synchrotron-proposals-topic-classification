<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The focus of the experiment ES-1333 performed at ID18 was the determination of the iron oxidation state of Mg-chromite inclusions in natural lithospheric diamonds to develop a model of diamond formation and carbon freezing through redox processes involving spinel minerals. Nine diamonds from the Udachnaya kimberlitic pipe (Siberian craton) were selected based on the occurrence of multiple dark inclusions (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and their size varying from 50 to 200 microns. Diamonds with some exposed inclusions after polishing were also preferred for which the chemical composition could be directly analyzed by electron microprobe. Few tiny almost transparent inclusions were also observed under the microscope but not analysed. The proposed measurements were successfully conducted with a 6 x 15 µm 2 focused beam aligned with the camera with a total of 18 collected Mössbauer spectra. In detail, we measured 1) multiple Mg-chromite inclusions (both exposed on the polished surface and entrapped) in the same diamonds and 2) performed rim-to-core analyses on two large inclusions. Spectra were collected in about 3 hours and were fitted following literature models, including two doublets for Fe 2+ and one doublet for Fe 3+ (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The contribution from Fe impurities in the Be-lenses was well constrained by fitting an extra singlet using previous background measurements, as we also discussed in a manuscript recently published on Lithos, including data from ID18 (</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our calculations of the local oxygen fugacity are made possible thanks to the collected data and resulted in logfo2 lower (about -2 log units FMQ) than the Udachnaya spl-peridotite xenoliths from which these diamonds were extracted, implying that these inclusions are likely to be protogenetic. On the other hand, a stronger application of current oxythermobarometry would require the determination of Fe 3+ /∑Fe also in olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene also entrapped in the same diamonds. Finally, the collected data will be integrated with already available synchrotron X-ray tomography and diffraction analysis aimed to elastic barometry applications for accurate P-T estimates.</p><p>The feasibility of the proposed research certainly relies on the beamline set-up, in particular on the possibility of easily centering the selected inclusions using the camera aligned with the X-ray. For this reason, the beamtime session was efficient and allowed measuring the Fe 3+ /∑Fe of all the selected Mg-chromite inclusions achieving the beamtime goal. The presence of additional minerals was noted while loading the sample holders thanks to the high zoom of the provided microscope sited in the preparation lab. To date, the Fe 3+ /∑Fe of mineral inclusions in P-type diamonds like olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene remains poorly investigated and we anticipate this being the target of a next beamtime request. Further investigations of these mineral inclusions could help to constrain not only the P-T-fo2 conditions for diamond formation but also the partitioning behavior of Fe 3+ among minerals in diamonds. Some preliminary analyses on different samples were also performed that allowed to end on-going projects. Among these, three analyses were conducted on mineral inclusions in a lithospheric diamond from Brazil, for which in situ synchrotron single crystal X-ray diffraction assisted by tomography, micro-FTIR and Raman, electron microprobe and laser ablation data were already available. A manuscript is going to be submitted. Two Fe 3+ /ΣFe measurements of spinel inclusions in olivine crystals were performed with the aim to retrieve the redox conditions of a wehrlitic sample from Mt. Vulture. These analyses are included in a paper recently published in the European Journal of Mineralogy (<ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.5194/ejm-35-665-2023">https://doi.org/10.5194/ejm-35-665-2023</ref>). One measurement was conducted on a carbonate-silicate glass for which the atomic structure, Raman and FTIR data were already available. The result was included in a manuscript submitted to Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (Stopponi and coauthors, under review). Finally, preliminary analyses were performed on synthetic charges polished on both sides to expose coexisting glass (with basalt composition) and minerals. These test analyses allow the Fe 3+ partitioning (DFe 3+ ) between glass and mineral to be determined by Mössbauer measurements. The successfully acquired spectra on the synthetic glasses and the coexisting pyroxenes will be used to support the next beamtime application, but they will be also presented in the frame of the AGU fall meeting (2023). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 P-type diamond with inclusions analyzed at ID18 (left) and example of Mössbauer spectrum acquired on a Mgchromite during experiment ES-1333 (right).</figDesc><graphic coords="2,192.90,153.24,166.03,124.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
