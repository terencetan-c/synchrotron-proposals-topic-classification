<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Single-crystals of MnGe, Mn 0.1 Co 0.9 Ge were selected and prepared for high-pressure x-ray diffraction experiment. The experiment was mostly focused on low-temperature study of MnGe elastic properites below magnetic ordering temperature (the ordering temperature is around 150 K), Mn 0.1 Co 0.9 Ge was used as an almost non-magnetic reference. We used diamond anvil cells filled with He as a pressure-transmitting medium. Helium cryostat was utilized to maintain the temperature of 100 K over the whole pressure range. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction images were further analyzed using the computer program CrysAlisPro in order to determine the orientation matrices and estimate the lattice parameters. X-ray diffraction images, taken upon continuous rotation of the DAC from -20• to +20• on omega (referred to as wide-scan images) were analysed with GSE ADA software. As a result, the dependences of the unit cell parameters on pressure were obtained.</p><p>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the Ff-plots (Eulerian stress-strain diagram) along with our previously measured room temperature data. The equations of state (EOS) were fitted by EosFit7 in terms of Birch-Murnaghan 3-rd order model. The quality of fit is seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The corresponding parametrs are summurized in the Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. It is seen that the elastic properties of Mn 0.1 Co 0.9 Ge at room temperature and at 100 K coinside within the error. Unlike that the bulk modulus for MnGe is markedly different below and above the magnetic transition temperature. The further investigation of this anomaly including ab initio calculations is to be done. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.
