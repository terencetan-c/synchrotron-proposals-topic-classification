<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Vanadium sesquioxide (V2O3) is a paradigmatic example of a Mott-Hubbard insulator in which a rich phase diagram results from the strong electron correlation and the competing degrees of freedom. The V2O3 system presents multiple phases that have dramatic differences in structural, electrical, optical and magnetic behavior. In bulk, undoped V2O3 undergoes a phase transition at a temperature of TMIT ~160K from a paramagnetic metallic phase (PM) to an anti-ferromagnetic insulating one (AFI), characterized by an abrupt increase in resistivity of over 7 decades. This phase transition is accompanied by a structural one from a corundum structure to a monoclinic one. In thin films, the effect of substrate mismatch, interfaces and stoichiometry can play an important role in the structural and electronic phase transitions. For example, for ultra-thin films (thickness below 5 nm) the metal-insulator transition (MIT) is suppressed in strained films grown directly on Al2O3 substrates while the transition is preserved when using an almost lattice-matched buffer layer in between. Hence, it is of great importance to have a good understanding of how the local properties influence the macroscopic responses. The aim of the present proposal is to study the structural properties of pure V2O3 films across the MIT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details and Results</head><p>Due to the COVID-19 situation this beamtime was split in two periods. The first one from 18/11/2020 till 21/11/2020 (9 shifts, remotely) and the second one from 01/11/2021 till 05/11/2021 (9 shifts, in person). The samples studied during the two sessions of the experiments are: Sample 0001 (37 nm V2O3 on Al2O3): Comprehensive series of L-and theta-scans at RT and at 80 K. Snapshots at specific H K L position as a function of temperature while warming up from 80 K to RT. X-ray reflectometry at RT. L-and theta-scans around different reflections ((1 0 10), (-2 4 6) and (0 1 8)) at T = 220 K, 160 K, 140 K, 120 K, 100 K, 80 K. Sample 0003a (4nm V2O3 on Al2O3): various L-and theta-scans at RT. Sample VO_14 (62nm V2O3 on 38nm Cr2O3 buffer layer on Al2O3): Snapshots of HKL = (-2 4 6) and (-1 2 9) while cooling down and warming up between RT and 80 K. L-and theta-scans around different reflections ((1 0 10), (-2 4 6) and (0 1 8)) at T = 220 K, 160 K, 140 K, 120 K, 100 K, 80 K.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ultra-thin films: SM0006 (3 u.c. V2O3 on Al2O3), SM0007 (1 u.c. V2O3 on Al2O3), SM0011 (1 u.c. V2O3 on Cr2O3/ Al2O3), SM0012 (3 u.c. V2O3 on Cr2O3/ Al2O3). L-and theta-scans around reflections (1 0 10) and (3 0 0) reflections at RT (SM0006, SM0007, SM0011) and at 80 K (SM0006, SM0012). HAXPES experiments could not be performed as the substrates are highly insulating.</p><p>The reciprocal space maps constructed from the L-and theta-scans as a function of temperature in thick V2O3 films (Sample 0001 and VO_14) show the formation of three diffraction peaks in the ab-plane oriented at 120° from each other at temperatures around 160 K. These three lobes disappear when cooling further down to 100 K. At that same temperature, the diffraction peak in the c-direction (out-of-plane) splits into three peaks (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This behavior has been observed in both samples (Sample <ref type="table">0001</ref> and <ref type="table">VO_14) with different thickness  (37nm</ref> and <ref type="table">62nm)</ref> and <ref type="table">grown on different surfaces (Al2O3</ref> and <ref type="table">Cr2O3/ Al2O3</ref>). This indicates that the observed structural evolution with temperature is an intrinsic property of the MIT in V2O3. Preliminary analysis of the reciprocal space maps of 3 u.c. thick V2O3 films at RT and 80 K indicate that there is no structural phase transition when the film is grown directly on Al2O3 substrate. The RT high-angle diffraction shows that there is a reduction of the c-axis lattice parameter when reducing the thickness of the film from 3 u.c to 1 u.c.. Sample 0003a seem to be degraded, likely due to being exposed to air for too long time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and future work</head><p>As mentioned in the abstract the MIT in V2O3 is accompanied by a structural transition from a corundum structure to a monoclinic one (PM to AFI transition). The observation of three preferential directions in the diffraction peaks when going through the MIT is rather unexpected. In similar V2O3 films, we have previously observed by means of PEEM (Photoemission electron microscopy) the formation of stripe domains in the AFI phase oriented at 120° with each other. These domains were associated with the three possible directions for the monoclinic distortion to take place. The in-depth analysis of the diffraction data collected in this beamtime will be crucial to understand the microscopic details of the structural phase transition and the relation with the striped nanostructured observed previously in V2O3 films. In the future, the growth of V2O3 films on less insulating substrates will be investigated. This could allow the study of structure and composition of the films with depth resolution as a function of temperature. The preliminary analysis of the results on the ultra-thin samples indicate that the observed structural changes can be correlated to a metal-insulator transition due to quantum confinement when reducing the thickness to a single unit cell. Further diffraction studies along different crystalline orientations can be helpful to have a complete picture of the structural characteristics of this phase transition. Due to technical problems at ESRF the beam was down for considerable time during our beamtime. Therefore, it was not possible to complete the set of measurements planned for this experiment.</p><p>220 K 160 K 140 K 80 K 120 K 100 K Al2O3 V2O3</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. 22L scans as a function of temperature on 37 nm thick V2O3 film grown on Al2O3 substrate</figDesc><graphic coords="3,90.61,328.87,211.86,88.63" type="bitmap" /></figure>
