<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we used nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) to measure the Eu-partial density of phonon states as a function of temperature (from 4 K up to 300 K) and external magnetic field (up to 1.1 T). When being measured, the samples were under vacuum ~10 -6 mbar in a helium flow cryostat, furnished with kapton window for X-ray beam. The grazing incidence geometry was used with the wave vector of the incident photons parallel to [010] as well as <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref> directions of the EuO(001), that corresponds to ΓKX and ΓX directions of the Brillouin zone, respectively. The incident X-ray energy was tuned to the resonant transition energy (21.54 keV) of the 151 Eu nuclei with an energy resolution ~ 1 meV. The spectra were recorded using the total delayed fluorescence yield. In addition, time spectra of nuclear forward scattering were recorded, allowing determination of the Eu magnetic state.</p><p>We carried out the entire experimental program: we measured Eu NIS spectra on high-guality Eu 1-x Gd x O films, MBE-grown on both Si and YSZ with different doping level, in a wide temperature range. However, unlike basic result received previously by the other group, we have not observed any broadening of the TA phonon density peak at low temperature, ascribed to giant spin-phonon coupling. On the contrary, the peak demonstrates an opposite behaviour, becoming narrower below the ferromagnetic transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Encouraging aspect, however, can be found in the temperaure dependence of the forward scattering spectra. Oscillating character of the time decay points to certain magnetic ordering within the sample, while in paramagnetic matter it is expected to show up as an exponential decay. In our case oscillating structure is detected even above the ferromagnetic transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We believe, this feature is indicative of magnetic polarons in Eu 1-x Gd x O film. Thorough analisys of the spectra is being carried out.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
