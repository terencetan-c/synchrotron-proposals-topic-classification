<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Physical properties of nano-sized metal hydrogen systems strongly change with mechanical stress, evolving during hydrogen loading and phase transition. For very thin films this stress relaxation process is expected to be much less efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> as systems will stay in the coherent state <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, hereby changing their thermodynamic properties and phase stabilities. To study the impact of coherency and mechanical stress contributions on the thermodynamics and kinetics of nano-sized systems, different metal-hydrogen thin film systems (M-H systems, M = Pd, Nb) are used as model systems at BM20. Epitaxial Niobium (8 nm and 33nm ) and Palladium (100nm and 80 nm) thin films were charged and dischared electrochemically and with gaseous hydrogen. Accompanying changes of the out-of-plane lattice parameters and the generation of hydride phases were monitored on site by means of Bragg-Geometry. Measurement on ZnO were omitted because of the reduced number of awarded shifts (12 instead of 24).</p><p>For the NbH system, coherent (8nm) and semi-coherent (33nm) phase transition regimes were investigated by electrochemical charging. Experimental observation showed that samples wetted with electrolyte posses arbitrary transformation to the hydride phase under interaction with the X-Ray beam. Thereby, the electrolyte was removed from the film after each step-by-step loading to perform XRD scans. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the diffraction pattern evolution (Nb 110) of the α phase of the 33 nm film is shown as a function of hydrogen concentration for the first loading cycle. Precipitation of the hydride phase starts at an average hydrogen concentration of c α =0.21 [H/Nb], reflected in the appearence of second hydride related peak, as marked in the graph. Therefore, in comparison to the bulk system with c α =0.06 H/Nb, the solubility limit is strongly shifted to higher concentrations. This shift is mainly attributed to large in-plane mechanical stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Before the phase transformation starts, the α-phase Nb peak (110) moves to the lower reflection angles, exhibiting a strong out-of-plane lattice expansion of up to 1.8%. Additionally, thickness fringes are visible for the low concentration range, which reveal very smooth surface conditions. In the two phase region, the thickness fringes irreversibally disappear, reflecting on lattice deterioration during hydride precipitation: above a certain H concentration, initially coherent hydride precipitates loose their corerency with the surrounding α-matrix and become semi-coherent due to the emission of misfit dislocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>In case of thinner films (8 nm) no separation between the hydride peak and α-phase peak has been found (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Only one broad peak moving forward to the lower angle range has been observed, revealing the conservation of coherency at hydride/-matrix interface. For this film thickness the thickness fringes are found to have a reversible behaviour in the loading/unloading experiment. In the transformation regime a destabilization of the hydride phase was observed, which fastly decomposed when the sample was exposed to atmosphere. This is attributed to the high internal mechanical stress and desorption supported by the presence of oxygen. To reduce this effect, in future the H loading will be carried out from the gas phase only, where the hydrogens' chemical potential can be kept constant during the XRD measurements and oxygen contributions can be controlled more easily. To study the properties of surface hydride formation with respect to the lateral stress contribution, epitaxial Pd-films films have been measured by use hydrogen gas loading in-situ XRD. The samples were prepared at 400 o C and treated by Ar-ion bombardment to produce a ripples-like surface structure (periodic waves: 2nm height, 5nm width, 100nm length). Two samples were measured: 100 nm thick + ion-bombarded for 60 sec and 80 nm thick + ion-bombarded for 120 sec. The rippled film surface has a quasi-free volume, that can expand freely in all 3 dimensions -except for that region at the interface linked to the underlying compact film. It is, thereby, strongly reduced in lateral mechanical stress and hydride formation was expected to occur at a lower hydrogen pressure compared to conventional clamped films. This assumption is strongly supported by the conducted measurements, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. As can be seen, first hydride precipitation in the initially 100 nm thick sample has been already found during the first loading step at about 49 mbar pressure. The small hydride peak stays unchanged up to 69mbarsupporting its interpretation as surface hydride forming in the riplples volumes. Only at pressures exceeding 69 mbar the complete clamped film starts to transform to the hydride phase. For the initially 80 nm thick sample this feature was not found (See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Such a difference is attributed to the different film/substrate composite stress contribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, the detailed origin of this effect is still under debate. Competing processes like ripple formation and film erosion complicate the situation here. Additional measurements at the home institution are ongoing to clarify the interpretation.
