<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to conduct simultaneous in situ EXAFS, SAXS and WAXS measurements of Pd@Pt xML /C PEM fuel cell catalysts under potential control. To accomplish this aim we:</p><p>1. Employed a newly developed electrochemical cell (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) which enabled the simultaneous collection of EXAFS, SAXS and WAXS data while the catalyst electrode was under potential control in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . This meant that the catalyst electrodes could be studied in the oxidised and reduced states synonymous with those experienced in a working fuel cell environment. The electrocatalysts studied in this experiment were Pd@Pt 0.5ML /C and Pd@Pt 1ML /C, investigating the effect of Pt-shell thickness on the structural response of the catalyst to the applied electrode potential using both fresh and electrochemically aged samples.</p><p>2. BM26A was set up for the first time to record simultaneous EXAFS, SAXS and WAXS. EXAFS was recorded initially at the Pd K edge after which the energy was changed to the Pt L 3 edge. SAXS and WAXS measurements were then recorded after stabilisation of the in situ cell current, followed immediately by three EXAFS scans. Each measurement was carried out at four potentials, obtaining data in the double layer region, the oxide region and at two potentials in the hydride region to study hydride adsorption as well as hydride absorption into the Pd core.</p><p>The SAXS data obtained could not be fully analysed due to the low concentration of metal nanoparticles in the samples -for future experiments higher catalyst loadings will be used.</p><p>The WAXS data was analysed qualitatively, with differences seen between the catalysts at different potentials, however, an angular reference was not obtained which meant that the data could not be analysed quantitatively.</p><p>The EXAFS data collected was of good quality. At the Pd K edge, a phase shift could be seen in the data for Pd@Pt 0.5ML /C at 0.0 V corresponding to lattice expansion due to hydride absorption, thus indicating that the Pd core was exposed in places as would be expected from 0.5ML Pt coverage. Oxide growth, however, was not seen at 1.0 V which would have been expected if the core was exposed. One possible explanation for this is that the Pd oxide was dissolving. Evidence of Pt oxide growth was seen in the Pt L 3 edge data. For the Pd@Pt 1ML /C, the phase shift due to hydride absorption in the Pd K edge data was not observed, whereas Pd oxide growth was seen. This suggests that whilst the Pt coverage was high enough to prevent lattice expansion, it was not complete enough to prevent Pd oxide growth. The Pt L 3 edge data showed oxide growth at 1.0 V. Further differences were seen between the fresh and cycled electrodes and the results are currently being compiled for publication.  Results of this work were presented as an invited oral contribution at the International Symposium on Electrocatalysis in August 2010 at Kloster Irsee, Germany, and as a poster at the annual meeting of the International Society of Electrochemistry in September 2010 in Nice, France.</p><p>We would like to thank Sergey Nikitenko, Miguel Silveira and Wim Bras for all of their assistance during the experiments.</p><p>--1.5 --1.0 --0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 0 5 10 15 k 2 χ(k) k / Å --1 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 0 2 4 6 |χ (R)| / Å --3 R / Å --1.5 --1.0 --0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 0 5 10 15 k 2 χ(k) k / Å --1 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0 2 4 6 |χ (R)| / Å --3 R / Å</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
