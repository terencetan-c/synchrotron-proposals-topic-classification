<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was the study of the mechanical properties of FCC Au crystals and BCC Fe crystals by in situ nano-indentation in combination with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI). In order to avoid any vibrations induced by moving diffractometer motors we intended to record 3D coherent X-ray diffraction patterns by scanning the energy of the incident X-ray beam instead of rocking the sample. KB mirrors, which are achromatic focusing optics, were mandatory for this experiment. They were delivered by the end of 2016 and commissioned in January 2017. We thus divided our experiment into two parts. During the first part, ordinary Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on Au and Fe crystals to select defect free and strain free crystals for the second part which focused on the in situ nano-indentation.</p><p>Gold and iron crystals were prepared on sapphire substrates by dewetting magnetron sputtered Au, respectively, Fe thin films with a thickness of 45 nm at ~900 °C for at least 24 hours. During the dewetting process the thin films agglomerate forming a large number of well-facetted crystals which are all oriented with the Au(111), respectively, the Fe(110) plane parallel to the substrate surface. For BCDI the 8 keV X-ray beam was focused down to 500 x 500 nm 2 using a Fresnel zone plate. Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction images of the Fe 110 and the Au 111 Bragg peaks of the correponding crystals are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) and (b), respectively. The BCDI of the Au crystal displays well-pronounced size fringes demonstrating its defect free and strain free character. The BCDI of Fe crystals on the contrary only shows thickness fringes while the lateral size fringes are totally blurred because of a large residual strain within the crystals. Due to these experimental findings we decided to perform the nano-indentation experiments on the Au crystals exclusively. The reconstructed phase obtained from the coherent diffraction pattern shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>) is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d</ref>) demonstrating the successful inversion of a BCDI obtained by scanning the energy. For in situ nanoindentation the in-situ AFM "SFINX" was installed on the diffractometer. The crystals, the AFM-tip, and the focused X-ray beam were aligned with respect to each other recording AFMtopography (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)</ref>) and scanning X-ray diffraction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(b</ref>)) using the k-map approach. Prior to indentation, 3D coherent X-ray diffraction patterns of individual Au crystals were recorded both by ordinary rocking scans and by the energy scanning method. Both techniques provide the same results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) and (c)), thus validating the energy scanning approach which was susbequently used for the in situ nanoindentation studies. During nano-indentation 2D coherent X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded which were cross-correlated in situ. As soon as the AFM-tip touches the upper facet of the Au crystal (indicated by a sharp decrease of the amplitude Fig 2 <ref type="figure">.(c</ref>)), the 2D diffraction pattern is modified being clearly visible in the in situ cross-correlation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d))</ref>. The indentation process was interrupted at pre-defined loads and 3D coherent X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded by scanning the X-ray energy by +/-250 eV. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>) to e) display XZ slices of the reconstructed phase of individual Au crystal for : 0 µN, 1.75 µN, 2.75 µN , 4.75 µN and 5.75 µN. We clearly evidence changes in the central part of the diffraction peak itself (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(f)), such as a splitting , indicating a modification of the internal strain of the crystal, which translates in the reconstructions by the appearance of a second domain in the crystal. To our knowledge this experiment reported here is the first in-situ nanoindentation test combining coherent Bragg diffraction imaging. These experiments are very promising and it paves the way to a better understanding of the onset of plasticity and the different types of defect nucleated in scarce or defect-free nanostrutures. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Integrated Qx, Qy slices of the 3D diffraction pattern of a a) rocking curve of a Fe nano-crystal, b) rocking curve of a Au nano-crystal, c) an energy scan of the same Au nano-crystal as in (b). d) 3D reconstructions of the phase from the coherent diffraction pattern shown in (c).</figDesc></figure>
