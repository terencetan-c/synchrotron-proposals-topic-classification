<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Upon an electric current larger than a threshold, an incommensurate Charge Density Wave (CDW) may slides as a whole, hence transporting a non-ohmic current. The aim of this proposal was to study the deformation of the CDW in the sliding state of NbSe 3 by using coherent x-ray diffraction.</p><p>NbSe 3 develops an incommensurate CDW under a temperature of 145K with a wave vector Q=2k F .</p><p>The lattice modulation gives rise to pairs of satellite reflections around the Bragg peaks at ±2k F in the x-ray spectra.</p><p>Good coherence conditions were obtained with 150X150mm 2 (HXV) secondary slits and 10 mm pinholes placed at 20 cm before the sample. The 15µm*0.5µm*1mm sample lied on a sapphire substrate to avoid vibration (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The sample has been mounted inside a He cryostat (provided by the sample environment group), with the (H0L) plane in the horizontal diffraction plane, and (0 q c +1.241 0) satellite reflection has been probed at 120K. 2D speckle patterns has been measured within a direct-illumination CCD camera with 22 mm pixel size, located at 1.5m from the sample (dq=4.5 10 5 Å -1 at 8keV).</p><p>The speckle pattern has been measured as respect to electric currents, larger than the threshold current. As soon as we put electric current, the 2k F satellite reflection displays speckles along the transverse direction only. For electric current larger than the threshold, the number of speckles decreases and the 2k F satellite tends to recover his original unstrained shape. For larger currents (i.e. for larger sliding velocity), the CDW recovers its phase coherence. By lack of time, we have studied the CDW dynamics until small electric currents only (between 0.2mA to 1.8mA with a 1.2mA threshold current). For the next experience, we have to choose a larger cristal to be able to increase the external current far above the threshold.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: 2k F satellite reflection (0 1.241 0) in NbSe 3 under electric currents for I=0, 0.5, 1.4 and 1.8mA at T=120K. As soon as some electric current is applied, the reflection becomes larger along the transverse direction and speckles appear. When the current is increased above the threshold, the number of speckles decreases and the 2k F satellite tends to recover his original unstrained shape</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure1</head><figDesc>Figure1 : a) Derivative resistance as respect the external current in NbSe3 displaying the threshold current at Is=1.2 mA. b) Image of the sample liying on the sapphire substrate.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,203.76,628.80,107.28,114.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
