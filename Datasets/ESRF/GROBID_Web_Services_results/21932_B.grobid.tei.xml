<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>High-resolution powder diffraction data were collected on three microporous materials during this run: the aluminosilicate CAS-1 (from Chun Feng Xue, Taiyuan, China), the clathrasil RFS-105 (from A. Corma, Valencia, Spain), and the aluminophosphate IST-1 (from F. Ribeiro, Lisbon, Portugal). All have novel and unknown framework structures.</p><p>The CAS-1 data could be indexed on a monoclinic unit cell (a = 24.1677 Å, b = 7.0205 Å, c = 6.4858 Å, b = 95.24˚) and will be used in combination with data we have collected on a textured sample (experiment CH-1318).</p><p>Although the pattern of the clathrasil RFS-105 is of high quality, indexing has proven to be a problem. We are currently investigating the possibility that an unidentified impurity is present in the sample.</p><p>The data for the aluminophosphate IST-1 are of excellent quality. The pattern was indexed on an orthorhombic unit cell (a = 9.615 Å, b = 8.669 Å, c = 16.220 Å), and the systematic absences indicated that the most probable space groups were either Pcam (standard setting Pbcm) or Pca2 1 . Although 27 Al MAS NMR data indicated the presence of 4-, 5-and 6-coordinate Al, it was hoped that the framework could still be regarded as a 4-connected net and that these Al species had simply incorporated additional ligands into their coordination spheres. This would mean that the program focus, which was written specifically for determining zeolite (3-dimensional 4-connected) framework structures from powder diffraction data [1,2], could be applied. Reflection intensities were extracted from the pattern and structure solution was attempted in both space groups. A framework structure consistent with alternating Al and P atoms was found in the noncentrosymmetric space group Pca2 1 . Subsequent difference Fourier maps allowed an oxygen species bridging between two Al of the framework and two crystallographically distinct methylamine species to be found. One of the latter is coordinated directly to an Al atom while the other is in the channels of the framework. The final structure (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  [1] Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W., <ref type="bibr">McCusker, L.B. and Baerlocher, Ch., J. Appl. Crystallogr., 30, 985-995 (1997)</ref> [2] Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W., <ref type="bibr">McCusker, L.B. and Baerlocher, Ch., J. Appl.

The structure of IST-1.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>) is consistent not only with the 27 Al MAS NMR results (3 Al sites with 3 different coordination numbers), but also with 31 P (3 P sites) and 13 C (2 different methylamine species) data. Rietveld refinement of this model converged with the error indices R F = 0.042 and R wp = 0.125 (R exp = 0.043) (Figure 2).</figDesc></figure>
