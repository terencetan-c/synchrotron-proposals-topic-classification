<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Nanoparticles, particularly TiO 2 -NP, are included in a growing number of commercial products, and among them it is used as additive in drugs and food. The first objective of this study was to determine if TiO 2 -NP are able to be internalized in gastrointestinal cells and to cross a reconstituted gastrointestinal epithelium, which would be a proof of potential contamination of consumers. This was studied by µ-X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) mapping of Ti distribution in cells, cultivated on semi-permeable transwell membranes, and exposed for 6-48h to anatase or rutile TiO 2 -NP, with diameters 12 and 20 nm, respectively. The second objective was to prove that TiO 2 -NP did not dissolve and that their cristalline phase was not modified after cell uptake and transepithelial translocation. Local X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis (µ-XAS) at the Ti K-edge was carried out on Ti-rich regions identified inside cells. This experiment was the following of experiment MD464), where this analytical strategy had been applied to Caco-2 enterocytes exposed to TiO2-NPs. In the present experiment, we addressed these questions on more representative cell models, i.e. the Caco-2/HT29-MTX coculture which is a good model of mucus-secreting epithelium that lines the intestine, and the Caco-2/RajiB coculture which is a model of follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), present in the most distal part of the ileum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>The Caco-2/HT29-MTX <ref type="bibr">(Mahler et al., 2009)</ref> and Caco-2/RajiB <ref type="bibr">(Des Rieux et al., 2007)</ref> co-cultures were grown on porous transwell ® -clear polyester membranes (Costar) until they reached late confluence, ensuring that epithelia were fully differenciated. They were then exposed for 6h, 12h, 24h or 48h, on their apical side, to 12 nm anatase TiO 2 -NP (A12) or 20 nm rutile TiO 2 -NP (R20). Cells were then fixed using a two step procedure (paraformaldehyde and osmium), dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Transversal sections (thickness: 1 µm) of these samples were then cut using a ultramicrotome, deposited on ultralen polymer and covered by a thin layer of ultralen. These sections were directly analyzed (µXRF and µXAS). µXRF maps of Ti, K, Ca, Os/P and Cl were drawn, at 5.05 keV. XAS analyses were performed on cell regions containing high amounts of Ti; spectra were registered between 4900 and 5050 eV. Epoxy resin did not cause any interference in fluorescence signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>TiO 2 -NP accumulated in both cell models, in much higher amounts in these two co-cultures than in the Caco-2 monoculture that we used for experiment MD464. Accumulation was time-dependent: cells exposed for 48h accumulated more TiO 2 -NP than cells exposed for shorter periods. On the Caco-2/HT29-MTX model, we did not observe any translocation of TiO2-NPs through the epithelium, contrary to the Caco-2/RajiB epithelium, where some NPs were observed in the basolateral compartment. This proves that TiO 2 -NP are able to cross a reconstituted FAE, whereas they are unable to cross a reconstituted regular ileum epithelium. Mucus secretion increases TiO 2 -NP accumulation in gut cells, since NP accumulation was much higher in the Caco-2/HT29-MTX model than in the Caco-2 monoculture model. This was confirmed by PIXE analysis, that enabled quantification of TiO 2 -NP intracellular accumulation. Our results were also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. This distribution of TiO 2 -NP was observed independently of their crystal phase. During experiment MD588, we also analyzed the translocation of TiO 2 -NP through ex vivo-exposed mice gut epithelium. This experiment confirmed the results obtained in vitro, i.e. TiO 2 -NP can cross the gut epithelium. These results are currently being published (article in revision in Particle and Fibre Toxicology).</p><p>Ctl NP Ex vivo v . lumen lumen v . In vitro ap. bl. XAS spectra were recorded in Ti-rich regions of cell sections, and compared to spectra of reference compounds, e.g. anatase and rutile TiO 2 -NP which have not been exposed to cellular environment. As described in several publications, Ti pre-edge features are characteristic of the crystalline phase and size of TiO 2 -NP. Anatase displays a typical triplet feature (A1, A3 and B peaks), with a weak shoulder on the lowenergy side of the central A3 peak (A2) <ref type="bibr">(Manzini et al., 1995)</ref>. The intensity of A2 peak is related to the distorsion of the octahedral TiO 6 unit, particularly the distorsion observed on the surface of nanoparticle. The intensity of this peak is thus related to the size of the particle: the smaller the nanoparticle, the higher this A2 peak <ref type="bibr">(Luca et al., 1998)</ref>. Meanwhile, the intensity of the A1 peak also decreases as the particle size decreases <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 1997)</ref>. In rutile XAS pre-edge feature, no A2 peak is observed, A3 peak is more intense while B peak is shifted to +1.3 eV as compared to B peak in anatase pre-edge. Analysis of this preedge region may then inform on changes in the crystalline phase of nanoparticles after cell internalization, and on their dissolution. In the present experiment, no modification of these pre-edge features was observed after cell internalization of anatase or rutile TiO 2 -NP, meaning that Ti is still in the nanoparticulate TiO 2 chemical form inside cells, and that their crystalline phase did not change. Moreover the size of NP remained constant after cell internalization meaning that no partial dissolution of NP occurred. G. Veronesi further analyzed the EXAFS spectra of rutile TiO 2 -NPs accumulated in the Caco-2/RajiB model, and showed that the local environement around Ti atoms was exactly the same in intracellularly stored TiO2-NPs than in control nanopowders. These results were published <ref type="bibr">(Veronesi et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and perspectives</head><p>In conclusion we demonstrated in this experiment that raw, pure TiO 2 -NP, either anatase or rutile, were translocated through an in vitro reconstituted FAE, but not through an in vitro model of regular ileum. TiO 2 -NP did not dissolve, their crystal phase did not change in the intracellular environment upon sequestration for up to 48 h. TiO2-NPs are not the unique NPs introduced in food. Now that we optimized the experimental procedure to prepare cells for µXRF/µXAS analysis, it would be interesting to use this acquired expertise to analyze the fate of other types of NPs that are also presnet in food products, such as silver NPs. </p></div>
