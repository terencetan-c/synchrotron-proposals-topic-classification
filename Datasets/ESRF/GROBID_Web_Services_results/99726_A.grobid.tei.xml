<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We conducted a synchrotron-based anomalous (ASAXS) with conventional small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) experiment to study the liquid and ion rearrangement upon drying and wetting of aqueous electrolyte-filled nanoporous carbon. The aim of the study is to provide fundamental mechanistic insights in the drying processes, in terms of the coupling of thermodynamics and transport processes in the porous medium. Thus, it potentially allows for an appropriate design of electrodes to be used in wetting-drying energy harvesting applications.</p><p>The samples are prepared by using a nanoporous, CMK-8 carbon powder with a cubic pore symmetry. The powder is rolled in a hotpress together with 15 wt% PTFE to form 350µm thick thin-films with a lateral size of approximately 1.5cm x 2.5cm. These films are fixated on a frame, which is attached to a sample holder. The whole sample is installed in an in situ measurement cell. The cell has two nalophan-foil windows on front and backside, where the incedence and scattered X-ray beam passes through. It is filled at the bottom with a 1M RbBr electrolyte solution. The sample is only in contact with the solution at its very bottom. A humidifier with</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Figure: 1 In situ measurement cell.</formula><p>a humidity sensor is connected at the top of the cell. Hence, it is possible to influence the humidity inside the measurement cell. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a picture of the measurement setup.</p><p>For a typical measurement the sample is stored in a glass beaker with 1M RbBr solution for at least three hourse so that the electrolyte solution fully fills the sample. The sample is then installed in the cell and the humidty is set to &gt;95%RH. Hence, the evaporation of the solution from the sample is negligible. First of all, it is checked, if the sample behaves as desired in an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurement. All samples investigated, showed a clear capacitive behaviour. Bromid anions are stored in the electric double layer that forms on the surface of the nanoporous carbon. More charge is stored when the potential is increased and anions are expelled from the double layer when the potential is decreased. Without an applied potential the positive surface charge of the carbon surface shuld preferentially attract the bromide anions.</p><p>After the electrochemical check, a first SAXS measurement is conducted. The result can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> in comparison to a completely unfilled sample in a dry, inert atmosphere. The measurements are already normalized to the intensity of a SAXS measurement on a water capillary and to the intensity influenced by the cell, i.e. the cell-windows and the humid atmosphere inside the cell. It is plotted versus the wave vecor transfer q. The SAXS measurement shows the clear pattern of a cubic symmetry. It can be seen that the overall intensity is lower due to the absorption through the liquid.</p><p>Then an ASAXS measurement is performed. Therefore SAXS measurements with an exposure time of 1s are conducted at different beam energies. Five beam energies are chosen below the absorption K-edge of Bromine, which is determined by a XANES measurement as 13.477keV. One SAXS measurement is conducted directly at the edege and two measurements have beam energies above the edge. In total the energy values chosen are:  13227 eV (-250eV below edge(=13.477keV)),  13377 eV (-100 eV),  13427 eV (-50 eV),  13457 eV (-20 eV),  13467 eV (-10 eV),  13477 eV (0 eV),  13497 eV (+20 eV)  13527 eV (+50 eV)</p><p>Through this beam energy dependent set of measurements it should be possible to detect if the bromide-anions are preferentially assembled at the carbon interface. Thus, an energy dependent intensity shift below and above the absorption edge should be detectable, as already shown in literatur.[1,2] However, at the beamtime we were not able to see any energy dependence of the scattering curves. Different spots on the sample where tried as well as higher electrolyte concentrations. Even a high applied potential of 1.2 V, which assembled significantly more anions in the electric double layer on the carbon surface, did not lead to the desired outcome. An ASAXS measurement has also been performed on the absorption edge of the rubidium cation at 15200 eV. A energy dependence of the SAXS intensity could also not be determined.</p><p>ASAXS measurements were meant to monitor the arrangement of bromide anions on the carbon surface during the drying and wetting process of the nanoporous carbon. For the drying process, the relative humidity is set to 65%. Thus, the liquid in the nanoporous carbon that is not in contact with the bulk electrolyte solution evaporates from the pores of the material. But since the sample is still in contact with the bulk electrolyte solution, a capillary force still enables the imbibition of liquid into the sample. Lab studies suggest that the two effects are equilibrating so that a a front within the samples form until which the liquid rises. However, depending on the conditions, i.e. relative humidity, the immersion depth of the sample into the bulk electrolyte solution and the porosity-induced capillary forces, it is also possible that the evaporation leads to so called streaming currents. Thereby, the liquid imbibibes into the whole sample so that it never fully dries.</p><p>During the measurements it was found, that SAXS measurements at one beam energy show a large dependence on the wetting state. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> shows a fully wetted sample where the relative humidity has been successivly reduced to 65%. During the measurement the flow of charge is measured with a potentiostat. Hence, it can be determined how the anions are assembling on the surface. The consecutive SAXS measurments depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> show that the peak position first shifts and then the intensity of both peaks significantly increases while it slightly shifts back. The electron density of the carbon material with respect to the pore filling, either the ambient atmosphere, when the porous material dries, or the eletrolyte solution, changes the scattering and thus the peak intensity. When changing the humidity back to 100%, the trend is reversed, as displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>. However, the last (red) curve is increasing again. This is likely caused by the crystallisation of ions in the pores.</p><p>Overall, the experiment could gather valuable information about the overall drying and wetting behavior. The support by beamline scientist Michael Sztucki was excellent. To improve the experiment an X-ray fluorescence detector would be helpful so that it is possible to determine the concentration of ions at the specific site of the sample in dependence of its overall wetting/drying state. Thus it can be determined if, for example, streaming currents lead to an accumulation of ions. Furthermore, parallel WAXS measurements could monitor if crystallisation occurs. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Drying of Nanoporous Supercapacitors: An Anomalous X-Ray Scattering Study on Liquid and Ion Rearrangement in Michael Sztucki &lt;sztucki@esrf.fr&gt; Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Manuel Brinker, Laura Gallardo-Dominguez, Yannick Tetzner, Lars Damman and Prof. Dr. Patrick Huber; Hamburg University of Technology Benjamin Rudolph and Prof. Dr. Michael Fröba; University of Hamburg Dr. Sujeet Dutta; Institut Lumiere Matiere Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 Dr. Sylvio Haas, Dr. Milena Lippmann; DESY Department of Photon Science</figDesc></figure>
