<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The next generations of nuclear power plant (LWR, HTR, GFR) will use, gradually, on mixed uranium and plutonium oxide as the ceramic fuel, namely MOX (Mixed OXide) of generic formula (U 1y ,Pu y )O 2 . Currently, some nuclear reactors already use this kind of fuel which usually contains 4 to 9 Pu wt%. In UO 2 fuel, the fissile isotope is U 235 which is dispersed homogeneously in the ceramic lattice. In the case of MOX fuel, Pu isotopes are the fissile atoms. To take advantage of the UO 2 fuel acquired experience, Pu should be dispersed as homogeneously as possible in a (U,Pu)O 2 solid solution. Fuel designers and manufacturers are focused on Purich oxide fuel with a fraction of Pu higher than 10 Pu wt% and the improvement of the Pu distribution.</p><p>An optimization of the process conditions could allow us to reach this objective. On the whole, the manufacture of MOX fuel consists in UO 2 and PuO 2 powders cocrushing, milling, pelletizing and sintering. With this method, a fluoritetype solid solution (U,Pu)O 2 might be obtained. The formation of the solid solution, with a Pu ratio between 0 and 100%, is thermodynamically allowed but kinetically slow due to the powder process of milling and to the thermal treatment of sintering.Industrualy, to keep the compacting ability of a pure UO 2 powder, a powder cocrushing of UO 2 PuO 2 with high PuO 2 content is softly mixed with pure UO 2 . Thus, pellets made with this raw materials are constituted of UO 2 and PuO 2 closely mixed aggregates diluted in a majority phase of UO 2 . In order to improve compatibility between fuel, clad and coolant, the MOX is usually made with an O/(U+Pu) ratio of 2.00. To get this stoichiometry, it is necessary to maintain a reducing atmosphere in the sintering furnace with a mixture of ArH 2 H 2 O ( GO Δ 2 between -350 and -500 kJ/mol at 17001750°C). At this oxygen potential, the diffusion coefficients of U and Pu in the (U,Pu)O 2 ceramic are still small. In these conditions, a density close to 95% of the theoretical one can be reached with a grain size sightly smaller than 10 m and the phenomenon of homogenisation are limited, two phases with high and low Pu concentration still μ remaining.</p><p>Although encouraging results were reported for coarsegrained and homogeneous MOX in the case of an oxidizing sintering, this approach has been avoided due to an incompatibility with the current technology of the industrial furnaces. Positive results were obtained for coarsegrained UO 2 by the addition of Nb 2 O 5 , MgO, Al 2 O 3 , V 2 O 5 , TiO 2 or Cr 2 O 3 and for coarsegrained and homogeneous MOX by the addition of TiO 2 , Cr 2 O 3 or UOS. The aim of this study is therefore to examine the impact on the Pu distribution of one of these dopants, i.e. Cr 2 O 3 when it is introduced up to 2000 ppm as a powder during the UO 2 PuO 2 milling. Under the temperature and atmosphere conditions used during sintering, Cr 2 O 3 is particularly interesting because of its property to give rise to a liquid phase (eutectic Cr s +Cr 3 O 4s CrO → l ) which usually helps grain growth. Moreover, the possible presence of Cr 3+ in the fluorine lattice of (U,Pu)O 2 could increase the default concentration and enhance the Pu distribution. A PhD thesis is ongoing to determine the mechanisms of the solid solution formation in presence of chromium.</p><p>However we had to verify the formation of a (U,Pu)O 2 solid solution in the presence of Cr 3+ dopant (introduced under chromium sesquioxide, Cr 2 O 3 , form). EXAFS turned out to be a key technique to probe Pu and U environnements and to evaluate the structural order <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>During our experiment, we analysed samples obtained by the usual powder process the plutonium content of which was equal to 11 wt% (two samples, a and b1) and 27.5 wt% (one sample, b2). For the 11 wt% sample, two ways of synthesis, cocrushing (b1) and micronization of a master blend (a), have been investigated to determine, during sintering, the impact of mixing on the (U,Pu)O 2 microstructure. As it has been shown for the face centred cubic structure (U,Pu)O 2 , the cell parameter of the solid solution obeys a Vegard's law: a (U1y,Puy)O2x = 5,470 0,074y + 0,32x (Å)</p><p>% Pu a (Vegard's law) (Å) First shell MetalO (Å) Second shell MetalMetal (Å) Third shell MetalO (Å) 0 5,4700 2.369 3.868 4.535 11 5.4619 2.365 3.862 4.529 27.5 5.4497 2.360 3.854 4.519 100 5.3960 2.337 3.817 4.475</p><p>For each sample, fluorescence and transmission signals were collected at the uranium (17.126 keV) and plutonium (18.056 keV) L III edges. Energy calibration of XANES data was achieved using the Y foil (17.052 keV) and Zr foil (17.998 keV) references positioned behind the second ionisation chamber. As observed on these XANES spectra, the positions of the white lines are those of the UO 2 at the uranium edge, and those of PuO 2 at the plutonium edge. Thus, whatever the plutonium content is, the oxidation state of uranium and plutonium remains equal to +IV. At the uranium L III edge, EXAFS spectra were collected up to 15 Å 1 but only up to 10.5 Å 1 at the plutonium L III edge. This limitation is due to the presence in the samples of small amount of americium induced by the used plutonium isotopy (americium L III edge: 18.514 keV).</p><p>The evolution of the Fourrier transforms are summarised on the figures 1 and 2. At uranium and plutonium L III edges, best fits were obtained, in each case, after the introduction of an additionnal asymmetry term (third cumulant) to describe the first MetalO shell. For the first three shells, refined distances are in good agreement with those derived from Vegard's law (see table above). This is the signature of the presence of an (U,Pu)O 2 solid solution. Whatever the process and the plutonium content (11% or 27.5%) are, the addition of Cr 3+ dopant during the synthesis is favourable. In comparison with the spectra obtained on wet route solid solution (coprecipitated, without any dopant and at low temperature) [1], the addition of Cr 3+ and the different ways of synthesis show that the structure is better ordered. For the first shell (Metal-O) DebyeWaller factors remain low (0.007 Å 2 ) and far below those measured on wet (U,Pu)O 2 prepared without additive <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>At the end of the allocated beam time, a test at chromiun (5.989 keV) K edge was performed. However, a fluorescence signal of too low intensity was collected. Together with the beamline staff, we are already working on instrumental optimization in order to perform successful measurements at low energies. Indeed, a better knowledge of Cr behaviour (quantity of residual Cr and its chemical environnement) in the fuel would allow us to understand the responsible mechanism for the solide solution development. Beamtime has already been allocated for this project [2].</p><p>[1] : P.Martin, M.Ripert, G.Carlot, S.Grandjean, T.Petit, P. <ref type="bibr">Blanc (2002)</ref> experimental report ME312.
