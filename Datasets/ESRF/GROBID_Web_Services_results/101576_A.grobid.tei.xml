<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background. Manganese (Mn) is both an essential nutrient and a neurotoxic element. While Mn neurotoxicity due to occupational exposures has been known for many years, the developmental neurotoxicity of Mn has only recently begun to be explored. There is growing concern about early life exposure to Mn and developmental neurotoxicity. Mn in drinking water has been associated with lower cognitive performance at all stages of development, including intelligence quotient IQ, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. The mechanisms underlying Mn neurodevelopmental toxicity are still poorly understood but seem to involve glial cells.</p><p>Neuroinflammation has been studied as a key mechanism in Mn neurotoxicity where astrogliosis can play a central role.</p><p>Aim. In this experiment, we have tested the hypothesis that astrocytes can protect against Mn neurotoxicity by decreasing neuronal Mn content. Our samples have consisted in primary rat hippocampal neurons cultured alone, or in co-culture with astrocytes. We have compared Mn concentrations and subcellular distributions in: 1) neurons cultured alone exposed to low levels of Mn; 2) neurons co-cultured with astrocytes exposed to low levels of Mn; 3) neurons cultured alone exposed to high levels of Mn; 4) neurons co-cultured with astrocytes exposed to high levels of Mn.</p><p>Methods. Living cells, neurons and astrocytes, were labelled for Golgi apparatus with Cell-Light Golgi GFP (green fluorescent protein) and with Hoechst 33342 (blue fluorescence) for nucleus localization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). Samples were flash-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot system (FEI). Cryogenic fluorescence microscopy was performed to locate Golgi-apparatus and nucleus in neurons and astrocytes using a Leica cryo-fluorescence microscope recently implemented at the University of Bordeaux. Samples were gently freeze-dried, this method was prefered to fully cryogenic analysis as it greatly facilitated the identification of the cells whith no elemental redistribution at the beam size scale (700 nm). The position of the cells of interest and the morphology was recorded by bright field optical microscopy before XRF imaging at ESRF, on ID21 beamline.</p><p>SXRF Imaging. At the beginning of the experiment we encounterd some difficulties. We started to work at 9.8 keV to image Zn too, an element which homesotasis and quantitative distribution could be altered by Mn exposure, but the photon flux was too reduced at this energy to detect the elemental content in cells. So we decreased the energy of the incoming beam to 7.4 keV to have a higher flux (around 10 times higher). We succesfully imaged Mn in neurons and astrocytes, using a dwell time of 100 ms, and a pixel size of 500 nm and a beam size of 700 nm.</p><p>Result. During this beamtime we could image and quantify neurons and astrocytes exposed for 24h to 0, 250 µM and 500 µM MnCl2. We could analyze a high number of cells, ~12, for each condition. We could clearly identify for the first time in primary hippocampal neurons and astrocytes that Mn was mainly located in the Golgi apparatus in both cell types. For example, in cells exposed to 250 µM MnCl2, Mn accumulates in the Golgi apparatus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref> and D, red arrows), but not only, Mn was also detected in hot-spots along the dendrites (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>, white arrow). Comparing the cryo-fluorescence images and SXRF maps we can conclude that Mn is mainly located in the Golgi apparatus, and present as well along dendrites, suggesting a synaptic localization to be further investigated.</p><p>The AXO standard was used to calibrate the setup and to express element content in ng/mm 2 . Mn quantification will now be performed carefully in each region of interest, to compare Mn content in neurons and astrocytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion.</head><p>The experiment was very successful thanks to ID21 setup. Our first hypothesis was verified experimentally, we could identify the Golgi apparatus as the main site of Mn accumulation in primary hippocampal neurons and astrocytes, for the first time in these cells. This result is of paramount importance to understand the mechanisms of Mn-neurotoxicity, it reveals the Golgi apparatus as a key organelle in Mndetoxification and toxicity. At low Mn exposure, the Golgi apparatus may serve as a detoxification pathway, while at higher exposure, Golgi apparatus functions could be overwhelmed and altered, such as vesicular trafficking, a critical cellular pathway in neurodegeneration, also leading to redistribution of Mn into synaptic compartments, as suggested by the presence of Mn in hotspots along the dendrites. We now need to quantify the data to explore the hypothesis that astrocytes may protect neurons by decreasing Mn content in neurons, and to study potential quantitative changes in other elements (P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe) due to Mn-exposure.</p><p>Perspectives. It would be very interesting to identify whether the Mn hot-spots along dendrites are located within synaptic compartments.</p><p>n Cryo-fluorescence microscopy of Golgi (green) and nucleus (blue) of flash-frozen cells Phosphorous A C D B 10 µm 50 µm Merge P (red) and Mn (green) Manganese</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>.
