S. Konstantin Krausert* Dr. Peter Gaal* Report:</p><p>During the scheduled beamtime the nanosecond grazing incidence pump-probe surface X-ray diffraction experiment has been carried-out at ID03 beamline for the first time.</p><p>During the experiment we have sucessfully prepared the Pt(011) single crystal surface under UHV conditions. Bright (0,3/2,0.01) surface X-ray diffraction peak of 1e7 cts originating form the Pt( <ref type="formula">110</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">1x2</ref>) "missing row" reconstruction has been observed.</p><p>In the initial phase of the experiment we have captured the "single bunch" signal by delaying the Pilatus 300K X-ray detector gate with respect to the ring clock. We have observed a nonuniform gating of the Pilatus photosensitive area that has not been reported before. The results of this part of the experiment are now described in a short communication letter submitted to the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation.</p><p>In the next step of the experiment the "time zero" has been determined by detecting the laser pulses arrival time at the sample position with respect to the ring clock and the detector gate.</p><p>A fast oscilloscope, a photodiode and a delay generator was used to monitor and control the laser emission timing.</p><p>To calibrate the laser excitation power and to identify the time-zero more precisely we have first colleced the transient signal in the vicinity of Pt( <ref type="formula">110</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">022</ref>) Bragg peak in the grazing incidence geometry. It was necessary to use the relatively large "grazing" angle of 2 degrees due to the finite size of the laser beam spot. The time zero has been determined with the accuracy of around 1 nanosecond limited by the laser emission jitter. Using the area X-ray detector we have collected transient X-ray diffraction signal in certan volume of the reciprocal space along the 02L crystal truncation rod in the time range of +-50 ns after the laser excitation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> shows the KL-slice of the reciprocal space through 022 Bragg peak at time zero and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> shows the same region recorded at 25ns after the laser excitation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> shows the signal difference map demonstrating strong transient shift of the CTR signal along L towards negative direction. This is known as the transient thermal expansion effect of the nearsurface crystal lattice due to the impulsive laser pulse heating. The estimated probing depth at this conditions is on the order of 200nm and the peak transient temperature did not exceed 150K. The important new observation is the fact that the CTR signal shifts only along L, without any statisticvally significant effect in the in-plane HK-direction. This effect may be due to the ultrafast nature of the thermal expansion in this experiment and is currently under analysis.</p><p>In the next step of the experiment we have recorded a set of transient CTR signals from the (0 3/2 0) surface Bragg peak. At room temperature and even at elevated up to 300C temperatures the surface peak did not exhibit any statistically significant dynamics on ns timescales. Employing the two facts that the thermal expansion in our experiment results in the peak shifts exclusively along the L-coordinate and that the (0 3/2 0) surface reflection has rod-like structure also along the L-coordinate we concluded that the thermal expansion effect cannot be easily seen from the shifts of the surface diffraction peaks. As the next step we attempted to heat the crystal to the near (1x2)&lt;-&gt;(1x1) phase transition point to promote the surface atom dynamics. Unfortunately, due to the technical failure in the sample heating system we were not able to proceed with sample heating to the HT. The post beamtime investigation showed that we have got a short circuit between the filament and the ground eliminating the possibility of thermoelectron emission heating requried for reaching the order-disorder surface temperatures of 600C.</p><p>The heating stage is now replaced by a new one. Evaluating the first results as "very promising" we are very interested in repeating the experiment. Therefore, we resubmit the original proposal. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a) KL-slice through reciprocal space recorded near 022 Bragg peak at "time zero" and b) recorded at 25ns after the laser excitation, c) their corresponding difference map</figDesc><graphic coords="3,306.60,109.20,277.68,214.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
