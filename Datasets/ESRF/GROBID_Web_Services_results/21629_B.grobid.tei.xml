We recall that these were to study the structural events associated with thin filament activation. These are difficult experiments because the activation occurs in the first few milliseconds after the initiation of the contractile cycle and, moreover, the intermediate states that one wishes to capture are also short-lived. In addition, the reflections associated with these phenomena are not particularly strong. We have collected some preliminary results on the troponin activation phenomenon. These results suggest that it is possible to define/detail the axial changes in the troponin reflections that are associated with activation. This is done by exploiting once again the presence of pronounced interference effects. We also proposed to work on tropomyosin. This has not yet started but we hope to get onto it soon.  </p></div>

The two lines in Fig. 1, that are practically superimposed, illustrate how the shape, therefore the intensity, of the 3M layer line can be reproduced by the appropriate theory. This is essential to obtain the appropriate intensity of the underlying helically diffracting repeating motif (i.e. the thick filament in this case) which combined with the phases can yield interpretable electron density maps. Fig. 2 illustrates how the different intensity dependence on sarcomere length of the important third and sixth myosin layer lines (3M and 6M, respectively) during isometric contraction can satisfactorily be accounted for. The figure shows how this hitherto un-explained dependence on sarcomere length (diamonds) can be accounted for by inclusion of disorder effects in the muscle lattice (open circles). Only after appropriate corrections of this nature are applied it is possible to compare electron density maps describing the myosin heads in different intermediate structural states (see example in 3), at rest the configuration of the two heads is more alike. We have found that the maps during isotonic shortening are essentially identical to those at rest as long as the load is negligible, whilst during stretches they are much like those at Po. Note that the total intensity in the mass projections in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> are identical within error. This testifies for the validity of the procedure for intensity evaluation and correction. The biological significance of these results will be discussed elsewhere (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>conditioning of the specimens. In order to improve the experimental duty cycle, the equipment was modified so that two teams (ourselves and the Hannover team, Dr. T. Kraft and colleagues) could install their physiological apparatus in the hutch. These can be quickly, and reproducibly, moved into the beam whenever one team is ready to carry out their experiments. The result is that, after some initial teething troubles, the duty cycle of the experiments was almost doubled. Overall this works very well. c) The efficiency of data collection has been improved significantly.</p><p>In our line of work the duty cycle is limited by the physiological preparation.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><figDesc>Fig.3). Considering the complexity of the theory it is gratifying that the results can be so accurately accounted for (manuscript in preparation). c) Similar calculations have been applied to the data collected at rest, during shortening and stretches. The combination of phase extraction and intensity determination has yielded a number of electron density maps that can be quantitatively compared. This is illustrated in Fig.3where electron density maps, corresponding to the mass projection at Po (isometric plateau) and at rest, are shown. The two lobes of density represent the mass projection of a pair of myosin heads in the unit cell, therefore one can conclude that whilst at Po (fully developed tension during isometric contraction) one head in the pair adopts a more perpendicular orientation to the muscle axis (ref.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><figDesc>have developed experimental and theoretical methods to obtain phase information for the meridional reflections (i.e. those that contain the information about the axial configuration of the myosin heads) from the interference phenomena present in the X-ray patterns(refs. 3,4). These measurements have now been extended to the recording of diffraction diagrams from muscles undergoing various forms of contraction, e.g. unloaded shortening, shortening under various loads, as well as under controlled stretches. The relevant phase information has been obtained, albeit at a relatively low resolution of ca. 5.0 nm. This is because the size of the detectors available is not large enough to cover the reciprocal space range needed to extend the data to high resolution and at the same time resolve the interference effects. Until more suitable detectors come along, this part of the work must be regarded as complete. b) On the other hand, we have found that in order to compare the conformation of the myosin heads in the various forms of contraction it is also necessary to include fairly sophisticated intensity corrections. These are essential to obtain electron density maps that can be quantitatively compared with each other.The reason for this is that the muscle diffraction patterns are susceptible to crystallographic disorder effects, which are strongly influenced by the exact contracting condition of the muscle (i.e. resting, isometric or isotonic). To solve this problem we have developed what seems to be a sound/rigorous theoretical approach. The application of these theoretical corrections requires time resolved data in which the peak shapes are very accurately determined. This accuracy can only be achieved with the beam profile only available from a third generation X-ray source such as the ESRF. The combined experimental/theoretical work has allowed us to extract the necessary corrections for a number of contracting states. The attached figures illustrate the procedure. TheReport:The conditions of a Long Term Project (LTP) are that: in addition to tackling a scientific program of value, the participants must engage in the development of methods and/or instrumentation that could be, in due course, of benefit to the ESRF user community, and; to improve the efficiency in the use of the ESRF. Therefore, this report is in two parts: the first refers to what we have been doing about the technical aspects of our use of the ESRF, and; the second is concerned with progress in muscle research.Technical/instrumentation aspects: a) In order to explore the possibility to install easily accessible detectors of different kinds to those normally available (such as the RAPID detector on loan from the SRS, Daresbury), a by-pass of the large evacuated chamber in ID2 was installed by ESRF staff and tried out. This was done by installing horizontally diffracting monochromator crystals, so that the X-ray beam could be diverted to one side and by-pass the large evacuated chamber. The measurements clearly indicated that an unacceptable loss of useful intensity was suffered. This was due to the fact that the rocking curve width of the crystals in use was too narrow relative to the horizontal beam divergence. The solution to this problem is to replace the current crystals with asymmetrically cut ones as this would broaden their input angular acceptance. Hopefully this will be tried out sometime in the future. b) In terms of developing equipment of general interest, one should mention that we are in the final stages of signing a protocol of collaboration with the ESRF. The aim is to construct and, in due course exploit, single photon counting position sensitive devices with the specific aim of enabling the pursuit of time resolved experiments. This should result in the technical possibility to carry out true kinetic experiments with time resolutions in the sub-millisecond domain. This is something that currently is not possible at the ESRF. In parallel other work in progress (refs. 1,2), we have additionally committed ca. 3 work-years/year and in excess of ca. 120,000 euros to this collaboration.</figDesc></figure>
