<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Magnetic and electronic excitations probed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in Sr2IrO4/SrTiO3 superlattices Experiment number: HC-5312 Beamline: ID 20 Date of experiment: from: 27/06/2023 to: 03/07/2023 Date of report: 18/09/2023 Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): Christoph Sahle Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Xin Liu, Paul Scherrer Institut SwissFEL Bernina group Roman Mankowsky, Paul Scherrer Institut SwissFEL Bernina group Henrik Till Lemke, Paul Scherrer Institut SwissFEL Bernina group Report:</p><p>With the assistance of laser-molecular beam epitaxy (L-MBE), we have fabricated series of high quality Sr2IrO4 thin film and [(Sr2IrO4)m/(SrTiO3)n] (Im/Tn) (m,n) = (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (6,12) superlattices. In the superlattices with inversion symmetry broken, an interesting magnetoelectric phase transition was observed. Both electronic and magnetic properties can be tuned (reduced band gap and magnetic transition temperature) by controlling the thickness of each layer, but the microscopic origin is not well understood.</p><p>Our purpose of the proposal with the experimental number of HC-5312 is to carry out the hard-RXIS on Ir-edge at ID 20 beamline to obtain the spin-orbit, magnetic and electron-hole pairs excitations, which can help to reveal the microscopic physics of the observed phenomena of tuneable magnetism and band gap, and further understand what kind of the role of the symmetry broken and charge transfer effect play in this system.</p><p>We have used the standard setup at ID 20 beamline for hard-RXIS measurement to detect the q dependent spectra at 10 K by using the cryostat at the beamline of ESRF. The energy is at the Ir L3-edge of 11.215 keV with the energy resolution of ~28 meV. Four samples of (Sr2IrO4)1/(SrTiO3)2, (Sr2IrO4)1.5/(SrTiO3)3, (Sr2IrO4)3/(SrTiO3)6 and (Sr2IrO4)3/(BaTiO3)6were measured in total. In order to obtain the dispersion, we measured different 18 qpoints for each sample.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, we plot one of the samples' q dependent measurements. Based on the results, magnetic and spin-orbit excitations were obtained for all the samples. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>, the magnon dispersion demonstrates the controllable magnon by controlling the polarization in the sample (the thicker of SrTiO3 layer, the larger of the polarization), revealing the microscopic mechanism of tuneable magnetism.</p><p>The electron-hole pairs excitation can only be observed by soft-RIXS at the O K-edge, therefore, in order to further understand the reduced band gap in the superlattices, we are going to submit a proposal to apply the beamtime in ID 32 with the experimental number of HC-5639.
