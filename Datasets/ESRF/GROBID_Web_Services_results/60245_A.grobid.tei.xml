<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aim of the experiment was to determine if the misfit (MS) dislocation network present at the interface between a thin film of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-x (BZY) grown onto the (110) surface of NdGaO3 (NGO) substrate was sensitive to proton loading.</p><p>This substrate is normally chosen for the growth of perovskites because of its stability. The (110) face is the one showing the standard cubic perovskite structure with a lattice constant of 3.91Å.</p><p>Four samples have been analised during the experiment differing mainly in thickness of the BZY film in the range from 6 to 100 nm. For the experiment we used the flow reactor in order to control the gas environment of the samples from humid atmosphere (Ar saturated with water at 1 bar) to O2 treatment (300 mbar) and CO (at 200 mbar). In the first sample Gas exposure was carried out at 450°, 480° and 500°C while on the other samples the exposure was carried out only at 480°C.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> we show a typical intensity 2D map from such systems measured at L=0.15 rlu in the UHV chamber of the ID03 beamline. As reference system we used the square approximant surface unit cell of the NdGaO3 (110) surface. In the map several families of peaks are visible. The ones at H and K integers and H half integers are truncation rods of the substrate. The peaks at H and K multiple of 0.92 rlu are peaks from the BZY film. The other small peaks at H and K = n ± m*.08, with n and m integers (in the case of H, n also half integer) are due to the MF dislocation network.</p><p>Experiment title: Structural study of the Yttrium-Doped Barium Zirconate thin films interface upon insertion of protons. Experiment number: MA-3069 Beamline: ID03 Date of experiment: from:29 Nov 2016 to:</p><p>The rings are due to some residual of silver print paint we used to perform impedance spectroscopy measurements. 0 100000 200000 300000 400000 0 100000 200000 intensity 1,8 1,9 2,0 0 50000 100000 150000 H Figure 2) X-ray intensity plot along the dashed line of fig. 1.</p><p>The diffraction peaks of the BZY film and NGO substrate are the ones at ~1.835 rlu and ~2.0 while the MD peak is at about 1.92 rlu. On the top is the intensity plot of the pristine film, in the centre after exposure at a humid atmpsphere for 4 hours at 450 °C and in the bottom after annealing at 450° in a dry environment. From the above plots it results that the intensity of the MD peak depends strongly on the exposing atmosphere highlighting the role of the MD in the protonization of the interface.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> we show an intensity plot along the dashed line of fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> at H=0 and K in the range 1.75-2.05 rlu. The plot includes intensity from the BZY film, the substrate (2,0,0.15) CTR and the dislocation network at (1.92, 0, 0.15). The other small maxima present in the plot and indicated with arrows are are due to the Be dome of the flow reactor.</p><p>Here we only report the data for the 6nm film. Similar results have been obtained for the 20 nm films.</p><p>In the two other thicker samples (50 and 100 nm) we have studied the MD peak was not visible.</p><p>The beamline worked fine and we have been able to answer to most of the questions listed in the proposal. We plan to submit a new proposal to better understand the loading dynamics of this class of systems and to better determine the stability upon cycling. These two last questions resulted from the results of this experiment.</p><p>The support from the ID03 staff was of very high quality.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 )Figure 2 )</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1) X-ray intensity map collected at L=0.15 rlu from a 6 nm thick film of BaZr0.8Y0.203-y film grown on the pseudo cubic (110) surface of NdGaO3.
