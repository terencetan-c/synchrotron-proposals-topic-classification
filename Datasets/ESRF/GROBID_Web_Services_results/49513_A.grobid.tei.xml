<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Scorodite occurs often as a secondary mineral in oxidized waste rocks and mine tailings rich in arsenopyrite. Considered the least soluble arsenate phase in many mine tailing systems and with a low dissolution rate, scorodite remains at mine waste sites after many years of weathering in natural conditions. However, under strongly acid conditions scorodite congruently dissolves, releasing equimolar concentrations of As and Fe, while at higher pH, it does incongruently, forming ferrihydrite and arsenate. Arsenic adsorption on ferrihydrite resulted from incongruent dissolution of scorodite has been proposed in the literature as the controlling factor in the solubility and subsequent release of As to the media. In spite of it, little is known about As mobilization associated to the nano-ferrihydrite, precipitated after scorodite dissolution in mine waste. Because of the colloidal size of this ferrihydrite, we hypothesize that ferrihydrite could act as As carrier and, therefore, increases As mobility and contamination of surface or subsurface water bodies. Most of the studies about natural colloids and their role as carriers of toxic elements are based on microscopic techniques and thus, no conclusive information about the chemical mechanism between the contaminant and the colloidal particles could be address. Additional research at a molecular scale is needed to evaluate the stability of these interactions and assess the environmental risk associated to them. As a fundamental step within the research project CGL2010-17434 financed by the Spanish National Research Plan, our experiment aimed to study scorodite dissolution at different pH conditions to characterize the dissolution products and determine the stability of the As-Fe particles interactions at a molecular scale, information that is key to predict the potential environmental impact of these As-colloid associations</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental methods</head><p>All our experiments were performed using a scorodite-rich waste material (waste pile -WP) dumped outside in an abandoned smelting factory located in Guadalix de la Sierra (Community of Madrid, Spain), in which arsenopyrite encapsulated in quartz was processed for wolfram extraction during the Second World War. Dissolution experiments at different pH conditions <ref type="bibr">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7)</ref> and reaction times <ref type="bibr">(6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 hours and 7, 15, 30 days)</ref> were performed using batch technique with this scorodite-rich waste materials at 1:10 solid:solution ratio. Samples of the colloid fraction released after the dissolution experiments were isolated on the basis of a centrifugation protocol already tested from previous experiments (see CRG_25_01_817) aiming to separate particle size fractions larger than the target size (&lt; 1µm). The dissolved fraction (&lt;10 nm) was obtained by ultrafiltration of the &lt;1 µm fraction through a ultrafiltration membrane. The ultrafiltration membranes were removed from the holders and colloids measured by XAS. Colloidal suspensions were also placed on Ni grids for subsequent Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples and spectra collected</head><p>During our experiment, As and Fe k-edge EXAFS spectra of three colloid samples isolated from the the scorodite-rich waste suspensions obtained after the following experimental conditions, pH 3 and 7 days, pH 6 and 7 days, and pH 6 and 6 hours, were measured on bending-magnet BM25A beamline (SpLine) (6 GeV, 100 mA, Si(111) monochromator crystals) in fluorescence mode using a 13-element Si(Li) solid state detector with the sample at room temperature. A total of 72 As/Fe spectra (12 scans per colloid sample and element) are currently being analized using the computer packages ATHENA (Ravel and Newville, 2005) for linear combination fits. Background was subtracted using a linear fit through the pre-edge region and the Autobak routine in Athena for the spline fit through the EXAFS region. Arsenic XANES spectra were fit by linear least-squares combination fits of reference compounds to verify the As oxidation state. In addition to the colloid samples, preliminary Fe XANES spectra of six bulk sediment samples collected in an area next to the waste pile were measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Preliminary As and Fe XAS analysis of the colloid fraction after isolation of the colloids on ultrafiltration membranes indicated only partial dissolution of Scorodite (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), compare to the untreated WP sample and the scorodite spectra.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> As can be seen in Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>, XAS spectra of the colloidal fractions showed scorodite and As sorbed on ferrihydrate in different proportions as the main components in the colloid samples. Chemical analysis of the colloid suspensions showed lower As and higher Fe concentration at pH 3 than at pH 6. These results indicate higher scorodite dissolution at pH 6 than at pH 3 and ferrihydrite precipitation at pH 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Colloidal scorodite, present in a waste pile situated in an abandoned smelting factory, partially dissolves depending on pH and agitation time. Higher dissolution occurs a pH 6 than a pH 3, indicating higher scorodite stability at acidic pH than at neutral ones. This is an important information for the remediation of the site and the preservation of the surrounding area from As contamination. In addition, XAS preliminary analyses showed the presence of scorodite and As sorbed in ferrihydrite as the main components of the colloid samples. Higher proportion of ferrihydrite was found at pH 6 corroborating the precipitation of this mineral and its potential role as an As carrier. Further studies will investigate stability and transport processes of colloidal particles within the project CGL2010-17434 supported by the Spanish National Research Plan.</p><p>Total results are in preparation as: M.A. Gómez-González, S.Serrano, F. Laborda, E. Bolea and F.Garrido. Disolution of colloidal Scorodite as a funtion of pH and reaction time: role of ferrihydrite as As carrier. In preparation</p></div>		</body>
