<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Studying the corrosion of U metal by hydrogen absorption using epitaxial films </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments are aimed at studying the earliest stages (induction period) of the uranium hydrogen reaction; a corrosion process that is known to be very aggressive. In this experiment we have examined a number of samples made from thin films (some of them epitaxial) containing U in different orientations to determine whether this method gives complementary information to that obtained by using bulk samples.</p><p>In each case we exposed the samples to a commercial supply of 4%H 2 /Ar at various partial pressures for various times. The samples were heated to 80 C for most of the exposures, but final heating was to 200 C. We had some difficulties with the apparatus delivering and measuring precise doses of H 2 /Ar, and have determined how to improve this with some new parts made at AWE and Bristol.</p><p>The samples were mostly epitaxial films of between 30 and 60 nm of uranium deposited on either Nb or W buffer layers of ~ 10 nm grown on sapphire substrates. This procedure is known to produce strongly ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and (001) textured uranium, respectively <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The UO 2 was deposited on top of the uranium either in the sputtering machine in Bristol during growth or was allowed to develop naturally by exposing the uranium to air. The UO 2 films are about 30 nm thick and do not grow epitaxially on U metal, but show strong (111) texture. One sample with uranium grown on glass was examined, but the reflectivity and diffraction measurements were of insufficient quality.</p><p>Following the procedure used for bulk samples, the samples were pre-heated to 200 C to activate the samples. In retrospect this heating may have damaged the epitaxy of some of the films, and we need to investigate this further.</p><p>Using X-rays of λ = 1.55 Å, reflectivity (from 0.2 to 6 o ) and high-angle diffraction (from 23 to 42 o ) were measured in each case. The reflectivity is dominated by the thin buffer layers of Nb and W and we need to investigate what happens as a function of heating these more carefully.</p><p>A typical diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> below. In this sample the predominant peak is from the U( <ref type="formula">110</ref>), but about 10% of the sample has a (001) orientation. On exposure to H 2 /Ar the most dramatic effect is the loss of intensity of the U(110) diffraction peak. This reduces by a factor of 100 over 100 minutes at 140 C. The peak shift also shows that the (110) d-space is expanding during hydrogen exposure. On the other hand, the U(002) diffraction peak reduces only by a factor of 2 under the same conditions. The UO 2 surface film (in this case air grown) is slightly reduced in intensity through hydrogen exposure, and the higher oxides are totally reduced, as expected. Unexpectedly, there are no diffraction signals consistent with UH 3 : the expected polymorph, β-UH 3 , exhibits its strongest diffraction signal at 30.24 o in 2θ.</p><p>The large difference between the ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">001</ref>) planes with respect to hydrogen diffusion may be understood qualitatively by showing the projections of these planes for the uranium atoms, as below. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The consumption of uranium can easily be observed using these samples and has shown unexpected variances in the rates at which metal faces are consumed. The lack of detection of UH 3 is puzzling, since uranium is being significantly consumed, and related experiments on bulk samples clearly showed β-UH 3 . It may be that the UH 3 is formed as either amorphous and/or nano-crystalline precipitates in this system. We anticipate that further improvements in our ability to model the reflectivity data will shed light on this aspect of the reaction.</p><p>The improvements we anticipate are: a) Improved ability to repeatedly dose H 2 /Ar aliquots on to the sample b) Extensive characterisation of the samples prior to exposure to improve understanding of the reflectivity c) Improved understanding of how the buffer layers may change with either heat treatments or hydrogen exposures to remove this uncertainty from the reflectivity model. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): R.
