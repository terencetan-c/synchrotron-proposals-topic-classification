The XANES spectra of the reduced samples are characterised by an absorption edge crest at 2476.4 eV, typical of S 2-(see Figure <ref type="figure">below</ref>). In addition, spectra of Fe-bearing compositions exhibit a pronounced absorption edge shoulder. Spectra for all the Fe-free samples are essentially identical, as are the spectra for the Fe-bearing compositions, despite significant compositional variability within each group. The presence of a sulfide phase, such as might exsolve on cooling, can be inferred from a pre-edge feature at 2470.5 eV. ) has negligible solubility in silicate melts at low pressures (see Figure <ref type="figure">below</ref>). The previous identification of sulfite species in natural glass samples is attributed to an artifact of the analysis (photoreduction of S 6+ ). S 4+ does, however, occur unambiguously with S 6+ in Fe-free and Fe-poor compositions prepared in equilibrium with CaSO 4 at 4-16 kbar, and when buffered with Re/ReO 2 at 10 kbar. Solubility of S 4+ thus requires partial pressures of SO 2 considerably in excess of 1 bar. A number of experiments were undertaken in an attempt to access intermediate fO 2 s more applicable to terrestrial volcanism. Although these were largely unsuccessful, S 2-and S 6+ were found to coexist (see Figure <ref type="figure">below</ref>) in some samples that were not in equilibrium with the imposed fO 2 .</p><p>The XANES spectra of natural olivine-hosted melt inclusions and submarine glasses representative of basalts at, or close to, sulfide saturation show mainly dissolved S 2-, but with minor sulfate, and additionally a peak at 2469.5 eV, which, although presumably due to immiscible sulfide, is 1 eV lower than that typical of FeS. The sulfate-related peak and the FeS(?)-related peak disappear with homogenization of the inclusions by heating to 1200 °C followed by rapid quenching, suggesting that both these features are a result of cooling under natural conditions. The presence of small amounts of sulfate in otherwise reduced basaltic magmas may be explained by the electron exchange reaction: S 2-+ 8Fe 3+ = S 6+ + 8Fe 2+ , which is expected to proceed strongly to the right with decreasing temperature. This reaction would explain why S 2-and S 6+ are frequently found together despite the very limited fO 2 range over which they are thermodynamically predicted to coexist. The S XANES spectra of water-rich, highly oxidised, basaltic inclusions hosted in olivine from Etna and Stromboli confirm that nearly all S is dissolved as sulfate, explaining their relatively high S contents.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The XANES spectra of the oxidised samples are characterised by an intense transition at 2482.1 eV, typical of the sulfate anion SO 4</figDesc></figure>
