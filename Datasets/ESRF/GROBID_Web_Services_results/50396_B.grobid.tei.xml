<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our goal was to study the mechanical properties of individual nanostructures and the influence of size effects using coherent X-ray diffraction. For this purpose, we randomly dispersed Cu nanowires grown along the &lt;110&gt; direction on a Si substrate and we plastically deformed them ex situ to different strain states. The wires themselves were located by recording the Cu-K α fluorescence signal. The alignment of the wires in Bragg conditions is hampered due to their radial symmetry. However, µLaue diffraction studies performed prior to this experiment at the BM32 beamline gave direct access to the wire orientation with respect to the Si surface facilitating their alignment. The focused X-ray beam was scanned along the nanowires and 3D reciprocal space maps were recorded at several different positions revealing the structural changes within the wire.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</head><p>The nanowires were visually located by means of the optical microscope at the ID01 beamline. During the experiment coherent 3D reciprocal space maps were recorded at several points along plastically deformed single nanowires with a diameter of 200 nm. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a</ref>  After locating a Cu nanowire, the evolution of the Cu(111) Bragg reflection along the nanowire was investigated. To maintain the nanowire in Bragg condition the incident rocking angle had to be changed by about 4° on a legnth of ~15 µm indicating a distorsion of the wire. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> presents a scanning electron micrograph of the Cu nanowire and scanning X-ray diffraction maps for various incident rocking angles showing the evolution of the Cu(111) Bragg peak along the wire. These results agree with findings from previous µLaue diffraction studies.   For studying single wires the coherent X-ray beam at ID01 was focused down to 300 x 600 nm 2 employing a Fresnel zone plate. Thanks to the fluorescence detector and the MAXIPIX detector present at the beamline the Cu-K a radiation and the diffraction signal of the wires were recorded simultaneously allowing for locating the different nanowires unambiguously while translating the sample through the beam. The acquisition of 3D RSMs give access to defects present in the nanowires.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>) and (b) present scanning electron microscopy images of a nanowire with a diameter of 200 nm before and after mechanical deformation. In Fig.1(c) the Si(004) diffraction intensity and the simultaneously recorded Cu-K α fluorescence signal are displayed revealing the microtrenches on the Si wafer surface prepared by lithography and the deformed Cu nanowire. This approach of simultaneous acquisition of diffraction and fluorescence signal demonstrates the unambiguous detection of individual nanowires.</figDesc></figure>
