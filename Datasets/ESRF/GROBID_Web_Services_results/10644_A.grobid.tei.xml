<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>5HSRUW Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and posttranslationally imported into mitochondria depending on the hydrolisys of cytoplasmic ATP, the electrochemical potential across the inner membrane, and ATP in the matrix, although the latter two are additionally required for the precursors crossing the inner membrane. Proteins produced by the free ribosomes usually process N-terminal target signal peptides which are recognized by cytosolic factors and brought to various destinations such as mitochondria or nucleus. Elucidation of detailed mechanisms of the signal peptide recognition by the cytosolic factors and the targeting of the carrier to the correct organelles will advance the understanding of protein transport in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>A cytosolic factor (MSF, mitochondrial import stimulation factor) stimulates precursor import into mitochondria. MSF is a heterodimer of large (32 kDa) and small (29 kDa) subunits that unfolds the aggregated, import-incompetent precursors with the dissipation of ATP and binds to the unfolded precursors to stabilize their import-competent states. Thus, MSF seems to possess the properties of a so-called molecular chaperone. Mechanisms of the signal recognition and how MSF binding is related to its role in this process be revealed by studying the three dimensional structure of the MSF and its complex with signal peptide.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>([SHULPHQWDO PHWKRG</head><p>We have obtained crystals of native MSF small subunit under the following conditions:protein concentration 20mg/ml, in 50mM Tris-HCl, 2.8M ammonium sulfate, pH7.5 at 25 Û&amp; &amp;OHDU WKLQ FU\VWDOV [ [ PP ZHUH REWDLQHG ;UD\ H[SHULPHQWV of crystals were carried out at ID14 EH3. Frozen crystals by cryogenic stream with anti-cryo solution were used during X-ray exposure. Total 28 crystals were used for X-ray experiments. Three crystals among them gave diffraction up to 5Å. Data acquisition condition was shown bellow: wavelength 0.933 Å, camera length 300 mm, MAR CCD detector, oscillation angle 1 Û H[SRVXUH WLPH VHF 7RWDO GLIIUDFWLRQ IUDPHV ZHUH recorded from three crystals, and processed by the program MOSFLM on the NICE ESRF computing system. Crystallographic cell dimensions and space group are a=70.52Å, b= 210.64Å, c=123.14Å, β=91.13Û 31. MSF functions as a large and small subunit heterodimer in the cell, however, our MSF crystals are composed of MSF small subunits,therefore it is considered as a homo-dimer. Assumed the Vm value is 2.5 Å 3 /Da, six MSF dimers are packing in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement method was used for the determination of phases of this diffraction data with the program AMORE on the NICE system. The amino acid sequence of the MSF is identical to that of 14-3-3 zeta protein.</p><p>Cross rotation function with a dimer starting model was calculated using 6 Å resolution data and reasonably gave twelve and more solutions. Translational function was calculated by using and adding the solution of the rotation function. A consistent solution among some results of translational functions was obtained. However, the solution could not give a wellinterpretative electron density map about the MSF dimer molecule in the asymmetric unit. A further calculation and crystallization of complex with signal peptide are now in progress.</p></div>		</body>
