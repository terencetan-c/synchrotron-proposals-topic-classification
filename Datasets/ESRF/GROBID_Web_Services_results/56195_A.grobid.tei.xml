<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>EXAFS spectra were acquired for indium and germanium salts dissolved in either sulphuric acid, MSA or hydrochloric acid at varying pH (0 -3) and chloride content. Spectra of solid indium chloride and germanium powder were obtained for reference purposes.</p><p>The fluorescence data quality for the germanium samples was excellent, even down to a concentration of 1 mM. Transmission data for the indium data was generally good, except for samples of &lt; 10 mM, at which point it was necessary to switch to fluorescence mode. Fluorescence data for the indium samples exhibited high noise levels, even with multiple scans and extended data acquisition times. The same fluorescence detector (13-element Si(Li) detector) was used for both edges.</p><p>Liquid samples were measured in both transmission and fluorescence mode, with the solid samples being measured in transmission mode and diluted in a cellulose matrix. Precipitation was observed in some of the indium samples with higher pH and these were filtered prior to the experiment. However this does not seem to have unduly affected the data quality. Solubility of the germanium salt was low in all solvents, however sufficient sample had dissolved in order to be measurable via EXAFS.</p><p>Metal-ligand distances were calculated to be around 1.75 Å for Ge-O, 2.0 to 2.2 Å for In-O and around 2.4 Å for In-Cl, which is consistent with both the solid reference samples and previous experimental data. Generally, as the amount of chloride in the bulk sulphuric acid samples was increased via addition of NaCl, a corresponding change in the speciation was observed, up to a maximum of 4xCl per In atomthe same speciation as that of indium chloride in 1 M hydrochloric acid. The pH of the sample did not have an obvious effect on the speciation of the sample. This suggests that any changes seen in our electrochemical experiments are due to changes in speciation due to chloride ligands and not hydrolytic effects. Changes in EXAFS speciation coincides with changes in the UV-vis spectroscopic results and this may help us to analyse solution using laboratory techniques in the future.</p><p>For all the germanium samples, a 4xO coordination was calculated. This did not vary, even in hydrochloric acid. A signal at approx. 3 Å in the FT was observed and could be fitted using a multiple scattering model of tetrahedrally coordinated germanium with oxygen-donor ligands.</p><p>For the indium samples in sulphuric acid or MSA, two peaks were observed, the first of which could be fitted to 6xO coordination. The second peak is anticipated to be a mixture of secondary hydration shells and signal from the S-atom in the sulphate/MSA ligand. At this time, we cannot resolve the exact composition of this peak due to the overlapping signals, however any S-coordination contributions are expected to be quite low due to it generally being a weakly coordinating ligand in these solutions.</p><p>Indium samples in chloride-containing media displayed a broader first peak which could be fitted to a mixture of Cl and O ligands. After a ratio of 5 chlorides per indium, the fit converged for 4xCl and 2xO ligands.</p><p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 FT k 2 (k) r / Å 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 FT k 2 (k) r / Å 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 FT k 2 (k) r / Å</p><p>Fourier transforms of the EXAFS data (black circles) and fits (red line) for In 2 (SO 4 ) 3 in H 2 SO 4 (left), InCl 3 in HCl (middle) and GeO 2 in H 2 SO 4 (right).</p><p>These results have allowed us to understand the connection between anion concentration an speciation of the target elements. Results correlate with electrochemical and UV-Vis spectroscopic experiments. pH had no significant effect on speciation up to pH3, at which point hydrolysis of In(III) and precipitation takes place.</p></div>		</body>
