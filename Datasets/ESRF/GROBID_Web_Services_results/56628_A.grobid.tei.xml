<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nanowires (NWs) combining a semiconductor and a ferromagnet in a core/shell geometry allow for a magnetization along the wire and thus perpendicular to the substrate surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Fe 3 Si is lattice matched to GaAs. However, the difference of the surface energies of both materials leads to the strain-free Volmer-Weber island growth mode of Fe 3 Si on GaAs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> Thus the initially isolated Fe 3 Si islands can grow to their equilibrium shape before coalescence. The GaAs cores are facetted as hexagonal pillars. The Fe 3 Si shells are not obliged to replicate the {110} oriented sidewalls of the cores, and indeed we find growth conditions, where they do not. MBE grown GaAs/Fe 3 Si core/shell NW structures on Si(111) were characterized by SEM, X-ray diffraction, and TEM. The X-ray experiments were performed in grazing incidence geometry (cf. sketch in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) at the beamline BM 02 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble. The energy of the beam was 10 keV. The detector size is 560×120 pixels of size 130×130µm 2 each. In order to minimize the penetration depth into the substrate and the film between the NWs we took a very small angle of incidence of 0.04°. In this way the signal of the ensemble of NWs was always dominating the diffraction pattern. This was checked by observation of the vanishing signal of the single-crystal Si substrate, which would dominate the diffraction curve at larger angles of incidence. TEM images and selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns are acquired with a JEOL 3010 microscope operating at 300 kV. The cross-section TEM methods provide high lateral and depth resolutions on the nanometer scale, however they average over the projected thickness of the NW. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an SEM micrograph of the GaAs/Fe 3 Si core/shell NWs. A relatively low area density of well oriented NWs  NW = 5x10 8 cm -2 is found as well as some hillocks. Regular step patterns are clearly visible on the sidewalls of the NWs. A poly-crystalline film covers the substrate surface between the NWs. The geometry of XRD in grazing incidence geometry is sketched on top of the micrograph. K i , K f , and K d are the wave-vectors of the incident, reflected, and diffracted beams, respectively. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> depicts the XRD curves of the (-220) reflection of GaAs/Fe 3 Si core/shell NWs. The shells were grown at a temperature of 200°C. A radial 2 scan (thick red line) along the [-110] direction and an angular -scan perpendicular to the [-110] direction (thin black line), together with their full widths at half maximum (FWHM) are given. The FWHM of the diffraction peak amounts to 0.55° in the angular direction, whereas the FWHM in the radial direction 0.08° is lower by more nearly a factor of seven. The FWHM in angular direction here corresponds to the range of twist of the NWs, as in-plane reflections are used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> The range of tilt of GaAs NWs was measured earlier to be near 0.28° using symmetrical out-of-plane measurements. The radial scan shows thickness fringes (marked by arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) corresponding to a thickness of 14.3 nm equal to the Fe 3 Si shell thickness. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> demonstrates in-plane reciprocal space maps of the (-220)-reflection of GaAs NWs (left) and GaAs/Fe 3 Si core/shell NWs (center and right). The growth temperatures of the Fe 3 Si shells were 200°C (center) and 300°C (right). The crystallographic directions are sketched below. The facets of the pillar shaped cores with hexagonal cross-section are clearly distinguished by streaks in the diffuse scattering pointing along the &lt;110&gt; directions. In the central map core streaks along the &lt;110&gt; directions are still visible although they are superimposed by additional streaks along the &lt;1-21&gt; directions originating from the tilted {1-11} facets of the Fe 3 Si shells. In the map shown on the right side only streaks of the shell facets remain. Additional maxima above the main peak indicate interface reactions between Fe 3 Si and GaAs occurring at T S = 300°C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> demonstrates a multi-beam bright-field TEM micrograph and the corresponding SAD pattern illustrating the orientational relationship of a GaAs/Fe 3 Si core/shell NW. We observe the coincidence of the core-and shell-orientations, i.e. here the Fe 3 Si growth is predominantly epitaxial on the GaAs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The straight line drawn on the SAD pattern near the (11-1) reflection is oriented perpendicular to the nanofacets of Fe 3 Si visible in the corresponding micrograph. The separation of the diffraction spots along this line corresponds to the (111) net plane distance of Fe 3 Si indicating that the nanofacets are mainly {111}-oriented. For the SAD the substrate was first oriented near the [011] zone axis. Then the NW had to be tilted a little further in order to keep the [011] zone axis orientation of the GaAs NW, because the axis of the NW was not exactly perpendicular to the Si surface. In the SAD pattern from a single core/shell NW the Fe 3 Si maxima are stronger probably due to larger volume fraction of the shell. The fundamental reflections of the Fe 3 Si are more intense than the super-lattice maxima. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Nevertheless we can distinguish higher order maxima evidencing, that the NW is properly oriented and that the crystallographic orientations of core and shell basically coincide. This underlines that a growth temperature of 200°C is well suited with respect to reach a highly perfect strain-free structure of the Fe 3 Si shells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of {111} facets reduces the overall surface energy of the shells. Consequently a non negligible material transport occurs over distances small compared to the NW lengths. We thank the ESRF in Grenoble for providing beamtime during the experiment HC-1967. This work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research through the Naval Research Laboratory's Basic Research Program. Some computations were performed at the DoD Major Shared Resource Center at AFRL.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SEM image of GaAs/Fe3Si core/shell NWs and islands grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a Si(111) substrate at a substrate temperature of TS = 200°C.
