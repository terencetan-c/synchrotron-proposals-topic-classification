<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Conventional radiography and tomography are very successful non-destructive methods to look inside rather thick samples simply by detecting the attenuation of x-rays with a spatially resolving detector. However, a number of interesting samples are very difficult to image with sufficient contrast. For example the detection of tumours in soft tissue is very difficult with x-rays as the difference in absorption between healthy tissue and a tumour is extremely small. A look at the x-ray refractive index shows, that even in such cases the difference in phase shift is usually considerable. Thus a variety of x-ray phase contrast imaging methods have been developed to improve the contrast of low absorbing samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>We have recently developed an interferometric x-ray imaging technique based on diffraction gratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>The method is capable of detecting wavefront distortions of an incident wave caused by the phase shift gradients of a sample in a quantitative way and with extreme sensitivity. The set-up is very simple, robust, easy to align, and can be scaled up to large fields of view. These properties make the method very interesting for medical applications. The interferometer used in the experiement MI-764 consisted of a phase grating G1 (i.e., a grating whose lines show negligible absorption but substantial phase shift) and an amplitude analyzer grating G2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>The first grating acts as a beam splitter and divides the incoming beam essentially into the two first diffraction orders, which form a periodic interference pattern in the plane of the analyzer grating. Neither the period nor the lateral position of these fringes depends on the wavelength of the radiation used. Perturbations of the incident wave front induced by refraction on an object in the beam, lead to local displacements of the fringes. The analyzer grating acts as a transmission mask for the detector and transforms local fringe position into signal intensity variation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The detected signal profile thus contains quantitative information about the phase gradient of the object. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows scanning electron micrographs of cross sections through the gratings used. The height of the 4 µm period phase grating was chosen to give π phase shift for 17.8 keV radiation. The height of the gold absorbers in the analyzer grating is 12 µm, which results in a transmission of less than 10% at this energy. To separate this phase information from other contributions to the signal, such as absorption in the sample, inhomogeneous illumination or imperfections of the gratings, a phase-stepping approach used in visible-light interferometry was adapted to this setup. One of the gratings is scanned in the direction x perpendicular to the grating lines over one period of the grating, and for every point of the scan an image is taken. The intensity signal I(x,y) in each pixel in the detector plane oscillates as a function of the grating position.</p><p>The phases φ(x,y) of the intensity oscillations in each pixel are related to the wave-front phase profile Φ(x,y), the X-ray wavelength λ and the period g of the absorption grating and the distance d between the two gratings by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">). 1 ( x g d ∂ Φ ∂ = λ ϕ</formula><p>Importantly, φ(x,y) contains no other contributions, particularly no absorption contrast. The phase profile of the object can thus be retrieved from φ(x,y) by a simple one-dimensional integration. In the general case where the wave front impinging on the object already shows some distortion, the background phase distribution should be measured with the object removed from the beam and then subtracted. Even in cases where the range of phase values exceeds 2π by far, such as in the example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, the method still works well because the measured quantity φ(x,y), essentially the first derivative of Φ(x,y) (Eq. 1), will not exceed 2π as long as the phase gradients in the sample are not too steep. This is a clear advantage over methods that record Φ(x,y) directly, as in this case the phase shifts in the image are mapped onto an interval of [0,2π]. This gives images consisting of interference fringes that require complicated phase unwrapping algorithms for a quantitative interpretation. The described method was applied to image an animal organ, a rat heart, which was placed in a container filled with a 4% aqueous formalin solution. We used the wiggler source at beam line ID19 of the ESRF. The detector consisted of a Gadox scintillator optically coupled to a FRELON CCD camera. The field of view was 14x14 mm 2 . The image resolution was determined by the point spread function of the CCD and the scintillator to ~7.5 micron.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the absorption, differential phase contrast, and integrated phase image of the sample. Due to the limited size of the synchrotron beam of 15 mm in the vertical direction, the image has been stitched together from two sub-frames. In absorption contrast (left), only some fatty tissue is visible, whereas the complete organ with many details can be seen in the differential phase contrast image (center). Quantitave phase image images (right) were obtained by applying linewise integration to the differential phase contrast data.</p><p>The experimental results show that a grating interferometer can be used for qualitative or quantitative twodimensional x-ray phase radiography of specimens in aqueous solution. The possibility to make large gratings of high quality and efficiency, suggest that hard X-ray phase imaging with grating interferometers can find application in areas where phase imaging would be desirable, but is currently not widely used. In particular, the possibility to combine the instrument with imaging systems of an even larger field of view let us envisage applications in such fields as medical and biological imaging. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Franz Pfeiffer* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Christian David* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Christian Gruenzweig* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Oliver Bunk* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Marco Stampanoni* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Amela Groso* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Konstantins Jevimovs* (Paul Scherrer Institut), Peter Cloetens* (ESRF) Report:</figDesc></figure>
