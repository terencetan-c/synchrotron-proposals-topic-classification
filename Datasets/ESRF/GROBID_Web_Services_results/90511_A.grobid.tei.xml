<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the last years, pressure-induced crystal-fluid interaction in microporous and microporous-like materials (e.g., heterosilicates) has shown a raising interest, especially in the fields of materials science and mineralogy. Up to know, among minerals, only zeolites and recently, a few phyllosilicates have shown the ability to adsorb small molecules, thus possessing the potential for tailoring new materials or new properties. Heterosilicates, among them armstrongite (CaZrSi6O15•3H2O) and narsarsukite (Na2(Ti,Fe 3+ )Si4(O,F)11), due to their peculiar crystal structures, similar in some regards to those of zeolites, are eligible candidates to adsorb small molecules of geologic and/or technological interest, in particular H2O and CO2. During the beamtime we started to investigate the behavior of those minerals when compressed in potentially penetrating media. Armstrongite, compressed in a mixture of methanol, ethanol and water up to ca. 8 GPa, undergoes a phase transition at 4.50 GPa, likely connected to the tilting of the Zr-octahedra (similarly to what shown in elpidite, its Na-analogue). Unfortunately, the triplication of the unit-cell volume following the phase transition, and the related increase in the number of independent variables, prevented the structure solution of the high-P polymorph of armstrongite, hindering a comparison between the high-pressure structures of armstrongite and elpidite. A second set of data has been collected after the phase transition, rotating the DAC at χ = 0 and 90° at the same pressure conditions, in order to allow a sufficient reciprocal space coverage for the structure solution. Analysis of these data is currently in progress. Nevertheless, this study highlighted the wider Prange of stability of armstrongite (in which the phase transition occurs only between 4 and 5 GPa) in comparison with its Na-analogue elpidite, confirming the higher P-stability of Ca-phases in comparison of Na-phases. No clear evidences of P-induced fluid molecules intrusion have been observed. Narsarsukite has been compressed in a mixture of methanol:ethanol:water, up to ca 1.5 GPa. Preliminary data suggest the absence of any P-induced intrusion of the fluid molecules, with a significant bulk compressibility. Structure refinements are in progress, in order to disclose the structural mechanisms accommodating the volume compression.</p><p>The results obtained in these experiments provide a fundamental benchmark to which base future investigations, as it clearly appears that a cold compression in fluids bearing water and small alcohol molecules does not trigger the P-induced intrusion phenomenon shown by several zeolites. The use of a small or moderate amount of heat (moderate temperature) should be tested, combined with pressure, in order to check if these heterosilicates (armstrongite and narsarsukite) may show a zeolite-like ability in adsorbing small molecules into their structural nanopores.</p></div>		</body>
