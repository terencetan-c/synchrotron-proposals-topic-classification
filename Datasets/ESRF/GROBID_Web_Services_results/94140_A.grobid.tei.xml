<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>On-site user operation or use of the animal facilities was not possible in December 2020 due to the COVID-19 situation. Instead, fixated post-mortem samples were submitted to ID17 and handled by beamline staff (Alberto Bravin, Michael Krisch) while staying in communication with the user group via Zoom. Scans were started by beamline staff or remotely by users via Guacamole. The purpose of this experiment was to:</p><p>1. Narrow down the selection of six available types of X-ray contrast agents for in vivo experiments 2. Investigate the difference in results between injection into the ventricle or cisterna magna 3. Evaluate the need for K-edge subtraction for the final results</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Identify technical issues</head><p>Due to considerations of possible leakage of contrast agent out of the CSF spaces, high molecular weight (high MW) and nanoparticle-based blood pool contrast agents were evaluated along with standard low molecular weight (low MW) angiography contrast agents (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Each of these contrast agents were injected into the mouse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space, either into a lateral ventricle or into the cisterna magna. 12 mouse cadavers covering all these combinations plus 12 duplicates as a reserve were submitted to the beamline, as well as 3 cadavers without contrast agent injections for comparison.</p><p>These were mounted into the first iteration of the user-designed, additively manufactured mouse holder for in vivo skull measurements. This holder was designed for correct positioning of the skull to minimize bone density in beam direction, minimal number of holder parts in the field-of-view, full plastic construction, mechanical skull fixation and body heating (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). Mouse skulls were imaged with monochromatic beam at photon energies above and below the absorption edge of the respective X-ray contrast agent. 4000 projections were recorded per scan with 100 ms exposure time at 3.1 µm voxel size, using a half-acquisition scheme with asymmetric rotation axis to extend the field of view of the 2560 pixel wide pco.edge 5.5 camera. The resulting scans allowed us to determine optimal parameters for the in vivo experiment:</p><p>1. ExiTron nano 12000, the barium nanoparticle-based X-ray contrast agent had the most even distribution throughout the CSF space and provided sufficient contrast for segmentation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>, <ref type="figure">C</ref>). 2. Contrast agents injected via the cisterna magna had difficulties reaching the ventricular spaces, while ventricular injections showed good distribution throughout the entire CSF space. 3. ExiTron nano 12000 showed sufficient contrast in scans above the K-edge that it was possible to automatically segment CSF spaces separately from the skull. K-edge subtraction imaging was therefore not required to achieve the study goals, simplifying further experiments. 4. Necessary design changes for the mouse holder were identified. Placing of teeth and ear bars without breaking parts was difficult for newly trained personnel, increasing time for mounting, which would be problematic for the in vivo experiment. An increase in robustness, tightness of fit and speed of mounting an animal will be the focus of the revision.
