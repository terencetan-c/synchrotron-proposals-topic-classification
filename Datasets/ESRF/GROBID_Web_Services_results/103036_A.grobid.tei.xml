<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Bimetallic electrocatalysts for Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells -intermetallic synergy and structural alterations </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the measurements at the LISA beamline at the ESRF, materials consisting of the nickel cermet infiltrated with different transition metals were studied. Samples were provided in both oxidized state (marked as OX) and reduced in pure hydrogen at 800°C (marked as RED). Additionally, some reference materials, such as manganese oxides or Co-containing spinels, were measured as well. Materials were measured in the transmission mode at room temperature. As the amount of infiltrated metals was low (~3 wt.%) when compared to the nickel (~50 wt.%), the absorption signal from the Ni K-edge overwhelmed other materials. In case of the K-edge of elements with atomic number lower than Ni (Z&lt;28), this problem was solved by the cutting off the Ni K-edge energy range, however the signal remained noisier. Unfortunately, for Cu-impregnated cells, the EXAFS signal of Ni K-edge was significantly overlapping with Cu K-edge, which made it impossible to measure Cu edge in transmission mode and because of this reason, for Cu-modified samples, fluorescence mode was applied. Collected data was analysed using the Athena software. Because the Ni spectra were of perfect quality, the Fourier transform was performed to analyse the EXAFS region and to determine the changes in the local surrounding of Ni atoms with respect to different infiltrated metals. FT was not implemented for Cu/Ni-YSZ samples, as in this case, the Cu K-edge was disturbing the EXAFS spectra of Ni.</p><p>The XAS spectra for Ni-edge in both oxidized and reduced states are presented in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (left). For the reduced infiltrated cells, the signal can be contributed totally to the nickel in the metallic state. Additionally, no significant differences can be found after reduction between various infiltrated metals: neither in edge position nor intensity nor the EXAFS region. Considering the oxidized materials, the increase of the white lines' intensity can be seen, when compared to the reduced samples. This observation indicates presence of nickel oxide in the cells. On the other hand, signs of metallic nickel can also be found, such as formation of the pre-edge feature (at ~8330 eV), which is characteristic to Ni metal and originates from transition from 1s to 3d orbitals. Another indicator is the EXAFS spectra similar to the reduced ones, which means that the local environment of the nickel atoms is dominated by the metallic surrounding. As all cells were reduced prior to the infiltration process, all the aforementioned observations can be expected. During the firing, nickel could be partially oxidized either to nickel oxide, or the Ni-transition metal compounds. Interestingly, distinct changes in the white line intensity are observed for manganese and iron infiltrated materials. The observed intensity decrease comes from the lower amount of transitions available between 1s and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) orbitals. It can be possible that such behaviour originates from formation of other Ni-Mn or Ni-Fe compounds or the lower amount of oxidized nickel, as the pre-edge feature is also slightly more intense for those two samples.</p><p>The FT EXAFS signal (with phase correction of 0.5 Å included) is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (right). The EXAFS analysis has proven that in reduced cells, nickel is present in completely metallic state, as can be seen by the peak formation at about 2.45 Å, which is almost the exact value as Ni-Ni bonds length in metallic nickel (Fm-3m) -2.46 Å. Similar feature is visible for oxidized sample, which is in line with theory that Ni environment is dominated with metallic bonds. However, around 2.79 Å, an additional peak is formed and its intensity differs between different samples. This peak may be originating from the Ni-Ni bonds in NiO (2.9 Å) or other species such as spinel structures. Although, with respect to both the intensity of the main peak and the decrease of the second, especially for Fe and Mn-infiltrated cells, it is more probable that this additional feature originates from NiO formation, rather than other structures. Moreover, as stated before, the K-edge spectra of respective metals infiltrated into Ni-YSZ cell were also collected and are presented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The XANES region of manganese with all the reference materials is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. As Mn is hardly reducible metal, the pure signal from metal itself is rather hardly expected, different from Ni spectra. In the case of oxidized sample, it was found out that the XANES spectrum originates from the presence of Mn3O4 and Mn2O3, while after the reduction, the oxides were reduced to MnO. What is more it is probable that a small amount of Mn nanoparticles were formed upon reduction, as the pre-peak feature consistent with this from Mn foil can be found. Another clear evidence for reduction to Mn/MnO is the significant shift of the white line of reduced material to lower energies.</p><p>Wide-range XAS spectra of Mn, Fe, and Co are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. For the infiltrated metals, Fourier transform analysis was not implemented, as the signal was strongly disturbed by the Ni K-edge. But one can say a little about changes in the local environment by analysing the EXAFS range n Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. It's clearly seen that for the Coimpregnated cell, after reduction the Co was present mostly in the metallic neighbourhood, as the EXAFS signal is similar to that of the Co foil. At the same time, small amount of oxidized cobalt remained in the sample, which is suggested by remaining small edge feature at 7725 eV, which can be attributed to Co 2+ . At the same time, XAS spectrum for oxidized sample got a white line, which position (7727.5 eV) lies between Co3O4 (7729 eV) or spinel structure CoNi2O4 (7726.7 eV). Generally speaking, both XANES and EXAFS of the oxidized cell infiltrated with Co, may be considered as dominated by Co3O4 presence with traces characteristic of CoNi2O4 spinel (like small feature at the slope of the white line), which is consistent with our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A similar case may be considered for the Fe-infiltrated sample, as the oxidized cell is fully characterized by presence of Fe3O4 oxide. After the reduction, the intensity of the peak decreases significantly and a shift toward lower energies can be observed, confirming the reduction of Fe ions. However, spectrum of the reduced sample is not equal to collected Fe foil, one should keep in mind that reference foil could have been partially reoxidized which would influence the signal. It cannot be excluded that after the reduction, Fe can be found in both metallic and oxidized state (most probable FeO). Moreover, the additional peak at around 7130 eV can be linked with FeO in the sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Although, considering the reduction temperature of the iron oxides, the 800 °C should be enough to completely reduce iron oxides to its metallic form. Also, EXAFS spectrum of analysed material differs significantly from metallic characteristics (unlike Co on Ni, described before), which would strongly suggest simultaneous presence of some Fe 2+ ions. The analysis of the Mn spectra was presented in more detail in the previous paragraph.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): 1. *Patryk Błaszczak, Advanced Materials Center, Institute of Nanotechnology and Materials Engineering, Faculty of Applied Physics and Mathematics, Gdansk University of Technology, ul.
