<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effect of molybdenum on the synthesis of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) polymer gels. To introduce the molybdenum to the RF gel system the standard preparation process was modified. A pre-polymerization period was applied, whereby the aqueous sol containing the resorcinol, formaldehyde, and sodiumcarbonate was placed in an oven for incubation at 70°C, in order to promote the polycondensation reaction. This period is referred to as pre-polymerization time. After the given period, an appropriate amount of ammonium-heptamolybdate (AM) solution was added to the RF sol. Seven samples, with pre-polymerization times varying between 70-120 min were measured. One additional sample, containing only sodium-carbonate as a blank sample was also prepared and investigated. The samples after addition of the AM solution were inserted into borosilicate capillaries of 1.5 mm in diameter and placed in the thermostated (70°C) measurement chamber. Owing to the relatively slow gelation procedure of these systems, the samples were measured over several hours to follow the structural and dynamical changes. Prelilminary results from the data analysis show that the presence of molybdenum affects the kinetics of the process significantly. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. presents a set of normalized, time averaged correlation functions (g <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> (q,t)) measured in samples after 100 min of pre-polymerization, with and without the presence of molybdenum. In the case of the blank sample no relaxation of the correlation functions was observed before 152 min after the addition of the catalyst (Na 2 CO 3 ) solution at the end of the pre-polymerization period, while with molybdenum the process is immediately slow enough to fit into the time window of the measurement. The result of the fits obtained by the Kolrausch-Wiliam-Watts formula are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>In the case of the blank sample at early stages the dominant processes that govern the dynamics are related to the diffusion of the primary clusters, as the exponential behaviour of Γ with q suggests (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). At later stages the relaxation rate exhibits a linear dependence on q. In the case of the Mo-catalysis the system is always in the hyperdiffusive state, Γ being propotional to q (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). Further analysis of the data to discover the effect of the applied prepolymerization time is in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Normalized, time averaged correlation functions at q=0.00435Å -1 of (a) the blank sample (b) Mo-catalysed sample.
