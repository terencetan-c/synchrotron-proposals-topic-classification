<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>The allocated beamtime was just sufficient to realize most of the study described in our proposal and we have recorded room-temperature fluorescence EXAFS and XANES spectra at the In K-edge (27.94keV) using the 30-element energy-resolved detector. It was the first time that FAME was used to reach such a high energy edge. The beamline mirrors M1 and M2 were thus escaped, and the monochromator directly received the full incoming X-ray beam. Therefore, the front slits had to be closed to 1.5x40 mm2 to make the monochromator's LN 2 cooled first crystal temperature stable around -141°C. Studied samples are made of AlGaN epilayers doped with different amount of In and deposited onto a thick GaN substrate. Therefore, the fluorescence detector was completely saturated with Ga K emission lines, and two 6µ filters of Cu and Co were used to desaturate the detector. Also, the Compton diffusion was very intense, so that for In content around 2%, it was difficult to record correct XAS datas. Finally, we had a lot of Bragg diffraction peaks superimposed on absorption spectra. Therefore, prior to data acquisition, we have extensively used quick-EXAFS scans to adjust X-ray incident angle on sample to minimize the number of (annoying) Bragg peaks.</p><p>As reference, we used a metallic In foil, In(9%):GaN (E338) and In(8%):AlN (S1447). We were able to record good quality XAS spectra for 4 samples: In(2%)Al(41%)Ga(57%)N (S1352), In(7%)Al(24%)Ga(69%)N (S1264), In(11%)Al(36%)Ga(53%)N (S1251) and In(14%)Al(22%)Ga(64%)N (S1249). As detailed analysis is still under way, no clear conclusion are yet available. Nevertheless, we may reject the hypothesis of an In incorporating preferentially with a Ga surroundings shell independently of the Al presence, since the S1352 (2% In) doesn't look like the E338, but the S1264 (7% In) does. Clearly, In incorporation site depends on both Ga and Al. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure A and B shows the comparison of all recorded EXAFS data: EXAFS oscillations and pseudo-radial distribution. Clearly, there is a major change in second nearest neighbors nature with the amount of incorporated Indium. 1. As awaited, In:GaN (E338) and In:AlN (S1447) are completely different since 12 second neighbors of Ga are remplaced by 12 Al: less intense EXAFS oscillations and droping more rapidely. 2. The S1352 (2% In) look neither like In:GaN (E338) or In:AlN (S1447) 3. The S1264 (7% In) and E338 are very similar: 7% of In inside AlGaN look like In:GaN 4. The S1251 (11% In) and S1249 (14% In) are very different from E338. Back-scattering by the second nearest neighbors shell is much less intense: part of the 12 Ga may have been substituted by Aluminum or some In have specifically incorporated inside Al shell.</figDesc></figure>
