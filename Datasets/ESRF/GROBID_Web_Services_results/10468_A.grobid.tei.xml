<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was the first investigation of the topographic contrast of dislocations using the three-beam case in Bragg-Laue diffraction geometry. In the three-beam case, two reflections h and g are simultaneously excited and three strong wave fields K(O), K(h), K(g) exist inside the crystal. /l/ The directly excited wave diffracted by the lattice planes of h and the detour excited wave successively reflected on the lattice planes of g and h -g propagate in the same direction. (h -g describes the Umweg wave inside the crystal.) Owing to the coherent excitation of all internal waves it comes to interference effects between these waves, a Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: three-beam case in complicated standing wave field is created inside the crystal. For the the direct space (crystal) systematical investigation of such a case, a \v -rotation (a rotation around one of the primary diffraction vectors e.g. h) was used. The h and g reflections were arranged in the Bragg (reflection)-and the Laue (transmission)geometries respectively. With this experimental setup we could take several series of plane wave topographs in different three-beam interferences. The control parameter was the w -position of the crystal. For a single Bragg reflection the penetration length of the waves inside the crystal corresponds to the extinction length. Beyond this distance in the crystal the whole intensity is reflected. /2/ This is no more valid in the Bragg-Laue three-beam geometry. In this case, the Bragg reflection on h is coupled with the Laue transmission on g over h -g and a larger crystal thickness can contribute to the intensity of the Bragg reflection.</p><p>Despite the fact that all the results are still under analysis as this experiment ended only one month ago, we can already say: The penetration (information) depth of the Bragg reflected beam is a function of the excitation of the three-beam case. New contrast phenomena in the dislocation images were found. The most characteristic ones are intensity oscillations produced around the dislocations, especially for the w positions with a constructive interference between the direct and Umweg-waves (compare for instance Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The detailed interpretation of the data is not finished at present. references /l/ Heyroth, F.; Eisenschmidt, C. &amp; H&amp;he, H.R.
