<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this ID20 experiment was to confirm a resonance observed in the σσ channel in the type-IA phase of UAs at the As Kedge <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. After the first day of beamtime it was concluded that this signal, measured in an XMaS experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, was a spurion as no such signal was observed at ID20. The remaining ID20 beamtime was used to perform two studies: (1) to measure the As K edge resonance lineshapes in the σπ channel in order to obtain data to compare with the previous XMaS study and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> to study for the first time in UAs resonant scattering at the U M 2 edge.</p><p>(1) As K edge study Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the As K edge resonance lineshapes measured at both specular and offspecular satellite positions in both antiferromagnetic (AF) phases of UAs, the type-I (k = 1 rlu) and type-IA (k = 0.5 rlu). Shown for comparison are the lineshapes measured in the XMaS experiment. The lineshapes are equivalent at specular and off-specular positions in both phases. It is worth noting that in the case of the type-I phase, the ID20 data is less "noisy" on the high-energy side of the resonance than the XMaS data. (2) U M 2 edge study Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the lineshapes measured at the U M 2 edge in both polarization channels and for both AF phases of UAs. The fitting curves are to the standard dipole oscillator model for resonant scattering. In the case of the σπ scattering, the lineshapes are strongly asymetric due to interference with a non-resonant magnetic scattering component. In the type-I phase, only one resonant component is required to fit both the σσ and σπ lineshapes and is attributed to a quadrupole (3p to 5f) process. However, in the type-IA phase a second resonant component is required to fit the σπ lineshapes. This is attributed to a dipole (3p to 6d) process. The attempted fit using a single resonant component is shown by the dotted lines in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d</ref>) and (e). In conclusion, our ID20 experiment has confirmed the As K edge (σπ) lineshapes measured at XMaS and has obtained new data at the U M 2 edge. It is worth noting that studies at both of these edges provide information about hybridization in UAs. An article to present the results of both of these studies is in preparation and will be submitted to Physical Review B. Theoretical calculations of the As K edge lineshapes in UAs have already been performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and are not confimed by our experiment. It is hoped that these experimental results will stimulate further theoretical work, for both the As K and U M 2 edges.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
