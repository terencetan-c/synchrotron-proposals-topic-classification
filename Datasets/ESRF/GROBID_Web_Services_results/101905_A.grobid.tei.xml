<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>TiLV polymerase + vRNA and TiLV polymerase + cRNA (2x6000 images) Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) is a recently discovered pathogen affecting tilapia fish and belongs to the Amnoonviridae family within the Articulavirales order. It has 10 genome segments with distinct conserved ends that encode proteins with no known homologs, except for segment 1, which encodes an orthomyxo-like RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase core subunit. Our recent research demonstrated that segment 1 forms a heterotrimeric complex by interacting with proteins encoded in segments 2 and 3.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Based on those three CM01 cryo-EM data collections, we solved multiple highresolution structures and found that segments 1-3 encode respectively the PB1, PB2, and PA-like subunits and form a heterotrimeric complex. Despite an unprecedented overall size reduction of 40%, TiLV polymerase still retains all the essential domains found in distantly related influenza polymerases.</p><p>In addition, we obtained multiple TiLV polymerase active states, including pre-initiation, initiation, and active elongation (with the highest resolution of 2.4Å), revealing how TiLV polymerase binds to vRNA and cRNA promoters and performs RNA synthesis. Both transcriptase and replicase configurations were characterized. However, the highly truncated endonuclease-like domain seems inactive, and the putative capbinding domain is autoinhibited, suggesting that many functional aspects of TiLV polymerase remain to be studied.</p><p>A paper titled "Structural and functional characterization of the minimal orthomyxovirus-like polymerase of Tilapia Lake Virus from the highly diverged Amnoonviridae family" has recently been submitted. It includes 12 cryo-EM structures, 11 of which are from CM01, all with a resolution better than 3Å.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FluPolB + cRNA + ANP32A + CTD (6000 images)</head><p>The current model suggests that the influenza virus polymerase (FluPol) can bind to either host RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) or the acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32), influencing its conformation and directing its activity towards viral genome transcription or replication, respectively.</p><p>Through a combination of cell-based and in vitro approaches, we have demonstrated that the RNAP II C-terminal domain, in conjunction with ANP32, enhances FluPol de novo replication activity. Based on these findings, we propose a model where the host RNAP II serves as the anchor for both transcription and replication of the viral genome.</p><p>To support our findings, we collected cryo-EM data on CM01, enabling us to obtain multiple high-resolution structures of influenza A polymerase (H7N9). Specifically, we observed FluPol in (i) a replication initiation-like state (2.5Å), (ii) a replicase conformation (2.9Å), and (iii) a stalled elongation state (2.5Å), all bound to the host RNAP II CTD.</p><p>Our research has unveiled initial evidence suggesting that the FluPol-RNAP II binding interface plays an overlooked role in the replication of the viral genome, opening up new perspectives on understanding the spatial coupling of viral transcription and replication, as well as the coordinated balance between these two critical activities.</p><p>A paper titled "The host RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain is the anchor for replication of the influenza virus genome" has recently been submitted.</p></div>		</body>
