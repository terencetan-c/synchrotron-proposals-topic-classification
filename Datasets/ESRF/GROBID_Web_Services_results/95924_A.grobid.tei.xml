<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scaffolds</head><p>Scaffolds were obtained from thermoplastic polyurethane TPU or TPU + chondroitin sulfate blends using an electrospinning apparatus (STKIT-40, Linari Engineering, Pisa, Italy) equipped with a high-voltage power supply (Razel R99-E 40 kV), a 10 mL syringe with inox 21G needle, and a volumetric pump (Razel R99-E). A static and flat collector was used to obtain the random. The lengthwise-aligned tubular scaffolds were collected in a tubular shape using a cylindrical rotatingdr um in stainless steel (dimensions: diameter: 3 mm; length: 150 mm; wall thickness:0.3 mm). Scaffolds were hydrated in water and observed at two saple-to-detector distances ( 1m and 10m)</p></div>

The addition of the polysaccharide affects dramatically the structure of scaffolds on the mesoscale.
