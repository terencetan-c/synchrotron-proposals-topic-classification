<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This experiment was based on the results of an earlier experiment (ME-944) which had documented the principal capability of Fe-K edge XANES to quantify the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio and the contribution of different Fe-bearing phases to mineral mixtures and soil samples. Now, we applied the prepeak analysis to (i) a soil toposequence from a forested watershed in the Fichtelgebirge/Germany constituting a hydrological gradient, to (ii) a dissected aggregate from a Eutric Gleysol near Freising/Germany, and (iii) to annually-laminated lake sediments.</p><p>For organic and mineral horizons of the investigated soil toposequence, an increasing groundwater influence was clearly reflected in an increased contribution of Fe(II) species to the total iron content of the respective soil samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Similarly, the concentration of Fe(II) increased from the most oxic soil (Dystric Cambisol) to the most anoxic soil (Rheic Histosol) and the contribution of the Fe-oxyhydroxides, as calculated by LCF, decreased. Iron oxides are an important soil component in terms of stabilizing soil aggregates and reducing erosion losses. In different soils with different water regimes and/or different physico-chemical condtions, dissolved Fe species can be transported both between and inside aggregates and root channels. Solution or precipitation processes according to changing redox conditions may take place at the rims or in the centre of soil aggregates. Several focussed XANES spectra on a profile across the dissected aggregate uncover the differences in the contribution of ferrous and ferric iron compounds, depending on the specific location and the total Fe content of the investigated spot (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Moreover, X-ray microscopy revealed that in the studied aggregate the distribution of Mn minerals is uncoupled from the distribution of Fe oxides. These results underline how much can still be learned using the unique ability of XANES to analyse chemistry as well as mineralogy on a micrometer scale. Another advantage of this technique is its applicability to poorly crystalline minerals, which often dominate Fe phases in soils. We expect that by examining the microscale complexity and inhomogeneity of Fe minerals in different soils XANES can greatly contribute to a better understanding of the cycling of Fe and related nutrient elements (e.g., S, P).</p><p>The capability of Fe-XANES to distinguish between sulfidic and oxidic Fe minerals was also applied to samples of an annually-laminated lake sediment. The undisturbed sediments were cut perpendicular to the lamination, so that the sedimentation of certain years was exposed at the surface. Spatially resolved Fe-XANES show pyrites in close vicinity with Fe-oxides, i.e. within a distance of a few microns. Non-sulfidic phases are sometimes enriched in Mn, while in other sediment sections P-rich Fe minerals (Fe-phosphates?) occur. Since the pyrites show no signs of oxidation, we must assume a simultaneous deposition of sulfides and oxides, i.e. these minerals must have formed at different redox conditions at different waterdepths.  0.01 0.03 0.05 0.07 0.09 0.11 0.13 0.15 7110 7112 7114 7116 7118 7120 Energy / eV Transmission / a.u.
