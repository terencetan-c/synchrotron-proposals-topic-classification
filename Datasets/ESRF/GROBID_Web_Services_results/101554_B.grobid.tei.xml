<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Here, we report a correlative hard X-ray study of InAs/GaAsSb quantum dots (QDs) systems. Solar cells based on QDs are excellent candidates as novel photovoltaic devices due to their high efficiency (limit value of 63%, exceeding the 41% limiting value of ordinary solar cells). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> An enhancement of 20% in power conversion efficiency has been demonstrated in these InAs/GaAsSb QD solar cells over the standard InAs/GaAs QD counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> However, many questions are still open about the influence of Sb distribution in the band alignment and wavefunction topology. Using the hard X-ray nanobeam of ID16B station, InAs/GaAsSb QD solar cells with different Sb contents in the CL were studied regarding the Sb influence on the structure and the properties of the solar cell. The aim of the experiment was to obtain deeper insights into the origin of the efficiency enhancement with high statistics and superior correlations from large representative sample volumes.</p><p>For this experiment, we selected two InAs/GaAsSb QD solar cells (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) with different Sb contents (10% and 28%). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is applied to map the QDs areas, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is measured to explore the local structure of In and Sb individually. The experiments were carried out using a beam lateral resolution of 80×60 nm 2 . The XRF maps were taken at 30.5 keV (excitation energy above the Sb K-edge located at 30.49 keV). The spatially resolved XANES data were acquired in XRF detection mode around the In and Sb K-edge (27.94 keV and 30.49 keV, respectively).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref> shows the average XRF spectrum acquired on the sample with a 28% Sb content, using a pixel size of 50×50 nm 2 over a 900×900 nm 2 sample area and 1s/point integration time. Despite the elements present in the sample, the Mo peak is related to the monochromator used in the optical setup. The In and Sb XRF signal distributions are presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref> respectively. The elemental distribution showed contrasting areas with different In intensity while the Sb distribution was very homogeneous. The regions with higher In signal indicate the accumulation of In, suggesting a higher amount of QDs. The assumption that high In content indicates a high amount of QDs is supported by simulations that consider the QDs distribution (measured by AFM, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2d</ref>) and the beam size (80×60 nm 2 ) to produce the image contrast expected in the experiment. The resulting simulation is presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2e</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2f</ref>. As observed, the map resembles the experimental In XRF map (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>) corroborating that the measured contrast of In signal indeed enables localizing QDs areas. To study the effect of a possible Sb segregation in the capping layer, XANES around the K-edges of In (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>) and Sb (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>) was performed in the regions with high and low densities of QDs. The signal obtained for the In K-edge was weak and difficult to interpret beyond the location of the white line. Regarding the local environment of the Sb, no changes in coordination or electronic states are observed in the GaAsSb layers by the formation of QDs. A GaSb sample was measured around Sb K-edge as reference. Similar coordination can be observed between the GaSb reference and GaAsSb layers, with a slight shift towards higher energies in the case of GaAsSb, which may reflect a shorter scattering-absorption distance caused by the smaller bond lengths in the GaAs crystal. In addition, XANES spectra were also acquired in devices with different Sb content as displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>, showing in both cases an intense narrow peak at around 30.50 keV attributed to the white line. The X-rays induced current (XBIC) was simultaneously measured with the XRF and XANES scans for further correlations. Due to technical problems related to the electronic configuration of the beamline, the XBIC measurements acquired during the experiment are not valid being necessary new experiments for the aimed inoperando analysis expected in the initial proposal. We anticipate repeating the XBIC measurements in the near future to complete the experiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: (a) Average XRF spectrum.
