<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Local contact(s): Dr. Dipanjan Banerjee Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Daniel Hermida Merino -Dubble/ NWO Bing Wu* -Dubble/Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Report:</p><p>Alginate is a biomaterial that has promise in numerous biomedical applications due to its favourable properties, including biocompatibility and ease of gelation. Alginate hydrogels have been particularly attractive in wound healing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering applications, as these gels retain structural similarity to extracellular matrices and can be manipulated to play several critical roles. The gelation rate is a critical factor in controlling uniformity and strength when using cross-linking cations, and slower gelation produces more uniform structures and greater mechanical integrity. One critical drawback of ionically cross-linked alginate gels is the limited stability under physiological conditions, as these gels dissolve by releasing divalent ions into the surrounding media in exchange for monovalent cations. This replacement of divalent ions with monovalent ions occurs with all ionically cross-linked alginates currently discussed in the literature.</p><p>In order to avoid this exchanging, we developed a novel glass-based formulation, where the alginate material has controllable setting kinetics and strengthens over time under physiological conditions due to a slow and continuous release of di-and tri-valent ions from the glass phase. This continuous release of ions from the glass phase is dependent on producing a stable glass structure wherein there is a large number of charge balanced tri-valent gallium ions which form a tetrahedral structure with the silicon and phosphorous ions in the glass, maintaining a high network connectivity (NC) within the glass but allowing the glass to be liable to acidic attack. This tetrahedral acid liable structure has previously been shown to exist in the glass ionomer cement structure by using aluminium ions. However, aluminium ions, unlike gallium ions, have been shown to be neurotoxic and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. To the contrary, gallium has been shown to illicit antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour propertie. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, even after 48 hours of ion release, the neat eluent from the injectable did not cause any significant change in cell viability for Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (BASMCs).</p><p>By performing the in-situ EXAFS-XANES analyses of these injectables with different gallium ratio, the tetrahedral/octahedral ratio of gallium in the medical glasses and its change during the degradation period of the injectable would be understood in correlation with the gel strength studies done before.</p><p>In this study, both ex-situ analyses of analyses and insitu analyses on the Ga-based galsses were analyzed. As show in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the change in the weight ratio between Ga:Al does not affect the coordination of Ga inside these glass systems.</p><p>The whole Ga K-edge FT EXAFS peak can be fitted with a distorted tetrahedral model, the evolution of this peak suggested a 2 stage formation of this Ga-based hydrogel in GDL solution. The set of experiments promotes the understand of the formation and evolution of this Ga-based medical glasses in acid soluton (GDL), and the manuscript is under prepartion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
