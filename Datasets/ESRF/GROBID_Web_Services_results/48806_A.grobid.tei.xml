<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Aims</head><p>The dimer I has been previously isolated and is known to react with primary amines to give the monomeric species II. The addition of both amine and an alkoxide base ultimately results in reductive elimination to give an aryl amine. Previous studies at BM23 (CH-3315) and B18 at Diamond had given good static measurements of dimer I and the structures formed on addition of hexylamine, sodium tert-pentyloxide or both. Using the fast time resolution capabilities of ID24 in conjunction with the stopped-flow/UV-vis apparatus available on the beamline we hoped to determine the presence of any intermediates formed during these chemical reactions. It was hoped that analysis of the data compared with the static standards previously obtained would allow some structural information about the intermediates to be extracted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p>1. As first users on the new ID24 beamline, the allocated beamtime also represented the first commissioning of the beamline to use the stopped-flow/ UV-vis with electronic triggering to allow high accuracy synchronisation of the chemical experiment with simultaneous recording of both UV-vis and XAS data. This process required optimisation of ESRF control software and electronic triggering as well as beam adjustments but was very successful resulting in an optimised system suitable for use by all users of this equipment at the beamline.</p><p>SPhos Ph Pd Cl Pd Cl Ph SPhos R NH 2 SPhos Ph Pd N H 2 Cl R Ph Pd N SPhos R H N H R Ph SPhos Pd + NaO t pentyl R NH 2 NaO t pentyl I II</p><p>2. The stopped-flow apparatus is fitted with Viton O-ring seals, which are primarily suited only to aqueous solutions. This severely limits the range of organic solvents which can be used with the apparatus. The experimental studies could therefore only be made in toluene. This had the side effect of preventing studies using sodium tert-pentyloxide due to its low solubility in this solvent.</p><p>3. Studies on the addition of hexylamine to dimer I in toluene were conducted after optimisation of the timing and data collection parameters. The conversion of starting dimer I to monomer II could be easily identified in the recorded spectra. Unfortunately a very high degree of non-statistical noise was present severely limiting the interpretation of the data. The poor quality of the data limits any interpretation to the XANES region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spectra of dimer I in toluene (a) and after the addition of hexylamine (b)</head><p>The noise prevents an easy analysis of the reaction of the system over time although temporal analysis of key peaks in the spectra allows a broad trend to be observed. Crucially, we did not observe any decomposition of the sample in the beam, further confirming the suitability of this approach for studying these systems.</p><p>Temporal evolution of two peaks in dispersive XAS and a peak in UV spectrum removed to allow full interpretation of the reaction under study. In addition, the improvement in the quality of the data would allow analysis of a wider range of the data including the EXAFS region.</p><p>In addition, the replacement of the stopped-flow O-rings with a material more suitable for the study of homogeneous catalysis in organic solvents would allow other solvents to be used which would allow the studies with sodium tert-pentyloxide to be performed. This modification would also widen the scope of this equipment on the beamline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>• Stopped-flow/UV-vis apparatus commissioned with electronic triggering by beamline software. Experimental setup of this system proved suitable for use with new ID24.</p><p>• The data obtained demonstrated the suitability of the new ID24 beamline for studying homogeneous catalytic systems at the Pd K-edge. The system chosen does not decompose in the beam.</p><p>• The conversion of dimer I to monomer II was observed. Unfortunately the data was of insufficient quality to allow a detailed analysis of the sample composition to be made with a high degree of confidence (eg. using linear combinations or principle component analysis).</p><p>• The advancement of this project relies on obtaining better quality data using the Laue polychromator which is expected to be commissioned on ID24 in early 2013.</p></div>		</body>
