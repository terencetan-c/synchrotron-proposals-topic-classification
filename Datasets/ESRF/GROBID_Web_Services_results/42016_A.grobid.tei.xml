<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Series of experiments aiming the fabrication and characterization of Fe and FePt magnetic nanoparticles has been performed within the DFG Project PO 1275/2-1 "SEMAN". The current proposal was dedicated for structural investigation of Fe and FePt nanoparticles embedded in yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as a result of Fe and FePt self-assembling, where Fe and Pt ions were doped by means of ion implantation at energies of 110 and 325 keV respectively.</p><p>The first part of the application assumed the investigation of secondary phases in YSZ crystals implanted with Fe only. The range of fluences of implanted Fe + ions was broadened in respect to initially planned from 1×10 14 …1×10 16 (cm -2 ) up to 1×10 14 …3×10 17 (cm -2 ). The longitudinal 2θ/ω and transverse ω-scans in double-and triple crystal diffraction mode were performed for all samples in order to reveal the presence of magnetically active Fe-based secondary phases. No additional reflections from pure iron or iron oxides were found for the samples implanted with the fluences of 1×10 14 …3×10 15 (cm -2 ). High resolution scanning of the reciprocal space close to the vicinity of reciprocal lattice of YSZ substrate did not resolve significant increase of x-ray diffuse scattering with an increase of ion fluence. This result can be caused by the creation of solid YSZ:Fe solution which is possible in the case of low-fluence implantation. Another reason of the reflections absence of Fe (Fe x O y ) phases is the amorphous structure of the inclusions. The samples implanted with the higher fluences of 1×10 16 …3×10 17 (cm -2 ) represent diffraction peaks from α-Fe, γ-Fe as well as from oxide-rich (Fe x O y ) phase.</p><p>The x-ray diffraction study of these samples is in good agreement with Mössbauer spectroscopy performed at FZD. Combination of the experimental results obtained at ROBL and in-house research exhibits a variety of possible phases created in YSZ crystals after highfluence Fe implantation. Moreover, it was found that Fe nanoparticles possess the Fe-core/ Fe x O y -shell architecture where the shell thickness is strongly dependent on the size of the nanoparticles. The results of the experiments are submitted to the Journal of Applied Physics.</p><p>The second set of samples examined during the beamtime consists of YSZ crystals implanted with Fe and Co ions with overlapping ion distribution profiles at the depth of 55 nm. Although the ferromagnetic response of those samples was relatively strong (much stronger then in case of YSZ:Fe), the expected FePt (or any other ferromagnetic) phase has not been detected using x-ray diffraction. Such a confusing result forced us to attest, for a presence of contaminations, also the back, non-implanted side of specimens. It has been found that the backsides of substrates were contaminated with Fe giving the reflections of bcc iron (magnetic phase). Rough estimation of contaminations' volume made us convinced that iron presented at the nonimplanted side of the samples is a main source of the observed ferromagnetism. Afterwards it was found that contaminations, most probably, were introduced by metallic clamps employed for the sample holding during the implantation of this particular set of samples. The nonimplanted side of YSZ:Fe samples described early was also examined. Contaminations were not found in those samples. In order to avoid such situations in future, the list of recommendations for technical personnel and experimentalists involved to the research has been worked out.</p></div>		</body>
