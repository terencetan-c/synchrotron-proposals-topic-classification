<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Magnetic ordering is intimately related to local atomic environment (nature and distances of neighboring atoms) and mechanical deformation can lead to a wide range of interesting phenomena. The coupling between mechanics and magnetism is particularly evident in ordered intermetallics that undergo plastic deformation, where dislocations may place atoms on new atomic sites, and therefore create new chemical environments and interatomic distances. In a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> the group at UCSB has investigated the influence of plastic deformation on the magnetic behavior of the ferromagnetic Heusler alloy MnAu2Al. A decrease in net magnetization after plastic deformation of compressed ingots or ground powders of MnAu2Al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has been observed, which shows the role of plastic deformation on magnetic properties in this intermetallic alloy; the converse could also be a potent effect wherein long-range magnetic order could influence the energy landscape for dislocations and their mobility. The relative simplicity and large magnitude of this mechanism makes the further exploration of plasticity in ordered intermetallics a promising direction for obtaining mechanical control over magnetic behavior. It is the aim of the present experiment to investigate in detail the plasticity of the simple room temperature ferromagnet MnCu2Al (L21 structure with space group ùêπùëö3 $ ùëö) Heusler alloy. To achieve this goal, we have compressed MnCu2Al single crystal micropillars and followed in situ elastic deformation as well as defect initiation by using micro-Laue diffraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of samples</head><p>Sample preparation is decribed in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Wedges have been first prepared fom bulk sintered polycrystals. The orienetation of the grains at the top of the wedge have been determined by EBSD (Electron back-scattered diffraction). Then 50 microns wide pedestals are etched from the top of the wedge with a fs laser. Finally micron-sized pillars are etched from the pedestals with FIB (Focused Ion Beam). This procedure allows getting micropillars that are fully detached from the bulk and thus easy to reach with the X-ray microbeam. An example of as-prepared sample is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the experiment at the beamline: methodology and results</head><p>For in situ microcompression tests, the nanoindenter FT-NMT04 (FemtoTools) [2] equipped with a diamond flat punch was brought by IM2NP group and installed on the goniometer of the BM32 beamline. This was actually the first time this device was installed on BM32 beamline. During compression in displacementcontrolled mode with a displacement rate of 30 nm/s, Laue microdiffraction patterns were recorded using a sCMOS camera installed at 90¬∞ with respect to the incident polychromatic X-ray beam. The beam size on the 40¬∞ inclined sample was 300 nm x 500 nm. Cyclic loading-unloading curves with increasing maximum load were applied to each micropillar until a clear sign of plastic deformation was visible in the load-displacement curve. During compression, in order to prevent any unwanted additional force in the sample under loading time scans at a fixed position on the pillar were acquired. 2D Laue microdiffraction maps were recorded of the micropillars both in their pristine state and after compression. An example of such an experiment is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for pillar 8 on wedge 2. Plastic yielding occurs at a force of 16 mN, which translates in a yield stress of 520 MPa. The unloaded pillar exhibits a plastic strain of 3.7%. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 b</ref> and <ref type="figure">c</ref> show mosaics of a single Laue spot from the pristine and unloaded pillar. A 45¬∞ inclined band where the Laue spot has gone outside the pre-defined box is most probably a sign of slip. A thorough analysis of crystal rotation using the LaueTools software is underway. Table 1 is a list of analyzed samples together with their orientation, Young's modulus and maximum Schmid factors. The orientation of the pillars is more easily visualized in the inverse pole figure representation shown in figure 4. In total sixteen samples have been measured on the beamline (12 compressed in situ and 4 measured postmortem).

Four samples have been mechanically tested at UCSB and measured postmortem at ESRF. Twelve samples have been compressed in situ on BM32. Young's moduli are calculated from the constants of elasticity reported in [3] and maximum Schmid factors are calculated for the {110}&lt;111&gt; slip systems reported in [3]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and future work</head><p>For the first time the FT-NMT04 nanoindenter has been installed successfully on beamline BM32. Twelve single crystal MnCu2Al micro-pillars have been compressed in situ while recording Laue diffraction patterns.</p><p>A detailed analysis of these patterns (in particular the rotation of the crystal lattice) is underway using the LaueTools software and the LaueTools neural network (newly developed by the BM32 beamline staff). In addition, the compressed pillars are being thoroughly characterized by transmission electron microscopy. This successful experiment opens avenues for continuing using in situ Laue microdiffraction for the investigation of the coupling between plasticity and magnetism in Heusler alloys. In particular, it would be of high interest to investigate the plastic behavior of alloys such as MnCu2Al, which is not ferromagnetic at room temperature.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Schematic of the fabrication workflow for micropillars.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.99,37.84,527.35,234.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>
