<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mtd is an enzyme of the methanogenic pathways isolated from Methanopyrus kandleri. Crystals obtained from MPD as precipatant adopted the space group C222 1 with unit cell parameters of 120 A, 151 A and 220 A for the native enzyme and 120 A, 151 A and 110 A for the selenomethionine labelled enzyme. We collected a native data set to 1.9 A resolution with an overall R sym value of 7.6%. Moreover, we measured a complete MAD experiments at the selenium edge to 2 A resolution with R sym values between 4.3 % and 7.6 %. The peak data set of a second crystals was measured. However, the selenium sites could not detected. Finally, we measured a high resolution data set of the selenomethionine-labelled enzyme crystals up to 1.5 A resolution with an R sym of 7.6%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">ATP sulfurylase</head><p>ATP sulfurylase is the final enzyme sulfide or sulfur oxidation to sulfate. Crystals from Allochromaticum vinosum obtained from sodium citrate had the space group P2 1 and the cell parameter were 73 A, 97 A, 73 A and 118°. A complete data set was collected with an R sym of 6.1% in the resolution range 30.0 -1.6 A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">4-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase (4-OH)</head><p>4-OH is involved in the anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. Crystals from Thauera aromatica grew in the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with cell parameters of 113 A, 115 A and 174 A. The resolution of the data was 1.65 A and their quality was excellent (R sym = 6.3 %).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">ATP-binding subunit of the sulfate ABC transporter (CysA)</head><p>CysA is involved in the sulfate transport into the inner membrane of bacteria. CysA from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius was crystallized in the space group P2 1 with the cell parameters of 155 A, 56 A and 92 A. Native data up to 1.9 A resolution were collected. The R sym value was 5.8 %.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Formaldehyde-activating enzyme (FAE)</head><p>FAE is an enzyme of the methylotrophic pathway and converts formaldehyde to methylentetrahydromethanopterin. Crystals from Methylobacterium extorquens grew in the space group P4 x 2 x 2 with cell parameters of 120.8 A and 206.2 A. Native data were collected up to 1.9 A resolution; the Rsym was 5.4%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">γ γ γ γ-subunit of the sulfite reductase (DsvC)</head><p>Sulfite reductase is involved in sulfate reduction to sulfide, DsvC might playing a role by transporting electrons. DsvC from Archaeoglobus fulgidus was crystallized in the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , the cell parameters were 39.9 A, 46.5 A and 57.2 A. A complete data set was collected at 1.1 A resolution. The R sym value was 7.8 %.</p></div>		</body>
