<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Surface diffusion and island size evolution of mixed thin films of sexi-thiophene and fluorinated sexi-thiophene using time-resolved specular and off-specular scattering </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>As stated in the proposal, we have performed structural characterization of mixed thin films of sexi-thiophene (6T) and fluorinated sexi-thiophene (PF6T) in different mixing ratios using time-resolved X-ray scattering technique. The aim was to have a detailed knowledge of the structure and morphology of such mixed films (which are often employed in organic devices like light emitting diodes and photovoltaics); particularly the out-of-plane and in-plane ordering using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). All films were prepared in a custom built portable ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber provided by us. The films were grown via home-built Knudsen cells, and controlled precisely by water-cooled quartz-crystalmicrobalance. A temperature regulation of the substrate holder enabled us to vary the temperature of the substrate. A beryllium window in the UHV chamber allowed us to uninterruptedly track the progress of the film growth using X-ray scattering without any exposure of the samples to ambient conditions. Finally we checked for the data reproducibility and radiation damage. Detailed quantitative analysis is in progress, so we present some preliminary findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement and data</head><p>The ID10 beamline is very suitable because of its surface/interface scattering and diffraction expertise and resolution. The data sets are of high-quality with high signal-to-noise ratio inspite of the fact that the scattering signals from thin organic films (~ 20 nm) are not very strong. The beam was very stable and reliable during the time alloted to us and we managed to succesfully measure most of our samples. In order to follow the growth in real-time we selected a compromise between time resolution, spatial resolution and the desired q-range of the measurements. Mixtures with five different 6T:PF6T ratios were prepared viz. 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. For the 1:1 mixing ratio, three different substrate temperatures (213K, 303 K and 343 K) were used. For all growth runs, the total growth rate was regulated at 0.2 nm/min. The film growth was followed via GIXD scans using a PILATUS detector. All real-time measurements were followed by detailed post-growth characterization once the growth was complete. The preliminary analysis of the XRR and GIXD data show promising results which we outline in the following.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the XRR profiles of the samples where a systematic variation in the out-of-plane lattice parameter between pure 6T and PF6T is observed. The position of the Bragg peak for the mixed films with major fraction of 6T were closer to the 6T peak while the ones with a dominant PF6T mixing ratio were closer to the PF6T Bragg peak. This suggests that there might be mixing of the pristine materials at the molecular level and that the out-of-plane spacing is determined by the molecule which has the higher mixing ratio. This is explained by the fact that the 6T and its fluorinated counterpart PF6T have strong interaction with each other and tend to form molecular mixtures which has a different structure than the pristine materials. Figure1: XRR measurement of pure and mixed films of 6T and PF6T in different mixing ratio. A systematic shift in the position of the Bragg peaks is observed from F6T to 6T. Figure2: GIXD measurement of pure and mixed films of 6T and PF6T in different mixing ratio. Some mixed phases together with excess phases of the pristine materials is observed .</p><p>The GIXD measurements (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) of the pure as well as the films with different mixing ratio shows that the in-plane Bragg peaks are prominent for the respective dominating mixing material. We also observe the presence of some peaks which do not belong to either 6T or PF6T and can only be associated to a mixed phase formed out of the molecular level mixing of the pure materials. This is consistent with the observation from our XRR measurements (Figure1) and also on previous studies of pentacene and fluorinated pentacene. While most peaks correspond to the upright standing-up phase of such (rod-like) molecules, some lying peaks of PF6T is always visible. However, no lying peaks of 6T could be observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and progress of evaluation</head><p>The XRR and GIXD data have to be analysed to compare structural features and the effect of different mixing ratios. This would help to correlate the structural features of such mixed thin films to their opto-electronic properties. Complementary measurements like AFM, ellipsometry and differential reflectance spectroscopy are currently being performed additionally.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the help and support of our local contact Giovanni Li Destri.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>, Christopher Lorch, Alexander Gerlach, Frank SchreiberInstitut f체r Angewandte Physik, Universit채t T체bingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 10, 72076 T체bingen, Germany</figDesc></figure>

Such mixing behavior has already been seen in pentacene and fluorintaed pentacene mixed systems[Hinderhofer et al.  J. Chem. Phys. 134 (2011)  104702].</figDesc><graphic coords="3,285.37,192.00,256.18,229.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
