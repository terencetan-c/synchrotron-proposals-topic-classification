<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In the past decade, there has been a growing concern about the use of nanoparticles/nanomaterials which are now present in 1000+ consumer products. Particularly, the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria NPs (CeO 2 ) makes them attractive for a large range of application like oxidation catalysts, gas sensor, polishing materials, but also as UV absorber as paint additive. This property is related to the easy Ce III /Ce IV redox cycle associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies in CeO 2 . However, toxicity of CeO 2 NPs has been demonstrated for living organisms and the reactivity is induced by the presence of Ce III . So, attractive technological impact due to the presence of Ce III within structure of CeO 2 has to be considered together with potential environmental consequences after release in the environment.</p><p>To date, most of the research done on the environmental risk of NPs only concerns the hazard characterization, and rarely the exposure assessment. Moreover, the nano(eco)toxicological studies are mostly based on one kind of NPs exposed to one biological species in standardized and artificial media (e.g. micro-organisms, vertebrates, or invertebrates). Within the ANR-P2N MESONNET project, a mesocosms network was designed to assess the environmental risk of nanotechnology within environmentally relevant conditions. With these mesocosms, we study the distribution, transformation, and bioaccumulation of NPs within complex systems and working with environmentally relevant concentrations (&lt; 1 mg/L).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>By combining different analytical approaches (e.g. µXRF, XRD, ICP-MS, DLS) we have identify the preferential zones of NPs accumulation in sediments and organisms from the mesocosms. This XAS experiment at the Ce L 3 -edge consisted in determining Ce atomic environments in the different compartments following a single injection of 1 mg/L or 10 chronic injections of 0.1 mg/L of CeO 2 -NPs. We evaluated the exposure and impact of two CeO 2 -NPs: a surface modified CeO 2 -NPs with citrate moieties used as paint additives (Nanobyk ® ), and an uncoated CeO 2 -NPs (Rhodia ® ).</p><p>Ce L 3 -edge XANES measurements on samples and reference compounds were performed at 5 to 10 K (helium cryostat), to avoid any possible dehydration or oxidation of samples. They were carried out on beamline BM30B/FAME with a Si(220) crystal monochromator operating at 6 GeV and 90 mA. The XAS spectra were all recorded in fluorescence mode, using a thirty-element solid-state germanium detector (Canberra, CT, USA). Surficial sediments, digestive glands (DG) of freshwater molluscs (Planorbus corneus), egg-layings, and juveniles were freeze-dried before XAS analysis. Individuals from the 3 replicates were mixed so that the amount of sample was enough for the XANES analysis, and to take into account the diversity between the 3 replicated mesocosms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Ce L 3 -edge XANES analyses of P. corneus were performed to determine the speciation of Ce after ingestion or adsorption on the shell of the organisms. Both bare CeO 2 -NPs and coated CeO 2 -NPs are initially composed by Ce IV . This is confirmed by their XANES spectra characterized by 2 absorption peaks at 5730.0 eV and 5738.0 eV while Ce III reference compounds are characterized by one absorption edge at 5726.2 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Ce in the DG of adults P. corneus possess a Ce III signature for both bare and coated CeO 2 -NPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). LCF of XANES spectra with initial NPs and Ce III -cysteine reference compounds indicated that after 4 weeks, 78±1 % (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) of Ce is reduced into Ce III in the DG. The reduction of Ce IV into Ce III occurred less than one week after exposure. Surficial sediment was also analyzed by XANES and Ce IV was mainly present in sediments during the 4 weeks of experiments with minor contribution of Ce III (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2)</ref>. For juvenile P. corneus and egg-layings, the reduction into Ce III was less important (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). For juvenile, the LCF indicated that 47±5% of the Ce IV is reduced into Ce III after 4 weeks (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The egg-  XANES analyses were performed on all samples envisaged. XAS results were put in perspective with oxidative stress data to evaluate the fate and impacts of CeO 2 -NPs within aquatic ecosystems. Two publications based on the data acquired during this XAS session are currently in progress.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.
