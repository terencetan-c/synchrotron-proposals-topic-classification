<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: X-ray diffraction measurements of 3D residual stress fields below surface anomaly in a Nickel-base superalloy Experiment number: MA-3647 Beamline: ID22 Date of experiment: from: 22 November 2017 to: 28 November 2017 Date of report: 1 st March 2018 Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): Mr. Andy Fitch Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Besnik SADRIJI* -PhD student at LMT, Ens-Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay Karine LAVERNHE* -Assistant Professor at LMT, Ens-Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay Yoann GUILHEM* -Assistant Professor at LMT, Ens-Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay Report:</p><p>Context and objectives A synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiment, MA-3647, has been carried out at the ESRF on ID22, in order to measure the residual stress field below V-type dents. In fact, current models consider surface anomalies, like dents, as initiated cracks of similar depth and propagating from the first cycle. Besides giving shorter propagation life compared to experimental data, preliminary studies showed that induced compressive residual stress field beneath the anomaly influences the first stages of crack propagation and thus are responsible for conservative results. In order to develop a new crack growth model accounting for initial residual stress fields and their evolution, it is necessary to measure them. For more precision about the context see the proposal for the ma3647 experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objects of interest</head><p>The experiment focuses on V-shaped dents of three different depths: 200𝜇m, 150𝜇m and 100𝜇m. Two types of samples have been studied, the "non-relaxed" ones and the "relaxed" ones. The "non-relaxed" ones are the specimens that just contain the flaw itself. So that the initial gradients and multiaxial state of residual stress fields are characterized. The "relaxed" ones are the specimens that have been subjected to pre-cycle fatigue under temperature, giving information about how the residual stress fields evolve both in terms of gradients and multiaxial state. Two kinds of samples have been extracted from the specimens in order to access all the components of the residual stress field see  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental technique</head><p>The material of interest is a Ni-base superalloy INCO718 DA which is used as bulk material for disc components of aeroengines. Its mean grain size is ~10μm and contains 4 phases: the γ matrix (FCC) and three types of precipitates (γ', γ'' and δ). The monochromatic beam at λ=0.1771 Å with energy 71 keV allowed us to measure the lattice spacing of the (111) plane of the γ matrix.</p><p>The nine-channel crystal analyzer is used to detect the diffracted x-rays and for our material the best compromise scan-time/quality of the scattering angle window is 2θ111 ∈[4.84, 4.94] see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. The nominal gauge volume is 0.05 (Y direction) x 0.15 (Z direction) x 1 (X direction) millimetres so that the volume contains enough grains that diffract.</p><p>In order to correctly place the samples in front of the beam and scan the region of interest, two procedures of surface and flaw detection have been set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p>Measurements have been made on 9 samples representing the 3 depths, the "non-relaxed" and "relaxed" states and the three components of the residual stress field for a total of 19 scans see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. "Wall" and "column" appoint respectively for sample A and sample B. The component along X was not measurable with wall samples. To access all the different components, the samples were put in different positions see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>The first scan took about 8 hours. It was important to get a full map of the residuals stress fields before adjusting it to our needs. At the end the scans lasted about 5 hours, installation of the sample included.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Thanks to this experiment, the residual strain fields are quantitatively described in terms of gradients, multiaxial state and relaxation. It is then possible to determine the residual stress field thanks to a constitutive law of the material of interest. An overview of the results is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>Table.1 -Exhaustive list of the scans made with the different depths and samples Fig.3 -Positions of the sample to access all the components Fig 4.a depicts the deformation 𝜀zz map beneath the 200𝜇m V-dent. As expected, there is a compressive region in the first 500𝜇m under the flaw. Then, the residual strain field goes in tension in order to maintain "equilibrium" in the material. This grid allows us to characterize the residual strain field in an extended zone around the flaw. Fig 4.b illustrates the multiaxial state and the relaxation of the residual strain field. It gathers the deformations 𝜀yy and 𝜀zz of the 200𝜇m deep V-dent at the center of the flaw and along the depth of the non-relaxed and relaxed states. The extreme values of deformation reached 𝜀zz = -0.0042 and 𝜀zz = 0.0022 respectively correspond to 𝜎zz ~ -830 MPa and 𝜎zz ~ 430 MPa according to an isotropic elastic law and are consistent with the simulations, besides finding the same evolutions.</p><p>It is also shown that the residual stress field is multiaxial and that the relaxation occurs as it is expected. The results on other depths, 150𝜇m and 100𝜇m show the same evolutions but at a lower rates in absolute terms, as expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions &amp; perspectives</head><p>The MA-3647 experience was very stimulating, first by the process of sample preparation and especially at the ESRF. We took some time to take over the system, then try some scans to find the best timeanalysis/quality ratio. In the meantime, procedures to have a "live" post-processing of the datas have been set so that the results can be analyzed to adapt our needs. Among the specimens studied, some flaws have been submitted to a cyclic loading under temperature in order to characterize the relaxation of the residual stress field. The results of this experiment are very satisfying as they first quantitatively describe the gradients, the multiaxial state and the relaxation of the residual stress field, and second go along with what was expected. Thanks to these measurements, considerations have gone further concerning the investigation of the multiaxial state of the residual stress field. The flaws considered for the relaxation were orthogonal to the anomaly whereas their orientation may differ in real life. In order to have a representative measurement of the residual stress field under a "non-orthogonal to the loading direction" flaw we could consider, for example, dents turned of 45° from the loading direction. Also, another type of flaws, like scratches, introduces an initial non-symmetric multiaxial residual stress in the material. These flaws are part of the proposal for the end of the year as a continuation of the MA-3647 experience. Studying the 45°-dent and the scratch would allow us treating general cases and how the multiaxial state of the residual strain field evolves. In the meantime, an innovative numerical simulation procedure is developed in order to reproduce the flaw introducing and the cyclic loading. These results are the reference for the procedure consistency.
