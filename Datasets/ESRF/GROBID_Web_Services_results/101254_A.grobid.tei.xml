<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>The aim of the experiment was the investigation of the Pb speciation of lead based wall painting mock-ups treated with chemical and physical treatments (cold plasma and others) and compare the artificial alteration with naturally altered lead pigments coming from hystorical wall paintings. All of the investigated samples consisted of lead pigments applied with a casein binder on a lime based mortar substrate (dimensions 2 x 2 x (0.2-0.5) cm 3 ). Three different lead based pigments were investigated: 1) lead white (2PbCO 3 •Pb(OH) 2 ) with a thickness of ca. 30-50 µm;</p><p>2) red lead (Pb 3 O 4 ) with a a thickness of ca. 100 µm; 3) plattnerite (PbO 2 ), which is a common lead pigments alteration, with a thickness of ca 200 µm. The case studies consisted of small fragments of 2 x 2 x 1 mm 3 and a powder (measured in a borosilicate glass capillary of 1 mm diameter) of altered lead pigment from a 17 th century wall painting from Sicily. The samples were allocated in the experimental chamber attached to a holder with adhesive tape the experimental investigation proceeded operating X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Fluorescence mode carried out at the Pb L 3 edge (13035 eV). A Pb foil was allocated in the transmission geometry to check alignment every certain set of measurements. A set of consecutive XAS were performed in the same area to control, at the specific setting, the occurence of potential radiation damage. Once defined the operating condition, several spectra were acquired in different spots around the surface sample to evaluate the homogeneity of the treatment. The Pb standards were measured in fluorescence and prepared in pellets of boron nitrate at 5-10%. No particular experimental issues occurred. A total of ca. 2 h and a half of beam lost occurred. Never the less, all the samples were successfully investigated (24) as well as a set of relevant standards (11). For some of the samples, although the very thick Pb layer (paint layer varying between 50-200 um), the transmission signal was also detected and registered.  In the case of basic lead carbonate mock-ups the XANES give significant information suggesting a structural change of the carbonate to oxides maintaining the lead(II) oxidation state, but the artificial alteration do not cause further transformation to plattnerite.</p><p>Regarding the case study with potentially altered lead white, the signals obtained are very poor due to a very small amount of Pb in the painting layers and from the low signal-to-noise spectra acquired on the fragments there is no clear suggeston of the presence of Pb(IV) as alteration product of lead white but it could be present in a very small percentage below the detection limit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary conclusions</head><p>Performing XAS on the treated mock-ups provided description of the structure and chemical nature of Pb to cheracterize the effects of physico-chemical artificial and natural lead pigments alteration. The comparison of the data sets acquired with the fluorescence and TEY signals at BM08 and the fluorecence spectra at high sectral resolution of BM16 and the complementary in-house XPS measurements on the mock-up suggests a higly superficial action of the plasma and different alteration products depending on the starting lead based pigment.</p><p>a b b a</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Maria Amelia Suzuki* -Institute of Heritage Science ISPC-CNR Cristiano Riminesi* -Institute of Heritage Science ISPC-CNR Francesco Di Benedetto* -Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra Univ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary survey of the obtained results</head><p>For the lead oxides (both red lead and plattnerite mock-ups) the preliminary analysis of the XANES spectra provided significant information. The XANES acquired at the previous allocated beamtime at BM08 were of difficult interpretation as the XANES of all the most significant lead oxides compounds for our experiment presented very similar spectra (FIG1a). Thanks to the higher energy resolution we have been able to distinguish in a clear way the majority of the lead oxides (FIG1b).</p><p>For the red lead, the plasma treated samples do not show significant variation from the spectra of the pristine reference mock-up (FIG <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). In the previous beamtime a small difference was observed between the Total Electron Yield (TEY) spectra and the fluorecence spectra (FIG2b), suggesting a very superficial enriched layer of Pb(IV) (in agreement with the type of plasma treatment applied). The comparison of the results of both data sets is very useful to evaluate the significance of small spectral changes and provide insights on the in depth stratification by comparing the spectra acquired in Fluorecence, transmission and TEY mode. </p></div>
