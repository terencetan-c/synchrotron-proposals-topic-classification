<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Radiation induced phase transition in Polydiacetylene (PDA) Langmuir Film (LF)</head><p>The investigation of PDA LF was done at the air-water interface by GIXD technique. PDA LF exist in two chromatic phases (blue and red) which differ by their color and subsequent absorption maxima 1 . TEM 2 and AFM 1 were used to determine the crystal structure of PDA for both phases. The transition from blue to red can be activated chemically, thermally, mechanically and by high radiation dose 1 . The blue to red transition is accompanied by shortening the average conjugated length in the polymer direction and is coincident with the reorganization of the molecular side chains.</p><p>The aim of the first experiment was to use in-situ GIXD in order to monitor the phase transition of PDA LF at the air-water interface. The same film was exposed to different radiation doses by controlling the dose of UV radiation or of synchrotron light. With increasing radiation dose, prominent changes in the structure of the PDA LF were observed, which indicate a structural phase transition from the blue phase to the red one. This transition, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, seems to be discontinuous (discrete) and dependent on the radiation dose applied to the film.</p><p>When the applied dose is not sufficient for the blue-to-red transition, the film remains in the blue phase. On the other hand, when the radiation dose exceeds a certain threshold, the entire film is found exclusively in the red phase. This is manifested in a change in the q xy and q z position of the two Bragg peaks obtained from the centered rectangular structure to higher q xy values (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Note the shift in position of the peak at q xy =1.18 and q z =1.1 [Ǻ -1 ] along the same arc (radius corresponding to the same q total ) to circa q xy =1.60 [Ǻ -1 ] and q z close to zero from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>. Between these two extremes, coexisting forms of both chromatic phases are observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>,c) 3 . Based on these GIXD results, a model describing the long range molecular arrangement corresponding to each phase is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Comparing these unit cells to previous reports on ex-situ measurements (electron diffraction in the TEM 2 , AFM 1 ) clearly shows that the structure of solid-supported PDA LF at the air-water interface is different from that observed after transfer onto solid supports. This observation will be studied in subsequent GIXD experiments.</p><p>The second goal of this experiment was to determine the structure of the trilayer PDA LF in the vertical direction, and to compare the structure of the first layer (in contact with the</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">q xy [Å -1 ] q z [Å -1 ] Blue phase Red phase A B C D</formula><p>aqueous subphase) with that of the two other layers. Interestingly, our attempts to polymerize PDA LF compressed to area per molecule values corresponding to a single layer resulted in clear cut evidence for spontaneous transition of the films to the trilayer form. Stabilization of the monolayer structure was possible only with cations such as Cd 2+ present in the subphase at sufficiently high concentration, but this could not allow direct comparison with the trilayer structure on pure water. The data is not shown here due to the limited scope of this report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The influence of divalent ions in the subphase on the structure of PDA</head><p>In our previous experiments, the effect of the presence of several divalent metal ions (Pb 2+ , Cd 2+ , Zn 2+ ) in the subphase solution on the PDA structure was established and found be correlated with the ionic radius 3 . In the current experiment the influence of two additional ions was investigated (Ba 2+ , Ag + ). The former was chosen due to its significantly larger ionic size, and the latter was a monovalent rather than a divalent cation. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> below. The monovalent Ag + ions barely affected the PDA structure, while the addition of Ba 2+ ions lead to the stabilization of blue phase of PDA. The mechanism in which these ions influence the PDA LF is not completely understood and will be carefully investigated in future experiments using anomalous x-ray scattering.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Radiation induced chromatic transition of PDA LF.

In both phases the molecular tilt is parallel to the conjugated direction. (Ellipses indicate the projection of the alkyl chains onto the surface). The blue to red transition is accompanied by a decrease in molecular tilt from 35° from the surface normal to a nearly vertical position and simultaneous decrease of the distance between conjugated strands to the van der Waals distance. 3 This is in agreement with FTIR measurements of similar PDA structural transition. 4</figDesc><graphic coords="2,96.30,398.70,336.96,145.86" type="bitmap" /></figure>
