<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the structure-activity relationship of a CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst in propane total oxidation and redox treatments by an in-situ method, combining absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Cu K and Ce L III and on-line catalytic measurements using mass spectrometry (MS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed</head><p>With undiluted catalyst loaded into a reactor capillary of 0.8 mm outer diameter, good quality XAS spectra were obtained: for Ce LIII edge, XANES was measured up to k = ~ 4 Å -1 , while for Cu K edge EXAFS was recorded to k = ~ 8 Å -1 . Gas-phase compositions were obtained, using a calibrated MS (Omnistar TM ). For both Cu and Ce, isothermal experiments were performed consisting of catalytic red/ox cycles with C 3 H 8 /He or H 2 /He and O 2 /He resp.. Further, total oxidation reactions were carried out under simultaneous flow of propane and oxygen with ratio 1:10 for 3 space times at 3 temperatures. Isothermal reduction with 5% C 3 H 8 /He in 50K steps up to 673K (400°C) caused the Cu to reduce completely to Cu 0 , passing through an intermediate oxidation state of 0.9±0.2 at T = 623K (not shown). The Ce edge started showing effect of the propane reduction at the highest temperature 673 K (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). White line analysis (WL) of this edge yielded a steadily decreasing value of average oxidation state, to reach 3.73 ± 0.07 at a temperature of 673 K. This means that about 27 % of the Ce is then present as Ce 3+ .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: left: isothermal hydrogen reduction of the catalyst CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 followed at the Ce L III edge; line = glitch used for alignment (solid lines, 5% H 2 /He, 1.86 10 -7 mol H 2 /s); reference spectra in dotted line; right: ratio Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ of contributions in the XANES spectra during isothermal H 2 reduction versus reduction temperature as result of a LCF XANES spectra with Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ references as standards Isothermal reduction with 5% H 2 /He abruptly changed the copper phase in the catalyst from CuO to Cu between 473 K and 523 K. The Ce L III XANES started changing from 473 K on and progressed further than with propane. A linear combination fit (LCF) was performed on the XANES spectra using the Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ reference spectra as standards and resulted in a variation of Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio versus reduction temperature as in figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. At the first temperature 473 K, 26 ± 1% of the observed Ce is already in 3+ oxidation state. This is observed mainly in the first white line, which shifts to the left (lower energy) and tends to develop a shoulder. The amount of reduced Ce further grows with increasing temperature to reach 0.48 ± 0.04, i.e. almost half of the Ce species is reduced at 673 K. During total oxidation experiments no changes occur in XANES, indicating that both Cu and Ce remain fully oxidized during reaction (not shown). From the MS measurements, the conversion of propane could be obtained as function of space time, leading to an Arrhenius plot which yielded an apparent activation energy of 68.74 KJ/mol (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 left</ref>). Simulating the data with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in a plug flow reactor yielded a reasonable correlation between experimental and calculated data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> right). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>From the above it is clear that in catalytic reactions with a CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst, the CeO 2 promoter is not a spectator but takes actively part in the reaction. Reduction experiments with propane or hydrogen show a clear partial reduction of the CeO 2 at temperatures close to those where CuO is being reduced. Whether CeO 2 directly reacts with the gas phase or supplies oxygen to the reduced CuO phase, needs to be determined. The total oxidation behaviour of the catalyst can be described reasonably with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The results described here are currently being processed for publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: left: Ce L III XANES for isothermal reduction cycles ((solid lines, 5% C 3 H 8 /He, 1.86 10 -7 mol C 3 H 8 /s); reference spectra in dotted line); straight line: position of glitch in pre-edge region used for alignment; right: WL of the Ce L III edge XANES spectra. solid squares: energy position of the WL for CeF 3 and CeO 2 (3+ and 4+, resp.); solid line: linear relationship between WL energy position of references and their oxidation state; open circles: energy position of the Ce L III WL of CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 during propane reduction.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,27.72,576.96,252.00,140.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
