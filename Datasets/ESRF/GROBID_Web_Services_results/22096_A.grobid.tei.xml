<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) study was carried out at the XMaS beamline in December 2001 by the University of Leicester in collaboration with the University of Liverpool. The samples consisted of gold nanoparticles (~2.0nm in diameter) in toluene. The aim of this beamtime was to initially assemble the particles on a water surface in a langmuir trough and subsequently transfer the arrangement to a solid substrate using either the Langmuir-Schaeffer or Langmuir-Blodgett techniques. Computer controlled barriers on the trough allow the packing densities of the clusters to be varied and the behaviour can be characterised by measuring isotherms (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and Brewster angle microscopy (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows isotherms (surface pressure versus water area) for a solution of particles for three compression and expansion cycles (labelled). Several features are immediately apparent; the compression and expansion cycles follow different paths, indicating some hysteresis. Additionally, the paths are different depending on the number of previous cycles again indicating some non-reversible behaviour. There are other more subtle features in the curves, including a bump in the compression curves that always appears at a surface pressure of close to 7mN/m. This is typical of a phase change or collapse of the langmuir layer and we attribute it to a transition from a fully compressed layer to a disordered multilayer structure. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> indicates the domain structure present in the layer, at the micron scale. The structure in Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> indicates that prior to compression, the particles all appear in bands in one layer, whilst after a full compression-expansion cycle they have aggregated into permanent fractal like branches (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). We believe this to be the</p><p>50 100 150 200 250 300 -5 0 5 10 15 20 25 Surface Pressure (mN/m) Area (cm 2 ) 1 1 2 3 2a 2b</p><p>origin of the hysteresis in the isotherm data. Having created the cluster layer, GISAXS measurments were recorded for films transferred to a Si(111) sample using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique (dipping through the layer). Initially these films were compared with those created using the evaporating solvent method, where a drop of solution is allowed to evaporate on a surface leaving behind ordered domains of particles.</p><p>The langmuir deposition method will in theory produce more well ordered domains of particles, due to the increased mobility.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the GISAXS scattering in both the in-plane (Fig <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) and out-of-plane (Fig <ref type="figure">3b</ref>)</p><p>directions. Some differences are visible, in particular the in-plane peak appears broader in the langmuir deposition method, whilst it is absent in the vertical scattering. These results are consistent with the transfer of a single layer to the sample, where there is no stacking normal to the surface and therefore no scattering.</p><p>The broad in-plane peak may be due to the layer being non-close packed. The drop method shows peaks in both directions indicating that a three-dimensional structure occurs even for small volumes of solution. The langmuir-blodgett deposition therefore appears successful and able to transfer individual layers of particles.</p><p>The measurements were then extended to investigate whether a compressed layer could be transferred to the sample and remain in its compressed state. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the GISAXS signal in the in-plane direction as function of the surface pressure. During the compression cycle, the peak is seen to shift slightly to higher scattering angle, indicating that the layer is indeed reamining compressed. However, as the layer is compressed past the monolayer collapse point, the peak shifts to lower angle and has a lower intensity. This is expected if the clusters collapse into multiple layers where the particles relax in the in-plane direction and the scattering is spread in all directions due to the 3d structure of the layers. As the barriers are expanded the peak returns, although it never achieves the same intensity as the original scattering. This behaviour is due to the hysteresis effects caused by the irreversible agglomeration of the particles into the fractal like structure shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>.</p><p>These results show that the langmuir-blodgett deposition method is suitable to transfer ordered arrangements of particles to a solid substrate. It is possible to transfer the particles one layer at a time and the scattering indicates a steady buildup of the layers (data not shown). It is also possible to transfer compressed arrangements of particles to the sample in tact up to the langmuir layer collapse point. The scattering after the monolayer has collapsed indicates that the particles have formed a 3d disordered network. Future measurements will focus on the role of the ligand in the cluster assembly process, by performing similar measuements to those shown in this report as a function of ligand chain length. It is predicted that this will not only change the interparticle separation, but will also have an effect on the long range order of the assembled structures.</p><p>0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Counts Angle(degrees) Solution Drop Langmuir Horizontal 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Counts Angle(degrees) Drop Langmuir Vertical 3a 3b 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 7mN/m 10mN/m 14mN/m 20mN/m 10mN/m 7mN/m Solution (no interaction) Counts (arb. units) Scattering Angle (degrees) Compression Expansion</p></div>		</body>
