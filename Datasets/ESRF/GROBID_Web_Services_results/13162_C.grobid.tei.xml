<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Following the suggestion of the review committee we carried out the temperature dependent magnetic EXAFS (MEXAFS) experiments at a Gd single crystal first. The data were taken at four temperatures (10K, 100K, 200K and 250K) at the L 3 , L 2 , and L 1absorption edges using the gap-scanning as well as the fixed-gap setup of the beamline. As the gap-scanning technique worked very satisfactorily the detailed investigations were carried out with a moving gap to keep the degree of polarization constant for the full photon energy range of ∆E=1200 eV. Using this setup we were able to record MEXAFS data of high quality as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for the Gd L 3 -edge (for the sake of a better comparison, the data for 200K are not presented in this figure). The MEXAFS oscillations χ M (k) can be detected up to a photoelectron wavenumber of k=13.0 Å -1 . A clear temperature dependent damping can be seen also in the corresponding Fourier transforms of the MEXAFS oscillations as given in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. One origin of this damping is the reduction of the magnetization as T=250 K corresponds to a reduced temperature of T/T c ≈0.85. The reduction of the magnetization will lead to a simple scaling of the MEXAFS oscillation by a factor. But there is an additional type of damping which is Debye-Waller factor like ( e k -2 2 2 σ</p><p>) and hence leads to an exponential damping in the magnetic EXAFS. This can be seen from the fact that the MEXAFS oscillations at 250K are only reduced by 50% of the 10K data in the low k-range (k=2.5 Å -1 to k=9.0 Å -1 ) whereas the oscillations are nearly completely damped for the higher k-values starting from k=9.0 Å -1 . This indicates that lattice vibrations influence the spin dependent scattering potential leading to an additional reduction of the MEXAFS signal as it is also found for the regular EXAFS in our experiment. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the normal EXAFS reveals that the temperature dependent damping due to</p><p>4 6 8 10 12 -0.015 -0.010 -0.005 0.000 0.005 0.010 0.015 10K 100K 250K k χ M (k) [Å -1 ] k [Å -1 ] 0 2 4 6 8 0.000 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 0.012 0.014 10K 100K 250K FT[k χ M (k)] [arb. units] R [Å]</p><p>thermal vibrations is described by a Debye temperature of θ D =160 K. This shows that the data recorded at 250 K are strongly damped due to thermal vibrations. This must be taken into account when analyzing the local magnetic fluctuations in detail. We carried out ab initio calculations in order to separate the multiple-from the single-scattering contributions for the normal EXAFS and the magnetic EXAFS signal. It turns out that the consideration of the multiple-scattering paths is essential to describe the fine structure of the MEXAFS and the MEXAFS <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> is the comparison of the experimental EXAFS data with the ab initio calculation (FEFF7) which includes multiple-and single scattering paths. The good agreement between theory and experiment enables us to analyze the temperature dependence of the individual scattering paths.
