<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Density measurements of Fe-Si-C liquid metals are performed on a Paris-Edinburgh (PE) press using X-ray absorption techniques at beamline ID-27 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Pressure is applied to the PE assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(van Kan Parker et al., 2010)</ref> by increasing the oil pressure of the hydraulic press to either 300 bar, 400 bar, or 500 bar. Subsequently, the temperature is increased in steps to superliquidus conditions by ohmic dissipation in a graphite furnace using a DC power supply. In-between heating steps, X-ray spectra are collected of the sample to check whether the sample is liquid or solid. X-ray spectra of the BN and Pt calibrant material are collected to estimate pressure and temperature from isochore crossings of the obtained unit cell volumes according to equations of state (EOSs) of BN and Pt (section A4). When the X-ray spectra of the sample confirm that the sample is molten, one or multiple horizontal X-ray absorption profiles of the assembly are collected. An absorption profile is collected by moving the assembly in horizontal direction through the Xray beam, while photodiodes measure the beam intensity in front of (𝐼 0 ) and behind (𝐼) the assembly. These X-ray absorption profiles are used to estimate the X-ray absorption by the sample at experimental conditions (𝜌 𝑆,𝑃𝑇 𝜇 𝑆 ) (section 2.3). After the experiment is quenched and decompressed, additional horizontal X-ray absorption profiles of the assembly (A) including the diamond (D) container and sample (S) (D+S+A) are acquired at ambient pressure and temperature conditions. X-ray absorption profiles of exclusively the diamond containing the sample (D+S) after recovering them from the assembly are also acquired. These D+S+A and D+S X-ray absorption profiles are used to estimate the absorption by the sample at ambient conditions (𝜌 𝑆,0 𝜇 𝑆 ) (section 2.2). The samples are recovered from the diamond, and their densities at ambient conditions (𝜌 𝑆,0 ) are measured by hydrostatic weighing at the IPGP in Paris, France (section 3). Samples that are recovered from experiments that are performed with identical starting composition are assumed to have identical density at ambient conditions, such that these samples could be weighed simultaneously. This is needed to increase the accuracy of the hydrostatic weighing and to estimate the density of tiny samples that were unsuccessfully recovered from the diamond container (section 3). The results are integrated in a research article about Mercury's interior structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Knibbe et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>

In equation A3, 𝑟 𝑖,𝑖𝑛 and 𝑟 𝑖,𝑜𝑢𝑡 denote the inner and outer radius, respectively, of part 𝑖. Parameter 𝐶 captures the relative difference in gain between the two photodiodes as well as the absorption due to air. Parameter 𝐶 consistently takes values of ~ -1.17 for the data collected in this study. The X-coordinate of the beam's centre is denoted by 𝑥 0 .</p><p>Each absorption profile consists of 200 measurements {𝑋(𝑥 1 ) = 𝑙𝑛 ( 𝐼(𝑥 1 ) 𝐼 0 (𝑥 1 ) ) , 𝑋(𝑥 2 ) = 𝑙𝑛 ( 𝐼(𝑥 2 ) 𝐼 0 (𝑥 2 ) ) , … , 𝑋(𝑥 200 ) = 𝑙𝑛 ( 𝐼(𝑥 200 ) 𝐼 0 (𝑥 200 ) )}, collected with an 0.1 mm 2 X-ray beam (33.2 keV). The dimensions of the X-ray beam are controlled by vertical and horizontal slits. The 200 measurements are collected while moving the assembly in X-direction with a step size of 0.01 mm (i.e. 𝑥 𝑗 -𝑥 𝑗-1 = 0.01mm</p><p>). The data are modelled by 𝑋(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝛽, 𝑥) + 𝑅(𝑥), (𝐴4) with 𝑓(𝛽, 𝑥) = ∫ (𝐶 -𝜌 𝐴 𝜇 𝐴 𝛿 𝐴 (𝑥) -𝜌 𝐷 𝜇 𝐷 𝛿 𝐷 (𝑥) -𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 𝛿 𝑆 (𝑥))𝑑𝑥 𝐿 2 ⁄ -𝐿 2 ⁄ 𝐿 + 𝑅(𝑥) . (𝐴5) In this equation, 𝐿 is the beam width, 𝑅 are the residuals, and 𝛽 = {𝐿, 𝐶, 𝜌 𝐴 𝜇 𝐴 , 𝜌 𝐷 𝜇 𝐷 , 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 , 𝑟 𝐴,𝑜𝑢𝑡 , 𝑟 𝐴,𝑖𝑛 = 𝑟 𝐷,𝑜𝑢𝑡 , 𝑟 𝑆,𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑟 𝐷,𝑖𝑛 , 𝑥 0 }</p><p>is the set of parameters that describe the collected absorption profile (equations A3 and A5).</p><p>The D+S profiles are collected of the sample in the diamond container after recovering from the assembly, which reduces the number of parameters (𝜌 𝐴 𝜇 𝐴 = 0 and 𝑟 𝐴,𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 0). The parameters are fitted to the measurements by a nonlinear least squares regression procedure (text F). Below, we describe the specific procedure of fitting these parameters to the absorption profiles collected at ambient conditions (section 2.2) and in situ (section 2.3) in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Fitting of parameters to X-ray absorption profiles that are collected at ambient conditions</head><p>Because it is assumed that samples recovered from experiments of the same starting composition have the same density at ambient conditions (section 3 of this text) and because 𝜇 𝑆 only depends on composition, it follows that 𝜌 𝑆,0 𝜇 𝑆 are identical among samples with the same starting composition. As a consequence, 𝜌 𝑆,0 𝜇 𝑆 needs to be determined by fitting Beer-Lambert formulations to all profiles at ambient pressure that are collected on samples that share their starting composition in a single fit. To reduce the number of free parameters, parameters 𝐿, 𝐶, and 𝑟 𝐴,𝑜𝑢𝑡 are also assumed identical among ambient absorption profiles collected from samples with the same starting composition. In practice, the diameter of the post-experimental assembly (𝑟 𝐴,𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) can vary between experiments as a result of the different amounts of vertical compression that experimental assemblies have been exposed to. However, by fitting individual values of 𝜌 𝐴 𝜇 𝐴 to each absorption profile, variations in the characteristics of assembly material per experiment are sufficiently considered. Parameters 𝜌 𝐷 𝜇 𝐷 and 𝑟 𝐷,𝑜𝑢𝑡 are allowed to have different value per experiment, but these are assumed equal among the D+S+A and D+S absorption profiles of an identical experiment, because we do not expect the diamond to deform at ambient conditions by removing it from the assembly. Separate values of 𝑟 𝑆,𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑟 𝐷,𝑖𝑛 and of 𝑥 0 are fitted to each absorption profile.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the fit to the D+S+A and D+S ambient pressure absorption data of exp5, exp6 and exp7, which are performed with identical starting material (Fe-17wt%Si). As described above, parameters 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 , 𝐿, 𝐶, and 𝑟 𝐴,𝑜𝑢𝑡 are considered constant among the profiles (four parameters), separate values for 𝜌 𝐴 𝜇 𝐴 are fitted to each of the three D+S+A profiles (three parameters), separate values of 𝜌 𝐷 𝜇 𝐷 and 𝑟 𝐷,𝑜𝑢𝑡 are fitted to profiles of each experiments but are considered to be equal among D+S+A and D+S absorption profiles of the identical experiment (six parameters), and for each of the six absorption profiles, individual parameters of 𝑟 𝑆,𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑟 𝐷,𝑖𝑛 and 𝑥 0 are adopted (twelve parameters). In total, 25 parameters are simultaneously fitted to the six absorption profiles.</p><p>An enhanced absorption due to the MgO-Pt calibrant mixture that is placed at the outside of the diamond is detected in the D+S+A absorption profiles (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Additional outliers are present in the D+S absorption profile of Exp5, which are potentially due to traces of MgO-Pt powder that may have remained at the outside of the diamond after removing the diamond and sample from the assembly. These datapoints are excluded from the fitting because the absorption of calibrant powder is not modelled.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> lists the estimates of 𝜌 𝑆,0 𝜇 𝑆 at post-situ ambient conditions and the formal fitting errors.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows all ambient-pressure absorption profiles together with the fitted profiles.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Fitting of parameters to X-ray absorption profiles that are collected in situ</head><p>In many of the experiments performed in this study, we collected several absorption profiles directly after each other at separate altitudes through the sample at high pressure and superliquidus temperature (PT) conditions. We assume that 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 is identical among such PT absorption profiles of a single experiment because these absorption profiles are collected at identical pressure and temperature conditions. Accordingly, we estimate model parameters of the separate PT absorption profiles of an individual experiment in a single fit. Values of 𝐿, 𝐶, 𝑟 𝐴,𝑜𝑢𝑡 , 𝑟 𝐴,𝑖𝑛𝑛 = 𝑟 𝐷,𝑜𝑢𝑡 , and 𝜌 𝐷 𝜇 𝐷 are taken from Beer-Lambert fits to the ambient pressure absorption profiles of corresponding experiment, because these parameters are difficult to constrain from the PT absorption profiles. This is a reasonable assumption because the diamond capsule is far less compressible than the MgO, BN and boron epoxy parts that make up the assembly. We do consider individual values of 𝜌 𝐴 𝜇 𝐴 , 𝑥 0 and 𝑟 𝐷,𝑖𝑛𝑛 = 𝑟 𝑆,𝑜𝑢𝑡 for each of the PT absorption profiles. For several experiments, absorption profiles taken at a different altitude through the sample show significant differences in the inner radius of the diamond container (𝑟 𝐷,𝑖𝑛𝑛 = 𝑟 𝑆,𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) which are likely related to deformation (e.g. bulging) of the inner part of the diamond cylinder under the applied vertical pressure. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> presents two such in situ absorption profiles of exp7, which are taken at a slightly different altitude trough the assembly.</p><p>The difference in the amplitude and width of absorption features that are induced by the sample is completely ascribed to different inner radii of the diamond (0.2564 mm versus 0.2462mm) at the separate altitudes at which the profiles are collected.</p><p>The estimates of 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 at PT conditions are listed in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the collected data and Beer-Lambert fits of all PT absorption profiles.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Hydrostatic Weighing</head><p>The density of recovered samples (𝜌 𝑆,0 ) is measured by hydrostatic weighing (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Neuville, 2006)</ref> in diiodomethane liquid at the Institute de Physique du Globe Paris (IPGP) in Paris, France. By the principle of Archimedes, the density of the recovered sample is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝜌 𝑆,0 = 𝜌 𝑙 𝑚 𝑎 𝑚 𝑎 -𝑚 𝑙 , (<label>𝐴6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>with 𝜌 𝑙 the density of the liquid, 𝑚 𝑎 the apparent mass of the sample in air and 𝑚 𝑙 the apparent mass of the sample immersed in the liquid. The temperature of diiodomethane was measured at 30.6 °C by a mercury thermometer and did not vary between the measurements by more than 0.2 °C. Diiodomethane liquid has a density (𝜌 𝑙 ) of 3.2935 g•cm -3 at this temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Griffing et al., 1954)</ref>. A high-precision balance of 10 -5 g resolution is used to measure 𝑚 𝑎 and 𝑚 𝑙 . The precision limit of the balance propagates to a maximum accuracy on 𝜌 𝑆,0 of ~ ± 0.2 g•cm -3 on our single samples of ~ 50•10 -5 g. To increase the precision of the density measurement, we assume that recovered samples from the same starting composition have the same density. We weigh the sets of samples that shared the starting composition as an ensemble. Samples of Exp2, Exp5, Exp7 and Exp9 have unfortunately been lost during the weighing process, and their densities are assumed equal to the average density that is measured on recovered samples that shared the starting composition. The results of the hydrostatic weighing are summarized in table <ref type="table">A2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Pressure and temperature conditions</head><p>The pressure and temperature conditions of the measurements at experimental (PT) conditions are determined by crossings of the isochores that correspond to the unit cell volumes of the Pt and BN calibrant materials. These unit cell volumes are derived from in-situ collected X-ray absorption spectra of the Pt and BN. The equation of states of Pt from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Fei et al. (2007)</ref> and of BN from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Wakabayashi and Funamori (2015)</ref> are used to compute the isochores (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Expected uncertainties on the isochore crossings are ± 0.5 GPa and ± 150 K.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Knibbe, 2020)</ref>. Pressure and temperature are estimated by isochore crossings using equation of states of Pt from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Fei et al. (2007)</ref> and of BN from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Wakabayashi and Funamori (2015)</ref>. For Exp6 and Exp7, the listed lattice parameters correspond to calibrant spectra taken at subliquidus conditions, because the spectra at the superliquidus conditions of the absorption measurements did not provide a good Pt signal. Temperature is extrapolated to the absorption measurement conditions by assuming an increase of temperature that is proportional to the applied electrical power. The Pt signals were also absent for Exp11 and Exp13, for which we assume identical sample pressure as Exp5 and Exp9, respectively, based on the similar power, oil pressure and BN lattice parameter. Temperatures of Exp11 and Exp13 are power-corrected relative to the temperatures Exp5 and Exp9.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Uncertainties</head><p>We tested the sensitivity of our results to modelling assumptions by trial and error and noticed that the formal fitting errors (table 1) are poor indicators of the accuracy of 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 . For example, the estimate of 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 corresponding to ambient-pressure absorption data of Exp5, Exp6, and Exp7 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) is 3509 m -1 with a formal standard error of 3 m -1 . When we fix the width of the beam (𝐿) to the slits-controlled dimension of 0.1 mm instead of fitting 𝐿 to the data, an estimate for 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 of 3560 m -1 with a formal standard error of 4 m -1 is obtained. We have more confidence in the fitted estimate of 𝐿, which is consistently estimated at 0.06-0.07 mm for the acquired data in this study. The difference between the fitted value of 𝐿 and the slits-controlled target value is on the order of the precision on the calibration of the slit-window (normally ±0.02 mm at this beamline), such that a smaller beam width compared to the target value is possible. The corresponding difference in the fitting result indicates that model assumptions, instead of fitting errors, dominate the actual uncertainties on 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 . By testing the influence of this and several other model assumptions, the obtained estimates of 𝜌 𝑆 𝜇 𝑆 vary by up to ~ 2 %. For this reason,</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
