<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5HSRUW</head><p>The main proposer was in maternity leaves at the time of the experiment. The beamtime was used by the other users of the four experiments mentionned above. Concerning the mechanisms of Zn hyperaccumulation in $UDELGRSVLV KDOOHUL, an article has been published, based on EXAFS data obtained during previous experiments: Sarret, G., <ref type="bibr">Saumitou-Laprade, P., Bert, V., Proux, O., Hazemann, J. L., Traverse, A., Marcus, M. A. and Manceau A. (2002)</ref> Forms of zinc accumulated in the hyperaccumulator $UDELGRSVLV KDOOHUL. 3ODQW 3K\VLRORJ\ 130: 1815-1826.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>$EVWUDFW</head><p>The chemical forms of zinc in the Zn tolerant and hyperaccumulator $UDELGRSVLV KDOOHUL and in the non-tolerant and nonaccumulator $UDELGRSVLV O\UDWD ssp SHWUDHD were determined at the molecular level by combining chemical analyses, extended Xray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS), synchrotron-based X-ray microfluorescence (µSXRF) and µEXAFS. Plants were grown in hydroponics with various Zn concentrations, and $ KDOOHUL specimens growing naturally in a contaminated site were also collected. Zn speciation in $ KDOOHUL was independent of the origin of the plants (contaminated or non-contaminated) and Zn exposure. In aerial parts, Zn was predominantly octahedrally coordinated and complexed to malate. A secondary organic species was identified in the bases of the trichomes, which contained elevated Zn concentrations, and in which Zn was tetrahedrally coordinated and complexed to carboxyl and/or hydroxyl functional groups. This species was detected thanks to the good resolution and sensitivity of µSXRF and µEXAFS. In the roots of $ KDOOHUL grown in hydroponics, Zn phosphate was the only species detected, and is believed to result from chemical precipitation on the root surface. In the roots of $ KDOOHUL grown on the contaminated soil, Zn was distributed in Zn malate, Zn citrate, and Zn phosphate. Zn phosphate was present in both the roots and aerial part of $ O\UDWD ssp. SHWUDHD. This study illustrates the complementarity of bulk and spatially resolved techniques, allowing the identification of (1) the predominant chemical forms of the metal, and (2) the minor forms present in particular cells, both types of information being essential for a better understanding of the bioaccumulation processes.</p></div>		</body>
