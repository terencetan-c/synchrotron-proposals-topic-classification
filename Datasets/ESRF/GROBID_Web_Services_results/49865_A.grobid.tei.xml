<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Structural evolution of framboidal poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) -poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate) -poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PGMA 63 -PHPMA 350 -PBzMA x , where x = 0 -373) triblock copolymer vesicles during RAFT emulsion polymerization were analyzed by SAXS technique. The obtained samples corresponding to different stages of the synthesis were diluted from about 20wt% to 1wt% water solutions before the SAXS measurements. Two SAXS camera length settings (10 m and 3 m), covering qrange from 0.01 nm -1 to 0.2 nm -1 , were used for the measurements. A capillary flow through cell for liquids was used for the measurements. FReLoN Kodak 2D CCD detector was used for recordings. Pronounced form factor oscillations of intensities associated with vesicle membrane thickness are observed in SAXS patterns (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Increasing amount of hydrophobic PBzMA component in the block copolymer causes shift of the form factor peaks towards small q-values indicating that the thickness of the vesicle membrane increases accordingly. The scattering form factor of block copolymer vesicles comprising a homogeneous membrane core and corona chains [1] produced a good fit to the sample corresponding to initial PGMA 63 -PHPMA 350 diblock copolymer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, red circles). The obtained parameters were consistent with the expected self-assembled structure of vesicles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) composed of a homogeneous poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate) membrane core and poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) corona. However, this vesicle model failed to describe scattering patterns corresponding to PGMA 63 -PHPMA 350 -PBzMA 373 triblock copolymers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, green triangles) demonstrating framboidal morphology with a phase separated membrane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). A poor vesicle model fit to the experimental SAXS patterns corresponding to the framboidal triblock copolymer vesicles suggests that extra structural components describing the membrane morphology should be counted in the model and, therefore, the data analysis requires a further consideration. Following the microscopy data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) three different approaches for the improvement of the vesicle model are currently under analysis. As one of the approaches it is assumed that the membrane core is composed of three layers and the whole membrane cross-section can be represented as PGMA corona-PHPMA-PBzMA-PHPMA-PGMA corona. Another approach is that the scattering patterns can be described by a two-population model <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> where the first population represents vesicles with a smooth membrane core surrounded by a corona and the second population represents spherical formation of poly(benzyl methacrylate) in the membrane described by a form-and structure-factor of packed spherical particles. And one more approach is based on the same two-population model where the second population is described by a form-and structure-factor of packed micelles formed by phase-separated PBzMA and PHPMA blocks.  A stopped-flow apparatus was used for the second part of our SAXS experiments to follow the dissociation of biocompatible pH-responsive amphiphilic block copolymer nanoparticles caused by the pH change (from pH 8 to pH 5) that occurs on short time scales after mixing solutions of a polymer with hydrochloric acid. The block copolymer nanoparticles were based on biocompatible hydrophilic 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), pH-sensitive 2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (DPA) and non pH-sensitive hydrophobic 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) monomers. The structural changes upon pH change in solutions of a series of pH-responsive PMPC 19 -b-PDPA 900 and PMPC 19 -b-P(HPMA 450 -s-DPA x ) nanoparticles were tested by both time-resolved and static SAXS experiments. As a control, the non pH-sensitive PMPC 19 -b-PHPMA 450 block copolymer nanoparticles were also tested. Time-resolved SAXS confirmed that the pH-responsive PMPC 19 -b-P(HPMA 450 -s-DPA 450 ) amphiphilic block copolymer nanoparticles dissociate to unimers approximately after 3.5 seconds of mixing the polymer solution (2% w/w pH 7-8) with 0.1M hydrochloric acid solution. We are currently developing a model for SAXS analysis that will give us insights into the mechanism by which these nanoparticles dissociate to unimers. References: 1.
