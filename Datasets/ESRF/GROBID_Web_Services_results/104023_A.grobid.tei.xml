<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Preliminary report: The experiment was successful. We measured on two types of compounds: Bi-and Sb-based materials as anode materials in Na-ion batteries. There were some minor issues at the start of our experiment (luggage with all samples was lost by the airline), but we managed to make up for lost time.</p><p>Bi-based materials (Bi2MoO6 and BiFeO3): We extensively measured ex situ samples of BiFeO3 and Bi2MoO6 at different stages of (dis)charge in capillaries using XRD, PDF, and XAS (with full EXAFS region, Bi-and Mo-edge). We were also able to successfully measure the combined quasi-simultaneous operando PDF/EXAFS on Bi2MoO6 as anode in NIB using the electrochemical cell equipped with glassy carbon windows (see Drozhzhin et al (doi: 10.1107/S1600577517017489 ) for cell design). The data is still currently being analysed, but our preliminary results</p><p>show that we are able to gain a deeper understanding of Bi2MoO6 and a manuscript is in progress Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11￼</ref>).</p><p>Operando XRD of BiFeO3 at high cycling rate (1000 mA g -1 , approx. 2C) was also collected at this beamtime, and we are including this dataset in a publication Figure 22￼  Sb-based materials (Sb2Se3, Sb2Se3/Sb, and Sb2S3): We spent the better part of a day to get our cells working properly (see description above). However, when we managed to sort out our electrochemistry problems, we measured 3 x operando PDF/XAS (Sb-edge) simultaneously with current densities of either 100 mA g -1 or 1000 mA g -1 . In all, we have 6 number of operando PDF/XAS datasets successfully collected of Sb2X3. An example of the operando XRD of Sb2Se3 is given in the figure below. Converting analysis of the PDF are still ongoing for all collected data.</p><p>In all operando PDF experiments, there are significant amounts of copper current collector and Na sampled along with the active material. This causes problems with the PDF analysis as the crystalline copper dominates the PDF, but we have implemented methods for removing crystalline Cu and Na peaks from the diffractograms. Furthermore, the use of thin electrodes for Sb2X3 means that difference PDF is the method of choice for analysis of the data as the changes between the individual PDF scans are extremely small. However, SNBL has developed a new, user-friendly electrochemical cell (BASSET cell) where we can shoot the beam only at the top of the electrode (thus, only including PDF of interested active material part), instead of shooting the beam through the whole battery stack. This has the potential of limiting Cu and Na domination in the PDF. Sb2Se3/Sb was tested in this cell. The electrodes of Sb2Se3/Sb might have been too thin, so that we are hitting some crystalline copper current collector in addition to the active material (see figure below). We conclude that more investigations are highly necessary for the BaSSET cell, where optimization of the cell design (currently working on) to improve the electrochemical performance and optimization of the electrode preparation are main objectives for further developing this cell.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Amalie Skurtveit*, Anders Brennhagen*, Erlend T.
