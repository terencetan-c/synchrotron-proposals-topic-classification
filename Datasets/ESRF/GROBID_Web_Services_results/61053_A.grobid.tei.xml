Assimilation products such as sugars and starch, and minerals from leaves, and water and nutrients from roots are transported by phloem and xylem, respectively. These are thought to be transported in radially by living cell such as parenchyma cells <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. This aspects are generally accepted and proposed in many text books, although there are no experimental data that parenchyma cells are the exact place of chemical transportation. The experimentation on standing trees is difficult, because the phenomena occur inside the tree trunk.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to reveal the site of mneral transport from phloem to xylem of trees for understanding the nineral transportation mechanism in tree trunk. We have analyzed the mineral distribution using frozen-hydrated tree samples which were injected Cs as a tracer into the trees (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In this experiment, we analyzed the sub-micron level element mapping of Cs (µ-XRF) to reveal the mineral pathway from phloem to xylem via cambium using frozen-hydrated tree samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(Experimental design)</head><p>We use stable isotope cesium (Cs) as a tracer. Cs is a homologous element with potassium that is an essential mineral element in plants. Thus, we expect that Cs moves similarly to potassium. Cs is injected into trunks (ca. 15 cm in diameter) of standing Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) trees for 1day. Since chemicals in standing trees are of in wet condition, we use a unique sampling procedure to reveal the element distribution in a standing tree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Trunk part of a standing tree is frozen by liquid nitrogen for 20 minutes, and then cut down.</p><p>Frozen samples are cut into small pieces in a liquid nitrogen pool and kept frozen until the end of the analysis [3].</p><p>We used 4 areas of different distance from injection point (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>), since our preliminary results from cryo-SEM/EDX and ICP-MS analyses showed that Cs concentration was different from the distance from the injection point. Frozen block of the tree sample was cut into small blocks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>), and transverse, tangential, radial thinsections were prepared by using of cryomicrotme (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>), and subjected to the cryo-µ-XRF analysis. The details of the setting was decided based on the correspondence with beam line scientist (Dr. Castillo-Michel at ID21), such as a submicrometric beam (~0.3µm ver. x 0.7µm hor.). We conducted low resolution analysis for 1 h, and then high relosution analysis (100 x 100µm, at dwell times of 100-200 ms with step size about 1 µm) multiplied by 30 scan (final scanned area was 300µm x 1 mm).</p><p>(Results and discussion)</p><p>The results are presently being analyzed.</p><p>Our experimts mainly conducted using transverse sections. We obtained elemental mappings of cryo-µ-XRF in this experiment (Figs. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref>). We compared the images among the difference of section thickness, and decided to use 15µm thickness section for the analysis.</p><p>We used the area a as a control, where Cs had low concentration as same as no-injected tree sample detected by ICP-MS analysis (our unpublished data). Cs was not detected in the area a, although potassium (K) and calsium (Ca) represented cell structure and phosphate (P) represented living cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). On the other hand, Cs was clearly detected in the areas b, c, and d (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The results indicated that Cs distributed in the cell walls of all types of cells such as tracheids and parenchyma cells. The results of this experiment showed some similarity and some differences between Cs and K distribution. To unravel these properties, we need to conduct further analysis. In addition to the transverse sections, we obtained mapping of tangential and radial surface. Unfortunately, because of the limit of the beam time, we analyzed only one scan in each of tangential and radial section. These results also indicate that Cs distributed in the cell walls of all types of cells, although one mapping was not enough to arouse conclusion. However, we conclude that these 3 dimensional data seem crucial to understand the spatial distribution of minerals.</p><p>In the submitted proposal of this experiment, we proposed the XANES analysis to investigate Cs speciation (identify movable vs bound to the cell structure). In this experiment, however, the XANES analysis was not performed because our first experiment preference was given to XRF mapping. The chemical form of Cs analyzed by µ-XANES in frozen-hydrated tree samples will be needed to unravel the mechanism of mineral distribution in standing trees.</p><p>In our ongoing study, we have analyzed the mineral distribution using frozen-hydrated tree samples by cryo-SEM/EDX. We obtained the cesium distribution by point analysis, but not obtained subcellular elemental images because of technical problems. In this experiment at ESRF ID21, we succeeded to obtain Cs mapping in the cryo-µ-XRF analysis, which helps us to understand the details of the cesium transportation mechanism in the trees. These data are also important to reveal how the trees were contaminated by radiocesium after Fukushima nuclear power plant accident in Japan <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, and to predict the future distribution of radiocesium in trees. (Extra) During our experiment, it was honour to be introduced our experiment at "weekendusers".
