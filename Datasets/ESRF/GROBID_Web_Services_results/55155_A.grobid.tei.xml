<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural evolution of the ionic phases of ammonia monohydrate at high pressure</head><p>Experiment number: HC1646 Beamline: ID27 Date of experiment: from: 28 octobre 2014 to: 04 novembre 2014 Date of report: Shifts: 12 Local contact(s): G. Garbarino Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Sandra NINET -IMPMC -Paris Frédéric DATCHI -IMPMC-Paris Jean-Antoine QUEYROUX -IMPMC -Paris Cailong LIU -IMPMC -Paris Report:</p><p>Despite its high relevance for planetary physics, in particular giant icy planets, the properties of ammonia/water compounds are totally unknown above 10 GPa. The aim of this proposal was to study the structural properties (EOS and structure) and P-T boundaries of the 1:1 compound (ammonia monohydrate or AMH) over a wide range of pressure at low and ambient temperature. Previously, a theoretical work predicted a full ionization of AMH in a tetragonal structure only composed of NH 4 + and OH -ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Using infrared spectroscopy, we have detected a molecular/ionic phase transition and the presence of OH-and NH 4 + species above 8 GPa at ambient temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the signature of NH 3 and H 2 O molecules were still present. The structure and stability of this partially ionic phase at high pressure and low temperature was unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results :</head><p>We have studied 4 different samples of AMH. The samples were loaded and compressed at 80 K to pressures greater than 10 GPa before warming up to room T in order to keep the 1:1 composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The Raman spectra of all samples confirmed the presence of ionic species after loading. The first sample was decompressed from 27 GPa at 300 K to determine the phase transition sequence between the ionic and molecular phases. Figure <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref> shows the evolution of the integrated x-ray pattern from 15 GPa at 300 K. Down to 8.2 GPa, the x-ray pattern can be indexed by a bcc structure, as reported for AMH-VI (the disordered molecular alloy, or DMA, phase) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Below this pressure, we observed a sequence of phase transitions at the same pressures as observed by infrared spectroscopy: at 7.15 GPa, the bcc peaks broaden and decompose into several peaks at 6.7 GPa. At 5 GPa, the pattern can be indexed with AHH-II and another, unidentified phase. At 4 GPa, the spectrum can be interpreted by the coexistence of AHH-II and ice VII, as in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. At 3.1 GPa, the sample is fluid.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b) shows a high quality pattern collected at 12 GPa. As can be seen in the inset of figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>(a), the x-ray pattern of the ionic phase differs from the predicted ionic tetragonal structure. A Rietveld refinement using the BCC structure proposed for AMH-VI <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> provides a very good fit, suggesting that the ionic phase can be described by the same substitutionally and rotationally disordered structure as AMH-VI. The same x-ray pattern is observed up to 80 GPa, from 5 to 300K, showing that this phase is stable in this large P-T range. We determined the EOS of AMH from 2 samples up to respectively 35 GPa and 80 GPa at ambient temperature.</p><p>We have also explored the phase diagram of AMH at low T below 15 GPa. Our goal was to determine the influence of the followed thermodynamic pathway on the structure of the AMH sample. The results are depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. On cooling a sample of AMH-VI at 13 GPa (purple thermodynamic pathways in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), no phase transition was observed down to 2 GPa at 200 K. At this pressure, the pattern changed: news peaks appear, some of which can be indexed with AMH-II but not all. Phase III is never observed. On recompression, the x-pattern is gradually modified when reaching the stability range of AMH-IV but its structure remains unknown. The bcc DMA phase appears again at 6.4 GPa -270 K, where it coexists with the low pressure phase. Finally, at 7.4 GPa-300 K, the pure bcc phase is observed. With another sample, we cooled the liquid at 0.2 GPa (green thermodynamic pathways in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We did not observe the crystallization in AMH-I down to 80 K but obtained an amorphous phase which persisted up to 10 GPa at 80 K. The crystallization in the DMA phase was again observed by warming the sample above 200 K at 12 GPa.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>This run allowed us to determine the structure of AMH over a large range of P-T conditions: 0.2-80 GPa, 5-300 K. Above 7.5 GPa at room T, the x-ray pattern is always best described by the bcc structure of AMH-VI. The ordered P4/mnm ionic structure predicted by DFT is never observed, even at low T. This shows that the substitutional disorder is maintained even in the partially ionic sample. Following this run, we performed new ab initio calculations which confirm that ionicity is compatible with the disordered structure. Publication of these results is underway <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
