Two different resolution size were chosen: 3.5 and 1.5µm to visualize respectively the vascularization and the cells in the bones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results:</head><p>The experiment permit to:</p><p>1) Visualize qualitatively the vascularization in sauropod (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>) at the two different resolution. The 3.5µm permit to visualize the vascularity along all the bone cortex. Different regions of interest through the bone cortex were selected and scanned at a 1.5µm resolution size 2) Visualize the bones cells (osteocyte lacunae) in the different taxa studied and quantify their volume and density (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). 3) Quantify the vascularization segmented in the taxa studied: size, orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Virtual 3D reconstruction of the vascularization in an adult sauropod bone and corresponding vascular orientation analysis; radial canals are in red, longitudinal ones in blue, and oblique ones in green.</p><p>Congress abstract:</p><p>Results will be presented at the ICVM-11 (International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology)in Washington USA (29 th June to 3 rd July) Maïtena Dumont, Anthony Herrel , Paul Tafforeau, Sophie Sanchez. Walking with giants: is the cortical bone structure and vascularization adapted to load bearing in large terrestrial vertebrates?</p><p>The cortical bone of long bones is perforated by vascular canals. This interconnected network is an integral component of the bone microstructure and undergoes continual change throughout life. Bone remodelling will affect the vascular organization, i.e. its size, volume and orientation. The external loads experienced by the long bones will shape the cortical microarchitecture. Sauropods are an ideal group to study this question because of their great body mass and late ontogenetic remodelling. We used propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography to precisely characterize and quantify the vascular cortex organization of the long bones of sauropods in 3D. The vascular volume, orientation, and connectivity were used to understand the impact of growth and bone remodeling on bone integrity. Sauropods present in their early stages of development, a peculiar laminar vascular organization made of longitudinal "plates". This organization is kept in periphery at the adult stage where a decrease of the cortical porosity goes along with a narrowing of the longitudinal plate and a consecutive enlargement of the radial canals. The late bone remodeling observed in adult sauropods results in a reduction of the canal size and generates a more tubular longitudinal architecture, similar to large mammals' long bone. These vascular organization are discussed in a growth development and mechanical perspective. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Virtual 3D of the vascularization of a juvenile sauropod bone (A) compared to an adult one (B).
