When used by artists, its paint has been observed to degrade with time, known as "ultramine sickness," causing not only shifts in aesthetic value but also structural weakening of the paint. Our research aims to identify the mechanism of such degradation so that we may ultimately determine a means for better preserving works containing ultramarine blue. We hypothesize that the ultramarine pigment has catalytic properties that cause this degradation phenomenon, possibly enhanced by the presence of the polysulfide radical, S 3  -. We are interested in determining if a relationship exsist between pigment preparation and the state of degradation, as historical records describe various methods of pigment preparation. Sulfur K-edge XANES was chosen to investigate the sulfur speciation of the ultramarine that have been influence by the preparatory methods (and their potential relation to degradation). As according to literature, there is a correlation between heat treatment, the blue hue, and sulfur speciation. We studied pigment particles prepared using four different heat treatments (i.e. no heat, 415, 600, and 750 ˚C) before grinding and purification and those found in historical paint samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Sulfur K-edge XANES spectra (fluorescence mode; macrobeam) were gathered on the four heat-treated samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). Just as described in the literature for heat-treated lazurite, we see a change in the spectral shape with heat. There is a significant increase in the intensity of peaks at 2468.7 and 2470.7 eV with increasing temperature. Based on discussions of peak assignments in the literature <ref type="bibr">(Gambardella, et al. Microchem. J. 2016, 125, 299;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pascal, et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2015, 17,7743)</ref>, the peak enhancements at 2470.7 eV can be attributed to an increase in the relative amount of the trisulfur radical. Because the trisulfur radical is proposed as responsible for the blue color, this result is also consistent with the color changes observed from heating, with higher temperatures producing stronger hues. Interestingly, the major peaks (2470.7 eV) of our samples heated to high temperatures are different from those previously reported. This can be explained by the fact that the sulfur speciation is dependent on the atmosphere/time of heat treatment.</p><p>To identify whether a heat-treatment may have been used historically in ultramarine pigment preparation, we analyzed 3 historical paintings (6 samples prepared as cross-sections). The sample of a Paulus Potter painting was taken from an area observed to be relatively intact ultramarine while that of a Jan Steen painting was from an area showing degradation. Prior to collecting XANES spectra, however, it was first necessary to perform micro-XRF measurements on each sample to identify the location of ultramarine pigment particles in the hetreogenous paint layers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>). XANES spectra (fluorescence mode; microbeam) were subsequently gathered on such selected particles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>), specifically utilizing the microbeam to remain localized solely on ultramarine. The spectral profiles indeed relate to those from the heat-treated samples with the spectra of the Potter sample (red trace) and the Steen sample (blue trace) most like those of the 750 ˚C and non-heated samples, respectively. Significantly, these relationships suggest that paint containing pigment heat-treated to 750 ˚C is less susceptible to degradation than that containing unheated pigment. Such a discovery motivates the need for further studies of historical paint samples.</p><p>In addition to these generally positive results, there were a few obstacles faced during the measurements that complicate the interpretation of the data described above. Notably, issues arose relating to beam damage when employing analyses with a microbeam (e.g. for all analyses of the historical samples). For instance, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> presents spectra gathered from the unheated pigment sample with either the microbeam (red trace) or the macrobeam (blue trace). Beam damage is recognizable by the appearance of a peak at 2478.0 eV, attributed to sulfite formation; this type of beam damage is not uncommon in sulfur Kedge XANES as sulfate is susceptible to photoreduction. When exposed to the microbeam, a peak at 2470.7 eV also becomes prominent relative to the spectral shape observed using the macrobeam. Importantly, this newly produced peak is at the same peak position as the peak defining differences between the heated and unheated samples measured solely with the macrobeam (recall Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>). Such an artifact also hinders our interpretation of spectra from the historical samples, which were only measured with the microbeam and produce relatively intense sulfite peaks. Lastly, the detection of these artifacts in the pigment samples were not consistent from particle to particle suggesting an inherent heterogeneity within and between the pigment particles due to sulfur speciation and associated minerals. The avoidance of beam damage and characterization of heterogeneity would be best achieved employing full-field XANES on thin sections of embedded paint samples.
