<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Using the "4 bunch" mode of the ESRF we have investigated the potential of XMaS to provide a viable resource for the study of materials and their behaviour from the perspective of "soft" K edges such as Cl and 4d transition metal L 3 edges edges such as Rh.</p><p>Our preliminary results show that XMaS can provide a highly useful resource for studies of this nature (which span disciplines from physics, and materials science to chemistry and biology), and one that may yet be further optimised. We note that resources actively dealing with this spectroscopic energy regime are in some deficit worldwide.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction.</head><p>The state, whereabouts, and function of elements such as P, S, and Cl in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis is relatively poorly understood: this situation goes well beyond catalysis these elements being ubiquitous in many areas of soft condensed matter, geosciences, and biology.</p><p>In many catalyst formulations these elements may be found and are well known to modify the nature and performance of these materials in both advantageous and deleterious ways: sulphur and phosphorous are for instance well known poisons in the petrochemical and automobile exhaust arenas.</p><p>In the current cases Cl has been shown to influence the atomic dispersion of Rh, catalytic reactivity, and has been long implicated in the oxidative disruption of small Rh nanoparticles by gases such as CO. Yet the details of how and why this happens remain largely unknown as suitable probes to study these effects are few and far between.</p><p>Cl is also often to be found as a counter ligand to homogenous transition metal complexes research for catalysing a plethora of chemical conversions in the liquid phase: similarly however, the precise role this ligand may be playing in the desired chemistry, or indeed undesirable aspects such as catalyst deactivation, are far from well understood. Soft X-ray XAFS potentially provides a means to investigate the speciation and structure of such elements in both ex-situ and, more importantly, in operando manners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental.</head><p>A previously existing vacuum apparatus and highT/lowT cryostat was used to mount powder samples, a Vortex fluorescence detector, a dosing system for volatile organo-metallics, and a gas line for the exposure of samples to H 2 and CO.</p><p>Samples were mounted within this system either using conductive carbon tape to stick the samples to an existing Cu stub, or suspended in isopropanol before being sprayed (or dropped) onto Al 2 O 3 plates which were then subsequently attached to the Cu stub.</p><p>[Rh(CO) 2 Cl] 2 was sublimed in situ onto Î³-Al 2 O 3 (Johnson Matthey) previously sprayed onto the Al 2 O 3 plates. By using the variable temperature capacity provided by the cryostat these species could be studied as multilayers (100K) and then progressively as monolayers (at RT) and then in situ as they were expose to H 2 and eventually to CO up to a temperature of ca. 613K*</p></div>
