<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>-Overview:</p><p>We acquired movies of recombinant vaults from Dictoystelium discoideum in gold grids using the FEI Titan Krios electron microscope in counting mode with EPU at x130000 (pixel size of 1.05 Å/pixel). We used an electron dose of 7.2 electrons/pixel/second and each movie contains 30 frames recorded in 6 seconds. The whole dataset has 2525 movies.</p><p>-Quality of data:</p><p>The movies collected present a high heterogenity in the particle distribution, showing regions completely crowded of particles and regions with just very few particles. Also the particle itself presents structural heterogenity due to the presence of half-and full-particles or opening intermediates in the same area. These facts, joined to the big size of the particle (700 Å), limit the number of particles available per movie (FIGURE <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The quality of the images is considerably high, reaching the 2.9 Å resolution in the CTF estimation (FIGURE <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>-Status and progress of evaluation A total of 103546 particles were automatically picked with 700 x 700 box size in pixel and extracted with a pixel size of 1.05 Å. All particles were subjected for RELION 3.0 to twodimensional (FIGURE <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and three-dimensional classification. 12150 particles were selected, joined to the 18032 particles selected in the first acquisition of this project (MX-2018) and refined together using C3 symmetry (the lowest symmetry present in the particle). To enhance signal, the mask is generated from cryoEM data to focus the refinement in the vault region. Following "gold standard" refinement protocol, the current reconstructed map (FIGURE <ref type="figure">3</ref>) has been obtained to 3.85 Å of resolution.</p><p>-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Dictyostelium discoideum contains two MVP isoforms: MVPα and MVPβ and both proteins are required for the structural integrity of the vault particle. Our main goal was to decipher howe these two iosoforms are organised to conform the vault particle of Dictyostelium. We considered two possible scenarios: the D39 dihedral symmetry is conserved and each halve of the particle is composed of 39 copies of MVPα and MVPβ respectively or vaults from D. discoideum present a unique architecture with both isoforms intercalating in each vault half and thus exhibiting a new rotational symmetry. As mentioned above, the processing of the data we have collected has resulted in a 3.85 Å map where we were able to trace the main chain of the MVP monomers and many of the bulky side chains . Unfortunately, we were not able to distinguish between the two MVP monomers,  and , forming this particle. Now we are carrying out several software approximations using masks with the objective to solve this problem.</p><p>Additionally, some experiments have been planned with the objective to be able to distinguish the two monomers. We are going to fuse a peptide that is recognised by a commercial nanobody to one of the monomers. The complex nanobody-particle let us identify the position of these monmers in the assembly of the vault. Once we will have this information, we will be able to solve the structure.</p></div>			</div>
