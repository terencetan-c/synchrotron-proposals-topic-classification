<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>Thin films of α-sexithiophene (6T) and C 60 mixtures deposited on nSiO substrates at 303 K and 373 K were investigated in real-time and in situ during the film growth using X-ray diffraction. In the mixtures, the well-known 6T low-temperature crystal phase and the β-phase are observed, which usually coexist in pure 6T films, to a certain extend. The addition of C 60 modifies the structure to almost purely β-phase dominated films in the case of 303 K substrate temperature. On the other hand, at 373 K substrate temperature the low-temperature crystal phase of 6T dominates the film growth of the mixtures. Post-growth annealing of pure 6T films results in strong increase of film ordering, whereas annealing of equimolar 6T:C 60 mixed films does not induce any significant changes in the film structure. These results lend further support to the important influence of C 60 on the growth behaviour and structure formation process of 6T in mixtures of the two materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement and data</head><p>The ID03 beamline is very suitable for interface/surface scattering in situ and in real-time.</p><p>The data are of high quality with a good signal-to-noise ratio in spite of the fact that the scattering signal from the thin organic layers ( ~ 20 nm) is relatively weak. Thanks to the very stable beam and the excellent experimental conditions at the beamline, we were able to measure all samples we aimed for. In order to follow the growth, grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXD) scans were performed during film growth. All the films were characterized post-growth using X-ray reflectivity (XRR), high-resolution GIXD and reciprocal space maps. For the latter, the software BINoculars, provided by the beamline staff was a great support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and Progress of evaluation</head><p>All the data are evaluated and the manuscript "Growth and Annealing Kinetics of α-Sexithiophene and Fullerene C 60 Mixed Films" by the authors C. Lorch, K. Broch, V. Belova, G. Duva, A. Hinderhofer, A. Gerlach, M. Jankowski, and F. Schreiber is submitted to the "Journal of Crystal Growth and Design".</p><p>We would like to thank our local contact Maciej Jankowski and the complete staff of the ID03 beamline for their excellent support. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: 2d reciprocal space maps of six different 6T:C 60 mixtures. In the mixtures prepared at low substrate temperatures (a-c, top row) the peaks of 6T are smeared out and not very well defined. The rings usually seen for C 60 are not observed, since their signals rather low. In the mixtures prepared at high substrate temperature (d-f, bottom row) the 6T peaks are relatively well defined. In the 6T:C 60 (1 : 1) and (1 : 3) mixtures (e and f, respectively), weak rings arising from the C 60 are visible. The images were taken with a MaxiPix area detector and composed of 147 single pictures using the BINoculars software.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,34.10,156.90,527.70,225.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
