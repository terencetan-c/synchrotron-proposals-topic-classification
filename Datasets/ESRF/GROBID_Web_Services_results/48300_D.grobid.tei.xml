<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The few pilot experiments performed at the nano-beam set-up at EH3 of ID13 last June during sc3188 have greatly benefited our experimental approach to the X-ray diffraction of actin filaments in intact stereocilia (auditory villi) from mouse ear organs. Those preliminary experiments showed that it was possible to detect and analyze scattering from this sample type and also, by comparison with the intermediate filament sample experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, that a smooth and reliable substrate for X-ray analysis (like silicon nitride windows) made a great difference in both positioning the sample under the beamline microscope and collecting cleaner and more consistent data. Therefore after sc3188 we focused our efforts in preparing a new set of samples. We modified the tissue extraction and handling protocols to be able to prepare stereocilia from newborn mouse ears and distribute them over the central window of a silicon nitride frame. The stereocilia were then chemically fixed and stained. Each frame was then characterized by fluorescent microscopy and lyophilized in-house. X-ray measurements at EH3 of ID13 for sc3319 were carried out in transmission geometry at a photon energy of 15.26 keV. The beam was focused to 125 x 200 nm² (h x v) using the crossed nano-focusing refractive lens system, yielding a primary beam intensity of ~3x10 9 photons/s. The samples were positioned in the focus of the beam, taking advantage of the high-magnification beamline microscope, the precise sample stage, but also the greatly improved visibility of the sample on the new substrates. After a coarse mesh-scan over a large sample area (not shown), region-of-interest-scans with a small step size on the order of 50 nm were performed, with 1-10 s illumination times. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> shows a dark field image reconstructed from such a mesh scan of mouse stereocilia (elongated structures in the bottom half of the image). A composite image of the diffraction patterns from the inbox (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) shows a high degree of oriented scattering in each diffraction pattern on stereocilia, indicating that diffraction comes predominantly from highly ordered actin inside stereocilia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>, upper and central box, changes in local orientation of the signal could be observed when considering diffraction patterns from different regions or stereocilia, while the bottom box shows almost undetectable orientation for a diffraction pattern corresponding to an empty region on the frame. We are implementing analytical approaches to precisely correlate diffraction, orientation and structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Further steps in analysis will include radial integration of the diffraction patterns to determine intensity maxima corresponding to characteristic length scales or distances in the sample.</p><p>Given the precise and well-prepared setup at ID13/EH3 we were able to successfully obtain very promising data despite the rather short beamtime (18 shifts). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Dr. Valeria Piazza*, Britta Weinhausen*, Christian Olendrowitz* Institute for X-Ray Physics, University of Göttingen</figDesc></figure>
