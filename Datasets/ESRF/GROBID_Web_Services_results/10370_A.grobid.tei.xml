<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to reach the so-called symmetric solid ice X, from ice VII, a sequence of transformations involving the proton site disorder has been proposed. In the various regions l-2-3, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the proton disorder arises respectively from reorientation of the molecules, static disorder of the molecular dipole moments, and proton tunnelling. These modifications with pressure of the proton disorder alter the equation of state. This was shown for ice VII at 300 K. These investigations were performed at the ESRF : in the A membrane diamond anvil cell, placed inside a cryostat, was used with rhenium gaskets.</p><p>We used angular dispersive x-rays with an imaging plate system. We investigated the isothermal paths 200, 50 and 20 K (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The results obtained are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The isothermal paths 200, 50 and 20K were investigated in the pressure range shown in </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>regions 1, 2 and 3 the volume pressure dependences are different. Thus, new lines were added to the phase diagram of ice (Fig. 1). Our present experiment concerns ice VIII. No crystallographic data exist for this phase above 25 GPa, except from our own previous preliminary measurements performed at the ESRF along isothermal paths at 220, 180 and 100 K. The main goals of the present work were the determinations of the transition line from regime 2 to regime 3 for isotherms ~100 K, and the investigation of the EOS of ice at low temperature, around 50 K, in the region of ice VIII and in the regime 3.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. At 200 K the VII-VIII transition was observed around 40 GPa. Along the lower temperature isotherms (50 and 20 K) the obtained diffraction patterns were of poor qualityand did not allow to locate the transition pressures. Actually along this run, and for the three isotherms, we obtained very broad peaks, even in the region of ice VIII where the splitting of the various reflections (due to the tetragonal structure) was not resolved. Strong pressure gradients, observed along these runs, account for that feature : this was checked by the various pressure markers placed close to the center and at the edge of the sample.Typically we measured at e.g. 90 GPa and 50 K, a pressure gradient around 20 GPa. The use of a rhenium gasket may be the cause of this large pressure gradients. Rhenium is very rigid, this favours a zero strain condition along the gasket wall and consequently a large uniaxial stress component. Actually, above 40 GPa, our present data are scattered and not consistent with the previous ones, as shown in Fig.2where the cell volume was computed from the refinement of the various diffraction peaks. Due to these bad results it was not possible to perform further treatments of the data to locate the transitions between regions 2 and 3.</figDesc></figure>
