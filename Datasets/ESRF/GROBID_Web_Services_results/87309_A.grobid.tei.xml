<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>"Kinetics of fundamental steps in methane to methanol conversion using high temperature activated copper hosted in zeolites using Quick XAFS" </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This beamtime, as with that described for exp 31 -01-70 was extremely successful. It should be noted that the success of this experiment is in good part due to Dr Dragos Stoian who went out of his way, and far beyond his local contact remit, in helping the author to get these tricky experiments completed in the time allotted. All 18 shifts, as a result were very effectively used.</p><p>Whereas in exp 31 -01-70 we had concentrated upon Cu/MOR, in this experiment we investigated another promising candidate system for the selective conversion of methane to methanol: Cu/MAZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In this experiment we used Cu K-edge XANES (17 seconds per spectrum) allied to downstream and mass spectrometry (MS) to quantitatively assess all aspects of the high temperature activation step-wise approach to methane conversion to methanol as facilitated by Cu/MAZ. This process requires initial high temperature activation of the zeolite system (723 K, O2) before reaction with methane conducted in the 413 -498 K temperature range. Post reaction with methane the products of that reaction must be steamed from the zeolite before a new reactive cycle can begin. The objective of this time was therefore, as it was for Cu/MOR, in exp 31-01-70, to be able to understand the copper speciation involved throughout the overall step-wise process and investigate the durability of the reactive system over numerous such cycles.</p><p>The results of this beamtime may be summarized as follows:</p><p>(I)</p><p>The kinetics of the reaction of methane with activated Cu/MAZ are, within experimental error the same as found for Cu/MOR and the reaction results in the formation of two spectroscopically discrete Cu(I) centres. In Cu/MAZ, however, a greater variability in the overall extent of reaction (if not the apparent activation energy) was found. (II)</p><p>Steaming of the products in MAZ, and as with Cu/MOR, was also revealed to be a three stage process comprising: (a) zeolite hydration wherein no changes in copper speciation were observed;</p><p>(b) product desorption, wherein the two Cu(I) centres were found to transiently behave in different manners; and, (c) slow re-oxidation of the copper by the water. However, in MAZ one of the Cu(I) species found to be present is shown to be significantly less stable toward re-oxidation by water than its counterpart in MOR which leads to a very different kinetic character to this stage of the process that leads to closure of the reactive cycle. (III) Quantitative cross referencing of the copper speciation observed in time resolved Cu XANES with the products evolved in MS shows that Cu/MAZ is a far more selective for this conversion than Cu/MOR and that virtually no higher oxidation products (such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) are formed by this system. (IV) Subsequent reactive cycling, however, revealed that unlike Cu/MOR Cu/MAZ cannot be quantitatively recycled within the high temperature activation scheme and undergoes systematic degradation in terms of methanol yields achieved. Equally however, the superior selectivity toward methanol and dimethyl ether is retained. (V)</p><p>Whilst this degradative behavior was followed and quantified it also became apparent that Cu Kedge XANES could shed no direct light on the mechanism of the degradation.</p><p>This extremely rich information regarding the behaviour MAZ leads to both positive and negative conclusions regarding this material. On the one had these data clearly show that Cu/MAZ is not a viable material within the conventional reactive protocols applied. However, they also show that if the degradation can be managed, through for instance, adopting different reaction protocols (see also report for 31-01-96 (Knorpp) which has used BM31 to investigate this issue further), then the superior selectivity of MAZ and the reduced stability of one of the Cu ion formed in the stepwise process toward oxidative reactivation could be used to some significant advantage from a process perspective.</p><p>In summary, the combination of time resolved Cu K-edge XANESS and quantitative downstream MS has proved very powerful and extremely informative as to the timescales, speciation, kinetics, and stability of Cu/MAZ in the selective conversion of methane to methanol. The copious results that have resulted from these studies are currently being written up for submission to a high impact journal in the near future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Amy Knorpp Professor Jeroen Van bokhoven Dr Mark Newton* Dr. Ana Pinar Dr. Vitaly Sushkevich* ETJ, Zurich and Paul Scherrer institut Dr Drago Stoian, Swiss Norwegian beamlines*</figDesc></figure>
