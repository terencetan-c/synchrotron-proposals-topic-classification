<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Structural changes of iron hydrides in the 100-200 GPa range </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background</head><p>Iron hydride is of prior interest for geophysical applications as hydrogen is a possible light element in the Earth's core. The question of its stability, stoichiometry and density under high pressure and temperature needs to be addressed . Iron hydride gives rise to a double-hcp structure, ε'-FeH x with x~1 under pressure. A previous study showed that it is stable up to at least ~80 GPa at ambient temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It has been predicted [2] that ε'-FeH undergoes a phase transition to an fcc structure above that pressure. Experimental studies in the Mbar range were thus needed to test this prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental technique</head><p>Iron samples have been loaded in the high pressure chamber of diamonds anvil cells with hydrogen as pressure medium; ε'-FeH x formed spontaneously above 3.5 GPa. The conditions reached in 5 experimental runs are summarized in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Diamond anvils with pits drilled by focused ion beam have been used in oder to ensure a better thermal insulation of the hydride samples during laser heating. X-Ray diffraction characterization was performed in situ with wavelength λ=0.3738Å. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Diffraction signal of '-FeHx with the dhcp structure was succesfully followed up to 105 GPa. The predicted phase transition to a fcc structure was not observed. The equation of state of '-FeH is reported in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The increase of bulk modulus above 40 GPa was not observed so that the change of stoichiometry proposed in Ref 1 can be ruled out.</p><p>By laser heating, we induced two phase transitions in the Fe-H system. Determination of the structures of these new phases is still ongoing. This very exciting observation needs to be reproduced in independent experimental runs; the electronic properties of these materials will be characterized with infrared spectroscopy which will complement the structural information provided by X-ray diffraction. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
