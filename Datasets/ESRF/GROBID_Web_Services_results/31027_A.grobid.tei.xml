<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this experiment was to search for the proposed antiferro-octupole order (AFO) in Phase IV of Ce 0.7 La 0.3 B 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, using Resonant X-ray Scattering (RXS). Although no direct evidence of magnetic octupole order has ever been reported, in theory, it maybe probed by RXS via E2 transitions. The RXS sensitivity arises from higher order terms in the E2 RXS described by rank-3 and rank-4 order tensors that couple to octupole and hexadecapole moments, respectively. The E1 RXS transitions contain only rank-1 and rank-2 order tensors which couple to dipole and quadrupole moments, respectively and so are insensitive to these higher order multipole degrees of freedom.</p><p>During our last experiment at XMaS, using the new 3 He displex with base temperature of 1K, we were successful in observing RXS at q=(½ ½ ½) positions below T IV =1.4K. Unfortunately, with polarisation analysis, the measured RXS intensity was very weak, with only 0.8cts on a background of 0.02cts. Nethertheless, we succeeded in obtaining high quality data by counting 10min/data-point. It is important to emphasise that, since this is a low temperature experiment (1 K), making measurements at a higher flux insertion device beamline would not improve the situation due to the beam-heating effects. Unfortunately, the inevitable low scattering rate has severely limited the amount of data we were able to collect in the allocated time of 18 shifts. Nevertheless, we have determined the temperature and azimuthal dependence of the intensity in both the σσ and σπ polarisations for both of the E1 and E2 RXS energy regimes. The temperature dependence is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The E2 σσ (blue circles) and σπ (red circles) disappear above T IV =1.5K as expected. In contrast, the E1 σπ intensity (red triangles) continues in temperature up to about 3K. Moreover, the q-width of this latter scattering is much broader the that of the E2 response suggesting short range order (as shown in the inset of fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These results suggest that the E1 and E2 RXS originate from physically different ordering phenomena.</p><p>The azimuth dependence of E1 and E2 scattering is compared in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The E1 intensity occurs only in σπ polarisation. This is consistent with antiferromagnetic dipole order of the 5d states. The broad q-width of the E1 which suggests short range ordered magnetic domains is consistent with the approximately flat E1 σπ azimuth dependence (see figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), however this may also arise from a moment aligned along &lt;111&gt;. The E2 azimuth dependence is dramatically different. The E2 σσ has six-fold symmetry and the σπ has 3-fold azimuthal symmetry. An analysis has been able to connect the 6-fold σ-σ azimuth with a rank-3 order tensor in the E2 RXS cross-section, giving direct confirmation of octupole order in phase IV of Ce 0.7 La 0.3 B 6 . However, and this is a crucial point, the phase of the concomitant 3-fold σscattering is 30 degrees away from the measured curve, i.e. with a point of inflection at Φ = 0. This enigma remains to be understood. We note that hexadecapole order yields 6-fold symmetry in both channels. Concerning the E1 and E2 temperature dependencies, the fits in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are to the order parameters I=|t| 2β with β(E2)=3*β(E1), which may be expected for E1 dipole magnetic and E2 octupole magnetic order. Thus a satisfactory understanding of the physical state in Ce 0.7 La 0.3 B 6 still eludes us. In the models considered, a key feature is that the σazimuth dependence is not symmetric about phi=0. Thus it is critical to obtain more data in our studies of this important prototype of strongly correlated electronic phases. T IV =1.5K as expected. However, the E1 σπ intensities continue up to 3K. Moreover, there is a considerable difference in q-width between E2 and E1 σπ intensities as shown in the inset. This suggests that the E1 RXS arises from short range order. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> exhibits that E1 and E2 are spatially and thermally different, i.e. of different physical origin.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> Right. The azimuth dependence. The E1 σπ azimuth is essentially featureless. This is consistent with short range ordered domains on 5d antiferromagnetic order and/or a moment along &lt;111&gt;. The E2 σπ has 3-fold azimuthal symmetry and the E2 σσ has 6-fold symmetry as indicated by the dashed eye-line guides. Whilst our analysis connects the 6-fold σ-σ azimuth with octupole order in phase IV of Ce 0.7 La 0.3 B 6 , the calculated phase of the concomitant 3-fold σscattering is 30 degrees away from the measured curve, i.e. with a point of inflection at Φ = 0. This enigma remains to be understood.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Left.
