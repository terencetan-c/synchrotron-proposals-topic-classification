<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During our 15 shift beamtime CH-6565 in July 2023, we carried out timeand spatially resolved operando high-energy X-ray diffraction experiments of desalination battery cathodes. These experiments were carried out in duplicate using realistic flow-by reactors for three distinct active materials across six varied aqueous salt solutions. Our overall aim was to unravel the ion intercalation mechanisms, as well as associated degradation processes and structural heterogeneity, and to correlate these to the desalination performance.</p><p>The experimental setup (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) was a three-electrode configuration featuring an AgCl quasi-reference electrode and an activated carbon cloth counter electrode parallel to the working electrode. The salt solution was pumped through the reactor between the electrodes ('flow-by' mode) at 15 mL/min. A stirred reservoir of the salt solution allowed for simultaneous conductivity and temperature measurements during desalination. Initially deintercalated LiMn2O4, Na0.44MnO2 and LiFePO4 served as working electrodes in 0.1 M chloride salt solutions of Li, Na, Li:Na 1:1, and Li:Mg 1:1 as well as synthetic seawater (SSW) and SSW with 0.014 M LiCl. The electrodes were cycled at a (dis-)charge rate of 4 hours and 10 hours (relative to the theoretical capacity) in constant-current mode with potential limits (GCPL) and using constant-current constant-voltage mode with time limits (CCCV). The reactors were placed into a high-throughput setup allowing the quasi-simultaneous measurement of three independent reactors at a time, each of which was measured at 36 points across the electrode surface with a resolution of 6 minutes over a course of 8 hours. In the following, we describe our preliminary findings, noting that in-depth data analysis is ongoing.</p><p>The figures below present the X-ray diffraction patterns, working electrode voltage and conductivity as a function of time. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the distinct phases that emerge during the intercalation and deintercalation processes: the formation of Li-rich LiFePO4 and the Li-poor FePO4. Both species exhibit the olivine phase with    different lattice parameters, leading to the distinct decrease and increase in peak intensities. When considering the NaCl solution, these processes face both thermodynamic and kinetic hinderance due to the larger ionic radius of Na. To overcome thermodynamic barriers, an extension of the potential window was used, while addressing kinetic constraints were addressed by operating at a lower C-rate. In Li:Na mixed solution (not explicitly shown here), a preferred formation of LiFePO4 was observed compared to the formation of NaFePO4. Furthermore, employing a three-step potentiostatic method revealed subsequent deintercalation of Na + and Li + . In SSW, the deintercalation and intercalation plateaus exhibit significant separation, accompanied by the evolution of several peaks. These observations are ascribed to the complexity of the SSW.</p><p>LiMn2O4 (LMO) cycled in LiCl (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) shows the anticipated shift in d-spacing, indicating contraction during deintercalation and expansion during intercalation. In SSW with additional Li presented good cycling behaviour. A preliminary analysis of the data suggests a strong selectivity towards Li, with an additional intercalation of magnesium at low potentials (&lt;0V vs. AgCl). Na0.44MnO2 (NMO) in SSW demonstrated good cycling behaviour (similar to pure NaCl electrolyte, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and displays enhanced salt removal with successive cycles. This suggests an activation process of the electrode material specific to the SSW environment, which was not observed in NaCl electrolyte. CCCV testing of this electrode/electrolyte setup exhibited no further intercalation occurring during the constant-voltage step. The upcoming stages of analysis encompass removal of background, phase identification, calculation of unit cell parameters, calculation of intercalated ion mass and the creation of quantitative phase maps of the electrodes. We anticipate that our analysis will shed light on intercalation mechanisms, degradation processes, and structural heterogeneity resulting from ion distribution along and adjacent to the flow path.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): HUCK, Marten (Department of Chemistry, Paderborn University, Germany) * KUHLMANN, Andreas (Department of Chemistry, Paderborn University, Germany) * SKRENTNY, Emil-Jan (Department of Chemistry, Paderborn University, Germany) * STEINRUECK, Hans-Georg (Department of Chemistry, Paderborn University, Germany) *</figDesc></figure>
