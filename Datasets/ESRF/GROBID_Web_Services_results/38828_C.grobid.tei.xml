<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The influence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) while shearing at 136 0 C on oriented structure formation is investigated by using high resolution time resolved wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) for high density polyethylene having broad molecular weight distribution (MWD). In the previous beamtime (26-02-398: 03 December 2007 to: 07 December 2007), our results indicated that it could be possible to generate initial structures at high temperature (142 0 C) just above equilibrium melting point (T m = 141.2 0 C) for linear polyethylene using time resolved small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). However, the result also suggested decrease in the intensity of the equatorial streak with the increasing amount of zirconia -i.e. the presence of zirconia nanoparticles inhibits chain orientation prior to crystallization. The purspose of this study is to compare the results obtained using multi-walled nanotubes with that of obtained using zirconia nanoparticles to study the influence of nanoparticles on chain orientation of broad molar mass distribution polymer. The pulse of shear (100/s for 1s) is applied to HDPE of broad molar mass distribution having two different concentrations (0.25% and 0.5%) multiwalled nanotubes at 136 0 C, followed by cooling to crystallization temperature (T Cryst =125 0 C), where the sheared sample was kept at isothermal condition for 600s to monitor the structure development, subsequently followed by cooling to room temperature. It is noticeable that the highly oriented arc-like patterns are obtained at T cryst = 125  Figure 3: The figure shows the time resolved 3D plots of intensity (a.u) vs. 2θ (degrees) for full profiles after sample were sheared (100/s for 1s) at 136 0 C. It is expected that the onset of crystallization shifts to higher side of temperature with the increasing concentration of nanotubes. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure1: The figure shows the schematic drawing of the thermal history applied to study the structure development under shear. T 1 corresponds to the high temperature above melting point at which sample was kept for 2 minutes to remove the melt history, T 2 corresponds to the temperature at which shear was applied while T 3 corresponds to the room temperature.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The figure shows the 2D-WAXS patterns for the given HDPE of broad molar mass distribution with two different concentrations (0.25% and 0.5%) of multiwalled nanotubes at two different temperatures (125 0 C and 60 0 C). The shear was applied at 136 0 C, while the sheared samples were kept at isothermal condition at T Cryst =125 0 C for 600s to follow the formation of oriented structures. Note that highly oriented arc-like patterns obtained at T cryst = 125 0 C changes position with increasing concentration of nanotubes. Moreover, the 200 reflections in samples containing 0.5% MWNT shows shift as compared to that of neat and 0.25% MWNT (Please refer figure 4)</figDesc><graphic coords="4,51.12,36.84,492.30,331.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4: The figure shows azimuthal distribution of intensities at 60 0 C after the application of shear at 136 0 C. Note that 110 reflection becomes sharp with the increase in nanotube concentration while 200 reflection changes its position with respect to azimuthal angle (please see (c) in the figure) for 0.5% MWNT concentration. The azimuthal offset between the maxima of 110 and 200 reflection suggest the overgrowth of twisted kebabs.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,38.64,36.84,527.04,434.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
