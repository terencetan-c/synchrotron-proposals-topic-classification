<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of the experiment aimed to discover the internal structure of the jumping apparatus of recent and fossil beetles (JA) by the use of 3D microtomography. We have focused on identification both sclerotized internal structures and muscles are involved in the jumping mechanism. In total, full 3D scans of 16 species of recent beetles from the families Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae, Scirtidae, Buprestidae and Anthribidae and three samples of fossil beetles (family Chrysomelidae) in amber have been performed.</p><p>The freshly caught specimens of beetles were preserved in 70% alcohol; the hind legs removed and stepwise dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations, and critical-point; dry specimens from museum collections and amber samples were left intact. The hind legs and ambers were glued onto the tips of plastic stubs. We used the ID19 beamline at 19 keV (wavelength of 8•10 -11 m) and an effective detector pixel size of 0.65 μm with a corresponding field of view of 1.43 mm by 1.43 mm; 6000 projections were recorded over the 180 deg rotation. The detector-to-sample distance was 12 mm. For the selected species the 3D reconstruction of the hind jumping legs and JA correspondingly we used the graphic segmentation tool software Amira® 6.0 (FEI Company, Visage Imaging, Germany).</p><p>Based on the obtained 3D reconstructions and following laboratory observations functional models of jumping apparatus and the mechanism of jumping for the beetles families Chrysomelidae (subfamily Galerucinae), Curculionidae (subfamily Curculioninae) and Scirtidae have been proposed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Chrysomelidae, leaf beetles (exemplified by Sphaeroderma testacea).</head><p>The jumping apparatus of leaf beetles according to the 3D microtomography-based reconstructions <ref type="bibr">(Nadein &amp; Betz, 2016)</ref> is localized in the hind legs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and formed by femur, tibia, femoro-tibial joint, modified metafemoral extensor tendon (MET), extensor ligament, tibial flexor sclerite (TFS), extensor and flexor muscles. The primary role of the metafemoral extensor tendon is seen in the formation of an increased attachment site for the extensor muscles. The rubber-like protein resilin was detected in the extensor ligament, i.e. a short, elastic element connecting the extensor tendon with the tibial base. The calculated specific joint power (max. 0.714 W g -1 ) of the femoro-tibial joint during the jumping movement and the fast full extension of the hind tibia (1-3 ms) suggest that jumping is performed via a catapult mechanism releasing energy that has beforehand been stored in the extensor ligament during its stretching by the extensor muscles.</p><p>In addition, the morphology of the femoro-tibial joint suggests that the co-contraction of the flexor and the extensor muscles in the femur of jumping leg is involved in this process. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Curculionidae, weevils (exemplified by Orchestes fagi).</head><p>Principal structural elements of the jumping apparatus in weevils (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) revealed by the 3D microtomography are (Nadein &amp; Betz, submitted): (1) the femoro-tibial joint, (2) the metafemoral extensor tendon (MET), (3) the extensor ligament (e.l.), ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) the flexor ligament (f.l.), ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) the tibial flexor sclerite (TFS), and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) the extensor and flexor muscles. The kinematic parameters, the specific joint power and the time for the full extension of the hind tibia suggest that the jump is performed via a catapult mechanism with attribution of the additional kinetic energy. A resilin-bearing elastic extensor ligament that connects the extensor tendon and the tibial base is considered the structure for the accumulation of the elastic strain energy for the jump. According to our functional model, the extensor ligament is loaded by the contraction of the extensor muscles, while the co-contraction of the antagonistic extensor and flexor muscles prevent the early extension of the tibia. This is due to the leverage factors of the femoro-tibial joint that provide a mechanical advantage of the flexor muscles over the extensor muscles in the fully flexed position. Abbreviations: e.l., extensor ligament; f.l., flexor ligament; MET, metafemoral extensor tendon; TFS, tibial flexor sclerite.</p><p>Jumping apparatus of fossil beetles in amber.</p><p>Due to the peculiar conditions of the fixation, preservation and further fossilization the internal anatomical elements of arthropods in ambers are usually poorly presented. Two specimens of Late Eocene amber (Danish and Rovno ambers, both of the age 37.2-33.9 Ma) with leaf beetle inclusions (family Chrysomelidae) mophologically belonging to the group of jumping leaf beetles Galerucinae have been scanned. Reconstruction of the 3D microtomography data revealed the sclerotized structure inside the swollen hind femur identified as modified extensor tendon (MET) that is characteristic to the most of jumping beetles.</p><p>MET could be considered as a reliable marker of the presence of jumping apparatus and jumping ability correspondingly. Morphology of the reconstructed MET of the fossil leaf beetles is characterised by the complex structure corresponding to that of the recent relatives of the fossil species.  Publications 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><figDesc>3D microtomography data for the three specimens of ambers with inclusions of fossil leaf beetles have been obtained in our experiments at the ESRF. The chosen specimens of amber are characterised by the poor visibility of the inclusions, low transparency and the presence of the internal objects making examination hard. The obtained microtomography data of these amber specimens allowed us to reconstruct the 3D virtual volume depictions of the beetle inclusions with the high detalisation. Based on these data two new genera and three new species have been described (Nadein et al. 2016): Psyllototus viking Nadein, 2016; Archealtica convexa Nadein, 2016; Paleomolpus hirtus Nadein, 2016.</figDesc></figure>
