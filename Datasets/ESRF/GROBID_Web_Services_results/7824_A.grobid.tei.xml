<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim was to test a novel method for three dimensional characterization of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. The method is based on the use of high energy synchrotron radiation in transmission mode. A combination of a collimated incoming beam and a conical slit is used to define a small gauge volume in the bulk of a specimen. A Copper specimen (3x3~1 mm 3 ), where the surface previously had been characterized by electron microscopy (EBSP), should be investigated in 3D. In addition the aim was to study kinetics of selected grain boundaries in Nickel. Set-Up: A mosaic (20") SrTiO3 monochromator providing 50 times more intensity than the standard Si monochromators was installed. The energy was tuned to 87.81 keV, in order to match the (111) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) reflections of Copper with the opening angles of the conical slit system /l/. The incoming beam was defined to 20 pm x 20 pm by two cross slit systems. The sample was mounted on x,y,@stage behind the slit systems. The gap of the conical slit was 5Opm, leading to a 20x20~500 pm3 trapezoidal gauge volume. Behind the conical slit the diffraction patterns were registered with a tapered CCD-camera. The collimated beam was aligned with the copper surface to within 0.01". As reference positions, the edges of the sample were determined with a precision of 1Opm. We report here only on near-surface measurements where direct comparisons to the EBSP technique can be done.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Results: The determined grain orientations and grain morphology are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> 121. At the synchrotron a grid with a step-size of 2Opm was performed for each grain. Boundaries were determined by the intensity half-point. To increase accuracy several boundaries were mapped with more than one reflection. The deviation in grain orientations between the two techniques is of order OS", which is the uncertainty of the EBSP technique. The maximum deviation in grain boundary positions were 25pm. Grain boundary positions based on reflections from each of the two neighboring grains -cf. grain P in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>-corresponded within 20pm. Due to the time consuming experimental set-up, measurements on Nickel were not attempted. Outlook: The necessary instrumental developments needed to fully exploit this technique were discussed at the ESRF workshop on 'Local characterization of materials'. Conical slits allowing the definition of local volumes of order 5x5~50 pm3 are in development. Ill H.F.Poulsen, S.Garbe, T.Lorentzen, D. Juul Jensen, F.W. Poulsen, N.H.
