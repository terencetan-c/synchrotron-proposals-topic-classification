<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We proposed to establish a new absolute pressure scale in the megabar region based on the measurement of the thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) from high quality MgO single crystal. We have performed the experiments on single MgO crystals but we ran into considerable problems which are detailed below.</p><p>The TDS from single single crystals is extremely sensitive to the elastic strain experienced by the sample in the high pressure cell. We have found after 4 days of trial that the quality of the sample diffuse scattering is severely altered above a few GPa. While the peaks intensities might be sufficient to performe structure analysis from bragg peaks, we have concluded that TDS under high pressure is practically very difficult to perform. The TDS was systematically parasited by elastic scattering from high pressure induced defects on the crystals, and the crystal quality was not good enough for TDS analysis above a few GPa.</p><p>After a four days of unsuccesfull trials, it was decided to stop the experiment.</p></div>			</div>
