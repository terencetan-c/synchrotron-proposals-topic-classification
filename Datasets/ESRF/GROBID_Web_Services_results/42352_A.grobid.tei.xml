<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the imaging campaign in 2009 at ESRF, France in total ~40 shale/mudstone samples were imaged. The samples were from a number of geological settings in Europe, South Africa and the US. The main purpose was to analyze the primary fracture pattern in samples under study. However, a few imaged samples were from some presumably mature shale formations under HPHT conditions and several of the samples were exposed to gradual rising temperature under atmospheric pressure during the imaging process. This report will start with a brief summary of this process and continues with a review of the samples imaged and the proposed way forward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CT on the rock samples</head><p>A number of shale samples were imaged in two different synchrotron facilities. The samples were from:</p><p>• Karoo basin, South Africa which are denoted by "DP" and "KL" throughout this report and in the appended tables • Kimmeridge Shale, Dorset, UK represented by "DO" • Green River Basin Shales, Utah represented by "GRS" Most of the samples were from immature shale deposits; however there were some coming from the Karoo basin, which were cooked already being exposed to magmatic intrusions while are called KL samples, KL being the name of the wellbore. Besides, some of the immature samples were gradually heated under atmospheric pressure to investigate the evolution of the cracks and fracture patterns.</p><p>The imaging process was as follows: The samples were rotating either 180 degrees or 360 degrees and they were imaged 1500 and 2500 times respectively. Afterwards a volume reconstruction algorithm was used to reconstruct 3D volumes and generate the horizontal cross-sectional images of various samples. To reduce the size of the images 32 bit images were converted into 8-bit images in the end. 17 samples from Green River Shales (GRS) were in total imaged. GRS formations are immature. One of these samples were cooked at 250 deg. C for 7 days and imaged and one was cooked at 350 deg. C for 12 hours and imaged. Another one was cooked for 12 hours and was scanned 68 times during heating. A cross section is depicted in the figure below showing before and after the heating process.</p></div>

One of the DP samples was exposed to rising temperatures and 12 scans were obtained during this process. The figures below show examples of KL and DP samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"KL1_6930_10005" SAMPLE</head><p>In total, 29 Kimmeridge shale samples were imaged. Two of these samples were imaged after heating at 350 deg. C for 12 hours. One sample was cooked at 250 deg. C for 7 days and imaged. The rest of the samples were combination of mature and immature samples. Samples of these samples are shown in the figures below.</p><p>The quality of the scanned samples was very good and we did the 3D reconstruction in the week following the experiment, using ESRF and ID19 facilities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The analyses and publications</head><p>The softwares AvizoFire and ImageJ were utilized to generate the 3D volumes and analyze the fracture patterns and calculate various porosities of the 3D volumes. Especially interesting are those few samples which were imaged before and after the heating process. These analyses pave the way for international publications of this study.</p><p>Two publications have been submitted on this study: one in the best journal of geophysics (Journal of Geophysical Research) is accepted pending moderate revisions, one in the Society for Petroleum Engineering is under review. In both articles, the first two authors are Ph.D. students who participated to the ESRF experiment and/or to the analysis of the 3D data. For both of them, the ESRF experiment is part of their Ph.D. project.</p><p>The results of the experiments have been presented also in two international conferences. The references of all publications are given below.</p></div>
