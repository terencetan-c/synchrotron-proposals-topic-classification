<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of this experiment was to assess the effects of the therapeutic protocol based on stereotactic synchrotron radiotherapy enhanced by photon-activation of platinum on the development of ethyl-nitrosourea in utero induced rat brain tumors. The tumoral model used presents some particular difficulties for the treatment and the follow-up. This is due to the fact that the position, type and grade of the tumors is quite disparate from one animal to another. Nevertheless, it is known that about 80% of the tumors developed are oligodendrogliomas-like, and the rest mostly glioblastoma-like. Extracranial tumors may also be found in some animals. These challenges make it an interesting case, closer to the clinical problem than other models.</p><p>A therapeutical protocol was designed for this model. It consists of an intracranial injection of cis-Pt in a large section of the brain and a hemispherical irradiation with monochromatic x-rays at an energy just above the Kedge absorption of the platinum (78.39 keV). A total of 46 animals were initially imaged in the MRI unit 2.35 T at the Inserm U836-5 facilities at CHU-Grenoble. The groups of animals for the ESRF protocol were prepared from the information of these MRI explorations. Four groups of N=8 animals were selected (total of 32 animals). They were chosen to have as homogeneous as possible pathologies within the groups. The first group was to be jus injected with cis-Pt, the second group to be just irradiated, the third to be both injected and irradiated and the fourth was to be kept as a control. Some of the animals were imaged by synchrotron computed tomography, after injection of iodinated contrast agent.</p><p>The intracranial injections were preformed with the aid of a stereotactic frame. The drug was delivered with a Hamilton syringe and 33-gauge needle. The injection was guided with an automatic pump, set to diffuse the drug in convection enhanced delivery conditions. The injections were performed in the labs of the BMF facility. The animals were then irradiated approximately 24h after the injections.</p><p>The irradiations were done in the optics hutch of ID17 in stereotactic synchrotron radiation therapy (SSRT) mode. The beam was tuned to an energy of 80 keV and collimated to have uniform intensity across its section. The slits were set to 1 mm thick, both for imaging and irradiation. Before irradiation, the head of the animals was imaged in tomographic mode, in order to get a reference for positioning the tumor in the center of rotation. The irradiation time was set to deliver a dose in the tumor of 15 Gy. The development of the tumors was followed-up at the CHU-Grenoble by MRI, before and after the experiment at the ESRF.</p><p>The volume of the tumor was measured from the MRI images to follow-up the temporal evolution of their size. In many cases, clear tumor regression was observed both in combined therapy (radio-and chemotherapy) and in just radiotherapy. In some cases, a total disappearance of the tumor was observed. The analysis of the data shows an apparent diversity of results, due to the heterogeneity of the model itself, but some trends are clearly seen. As a general rule, the irradiated tumors tend to diminish its size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and some disappear completely <ref type="bibr">(Fig 2)</ref>. The data analysis is under way and further study and interpretation of the results is needed.</p><p>Apparently, at this stage of the data analysis, there is no a clear difference between the effect on the tumors by simple irradiation or by combined chemo-radiotherapy. On the other hand, in the group just treated with chemotherapy there was no significant different with the control, untreated animals, and the tumors continued to grow. However, the good results in tumor regression are encouraging and further studies are required. For example, the tumors could be targeted directly with the CDDP instead of the whole hemisphere. This should help to differentiate the tumor types and its response to treatment and to assure an homogeneous diffusion of the drug inside some very heterogeneous tumors.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
