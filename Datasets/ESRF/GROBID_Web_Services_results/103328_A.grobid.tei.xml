<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment number:</head><p>HC-5239</p><p>Beamline:</p><p>ID32</p><p>Date of experiment: from: 04 April 2023 to: 11 April 2023 Date of report: 7/31/2023 Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): Flora Yakhou Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof Eduardo Higino da Silva Neto | Yale University, Dept of Physics Prof. Fabio Boschini | INRS Centre Energie Materiaux Télécommunications Dr. Alex Frano | UCSD, Dept. of Physics Kirsty Scott* | Yale University, Dept of Physics Xinze Yang*| Yale University, Dept of Physics Rourav Basak* | UCSD, Dept. of Physics Report:</p><p>The goal of the experiment was to determine the nature of the high energy quasi-circular dynamic correlations observed by Cu-L3 RIXS.</p><p>Recently, our group and collaborators found charge order (CO) correlations in Bi-2212 (via Cu-L3 RIXS measurements at ALS) that, while strongest in the static CO direction (i.e., the Cu-O bond direction), persist in all directions of the Cu-O plane with a finite q = qCO, forming a quasicircular manifold of dynamic electron correlations, see Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref> [1]. The quasicircular dynamic correlations (QCDCs) were detected with low energy resolution (~800meV) in the sub-1eV region. We expanded upon this finding with highresolution (38meV) RIXS measurements (at NSLS-II and Diamond) and confirmed the presence of the QCDCs at low energies by using the softening of the bond-stretching phonon as a marker for charge correlations, see Fig. 70 60 50 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 ϕ: Phonon Energy (meV) 0°2 5°3 0°3 5°4 5°C |q| (r.l.u.)</p><p>QCDCs via phonon softening, we were unable to extract the precise energy profile of the QCDCs. While the momentum space quasi-circular pattern is observed in the energy integrated data from 100 to 700meV, the QCDCs are likely broad over energy and weaker than the overlapping paramagnon contributions, precluding the extraction of their spectral shape in a traditional RIXS measurement.</p><p>Following the methodology successfully employed in our previous high-resolution (41meV) polarimetric RIXS measurement (HC-4824), Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>, which indicated the usefulness of polarimetric RIXS to decouple the (cross polarized) spin-flip features from (non-cross polarized) charge correlations, we proposed to do polarimetric RIXS to try to disentangle QCDC contributions from paramagnon excitations. The plan was to employ polarimetric RIXS for three different azimuthal angles, φ, and a range of q-values around qCO to verify the charge-like nature of QCDCs.</p><p>To increase flux, we relaxed the energy resolution to ~100meV and to maximize the coupling to charge order excitation we chose incoming σ-geometry. We performed rocking scans at φ=0° and φ=30° from the Cu-O direction (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). The blue (red) data represents the integrated intensity from 200meV to 600meV of the non-cross (cross) channel. However, our ability to detect a peak is compromised by (i) signal-to-noise limitations due to the lower flux in a polarimetric RIXS measurement, and (ii) the large background slopes observed in data in Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>.</p><p>At that point, we modified our experimental plan, opting to repeat the φ=0° measurement with incoming πgeometry (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). This data indicates a peak in intensity of the π-π' (non-cross) channel in the vicinity of q= qCO (marked by the dashed line), as expected in the high-energy QCDC scenario. However, we would like to confirm this finding by performing a second measurement, with more q points and longer counting times. Additionally, as this measurement was taken along the static CO direction, we still require measurements at different φ-values to achieve the primary goal of the proposal. Still, this first beamtime allowed us to optimize several experimental parameters and led us to realize that incoming π-geometry may be preferrable for these measurements.</p><p>Using the information gained from this experiment, we intend to expand upon these measurements and apply to additional beamtime at ID32 to image high-energy QCDCs by completing polarimetric measurements at φ=30° and 45°, with incoming π-geometry.</p><p>[1] F. <ref type="bibr">Boschini et al.
