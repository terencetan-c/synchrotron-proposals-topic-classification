<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A mixture of Mg(NH 2 ) 2 with LiH in a molar ratio of 3:8 can be release about 7wt% of hydrogen. The details of the dehydrogenation reaction have not been investigated yet. The sample was heated in vacuum with a heating rate of 1 o C/min up to 500 o C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). With increasing temperature, intensities for Mg(NH 2 ) 2 and LiH decreased and the pattern of a new phase appeared. This transformation was accelerated from around 150 o C and completed at around 200 o C. This new pattern started to split above 200 o C. Unfortunately the boron glass capillary was broken during the reaction, probably because of a small emission of NH 3 . The sample was quickly oxidized above around 300 o C. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) LiND 2 +2LiD</head><p>A mixture of LiND 2 and LiD in a molar ratio of 1:2 can be release about 6wt% of hydrogen. Some reaction mechanisms have been proposed, but they are still not clear. The sample was heated in vacuum with a heating rate of 1 o C/min up to 315 o C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The pattern of Li 2 O appeared and rapidly grew up above 150 o C. It is because the boron glass capillary was broken in the same way as the reaction of Mg(NH 2 ) 2 with LiH described above. (c) Sr-Al-D The sample was synthesized from SrCl 2 and LiAlD 4 by ball milling and annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere aiming for a new Sr-Al-D compound. The reaction expected is: SrCl 2(s) + 2LiAlD 4(s) → Sr(AlD 4 ) 2(s) + LiCl (s) The sample was heated in vacuum with a heating rate of 2 o C/min up to 400 o C (see Fig. 3). At the starting temperature, a pattern corresponding to a new Sr-Al-D phase with relatively broad peaks is seen, in addition to LiCl (blue arrows) and Al (red arrows). This phase began to transform to another phase at around 200 o C and remained up to 340 o C. Above this temperature, a further decomposition proceeded. Structure analysis of the observed phase has not yet been done.  LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 was measured under dynamic vacuum from 70 ºC to 220 ºC at a constant heating rate of 0.5 ºC/minute. Several phases are observed during the temperature increase. The reaction occurring is: LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3(s) → LiMgAlD 6(s) + 2Al (s) + 3D 2(g) → LiD (s) + MgD 2(s) + 3Al (s) + 3/2D 2(s) . LiCl, a biproduct in the synthesis, is present at all temperatures. The data are difficult to interpret because LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 and LiMgAlD 6 diffract weakly; probably due to a high degree of amorphous character. In addition, a LiMgAlD 6 sample prepared by thermal decompostion of LiMg(AlD 4 ) 2 prior to the experiments, was measured ex-situ. Structure determination of LiMgAlD 6 is in progress.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> The figure shows the diffraction pattern at three different temperatures for the LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 system. Index_001 was collected at 68 ºC; Index_073 was collected at 151 ºC; Index_170 was collected at 217 ºC.</p><p>(e) Zr 2 PdD x Zr 2 Pd (tetraonal, space group, I4/mmm, MoSi 2 -type structure) absorbs deuterium to the composition Zr 2 PdD 5 . The crystal structure of Zr 2 PdD 2 is known to be an expanded version of the intermetallic structure, however the structure at both higher and lower deuterium content is unclear. A sample with composition Zr 2 PdD 3 was measured in-situ from ambient temperature to 600 ºC under dynamical vacuum. Peak splitting was observed for deuterium contents Zr 2 PdD &gt;2 indicating symmetry lower than that for the intermetallic. An expanded tetragonal MoSi 2 -type structure was observed for Zr 2 PdD &lt;2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), thus disproving earlier indications of an orthorhombic phase in that composition range. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General remarks</head><p>There were few, if any, problems with the instrument and the supporting equipment during the experiments. The hot air blower worked beautifully and gave very stable heating rates from room temperature up to 850 ºC. All the software was stable, and the beam was only lost for one short period.</p><p>We did learn that boron glass capillaries are corroded quickly my ammonia at elevated temperatures. Thus, other kind of capillaries will be used in future in-situ experiments involving amides and imides.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Sr-Al-D (d) LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 and LiMgAlD 6 (e) Zr 2 PdD x (a) 3Mg(NH 2 ) 2 +8LiH</figDesc></figure>
