<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Soluble and insoluble impurities mapping in the ice by X-ray Fluorescence.</p><p>CONTEXT OF THE STUDY Interpretation of the climatic records trapped in polar ice requires the understanding of the interaction between the ice and the different impurities (soluble or insoluble). In this context, the knowledge of the localization of these impurities is of primary importance. In this project, we used the microfluorescence (µ X.R.F.) probe developed at the ID21 beam line to map the impurities distribution in the ice. In order to avoid sublimation and transformation of the ice sample we used a cryo cooled cell developed during the ME 481 experiment (1)(2). Soluble and insoluble impurities mapping in the ice by X-Ray Fluorescence have been realized and have begun to provide answers to a better understanding of impurities and ice interaction. The goal of this new experiment CH1568 was to improve the experimental procedure, validate previous results and study accreted ice from Antarctica. In this report we briefly describe the main results of this experiment; the results are detailed in two articles which are close to be submitted (3)(4).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A) Blank of the experimental procedure and background estimation</head><p>To estimate the contamination introduced by the sample preparation, two kinds of tests have been performed :</p><p>1) Influence of the Ultralene film. As already mentioned in the previous experiments a large chloride signal was observed and we suspected that the glue used to fix the Ultralene film on the cell window or the Ultralene itself were at the origin of this signal. To test that and the influence of the film we have performed a spectrum of an empty sample cell. The results are presented in table two. Although a significant Chloride peak is present, the signal is about 10 times lower than in the ME481 experiment. This confirm that the main contamination arised from the glue.</p><p>2) Synthetic ice sample (S1) has been prepared from extra-pure water. They have been analysed by ion chromatography (see table <ref type="table">1</ref>) and XRF techniques (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>) under the same experimental conditions as for real polar ice samples. These two tests give very similar results in particular for the Chloride peak. Since Ion chromatography for the S1 synthetic sample has not detected Cl, the Ultralene® film, very close to the sample surface is most likely the origin of the Cl peak.</p><p>When comparing the Ultralene to the synthetic ice, the Ultralene peak of all the other elements are slightly higher than the synthetic sample. This can be due to the influence of the aluminium cell which is empty and the cell signal is not absorbed by the sample. Thus we will consider the intensity of the« clean » synthetic sample as the background signal of the experiment. To consider an element as significantly present in polar ice, the µX.R.F. signal should be at least two times higher than the synthetic sample signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B ) Sample conservation during the experiment</head><p>The major risk of transformation of samples is sublimation. Sublimation can be due to a leak of the sample cell which is in a vacuum chamber. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  The spectrum is dominated by a high peak from Ar. This result is due to the presence of air in the sample cell and hence its air tightness.</p><p>To check the stability of the sample and the reproducibility of the method, a particle has been examined three times with an interval of 2h 30mn. The Si intensity and shape are shown on figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> and <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. The shape of the inclusion does not change and the intensity slightly decrease. This could suggest a slight evolution of the sample, but we can note that this decrease remains in the reproducibility range of the method. 0 12 24 36 48 m 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 t 2h30 5h00 7h30 Figure 2b : Shape evolution of the Si µm Intensity 5</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Natural samples of ice accreted from the lake Vostok which lies under the Antarctic ice sheet at about 3750 m below the surface have been analyzed. This ice is characterized by very large crystals and can includes big aggregates (figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5)</ref>.</p><p>We present here results from two samples V1 and V2 taken at 3551m and 3572m depth respectively. V1 is in particular characterized by a large visible aggregate (aggregate 1).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>: aggregate 1 of the sample taken at 3551 m depth (V1)</p><p>This kind of inclusion, not seen in normal glacier ice is formed from the concentration from very fine particle locally accumulated during the accretion of the ice. The gas around the aggregate was initially at about 300 bar, thus the inclusion is highly unstable and µX.R.F. measurement appears to be an unique way to get the in situ repartition of the elements. At the end of the experiment (after about 20 hours, this aggregate disappeared ).</p></div>

Although taken at the same depth than the large aggregate, V1 did not contained visible inclusion. The two samples contained large amount of Chloride and Sodium.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ionic species</head><p>The results from the ice matrix of the two samples are very similar and they are not significantly different than the synthetic results. As the ion chromatography of the synthetic ice has shown very low level of the species of interest, this suggest that these matrix are very clean and that all the impurities are strongly localized. It is interesting to note that the two aggregates have very different composition. The sulfur is mainly contained in aggregate 1, while the Chloride is mainly in the aggregate 2. Furthermore, the results suggest that the aggregate 1 is formed of small mineral particles while NaCl is the main component of the aggregate 2.  0 3,9 7,8 11,7 15,6 19,5 23,4 27,3 31,2 35,1 39 42,9 0 0,05 0,1 0,15 0,2 0,25 0,3 0,35 0,4 0,45 S(+VI) et S(-II) µm S(-II) S(+VI) Intensity Figure 4c : S(+VI) and S(-II) (16,8µm) along the cross section of the particle By supplying cartographies of elements for their different oxidation numbers the new technique adds useful information on the likely origins of impurities. CONCLUSION During this experiment, we have improved and normalised the experimental procedure developed in the ME481 project. In particular, we have removed the major source of Cl contamination and determined the background of the experiment by systematic analysis of synthetic samples. Being non invasive, this µXRF technique allows to scrutinize unstable impurities and replicate experiments in order to confirm and refine results. Beyond the detection of elements within impurities the technique enables their speciation which may help finding the origins of impurities. As compared to SEM technique integration times are much shorter which enables large chemical mapping. Combined with ion chromatography , µXRF analysis of synthetic samples comes out with an enhanced reliability of results and more quantitative interpretations. Results obtained from Vostok accreted ice show benefits gained from the new technique. For the first time, it has been possible to see the high chemical heterogeneity of this ice and to make visible the association of the different elements.</p></div>
