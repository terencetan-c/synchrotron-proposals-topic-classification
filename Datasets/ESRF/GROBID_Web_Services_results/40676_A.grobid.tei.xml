<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The fabrication of Ge-NC's by decomposition of GeO x (0&lt;x&lt;2) out of a (GeO x -SiO 2 ) superlattice structure (SL) has been studied in-situ sputtering chamber at ROBL. The SL of (GeO x / SiO 2 ) 19x were grown by dual reactive DC magnetron sputtering from elemental targets. Different Ge/O ratios in the SL structures were realized by the variation of deposition temperature.  The X-ray reflectivity (XRR) curves, of the deposition at room temperature and at 200 o C respectively, show clearly highly orderered SL structures. For the RT deposition one can observe a split of the superlattice peaks at the 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th order. This indicates a slight variation off less then &gt; 0.5nm for the period thickness of the multilayer. For samples with a deposition temperature of 200 o C only a little split at the 4 th order can be seen. Therefore the variarity in thickness can be taken as negligible small. The simulation of the XRR curves reveal smoother interfaces for the SL deposited at 200°C compared to RT deposition (roughness σ = 1.0 / 0.6 nm for T D = RT / 200°C, resp.)</p><p>The diffrence of the two samples becomes more significant when the samples are post-annealed. Samples deposited at RT clearly show a degrading of the SL structure with every annealing step [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>], indicated by less and less observed SL peaks. Samples grown at T = 200 o C do not show this degradation [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>]. Furthermore a little improvement of the SL structure can be observed during the annealing step to 540 o C which is kept also at 600 o C.</p><p>The crystalisation process of the Ge particles was monitored with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction as a function of annealing temperature. For both depostion temperatures the postannealing of the SL structures is leading to the growth of Ge NC's at about 540-550 o C [Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref> This corresponds with a huge increase of the Ge NC's size after this annealing step. The crystals are equal sized or even bigger in size then the SL period (9.64 nm).  Ge (111), Fit 2 (Lorenzian) T A (°C) 2θ (deg) FWHM NC Size 545 o C 19.032 1.427 4.54 nm 570 o C 18.975 1.501 4.32 nm 630 o C 19.031 1.110 5.85 nm 690 o C 19.038 0.898 7.22 nm 810 o C From these results one can clearly conclude that the stochiometry of the GeOx layer is influenced strongly by the depostion temperature. 19.021 0.655 9.90 nm Tab. 1: Fit results of Ge (111) reflection References: [1] M.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><figDesc>]. Hereby one can derive the temperature 540 o C as the necessary crystal formation temperature. This result corresponds with the results of M. Zacharias et al. [1] for the formation of Ge NC's out of a SiGeOx alloy films. Samples deposited at RT show no Ge (111) signal at T = 510 o C. A weak signal can be obtained at T = 545 o C. The FWHM gives, fitted and calculated with Scherrer's equation, a NC's size of 4 nm. Within further annealing up to 630 o C the average cystal size increases and is finally around 7.2 nm at T = 690 o C [Tab. 1]. The interface roughness of the SL structure increases significantly after this annealing step. Annealing at 810 o C finally destroys the superlattice structure.</figDesc></figure>

Here the crystal size can be determind to be 2.3 nm. It shows that Ge NC's have almost reached the maximum possible size which corresponds to the GeO x layer size of about 2.4 nm.</figDesc></figure>
