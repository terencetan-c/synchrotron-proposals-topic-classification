<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experiment HE-3861 was dedicated to the investigation of the magnetic properties and the magnetic coupling between neighboring metal atoms self-assembled into two-dimensional metal-organic networks on a Au(111) single-crystal surface by supramolecular self-organization with molecules containing pyridine or cyano organic endgroups. We had found a sizeable magnetic coupling between Fe atoms self-assembled into a network with 2,4,6-tris(4pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (T4PT) in a previous experiment (see report on HE-3537 or Ref.</p><p>[1]).</p><p>The aim of the present experiment was to study the effect on this coupling between the metal centers when replacing the T4PT linkers by similar molecules, namely 1,3,5-tri(4-pyridyl)benzene (T4PB) or 4,4',4"-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tribenzonitrile (T4CPT) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), and/or Fe by Co. As confirmed before the beamtime by low-temperature STM, both, Fe and Co, form identical-looking networks when the same organic linkers are used.</p><p>The preparation was carried out in-situ at the ESRF taking advantage of the dedicated STM chamber connected to the high-field magnet of the ID08 beamline. Before studying the samples by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the formation of the metal-organic networks was confirmed and characterized by STM. As an example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref> shows a typical STM image taken during the beamtime. The sample of T4PB and Fe on Au(111) consists of islands with ordered arrays of 2-dimensional metal-organic network, with an average island size of around 10 nm. Temperature and magnetic field-dependent XAS and XMCD spectra were recorded at the Fe L 2,3 edges and the N K edge in total electron yield mode using circularly and linearly ppolarized light at normal (90°) and grazing (20°) incidence angles. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the XAS and XMCD of an Fe-T4CPT sample at the Fe L 2,3 edges for grazing and normal incidence measured at 8 K in a magnetic field of 5 T parallel to the X rays. The spectra are very similar to those previously obtained from Fe-T4PT networks. The analysis of the field dependence of the Fe L 3 XMCD signal reveals that a magnetic coupling between the Fe centers is also active in that sample, albeit about 40% smaller than the one determined for Fe-T4PT. Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows XAS and XMCD spectra of a Co-T4PB sample at the Co L 2,3 edges, taken at 8 K and in a field of 5 T for four different incidence angles. The large XMCD signal and the angle dependence point towards an S = 3/2 high-spin state with an in-plane easy axis. A similarly large XMCD signal was observed also for Co in Co-T4CPT networks. No coupling was found for any of the Co networks studied, i.e., Co-T4CPT and Co-T4PB. The reason for the absence of coupling in the Co-based networks needs to be explored theoretically.
