<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report regarding the work done at BM23 according to the proposal (CH3954)</head><p>Exploring the co-component influence on the state of Pd in the gas-phase toluene acetoxylation: A combine study of XANES (Pd L 2,3 -edge) and EXAFS (Pd K-edge) to reveal the geometric and electronic effects Proposal Summary:</p><p>The goal of the present study is to find the geometric effect (often structural) and electronic state of Pd, which can be merely influenced by the presence of co-component and, in turn, affects the catalytic behavior in the gas phase acetoxylaton of toluene. To capture the geometric and electronic effects, XAS measurements at ambient conditions, while activating the samples at 300 °C in air, and more importantly, under the pulse exchange conditions (toluene and acetic acid) could be promising. For these current investigations Pd K-edge EXAFS at BM23 and Pd L</p><p>2,3 -edges XANES at ID12 are proposed. From EXAFS the geometric affects such as either alloying or incorporation of elements into Pd bulk lattice, metal-metal bond coordination/distances can be explored, whereas from XANES the local changes in the electronic structure like the oxidation state of Pd or d-orbital occupancy could be anticipated. Supporting information from the conventional characterization methods like XRD/XPS/TG-DTA can provide more insights for the present investigation. Additionally, FT-IR surface adsorption experiments with toluene and/or acetic acid were already performed in our laboratory. Besides, the adsorption and activation energies for dissociation of reactant molecules over Pd(111) surface was elucidated with density functional theory (DFT) methods. Proposal Summary is accepted to perform the work only at BM23 Experiment description Activation conditions Catalyst amount -50 mg Activation temperature -300 °C for 1 h 10 % O 2 /He flow -23 ml / min Reaction conditions Reaction pressure -2 bar Reaction temperature -210 °C 10 % O 2 / He flow -18 ml / min Saturator contains single reactant • 18 ml / min of 10 % O 2 was bubbled through saturator which contain either Toluene or Acetic acid • The expected amount of Toluene taken by the gas is 29.8 ml/h (1.33 mmol) in gas phase • The expected amount of Acetic acid taken by the gas is 17.1 ml/h (0.76 mmol) in gas phase Saturator contains mixed reactants (Toluene and Acetic acid) • 18 ml / min of 10 % O 2 was bubbled through saturator which contain 1:4 ratio of Toluene and Acetic acid Pd K edge EXAFS performed under following conditions Results and discussion Quick EXAFS at PdK edge for PdSb/TiO 2 catalyst under Toluene and O 2 Initially, PdSb/TiO 2 catalyst is activated in presence of air at 300 °C for 2h. Quartz capillary reactor system was used for the XAS measurements. To check influence of the individual reactants and the gas medium on the structure of the Pd, initially toluene along with the O 2 is passed on to the sample. Quick EXAFS at PdK edge measurements were performed for 30 min while increase in the reaction pressure from 1 bar to 2 bar. The XANES results along with the K 2 weighted Fourier transforms are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. It is remarkable to know that the PdCl 2 (the precursor in the catalyst) is restructured to metallic Pd within 30 min of the toluene exposure; on further (6 h) no appreciable change to the structure is noticed. We supposed that the structural modifications are happening to the catalyst under 5 h of reaction stream. But the current XAS investigation gave a clear hint for the formation metallic Pd in the PdSb/TiO 2 especially under Tolune flow. On the other hand, similar experiment was performed for similar catalyst but consists of Mn instead of Sb (PdMn/TiO 2 ). The results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. It is surprisingly to know that the structure of PdCl 2 modified to metallic Pd and PdO. It indicates the fact that the co-component vicinity to the Pd plays also a major role on the reducibility of the Pd atoms. Clealry, Sb in presence of toluene stabilizing the metallic Pd, whereas Mn modified the metallic Pd to PdO. Quick EXAFS at PdK edge for PdSb/TiO 2 catalyst under Acetic acid and O 2 Fig. 3 a) Normalized Pd K EXAFS, b) K 2 weighted Fourier transform of the PdSb/TiO 2 catalysts under Acetic acid and molecular oxygen.</p><p>Secondly, to check influence of the acetic acid besides toluene, Quick EXAFS at PdK edge measurements for PdSb/TiO 2 were performed while increase in the reaction pressure from 1 bar to 2 bar. The XANES results along with the K 2 weighted Fourier transforms are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In contrast to results obtained under the influence of toluene, here, there is no apparent change to the PdCl 2 structure is noticed. Hence, the formation of metallic Pd is clearly avoided. From the current result, we can say that acetic acid or Sb are incapable to direct the formation of metallic Pd from PdCl 2 . Besides, similar experiments at PdMn/TiO 2 showed interesting feature, which are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. To our surprise, the PdCl 2 modified to metallic Pd within 30 min of exposure of acetic acid. It shows that Mn plays a major role on the reducibility of the Pd from PdCl 2 but further promoting the oxidation of formed metallic Pd. </p></div>
