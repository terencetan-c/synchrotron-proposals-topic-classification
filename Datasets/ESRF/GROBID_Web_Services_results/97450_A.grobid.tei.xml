<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Innovative mixed oxide (MOX) (U,Pu)O2-x fuels for both thermal and fast neutron reactors are currently studied within the framework of the development of a more sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. In order to improve and ensure the safety of a power plant, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the properties of the (U,Pu)O2x fuel at every stage of its life inside the reactor. Due to fission, for each actinide cation (U, Pu, …) consumed, two lighter nuclei are formed, called Fission Products (FP). Most of these elements have largely different chemical behaviour with respect to U or Pu, thus they change significantly both the thermo-physical and microstructural properties of the pristine fuel during its lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In order to overcome the limitations associated with the irradiated fuel radiotoxicity, model materials called "SIMfuel" have been developed. SIMfuels are manufactured with the same process used for fresh fuel but the material is doped with stable isotopes of radioactive fission products. SIMfuels have therefore reduced radiotoxicity, and allow to study separately the effects of selected FPs. Traditionally SIMfuel is fabricated without Pu <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, thus its applicability to real irradiated MOX fuel is therefore limited. The presence of Pu inside the matrix has been proven to have deep consequences on the chemical, physical, and microstructural properties of the material. Contrary to uranium, plutonium can be present in a reduced state (Pu+3) which has a strong impact on both local oxygen stoichiometry and local redox equilibrium. The study of Pu-bearing SIMfuel (or SIMMOx) is thus critical to the understanding of the MOx fuel behaviour during irradiation.</p><p>For this study, we employ SIMMOx doped with 11 non-radioactive isotopes of fission products. Those are divided into three categories based on their behaviour in irradiated fuel, namely: FPs soluble in the oxide matrix, FPs found in metallic precipitates, and Ba, which has been correlated to the formation of a wide range of oxide precipitates. To our knowledge, this is the first study on SIMMOx with this large variety of FPs. Samples from all compositions have been annealed at specific temperatures and atmospheres (oxygen potential) corresponding to nominal and accidental conditions. Two batches of SIMfuel samples have been fabricated at CEA Marcoule with the following compositions (called S and M) given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> below (g/g %).</p><p>Table 1 Mass (g/g%) concentration of each element in the two composition studied. The difference from 100% represents the oxygen content.</p><p>On each batch, different thermal treatments were applied in order to simulate different temperatures (1100 -1700 °C) and oxygen potential conditions (from -6 to -500 kJ/mol), corresponding to different nominal and accidental conditions such as Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA).</p><p>The name and characteristics of the thermal treatments is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. The total number of samples was then 8, having two different compostion to which four thermal treatments were applied. Moreover, some reference samples have been added in order to help in the data interpretation, bringing the total number of studied samples to 13. The sample naming scheme is strightforward: composition name + annealing name, e.g. the sample M-ST corresponds to the sample with composition M to which conditions ST have been applied.</p><p>For each sample, fluorescence and transmission signal have been collected for all elements in the material. The studied edges are ULIII, PuLIII, AmLIII, YK, ZrK, MoK, RuK, RhK, PdK, and SrK. A problem of vacuum in the synchrotron ring caused the loss of about 10 shifts over the total of 18 assigned. This issue forced us to collect only XANES signal, and post-pone the EXAFS collection to future experiments. Finally, the quality of the collected signal on the sample M-OX is insufficient to perform any analysis. This is probably due to a previously undetected problem encountered during the XAS sample fabrication.</p><p>First, we collected XANES spectra at the U, Pu and Am LIII edge in order to determine the O/M ratio of these species as consequence of different annealing conditions (temperature and oxygen potential). Example of XANES signals collected is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (ULIII edge). With XANES data we were able to obtain the average oxidation state of each actinide (U, Pu, Am) in the samples, and then compute the O/M ratio, resumed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. As shown from the results, Am is always found in +3 state, regardless of fabrication temperature and oxygen potential. This is suggesting that Am is always found in its +3 state in nuclear fuel, in all the range of parameters studied.</p><p>Furthermore, for all samples the ratios O/U and O/Pu are always &gt;2 and &lt;2 respectively, showing the presence of both U(V) and Pu(III). This particular phenomenon is still under investigation, but our data strongly suggest the presence of U(V) even in regime of hypostoichiometry (O/M&lt;2), and the presence of Pu(III) even in hyperstoichiometry (O/M&gt;2). Lastly, the XANES signal has been collected at the K-edges of Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Sr, Zr, and Y. Thermodynamical modelling shows that Pd, Ru, and Rh should always be in their metallic state, forming intermetallic alloys <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This is confirmed by the data for all the samples containing them (M-ST, M-RE, M-AC)</p><p>The other dopants exhibit peculiar behaviour, due to their rich chemistry. The data concerning these elements are still being treated. Future experiments for the acquisition of the EXAFS signal will help the interpretation of the XANES dat collected during this experience.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 XANES</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 XANES ULIII spectra of selected samples and references.On the left a comparison between the samples S-ST and M-ST with the main U compounds of interest.
