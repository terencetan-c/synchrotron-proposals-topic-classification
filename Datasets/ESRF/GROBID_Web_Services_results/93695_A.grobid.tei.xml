By subtracting the initial PDF of pristine amorphous silicon from the PDFs obtained during the operando experiment we can see changes in the structure, even with minimal amounts of lithium alloyed (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The almost complete disappearance of of the 3.8 Å peak in the difference PDF and the growth of the 2.85 Å peak agree with the literature measurements of ex situ PDFs. The difference method allows us to pick out trends which are almost invisible in the untreated PDF series. The number of data points in the operando experiment confirms that these observations are real trends, not just noise.</p><p>To conclude, we believe this experiment has shown the high sensitivity of TSCT for a weakly scattering material with a complex mechanism in a battery which did not perform very well. The less than 10 % lithiation is still observable. A manuscript based on the results is in preparation. </p></div>			</div>
