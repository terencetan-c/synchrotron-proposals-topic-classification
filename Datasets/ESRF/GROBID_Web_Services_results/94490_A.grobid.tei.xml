In particular we have performed the structural characterization of as-prepared (out of equilibrium), ex-situ and in-situ thermally annealed films deposited on flat and nano-curved substrates, consisting of nanoparticle monolayers deposited on a flat substrate. ID 10 beamline perfectly fitted to our experimental plans thanks to the possibility to easily switch from GISAXS to GID configuration and the sufficiently long sample-to-detector distance enabling the determination of the lowq GISAXS signals. Sample thermal annealing was performed in-vacuum with excellent temperature control, however, very special care was to put on the vacuum inside the sample chamber since, from time-to-time, we observed significant sample oxidation caused by residual oxygen in the chamber. As-prepared samples showed the expected low degree of crystallinity. However, although the &lt;100&gt; diffraction signal appeared always as a ring, on the flat substrate higher intensity is observed along qz and qxy direction respectively, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> a, suggesting that crystals predominantly adopt the two well known orientation, edge-on and face-on. On the other hand, on nano-curved substrates, the intensity of &lt;100&gt; peak is homogenous along the whole ring (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b-f</ref>). This suggests that crystal deposition spin-coating, although leading to random</p><p>a) b) c) d) e) f) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 10 Intensity(a.u.)

In other words, the few crystals formed during the fast solvent evaporation tend to stick to the substrates by adhesion of one of the crystalline faces. This leads, in the case of the flat substrates, to the presence of two main crystal orientations having, respectively, the polymer backbone parallel (edge-on) or perpendicular (flat-on) to the substrate plane. On the other hand, on nano-curved substrates, the adhesion of the crystal faces on the curved portions of nano-curved substrates leads to an isotropic orientation of the polymer backbone with respect to the substrate plane. This homogeneous distribution of crystals is expected to be responsible for the observed higher electrical conductivity of polymer films deposited on nanocurved substrates which we reported in the proposal of the present experiment. Upon thermal-annealing, P3HT is known to adopt almost exclusively the edge-on orientation, that is, the polymer backbone is laying parallel to the substrate plane, as confirmed by the high &lt;100 &gt; peak intensity along the qz direction for samples deposited on flat substrates (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.g. (black plot)). Vice-versa, on nano-curved substrates the conformal adhesion of polymer lamellae to particles leads to both edge-on and flat-on orientation, as revealed by the simultaneous presence of &lt;100&gt; and &lt;020&gt; peaks along the qz direction (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.g). Indeed, due to the curvature, the same lamella gives rise to both edge-on orientation, from the portion laying on the top of particles, and to flat-on one from the portion adhering to the equatorial region of particles. The in-situ structural characterization was employed to determine other differences which may appear between flat and nano-curved substrates during thermal annealing. In particular, as the crystal growth on curved substrates is expected to induce structural distortion and, as a consequence, lower crystallization enthalpies, we monitored, during cooling, the temperatureat which Bragg peaks appear.</p><p>As a matter of fact, on flat substrates the peak appeared at 200°C (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>), in agreement with what observed previously in literature, while on nano-curved ones the crystallization temperatures are lower (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>), ranging between 170 and 150°C. Although the limited experimental time, accentuated by the remote mode which prevented us to entirely exploit the 24 hours of a day, did not allow the study of the comprehensive effect of the nano-curvature, that is of the particle diameter, on the crystallization temperature lowering, our results unambigoulsy show that P3HT crystals grown on nano-curved substrates are clearly distorted and that this distortion reflects on a lower crystallization temperature. Finally, in order to investigate the combined effect of nano-curvature and SFE on the P3HT crystallization, we performed the in-situ GID characterization on substrates characterized by constant nano-curvature but different <ref type="bibr">SFE (63.98,</ref><ref type="bibr">55.49 and 43.56</ref> mN/m respectively). At the lowest SFE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.c), the &lt;100&gt; Bragg peak appears at 200°C again, suggesting dewetting from the low SFE curved portion of the substrates and growth of undistorted crystals taking place exclusively in the interstices between them. By increasing the SFE, the Bragg peak &lt;100&gt; appears at a lower temperature, which suggests the crystal growth not only in the interstices between the particles but also in the curved portion, resulting in the formation of distorted crystals. The above implies the presence of an energy gain that balances the loss of crystallization enthalpy resulting from the growth of distorted crystals.</p><p>In order to verify the hypothesis of the change from the full retraction to full wetting with the increase of SFE, the analysis of GISAXS data is currently ongoing, as the dewetting is expected to increase the contrast of the nanoparticles monolayer form factor.</p><p>0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 10 4 10 5 Intensity (a.u.)
