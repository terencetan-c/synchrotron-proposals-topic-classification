<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Core/shell semiconductor nanocrystals are widely studied nowadays because of their prospective application in photovoltaics and photoelectronics. The aim of the experiment was to study the growth of Ge/Si and Si/Ge nanoparticles Ge/Si/Al 2 O 3 and Si/Ge/Al 2 O 3 multilayers by magnetron sputtering by x-ray reflection and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAXS method) in situ during deposition. For the deposition we used the magnetron growth chamber attached to the large sample goniometer at the BM20 beamline. For the growth we used two magnetron systems, namely a DC system for Si and Ge deposition with the power of 100W as well as rf magnetron for the deposition of alumina (20 W), Ar was used as a working gas. During the growth, the sample was irradiated by a focused primary beam with the wavelength of 1.083 Å. The scattered beam was detected by a linear detector MYTHEN1K mounted on the delta/nu arm of the goniometer in the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. We deposited a series of multilayers on Si substrates with the periods Al 2 O 3 /Ge/Si and Al 2 O 3 /Si/Ge, in each deposition run we deposited 10 periods. During the growth we measured specular and diffuse x-ray reflection keeping constant the incidence angle  i = 1deg; one detector frame corresponds to the distribution of scattered intensity for various exit angles  f and the same azimuthal direction nu = 0. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the example of a time/ f intensity map measured during the growth of the sequence Al 2 O 3 /Ge/Si. Fig. 2 The time dependence of the specular reflectivity extracted from the data plotted in Fig. 1</p><p>The sharp maximum in the intensity map at  i = f = 1deg corresponds to the specularly reflected beam; broad stripes at  f  0.4 deg and 1.6 deg are the Bragg sheets caused by the correlation of the random roughness profiles at various interfaces in the multilayer <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. From the intensity map we extracted the timedependence of the specular reflectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). After completion of the growth we measured a standard specular reflection curve (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) and a GISAXS intensity map. For the GISAXS maps we used a nu-scan with constant incidence angle  i = 0.2 deg close to the critical angle of total external reflection. Each detector frame in the GISAXS measurement corresponds to a distribution of scattered intensity with given azimuthal angle nu and various exit angles  f . Finally we converted the intensity distribution to reciprocal space (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>Satellite maxima in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> indicate the presence of a self-order three-dimensional array of nanoparticles; the apparent zigzag pattern of the maxima corresponds to an ABAB or ABCABC-type of particle stacking at subsequent multilayer interfaces. After the growth we also measured a fast WAXS scan to detect the presence of crystalline particles. For this measurement we used the same linear detector and performed a fast delta-scan. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> presents an example of the WAXS scan along with the theoretical positions of the Ge and Si diffraction maxima</p><p>The analysis of the experimental data is still in progress. From the data we determine the time evolution of the morphology of the growing surface and the evolution of the ordering of the nanoparticles during deposition. From the comparison of the results obtained during the growth of Al 2 O 3 /Ge/Si and Al 2 O 3 /Si/Ge sequences we will analyse the wetting/dewetting properties f Si/Ge and Ge/Si interfaces.</p><p>[1] Holý V., Baumbach T., <ref type="bibr">Phys.
