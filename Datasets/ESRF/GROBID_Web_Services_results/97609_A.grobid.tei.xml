<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment, we aimed to characterize the high pressure behaviour of poly-carbon monoxide (p-CO) under laser heating using CO2 laser. Our previous XRD and IR studies showed how poly-CO was stabilized up to 50 GPa in an extended 3D network of mostly single-bonded carbon atoms, in good agreement with the previous theoretical calculations. These same calculations predicted the stability of crystalline pCO phases that were never experimentally synthesized due to the probable kinetic hindrance of the amorphous-crystalline transformation. This experiment was thus designed with the twofold purpose of 1) extending our previous XRD and IR results on amorphous poly-CO to higher pressure (possibly exceeding the Megabar) and 2) verifying the possibility to obtain crystalline poly-CO following laser heating (1000-4000 K) at very high pressure.</p><p>We cryo-loaded the CO samples at LENS, using three DACs provided by ESRF. The DACs were equipped with diamond anvils suitable to perform compression and laser heating on three samples up to 60-80 GPa (experiment 1CO, 250 μm culets) and up to 120-150 GPa (experiments 2CO and 3CO, 150/300 μm culets). We preindented and drilled the sample chambers into Re gaskets that were afterwards gilded with gold by Au sputtering in ESRF, so to protect the sample avoiding as much as possible its direct contact with the metal (Re) in order to exclude any catalytic effect during the experiments. We prepared the three samples with initial pressures of 30 GPa (1CO), 37 GPa (2CO) and 22 GPa (3CO). The formation of poly-CO was checked by Raman spectroscopy and visual inspection of the samples prior to begin the experiment in ESRF.</p><p>The 1CO sample was compressed to 50 GPa, and then laser heated at this pressure several times with increasing incident power. The coupling of the laser with the target poly-CO was not very good, and no major changes were observed in the XRD patterns. Using almost full power of the CO2 laser we eventually obtained a better coupling and a transformation in the sample; nevertheless, the poly-CO sample seemed to decompose rather than crystallize, and this was attested by the appearance of the characteristic XRD pattern of CO2-V, the crystalline phase of CO2 that is stable at this pressure conditions. Unfortunately, we lacked a reliable temperature measurement for this threshold.</p><p>To better characterize the temperature condition of the poly-CO decomposition we compressed the sample for the 2CO experiment up to 50 GPa and laser heated it again at this pressure. Pressure increased upon heating up to about 70 GPa, but we observed again the CO2-V signatures in the XRD pattern acquired after laser heating, and we measured the temperature as comprised between 3150 and 3400 K. Upon a subsequent heating at higher laser power (resulting in a further pressure increase up to 75 GPa), we reached a temperature of about 3600 K and succeded in further converting the remaining poly-CO into its decomposition products (CO2-V and C, this one yet not being visible in the XRD patterns and probably amorphous).</p><p>The last sample (3CO) was compressed to Megabar (about 100 GPa) and laser heated at this conditions. We performed three different laser heatings with increasing incident laser power, and we observed a far better coupling, reaching temperature between 2400 and 2800 K (final pressure reached about 120 GPa). We did not observe any signature of a crystalization of poly-CO in these conditions. To improve the laser coupling with the target, we tried to decompress down to 85 GPa and to perform further heatings at this pressure. Here we reached higher temperatures (up to 4000 K) but we did observe nothing else than the comparison of Bragg peaks that can be related to CO2-V, thus again attesting for the decomposition of poly-CO.</p><p>The results of these experiments pose some constraints to the future simulations on this system, evidencing how amorphous poly-Co tends to decompose into CO2 and C instead of undergoing conversion in a stable, crystalline form. The kinetic hindrance of the conversion process seems therefore to be much higher than the kinetic barrier towards the decomposition. Despite we carefully prepared and gilded the Re gasket with gold, it is not clear if Re could have been involved and had some catalytic effect on the decomposition process (Re gaskets was goldsputtered to protect them, but the very thin Au layer of about 100 nm could have been damaged in the various steps of the cell preparation and sample loading).</p><p>We are currently analyzing the XRD data obtained from these experiments. Moreover, we brought one cell back to LENS to measure Raman spectra on the obtained product (decomposed poly-CO) during decompression.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Demetrio Scelta, LENS and ICCOM-CNR* Dr. Mario Santoro, LENS and INO-CNR* Prof. Roberto Bini, LENS and Department of Chemistry, University of Florence* Dr. Matteo Ceppatelli, LENS and ICCOM-CNR*</figDesc></figure>
