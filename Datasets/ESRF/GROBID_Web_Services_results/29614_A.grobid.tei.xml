<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>New valuable information about the formation of nanoparticles of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide during oxidative and reductive pretreatments of cobalt silica supported Fischer-Tropsch catalysts has been obtained during the X-ray absorption experiments performed in November 2004. A new X-ray absorption cell dedicated to in situ and operando experiments in heterogeneous catalysis was built and successfully tested for in situ characterization of cobalt silica supported catalysts.</p><p>Two papers have been written and accepted for publication.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of the present proposal is to characterize by in situ XANES/EXAFS the evolution of cobalt local coordination during transformation of cobalt salts supported by silica into small clusters of cobalt oxides or cobalt silicate and then into cobalt metal particles during oxidative and reductive pretreatments of cobalt silica supported Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. A new in situ X-ray absorption cell designed in our laboratory was used for data collection.</p><p>The cobalt promoted and unpromoted catalysts were prepared by aqueous (co)-impregnation using cobalt nitrate or acetate, ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate or perrhenic acid. Cab-osil M-5 fumed silica (S BET =214 m 2 /g) was used as catalytic support in all catalyst preparations. Prior to impregnation Cab-osil M5 was agglomerated by wetting and dried at 373 K. The precursors of promoters are ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate in HNO 3 (Ru=1.5 wt. %) or perrhenic acid. They were used as a co-impregnating salt for preparation of promoted catalysts. The contents of cobalt and promoting noble metal in the catalysts were respectively 8-10 wt. % and 0.1-0.2 wt. % .</p><p>Two types of experiments were carried out. First, the X-ray absorption spectra at Co K-edge of the eight cobalt catalysts precalcined in our laboratories and of five cobalt reference compounds were measured.</p><p>Then, the in situ decomposition of cobalt precursor and the in situ reduction of oxidized cobalt species in three cobalt catalysts were carried out at Co K-edge using our new in situ Xray absorption cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Below is a brief description of the new X-ray cell. The cell consists of several plates of stainless steel and boron nitride linked together using graphite seals. The components of the cell are held together with 8 screws. The use of homemade plates of boron nitride (made from bulk boron nitride -MCSE, Grade A) allows minimizing X-ray absorption by the cell. To reduce further X-ray absorption by boron nitride at lower photon energies (~7keV) the length of the beam path in boron nitride has to be reduced and the plate was drilled from the rear side. To perform X-ray absorption measurements, the plates of boron nitride and stainless steel have to be assembled and sealed using graphite foils of 2 mm thickness (Carbone Lorraine). Our experiments have shown that the cell is leak-free at atmospheric pressure in pure oxygen or pure hydrogen at temperatures respectively from ambient to 623 and 673 K. The catalyst for X-ray absorption measurements in the form of compacted powder is loaded in the hollow of the plate of boron nitride. The cell is equipped with a system of gas circulation, thermocouple and heating elements. Two holes were drilled on each of boron nitride plates and graphite foils (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) to constitute the gas flow channel (one for inlet and the other for outlet). The gas flow from the top to the bottom through the catalyst powder is essential in the design of cells for in situ or operando X-ray absorption measurements. The cell is heated by two heating cartridges placed inside the boron nitride plate (sample holder, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Due to the high thermal conductivity (30-100 W/m K) of boron nitride, the heat is supplied uniformly to the catalyst. In order to ensure good thermal contact, the thermocouple is placed close to the catalyst sample in a hole drilled in the boron nitride plate. The in situ cell operates with a programmable temperature controller, which enables performing well-controlled temperature ramps in the range 293-673 K, with very low temperature gradients (&lt; 1 K). The cell can be shielded and continuously purged with nitrogen if hydrogen or any other explosive gases are used. The representative in situ XANES spectra and Fourier transform EXAFS moduli for cobalt supported catalysts acquired using the new X-ray cell during the pretreatments in the flow of air and in the flow of hydrogen at different temperatures are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The data display major evolution of cobalt local coordination during the pretreatments. The quality of X-ray absorption data was excellent, much better than in our previous experiments at cobalt K-edge, which involved the synchrotron beam generated by LURE (Orsay).</p><p>The X-ray absorption results were analyzed using crystalline cobalt acetate, cobalt nitrate hydrates, Co 3 O 4 , CoO, Co foil, α-and β-cobalt silicate as standard compounds. X-ray absorption study showed that in both unpromoted and Ru and Re-promoted cobalt catalysts after impregnation and drying, cobalt is present mainly in octahedrally coordinated complexes. Decomposition of octahedrally coordinated cobalt complexes leads to easily reducibly crystallites of Co 3 O 4 and amorphous cobalt silicate. The repartition of cobalt species between Co 3 O 4 and cobalt silicate depends essentially on the exothermicity and temperature of decomposition of precursor decomposition. Cobalt nitrate precursor, with an endothermic decomposition, favors Co 3 O 4 crystallites. Cobalt acetate precursor, with an exothermic decomposition, favors cobalt silicate. Slow decomposition of cobalt acetate at low temperatures (443-493 K) results in the fraction of cobalt silicate being decreased. This favors the more reducible Co 3 O 4 phase. For the catalysts prepared from cobalt nitrate, promotion with ruthenium results in smaller Co 3 O 4 particle sizes, while maintaining high reducibility after treatment with hydrogen at 400°C. For the catalyst prepared via low temperature decomposition of cobalt acetate, addition of ruthenium increases the fraction of Co 3 O 4 crystalline phase and decreases the concentration of barely reducible cobalt silicate and thus enhances cobalt reducibility and the number of cobalt metal sites.
