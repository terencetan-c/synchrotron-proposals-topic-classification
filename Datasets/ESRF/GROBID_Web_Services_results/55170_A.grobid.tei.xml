<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the allocated beamtime we investigated the influence of size effects on the phonon properties. Our aim was to specifically concentrate on the Debye level of low dimensional materials, such as Fe nanowires grown in amorphous alumina templates using a novel electrodeposition technique. The used alumina templates had controlled pore diameter which provided nanowires with homogeneous diameter.</p><p>We measured nuclear forward and inelastic scattering spectra at ID18/ESRF using a high resolution monochromator with instrumental resolution of 0.5 meV. The measurements were carried out in two directions, i.e., with the incident beam parallel and perpendicular to the nanowire axis. This was done in order to identify potential anisotropy in the vibrational properties of our systems. However, as it is expected from the isotropic crystallographic unit cell of α-Fe anisotropicity was not observed.</p><p>The data acquisition procedure was smooth and the quality of the obtained data was exceptional. The measured raw nuclear forward scattering is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The obtained density of phonon states is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The nuclear forward scattering spectra are similar and independent from the nanowire diameter. Only the sample with 40 nm diameter wires appears to have different beating than all the other samples. After a detailed analysis of the raw data we could identify impurity phases which had hyperfine parameters different than that of pure α-Fe not only for the 40 nm diameter wires but also for the other nanowires.</p><p>The nuclear forward scattering data were corroborated with Mossbauer data. The Mossbauer data were obtained in order to resolve potential impurity phases which mainly contribute in the unresolved time, before 10 ns, in the nuclear forward spectra. A model was developed with which both nuclear forward spectra and Mossbauer data were fitted simultaneously. We were able finally to obtain a quantified analysis of the impurity phases.</p><p>The density of phonon states seem to have no strong diameter dependence in the examined diameter range, between 20 and 180 nm, except for the 40 nm samples where significant impurity phases were identified.</p><p>However, the obtained density of phonon states of Fe nanowires is different than the analogous measured in bulk samples as well as the one obtained from first principle theoretical calculations, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Nevertheless clear phonon peaks at energies higher than the cut-off energies for α-Fe, i.e., at ~40 meV, are not observed up to 70 meV, which indicate that foreign Fe phases should not be present in the samples. However, this observation contradicts the nuclear forward scattering spectra obtained on the same samples. Combining the results obtained in this study with further investigations (Mossbauer spectroscopy, diffraction using synchrotron radiation, and SEM, TEM) we can conclude that, although phonon confinement in Fe nanowires with diameter down to 20 nm may not play the major rοle, there is definitely a change in the elastic properties which is probably related with the sample preparation procedure and results in a dramatic change in the thermal properties by a factor of 8.
