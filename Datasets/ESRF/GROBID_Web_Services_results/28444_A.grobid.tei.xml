<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Systematic in-situ XAFS investigation of binary and ternary electrocatalysts in fuel cell operation Experiment number: ME-846 Beamline: BM29 Date of experiment: from: 16/06/04 to: 21/06/04 Date of report: 30/07/04 Shifts: Local contact(s): O. Mathon Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Christina Roth*, Nathalie Martz*, Marian Mazurek*, Frieder Scheiba* Institute for Materials Science TU Darmstadt Petersenstr. 23 D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany Report: Systematic in-situ XAFS investigation of binary and ternary electrocatalysts in fuel cell operation Aim:</p><p>A special in-situ cell has been developed to enable X-ray absorption measurements during fuel cell operation.</p><p>The main aim of these investigations is to pursue potential-and fuel-dependent structural (EXAFS) and electronic (AXAFS) changes of the anode catalyst. Beamline BM29 is especially suited for these experiments, as it is equipped with an excellent fluorescence detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements and improvements compared with last beamtime (ME-608):</head><p>Four different membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared for the XAS measurements: a) with a carbon-supported Pt-Ru alloy anode catalyst, b) with a mixture of carbon-supported Pt and carbon-supported Ru as anode catalyst, c) with an unsupported Pt-Ru alloy catalyst and d) with a ternary carbon-supported PtRuMo catalyst. All MEAs were operated first with pure hydrogen and in a second series with a H 2 /150 ppm CO feed, and spectra were recorded at different potentials at the Pt L 3 -and the Ru K-edge. In order to complement the in-situ measurements one spectrum was taken before and one after operation at elevated temperatures but without gas feed. Approximately 80 spectra were recorded during the beamtime, which will be analysed in detail over the next months.</p><p>One main improvement of this beamtime over the previous one is shown in fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Last year, a strange preedge feature appeared in the Pt spectra which could not be explained (black line, see also report ME-608).</p><p>Moreover, the overall edge height was comparatively small. These drawbacks were greatly enhanced as the cell's Be window was replaced by a thick Kapton  foil resulting in a much higher intensity and an improved resolution. It is assumed that a W impurity in the Be window caused the strange pre-edge signal which is no longer present in the new spectra (red line). The optimum set-up for our experiments was found to be the commercial fuel cell hardware with a Kapton  foil beam window in fluorescence geometry (fig. 2). Fig.2. Set-up of the in-situ cell in fluorescence geometry In Figure 3 some preliminary results at the Ru K-edge are presented. 22100 22200 22300 22400 22500 0,000 0,002 0,004 0,006 0,008 0,010 Ru ex-situ Ru in-situ Ru nachher norm. Intensität Energie / eV Fig. 3.</p><p>Ru spectra before, during and after fuel cell operation Significant differences between the spectrum before operation and the ones during and after operation are revealed. Before operation, most of the ruthenium in the catalyst is oxidized (black line). But after contact with the fuel, ruthenium is completely reduced, and the spectrum resembles one of metallic Ru nanoparticles.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, the fitted Fourier transforms (FT) of Pt before and during hydrogen operation are shown. The preliminary results are summarized in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Upon the first contact of the catalyst with the fuel, significant changes take place in the number of Pt-Pt, Pt-Ru and Pt-O nearest neighbours (N values). The findings suggest the (partial) reduction of surface oxides existing on the air oxidized catalyst particles before operation. During operation, further changes in the number of Pt-Pt and Pt-Ru contributions were observed with increasing potential but of much smaller magnitude. Measurements of a supported and an unsupported Pt-Ru alloy catalyst closely resemble each other. The particle size increases slightly during operation, while the number of Pt-O contributions decreases from N Pt-O =1.4 to 0.3. This is in good agreement with the decreased white-line intensity in operation. Furthermore, the number of Pt-Ru nearest neighbours increases with potential. It is assumed that ruthenium oxides on the particle surfaces become reduced during operation, and ruthenium atoms "move" inside the particles to form a more homogeneous alloy. The as-received catalysts (ex-situ, before operation) show strained Pt-Pt and Pt-Ru distances, possibly associated with the small particle sizes. However, r Pt-Pt and r Pt-Ru approach their equilibrium values during operation. * ∆s is higher for the in-situ sample associated with the elevated working temperatures. Now that the in-situ cell and instrumental method is established, more complex investigations are planned in a future proposal.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1,2 1,4 1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4 2,6 2,8 3,0 3,2 3,4 -0,4 -0,3 -0,2 -0,1 0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 FT / Angstrom -2 R / Angstrom 1,2 1,4 1,6 1,8 2,0 2,2 2,4 2,6 2,8 3,0 3,2 3,4 -0,4 -0,3 -0,2 -0,1 0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 FT / Angstrom -2 R / Angstrom</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Fig. 1.Comparison of Pt spectra with and without Be window in cell</figDesc></figure>
