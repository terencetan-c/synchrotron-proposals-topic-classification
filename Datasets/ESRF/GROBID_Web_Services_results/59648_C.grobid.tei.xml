<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Imaging of aggregating alpha-synuclein in a celluar model of Parkinson's disease and human Lewy Bodies. One of the most prominent histological hallmark of PD is the presence of protein aggregates named Lewy Bodies (LB) that are mainly formed by a protein called alpha-synuclein (aSyn). The aSyn contained in the aggregates is thought to be misfolded and enriched in beta-strand 1 . Moreover characteristic of PD is the accumulation of iron (Fe) in the substantia nigra, which is the area of the brain where the neuronal loss occurs massively in the disease.</p><p>In our experiment we analyzed 30 µm histological sections of substantia nigra from PD patient and nonparkinsoninan control in order to study the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the X-ray fluorescence on native tissue looking for possible bio-markers. The tissue was obtained from the UK brain bank and it was cut in cryo-conditions and then the samples were left to dry in order to keep the tissue as close as possible to the native state.</p><p>Experimental parameters used: Energy [keV]:13; Focal spot size [µm x µm]: 2.7 x 2; I0 [cps]: 9.9 x 10 11 ; Detector distance [m]: 0.139 (WAXS) or 0.857 (SAXS); Detector: Eiger 4M; Pixel: 2070 x 2167; Pixel size [µm]: 75; Fluorescence detector: Vortex EM X-ray detector; Energy resolution [eV]: &lt;130; Calibration Standards: Al2O3 / AgBh. Out of 40 scans analyzed, 12</p><p>Ctr scans and 28 PD scans were merged together and normalized for the intensity, while the other scans were used as background. As Zn appeared to be mostly inside the cells, its intensity was used to set thresholds to separate intracellular content from the extracellular content. The quantification was done by comparing the areas of the fitting of the different elements in PyMCA: (PD-CTR)/CTR. The relative quantification of the trace metals contained in the SN tissue revealed a higher concentration of Fe and a decreased concentration of Cu in PD samples compared to its CTR (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The amounts of Cu and Fe are in line with previous studies 2 . Fe forms deposits that are mostly localized in the extracellular space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1 Relative amounts of trace elements in the SN of the PD samples vs Ctr samples</head><p>The scans were also analyzed for the X-ray diffraction patterns. In some areas of the scans we had a higher diffraction signal in the wide angle range. Therefore we set at qr &gt; 5 nm -1 and intensity &gt; 50 counts as threshold for areas with or without a WAXS signal. Then we took the maximum intensity value of each pixel in the diffraction patterns from all the scans to get the maximum projection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). The sum was done for the diffraction patterns over threshold (with a signal in the WAXS range) as well as for those that didn't have a signal in the WAXS range and were considered under threshold. The angular average of the peaks was calculated over the maximum projections of all the scans above and below threshold. The peaks in SAXS range are similar for both the maximum projections over or under threshold, but when the whole range is taken into account there are a number of peaks that appear only in the WAXS range that could be typical of the protein(s) that caused the signal. Moreover, the areas displaying the strongest presence of WAXS signals are quasi-exclusively in the samples coming from the PD patients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). The exact nature of what could cause the presence of crystallites is still under analysis, even if we can already exclude that the signal is arising from the substrate used to support the tissue. In fact, we used polypropylene and Si3N4 for PD and Ctr samples as well but the same signal arises in the WAXS regardless of the substrate used for the acquisition of the diffraction patterns. Our study confirms increased Fe levels in PD brains and a decreased level of Cu but adds an improved spatial resolution and identifies the extracellular space as most affected compartment. This study could show for the first time to our knowledge the presence of highly ordered structures in post mortem tissue of PD patients using x-ray-imaging methods. Although the precise nature of the highly ordered molecular structures could not be revealed in this study, XRD visualized tissue properties, which are inaccessible to conventional microscopy. Whether these diffraction patterns can be used as a biomarker will have to be determined in further studies.</p><p>1. Araki, K. et al.
