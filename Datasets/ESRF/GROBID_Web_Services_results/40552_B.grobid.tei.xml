<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments were performed along the lines of our proposal, focussing on in situ and real-time growth studies of organic molecules. Since the data analysis is still in progress, we can only report the most important findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single layers</head><p>As described in the proposal, the first step in our experiment was the production and charakterization of thin films of the p-conductor diindenoperylene (DIP) on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates.</p><p>Post-growth specular reflectivity data of three DIP films evaporated at different substrate temperatures are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. As expected the structural order and roughness exhibit a strong temperature dependence. Films grown at 300 K and 400 K show an out-of-plane lattice spacing of 1.65 nm corresponding to the DIP σ-phase, for which the DIP molecules are nearly upright standing on the substrate. The film grown at lower temperature (200 K) however shows no Bragg reflection in the q z direction. The lower crystallinity of films grown at lower temperatures result in much lower surface roughness, which can be extracted from the Kiessig-oscillations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 -11 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 10 -5 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 σ-phase Reflectivity q z [A -1 ] T = 400 K T = 300 K T = 200 K 20 nm DIP on ITO 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 σ-phase Intensity [arb. units] q xy [A -1 ] T = 400 K T = 300 K T = 200 K 20 nm DIP on ITO λ-phase Additional grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD) scans shown in Fig.1 b reveal the in-plane structure and phase composition of the grown films.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heterostructures</head><p>As a second step the organic n-type semiconductor perfluoropentacene (PFP) was evaporated at 300 K on top of the DIP layers to form an organic heterostructure. X-ray reflectivity and GIXD data from the completed heterstructures were measured. Since the out-of-plane lattice spacing of DIP (d = 1.65 nm) and PFP (d = 1.57 nm) differ only slightly, there specular Bragg reflections are superimposed. One observation is that the intensity of the in-plane and out-of-plane Bragg reflections of PFP may be influenced due to the structure and morphology of the DIP underlayer. In addition, for all growth runs real-time x-ray reflectivity data were measured from which the roughness evolution during film growth can be extracted.</p><p>In the future we will connect this interesting structural discoveries with photovoltaic electrical measurements of the grown heterostructures to probe how the structural properties of the pnheterojunction will influence the transport properties and the photovoltaic efficiency.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent collaboration with the local contact Dr. J. Novak which made this challenging experiment a success.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *A.
