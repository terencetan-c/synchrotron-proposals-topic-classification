<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Following results were achieved from data collected during MX-1705:    Several data set of the fimbrial protein Mfa3 from the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, soaked with NaBr, were collected and used to solve the structure using SAD. Native data was collected to 1.9 Å. The structure gives insights into the assembly and function on this hitherto uncharacterized fimbria.</p><p>Native data of the related fimbrial proteins Mfa1 and Mfa2 were collected to 2.2 and 3.5 Å respectively. The structures could not be solved by molecular replacement and we are therefore planning to grow SeMet labelled crystals.</p><p>Several data sets of the Dps protein Npun_R5799 from the cyanobacteria Nostoc punctiforme soaked with metal ions (Zn 2+ and Fe 2+ ) were successfully collected.</p><p>Native data to 1.4 Å resolution were collected on crystals of the actin binding domain of actinin from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The structure was solved by molecular replacement.</p><p>Several structures of TTR in complex with small molecules were collected.</p><p>One native data of the adhesin domain of the S. pyogenes surface protein AspA was collected to 2.5 Å. Molecular replacement has not been successful, therefore will grow SeMet labelled crystals for structure determination.</p></div>
