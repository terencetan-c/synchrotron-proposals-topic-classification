<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The basic structure of CAS-1 (C2, a = 24.158 Å, b = 7.016 Å, c = 6.482 Å, β = 95.19˚) was solved from data collected on a textured sample <ref type="bibr">(ESRF experiment CH-1318)</ref>, but high-resolution data were needed to complete and refine the structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Such data had been collected in a previous experiment <ref type="bibr">(01-01-265, December 2002)</ref>, but the intensities proved to be distorted by an unexpected preferred orientation of the crystallites in the capillary that could not be described with the simple function used in most Rietveld refinement programs. Therefore a new sample was prepared and remeasured during this run. Subsequent refinement of the structure using these data converged with R F = 0.062, R wp = 0.175 (R exp = 0.097).</p><p>The approximate structure of MDAP-3 (P2 1 /c, a = 14.080 Å, b = 8.4763 Å, c = 18.9954 Å, β = 100.95˚) had been deduced from laboratory data collected on a very small single crystal, but the quality of those data did not allow a satisfactory refinement. Therefore, high-resolution powder diffraction data were collected to confirm and complete the structure. The profile fit for the current status of the Rietveld refinement ( R F = 0.087, R wp = 0.235 (R exp = 0.130)) is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The disorder at one of the two organic molecule positions between the aluminophosphate layers could not be modelled in detail. The calcined IST-1 sample proved to have rather broad peaks and only very low intensity beyond ca 20˚2θ, and structure analysis has not yet been attempted. Manscripts describing the other three results are presently in preparation.</p><p>[1] L. Vidal, J.-L. Paillaud, Z.

As a result, the ideally cubic framework becomes monoclinic (Cc, a = 12.94 Å, b = 12.47 Å, c = 8.63 Å, β = 95.8˚) [1]. Upon removal of water molecules, but not DMF, the c-axis is tripled (Cc, a = 12.820 Å, b = 12.183 Å, c = 26.99 Å, β = 91.4˚). To elucidate the reason for this change, structure analysis of a sample dehydrated under vacuum at 100˚C was undertaken. The very high quality synchrotron data revealed that the DMF molecules had rearranged themselves as the water was removed, resulting in three different kinds of sodalite cages with 9 crystallographically distinct Al and another 9 P sites. In total 275 structural parameters were refined. Refinement converged with R F = 0.047, R wp = 0.045 (R exp = 0.015).</figDesc></figure>
