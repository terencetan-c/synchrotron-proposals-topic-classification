<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this beamtime the temperature-dependent change of the oxidation state of Cerium in rhabdophane was analyzed through in-situ measurements. During a previous beamtime in 2022 at beamline BM20 ex-situ measurements were performed at the end products of the reaction, Ce(IV)-doped monazite. These measurements revealed that though the precipitation reaction started with a tetravalent Cerium compound after heating the precipitated rhabdophane to 800 °C most of the Cerium had turned trivalent. Based on these observations, timeand temperature-resolved experiments were planned in order to study the Cerium reduction more closely and possibly conclude ways to increase the tetravalent portion in the final product.</p><p>Experiments were performed on 4 compositions of the two solid solutions La1-x(Ca,Ce)xPO4 and Gd1-x(Sr,Ce)xPO4, respectively. These had been precipitated and dried at 50 °C before measurement. Room temperature XANES measurements of the powders were performed before pellet pressing to exclude any effect of the pressing on the oxidation state. Afterwards, pellets of all compositions were pressed, glued to an oven and heated with controlled heating rates. These were varied between 15 °C/min for measurements with a maximum temperature of 800 °C and 1.5 °C/min for measurements with a maximum temperature of 500 °C.</p><p>Long holding times at high and low temperatures were allowed in some experiment to study the behaviour of the samples at constant temperatures.</p><p>While quantification is still in progress, qualitatively the same behaviour has been observed in all samples.</p><p>Starting from surprisingly Ce(III)-rich precipitates the remaining tetravalent Cerium is reduced rapidly upon heating. As soon as temperatures are decreased again Cerium is oxidized to a degree similar to the Ce(III)/Ce(IV)-ratio observed before the experiment. This behaviour is visualized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>  Overall, the experiments were very successful. This heating setup was used for the first time in combination with the XAS equipment and allowed very good temperature control. It was possible to induce and record changes in the oxidation state of Cerium. The high reproducibility of the observed behaviour is a strong indication that the method works reliably.</p><p>[1] Mesbah, A., Clavier, N., <ref type="bibr">Elkaim, E., Szenknect, S., &amp; Dacheux, N.

Based on experiments with low heating rates the onset temperature for the Cerium reduction could be determined between 100 °C and 150 °C. According to Mesbah et al. between room temperature and 150 °C rhabdophane is dehydrated from LnPO4*0.667 H2O to LnPO4*0.5 H2O (both monoclinic, C2). The remaining water is eliminated below 250 °C leading to a hexagonal anhydrous rhabdophane phase [1]. The dehydration and phase change are reversible [2]. The phase transformation from rhabdophane to monazite between 600 °C and 700 °C [3], however, is irreversible. Powder XRD measurements of the pulverized pellets after the end of the experiments confirm that the phase transition occurred even during short experiments. The driving forces behind the recuction and oxidation of Cerium during heating and cooling have not been established yet.</figDesc></figure>
