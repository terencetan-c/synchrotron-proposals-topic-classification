<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Proposal Summary: Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF), carried out by the endosymbiotic interaction legumes-rhizobia, is a sustainable source of nitrogen in natural ecosystems and agriculture. For this, transport of iron-species from the host plant to different tissues in the root nodules, where the symbiosis occurs, is fundamental. In this project, we proposed to use µXRF and µXANES to determine Fe distribution and speciation in the context of SNF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Iron distribution and speciation in Medicago truncatula-Sinorhizobium meliloti nodule sections: Previously, we had determined by µXRF that Fe is delivered by the vasculature to a specific zone of model legume Medicago nodules. These previous data was obtained from chemically fixed samples (which can suffer artifacts by metal remobilization). Here we used flash-frozen samples, sectioned and analyzed under cryo conditions. Wild type (WT) nodules showed an accumulation of iron in the apical part of the nodule, where the element is present as dots in the apoplast. Then, along the zones of the nodule, we observed an incorporation of iron within the cells, and finally an accumulation of iron in the infected cells, which showed a ring-like distribution typical of symbiosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Within nodules, a complex speciation of iron is expected, due to the presence of several iron-chelating molecules (citrate and nicotianamine), and large ammounts of ferroproteins, namely cytochromes (containing ionic Fe as cofactor), leghemoglobin (containing heme), and nitrogenase (containing Fe as Fe 4 S 4 clusters, Fe 8 S 7 P-clusters and FeMoco cofactor). µXANES data showed that in the vessels, Fe is mainly bound to organic acids as Fe 3+ , or in a form with common aspects with Fe 2+ -S and Fe 2+ -N. In the infection zone (ZII), Fe is mainly associated as Fe 3+ to organic acids (citrate), and a small proportion coordinated as Fe 2+ by sulfur (most likely glutathione). In the interzone and the fixing zone, most of the Fe is present as Fe 2+ , either associated to nitrogen (heme from leghemoglobin or cytochromes), or bound to sulfur (expectedly to Fe-S clusters such as those in nitrogenase) (Fig1D).</p><p>Mutants in iron-chelating molecules alter iron distribution and speciation in nodules: In Medicago there are two main iron chelators: citric acid and nicotianamine. These Fe-binding molecules have an important role in SNF in nodules, since altering their levels in nodules negatively affects symbiosis. However very little information is available of their role and precise. For this we used mutants in a nodule-specific citrate exporter (mate4-1) and a nodule-induced NA synthase (nas1-1). mate4-1 showed an altered distribution of iron when comparted with WT nodules. Specifically iron is detected in the apoplast, as a dotted pattern similar to that observed in infection zone (ZII) of WT nodules. Furthermore there is a decrease in the incorporation of iron within infected cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). In nas1-1 nodules iron distribution pattern is similar to WT nodules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), with three distinguisable zones, but the intensity is half of that observed in WT nodules (data not shown). Interestingly, speciation inferred from μXANES from mate4-1 and nas1-1 mutant nodules are similar, and different from that of WT nodules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). It remains to be determined the reason of this, since citrate and nicotianamine cannot work in the same environment Cryo-setup is required for in situ iron speciation analysis: Cryo-techniques are particularly important when analysing metals. Due to their small size and their solubility in water, they are easily mobilized between tissues or subcellular compartments. As a methodology test, we analyzed a same section both in cryohidrated conditions, and after recovery in liquidN 2 followed by liophilization. Iron distribution at tissue level was similar than in fully hidrated samples, even after the distorsion in cellular structure observe in freeze-dried samples. In contrast, spectra acquired using pinhole-XANES in both fully-hidrated and liophilized nodule sections, showed that in freeze-dried samples all iron correspond to Fe 3+ . ID26 Nanobeam allows the detection of metals within bacteroids: As a feasibility test, we used freezedried sections at ID16B with the objective of analyze subcellular iron distribution within infected (IC) and non-infected cells (UC). Sections were analyzed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), showing the existence of some artifacts as the presence of some cavities. However, there is a electrodense network that correspond with symbiosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). XRF maps showed an enrichment of S, Cl, and K in vesicles of UC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Metals (Zn, Cu and Fe) were almost absent in UC, but highly accumulated in IC. Specifically, Fe, Cu and Zn are present in the network-like structure corresponding with symbiosomes. Although preliminary, these results suggest an enrichment of metals in symbiosomes, but to advance in that direction we should wait until cryosetup is developed in ID16B line.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and perspectives:</head><p>According to the data obtained in EV-246 experiment, iron shows drastic changes in distribution and oxidation state along the nodule, fitting with the biological processes which are occurring along the nodule. Citrate maintains apoplastic iron in a soluble form because mutants affected in citrate extrussion (mate4-1) showed an accumulation of apoplastic iron in a dotted pattern. Surprisingly, mutation of a nicotianamine synthase (nas1-1) resulted in a similar localization as in the mate4-1 plants, However, nicotianamine cannot work in the same enviroment as citrate. As a tentative model, we propose that nicotianamine is forming a cytosolic iron-pool available for metallation of cytosolic proteins, but this hypothesis would require further experiments. Preliminary data at ID16B showed an enrichement of iron specifically within bacteroids, so our future work will be to identify the plant transporters responsibles of metal delivery to symbiosomes and bacteria transporters responsible of uptake from symbiosome space. Overall, these results imply that any biotechnological approach to develop N 2 -fixing plants requires a parallel development of an iron delivery pathway.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Iron distribution and speciation in Medicago nodules.
