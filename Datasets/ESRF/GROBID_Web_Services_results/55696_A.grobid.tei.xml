<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The yielding of glasses is important for a wide range of materials including metallic glasses, polymer-and soft glasses. Yielding demarcates the property of any solid to flow and deform irreversibly under applied deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. At small applied stress and strain, the material deforms mostly elastically; at larger strain, the material starts to flow irreversibly, resulting in permanent deformation. We use a novel experimental setup with vertical x-ray beam which combines x-ray scattering technique and rheology to perform the oscillatory shear of a colloidal glass and monitor the structure factor evolution during the increasing strain amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>The installation of new experimental setup with vertical x-ray beam took longer time than we expected and 1.5 days of measurements were spent for the calibration and beam alignment. Due to the reflection procedure to redirect the beam in the vertical position the intensity of the scattered beam was much lower than expected. Still part of the intended research was successfully carried out, where we have probed the samples response at different oscillation frequencies.</p><p>The experimental sample is a suspension consisting of silica particles with a diameter of 50 nm and a polydispersity of 10%, suspended in water. A small amount (1mM) of NaCl is added to screen the particle charges. The samples were prepared close to the glassy state with volume fractions 54-62%. We have used the rheometer to apply oscillatory strain with frequencies f=0.5-5 Hz and strain amplitude γ 0 increasing from γ 0min =10 -4 to γ 0max =1. We measure rheological macroscopic parameters (viscosity, storage and loss moduli) to track the sample transition from elastic state (low amplitudes) to plastic deformation (high amplitudes). We simultaneously monitor the scattered intensity at a frame rate of 1 Hz. From the recorded intensity, we determine the structure factor S(q) and focus on the first peak of the structure factor to elucidate changes in the nearest-neighbor structure upon yielding (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, left). By tracking the distribution of intensity along first scattering ring with respect to angle α we detect a weak two-fold symmetry imposed the applied shear (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, right). However this anisotropic symmetry only exist at low strain amplitudes; for amplitudes higher than a certain threshold γ 0 * the anisotropy vanishes signifying the transition of the sample into dynamically melted isotropic liquid state. By using specific techniques we can correlate the intensity along the angle α to remove the influence of the fluctuation (C(β)=&lt;S 1 (α+β)S 1 (α)&gt; α ). Alternatively we can study the fluctuation themselves by calculating the Kurtosis along the ring. Amazingly both quantities show sharp changes at amplitude γ 0 *</p><p>, corresponding the glass transition from solid to liquid state (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>During the experiments we have concentrated on the transition point γ 0 * behavior with respect to the driving frequency and volume fraction. We have found that γ 0 * weakly decreases with volume fraction in glassy state (φ&gt;58%). From the other hand in the tested range of driving frequencies 0.5-5Hz the transition point slowly increases from ~10% to a maximum ~15%.</p><p>More interestingly we have confirmed that at transition point γ 0 * microscopic structure parameters always have a sharp change which coincides with the crossing point of G' and G'' (storage and loss moduli), which corresponds to sample transition from liquid the solid state on macroscopic level. Our measurements at ESRF have confirmed that this transition is reversibleby changing the direction of the oscillatory amplitude ramping from increasing to decreasing we can effectively start with dynamically liquidized glassy sample and turn it back to the solid state at γ 0 * . The transition point from solid to liquid and liquid to solid shows weak hysteresis behavior which we are going to explore in future works.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (Left) Scatter pattern of Silica colloidal glass.
