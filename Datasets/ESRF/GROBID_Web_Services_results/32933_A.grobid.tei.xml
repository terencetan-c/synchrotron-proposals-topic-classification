<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Proteins under investigation concern enzymes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis (1) in grape (Vitis vinifera), a plant model of particular interest, according to its high content in two different flavonoid subclasses : anthocyanins and condensed tannins. The former are mainly responsible for the wine colour attributes whereas the latter provide sensorial properties such as astringency or bitterness. Therefore, their relative content is a key parameter which affects both quality and wine behaviour during aging. Besides potential important economic applications in the winemaker's world, grape is considered as a perfect candidate to understand the biochemical mechanisms driving the flavonoid expression and levels during fruit development. The biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins and condensed tannins includes :</p></div>

Despite the fact that a number of DFR cDNAs have been isolated from various plants and that the corresponding proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified, no structural data were available up to now. In the course of our structural investigation of enzymes involved in the flavonoid pathway in Vitis vinifera, we succeeded in growing two different crystal forms of the native enzyme obtained by co-crystallisation with NADP + and dihydroquercetin.Several crystals of the first form (diamond shaped) were tested. All exhibited anisotropic diffraction, diffracted to a poor resolution limit and appeared to be twinned.Crystals of the second form (needles) diffractedup to 1.8 Å on BM30A and lead to the orthorhombic P2 1 2 1 2 1 space group (a = 87.4 Å, b = 89.62 Å, c = 92.81 Å) with 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. To solve the structure, five MAD data sets were recorded at respectively E= 12642, 12640 and 12740 eV for crystals of the corresponding Se-met substituted protein. One of these allowed us to find the positions of the 26 Se atoms of the dimer, using the SHELX program suite and to build a model starting from the obtained electron density map. Crystallographic data of the phasing data set:</figDesc></figure>
