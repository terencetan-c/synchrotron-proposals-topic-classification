<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Understanding the origin of CO oxidation activity at single 1. Abstract Ru(II) compounds are widely used in catalysis, photocatalysis and medical applications. They usually obtained in reductive environment as molecular O2 can oxidize Ru(II) to Ru(III) and Ru(IV). Here we have designed an air-stable surface -[bipy-Ru(II)(CO)2Cl2] site that is obtained by reduction of -[bipy-Ru(III)Cl4]-with simultaneous ligand exchange from Cl-to CO. The -[bipy-Ru(II)(CO)2Cl2] site enables oxidation of CO with a turnover frequency of 0.73  10 -2 s -1 at 462 K, while the Ru(III) site is completely inert.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiment details</head><p>Fresh sample, sample after step 1, 2 and 3 treatment are first being meaured ex-situ, together with RuCl3, RuO2 and NaCl as standards. Furthermore, fresh sample is measured in-situ. 1% CO and 1% O2 was introduced into the chamber, then the sample was heat up from room temperature to 200 °C . Ru L3 edge and Cl K edge XAFS were measured during heat up. Then after cooling down in the same gas condition, 1% H2 was further intrroduced into the chamber, the sample was then het up to 300 °C , Ru L3 edge and Cl K edge XAFS were measured during heat up. After cooling down to room tempertuare, the gas condition changes to 1% CO and 1% O2 again then heat up to 300 °C . Ru L3 edge and Cl K edge XAFS were measured during heat up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>The HERDF-XANES measurment use the Ru 3d to 2p emission as the fluoresence detection, which significantly increases the energy resolution. In this study we have three spin states: t2g 4 eg 0 , t2g 5 eg 0 , and t2g 6 eg 0 . The RuO2 has a double features that are corresponded to 2p3/2 →4dt2g and 2p3/2 → 4deg excitation with a t2g 4 eg 0 configuration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a blue</ref>). RuCl3 has a t2g 5 eg 0 configuration. Due to the distortion in the lattice, the further split of the eg level leads to a broad feature that is difficult to fit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>, <ref type="figure">red</ref>). This is in good agreement with the literatue report. 1 Our fresh sample -[Ru(bipy)Cl4]H has the t2g 5 eg 0 without any distrotion from the crystal. Therefore, the 2p3/2 →4dt2g and 2p3/2 → 4deg excitations are clearly visible (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a black</ref>).</p><p>With only one hole at t2g 5 , the 2p3/2 →4dt2g has much lower probability than 2p3/2 → 4deg. The first activation step should form -[Ru(bipy)COCl3] species, which keeps Ru at 3+ with Cl -replaced by CO. The Ru 2p to CO * transition is clearly visible at 2842 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> green) is higher that than that of 2p3/2 → 4deg transition, which helps to confirm the relative orbital energy in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Interestingly, the 2p3/2 → 4dt2g has also decreased significantly, suggesting completely occupied t2g orbitals. This may due to the strong  bonding from the CO 2 to 4dxy orbital. Moving to step 2, in which H2 is used to reduce Ru 3+ to Ru 2+ . The Ru 2p to CO * transition decreases in intensity even with 2 CO ligands coordinate with the Ru 2+ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).   Moreover, the process showed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> was further investigate via in-situ measurement together with Cl K edge measurement. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> shows the reduction of Ru starts from 373K and at 473K, the feature at 2837.7 eV disappears completely with the formation Ru 2p to CO * transition at 448 K, suggesting a simultaneous Ru 3+ reduction and CO insertion. This is beyond our current knowledge as we thought step 1 is a simply ligand exchange reaction. The corresponded Cl K edge spectra showed a decrease in the Cl 1s to Ru 4d t2g transition, further confirms that CO will reduce the Ru 3+ in the step 1. In step 2, H2 is introduced with another CO coordination to Ru. This leads to a slight blue shift of the Ru 2p to CO * transition with decreased intensity. It is not clear why the probability of such transition has been decreased slightly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>). The Cl K edge spectra show mainly the Cl 1s to Ru eg transition.</p><p>Step 3 is the real CO oxidation environment, so both Ru and Cl do not change during the reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion, conclusions and furture work</head><p>The reduction of Ru(III) and the formation of cis(CO)-trans(Cl)-[Ru(bipy)(CO)2Cl2] sites has been confirmed by both Ru L3 edge and Cl K edge measurement. In the step 1, the ligand exchange and Ru 3+ reduction take place at 448 K. In step 2, the further ligand exchange with the formation of HCl happens at 548 K. However, it is not clear why the Ru 2p to CO * transition has a blue shift when the second CO molecule is coordinated with Ru 2+ . It is also not clear what is the oxidative product for the step 1 as we do not see any CO2 formation. Both require further investigation. We still have the Ru core to core RIXS data that can be analyzed and reported in the future. Further explanation of the spectra requires careful calculations, which is sought in collaborations.</p></div>
