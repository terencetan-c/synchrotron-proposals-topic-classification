<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Promising materials for new generations of light emitters or solar cells are based on semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). The optical properties are highly linked to their size, crystallinity and location within a matrix. A successful method to get uniformly sized NCs is the use of multilayer (ML) structures <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. In a series of ongoing studies <ref type="bibr">(20-02-658, -667, -674)</ref>, during this ROBL experiment (Ge-SiO 2 / SiO 2 ) 50x ML are investigated. The simultaneous deposition of Ge+SiO 2 by reactive magnetron sputtering from Ge and Si targets in the dc mode uses a certain process window for the oxygen partial pressure <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Samples, prepared at FZD beforehand, differ with respect to deposition temperatures, ML period thicknesses and the Ge/SiO 2 ratios. The variation of the stoichiometry was quantified by Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) prior to the beam time.</p><p>At the ROBL beamline the samples were ex-situ stepwise annealed in a separate UHV oven (base pressure low 10 -8 mbar range) between 500 -800°C (T = 50K), in between characterized with xray ( = 1.24 Å) scattering and diffraction. In the following the results of one representative sample are presented: substrate Si(001), deposition temperature T = 425°C, ML period thickness 5.8 nm, and Ge to SiO 2 ratio 1:2. The SiO 2 separation layers thickness amounts to 1.0 nm.</p><p>As shown in fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, after deposition and annelings up to 600°C, only the broad Ge near-order peak at about 2 = 22° appears in the GiXRD pattern (Scherrer size ~ 1.5 nm). The crystallisation of Ge starts at 650°C indicated by Ge(111) peak narrowing and the appearance of the Ge(220) and Ge(311) reflections. For annealing temperatures &gt; 650°C, the peaks are characterized by the superposition of two contributions from Ge NCs of different sizes. Subsequent electron microscopy investigations reveal the existance of small Ge NCs in the ML (4 nm as visible in TEM fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and bigger NCs with sizes between 30 -150 nm at the surface (SEM in fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). After annealing at 800°C the crystallisation of Ge is completed as proofed by Raman spectroscopy.</p><p>In the XRR pattern (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), the partial coverage of surface with Ge NCs leads to a dip in the spectra at very low angles (grey rectangle). This can be interpreted as a second critical angle for SiO 2 which originates from the part of the surface not covered by Ge NCs. Furthermore, with increasing temperatures the 1 st order ML peak is shifted to a larger angel which indicates a slight decrease of the ML period thickness due to ongoing Ge redistribution from the ML towards the surface.</p><p>The TEM picture in fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> reveals that the ML structure is still visible for the first layers, but with increasing distance to the Si substrate it seems to be washed out. In contrast XRR shows still a multilayer peak for the annealed samples so that there must be a density variation with a fixed length, which maybe ca nnot resolved in TEM. In the inset in fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>  From the data evaluation of the complete sample set the following conclusions can be derived:</p><p>(1) the Ge crystallization temperature in (Ge+SiO 2 )/SiO 2 ML is considerably (~ 150°C) higher than in GeOx/SiO 2 ML, where Ge NCs are formed already at 550°C, (2) the Ge NC size (2-10 nm) can be well tailored by the Ge containing ML sub-layer thickness and temperature, (3) the formation of a high density of larger Ge NCs (30 -100 nm) at the surface becomes more pronounced with increasing Ge to SiO 2 ratio and decreasing deposition temperature.</p></div>
