<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>With this proposal, we wanted to investigate how a dynamic gas feed during the reaction 4H2 + CO2 ↔ CH4 + 2H2O influences the structure of a Ni3Fe catalyst. For this purpose we performed 3 experiments with changing gas feed, namely: Full hydrogen dropouts (activation of the catalyst in 100% H2, followed by 30 min catalysis with 8 mL/min H2 and 2 mL/min CO2 followed by 30 min dropout with 0 mL/min H2, 2mL/min CO2, 8 mL/min He, overall 7 cycles), partial dropouts (activation, 30 min catalysis followed by 30 min dropout with 4 mL/min H2, 2 mL/min CO2, 4 mL/min He, overall 7 cycles), stochiometric dropouts (activation, 30 min catalysis followed by 30 min dropout with 4 mL/min H2, 1 mL/min CO2, 5 mL/min He, overall 7 cycles).</p><p>We collected the data using a Dectris Pilatus 3 CdTe 2M with an X-ray energy of 65 keV, which led to a Qrange of 0.7-30.8 Å -1 . We knew from earlier beamtimes with this detector, that strong scattering samples can produce a memory/ghosting effect. Therefore, we reduced the measuring time to 1 s, followed by 30 s sleep.</p><p>The full dropouts revealed an interesting phase behavior of the Ni3Fe alloy catalyst. At room temperature, the sample consisted of mostly NixFey alloy fcc structure, with sidephases of the corresponding oxides. This was expected, as the samples were stored under air. During the experiments the ratios of the sidephases changed (see Figure1).</p><p>The conversion of CO2 to CH4 decreased with time on stream, visible in the decreasing MS signal of CH4.</p><p>The experiments with partial and stochiometric dropouts of H2 showed a less harsh response in the phase transition and the CO2 conversion. We think that these results are of great value, especially for the catalysis community, that is trending towards catalysts that are comprised of more than one metal.</p><p>To study the structural behavior right after the gas feed change with a higher time resolution, we conducted a 4 th experiment under full H2 dropout conditions, where we reduced the frames per image to 100 ms, with a total 600 frames after the gas feed change. This resulted in several ten thousand datasets, which are still under investigation. The above experimental results will be connected to complementary XAS and XES data measured at DESY Petra III beamline P65 and P64, and the goal is to submit a publication during the second funding phase of the DFG priority program SPP2080.</p><p>Another experiment that we conducted was the tracking of structural deviations inside the catalyst bed, by applying a horizontal scan along the catalyst bed. We took 1 s measurements at 11 points with 1 mm distance and a 150x150 micron beam size. This data is still under study.</p><p>A reference catalyst consisting of NiO on an Al2O3 support synthesized by an urea precipitation method was also measured. We applied the same gas feed conditions as for the full H2 dropouts described above. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Received at ESRF:Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
