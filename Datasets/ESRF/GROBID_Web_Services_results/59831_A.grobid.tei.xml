<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Formation and stability of U(V) during biological and abiotic reduction of uranium</p><p>Experiment number: EV-192 Beamline: ID26 Date of experiment: from: 20/04/2016 to: 25/04/2016 Date of report: 06/01/2017 Shifts:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>During the beamtime we analysed the HERFD-XANES of the U M 4 -edge and the Fe K-edge (where applicable) of 5 sets of samples:</p><p>1. U(IV) and U(VI) standards Several samples intended as redox reference standards were analysed for their U M 4 -edge XANES. These samples included minerals from the University of Manchester museum collection (e.g. uranophane (U(VI)) and uraninite (U(IV))), experimental uranium precipitates (e.g. uranium adsorbed to ferrihydrite, clarkeite (NaU(VI)O 2 O(OH):H 2 O) and ninyoite CaU(IV)(PO 4 )H 2 O).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Microbial reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) (Downie et al.)</head><p>Experiments targetting microbial reduction of uranium were performed to explore the suitability of HERFD-XANES for analysis of U oxidation state in biological materials. A timeseries of samples indicated mixed oxidation states for U over the experiment and we are considering further experiments to define the mechanisms of reduction in these biological systems.</p><p>3. Redox speciation of U coprecipitated with magnetite (Roberts et al.) Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) was crystallized in the presence of U(VI) using a direct precipitation method.</p><p>4. Oxidation state of uranium in organic rich sediments (Fuller et al.) Sediment samples were collected from an area with naturally occuring uranium. Samples analysed at ESRF were all from the same sample core and at different depths <ref type="bibr">(10, 20, 25, 30 and 35 cm)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">U speciation following the microbial breakdown of isosaccharinic acid (Kuippers et al.)</head><p>For this purpose this study microbial enrichment cultures were investigated, these microbial communities were grown on ISA as the sole carbon source which was complexed to uranium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>1. A range of standards were measured, U(VI) standards do show different HERDF-XANES spectra, likely due to differences in the local coordination environment. Furthermore all U(IV) data from samples we measured seemed to show mixed uranium oxidation states. Future work will aim to determine if these are inherently mixed oxidation phases or oxidation occurred during analyses or sample preparation.</p><p>2. For pure culture bioreduction iterative target transformation factor analysis (ITTFA) using U(IV) and a U(VI) standards as end members was performed (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). These data suggested the presence of U(V) in these samples and these high quality U(VI), U(V) and U(IV) data are now informing further experiments.</p><p>3. HERDF-XANES analyses in the magnetite experiments confirmed U(V) was abundant in magnetite samples. Furthermore, we have found that HERDF-XANES analyses were essential in informing the interpretation and fitting procedure of our EXAFS analyses for these samples.</p><p>4. The HERDF-XANES analyses confirm that uranium is present principally as U(VI) with some reduction to U(IV) at 30cm. The HERDF-XANES results have informed EXAFS fits on paralel samples which confirm the adsorbed nature of U(VI) in these samples.</p><p>5. The HERFD-XANES analyses showed that uranium was removed from solution either as U(IV) or U(VI) dependent on the microbial community. These data have already informed complementary EXAFS data analyses and further experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We successfully confirmed the presence of U(V) in two of the experimental sample sets and the HERFD-XANES data has been instrumental in informing fitting procedures of complementary EXAFS data and in the design of further experiments. U(V) appears to be a significant intermediate oxidation state during the microbial reduction of U(VI) to U(IV). And U(V) appeared stabilized when present during the crystallization of magnetite.
