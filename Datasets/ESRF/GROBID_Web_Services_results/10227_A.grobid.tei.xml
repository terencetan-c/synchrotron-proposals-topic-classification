<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment is designed to gain information on the Fe and Cu decoration of the quasiperiodic lattice in icosahedral Al&amp;Fe. The method is anomalous diffraction on the Kedges of both Fe and Cu, and the results are to be compared to 57Fe nuclear resonant diffraction experiments on the same single grain crystal. In the time allotted, it was possible to measure at three different gamma energies, just at the Cu K-edge (8.979 keV) at 8.974 keV, and at the Fe edge (7.112 keV), at 7.107 and 7.027 keV. A series of 10 1 different reflections have been studied. The measured Bragg intensities have been corrected for polarisation effects, for changes in scattering volume, as well as for temperature effects. Lorentz corrections have also been made. The diagram below shows the corrected line intensities as a function of the "parallel-space" scattering vector Qparallel, as well as the "perpendicular space" scattering vector Qperp. We see very large effects of anomalous scattering: on almost all the reflections with Qperp. &lt; 0.1 A-', the scattered intensity before the Fe-edge (7.027 keV) is much stronger than at the edge (7.107). This effect is due to the changing contrast between Fe and Cu for these reflections. These results (which must first be completed with another run just below the Cu K-edge) will now be used to study the different models proposed for the Fe and Cu decoration on Al&amp;Fe quasicrystals. These include both the perfect quasicrystalline crystal model of Katz and Gratias, as well as the random tiling model. For this, we are working both with the group of denis Gratias (Paris) as well as the group of P. Kramer, Tiibingen.</p></div>		</body>
