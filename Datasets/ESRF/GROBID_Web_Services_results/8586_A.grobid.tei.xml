<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>KCN is a simple molecular crystal with a pseudocubic sodium chloride structure at room temperature. It undergoes two phase transitions associated with the CN-electric dipole moment and the elastic quadrupole moment along the following temperature scheme: T = 3OOh' pseudocubic, orientationally disordered (plastic) + ?',I = 168K electrically disordered (ferroelastic) + T'2 = 83K electrically ordered (antiferroelectric). The rotational excitations of the CN-dumbbells overlap energetically with the ordinary "translational modes". Therefore, the rotational, librational and tunneling transitions cause an increased inelastic diffuse background in scattering experiments that diverges logarithmically when the upper phase transition is approached <ref type="bibr">([l] H. J ex et al. Solid State Commun. 36(1980)713;</ref><ref type="bibr">F. Wittmann and H. Jex Solid State Commun. 53(1984)</ref>407). At Z',i the elastic constant which is involved in the shear modes approaches zero C44 + 0. In our experiment at the nuclear beamline ID 18 we analysed the spectral distribution of that inelastic part in the neV to peV-energy range by means of a nuclear resonant monochromator/absorber combination of two FeB0s crystals via the 14.41ceV resonance line of 57Fe. The first crystal -acting as a nuclear monochromator -was adjusted in the nuclear (333) Bragg reflection and the second one -used in transmission as a resonance absorber -was mounted in a high velocity transducer (u,,, = 1OOOy) for Doppler shifts up to 48peV. The synchrotron ran in the 16 bunch mode. We selected delayed photons from a time window between 9n.s to 180ns into energy spectra. The nuclear hyperfine splitting and quantum beating of In our first experiment we measured the spectral resolution function of our two crystal monochromatar/absorber system at two Doppler velocities w,,, = 400 (and SOO)? of a sinusoidal motion. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> presents the observed spectrum for the first velocity after folding of the collected data and after correction for the sinusoidal motion. We observe 4 lines with a maximum splitting of 42.5 (and 22) channels.</p><p>In the next experiments we adjusted the KCN crystal between monochromator and analyser in different Bragg scattering positions. We probed the ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">400</ref>) and (600) reflections of KCN and found an effectively scattering domain with a halfwidth of 95arcsec and high scattering power in the (400) Bragg reflection. The crystal was mounted in a cryostat and temperature runs at T = 293K and 180K were taken with 4OOy Doppler velocity and at T = 293K and 170K with SOOY Doppler velocity. The data collected at 180K with the Doppler velocity of 4OOy are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We recognize the same 4 line structure after Bragg scattering from KCN. An unexpected feature of the spectra are the increased intensities in the wings of the four lines which are present in the gauge experiment and the KCN scattering as well. The spectral range outside the four lines from f400neV 3 dE + f19.2peV does not exhibit a significant peak structure. However, when the region around the four lines (inside the arrows of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>) is integrated with the outer part as a reference (quasi background) line we find the following trend: in the gauge experiment the negative part below the reference dominates, while the positive contributions becomes increasingly dominant, when the phase transition at ?",I is approached. This holds for both Doppler velocities. We conclude that the large Debye-Waller factor of KCN reduces the coherent elastic scattering, as temperature goes down! It may also indicate that the thermal diffuse inelastic scattering is concentrated in the sub-400neV energy range that could not be resolved in our experiment. We thank the ESRF staff for their support and hospitality.
