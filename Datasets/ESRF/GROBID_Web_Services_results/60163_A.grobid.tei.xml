<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This beam time was our first beam time in the ESRF. We had two different goals at this beam time:</p><p>(1) Testing and commissioning of gas dosing manifold and in-situ sample cells:</p><p>The main purpose of this beam time was to test and commission our gas dosing manifold and in-situ single crystal and powder cell that has been used and will be used normally in our in-situ diffraction experiments in ESRF.</p><p>We had designed our gas dosing manifold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), the in-situ powder cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and the in-situ single crystal cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The picture of the sample cell on the beam (in BM01) has been shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The gas dosing manifold in addition to the both sample cells were tested on the beam in BM01 and their reliability were confirmed by conduction of the preliminary experiments. In addition, as many MOFs are not highly stable, the beam sensitivity of some of the samples were checked in advance in order to design the next in-situ experiments.</p><p>For example, for some of ZIF samples, we found that when they are located at 100 ºC while the diffraction pattern was continuously being measured, they are going under partial beam damage and therefore the reduction of the crystallinity. Therefore enough thought and care had to be taken in this kind of in-situ activation measurements. As a result, the next experiments that were done in BM01, BM02, and BM31 were designed in Figure 2-Designed in-situ powder cell such a way that exposure to beam becomes minimal. For some other samples like Cu-BTTri, the beam damage was not considerable. (2) Collection of ex-situ diffraction pattern for single crystal and powder samples: The ex-situ powder and single crystal diffraction pattern was measured on some samples where high quality data was needed for certain purposes or collection of the pattern in standard lab based instrument was not possible due to the small size of the sample or lack of high enough quality of the crystal. Having these data, already one paper has been published 1 . The full reference detail has come in the footnote. In the mentioned work, the crystal structures with the CCDC deposition number of 1539823 and 1539825 have been measured in BM01, SNBL ESRF. The abstract of the above published work has come as following: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention in the past decade owing to their unprecedented internal surface areas, tunable topologies, designable surfaces, and various potential applications. One bottleneck in the field regarding MOF synthesis is controlling the metal-containing secondary building unit (SBU) incorporated into the structure. In this work we report the synthesis and characterization of five trimeric [M3(μ3-O)(CH3CO2)6]x clusters (where M = Fe 3+ , Cr 3+ , Fe 3+ /Cr 3+ , Fe 3+ /Co 2+ , or Fe 3+ /Ni 2+ and x = +1 or 0). The monocarboxylate capping ligand, acetate in this case, readily undergoes exchange with several difunctional counterparts, including 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2-BDC) and biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2-BPDC), for the formation of an isostructural series of MOFs,several of which are newly reported (for M = Fe 3+ /Cr 3+ , Fe 3+ /Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ /Ni 2+ ) and show excellent CO2 adsorption properties. In this report, a host of techniques including NMR, ICP, and ESI-MS are used to probe the ligand exchange process and composition of the SBUs, and XAS is used to monitor the Fe 3+ and Cr 3+ environment throughout the reactions, giving strong evidence that the clusters stay intact throughout the MOF synthesis. This work reveals that predefined SBUs is an effective means to create metal-substituted analogues of known frameworks. Further, CO adsorption and in situ IR are used to probe accessibility of the metals after solvent removal. We show for the first time that the incorporation of the neutral clusters, containing weaker Lewis acids like Ni 2+ and Co 2+ , can promote the formation of open metal sites in the MOF frameworks, structural features known to enhance the binding energy of small guest molecules like CO2. 1 Peng, Li, et al.
