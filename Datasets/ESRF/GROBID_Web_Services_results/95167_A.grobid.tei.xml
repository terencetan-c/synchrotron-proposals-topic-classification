Polymer Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands.</p><p>Were you able to execute the planned experiments? YES. We were able to perform the planned experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Did you encounter experimental problems?</head><p>NO. The setup and the beamline instrumentation had no problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Was the local support adequate?</head><p>YES. The support of the local contact, M. Rosenthal and of the technical staff, was adequate and allowed us to efficiently run the experiments. Therefore, we lost minimal time in installing our equipment in the beamline.</p><p>4. Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned in the project proposal? YES. All the experimental data collected at BM26-B allowed us to study the effect of extension rate on the extensional-flow induced crystallization kinetics of LDPE, to determine the growth rate of the kebabs and to analyze the formation of twisted lamella in extensional flow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>We performed experiments with a home-built filament stretching rheometer. This allowed us to heat a small fibril of LDPE to 150¬∞C to erase all thermal history, and to subsequently cool it down to the crystallization temperature of 107¬∞C, to apply a stretch with a Hencky strain between 0 and 3.2 (at strain rates between 0.1/s and 1.1/s), and meanwhile follow the crystallization, both during as well as after the stretching. Experiments were performed with the SAXS/1D-WAXS detector, as well as with the 2D-WAXS detector. Meanwhile, the rheological response was recorded with the rheometer. Apart from the initially planned experiments on LDPE, we also performed a feasibility check on measuring the crystallization in fiber-filled iPP across the complete fiber.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results on LDPE</head><p>The analysis of the SAXS signals (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> . By fitting the model on the SAXS patterns, we could extract the long period, the kebab diameter and the kebab thickness together with their size distribution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). By doing this for the different frames taken as a function of time, the kebab growth with time could be calculated for a set of strains and strain rates (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).  Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Results of the modelling of the SAXS data for a range of strains and strain rates, showing the kebab growth rates.</p><p>On the other hand, the 2D WAXS detector allowed us to follow the crystallinity evolution in time and the transformation of the (110) reflection from a 2-arc into a 4-arc off-axis reflection, due to lamella twisting in kebabs. Up to now, this phenomenon was mainly studied in shear flow. Our results show that the formation of twisted lamella in extension occurs already at rather low strain rates, but requires a minimum strain slightly above 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof-of-concept tests on iPP containing a single fiber</head><p>We also performed a feasibility check on a new type of experiment with our filament stretching rheometer. This experiment was aimed at studying the effect of fibers on the extensional-flow induced crystallisation of iPP. A set of three experiments was performed on three samples namely pure iPP, iPP with the compatibilizer MAH-g-PP and iPP with a single glass fiber. After the crystallization, we scanned the complete fiber to assess the distribution of crystallinity across the fiber. The results on iPP and iPP with MAH-g-PP demonstrated the strong effect of MAH-g-PP on the crystallization kinetics of iPP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Interestingly, the scanning of the fiber demonstrated a significant shift from ùõº-crystals to ùõΩ-iPP crystals in particular in the neighbourhood of the fiber (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). We hypothesize that this is caused by the development of strong shear in the neighbourhood of the fiber. However, one experiment is not sufficient to unambiguously draw this conclusion. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>) as a function of time allowed us to extract the kebab's radial growth rate as a function of time for different values of the Hencky strain and strain rate. Thereto, we used a literature model (Keum et al. Progress Colloids Polymer Science 2005 page 114)</figDesc></figure>
