<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have been investigating films formed from cat-anionic surfactant mixtures of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (C16TAB) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) since these form with a wider range of polymers including biocompatible polyacrylamide (PAAm) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . This led to the investigation of biomedical applications for these films. We have found that the mesostructure of CTAB-SDS-polymer films is highly dependent on the interactions between polymer and surfactant and we have also found that it is possible to induce phase changes in the film by varying the C16TAB to SDS ratio and the structural nature of the polymer 2 . Since we have extensively studied the formation and structure of surfactant-polymer films we now have begun to investigate introducing function to the films by incorporating functional species into the polymers. Phenylboronic acids are of interest as they reversibly bind polyols such as glucose 3 . These were successfully templated in our catanionic templated C 16 TAB/SDS films and we have compared sugar binding of these films against cast polymer films. Membranes that exhibit such selectivity could be used as saccharide recognition sensors or stimuli responsive release mechanisms if used as an encapsulation medium for therapeutic agents. This experiment aimed to determine the effects of polymer structure, polymer charge, polymer glucose binding and cat-anionic surfactant ratios on the film structures. Recovered films physical response on exposure to glucose has been been performed and related to structure. Polyacrylamides containing phenylboronic acids (PAAM-PBA) with different phenylboronic acid monomer block lengths were used to form films to investigate the effect phenylboronic acid block length has on the formation and structure of the films. Films templated with CTAB and SDS at a total concentration of 0.05M in molar ratios of 7:3 and 9:1 to investigate the effect of the surfactant ratios on the film structure. Phenylboronic acid was incorporated in to polyacrylamide by co-polymerisation of methacrylamidophenylboronic acid and acrylamide (PAAM-PBA). Variation of the methacrylamdiophenylboronic acid block lengths within PAAM-PBA was achieved by synthesising PAAM-PBA via an aqeuous SDS micelle mediated polymerisation, performing the polymerisation at low pH to ensure partioning of methacrylamidophenylboronic acid to ensure partitioning of methacrylamidophenylboronic acid to the SDS micelles. Variation of the monomer to SDS micelle ratio in the polymerisation feed produced polymers of PBA block length of 1, 3, 6 and 9. All films were formed at pH 4, pH 7 and pH 10 to investigate the effect of the PBA charge state in PAAM-PBA on the structure of films. Films were also formed at two PAAM-PBA concentrations; 0.1% wt and 1%wt to determine the effect of polymer concentration on the structure of the films. PBA was present at 3% mole within PAAM-PBA for all polymers and selected films were also grown in the presence of 100mM glucose to investigate the effect of glucose binding. All film growth was monitored using an off-specular reflection technique developed in previous experiments on ID10B. When film structure had stopped changing specular reflectivity profiles were collected for each film. GISAXS patterns were also collected for each film at two incident angles; 0.045 and 0.32 degrees (Incident energy 22 keV) to probe true surface and internal mesostructure of the films. Selected GISAXS Qxy slices are presented below at Qxy=0, incident angle 0.32 degrees of films formed from CTAB and SDS in 7:3 molar ratio at 0.05M with PAAM-PBA at 0.1% are presented below. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig A -PAAM-PBA (PBA block length 1); when PBA is non-ionic films dominated by a single diffraction peak indicated d-spacing of 37Ã… whilst when PBA was charged as if in a glucose bound state a gyroid cubic phase was evident co-existent with the 37 diffraction peak. Fig B -PAAM-PBA (PBA block length 9); when PBA is non-ionic films exhibiting a primitive cubic phase were formed whilst when PBA was charged as if in a glucose bound state a gyroid cubic phase was evident. Fig C -Time dependent optical density response of the PAAM-PBA films with block length 1 (blue trace) and block length 9 (red trace) upon exposure to glucose. The large block PAAM-PBA films undergo a structural change from a primitive cubic phase to a gyroid cubic phase with a more optically dense phase during the transition where as the small block PAAM-PBA films undergo a structural change from a optically dense lamellar phase to a less optically dense gyroid cubic. These results and there relation to the structure of the films determined on the experiment will shortly be submitted for publication. 1. B.M.D. O'Driscoll, E.A. Nickels, K.J. Edler, Chem.
