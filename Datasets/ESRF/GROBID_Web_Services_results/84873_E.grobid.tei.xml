<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This up-date report corresponds to the fourth round of data collection at ID30B within the Mx1938 proposal. We brought 100 samples from the team grouped as CSIC-UGR and from the GBRC at Glasgow University. All the samples were tested and the main results summarized below. Crystals from CSIC-UGR (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>): i) Ancestral-cellulase. In collaboration with a group of the CIC nanoGune we have crystallize a reconstructed ancestral cellulase. The enzyme crystallized with two different chemical cocktails and in two different polymorhps, P 21 and P3 21 containing 6 and 2 monomers in the ASU respectively. Since the higher resolution data set was obtained in P 21, the 3D model has been determined from this data using MR. The PDB will be deposited shortly and the manuscript is in preparation. Future perspectives: Even though the enzyme was crystallized in the presence of CMC (carboxymethilcellulase), the substrate is not present in the structure. Further attempts to soak/co-crystallize arabinose will be done. ii) LysR-type transcriptional regulator (Admx) from rizobacterium plymuthica. Infections due to multidrugresistant bacteria represent a major global health challenge. To combat this problem, new antibiotics are urgently needed and some plant-associated bacteria are a promising source. Andrimid (adm) is broad spectrum antibiotic produces by rizobacterium. AdmX is a transcriptional activator of the adm gene cluster that produce andrimid. In collaboration with the EEZ (CSIC) we have crystallized the ligand-binding-region bound to IAA (3indolacetic acid) and tested in this experimental round but crystal diffracted poorly. Future perspectives: Crystal improvement/optimization is being carried out. iii) L-carbamoylase from Bacillus stearothermophillus (BsLCar). L-specific carbamoylases are biotechnological important enzymes allowing the use of the hydantoinase process for the production of different optically pure Lamino acids. Whereas we solved in the past the first structure of an L-carbamoylase (PDB 35NF), we continue trying to obtain a complex of L-carbamoylase with a ligand. Crystals obtained in the presence of L-Met have been tested during this round, but they diffracted poorly. Future perspectives: Crystal improvement/optimization is being carried out. iv) L-amidase from Pseudomonas (PseAmid). L-specific amidases are industrially attractive enzymes, due to its potential for the production of optically pure L-amino acids starting from racemic mixtures of amino acidamides, which are cheap precursors. We have cloned, expressed purified and crystallized the enzyme from</p></div>

We have solved the structure of the unliganded PSeAmid from a dataset collected previously at ID30B during this bag proposal (1.8 Å, P212121, R/Rfree of 18.5%/23.4% respectively). Substrate-soaked crystals of PseAmid diffracted poorly, so, new crystals are being produced.</p><p>Future perspectives: Crystal improvement/optimization is being carried out. v) Formamidase from Bacillus cereus (BceAmiF). During the review process of the corresponding manuscript, the reviewers asked for new experiments to try ascertaining the modification clearly shown in the catalytic cysteine of this enzyme (from structures at atomic resolution obtained previously from datasets collected at the ESRF). After extensive but unsuccessful efforts to try determining its nature, we decided to soak this enzyme with different modification-agents (urea, formamide, acrylamide, hydroxylamine,…), which could support our hypothesis on the modification of this enzyme. Datasets up to 1.3 Å have been collected, thus further improving our previous structures. MR of the different datasets is ongoing to ascertain whether new ligands are bound in the catalytic centre, and some extra soaked-crystals have to be measured. Future perpectives: Decision to be taken after solving the different datasets collected, but this project is getting to its end. vi) Choline sulfatase from Sinorhizobium meliloti (SmelCOSe). We have previously obtained the structures of the free and liganded forms of SmelCOSe (PDBs 6G5Z and 6G60). However, during preparation of the corresponding manuscript, the unliganded structure has been published. We are thus attempting to solve activesite mutants of the enzyme bound to different ligands, to try to ascertain the ligand binding mode of this promiscous enzyme. We have obtained different full data sets of a C54S mutant bound to a Hepes molecule (SP C121, 2.0 Å R/Rfree of 17.5%/21.8% respectively), which inhibits SmelCOSe activity. Refinement is ongoing. Future perspectives: New crystals are being produced for soaking experiments.

In this Beamtime, we improved the resolution of both targets to 2.34 Å and 2.07 Å respectively (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We also got a 2.35 Å dataset of TerS λ /ppi2 in this but we were not able to get the phases to solve the structure. We also obtained 5 crystals of ppi1 but the diffraction was around 7 Å. Future perpectives: Improve the crystal quality of ppi1 to get better diffraction and obtain Se-Meth labelled protein crystals of TerS/ppi2 to solve the phase problem and then solve the crystallographic structure of the complex.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure1.</head><figDesc>Figure1.
