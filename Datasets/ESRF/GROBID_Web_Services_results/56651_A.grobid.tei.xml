<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we wished to decipher the behavior of the recently synthesized compound Mg2C60 which we had in powder and in a single crystal form.</p><p>In powder we were interested in the question: How does the C60 polymer network break up in high temperatures? Does the C60 network depolymerize, or do the individual C60 buckyballs break up first? The answer to this question would be interesting given the unusual thermal stability of this compound compared to its cousin Li4C60, which decomposes in much lower temperatures via de-polymerization <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Upon decomposition, powder diffraction pattern (for both Li4C60 and Mg2C60) becomes undefined, diffraction peaks disappear, seems that the material becomes completely amorphous and thus structural information is not obtainable from x-ray diffraction. The powder carbon K edge XRS results from annealed samples are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We performed a thorough study on different thermally annealed samples and the changes in the spectral structure are remarkable. Preliminary analysis show that at T=700C the spectra resemble that of pure C60 powder while at room temperature the intensity profile, as expected, resembles a polymeric C60 network, when compared with existing literature <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The decomposition pathway is suggested to be a de-polymerization, but spectra of C K and Mg L edge highlight different features: the former displays polymer breakdown under 400C, the latter shows the same environment from RT up to 550C. These unique results, obtained thanks to the powerful IXS probe, may point in the direction of one poorly ordered phase relatively elusive to diffraction where inter-C60 bonding is broken and magnesium remains in intercalated form. Earlier measurements demonstrated that, at T~100 K, the Mg ions unfreeze from their lattice positions and the material becomes ionic conductor with a conductivity that increases with increasing temperature. Using the single crystal we were interested in the following question: How does the ionic conductivity (of Mg 2+ ions) take place? Which pathways do the Mg ions prefer? This challenging approach has been performed on a rare single crystal (size ~0.70* 0.50* 0.07 mm) which has been carefully aligned and oriented with q vector parallel to the (100) and to the (001) crystallographic directions. This has been achieved by modulating the energy of the incoming beam and placing suitable XRD reflections in backscattering position along the direction of the incoming beam. We measured successfully Mg L2,3 edge at RT and at 3K in the He cryostat. Due to the small size of the crystal the measurement were unfortunately time demanding, thus only 2 lattice directions were explored. Nevertheless four measurements were completed and the anisotropy between in-and out-of-plane directions probed. The understanding of these data requires the simulation of electronic properties which will be tackled, in the forthcoming period, with the state of the art multiple scattering available algorithms. In both parts of the experiment, data reliability was guaranteed with proper calibration and evaluation of beam damage after increasing exposure time, Compton profile was recorded in order to perform a suitable background reduction treatment.</p><p>[1] M.
