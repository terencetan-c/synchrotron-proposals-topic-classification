The samples were prepared by ball-milling the mixtures Na2B12H12 + MCl2 (M = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg) ; Na2B12H12 + CuCl in a Fritsch Pulverisette 7 planetary mill, under Argon atmosphere. After the ball-milling, all samples (except the milled NaB12H12 + CuCl) were dissolved with 1 mL of water and then dried at 130 °C with a heating plate for 12 hours.</p><p>The data used for crystal structure and refinements were collected at the Swiss Norwegian Beamlines between 298 K and 673 K. SR-XPD were recorded on Dectris Pilatus M2 detector at a wavelength of 0.7225, 0.7280 and 0.8187 Å calibrated with NIST SRM640c Si standard. The 2D images were integrated and treated with the program Bubble. For all measurements, the samples were sealed into borosilicate capillaries of diameter 0.5mm (under Argon atmosphere), which were spun during data acquisition, and the temperature was controlled with a hot air blower calibrated with silver thermal dilatation. The dynamical vacuum was used to eliminate the solvent molecules in the capillaries during the measurement. Crystal structures were solved ab-initio using the software FOX and refined with the Rietveld method using TOPAS.</p><p>Closo-borane anion B12H12 2-, was modelled as rigid body with ideal icosahedral shape and with corresponding B-H and B-B distances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ni 2+</head><p>The thermally induced phase evolution in the samples depends on the gas pressure in the container. It is schematically drawn in the  Co 2+ (Mn 2+ , Fe 2+ , Fe 3+ ) Cobalt, manganese and iron containing samples prepared with water assisted ball-milling behave similarly.</p><p>As the samples were annealed after ball-milling no phase containing six non-bonded water molecules was observed even if it was reported for cobalt <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The samples contain at RT already the phase with only six bonded water molecules m1-M(H2O)6B12H12 M=Co, Mn, Fe described for Co in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, structure type of Cd(H2O)6B12H12 <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. On further heating in dynamic vacuum it releases 2 water molecules at 140 C and the phase m-M(H2O)4B12H12 M=Co, Mn, Fe is obtained, in analogy to Ni-system. On heating in closed system the all four six-water molecules complexes decompose into hydrated metal chlorides and monoclinic m-Na2B12H12. In Fe 3+ system the iron is reduced during synthesis to Fe 2+ and hydrated iron chloride is present already in as prepared sample. Only anhydrous CoB12H12 was obtained by further heating in dynamic vacuum and stays stable down to RT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), while manganese and iron sample shows presence of several phases from which only one was characterized in the iron sample as m-Fe(H2O)2B12H12 with novel structure type.</p></div>

Hydrated ball milled samples contain the hydrated phase Ni(H2O)6B12H12 • 6H2O first reported in [1] with lower content of non-bonded water, and crystallizing in the cubic structure reported in [2]. Very rapidly by heating to 42 C the non-bonded water molecules are removed, and novel structure of triclinic tri-Ni(H2O)6B12H12 is obtained. By further heating in a closed system first the polymorphic transition to novel monoclinic m2-Ni(H2O)6B12H12 is observed and then the decomposition to NiCl2 • H2O and halogenated hexagonal h-Na2B12H12-xClx. When heated under dynamic vacuum two bonded water molecules are removed before the polymorphic transformation and novel phase, m-Ni(H2O)4B12H12, is obtained which by further heating releases remaining water molecules and forms anhydrous m-NiB12H12 stable on cooling to RT.</figDesc></figure>
