<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the initial plan of the experiment, we had proposed to measure the inelastic X-ray scattering from polymer glasses under pressure, in continuation of a previous work done on PMMA glass (see experimental report HS197). In this latter investigation, we had evidenced a crossover pressure around 1.6 kbar, at which both the collective dynamics and the nanoscopic structural features of PMMA glass showed a change of regime in their pressure dependences <ref type="bibr">(Phys. Rev. Lett., 80 (1998), 4205)</ref>. These results were in agreement with the concept of non-inhomogeneity of the nanostructure of glasses (see for example Phys. Rev. B, 58 (1998) 8159), which actually motivated our first investigations on amorphous polymers.</p><p>In order to further test the relevancy of such concept, we attemped to measure the IXS of PMMA plasticized with dibutylphthalate (=DBP). Indeed, combined studies using Raman scattering and small angle X-ray scattering (Europhys. Lett. 44(1998) 747) had revealed that plasticizing PMMA with DBP molecules created a nanoscale heterogeneity while in the same time, increasing the boson peak intensity. Besides, S(Q) measurements of this system under pressure showed that the nanoheterogeneity of plasticized PMMA was significantly reduced increasing pressure. On the grounds of these observations, we considered that the investigation of the collective dynamics of this system under pressure would be very meaningful in our search aiming at establishing a relation between the meV excitations in glasses (boson peak) and the nanoscale glass inhomogeneity. Unfortunately, the very first IXS scans from plasticized PMMA revealed a very strong elastic peak (most likely associated with high small angle scattering) from which it turned out impossible to distinguish phonon lines. In the remaining allocated beamtime, we decided to investigate pure DBP under pressure, as DBP is known as an "intermediate" glass-former.</p><p>Measurements were done at room temperature, i.e about 120K above the glass transition of DBP.</p><p>As an illustration of the obtained results, Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> shows the inelastic scans of DBP at Q=2nm -1 as a function of pressure , while Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> shows the inelastic scans at 4 kbar as a function of Q (= dispersing of the excitation). The sound velocity deduced from the dispersion relation E=f(Q) is of 2600 m/s, in agreement with Billouin light scattering data. As already found for other liquids and glasses, the width of the excitations displayed a Q 2 dependence, thereby indicating a structural disorder effect for which no satisfactory explanation has yet been found.</p><p>Fig. 1a Fig. 1b -1 5 -1 0 -5 0 5 1 0 1 5 -1 5 -1 0 -5 0 5 1 0 1 5 m eV 0 k bar 0.5 k bar 1 k bar 1.5 k bar 2 k bar 2.5 k bar 3 k bar 3.5 k bar 4 k bar 5.5 nm -1 4.5 nm -1 4 nm -1 2.5 nm -1 2 nm -1 1.5 nm -1 1 nm -1 QP ISUHVVXUH 'LVSHUVLRQ DW NEDU m eV 8 6 4 2 0 Ω L o re n tzia n (m e V) 5 4 3 2 1 0 Q (n m -1 )</p><p>'LVSHUVLRQ j NEDU</p><p>In order to complete the picture of the collective dynamics of DBP under pressure, we have performed Brillouin light scattering investigations in the same pressure range. Comparison of these latter data with the thereby reported IXS ones unveils an unexpected discrepancy between the two, in the low pressure regime (0 -2 kbar). See attached proposal for further details.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Eugène DUVAL, L.P.C.M.L., Univ.
