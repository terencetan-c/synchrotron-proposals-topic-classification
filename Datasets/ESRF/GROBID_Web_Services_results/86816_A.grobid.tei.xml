<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Characterisation of line roughness is a big challenge in microelectronic. In particular, the lateral roughness of lines is quite complex to extract with current method like AFM or SEM. The use of SAXS in transmission mode can be an answer with a high resolution expected. The main goal of this experiment is to evaluate the capability of SAXS for measuring lateral roughness of lines.</p><p>For this first experiment we decided to prepare lines grating in cleanroom with controlled roughness (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). It means that the amplitude and periodicity of the lateral roughness is defined a priori by the lithographic process. For periodic roughness, different type of roughness (LER, LWR, ALWR) have been prepared. For all the analyzed samples during this run, the roughness frequency is monomodal, for simplicty of data treatment. During the allocated beam time, three type of measurements have been performed: i) we first measured a 2D image of the line gratings scattering; ii) we measured using a punctual detector the line profile of different orders of diffraction transverse to the lines and parallel to the lines, and iii) we measured also these peak profiles at different tilts Œ© of the samples (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). From these measurements, we could extract the pitch of the grating, the shape and width of the lines, but also the roughness period and the roughness amplitude.</p><p>We first measured a sample without programmed roughness. This sample can be considered as a reference when correlating with the others samples. Two kind of roughness named "LWR" and "ALWR" where measured at different amplitudes.</p><p>Each sample has been finely aligned on the BM32 goniometer. In particular we took attention to the alignment of the patterned area on the rotation axis, since the lines grating area measure only 250x250¬µm¬≤. Moreover, as we used punctual acquisition, it was important to check that the lines were completely horizontal in order to measure accurately the diffracted intensities. The figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows a typical 2D images of a line gratings with controlled roughness. Spots along the qx axis are related in position to the pitch and in relative intensity to the line width. The spots along the qy axis are related to the lateral roughness of the lines. As for the equatorial spots, the positions and relative intensities of these spots give access to the roughness period and to the roughness amplitude. In a first analysis of these images, we can extract already the pitch of the gratings. Using the measurements at different Œ© values, we can also extract the shape of the lines. Thanks to the qx measurements at qy = 0, for our reference sample, we obtain the following values: a pitch =199.3nm, line height = 98.0nm, CDline = 42.0 nm and Œ≤ =-2.10¬∞. First, parameter was calculated directly with a peak fitting and the relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ùêø = 2ùúã ùëû ùë• ùëõ</formula><p>. For the other parameters we used our own analysis software with a reverse problem solving.</p><p>With these different measurements we could also study the impact of roughness amplitude on intensity of diffraction. For instance, the figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the third diffraction order along qx, measured on samples with ALWR type of roughness and several roughness amplitudes. The relative decrease in intensity between the two peaks is clearly related to the roughness amplitude as reported in figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. We conclude that we could extract roughness information with a sub-nm resolution.</p><p>qy = 0 qx = 0</p><p>This experiment also confirms that we can distinguish LER and LWR type of roughness thanks to the form factor impact. For instance in case of LER, the minima of intensity are aligned on qy as showed in our simulations.</p><p>All the measurements are still under treatment and a publication at the SPIE conference dedicated to CD analysis is expected in beginning of 2018.</p><p>For the next step of this study we have prepared new samples with a roughness closer to the "natural" roughness created by the lithographic process, i.e. with multiple periods, variable amplitudes as described by autocorrelation function and spectral density. We have also reduced locally (under the patterned area) the Si substrate thickness in order to obtain a better contrast.
