The DNA damage induced by pks+ E. coli is followed by a transient activation of the DNA damage cellular signaling pathway, megalocytosis, signs of incomplete DNA repair, chromosomal instability and increasing level of mutations in host cells <ref type="bibr">(Cuevas-Ramos et al. 2010</ref>); lesions which are frequently observed in cancers <ref type="bibr">(Boffetta et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Genetic and functional analyses of the pks island indicate that it encodes non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthetases (PKS), which are required for the production of one or more polyketide -non-ribosomal peptide (PK-NRP) hybrid compounds designated colibactin <ref type="bibr">(Nougayrède et al. 2006</ref>). In addition to NRPS and PKS, the pks island encodes the peptidase ClbP, which was identified as a crucial enzyme in colibactin maturation <ref type="bibr">(Dubois et al. 2010)</ref>. In this work, we identified small molecules, which inhibit ClbP, with K i values in the nanomolar range and determined the crystal structure of ClbP in complex with these compounds. The coordinates and structural factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB IDs: 4E6W and 4E6X).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>The structure of ClbP in complex with two nanomolar inhibitors (compounds 1 and 2) was determined by x-ray diffraction to confirm their ability to bind ClbP active site and understand how compounds having differences in chemical structures can exhibit such closely related inhibiting activity. The structures were refined against diffraction data extending to 2.19 and 2.24 Å resolutions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). *, values for the highest range of resolution</p><p>The electron density map showed well defined density throughout most of the structure.</p><p>The stereochemical parameters of the model were satisfactory; a Ramachandran plot showed no residues in disallowed regions of Φ/ψ space and 98% of residues were a favoured conformation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We determined the first crystal structure of ClbP in complex with ligands. These two ligands are nanomolar inhibitor of ClbP and may be interesting tools in decreasing the production of genotoxic compounds synthesized by pks island. We recently identified a third inhibitor of ClbP and are planning to another proposal/experiment at ESRF.  <ref type="bibr">programs, respectively (Emsley et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Murshudov, Vagin, and E. J. Dodson 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steiner, Lebedev, and Murshudov 2003)</ref>. Cross-validation was used throughout and 5 % of the data were used for the Rfree calculation. The stereochemical quality of the models was monitored with the PROCHECK program <ref type="bibr">(Laskowski, Moss, and Thornton 1993)</ref>. Ramachandran plots were calculated by <ref type="bibr">RAMPAGE (Lovell et al. 2003)</ref>. Processing and crystallographic refinement statistics are listed in supplemental table 2.

The threedimensional structure of ClbP consists of two structural regions, all-α and α/β. The conserved motifs 95 SMSK and 186 YAS, which correspond to the catalytic center in S12 enzymes of the MEROPS classification (Rawlings, Barrett, and Bateman 2010), are located in a large groove(Dubois et al. 2010). The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the Cα positions is approximately 0.31 Å between the complex structures and the apoenzyme, showing no dramatic change in geometry resulting from the binding of inhibitors.the same area of the catalytic pocketThe positions of the inhibitors in the active site were unambiguously identified in the 2Fo-Fc omit density maps (figure1).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><figDesc>For compound 1, two C atoms of the aromatic ring were at 2.8 Å and 3.0 Å of the Tyr188 hydroxyl function and the N atom of Gln330 respectively. The geometry of these close contacts corresponds to a NH•••π interaction involving Gln330 and a CH•••O interaction involving Tyr186(Cotesta and Stahl 2006; Malone et    al. 1997). The plane of the aromatic ring was parallel with β-strand β11 and established a πstacking-like interaction(Bendova et al. 2007)  with the peptide bond between residues Gly328 and Gly329. For compound 2, the chlorine atom established with the aromatic ring of Tyr188 a Cl•••π electrostatic interaction (Chlorine-aromatic centroid distance: 3.6 Å), which exhibited a face-on geometry as previously reported(Imai et al. 2008). One oxygen atom of the sulfonamide was positioned in close contact with the C and N atoms of the Gly328-Gly329 peptide bond (3.1 Å and respectively). Because of the π electron resonance cloud of peptide bonds, this close interaction resembled a Lone pair•••π interaction(Egli and Sarkhel 2007; Jain, Ramanathan, and    Sankararamakrishnan 2009; Mooibroek, Gamez, and Reedijk 2008).</figDesc></figure>

The enzymatic domain of ClbP, was produced in the E. coli BL21(DE3) from the pET9a derivative plasmid pClbPpep(Dubois et al. 2010). Bacteria were cultured in terrific-broth II medium (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) supplemented with sorbitol 400mM (Sigma-Aldrich), betaine 2.5 mM (Sigma-Aldrich), and kanamycin 50 µg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich). The expression of proteins was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-ß-Dthiogalactopyranoside (Euromedex). The purification of ClbP was performed as previously described(Dubois et al. 2010). The purification of FmtA-like and ZmaM was carried out by ionexchange chromatography into a HiTrapTM Q SepharoseTM High Performance column (Healthcare Europe, Velizy-villacoublay, France) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0 to 500 mM). The elution peak was then purified by ionexchange chromatography into a HiTrapTM Q SepharoseTM High Performance column (Healthcare Europe) equilibrated with 50 mM MES pH 6.0 and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0 to 500 mM). The elution peaks were extensively dialyzed against NaCl 50 mM Tris-HCl 5 mM pH 7.0 and concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. The purified enzymes were more than 95% homogeneous as determined by Coomassie blue staining after SDS-PAGE (Laemmli 1970).Crystallization and structure determination. ClbP crystals were grown in hanging drops over a solution of 0.8 M monosodium dipotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) as previously reported(Dubois et al. 2010). The crystals were soaked in the crystallization buffer supplemented with 50 mM boronic acid compounds and cryo-protected with 30% sucrose before flashcooling in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected using a Q315r ADSC-CCD detector on ESRF beamline 23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Reflexions were indexed, integrated, and scaled using CCP4 package(Potterton et al. 2003). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER (McCoy 2007) and ClbP x-ray structure (pdb ID, 3O3V) as a search model. The structure was automatically and manually refined with REFMAC5 and COOT</figDesc></figure>
