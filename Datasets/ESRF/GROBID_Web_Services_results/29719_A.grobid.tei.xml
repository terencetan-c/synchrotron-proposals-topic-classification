Une méthode d'analyse, basée sur l'utilisation répétée de l'imagerie microtomographique à rayons X, a été développée pour suivre en détail l'évolution de la structure et de l'interface fluide-solide de l'échantillon, tandis que sa porosité et sa perméabilité augmentaient au cours de sa dissolution. Plusieurs mécanismes à l'origine de l'augmentation rapide de la perméabilité ont été identifiés. Au début de l'expérience, cette augmentation a été reliée à la dissolution et à la migration concomitantes de particules carbonatées. Ensuite, la perméabilité a continué d'augmenter par suite de la dissolution des aspérités à l'interface fluide-solide, et de l'accroissement de la connectivité du réseau poral.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Pore network structure, porosity and permeability of reservoir rocks can be strongly altered when they are subject to natural or anthropogenic hydrogeochemical forcing. In natural environment, reactive fluids induce pore microgeometry and flow properties complex alteration patterns due to the high level of mineralogical and structural heterogeneity. Experimental constraints are necessary to identify the controlling processes and to work out predictive models.</p><p>Recent advances in X-ray computed microtomography (CµT) have considerably improved the direct measurement of multi-granular porous media structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Coker et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lindquist et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Delerue et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lindquist and Venkatarangen, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Proussevitch and Sahagian, 2001)</ref>. CµT is a 3D nondestructive radiographic imaging technique with a spatial resolution limited by the width of the beam, the scintillator efficiency, the number of pixels on the camera and the X-ray absorption coefficient of the rock-forming minerals. Currently, the technique allows the acquisition of 2048 2 pixels radiographies of rock with a pixel size up to 0.3 µm using a synchrotron as X-ray source. In earth science, CµT is often used to determine 3D pore structure in order to constrain flow models for example (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Spanne et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cole et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Auzerais et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nakashima and Watanabe, 2002)</ref>. Moreover, CµT is a perfect tool to perform dynamic experiments because the acquisition time is sufficiently short (about 2 h). Accordingly, structural changes due to thermal, mechanical or hydrochemical processes can be investigated by alternating experimental episodes and imaging stages. A few experiments using CµT have recently been published, for example, in relation with the sintering or compaction of glass beads <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernard et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bernard et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Richard et al., 2003)</ref>, the crack growth in mortar under compressive loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Landis et al., 2003)</ref>, or the dissolution of fractures in carbonated rocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gouze et al., 2003)</ref>. Presently, most of the technological and data processing problems have been resolved and complex media can be investigated.</p><p>The aim of this work is to document the relationships between the alteration of a natural biogenic porous limestone and the permeability changes due the reactive percolation of CO 2 -enriched water. In the petroleum industry, massive CO 2 injection is routinely used to enhance oil recovery. It has been proposed to apply this method to underground carbon sequestration for mitigating its level increase in the atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(Lackner, 2003)</ref>. Rationally, depleted oil reservoirs are potential geologic host formations. In these environments, carbonates are present either as the main minerals or as the cement fraction in sandstones. Their thermodynamic equilibrium depends strongly on the CO 2 activity in the fluid. Furthermore, the dissolution and precipitation kinetics of those species are fast compared to that of silicate and alumino-silicate species, so that they are the first minerals that are altered by acidic fluids. In the course of supercritical CO 2 injection in depleted reservoirs, the interactions of carbon dioxide with formation water and minerals involve high temperature (e.g. 50 to 150°C), high pressure (e.g. 5 MPa to 60 MPa) and frequently high salinity (up to several molar). Theoretically, these reservoir conditions can be reproduced in the laboratory. Nevertheless, some physico-chemical parameters are still unknown, such as kinetic laws for mineral reactions. Reliable comparisons between experiment and model could not be made as long as these parameters will be unspecified. Moreover, some unknowns still exist at low temperature and pressure. Specifically, carbonate mass transfers and their feedback on hydrodynamic property (i.e. porosity, permeability, dispersivity) changes are difficult to model in polycrystalline heterogeneous rocks. In particular, experimental data are insufficient to tackle the phenomenological relationships between hydrodynamic properties, pore network and reactive surfaces. The understanding of these relationships requires, in a first approach, to do experiment on materials with well-defined geometry and simple mineralogy, for which solubility, kinetics and mechanisms of reaction are well-known. The ideal system with which to start is certainly calcite dissolution at low temperature and P CO 2 less than 0.11 MPa, (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Plummer et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Plummer and Busemberg, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chou et al., 1989)</ref>.</p><p>At field scale, direct measurements of the permeability in the course of injection are challenging and difficult to extrapolate for predictive purposes. Alternatively, permeability, porosity and pore geometry can be measured on cores like their changes in response to mechanical, hydrothermal and geochemical constraints. However, albeit those parameters are highly correlated, relationships between the connected porosity and the permeability are complex and highly variable depending on the rock structure and mineralogy, and on the geological process involved (e.g. plastic or elastic compaction, chemical alteration, diagenesis, or microcracking; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bernabé et al., (2003)</ref> for a recent review on the subject). This issue has been intensively studied for more than eighty years mainly in relation to oil exploitation. Several empirical or phenomenological formulas have been proposed to link permeability to the relevant pore geometry parameters, e.g. total porosity, Euclidean and fractal porosity, tortuosity, hydraulic radius and surface-to-volume ratio (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Walsh and Brace, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bernabé and Revil, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Revil and Cathles, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aharonov et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pape et al., 1999)</ref>. The most usual models based on the original work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Carman (1937)</ref> establish that permeability k and effective porosity φ (i.e. pore space that effectively conduces to fluid flow) are linked through a power-law relationship, k ∞ φ n , were n may be a noninteger exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(David et al., 1994)</ref> or alternatively by a linear combination of porosity power-laws: <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pape et al., 1999)</ref>. Asymptotically, it can be considered that the exponent n varies continuously with the evolution of the</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k a i n i i ∝ ∑ φ</formula><p>porosity/permeability, so that n is the slope of the tangent at any point of the log(k) versus log(φ) curve. Experimental evidence indicates that a given value of n is generally valid over a finite range of evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bourbié and Zinszner, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mok et al., 2002)</ref>. In most cases, and especially when chemical processes are involved, it is still not clear if the variation of the exponent n is linked to the pore structure or to sequential activation of distinctly different alteration regimes. In this last case, the predictability of the model is poor if n is not a function of φ alone or rather of a restricted number of independent measurable parameters. To overcome this problem, <ref type="bibr">Aharanov et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bernabé et al. (2003)</ref> proposed to relate k to distinctly different porosity types. Assuming that only a fraction of the total porosity φ T contributes to transport, these authors defined an effective and a non-effective porosity. Non-effective porosity, associated to areas where the fluid velocity is very low or null, such as pits and protrusions on a rough interface, or non-connected or transverse pore paths, is not taken into account for permeability calculations. Those structural parameters can theoretically be extracted from CµT imaging albeit some computational steps are still challenging.</p><p>In this paper, we present the first quantitative results from a percolation experiment of a structurally heterogeneous limestone rock. The objective is to perfect an experimental and analytical method, in order to improve the understanding of the relationships between chemical reactions, microgeometry, fluid-rock interface, porosity and permeability. In the next two sections, we detail the experimental procedure consisting in three successive flow-through and CµT imaging stages. The image processing used to quantify the geometrical changes of the core is also described. Then, results are analysed in terms of chemical reaction and structural control on the k -φ relationship evolution. Finally, some conclusions and perspectives are proposed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Description of Rock Sample</head><p>The rock sample was extracted from a quarry in the Lérouville formation, a middle Oxfordian age crinoidal limestone that crops out in the Lérouville region in the Paris Basin (Meuse). The rock, a biogenic quasi-pure limestone, consists of millimetre size echinoderma fragments cemented during secondary crystallization process. The rocks is essentially composed of single crystals of calcite, but minor fraction of carbonated micritic mould is present (maximum 5%). The micritic mould is composed of microcrystalline calcite and rare altered minerals containing Fe, Al and Si (less than 1%) that probably correspond to clays and iron hydroxide (for more details and petrographic illustrations, see <ref type="bibr">Brosse et al., 2005, this issue)</ref>. The occurrence of the microcrystalline calcite (low magnesian calcite), occupying some preferential flow paths, can be related to early diagenesis. Part of the microcrystalline calcite presents dissolution patterns that are attributed to the flow of meteoric water in the limestone, certainly during telogenesis (Tertiary stripping of the series). During its geological evolution the burial depth of the sediment did not reach more than few hundred metres, and the natural P CO 2 probably did not experience values higher than 0.04 MPa <ref type="bibr">(Coudrain-Ribstein et al., 1998)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Flow-Through Experiment</head><p>A limestone cylindrical core of 9 mm diameter and 21 mm length is prepared to suit the experimental procedure. The core is coated with epoxy resin and fixed with silicon glue in a Teflon ® sleeve to seal the core periphery. Then, the core is placed into the percolation cell. To initialize the experiment, the core is saturated under vacuum with calcite-equilibrated water. CO 2 -enriched water is injected at constant flow rate in the sample installed in the percolation cell with a confining pressure equal to the pressure at the sample inlet. At different stages of the reactive percolation process, the sample is removed from the cell and imaged with X-Ray CµT. The experiment is conducted at room temperature. Initially, three fluid bottles of distinct composition are prepared: -deionized water then equilibrated with limestone at atmospheric partial pressure of CO 2 (P CO 2 ≈ 10 -4.5 MPa); -deionized water; -0.010 ± 0.001M NaCl solution prepared from reagentgrade NaCl diluted in deionized water. Each of those fluids is used during a given percolation stage. A "percolation stage" of duration ∆t = t i+1 -t i denotes a flow-through experiment with constant flow rate and constant properties of the inlet fluid. X-ray CµT imaging of the core is performed before the experiment (t = t 0 ) and at the end of each percolation stage (t = t 1 , t 2 and t 3 ). The times at the end of the first (leading to t 1 ), the second (t 2 ) and the third (t 3 ) reactive percolation stage are, respectively, 1 h 24 min, 13 h 54 min and 22 h 24 min from the initial state. Inlet fluids, initially degassed, are maintained equilibrated with carbon dioxide at the partial pressure of 0.10 ± 0.01 MPa during the experiment. The inlet pH is recorded continuously in the bottle to detect potential CO 2 saturation changes.</p><p>The fluid is injected into the sample at constant flow rate using a dual piston pump. The flow rate Q is fixed at 100 or 300 cm 3 • h -1 (2.78 10 -8 or 8.33 10 -8 m 3 • s -1 ), depending on the stage of the experiment. The hydrodynamic and compositional conditions are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Pressure is measured at the inlet in the range 0 ± 0.00015 -3 ± 0.0015 MPa using a computer-controlled two-stage pressure sensor system in order to increase the accuracy in the ranges 0-0.3 MPa and 0-3 MPa according to the value of the inlet pressure. The pressure at the outlet is set to about 0.13 MPa using a calibrated back-pressure controller to avoid degassing during the experiment. The outlet pH and pressure are monitored. Inlet fluid is analysed prior to CO 2 saturation and effluents are sampled. Samples were collected for chemical analysis of the cation concentrations, using electrophoresis and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES). A schematic representation of the percolation apparatus is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.</p><p>Changes in permeability are measured throughout the percolation experiment by measuring the pressure drop ∆P between the inlet and the outlet of the sample. According to Darcy's law, the ratio of the volumetric flow rate Q (m 3 •s -1 ) over the pressure difference ∆P is directly related to the permeability of the sample k (m 2 ), by:</p><p>(1)</p><p>where L is the length of the sample in the flow direction (m), S is the section of the sample (m 2 ) and µ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa•s). Permeability values are reported in mD, (1mD ≈ 0.987 10 -15 m 2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">X-Ray Micro Tomography</head><p>The microgeometry of the core is characterised throughout the experiment using X-ray microtomography. The X-ray linear attenuation coefficient of a sample depends on its chemical composition and on the energy of the X-ray beam, and is proportional to the rock assemblage density. The tomography apparatus installed at the ID19 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) takes advantage of the homogeneous, parallel, monochromatic, and highly coherent very high photon flux produced by the synchrotron. So, the scanning of 1 cm thick cylindrical core of carbonate is tractable. The detection device is composed of a shutter controlling the exposure time, an X-ray/visible light converter, an optical system and an adapted detector (14-bit dynamic CCD (for charged coupled device) camera with a 2048 x 2048 pixel chip (FReLoN camera). With the selected optics, the pixel size is 4.91 µm. The core is fixed on a mechanical bench; all scans are perpendicular to the cylinder axis. The incident beam illuminates the entire diameter of the core in order to decrease as much as possible the diffusion effect and the resulting reconstruction artefacts. As the entire core cannot be imaged in one run, the beam is adjusted to image the part close to the fluid injection side of the core (at about 1 mm from the inlet surface). A total of 1200 radiographies, taken from 0 to 180 degrees with a 0.15 angular degrees increment, are required to obtain high quality images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). An efficient back projection algorithm is used to reconstruct the 3D volume structure from the 2D radiographies. Here, HST (for high speed tomography) software based on Fourier inversion is used <ref type="bibr">(Hammersley, 2001)</ref>. Radiographies are filtered before the reconstruction in order to eliminate the random noise due to high energy diffracted photons that may go through the lead shield of the camera.</p><p>Four scans are taken: at the initial state (t 0 ), and after the three stages of the reactive percolation (t 1 , t 2 and t 3 ). Results presented here correspond to four volumes V t0 , V t1 , V t2 and V t3 of 2048 × 2048 × 1405 voxels corresponding to the common field of view of the sample imaged at t 0 , t 1 , t 2 and t 3 , respectively. Because the linear X-ray attenuation coefficient is a function of elemental composition of the object, the absorption maps can be directly related to the chemical distribution in the sample.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dissolution Patterns</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> displays cross-sections of the sample observed in microtomography at the initial state, and shows the pore structure evolution after each stage of the percolation experiment. Note that the different cross-sections are not exactly superimposable because of uncertainties on the core position relating to the camera between the different imaging steps (see Section 2.2). Nevertheless, we can observe clearly that both the porosity and the connectivity globally increase from stage 2.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> presents the differences between initial and final morphology. In the experiment, the initial rough contours of the grains are progressively smoothed. At the grain scale, the roughness of initial serrated grains decreases; syntaxial rough cement also disappears. The porous channel contours tend to be rounded. We also presume that the echinoderma monocrystals dissolution may occur preferentially along some crystallographic axis, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: some initially round echinoderma fragments tend to dissolve along some angular and planar faces. Nevertheless, the roughness of some micro porous grains initially smoothly coated with recrystallized cement may increase locally as cement dissolves; then, the intragranular porosity of echinoderma is exposed to the moving fluid (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Quantification of Pore Structure and Surface Evolution</head><p>The next step of image processing is to replace the different volumes in the reference frame. Indeed, as the core is removed from its support between two image acquisitions, it never falls exactly in the same position, and some translation and rotation exist between the different images. Rigid transformation has to be applied to the different images. Theoretically, control voxels corresponding to recognizable unaltered grains can be used to determine this rigid transformation. Practically, it is very Cross-sectional images of the limestone microgeometry obtained by X-ray micro-tomography following its dissolution in the plug-flow apparatus, at a) t 0 (initial); b) t 1 (after 1 h 24 min); c) t 2 (after 13 h 54 min); d) t 3 (after 22 h 24 min).</p></div>

The lines marked "1" (white), "2" (dark) and "3" (dark) correspond respectively to the fluid-solid interface position at t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 . It appears clearly that during the first stage of the percolation experiment, the modifications mainly concern the "micritic phase" with dissolution and particle mobilization: a particle that went out the pore is marked "O" and a particle that came into the pore is marked "I".</p></div>

Using a large number of points in association with a least square fitting procedure permits the first two volumes V t0 and V t1 to be handled, but the two other volumes are noisy because of difficulties during acquisition, and the results obtained using this approach are not considered satisfactory. Alternatively, an improved registration method is under to treat the complete series of 3D volumes. In this paper, we only consider four small sub-volumes SV ti of (2 mm) 3 in order to test a new approach to quantify the volume and surface evolutions.</p><p>The four sub-volumes, SV t0 to SV t3 , corresponding to subvolumes at times t 0 to t 3 , are registered in 3D and then it is possible to visualise the evolution of the fluid-solid interface (I fs ) on cross-sections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). This figure clearly demonstrates that it is possible to follow accurately the evolution of the fluid-solid interface I fs during the percolation experiment.</p><p>To facilitate the quantification of this evolution, the information contained in the four sub-volumes (a value between 0 and 255 for each voxel of SV t0 to SV t3 ) is compacted in a single one noted SV E . The value affected to a voxel of SV E is calculated by the following procedure: -For each 3D sub-volume, a threshold value is selected (see Section 2.3 for more details). A voxel with a value above byte × ∑</p><p>this threshold is considered as a matrix volume voxel; otherwise it is a pore volume voxel. -For each voxel of SV E we consider the value of the corresponding voxel of SV t3 . If the voxel value corresponds to the matrix, the highest bit (bit number (n bit ) 7) of the byte associated to the voxel is set to one; if not, it is set to zero. -The process is repeated for SV t2 to SV t0 to define the value of the bit numbers 6 to 4 for the byte associated to each voxel of SV E . -The four last bits (n bit 3 to 0) of each byte in the volume SV E are set to zero. At the end of the procedure (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>), each voxel of SV E has one of the 16 possible values. Each of those values corresponds to a unique scenario where the voxel is successively in the solid or the pore volume at the four different stages. The histogram of the values at the SV E voxels is given in Figure <ref type="figure">6b</ref>. It reveals that 6 separate values of the 16 possible correspond to 99.4% of the voxels. Those values are indicated in Figure <ref type="figure">6b</ref> by their code on the four highest bit numbers. The corresponding scenarios are described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p><p>To continue towards quantification, the sub-volume SV E is divided in 6 regions (R1 to R6) corresponding to the 6 classes of voxels described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The residuals voxels (0.6% corresponding to the 10 other values) are distributed between R4 (48), R5 (112) and R6 (240) depending of their values. Each voxel being labelled, it is easy to visualise (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) and to quantify the volume differences between the different stages. From the labelled data set, the surface separating each region can be evaluated (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, an estimation of I fs can be calculated for each stage of the evolution (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</p><p>The shifting of fluid-rock interface in the course of the experiment is not uniform as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. During the first short percolation experiment, we did not observe any noticeable change at the fluid-rock interface, excepted particle displacement in the porous network. The shifting of I fs is more important in the narrow pore (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, on the left).

Examining carefully the expression of I fs given on Table <ref type="table">4</ref> (column 3) it can be seen that some surface elements are in common between two stages (for instance S 1-5 , S 1-6 , S 2-5 and S 2-6 between stage 2 and 3). Those unchanged areas (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, column 4) correspond to surface elements belonging to I fs where no noticeable modification has been detected.

Different methods can be used to identify each voxel as belonging to a pore or a grain. Here, a simple thresholding is applicable because distributions of the values corresponding to the pores and the rock matrix are well separated on the histograms (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The determination of the appropriate threshold is essential in this approach. However, the pore and the rock matrix phases are not defined by a single value in the grey scale; for a given material, the distribution of the attenuation coefficient is spread out in the histogram, resulting of inherent noise of the imaging technique and of finite resolution effects. For the different peaks in the histogram, it is nevertheless possible to consider that the true linear X-ray attenuation coefficients of the different materials are located at the maximum peak values. For a rock made of only two materials (bimodal histogram), a good estimate of the threshold can be the arithmetic mean of the two values for which intensity is maximum in the histogram. The presence of the micritic mould slightly alters the shape of the histograms and better estimates of the threshold values have been obtained by visual inspection of several sections on which isolines have been drawn (like in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). The threshold value is chosen equal to 95, 95, 99 and 92 for V t0 to V t3 , respectively. The porosity is equal to the sum of the voxels of count lower than the threshold value divided by the total number of voxels considered.

Porosity values for initial state and after the different experimental stages are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>. We also computed the porosity change along the flow direction (z axis), by calculating porosity for each cross section (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</p><p>The porosity of the rock was first measured by Hg injection on a sample volume of about 1 cm 3 adjacent to the core. This yielded a value of 14.1% which is close to the average value of 15%, measured by the triple-weighting technique on several cores sampled in the same formation. However, the porosity value may be less, depending on the intensity of the secondary crystallisation process. Conversely, porosity evaluated before the percolation experiment from the CµT (volume V t0 ) is 10.8% with a precision of ± 0.5%. The porosity distribution along the core axis is homogeneous with a weak spatial variation (see Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). This value is used as reference for the core porosity φ 0 before the experiment. The different values of porosity changes are calculated by three different methods: -core-scale porosity estimated from Ca concentration removed (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)); -core-scale porosity measured on the CµT volumes (V ti ); -microscale porosity calculated on sub-volume extracts (SV ti ). The evolution of porosity during the percolation experiment is reported Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>.</p><p>Estimations from chemical measurement give an overall increase of core-scale porosity of 0.3, 4.3 and 2.2% during stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3, respectively. The initial porosity of the 8 mm 3 sub-volume SV t0 is 27.3%, but misrepresentative of the porosity of the rock, in view of the size of echinoderma fragments. During the first percolation experiment, 1.7% of the volume is removed, but 1.1% of solid particles appeared in SV t1 . The global porosity change in this region is thus only 0.6%. Porosity increases by 8.4% and 4.6% during stage 2 and stage 3, respectively, without any noticeable contribution of particles.</p><p>We observe in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> that the distribution of porosity at t 0 is variable along the flow axis. The initial average porosity φ 0 of the 3D volume V t0 is equal to 10.8%, with a standard deviation σ φ0 of 1.8. During the dissolution, the porosity does not increase uniformly according to the initial porosity value and to the distance to the inlet of the sample. The porosity increases more in the area where initial porosity is higher. The standard deviation of porosity distribution increases, σ φVt2 = 2.7 and σ φVt3 = 2.8 after stages 2 and 3, respectively (φ Vt2 = 15.3%; φ Vt3 = 18.8%). The higher the initial porosity the more it increases in the course of dissolution (whereas the dissolution is more important in narrow pore paths, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). That can be easily related to the pore size: the wider a pore, the larger the surface exposed to the acidic fluid and the more the porosity will increase during rock/fluid interface displacement. Results show that the porosity increase is not uniform along the flow axis; moreover, the dissolution is more marked near the inlet of the core (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The porosity difference between final and initial state near the inlet of the sample is 9.30%, whereas it is only 6.73% near the outlet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Rate of Dissolution</head><p>Differences in Ca concentration and pH between core outlet and inlet can be directly related to the progress of the chemical reaction of calcite dissolution. The differences in pH values (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) between the three stages are linked to the composition of the inlet solution. Values of pH are almost invariant (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), but a weak decrease, attributed to an uncontrolled slow increase of the P CO 2 in the input solution, is recorded. The calcium concentration values measured at the output are variable during the experiment (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>Assessing the influence of the input fluid composition (i.e. ionic strength, Ca initial concentration, etc.) on the dissolution rate is tricky because flow velocity (i.e. the resident time of the fluid in the core) was variable during the experiment (100 or 300 cm 3 •h -1 ), and because the sampling frequency was relatively low.</p><p>The resident time of fluid in the core is: t R = L/u, where L is the core length (m), u the mean flow rate (m•s -1 ); t R is short compared to the kinetics of the calcite dissolution process, and the solution remains very undersaturated (the saturation index Ω of calcite is about 10 -3 ). Because the resident time is higher for stage 3 at 100 cm 3 •h -1 than for the others stages at 300 cm 3 •h -1 , the progress of the chemical reaction is more important, explaining that Ca concentration is about 3 times higher for stage 3 than for stage 1 and stage 2 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>It is generally admitted that the equation describing the rate (mol•s -1 ) of calcite dissolution is <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lasaga, 1981)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">r = Sr•k•(1 -Ω) α</formula><p>, where Sr is the reactive surface of the mineral (m 2 ), k is global kinetic rate constant of dissolution (mol•m -2 •s -1 ), Ω denotes the calcite saturation index, and α is an exponent. Far from equilibrium, k can be described <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Plummer et al., 1978)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">by: k = k 1 a H + + k 2 a H 2 CO 3 * + k 3 a H 2 O ,</formula><p>where a i denotes the activity of the specie i, k 1 , k 2 and k 3 are kinetic rate constants equal to 5.12 10 -1 , 3.45 10 -4 and 1.19 10 -6 mol•m -2 •s -1 respectively at 25°C. Far from equilibrium and at relatively low pH (e.g. pH &lt; 4.5), the rate of dissolution is pH dependent. Because H + are consumed as the fluid is flowing along the core, the term k 1 a H + and therefore r decreases progressively and dissolution occurs preferentially near the inlet of the sample, as observed in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Indeed, porosity measurements using CµT are performed on the part of the core close to the inlet; so that they do not represent the core scale porosity average and values are expected to be higher than the porosity measured from the chemical analysis.</p><p>A basic concept in chemical kinetics is that chemical reactions result from a set of serial chemical and physical processes, including: 1 diffusion of the reactants through solution to the solid surface; 2 adsorption of the reactants at the reaction site; 3 chemical reaction that may involve several stages, including the hydration of species; 4 desorption of the products away from the reaction site; 5 diffusion of the products away from the surface to the solution.</p><p>In most natural systems, the surface reactions at the mineral-fluid interface (steps 2, 3, 4) are assumed to control the kinetics of the reaction. But for calcite at low pH, the chemical reaction is so fast that competition exists between the surface reactions (steps 2, 3 and 4) and the diffusive transport of the reacting species (steps 1 and 5) at the solid-liquid interface (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rickard and Sjöberg, 1983)</ref>. Moreover in moving solutions, advective transport is substantially faster than molecular diffusion, so the renewal of fluid is enhanced near the interface, and the dissolution rate increases with the fluid velocity. Plot of average porosity along the flow direction axis z, at times t 0 , t 1 , t 2 and t 3 : before injection (joined open black triangles), after 1 h 24 min (joined grey crosses), after 13 h 54 min (joined black diamonds), after 22 h 24 min (joined grey circles).</p><p>According to Darcy's law the average flow rate is: u = U/φ, where U is the filtration flow rate (m•s -1 ). The average flow rate is 1.39 10 -3 m•s -1 for stages 1 and 2 at 300 cm 3 •h -1 , and 3.24 10 -4 m•s -1 for stage 3 at 100 cm 3 •h -1 . The effect of the flow rate on dissolution rate is noticeable in our experiment. The calcite dissolution rate is about 1.38 time faster for stage 2 in comparison to stage 3 (4.09 10 -8 versus 2.97 10 -8 mol•s -1 ). The dependence of the dissolution rate to the flow rate confirms that the transport processes influence the dissolution rate. In more detail, whereas u varies continuously in the course of the experiment due to porosity increase: -for stage 1 and stage 2 at 300 cm 3 •h -1 , from 1.21 10 -2 to 8.73 10 -3 m•s -1 (for a porosity variation from 10.8% to 15.0%); -for stage 3 at 100 cm 3 •h -1 , from 2.91 10 -3 to 2.55 10 -3 m•s -1 (for a porosity variation from 15.0 to 17.1%), the impact of those weak changes of the fluid velocity is not measurable in the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Permeability-Porosity Relationship</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> shows the evolution of permeability and porosity as function of time. Permeability increases rapidly by one order of magnitude in the early minutes of the experiment. In contrast, porosity remains almost unchanged over the same interval of time. In more detail, permeability increases from 40 to 300 mD within stage 1 while porosity variation is estimated at 0.3%. We also observe a permeability jump after 6 h 30 min of experiment due to a problem in the continuity of pressure measurement. After 9 h of experiment (during stage 2), the permeability reaches 5000 mD (for a porosity change of about 2.3%) and the lack of resolution of the pressure sensors does not enable us to measure the permeability precisely.</p><p>To compare the possible effect of the flow rate and therefore the effect of transport-reaction on permeability evolution, another experiment was done on a similar core sampled close to that one described in this paper. The results show that the increase in the permeability with time was multiplied by 2 when the flow rate increases from 100 to 300 cm 3 •h -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>). At the same time the change in porosity was multiplied by 1.8.</p><p>The increase of the permeability as function of porosity resulting from the calcite dissolution is plotted in a log k versus log φ diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>). One can clearly distinguish two distributions with different φ-k laws. For the early stage of the dissolution, k is proportional to φ 75 . This extremely high permeability increase is attributed to the concomitant dissolution and release of the micritic mould lodged at pore openings, as observed previously on the tomographic cross sections (see Section 2.2). Micritic elements dissolve more rapidly than sparitic crystals because they present a higher reactive surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Roques and Ek, 1973)</ref>. Moreover, the mechanical displacement of the micritic mould at the beginning of the experiment is certainly enhanced by the high hydrodynamic conditions of the experiment; as mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Donaldson et al.

Note that the measurements were obtained on a second Lérouville core sample, taken close to the main Lérouville core sample discussed in the preceding figures. For the second part of the curve presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref>, k is proportional to φ 13 . This high value of n is attributed to the enlargement of connected pores with grain-scale roughness decrease and to connectivity increase. High values of the power law exponent were also reported by other authors when studying chemical alteration or dissolution/precipitation events (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mc Cune et al., 1979)</ref>, compared to others processes, for example compaction or sintering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cune et al. (1979)</ref> to explain the much larger magnitude of the permeability increase observed in their experiments is that particles may be present in the rock and lodged at the pore openings. In the case where mould is present in these pores, and fills up the path for flow, the permeability can increase dramatically due to pore opening during the removal (both mechanically and chemically) of the mould. In addition, these authors supposed that dissolution takes place within only a small fraction of the total pore space. The process described is very similar to the one observed in the early stage of our experiment: during the removal of the micritic mould, the dissolution globally occurs in only a small fraction of the total pore space (only 27.87% of the SV t0 surface participates to a significant dissolution).</p></div>

In the case of transport-limited reaction, as the local dissolution rates are proportional to local fluid velocities, the dissolution is greater in narrow channels than in large pore spaces; consequently to the channel widening, the permeability increases more rapidly with time compared to a surface-limited reaction, in which pores grow equally. As the porosity variation is also localized in narrow channels, the permeability increases also more rapidly with porosity compared to a surfacelimited reaction, in which the porosity variation is distribute all around the pores.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> summarizes schematically, for an assemblage of grains containing micritic mould, the possible geometry and permeability evolution according to the value of Da. For relatively high Da, chemical process is important compared to advective flow. The dissolution occurs mainly at the inlet of the sample and chemical equilibrium can be reached rapidly. Micritic mould at the inlet is removed; k may decrease due to pore clogging near the outlet. Permeability increases dramatically when dissolution front reaches the outlet of the sample. For relative low Da (this experiment), the chemical reaction occurs everywhere along the flow axis. Micritic mould is dissolved and rapidly removed; k increases rapidly with time and continues to increase by increasing pore connectivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>The results from this experimental study throw light on the control by dissolution of microgeometry and flow inside a porous limestone. Processes accompanying flow of CO 2enriched water in a limestone core during 22 h 24 min have been constrained by chemical measurements (pH, P CO 2 , Ca concentration) at the inlet and outlet of the core and permeability measurement throughout the experiment, together with imaging steps using X-ray microtomography. A new methodology, based on 3D image processing, has been proposed to follow in detail the evolution of the core microstructure and fluid-rock surface during the experiment.</p><p>Particle removal observed on 3D imaging of the core geometry involves a large increase in permeability in the early stage of experiment, whereas porosity remains quasi constant over the same time; only a low fraction of the pore space (and so, of the fluid-rock interface) was involved in this process. This phenomenon, assumed during experimental work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mc Cune et al. (1979)</ref>, is measured here using a nondestructive imagery technique. The ability to quantify this kind of phenomenon is a main point in reservoir engineering because the particle displacement is commonly expected close to an injection well.</p><p>In the following episodes of dissolution, permeability increases by reducing the pore wall roughness and increasing the pore path connectivity, as also observed on the 3D images. Increasing volumetric flow rate also increases the rate of limestone dissolution at low pH, as the calcite rate of dissolution is enhanced by the transport-processes; dissolution rate increases with flow velocity. The permeability increase appears also more marked when the process is transport-limited because the narrow pore paths, where flow velocity is higher, are more rapidly opened. As a general rule, the permeability increase for transport-limited reaction is more rapid compared to surface-limited reaction.</p><p>Da kL u ∝ / 190 a) d) c) b) f) e) Time k k 0 Time k k 0 t i t k t' k t j t' j t i t' j t' k t k t j t i t i Figure 13</p><p>Schematic representation of double grain size assemblage evolution in course of dissolution, as a function of Damköhler number.

Reliable prediction of permeability changes as a function of time and space is actually a key for setting up effective CO 2 injection procedures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 a</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 a) a schematic description of the experimental setup; and b) of the X-ray microtomography setup.</figDesc></figure>
