<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experimental set-up including burner and detectors were brought from Lund and installed at the beamline ID-12 for the experiments. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the installed set-up. The time required for installing and adjusting the set-up according to the beamline settings was between 2 and 3 days.</p><p>The absolute photon flux from ID-12 was calibrated for vertical polarization at the point of measurements. The fluxes were 4.710 11 photons s -1 and 2.210 11 photons s -1 , at respectively 7 keV and 8 keV photon energies. Experiments were mostly performed using vertically polarized X-ray radiation. For comparison measurements were also performed with horizontally polarized radiation. Measurements were performed on different types of flames, including sooting ones. The results show that the system was working well. The data is being analyzed in detail and an extended report will be delivered in the future. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows scattering data recorded from a non-sooting flame, where particle concentrations were low.</p><p>It is very important to note that in the coming experiments the detection will be complemented with a new detector part that will cover the gap between SAXS and WAXS (0.7 Å -1 &lt; q &lt; 2 Å -1 ) seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This will give us very important input on the dynamics of nanoparticles and molecules in the size range around 1 nanometer.</p><p>Concluding this pre-report we want to stress the very positive outcome of the campaign: The first sets of experiments were successfully made for vertically polarized radiation on flames. The polarization and photon flux were excellent as well as the general performance of the beamline and the technical support. The results are very encouraging for a continuation and developments of flame-based experiments at the beamline <ref type="bibr">ID-12. Lund, February 29, 2012</ref> Frederik Ossler, PhD, Assoc.
