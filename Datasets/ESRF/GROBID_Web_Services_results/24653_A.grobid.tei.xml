Conversion of this protein from its cellular form (PrPc) to insoluble amyloïd fibrils (PrPSc) is the main event of prion diseases, a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that appear sporadically as well as after hereditary or infectious transmission.</p><p>Prion infectious agent is mainly composed of PrPSc and seems devoid of nucleic acid, a feature that makes this group of diseases exceptional. Spreading of prion into challenged organisms requires expression of cell host PrPc, and is modulated by several mutations in the PrP gene. Transmission of prion across mammal species is apparently facilitated by sequence identity between PrPc and PrPSc. The latter observations suggest that at one point, prion pathogenesis includes recognition of PrPc by the infectious agent or by another unknown factor X, this interaction leading afterward to conversion of PrPc to PrPSc. On the basis of this hypothesis, structural changes leading to stability changes or alteration of ligand binding are expected from disease-related sequence variations of PrP. To idenify the structural changes associated to disease-related sequence variations of PrP, we have undertaken to determine its structure by X-ray crystallography.</p><p>During our visit, we tested crystals constituted of sheep recombinant PrP(114-231) in complex with VRQ14 Fab fragment. Space group is P21212 (a=91Å, b=145Å, c=43Å), with one complex molecule per unit cell. Data were measured to 2,5 Å resolution (Rmerge 3,3%,). Structure was solved by molecular replacement using Fab and prion models. Examination of the structure gives insight into the role of disease related positions in prion structure and stability. Our observations are now being prepared for publication.</p></div>			</div>
