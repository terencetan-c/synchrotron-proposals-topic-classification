<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The first aim of our experiments was to investigate how confinement in nanotubes affects the electronic structure of ionic liquids. Understanding the electronic structure of confined ionic liquids is key for applications such as supercapacitors, supported ionic liquid phase catalysis and lubrication.</p><p>In particular ionic liquids confined in nanotubes is a good model for in supercapacitors (whereby ions are confined in nanopores). The second aim of our experiments was to investigate the effects of a co-solvent (water) on the electronic structure of ionic liquids. The use of ionic liquid:molecular solvent mixtures is currently hindered by a lack of understanding of how a co-solvent affects the electronic structure of ionic liquids. Water is an especially important co-solvent, due to low cost and its presence as a common contaminant in ionic liquids (which are often highly hygroscopic).</p><p>NEXAFS spectra were collected for six ionic liquids at the S 1s edge and one ionic liquid at the Cl 1s edge (spectra were collected for both the neat and confined ionic liquids in all cases). Furthermore spectra for ionic liquid:water mixtures were recorded for three separate ionic liquids (two at the S 1s edge, one at the Cl 1s edge). Samples were deposited on a silicon wafer and mounted onto an 8-slot sample holder, allowing sample changes to be kept to a minimum. NEXAFS spectra were recorded in fluorescence detection mode with the samples under a helium atmosphere.</p><p>Confinement of ionic liquids in single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) led to narrower NEXAFS peaks, compared to neat ionic liquids, resulting from confinement restricting the number of possible ion environments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). However, the magnitude of confinement effects varied significantly between different ionic liquids. However, the magnitude of the confinement effect on electronic structure varied between ionic liquids.For example, confinement of</p><p>[N 2210 ][TfO] led to a shift in edge energy of &lt;0.1 eV, compared to +0.2eV for [C 2 C 0 Im][NTf 2 ] (the shift in edge energy is due to peak narrowing). For [C 4 C 1 Im][SCN] a shoulder appeared below the edge energy for confinement in SWNTs, but not for the wider grapite nanofibers (GNF). This result indicates the presence of wallsulfur interactions significantly altering the electronic structure of [C 4 C 1 Im][SCN] upon confinement (due to the width of GNFs only a small number of sulfur-wall interactions are possible, hence the lack of the pre-edge shoulder).</p><p>The effect of water on electronic structure of ionic liquids was found to be strongly dependent on the ionic liquid studied (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr Kevin Lovelock Imperial College London Mr Richard Fogarty* Imperial College London Dr Richard Bourne* University of Leeds Dr Thomas Chamberlain* University of Nottingham Mr Craig Stoppiello* University of Nottingham</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>For ([C 4 C 1 Im][SCN]) x (H 2 O) 1-x mixtures (x=mole fraction ionic liquid) only a small shift (+0.1 eV) was observed between x=0.0 and x=0.99. The small shift in edge energy for [C 4 C 1 Im][SCN] upon addition of water suggests the the sulufr does not form strong interactions with water molecules in ([C 4 C 1 Im][SCN]) x (H 2 O) 1-x mixtures. A peak narrowing was observed for [C 4 C 0 Im][HSO 4 ] (edge energy shifted +0.2 eV from x=0.0 and x=0.99) upon addition of water, likely as a result of anion-water hydrogen bond formation lowering the number of possible environments for sulfur.. In contrast, a significant increase in edge energy (up to +0.7 eV) was observed upon addition of water to [C 8 C 1 Im] Cl. Addition of water to [C 8 C 1 Im] Cl led to a stepchange in electronic structure between x=0.4 (1.5 Cl per water molecule) and x=0.5 (1 Cl -per water molecule); increasingly water concentration past 0.5 mole fraction made no further difference to the edge energy. The step change indicates that a strong specific (e.g hydrogen bonding) interaction between Cl -and water is responsible for the shift in energy (which is why the shift occurs when there is one H 2 O per Cl -).</figDesc></figure>
