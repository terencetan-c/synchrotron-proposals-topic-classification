<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The trivalent lanthanide elements are known to exhibit a common series of close-packed structures under pressure (hcp → Sm-type → dhcp → fcc), transforming to a distorted-fcc (dfcc) phase on further compression. The high-pressure structural behaviour of these elements is therefore often thought to be well known. However, structural assignment of the dfcc phase must be performed with care, as different distortedfcc structures can give very similar diffraction patterns. Evans et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> determined the dfcc phase of Pr to have a rhombohedral hR24 structure, but the monoclinic mC4 structure could only be ruled out due to the observation of a small number of very weak reflections. The same authors also reported Pr to undergo a transition to a second distorted-fcc structure, oI16, on further compression. The dfcc phases of the majority of the remaining trivalent lanthanides have been reported to have the same hR24 structure as in Pr, but these assignments have relied heavily on analogy with Pr. However, in addition to Pr, the transition to a second dfcc phase has only been observed in Nd <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Sm transforms to the dfcc phase above 20 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, but the structure has not yet been definatively determined, and instead it has been indexed as either trigonal (hP6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>,</p><p>or hP6 at lower pressures and monoclinic at higher pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>We were awarded 3 days on ID09a (experiment HC-805) to study the high presure structures of Sm, with the aim of making a comparison with neighbouring divalent Eu and trivalent Pr. Three Sm samples were compressed to a maximum pressure of ~55 GPa, and data were collected in 2-3 GPa steps in order to carefully pin down transition pressures.</p><p>In all our samples we observed the low-pressure phases in agreement with previous studies. However, although we observed mixed-phase dhcp/fcc patterns, we did not observe any single-phase fcc patterns on pressure increase, and instead the first dfcc pattern was collected at 18.7 GPa. The integrated diffraction profiles from the dfcc phase were extremely sharp, and we were able to resolve the splitting of the high-angle dfcc reflections even at the lowest pressure. The splitting of low-angle reflections could also be resolved at higher pressures. The hR24 structure gave an excellent fit to the dfcc patterns over the entire pressure range in which this phase was observed, and the reflections that rule out the mC4 structure were present in all patterns. In Pr, the subtle transition to the second dfcc phase was identified by the change in the relative intensity of the (006)/(202) and (0,0,12)/(404) reflections, which was identified as the disappearance of the (006) and (0,0,12)-hR24 reflections and the growth of new reflections from the oI16 phase with very similar d-spacings. The pressure-dependence of the (006)/(202) and (0,0,12)/(404) reflections in Sm is shown in insets (a) and (b) of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. It is clear from this figure that no new reflections appear with increasing pressure, and Sm thus remains in the hR24 phase for the entire pressure range.</p><p>On compression, the splitting of the fcc reflections increases with increasing pressure. Correspondingly, the c/a ratio increases continuously from 2.463(7) at 18.7 GPa, reaching a maximum value of 2.507(8) at 42.6 GPa, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. This is significantly larger than the maximum value of 2.487 reported for hR24-Pr by Evans et al.</p><p>On further compression, we observed a sluggish transition to the hP3 phase at ??? GPa, in agreement with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Sm remained in this phase up to 55 GPa, the highest pressure reached in this study.  The cross shows the maximum c/a ratio for hR24-Pr reported by Evans et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> In conclusion, we have determined the dfcc phase of Sm to have the same hR24 structure observed in Pr. However, Sm does not transform to a second dfcc phase such as the oI16 structure observed in Pr, and instead the hR24 structure distorts to a greater extent. On further compression, Sm transforms to the hP3 phase in agreement with previous studies. The differences in the high-pressure structural behaviour of Sm and Pr illustrate that it is not sufficient to perform structural assignment based on analogy with other members of the lanthanide series. These elements are known to be difficult for electronic structure calculations, and these subtle structural differences provide a challenge for future studies looking at the high-pressure behaviour across the lanthanide series.</p><p>Details of this work were presented at the joint SCCM/AIRAPT conference in July 2013. A manuscript has been submitted as conference proceedings and is currently under review.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): R.
