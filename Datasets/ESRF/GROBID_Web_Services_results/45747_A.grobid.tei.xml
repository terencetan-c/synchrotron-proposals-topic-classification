<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was devoted to a study of the crystal structure of the new high pressure ME 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 (ME = Ca, Y, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Tm, Yb) phases and thermal expansion of YbPtGe 2 germanide.</p><p>The powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ca 3 Pt 4+x Ge 13-y (161 reflections) was successfully indexed on the basis of a body-centered cubic unit cell with a lattice parameter of a = 18.0578(1) Å. Analysis of the extinction conditions showed seven possible space groups with diffraction symbols: m-3I---, m-3mI---and mmI4 1 --. As the first model for the refinement, the known structure of La 3 Rh 4 Sn 13 (space group I4 1 32, reflection conditions 00l, l = 4n) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was used. This refinement converged with reliability factors R I = 0.086, R P = 0.101 and interatomic distances, which were in good agreement with the sum of atomic radii of the elements. However, the calculated intensity of some reflections was substantially lower than the experimentally observed one (inset Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). No reasonabale structural model was found in the other six space groups with diffraction symbols mentioned above. The refinement succeeded successfully only in space group I2 1 3 as evidenced by low residuals (R I = 0.063, R P = 0.083) and reasonable interatomic distances.</p><p>The strongest peaks in the powder XRD pattern of the Yb 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 sample, measured on a HUBER G670 imaging plate Guinier camera, were indexed using a cubic primitive lattice with a cub = 9.0045 Å (some of them are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The presence of additional weak reflections indicated a doubling of the unit cell. Indeed, all reflections observed in the XRD pattern were indexed with lattice parameter a ≈ 2a cub = 18.0091 Å of a body-centered cubic lattice. However, some peaks in this pattern are either broadened or show pronounced asymmetry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). A clear splitting of the "broadened" and "asymmetrical" reflections is observed in high resolution (HR) synchrotron XRD experiment, thus indicating a tetragonal distortion of the lattice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). 122 peaks of the HR XRD pattern of Yb 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 were successfully indexed on the basis of a tetragonal primitive lattice with unit cell parameters a = 12.7479(1) Å, c = 9.0009(1) Å. The observed splitting pattern (e.g. (h00) reflections split into two with intensity ratio 2:1, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) as well as the characteristic ratio of the tetragonal lattice parameters (a tetr ≈ a cub √2, c tetr ≈ a cub ) corroborates a close relationship of the atomic arrangement to the cubic prototype. An analysis of the reflection conditions (l = 2n for (0kl); l = 2n for (00l)) in the HR XRD pattern of Yb 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 indicated 3 possible space groups: P4 2 /mcm, P4 2 mc and P-42c. The reasonable structural model was found only in the non-centrosymmetric space group P4 2 mc (R I = 0.061, R P = 0.117). Refined crystal structures of Ca 3 Pt 4+x Ge 13-y and Yb 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 allowed us to understand physical properties of these compounds, calculate their electronic structures and to explain some features of the chemical bonding in them. These results are published in Dalton Trans. 41 (2012) 6299-6309. All peaks in the room-temperature HR-XRD pattern of Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 were successfully indexed assuming a base-centered monoclinic space group (a = 12.8781(2) Å, b = 12.8384(2) Å, c = 9.1080(1) Å, β = 90.042(2)°, V = 1505.9(1)°A3). Analysis of the reflection conditions indicated possible space groups C2/c and Cc. However, the reasonable structural model was found only for space group Cc (R I = 0.057 and R P = 0.128) (crystal structure of Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 in space group C2/c is characterized by some disorder (two Ge atoms partially occupy their crystallographic sites) and by a strong shortening of some Ge-Ge contacts (up to 7%)). Experimental and calculated synchrotron XRD patterns as well as peaks belonging to the orthorhombic YPtGe 2 phase (structure type YIrGe 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, marked by asterisks) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Since no overlaps of these reflections with the peaks belonging to the studied Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 compound was observed, they were excluded from the refinement. One of the peaks with weak intensity, corresponding to a monoclinic distortion of the lattice cell of Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 and indicating the true choice of the symmetry (since it cannot be indexed in the orthorhombic space groups), is presented in the inset to Fig.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The same structural model was confirmed for this compound at 80 K. Structural data on Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 were used as input for band-structure calculations and helped in the understanding of superconductivity appearing at T C = 4.5 K in this high-pressure germanide. Obtained results are submitted as a regular paper to the Phys. Rev. B. (2013) All other compounds with 3-4-13 stoichiometry containing rare-earth metals RE 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 (RE = Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Tm) were shown to crystallize with the bace-centered monoclinic Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 type. The structural relationship between Pr 3 Rh 4 Sn 13 prototype [2], La 3 Rh 4 Sn 13 type as well as discovered in the present investigation cubic Ca 3 Pt 4+x Ge 13-y , monoclinic Y 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 and tetragonal Yb 3 Pt 4 Ge 13 types can be understood within the groupsubgroup scheme and will be described in a forthcoming publication. YbPtGe 2 is shown to crystallize with orthorombic YIrGe 2 type in the whole studied temperature range (20-300 K). Relative thermal expansion in all directions, which was deduced from the refinement of lattice parameters, is shown in Fig. 4. The change of lattice volume of YbPtGe 2 by 0.5% is typical for intermetallic compounds. However, as one can see from Fig. 4, this total thermal expansion is only due to the enlargement of the unit cell in the a and c directions. Unexpectedly, almost no expansion or even a small negative one is observed in the temperature range of 120-250 K along the b direction. A small negative volume thermal expansion is often observed for the Yb-based Kondo lattice or intermediate valence systems, but the present very anisotropic behavior is quite peculiar. These results are published in Phys. Rev. B 86 (2012) 235138.</figDesc></figure>
