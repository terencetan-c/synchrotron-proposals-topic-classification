<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Scope and experimental: Our aim was to confirm the formation of Ni(I) species and the dependence of the selfassembly process (described in the proposal) on the defective structure (Ti 3+ -OV) of titania photocatalysts. For this, we performed in situ XAS measurements in fluorescence mode 1 for different TiO2 photocatalysts, in aqueous suspensions in the presence of NiSO4, with or without UV illumination. We recorded HERFD XAS spectra at the Ni-K edge. We studied three relevant photocatalysts: (i) "White" TiO2, as received commercial anatase nanopowder; (ii) "Grey" TiO2, i.e., "white" TiO2 H2-treated at 500°C; and (iii) "Black" TiO2, i.e., "white" TiO2 H2-treated at 700°C. Darkening of TiO2 upon hydrogenation confirms the formation of defective Ti 3+ -OV structures in the oxide.</p><p>Results and discussion: We studied first the electrochemical reduction of a Ni(II) complex (Ni-cyclam) in an acetonitrile-based electrolyte, using an in situ XAS electrochemical cell. The XANES spectra at the Ni K-edge of the Ni-cyclam complex are shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. We measured the spectra of the complex under open circuit potential (OCP) conditions, as a reference for Ni(II). When polarizing the working electrode at -2 V (vs. Ag), a new structure appears at ca. 8337 eV, as indicated by the green arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. We attribute this feature to the formation of Ni(I) species in the electrolyte.</p><p>We then performed in situ XAS experiments studying the different photocatalysts in suspensions, in the presence of Ni(II) ions, in the dark and under UV light illumination (i.e., under photocatalytic H2 evolution conditions).</p><p>The XANES spectra of "grey" TiO2 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. In the dark, the spectrum resembles that of Ni(II) hydrated ions. Upon illumination, a new broad feature appears at ca. 8337 eV, and this is indicative of the formation of Ni(I). When the light is switched off, this structure decreases in intensity, thus confirming that the formation of Ni(I) is driven by illumination and is reversible. This correlates well with the high photocatalytic activity of "grey" TiO2, as we observed in our previous work. 2 The XANES spectra at the Ni K-edge of "white" TiO2 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. In the dark, the spectrum resembles that of Ni(II) hydrated ions, and, under illumination, no differences can be detected. The same is valid for this sample in the dark after illumination. We, in fact, found in our previous work that "white" TiO2 shows a negligible photocatalytic activity. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The XANES spectra at the Ni K-edge of "black" TiO2 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>. In the dark, the spectrum shows a spectral weight in the energy region of Ni(I), and this increases upon illumination. The original spectral shape is recovered after a long time in the dark (ca. 3 hours) after illumination. These conclusions are however made less straightforward by the fact that in the energy region characteristic of N(I), also Ni(0) has an increased spectral weight. The results seem to indicate that defective Ti 3+ -OV structures in "black" TiO2 are highly reactive and form Ni(I) species also in the dark. This process, however, seem to be not reversible, or rather slow. Hence, Ni(I) surface species are highly stabilized and cannot therefore significantly contribute to the H2 evolution reaction. Note that, in fact, "black" TiO2 shows a negligible photocatalytic activity, as found in our previous work. 2 Conclusions: In situ XAS results provided solid evidence that: -Ni(I) species, which form on "grey" TiO2 but not on "white" TiO2, catalyze photocatalytic H2 evolution (proton reduction) in the absence of a sacrificial agent and noble metal co-catalyst. -The formation of Ni(I) species is dependent on the presence in the TiO2 nanoparticles of surface Ti(III) sites, thus creating an artificial redox chain based on a monovalent nickel (Ni(I)) electron transfer relay. Thus, the formation of surface Ni(I) species is the rate determining step in the H2 evolution process. -Different H2 treatments (different temperatures) form defective Ti 3+ -OV structures in the oxide that have different density, distribution, and energy, 3 in line with recent in situ EPR studies. 4 -Defective Ti 3+ -OV structures in "black" TiO2 are highly reactive and form Ni(I) species also in the dark. This process, however, is not reversible, indicating that Ni(I) surface species are highly stabilized and cannot therefore contribute to the H2 evolution reaction. Our findings are important as we unequivocally demonstrate that using defective titania allows for the in-situ activation of a self-amplifying photocatalytic system that generates H2 from an aqueous Ni 2+ solution. No deposition of metallic Ni or other co-catalytic Ni-compounds could be detected. No hole scavengers are required. Rather, the in-situ activation process couples surface structural defects on TiO2 with the formation of single valent Ni(I) species that are able to rapidly reduce protons to H2. Self-amplifying reaction schemes as observed in this experiment may have a considerable potential for simple one pot synthesis and use of photocatalysts. We are currently preparing an article featuring the XAS data compiled in this report.</p><p>References:    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Marco Altomare,* University of Twente PCS, P.O.
