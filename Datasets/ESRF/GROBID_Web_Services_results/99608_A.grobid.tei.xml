<div><head>Report:</head><p>During our experiment we scanned the crania, mandibles, and postcranial elements of the Late Cretaceous Eutherian mammals. The scans were excuted at the resolution of 5.49, 0.73, and 0.35 um, and included imaging of whole objects as well as scanned sections of bones and teeth; in the latter performed at the enameldentine junction. Originally, 14 crania or skull fragments, 10 mandibles, and five postcranial skeleton fragments were scanned. After the scan reconstruction we obtained data for 10 crania, eight mandible fragments, and three postcranial bones, the remaining data were either not reconstructed or the scans crashed and the data were lost. We have no data from the scans performed at the highest (0.35 um) resolution, although seven teeth were scanned. We were informed that the data could not be reconstructed due to some error that occured during data acquisition (lack of some of the projection files). The scans performed at resolution of 0.73 um included 27 teeth (premolars, molars and incisors) and data were reconstructed with success, although some of them have strong ring-like artifacts. The planned research had multiple goals; we intended to reconstruct the intracranial morphology in Asioryctitheria and Zalambdalestidae, including brain and inner ear endocasts, turbinal morphology (if present) and dental exchange process. Furthermore, the scanning at the 0.73 and 0.35 um was planned to study the tissue incremental lines (in bones and teeth) for reconstructing the growth tempo and implications on the amimal's lifespan and possibly, on metabolic tempo in those organisms. Moreover, we planned a detailed study of the dentition, featuring the dental exchange and tooth formation in Cretaceous Eutheria. We obtained the reconstructed files in mid-July, 2022. In order to work with the data on our equipment at the <rs type="institution">Luo Lab (The University of Chicago, Il, USA</rs>) we needed to adjust the format and size of the scans.</p><p>The first task undertaken by our team was the study of dental replacement. We segmented the dentition in two specimens of juvenile eutherian genera (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which show the dental exchange in progress. Fig. 1. Dental exchange in progress in eutherian mammals: Kennalestes (A) and <rs type="funder">Barunlestes (B)</rs></p><p>This is the first ever visualization of the dental eruption in progress in Kennalestes and Barunlestes, showing a typical exchange pattern for placental mammals. This is a preliminary report, as we have not not able to process the data and publish our work in about seven months. However, the paper communicating our results is currently under preparation.</p></div>
