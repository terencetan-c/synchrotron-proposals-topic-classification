These concentrations were selected based on SQUID and Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements showing that: samples with x = 8% and x = 16% are ferromagnetic (after 700-900ºC annealing in vacuum ~1×10 -6 mbar) but no magnetic secondary phases could be identified; samples with x = 24% show a distinct ferromagnetic behavior and metallic α-Fe could be identified by Mossbauer spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>By combining these XAFS measurements with SR-XRD measurements at the BM20B beamline (ESRF), as well as STEM-EDX, SQUID magnetometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy, the observed ferromagnetism could finally be correlated with the presence of Fe-rich ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic secondary nanophases. The change in magnetic behavior upon air annealing could be correlated with the oxidation of metallic phases or the change in O-stoichiometry of already oxide phases. We are currently preparing two manuscripts associated with this experiment:</p><p>1. On the identification of fcc Fe (γ-Fe) nanoparticles (for x = 8% and x = 16%), a phase that is thermodynamically unstable in bulk. Even more remarkably, the magnetic coupling within the nanoparticles is ferromagnetic, whereas common γ-Fe nanoparticles/thin-films (typically embedded/grown on Cu) are antiferromagnetic. These findings inspire a completely new type of artifical multiferroics (cf. Outlook below). 2. On the remarkably reversible oxidation-reduction of Fe-oxides which are normally very stable (e.g. the reduction of embedded Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles into metallic Fe by annealing in moderate vacuum at only 900ºC). These unexpected effects can be attributed to the low oxygen chemical potential in the SrTiO 3 layer surrounding the embedded Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, resulting from the thermal annealing in vacuum which creates a significant concentration of oxygen vacancies (which in turn "absorb" oxigen atoms from the oxide nanoparticles).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comment on statistics:</head><p>Due to the low amount of Fe in the samples, the EXAFS data was of limited quality, with a usable maximum k value of only 10 Å -1 (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">1 left</ref>). Nevertheless, by complementing the EXAFS data with the also measured XANES data (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, right) and the other techniques mentioned above (STEM-EDX, SQUID and Mössbauer), we were able to achieve a convincing analysis and interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook:</head><p>As mentioned above in the context of manuscript 1 (in preparation), these findings open the way for studies on a completely new mechanism of strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling in artificial multiferroics. We are currently investigating these effects, including a new proposal for further EXAFS experiments at BM26A (to be submitted by the April 2015 call), on samples which are specifically designed to overcome the limitations mentioned above (cf.</p><p>Comment on statistics).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional (unforeseen) measurements:</head><p>Taking advantage of a beam time remainder of 5 hours, we measured four samples of a related material system: Feimplanted BiFeO 3 thin films (200 nm). Given the significantly larger amount of Fe in these samples, we were able to collect good-quality EXAFS data, confirming the formation of Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (also complemented by SR-XRD, SQUID magnetometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy). These measurements and analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) are included in a third manuscript (in preparation) associated with this experiment, dealing with the exchange-coupling between multiferroic BiFeO 3 (ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic) and the ferrimagnetic Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles.</p><p>7100 7120 7140 7160 7180 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 normalized (E) E (eV) S8 (vacuum) S11 (vacuum+air) S14 (vacuum+air+vacuum) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 |(R)| (Å -3</p><p>)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R (Å) -2 -1 0 1 2 k 2 (k) 2 4 6 8 10 k (Å -1 )</formula><p>Fig  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Fig. 1 -Selected data on Fe-implanted SrTiO 3 (samples S8, S11, and S14) showing the reversible oxidation-reduction mentioned above in the contex of manuscript 2.
