<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the experiment</head><p>The experiment aimed at studying charge density waves in nanometric Cr/MgO/Cr trilayers through high resolution X-ray diffraction.</p><p>Previous neutron diffraction experiments had shown the existence of two distinct magnetic regimes at low (T&lt;100K) or high temperatures (T&gt;200K) in these trilayers with, for each, peculiar magnetic signal signatures. While each layer of the trilayer experiences a different strain state, an anomalous increase of the expansivity of the top layer was observed in the transition temperature regime (100K-200K) with laboratory X-ray diffraction. To shed further light on this phenomenon, this experiment was focused on determining :</p><p>-the presence or absence of the charge density waves (CDW) satellites associated to the magnetic signatures observed with neutron diffraction.</p><p>-the location of the incommensurate CDW phases and the precise values of the CDW periods.</p><p>-the precise strain evolution with temperature for each layer.</p><p>The study of the CDW peaks evolution in our samples is extremely challenging since both high resolution and high flux were required as the intensity of the CDW peaks is four orders of magnitude smaller than Bragg peaks in bulk Cr, and even smaller in our trilayers. Moreover, the resolution had to be sufficient to enable the deconvolution of the Bragg peaks of the 2 layers and a precise measurement of the CDW peaks positions.</p><p>H (r.l.u.) L (r.l.u.) 1.96 1.98 2 2.02 2.04 2.02 2.03 2.01 2 1.99 1.98 1.97 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>The photon energy (12.3 keV) was chosen in order to have a facilitated access to the sought reciprocal space positions given the diffractometer configuration, and to optimize the beam flux. A LiF(440) crystal analyzer was used ; it was the best compromise to suit our samples mosaïcity (about 0.2° ) and the chosen energy. We used a displex cryocooler enabling the study of our samples on a wide temperature range (12K to 252K). These experimental conditions appeared to be very satisfactory and allowed running the experiment in very good conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>We were able to carry out exhaustive measurements of the CDW satellites and of the strain state of the layers for three different samples :</p><p>a reference sample constituted of a 80 nm thick Cr film on a MgO(001) substrate, capped with MgO.</p><p>a Cr/MgO/Cr trilayer, with a thin (3 monolayers) MgO barrier.</p><p>another Cr/MgO/Cr trilayer with a thick (10 monolayers) MgO barrier.</p><p>The measures were taken for temperatures from 12K to 252K, with temperature steps around 10K-15K.</p><p>For eachtemperatures and for all samples, we determined the precise positions of the 002, 004, 103, 204, 202 Bragg peaks for both Cr layers . This necessitated mesh scans for non azimuthal reciprocal space positions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These measurements enable to deduce the macroscopic residual strain in each layer, and to correlate it to the existing magnetic phases. Besides, scans around the 002 Bragg position in the L-direction (film normal) showed the expected weak CDW satellites at 002±2δ, of which position we were able to determine precisely. No visible evolution of their position was to be observed in the low temperature regime, while significant changes occurred above 180K (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Thanks to the good performance of the beam line , we were able to measure with very good precision the weak signal coming from the CDW and obtain an exhaustive study of its evolution with temperature and for different barrier thicknesses. These data, together with the structural properties we also measured during this experiment, will enable us to better understand the correlation of magnetism and strain states of thin films in our system. In summary the experiment was very successfull and the proposed experimental program has been satisfactorily fulfilled </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: reciprocal space map around the 2 0 2 Bragg position of Cr, for a Cr/MgO/Cr trilayer.
