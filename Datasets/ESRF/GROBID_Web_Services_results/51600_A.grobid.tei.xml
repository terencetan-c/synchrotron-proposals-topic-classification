<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this research is to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images of high performance composites commonly used in novel aircraft structures, such as bird strike resistant leading edges, and fuselage and engine protection for fragment impacts. Experiments were ultimately performed on both composite materials utilizing high tenacity fibres (e.g. Dyneema, containing polyethylene fibres), and carbon fibre materials containing advanced toughening phases to ameliorate impact damage. To date, results have been most fully analysised in relation to the carbon fibre-based systems, appearing in the following ISI journal publication (and summarised briefly below):</p></div>

Given that Mode I and Mode II dominated loading conditions have been identified to occur under low velocity impacts, modelling such Mode I and II fracture is a key first step in developing models for impact damage resistance and post-impact damage tolerance. The experiments documented here represent the first to capture in situ toughening mechanisms operating in Mode I interlaminar cracks in particle-toughened composite laminates, tested in both standard and non-standard geometries. They permit the direct identification of micro-mechanical features and mechanisms that affect the global Mode I fracture toughness. Mode II identification of micro-mechanisms was conducted ex situ, but the SRCL and SRCT techniques used still provided invaluable information without changing the stress state on the sectioning plane that may introduce out-of-plane displacements.</p><p>MATERIALS CFRP test coupons, provided by Cytec Engineered Materials, were manufactured from developmental particle-toughened material systems. The toughening was confined to a ∼30 µm thick particle-toughened interlayer in each system. The primary reinforcement was a proprietary intermediate modulus carbon fibre (∼5.4 µm in diameter).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The unique ability of SRCL to scan laterally extended objects proved invaluable in validating the observations made in the sub-sized specimen geometries commonly used for SRCT, and has indeed highlighted that in some materials and loading conditions the micro-mechanisms can be significantly different. Therefore, all work on narrow CFRP specimens should always be validated with standard engineering test geometries</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>were employed in the fracture toughness testing and SRCL imaging, which permits the use of laterally extended specimens that are closer to practical component and structural lengthscalesRESULTSFigure 1 Illustrates Mode I crack paths captured in toughened CFRP captured via SRCT &amp; SRCL showing; (a) a top down view of the crack showing a Mode I crack propagating on either side of the interlayer, (b) a side view of a representative slice featuring a fibre bridge and fibre/matrix 'peeling', (c) a region of an overlapping crack with fibre bridging and fibre/matrix interface failure, and (d) an SRCL slice identifying bridging and broken fibres in the crack wake.</figDesc></figure>
