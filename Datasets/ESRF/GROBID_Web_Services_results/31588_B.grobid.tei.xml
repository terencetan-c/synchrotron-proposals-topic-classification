<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Investigating the potential of high resolution K-edge digital subtraction angiography (KEDSA) for the detection of neurovascular pathology.</p><p>Experiment number: MD 156 Beamline: ID 17 Date of experiment: from: September 07 to: September 11, 2005 Date of report: October 15, 2005 Shifts: 12 Local contact(s): Dr. Christian Nemoz Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Kotoo Meguro*, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada Prof. Dean Chapman, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada Dr. Paul Crawford*, Royal Veterinary Hospital, London, U.K.</p><p>Prof. Francois Esteve, INSERM U647-ESRF, Grenoble, France Dr. Stefan Fiedler*, European Molecular Laboratory, Hamburg, Germany Dr. Michael Kelly, Stanford Medical Center, Stanford University, U.S.A. Dr. Christian Nemoz*, ESRF, Grenoble, France Dr. Lissa Ogieglo*, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada Dr. Michel Renier, ESRF, Grenoble, France Dr. Elisabeth Schultke*, Walton Medical Centre, University of Liverpool, U.K. and University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada Report: Previous work of the applicants, leading up to the MD 156 experiments: Using K-edge digital subtraction angiography, we were able to prove that it is possible to acquire angiographic images of the cerebral vasculature after intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent. These experiments were performed in a small animal model. (Schültke et al., Nuclear Inst. and Methods in Physics Research, A, 548 (1-2): 84-87, 2005)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective of the MD 156 experiments:</head><p>To test whether it would be possible, with the same technique, to acquire angiographic images of the cerebral vasculature also in a large animal model, in size comparable to human patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animal model used:</head><p>Adult male pigs (4).</p><p>The animals were kept under general anesthesia for the duration of the imaging sessions and were sacrificed at the end of the experiments. All animals yielded useful experimental results.</p><p>1. We established what could be seen if the contrast agent was injected directly into the carotid artery (comparable to digital subtraction angiography, a.k.a. DSA, the present 'gold standard' for the diagnostic of neurovascular disease with conventional, hospital-based equipment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: after injection of contrast agent into the aorta</head><p>Images of cerebral blood vessels in an adult pig, a.p. projections after injection of 5 ml XENETIX ® into the right carotid artery. Injection speed: 5 ml/sec. Only the right internal carotid artery (after the rete mirabile) is filled.</p><p>2. We used a central venous access for contrast administration, reasoning that the risk for neurological deficits is lower with central venous injection than with catheterisation of the arterial system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: after injection of contrast agent into the jugular vein</head><p>Images of cerebral blood vessels in an adult pig; a.p. projections after injection of 45 ml XENETIX ® into the right jugular vein. Injection speed: 15 ml / sec. Speed of vertical movement of the imaging chair through the beam was 40 mm / sec for image A and 180 mm / sec for image B. The thick skull bone causes more beam attenuation at the higher scanning speed, but the vascular structures can still be well identified.</p><p>3. Finally, we were testing whether we could acquire angiographic images of the cerebrum also after injection of contrast agent into a peripheral vein, which would carry the least risk.</p><p>A B Although the thick skull bone causes more beam attenuation at the higher scanning speed, the vascular structures can still be well identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vertical speed</head><p>(mm/sec)</p><p>Temporal resolution (sec) Duration of image (sec) 40 2.11 1.92 180 0.912 0.407 Table 1:</p><p>Correlation of vertical speed of the imaging stage moving through the beam, the resulting temporal resolution and the required duration to acquire one image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thus, we have reached the objective of the MD 156 experiments.</head><p>We have demonstrated that it is possible, in a model that is comparable in size to human patients, to acquire images of the cerebral vasculature after injection of contrast agent in a peripheral vein when synchrotron-based digital K-edge subtraction angiography is used. We have also shown that this can be done at radiation dose exposures that are acceptable for imaging in human patients. In fact, we have understood from these experiments that the acquisition of angiographic images is even more challenging in pigs than in human patients, because the ratio between brain size and thickness of the skull is much more favorable in humans than in pigs. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future directions:</head><p>1. Introduction of coils into the cerebrovascular system of two animals, to create an appropriate model of a human-sized patient after endovascular treatment. This will simulate the conditions encountered in our target population. 2. Testing the suitability of CT angiography in an animal model of electrocoiling. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: after injection of contrast agent into a peripheral vein (fore limb) Images of cerebral blood vessels in an adult pig; a.p. projections after injection of 45 ml XENETIX ® into a peripheral vein.Injection speed: 15 ml / sec.
