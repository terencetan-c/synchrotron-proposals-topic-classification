<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research goals</head><p>Within this proposal, we planned to study the crystal structure of ternary superconducting hydrides: La-Y-H, Mg-Y-H, Ca-Y-H. We expected that the crystal structure of these ternary polyhydrides will be determined for the first time. We planned to confirm formation of cubic CaYH12, LaYH12 and YxMg1-xH6, as well as non-stoichiometric ternary hydrides, in accordance with the results of computer modelling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Diamond anvil cells (DACs) loaded by (Mg,Y)-H and (Ca,Y)-H samples were broken during laser heating or a few days later, before its sending to ESRF. Four DACs loaded by LaxY(1-x)-H turned to be more stable and crashed only after the one day of XRD measurements at the ID15B beamline. Four measured DACs (named M1, M2, SL1 and SL3) had the following parameters:</p></div>

According to the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Xray diffraction and energy-dispersive analysis (EDX), the obtained alloys consisted of hcp-La4Y (SL1), hcp-La2Y (M2) and mixtures of La2Y+Y2La (M1) and La2Y+Y2La + Y (SL3).</p><p>Pulsed laser heating of La/Y micro samples, taken from obtained La/Y alloys and mixed with NH3BH3, was carried out at 1500-2000 K with duration of several microseconds. After the heating the La/Y particles expanded, became black, and the pressure in DACs, measured via both Raman signals of diamond and hydrogen, dropped to 180±2 GPa (M1, M2, SL1) and 170±2 GPa (SL3). Results of the synthesis were examined through powder X-ray diffraction of synchrotron radiation, wavelength of 0.4111 Å, at the ID15B ESRF beamline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In all 4 cells the main phase was Fm-3m-(La,Y)H10 with a cell volume by 0.5-0.83 Å 3 lower than the cell volume of Fm-3m-LaH10 at 170-180 GPa, respectively. This corresponds to the sample composition of La3YH40 or La0.75Y0.25H10, which is close to the loaded one (M2, SL1). The cleanest samples were in the DACs SL1 and M2, while in M1 and SL3 we have detected previously described impurities: pseudocubic Imm2-YH7 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, right chart) and, probably, Cmcm-LaH3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). *Taken from previous investigation of Y-H system.</p><p>Conclusion: within this project, we were able to synthesize a ternary fcc lanthanum-yttrium superhydride (decahydride) La3YH40, in which about 25% of La atoms were replaced by Y atoms without changing the cubic structure of the hydrogen sublattice. The latter explains the high-temperature superconductivity observed for the synthesized samples.</p><p>𝑭𝒎𝟑 ̅ 𝒎-(La,Y)H10 DAC Pressure, GPa a, Å V, Å 3 M1 180 5.038(1) 127.86(2) M2 180 5.026(1) 126.98(2) SL1 180 5.031(1) 127.32(1) SL3 170 5.071(1) 130.40(1) 𝑰𝒎𝒎𝟐-YH7 DAC Pressure, GPa a, Å b, Å c, Å V, Å 3 M1* 166 3.29(4) 3.33(6) 4.68(7) 51.50 SL3 170 3.303(1) 3.322(2) 4.672(2) 51.25(2) M1 180 3.279(2) 3.305(2) 4.641(2) 50.30(1) 𝑪𝒎𝒄𝒎-LaH3 DAC Pressure, GPa a, Å b, Å c, Å V, Å 3 M1 180 2.791(4) 10.492(5) 2.657(3) 77.83(2) SL3 170 2.737(2) 10.507(3) 2.727(2) 78.44(3)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
