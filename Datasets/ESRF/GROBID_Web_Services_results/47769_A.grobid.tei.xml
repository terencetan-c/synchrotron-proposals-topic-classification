<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the class of rare earth (RE) doped alkaline earth aluminates (SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu, (Dy) and CaAl 2 O 4 :Eu, (Nd)). These materials show persistent luminescence, meaning that they exhibit a considerable afterglow when the optical excitation has ended. Several theoretical models exist to explain the phenomenon of persistent luminescence, but the exact mechanism behind the storage and release of energy in these materials is still shrouded in mystery. Most models expect a valence state change of the rare earth dopants upon charging and subsequent slow decay [1]. XANES is in principle a perfectly suited technique to evaluate the valence state changes of these dopants [2].</p><p>In applications, the persistent luminescent materials are excited using light, but they can also be charged (and made to emit light for a long time) using x-rays; as such, the measurement beam during the XAS experiment simultaneously charges the material. The proposal aimed at a dedicated investigation on the valence state changes upon charging of the persistent phosphor by x-ray irradiation. Quick XANES measurements on the L III edges of the rare earth dopants would enable us to determine these changes. Unfortunately we were not able to perform the quick-XANES measurements, as they were requested in the proposal, due to the low dopant concentration and the strong absorbance of the host matrix.</p><p>CaAl 2 O 4 :Eu,(Nd) samples were prepared via non-aqueous sol-gel technique and a heat treatment in air at 1000째C. Subsequently these samples were annealed at different temperatures (500째C-1100째C) under H 2 /N 2 atmosphere to reduce Eu 3+ to Eu <ref type="bibr">2+</ref> . In this way a series with increasing Eu 2+ /Eu 3+ photoluminescent signal is obtained.</p><p>We were able to perform XAS measurements on the L III edge of Eu in CaAl2O4:Eu, (Nd) . The results are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. During the annealing, i.e. reduction process, the trivalent europium ions reduce to divalent europium. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> we can see that because of the reduction process, a shoulder appears on the lower half of the absorption edge. We performed a detailed investigation of the XANES spectra, whereby the white line of the divalent and trivalent Eu ions was fitted using arctangent and lorentzian functions. From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> it is clear that upon increasing the annealing temperature, a higher fraction of divalent Eu ions is present in the material.</p><p>The results depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> can be correlated with the photoluminescence (PL) of these samples: without anealing only line emission, arising from the trivalent ions is visible. By annealing the samples the band emission from the divalent Eu ions becomes more dominant in the PL spectra. This correlation is visualized in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2. Influence of the temperature during the post-annealing in H 2 /N 2 on the fraction of Eu 2+ emission with respect to the total emission intensity upon excitation at 260nm. All data points are plotted against the fraction of Eu 2+ as derived from the XANES measurements.</head><p>From Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> it is clear that there is a large difference between both valence states of europium derived from photoluminescence measurements and from the ratio derived from x-ray absorption spectroscopy. A considerable fraction of Eu 3+ ions can be present in the powders, although this is not necessarily reflected in the photoluminescent spectrum.</p><p>These results are part of a publication in Optical Materials Express [3]. The abstract for this publication is shown below:</p></div>

After heat treatment in air, the europium dopant ions are mainly in a trivalent state. For the reduction to the divalent state post-annealing in a reducing nitrogen-hydrogen atmosphere is used. The reduction of europium ions is monitored by photoluminescence and x-ray absorption (XANES) spectroscopy. The degree of reduction is strongly dependent on the annealing temperature. Although for high temperature a strong enhancement of the Eu 2+ emission is observed, this also leads to powders with a gray body color.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives</head><p>Unfortunately the time resolved measurements on persistent materials in fluorescence mode were not possible during this beamtime allocation. Although we realize that these measurements are very challenging, a dedicated investigation on the valence state changes upon charging of these phosphors by x-ray irradiation would enable us to discriminate between and fine tune different existing models for this phenomenon.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Received at ESRF:Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Dirk Poelman (proposer) Philippe F.
