<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Copper complexes have gained increasing interest as photosensitizers for photocatalytic water splitting, as they would be a cheaper alternative to the primarily used noble metal complexes. The redox potential of Cu + /Cu 2+ is already small and can be tuned by varyiing the geometry around the copper center as well as the electronic structure by modifying the ligand system. In particular, the inner coordination sphere is dominating these parameters. The so called entatic state is of great interest concerning this matter. With the copper complex already being closer to an excited state, the reorganisational barrier is lowered which could lead to enhanced electron transfer rates. This concept was subject to many studies already in bioinorganic and coordination chemistry. Applying ligand field theory to these states leads to a tetrahedron being favorable for d 10 Cu(I) and a square planar coordination for the d 9 Cu(II) systems. This also means that any geometry deviation from the ligand field limit facilitates an interconversion between the two oxidation states. It is thus important to experimentally access the electronic (d-electrons) as well as the geometrical (ligand coordination) structure around the copper site to gain insight into the working principle of such complexes. In the experiment CH-4958 we therefore conducted measurements on the Copper K-edge in addition to the iron hydride measurements. These were preliminary measurements in preparation of future studies as proof of principle. Furthermore these results were obtained using analyzer crystals acquired by our group.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The complex used for this preliminary study is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The two most important facts about this system are the angle between the CuNN planes, which are important in hindsight of the entatic state, as well as the 4 CH 3 groups which can be substituted to change the electronic structure of the complex (e.g. with halides).</p><p>The spectra in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> clearly show a very nice agreement between experiment and theory. It can clearly be seen that at least one prominent feature is diminished or enhanced when changing the geometry (red arrow). This means that the ligand coordination around the central atom as well as the electronic structure (by looking at the orbitals from the calculations) can be extracted from the HERFD-XANES spectra. These are still preliminary results but they show that future studies with HERFD-XANES and vtc-XES can give tremendous insight into the structural change upon photooxidation and the influence of the ligands on this matter.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2: Experimental (black) and two theoretical HERFD-XANES spectra. The red spectrum was calculated using the crystal structure of the Cu(I) complex with an angle of 80° between the two CuNN planes.
