<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the beamtime we have investigated two sets of samples, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) functionalized by palladium and supported alloyed PdZn nanoparticles, during the reaction of catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. The results for the latter samples was recently submitted (Ahoba-Sam, et al. Catal. Sci. Technol. Under Review), the abstract is shown below. For the MOF-based samples, all experimental data from the beamtime is analyzed and some additional laboratory work is required to complete the manuscript. The results obtained for this sample are summarized below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract of the submitted manuscript:</head><p>A challenge in converting CO 2 into hydrocarbons (HC) via methanol <ref type="bibr">(MeOH)</ref> is the gap between the optimal temperature for each step (i.e. ‚â§ 250 ¬∞C for MeOH and ‚â•350 ¬∞C for HC). The focus of this study is to elucidate the cause of the limitations associated to oxygenate and hydrocarbon formation in combined PdZn and H-ZSM-5 catalysts at 250 to 350 ¬∞C. Starting with two different chemical states of Pd and Zn from two preparation approaches (physical mixture and surface organometallic chemistry grafting), operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies revealed similar PdZn alloy active phase formed during pretreatment in flowing H 2 /Inert at 400 ÔÇ∞C. The physical mixture performed better than the grafted analogue, with up to 8.8 % yield to oxygenate (MeOH and dimethyl ether (DME)) at 300 ¬∞C, close to the estimated thermodynamic yield (9.0%). The space-time yield (STY) of oxygenates (MeOH and DME; MeOH+) increased from 250 to 300 ÔÇ∞C, reaching 8.5 mol (MeOH+) /kg (PdZn) .h ). The catalyst performance surpassed other reported yields in similar systems, which activity declined with temperature even below 300 ÔÇ∞C. Operando XAS and XRD experiments further showed that the PdZn phase active for MeOH formation was maintained during testing in the 250-350 ÔÇ∞C range. InfraRed (FT-IR) and XAS experiments revealed the poisoning of Br√∏nsted acid sites in H-ZSM-5 by Zn(II) exchange, thereby rendering it inactive for hydrocarbon formation. Overall, to avoid biasing the hybrid catalyst performance, a careful and balanced choice of the compositional characteristics will be crucial in designing an improved multi-functional catalytic system for CO 2 valorisation 1. Description of the experimental procedure and data analysis.</p><p>XRPD and Pd K-edge XAS data were collected at the BM31 of the ESRF (Grenoble, France). The sample (ca. 10 mg) was loaded inside a 2.5 mm quartz glass capillary and fixed with quartz wool from both sides. A capillary was glued inside the sample holder connected to a remotely controlled gas line (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S1</ref>). A gas blower was positioned below the sample to control the temperature. The samples were activated in situ by heating in a flow of 1.4 mL/min H 2 and 8.6 mL/min He from room temperature to 300 ¬∞C and left at this temperature for 30 min to allow the formation of nanoparticles. Then, the flow was switched to pure He to remove possible PdH x phase. The activated material was cooled down to 240 ¬∞C, and exposed to a reaction mixture (7.5, 2.5, and 10 mL/min of H 2 , CO 2 , and He, respectively). The reaction was run at 240, 200, and 170 ¬∞C under total pressure of 1 and 8 bar, for 2 h under each of the above conditions. The resulting gas mixture after the sample was analyzed by online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer OmniStar GSD 320). Pd K-edge XAS were obtained in the transmission mode by continuous scanning of the double crystal Si(111) monochromator from 24.1 to 25.3 keV for steady state spectra and during reaction, and from 24.2 to 24.8 keV for measurements during activation. To reduce higher harmonics the monochromator was detuned to 80% of the maximal intensity. Palladium foil was measured simultaneously with each spectrum for energy calibration using a third ionization chamber. XRPD was measured using 0.51067 √Ö radiation, selected by a Si(111) channel-cut monochromator. CMOS-Dexela 2D detector covered the 2Œ∏ region up to 35 ¬∞. The values of the photon wavelength, sample to detector distance and detectors tilts have been optimized by Rietveld refinement of NIST LaB 6 and Si samples and kept fixed in the refinement of the Pd/C samples. For better statistics 20 diffraction images and 20 dark images (without X-ray beam) with acquisition time of 5 second were collected at each experimental point. Demeter software package <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> was used to process and analyze EXAFS spectra. Background subtraction, normalization and energy calibration were performed in Athena program using standard parameters. The first shell Fourier analysis of the EXAFS data was performed in Artemis program using Pd-Pd contribution with four variable parameters: ŒîE 0 , R Pd-Pd , œÉ 2 Pd-Pd , N Pd-Pd . The fit was performed in R-space in 1.0 -3.0 √Ö region for k 2 -weighted data Fourier transformed in 3.0 -10.0 √Ö -1 Œîk region (2ŒîkŒîR/œÄ &gt; 8). The ùëÜ 0 2 value was fixed at 0.77 as determined for Pd foil. Analysis of experimental XANES spectra was performed using multivariate curve resolution (MCR) approach implemented in pyMCR 0.3.1 library. The whole dataset of normalized experimental spectra was represented by matrix D of size m √ó n, where m is the number of spectra and n is the number of energy points. This matrix is decomposed as D = CS T + E, where C with size m √ó k is the concentration profiles of k pure components from matrix S (n √ó k), and E (m √ó n) is the error matrix. The energy ranges were limited to 24.33 -24.41 keV. The optimal number of components was found from the principle component analysis (PCA) implemented in PyFitIt code. Theoretical XANES spectra were calculated within a full potential finite difference method of FDMNES code. The computational sphere radius was chosen as 5.2 √Ö. The surfaces were represented by unit cell with 32 Pd atoms, adsorbed species (CO 2 , CO, CH 3 , H 2 O, O and OH placed on top, bridge or hollow sites) and 13 √Ö of vacuum (See Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). All geometries were initially optimized in VASP 5.3 code with PBE exchange-correlation potential using a 8—Ö4—Ö1 Monkhorst Pack grid with the plane-wave basis cutoff at 500 eV.</p><p>2D XRPD images were averaged in PyFAI code <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> to obtain I(2Œ∏) patterns. Whole-pattern fitting by Pawley method was performed in Jana2006 code <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The used 2Œ∏-range was from 3 to 30¬∞. The initial structure was based on cubic cell of UiO-67 in Fm-3m symmetry with cell parameter a = 26.8 √Ö. The variable parameters included cell parameter (a), three parameters of Pseudo-Voight function and ten parameters of the background function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminary conclusions.</head><p>XAS and XRD data collected simultaneously under reaction condition provide significant insight on the structure of the catalyst during catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. EXAFS shows the increased interatomic distances (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) in palladium nanoparticles compared to metallic palladium which correlates with temperature changes and the partial hydrogen pressure indicating the formation of palladium hydride phase. At the same time XANES features (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) can be reproduced by considering CO adsorption on palladium particles, as one of the reaction intermediates. Finally, XRD shows that the MOF lattice is also dynamic during the reaction (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which can be explained by diffusion of the reagents inside the pores of MOF.    </p></div>
