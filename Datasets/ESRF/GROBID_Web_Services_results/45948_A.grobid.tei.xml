<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The discovery of superconductivity at 11.5 K in CaC 6 , a graphite intercalation compound, has motivated a wealth of research into understanding the superconducting mechanism in this material. Another electronic ground state which manifests within this system is that of a charge density wave (CDW) as evidenced by recent STM and STS data. The co-existence of charge ordering and superconductivity within graphitic materials strengthens the already existing analogy with layered high-T c materials. In order to further characterise the CDW state in CaC 6 we intended to utilise single-crystal x-ray diffraction to observe the charge superlattice and compare its periodicity with that of STM data. Additionally we aimed to measure the temperature dependence of the CDW peaks and the CaC 6 lattice parameters.</p><p>CaC 6 samples were grown via a molten alloy method at University College London. The samples were characterised using in-house x-ray diffraction and transported to the ESRF in an argon atmosphere to inhibit oxidation. The samples were loaded onto copper stubs, specific for transmission geometry: oxidation was prevented via the use of kapton and mylar shrouds. This eliminated the problem of scattering from a beryllium dome which had obfuscated images in previous experiments. A cryofurnace was used to enable access to a wide temperature range (from ~10K up to ~800K where the samples are expected to decompose).</p><p>We have made the first measurement of the temperature dependent, in-plane scattering from CaC 6 . Detailed diffraction images were taken using a MAR CCD camera around the (100), ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) Bragg peaks. These images demonstrated the presence of satellites surrounding the Bragg peaks which are not expected from the ideal CaC 6 structure and are approximately 100 times weaker in intensity than the primary peaks. The position of these peaks can not yet be explained from the periodicity of the charge ordering observed via STM.</p><p>Images of these peaks were taken over a wide temperature range from 10K up to 800K; interestingly the satellite peaks are present at all temperatures measured.</p><p>Monitoring the lattice parameters over such a wide temperature range was performed to search for a structural transition indicative of a CDW condensation. However, no such transition was found: instead only a slight decrease in the in-plane lattice parameter was observed as the temperature was raised as is expected for most GICs. The presence of additional peaks accompanying the Bragg peaks and their persistence at high temperatures raises many questions about their physical origin. In the family of graphite intercalation compounds both CaC 6 and YbC 6 have been shown to exhibit satellite peaks at (1 1.2 0), (1.2 1 0) and (1.2 1.2 0) without explanation. In future work we intend to extend the xray diffraction study to other divalent GICs. Whilst SrC 6 has a critical temperature of 1.65 K, no superconductivity has been observed in BaC 6 down to temperatures of 80 mK. Furthering the investigation to these other GICs will allow us to determine whether the presence and intensity of these peaks correlates with superconductivity or the magnitude of T c .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
