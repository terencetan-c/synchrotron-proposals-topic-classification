Surprisingly recent muon spin rotation analysis on these samples reveals the occurrence of</p></div>

According to theoretical investigation the crystal structure must be orthorhombic at low temperature to accommodate the magnetic ordering and hence also in these sample a symmetry breaking is like ly to occur. The aim of the experiment was thus to characterize a series of Sm(Fe 1-x Ru x )As(O 0.85 F 0.15 ) samples (x up to 0.6) in order to establish with accuracy the dependence of the tetragonal -to-orthorhombic transition as function of Ru content. The experiment was carried out at the ID31 beamline and patterns were collected for 5 samples with nominal composition Sm(Fe 1-x Ru x )As(O 0.85 F 0.15 ) (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) between 10 and 300 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Structural refinements using data collected below 150 K were carried out applying both tetragonal and orthorhombic structural models. By comparing the corresponding weighted χ 2 values, it is was possible to ascertain the most likely polymorph.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the comparison of the synchrotron powder diffraction data collected at 10 K on the x = 0.05 sample fitted with the P4/nmm and Cmme structural models; the tetragonal model overestimates the intensities of the peaks at ∼ 7.3° and ∼ 7.7° 2θ, whereas the orthorhombic foresees the correct value.</p><p>The micro-structure of the samples was analyzed by using the anisotropic strain parameters obtained after Rietveld refinement and analyzing the broadening of diffraction lines by means of the Williamson-Hall plot method. Samples with x = 0.30 display a similar behavior: on cooling the evolution of the lattice micro-strain along h00 and 00l is almost coincident, whereas that along hh0 departs from them on cooling. By combining the present data with those obtained from previous muon spin rotation analysis, a possible phase diagram of the Sm(Fe 1-x Ru x )As(O 0.85 F 0.15 ) system was drawn.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Rietveld refinement plot obtained fitting the SPD data collected at 10 K on the Sm(Fe 0.95 Ru 0.05 )As(O 0.85 F 0.15 ) sample with an orthorhombic structural model; tick marks indicate the position of the Bragg peaks (including those of SmOF), the points are observed data, while the solid line is the calculated profile; a difference curve (observed minus calculated) is plotted at the bottom.
