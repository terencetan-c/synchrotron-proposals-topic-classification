<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal was to determine the impact of the size of the confinement on the ions distribution profiles at the planar parallel SiO 2 surfaces spaced of 2, 4 and 6 nm (nanochannels) in electrolyte solutions containing ions having more or less kosmotrope character using hard X-ray reflectivity. The electron density profiles obtained in such model systems will be compared to the one obtained by the atomistic modelling of these silica-based nanoconfinements filled with solutions in order to obtain the ions distribution and the charge surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</head><p>We have characterized the X-ray reflectivity of silica nanoconfinements (Ph.D of M. Baum between ICSM and CEA-MEM) Erreur ! Source du renvoi introuvable. filled of water and ions. We used a silicabased model system consisting in two parallel and plane surfaces spaced of 2, 4 and 6 nm (nanochannels) made by the CEA-LETI.</p><p>Samples will be first measured under vaccum at 200 Â°C in an oven and secondly, immersed in electrolyte solutions XCl 2 (with X = Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Ba 2+ ) at 0.2 and 1 M. Then, nanochannels will be placed in the previously used experimental set-up dedicated to the X-ray reflectivity measurement of samples in solution. X-ray reflectivity characterizations will be performed at 27 keV to allow transmission through the width of the sample (5 mm). All data will be recorded at 1 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm from the entrance of the nanochannels in order to determine an effect of the solution transport. An example of data collected on samples of 2, 4 and 6 nm are presented on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 I/I0 q (A -1 ) IQ4Empty1mm IQ4Empty5mm IQ4Empty10mm IQ41M1mm IQ41M5mm IQ41M10mm 6nm 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 4 nm I/I0 q (A -1 ) IQ4Empty1mm IQ4Empty5mm IQ4Empty10mm IQ41M1mm IQ41M5mm IQ41M10mm 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 10 -10 10 -9 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6</p><p>2 nm</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I/I0 q (A -1 ) IQ4Empty1mm IQ4Empty5mm IQ4Empty10mm IQ41M1mm IQ41M5mm IQ41M10mm</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: X-ray reflectivity data obtained on samples of 2, 4 and 6 nm in BaCl 2 solution at 1M.</p><p>Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.):</p><p>All the data were collected perfectly. However, the nanochannels having a 2 nm and 4 nm size were not completely filled after 1 month.

The second goal is to test the effect of pH on the ions distribution at the interface of silica in 2 and 4 nm nanochannels.</p><p>Publication(s): -Baum, M. et al.
