<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The hetero-dimeric nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) binds to 5' capped polymerase II transcripts. It enhances the efficiency of several mRNA maturation steps and is essential for U snRNA nuclear export in multicellular eukaryotes. The complex comprises a large subunit CBP80 and small subunit CPB20. The crystal structure of human CBC was determined by Se-Met MAD using data to 3Å resolution measured on FIP (BM30) from which SHELXD found 57/57 selenium sites. (Selenium incorporation was done CBP80 expressed in insect cells). Phases were transferred to native data measured to 2Å resolution on EH2 and phase extension performed using 3-fold NCS. The final map could largely be built into automatically by WarpNtrace. The structure shows that the large subunit, CBP80, comprises three domains each containing consecutive helical hairpins and resembling the so-called MIF4G domain found in several other proteins involved in RNA metabolism. The small subunit, CPB20, has an RNP fold and associates with the second and third domains of CBP80. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed four residues of CBP20 which are critical for cap binding. A model for cap binding is proposed based on these results and the known mode of binding of RNA to RNP domains. Publication. Crystal structure of the human nuclear cap-binding complex.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>shows that a stable complex could be formed even before the rest of the SRP RNA is transcribed. From a second structure, with an 88 nucleotide RNA, a model for the full Alu-domain consistent with extensive biochemical data is deduced. A novel feature is the idea that there could be a reversible switch in the folding of the Alu-domain which might be of functional importance in the mechanism of elongation arrest. The Aludomain structure is likely to be conserved in other small cytoplasmic RNPs and retroposition intermediates that contain SRP9/14 bound to RNAs transcribed from Alu or Alu-derived elements in genomic DNA.

We have determined at 1.8Å resolution the crystal structure of human SRP19 in complex with its primary binding site on helix 6 of SRP RNA which consists of a stem-loop structure closed by an unusual GGAG tetraloop. The structure solution was done by MAD on bromine uridine-substituted RNA using data from ID29. Protein-RNA interactions are mediated by the specific recognition of a widened major groove and the tetraloop without any direct protein-base contacts, and include a complex network of highly ordered water molecules. A model of the assembly of the SRP core comprising SRP19, SRP54 and SRP RNA based on crystallographic and biochemical data is proposed. Publication: Wild, K., Sinning, I. and Cusack, S.

Heidelberg).</p><p>(3) T. thermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase complexed with tRNAtyr(GUA).</p><p>Bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases (TyrRS), unlike those of archae and eukaryotes, possess a flexibly linked C-terminal domain of about 80 residues which has hitherto been disordered in crystal structures of the enzyme. Prokaryotic tRNA tyr has a long variable arm which distinguishes it from all tRNAs except tRNA ser and tRNA leu . We have determined the structure of Thermus thermophilus TyrRS at 2.0Å resolution in a new P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal form in which the C-terminal domain is ordered and find that the fold is very similar to the Cterminal domain of ribosomal protein S4. Several crystal forms of the complex of T. thermophilus TyrRS and tRNA tyr have been characterised, the best being a trigonal form diffracting to 2.8Å resolution. In this structure the C-terminal domain is observed to bind to the long anti-codon stem and long variable arm of the tRNA. The orientation of the long variable is of tRNA tyr is distinct to that of tRNA ser (which helps the respective synthetases distinguish between the two) and this can now be understood in terms of the respective core structures of the tRNAs. Specific recognition of Gua-34 and Uri-35 anti-codon bases is observed. Furthermore the tRNA tyr binds across the two subunits of the dimeric enzyme and remarkably the mode of recognition of the class I TyrRS for its cognate tRNA resembles that of a class II synthetase in being from the major groove side of the acceptor stem. Publication: Class I tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase has a class II mode of cognate tRNA recognition. Yaremchuk, A., Kriklivyi, I., Tukalo, M. and Cusack, S. (submitted).</p><p>(4) Structure of the fibre head of adenovirus strain Ad3.</p><p>Adenoviruses of serotype Ad3 (subgenus B) use a still unknown host cell receptor for viral attachment whereas viruses from all other known subgenera use the Coxsackie and Adenovirus receptor (CAR). The receptor binding domain (head) of Ad3 fibre protein has been expressed in Echerichia coli inclusion bodies. After denaturation and renaturation using a rapid dilution method, crystals of trimeric head were obtained. The 1.6 Å resolution X-ray structure shows a strict conservation of the beta-sheet scaffold of the protein very similar to the head structures of the CAR-binding serotypes Ad2, Ad5 and Ad12. The conformation of the loops is different, with the exception of the AB loop which forms the centre of the interface in the Ad12-CAR complex structure. The structure explains why a mutation in Ad5 of one residue in the AB loop to glutamic acid, as in Ad3, abrogates binding to CAR. It is possible that the Ad3 receptor binding site is nevertheless similarly situated to the CAR binding site. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement using data collected at beam lines ID14-1. (5) Leucyl-tRNA synthetase.</p><p>Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) is a large monomeric class I synthetase closely related with IleRS and ValRS. Each contains a homologous insertion domain of ~ 200 residues, which is thought to permit them to hydrolyse ('edit') cognate tRNA that has been mischarged with a chemically similar but non-cognate amino acid. We have found that Thermus thermophilus leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRSTT) is capable of editing homocysteine, norleucine and norvaline, the latter activity occurs in tRNA-dependent manner. We have previously determined the crystal structure of LeuRSTT in complex with leucine and a leucyl-adenylate analogue at 2Ǻ resolution giving the first view of this enzyme and its architectural similarities and differences from IleRS as well as a detailed picture of the leucine binding site and editing domain. Very recently we have determined structures of LeuRSTT at 2Ǻ resolution, with AMP bound in the editing site (data from ID14-EH2 data) and with a norvalyl-adenylate analogue bound in both the synthetic and editing sites (ID14-EH1 data). These structures show for the first time how a non-cognate amino acyl-adenylate is bound in the editing site and suggest a mechanism for pre-transfer editing althpugh leave open the question of how the adenylate translocates between the two active sites, 33Ǻ apart. The structure is also very consistent with rectn biochemical results which implicate Thr-252 in the editing site in permitting the non-cognate norvaline to bind but excluding the cognate leucine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manuscript in preparation.</head><p>(6) Human hnRNP K.</p><p>HnRNP K is a multifunctional, multi-domain RNA/DNA-binding and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. Specific functions have been found as a cytoplasmic translational repressor (by binding to CU-rich RNA sequences in the 3' UTR of certain mRNAs) and as a nuclear transcription factor e.g. for c-myc (by binding to CT-rich DNA sequences). Nuclear acid binding ability is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation by c-SRC kinase. The protein has three K-homology (KH) domains which bind nucleic acid (usually RNA). Our aim is to make complexes of domains of hnRNP K with interacting partners (nucleic acid or SH3 domains). We have solved the structure of the third KH domain (domain of 86 residues) at 0.9Å resolution, measured on ID14-EH2 by molecular replacement using a previously published NMR structure. Refinement is in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Publication: Structure of the adenovirus fibre receptor domain of Ad3, a non CAR-binding serotype Durmort, C., Mitraki, A., Stehlin, C., Schoehn, G., Drouet, E., Cusack, C. &amp; Burmeister, W.
