<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale:</head><p>The results obtained with MD571 beamtime suggested that a disconnection between the dentate gyrus and the amon horn of the hippocampus was not sufficient to prevent seizures. It was therefore unlikely that transections of the dentate gyrus would be effective to stop seizures, as suggested by this proposal. Instead, we decided to perform a longitudinal EEG follow up in kainate mice before and after seamless irradiation in the dorsal hippocampus (100Gy).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>-Timeline</p><p>Note: EEG electrodes were custom-made carbon electrodes (MRI and MRT compatible).</p><p>-Experimental groups:</p><p>Irradiated kainate mice 100Gy n=8 Control kainate mice 0Gy n=3</p><p>Results:</p><p>-Irradiation:</p><p>-The posterio-ventral hippocampus (which did not receive the kainate injection) was not irradiated.</p><p>-1 month post-irradiation T1-gado MRI 0Gy 100Gy</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hypersignals are related to gadolinium diffusion through vessel microruptures due to irradiation. There's a clear hypersignal in the right hipppocampus of mice irradiated with 100Gy. Carbon electrodes are visible in the hippocampi.</p><p>-EEG -Histology: Being performed (Nissl).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>-Once again, only some of the animals (2 out of 8) irradiated at 100Gy display a disappearence of seizures after treatment. It seems to be an all-or-nothing mechanism. -Does it depend on the location of the irradiation. Histology will tell us that.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Jean Laissue* -Institute of Pathology Bern Antoine Depaulis* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Elke Brauer-Krisch* -ESRF Raphael Serduc* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Benoit Pouyatos* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 François Estève -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Report:</figDesc></figure>
