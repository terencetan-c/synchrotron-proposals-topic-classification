<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we aimed to study the mechanical properties of single ZnO nanowires by in situ Laue microdiffraction during three-point bending tests using a custom-built AFM. Due to the size effect, it is expected for the nanowires to approach the limits of the yield strengths which allows for large elastic deformations.</p><p>ZnO nanowires with a diameter of 200 nm and a length of up to 10 µm were grown by hydrothermal growth method. The ZnO nanowires were detached from their growth substrate by ultrasonication that lead to a breaking of the nanowires into sections of 3 to 4 µm in length. The nanowires were then dispersed on a silicon substrate with 2 µm wide trenches. Some of the nanowires crossed the micro-trenches resulting in self-suspended nanowires that were thoroughly fixed by electron beam induced deposition of Pt at the nanowire ends (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>). For in situ three-point bending tests in combination with Laue microdiffraction, the custom-built AFM "SFINX" was installed on the sample stage at the BM32 beamline. The incident polychromatic X-ray beam was focused down to 300 nm x 500 nm using a pair of Kirckpatrick-Baez mirrors. The nanowires were located by measuring the Zn-Kand Pt-K fluorescence yield as illustrated by the fluorescence maps displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref> showing the same nanowire as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. Laue microdiffraction patterns were recorded in-situ while bending the nanowire. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> presents a mosaic of the displacement of the ZnO (0 2 2 0) Laue spot during the application of a force on the nanowire. The Laue spot displacement on the detector indicates a rotation of the crystalline lattice by bending and/or torsion of the nanowire. Besides the displacement of the spot, it also enlarges, in particular, in the vertical but also in the horizontal direction as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, indicating the local deformation of the ZnO crystal. Fig. 3: Enlargement of the ZnO (0 2 0) Laue spot size during the bending test in reference to the original size</p><p>The ZnO nanowire microdiffraction patterns were indexed using the LaueTools software providing the UB orientation matrices. The rotation of the crystal was calculated with help of these matrices. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the rotation angle as a function of the measurement steps during loading and unloading of the nanowire with the AFM tip for the three orthogonal lattice planes (0 0 0 1), (0 1 1 0) and the (2 1 1 0). The rotation of the (0 1 1 0) and the (0 0 0 1) crystal planes indicate a bending of the nanowire. The additional rotation of the (2 1 1 0) crystal plane, however, shows a more complex behavior, which may indicate either a torsion or a non-vertical bending due to a non-vertical force application. During this beamtime, we tested 10 ZnO nanowires by in situ three-point bending up to their fracture as illustrated by the SEM images taken before and after the experiment. The data is currently under analysis. -Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.): This in-situ Laue microdiffraction experiment during the three-point bending of single suspended ZnO nanowires focused on the mechanical behavior of the nanowires such as elasticity, plasticity, and fracture toughness. While this beamtime focused on ZnO nanowires with a diameter of ~200 nm, future experiments will focus on thinner nanowires to study the fracture toughness. -Publication(s): S. Saïdi, M. Texier, S.
