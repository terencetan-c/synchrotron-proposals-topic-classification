<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tubulin is a 100 kDa heterodimer that aligns head-to-tail along the protofilaments in the wall of microtubules. Microtubules are major components of the cytoskeleton in eucaryotic cells where they play various and essential roles in cell division and intercellular traffic. SCG10 is a neuron-specific protein, membrane associated and concentrated in growth cones. It binds to microtubules and induces their disassembly. We have shown the existence of a stable complex between a soluble fragment of SCG10 and two dimers of tubulin. Crystals were obtained and diffracted up to 6 Å resolution with cell parameters : P212121, a=56, b= 353, c= 466Å (D. <ref type="bibr">Fleury &amp; al., JSB, 2000, 131,156-158)</ref> We have recently obtained crystals of a complex between a shorter fragment of SCG10 (90 aminoacids instead of 131). The crystals, tested on ID14EH1, diffracted weakly up to 10 Å and the diffraction pattern showed smaller cell parameters, estimated to 220x220x45 Å.</p><p>Improvement of the crystallization is in progress.</p><p>Kinesin is a microtubule associated motor protein and plays many essential roles within eucaryotic cell. Crystals of two kinesins from Drosophila were tested. They diffracted weakly. Crystallization is in progress.</p></div>

Two data collection at 1.97 &amp; 2.4 Å were collected from a crystal of VIM-2 co-crystallised and soaked with Rthiomandelic acid and also two other data sets were collected from a crystal of VIM-2 co-crystallised and soaked with S-thiomandelic acid at the same resolution. All were flash-frozen in the cryostream after soaking in 15% glycerol.
