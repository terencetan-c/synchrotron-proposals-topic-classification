<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>During the last decade, ALD has emerged as an effective method to deposit noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) with a precise control of the particle morphology (size and areal density), which has promising potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis (Pt, Pd) and plasmonics (Au, Ag). Here, our home built ALD system enabling in situ monitoring of the NP morphology and loading by GISAXS and XRF measurements has been exploited to study the NP nucleation and formation during ALD growth of Au. In collaboration with Prof. S. Barry at Carleton University, we recently developed a PE-ALD process for the deposition of metallic Au, using Me3Au(PMe3) as the precursor in combination with H2 plasma as the reactant. The goal of this synchrotron campaign was to get a better understanding of the island growth mode during this new ALD process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>GISAXS patterns were recorded using the Pilatus 1M detector of the beamline, using an acquisition time of 30s. The Xray energy was set to 11.98 kev. The distance between sample and detector was 3.9 m, while the incident angle was 0.5°. XRF spectra were simultaneously recorded using a Vortex detector. Au NPs were deposited on SiO2 (LPCVD oxide and thermal oxide) and Si (HF dipped) substrates at 110°C by alternating exposure to Me3Au(PMe3) as precursor and H2 plasma as reactant. Argon is used as the carrier gas for the precursor. Low pressure (6x10 -3 mbar) pulses were employed for the precursor exposures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ study of Au NPs on three different silicon substrates</head><p>Based on some intial experiments in our lab, we found that the nucleation behaviour of the Au process on Si-H and SiO2 substrates differs significantly from each other, see SEM images in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. We expect that OH groups on the substrate can influence the nucleation on the substrate. Therefore, we studied the nucleation behaviour in situ using XRF and GISAXS on three different substrates that each have a different amount of OH groups on the surface: Si-H (0 OH/nm 2 ), thermal SiO2 (1 OH/nm 2 ) and LPCVD SiO2 (5 OH/nm 2 ). The Au loading, derived from the in situ XRF measurements, versus ALD cycles graph shows reduced growth on the H-terminated Si. The GISAXS patterns recorded in situ for the 3 processes reveal a clear difference in the morphological evolution of the Au NPs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), where we estimate the center-to-center distance (D) between neighboring NPs as 2π/qy,max, with qy,max the qy-position of the main scattering peak. It is clear that the spacing between the Au NPs on Si-H vs. SiO2 is very different, as expected from the SEM images. Due to the fewer OH groups on the initial surface, the particles are spaced further apart. The difference in spacing between the two SiO2 surfaces (1 and 5 OH groups per nm 2 , respectively) is however not that obvious. A possible explanation is that, for this range of OH densities, the nucleation density is governed by the size of the Au precursor rather than the OH density.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ study of Au NPs deposited on Ru seed layers</head><p>Because metal-on-metal nucleation is typically very different from metal-on-dielectric nucleation, we also investigated Au ALD on Ru seed layers. A first experiment used a sputtered Ru layer, but as this layer also gave rise to a pronounced GISAXS pattern, it proved to be difficult to distinguish the pattern caused by the Au NP's from that of the seed layer. In another experiment, we deposited a Ru seed layer via ALD, without breaking the vacuum between the Ru deposition and the Au deposition. The ultrathin Ru seed layer appeared smooth in GISAXS, while the in situ deposition avoids oxidation of the Ru layer. On the other hand, the in situ GISAXS data showed that the Au ALD process clearly resulted in Au NPs instead of a continuous Au layer (scattering patterns not shown here).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Annealing of Au NPs in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres</head><p>Finally, we annealed different coupons of the same sample in different atmospheres to investigate the coarsening behavior and thermal stability of the Au NPs on the surface. The coupons were annealed to 900°C at a rate of 0.2°C/s. The starting GISAXS pattern and SEM image of the sample before annealing can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The final surface looks very different for all annealing conditions, as can be seen by the SEM image and the GISAXS pattern before and after each anneal. Using a reducing atmosphere (5% H2 in He) caused the largest change in the particle size and spacing. For the oxidizing and inert atmospheres, the increase in particle size and spacing is less pronounced. The reason for this distinct difference is not yet clear to us. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The synchrotron campaign allowed us to study the nucleation during Au ALD. Simulations to complement the quick GISAXS analysis shown here are ongoing, and the work is in progress of being written down in a publication. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: SEM images and GISAXS patterns for the starting sample and after annealing under different atmospheres.
