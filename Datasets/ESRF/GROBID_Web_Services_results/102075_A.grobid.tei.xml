<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>To improve the efficiency of siRNA delivery, we have synthesized a small library of lipids with dual pHresponsive behavior that can be incorporated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). When triggered by low pH conditions, these lipid molecules release fatty acids inside the LNPs, causing nanostructural rearrangements and providing new pH-responsive capacities. We were interested in following colloidal and nanostructural changes upon changing the lipid composition in these LNPs either by changing the formulation (mixing different ratios of lipids) or as a result of pH-triggered degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Because fatty acids are created as a result of the pH-triggered degradation, special attention was needed to keep the pH of the reaction constant. The experimental design initially envisioned relied on a flow-through setup where the LNPs would reside in a reaction vessel (eppendorf tube) and would be contunuously pumped into the X-ray beam through a flow-through capillary by means of a peristaltic pump. The would allow us to monitor the pH in the reaction vessel and automatically adjust the pH using a programmed syringe pump that would dispense NaOH to neutralize the released acid. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the experimental setup where two eppendorf tubes containing LNPs are lowered into a water bath kept at 37 °C in the centre, flanked by two syringe pumps on either side. The pumps are loaded with syringes containing NaOH and the syringes' needles are pointed into the eppendorf tubes. pH electrode probes are inserted into each of the eppendorf tubes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for a close up) to monitor the pH values and the pH meter device is off screen. The LNPs were stirred with tiny magnetic stirrers. Two flow-through capillaries were put into the capillary holder of the beamline and connected by HPLC tubing to the corresponding eppendorf tubes containing the LNPs. The tubing was fed through a peristaltic pump to continuously feed the LNPs through the capillaries. The capillary holder could then be regularly moved to collect scattering patterns from either of the two capillaries periodically. Unfortunately, the dead volume within the HPLC tubes was not compatible with the sample volume that could be produced for a reliable SAXS measurement. Due to expensive nature of the siRNA-loaded LNPs and the relatively high concentrations required for a reliable SAXS measurement, only limited volume of the samples could be produced and was unfortunately not sufficient for a viable flow-through experiment. Regular samples had to be taken from the eppendorf tubes manually and loaded into borosilicate capillaries for static SAXS measurements. For samples that did not degrade very fast, the pH could be monitored and adjusted manually. The samples were kept at 37 °C and continuously mixed using a shaker from the PSCM lab (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The scattering setup had a sample-to-detector distance of 2458 mm and wavelength of 1.0332 Å for the SAXS experiments, providing an approximate q range of 0.09 -4.7 nm -1 . Measuring WAXS was not of importance and the position of the detector was optimized. Cappillaries used were 1.5 mm thick.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The control experiment contained LNPs made using the commercially available lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) without the presence of any pH-degradable lipid. Regular SAXS measurements were collected over a 24 h period while the pH was kept at 7.4 and are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. As expected, the samples exhibited a low-q upturn in intensity due to the presence of particles with dimensions larger than the experimental resolution of the setup (diameter measured by DLS is around 120 nm, so we presumably see the scattering from their surface at low-q). Additionally, a correlation peak could be observed at around q ~ 1 nm -1 , attributed to the internal arrangement of siRNA within the LNPs. The curves did not exhibit significant changes over time.  In parallel, the same LNPs were subjected to pH 5.5 for 2 h and then had their pH returned back to 7.4. This was done to simulate the pH conditions that could be encountered in the endosome upon uptake of these LNPs by cells. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the SAXS patterns before the low pH conditions, during the low pH conditions (0h -2h), and upon return of pH to neutral conditons (pH 7.4, 2h -24h). Due to changes in the protonation state of the amine group on DLin-MC3-DMA, the LNPs undergo structural rearrangements at low pH. Note that the changes are nearly fully reversible when the pH is returned to 7.4. After pH is returned to 7.4, the structure remains stable for the rest of the experiment. When the LNPs with DLin-MC3-DMA were made with the newly synthesized lipid pMeO PABC OA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), their nanostructure was observed to gradually change over time when kept at pH 7.4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). The low-q upturn remained, while the correlation peak at q ~ 1 nm -1 gradually dissapeared over time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).  When the LNPs containing the degradable mMeO PABC OA lipid were subjected to 2 h at pH 5.5, the correlation peak at q ~ 1 nm -1 became more pronounced at pH 5.5 and then shifted to lower q values when pH returned to 7.4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Over time, the correlation peak was observed to shift to even lower q values and gradually diminish in intensity. Most interestingly, if the lipid mMeO PABC OA was modified with an amide bond instead of the imine bond (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>), the molecule would not undergo pH-triggered degradation. When making LNPs contaning the pH-resistant amide version of mMeO PABC OA, the internal nanostructure of the LNPs appeared to be remain largely intact at pH 7.4 and even when subjected to pH 5.5 for 2 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">10</ref>     Similar data has been collected for a multitude of lipids, shown in Figure 12. For lipids containing an ionizable tertriary amine group, the LNPs were created by replacing the DLin-MC3-DMA lipid with the newly synthesized one. Additionaly experiments were carried out using lipids that were functionalized with drug molecules IMDQ and STING at the of their PEG tails (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>). These lipids were formulated into LNPs using HSPC and DSPE as a helper lipids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>). The resulting SAXS patterns (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">14</ref>) could not be fitted with a sphere model or a core-shell bicelle model. Instead, a two-shell bicelle model from <ref type="bibr">Yang et. al., Langmuir 2019, 35, 9483-9492</ref> had to be used to account for the additional PEG layer that contained the drug molecules. The model code has been implemeted with IgorPro and fitting is currently on the way.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>pH-triggered colloidal transformations were observed as a function of pH and time. By varying the lipid composition, the kinetics of these transformations could be tuned. Namely, chemical modifications to the lipids that would stabilize the imine bond (by converting it to an amide bond, or by changing the substituents on the benzene right (different variants listed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>)) were found to influence how fast the internal nanostructure would rearrange itself.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
