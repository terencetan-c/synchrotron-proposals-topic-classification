<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>A We were expecting to observe the most pronounced changes for C0-BTBT, but it becomes clear from Figs.1 and 2 that the film structure of C0-BTBT is very insensitive to temperature changes. In contrast, C12-BTBT shows a small but clear shift of the peak positions as the temperature is reduced. Since our beamtime was scheduled from the 31.08. -05.09.2016 we have not been able to fully analyze the data, but the lower panel in Fig. 2 compares the relative change in peak positions at 300K and 100K for the two samples which show the least and the most pronounced change with temperature. Here, a clear trend can be observed and the longer the side chain length the more pronounced are the temperature induced changes in the lattice parameters. Fig. 2: Upper row: Comparison of GID -scans of C0-BTBT (left) and C12-BTBT (right) at 300K and 100K. Lower row: Change of peak positions at 100K relative to the 300K reference (left). Grey box: Comparison of XRD-scan of a spin-coated (light red) and thermally evaporated (dark red) C18-BTBT sample at 100K. The inset shows the clear splitting of th e Bragg-peak in the evaporated sample possibly due to a phase transition or reorganization of molecules.</p><p>In addition to the experiments proposed we performed further studies to investigate how the film preparation procedure affects the film structure and its temperature dependence. Here, we compared films of C18-BTBT prepared by spin coating and molecular beam deposition. The comparison of both samples is shown in the grey box in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Surprisingly, we have indications that the film structure of the sample prepared by molecular beam deposition differs from the spin coated sample, indicated by the appearance of an additional Bragg-peak (see green box in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The origin of this feature is so far still unclear and has also not been reported in the literature. One possible reason might be the differences in the film formation process of the two techniques, where the increased growth time during evaporation gives the molecules time to reorganize into a energetically favorable structure.</p><p>In conclusion, we studied temperature induced changes in the lattice parameters of technologically relevant high mobility derivaties of BTBT. In contrast to our expectations, we observed the most pronounced changes in the derivatives with long side chains of n&gt;8. This is for us a surprising finding as we would have expected the opposite behavior, but demonstrates the importance of these measurements for the interpretation of temperature dependent changes in device performance, in particular the charge carrier mobility in field effect transistors. Another interesting finding is the appearance of an additional Bragg-peak in the C18-BTBT sample prepared by thermal evaporation, which points towards a possible polymorphism in BTBT which is strongly affected by preparation conditions. Since further investigations would help to obtain a deeper understanding, a proposal to study this effect will be submitted to the ESRF shortly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Comparison of XRD-scans of C0-BTBT (left) and C12-BTBT (right) at 300K and 100K.
