<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aperiodic crystals are long range ordered structure lacking lattice translation. Their structure is well described by the superspace approach which introduces additional degrees of freedom <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. However, the behaviour and atomic realisations of the excitation modes associated to these new degrees of freedom are still debated. In the long wavelength limit, diffuse excitations called phason modes are predicted and have been observed as damped phonon modes in a few incommensurately modulated phases and as purely diffusive excitations in quasicrystals [1; 2]. However, their existence and characterisation incommensurate composites is controversial.</p><p>In this experiment, we proposed to measure phason modes in the well characterised incommensurate composite crystal Sr [1+x] TiS 3 . It is composed of two intermodulated sublattices of Sr and TiS 3 forming parallel chains along the c axis with incommensurate periodicities <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Phason modes would correspond to the relative 'sliding' of the two sublattices along c. Few theoretical predictions are available (e.g. [4; 5]). It has been suggested that the two sublattices might give rise to two different velocities, although this has not been proven rigorously. The phason mode or sliding mode should be measurable around the satellites reflections associated to the incommensurability and located along the c* axis.</p><p>We used a needle shaped sample of section 20 x 10 µm and length 200µm grown in the laboratory of crystallography, University of Bayreuth, by the group of Sander van Smaalen. First, we performed diffraction experiments at room temperature and at 100K using the ID28 side station. We recorded full maps of reciprocal space by a 360° phi rotation and 0.1° steps. The main plane in reciprocal space have been extracted as shown for the H0L plane the figure 1. We observed many satellite reflection along the incommensurability axis c* and were able to index the reflections as a 54/47 approximant, with c*= 2.990 Å -1 . We also observed diffuse scattering lines along c*, accounting for some correlations close to a tripling of the cell along (110).</p><p>The sample was then mounted on a goniometer head and oriented to work in the k=0 plane in order to perform inelastic X-ray scattering measurements at room temperature. We used the Si (9 9 9) setup and focussing optics with an energy resolution of the order 3 meV. We made our measurements on the (6 0 0) reflection which served as reference, the (0 0 108) which is a Sr sub-lattice contribution, the (1 0 94) which is a TiS3 sub-lattice contribution, and the (0 0 87) which is a mixed contribution of both sub-lattices. For each, we measured both longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonon dispersion. Energy scans were about 4 h long. In order to get enough points in the dispersions curves of the phonons, TA phonons required scans for at least four detectors positions, whereas TA phonons required only two.</p><p>We were not able to evidence phason modes, but acoustic phonon measurements do show some differences in the dynamic from a sublattice to another. Phonons were fitted with dumped harmonic oscillator in order to recover the dispersion curve as displayed on the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. No major differences were found for the TA phonons in the acoustic regime with a similar slope of about 16meV/ Å -1 . On the other hand, the longitudinal phonon measurements are indicating a different sound velocity for the (0 0 108) reflection compared to (1 0 94) or (0 0 87) reflections, although we were not able to measure the phonon at low q. This indicates that the longitudinal modes do propagate differently along the Sr and TiS 3 chains of the lattice.</p><p>Although no indication of phason modes was found, the data analysis is still in progress and the preliminary results do suggest an actual differences in the dynamics relative to the two sublattices at room temperature. This results will be completed by more recent experiments on the diffuse scattering and low q phonon measurements that are supporting this difference in sound velocities. Further experiments would be necessary to compare with higher temperatures were sliding modes might be expected to show up.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Imaging the (h0l) plane.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,342.00,548.80,221.40,187.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
