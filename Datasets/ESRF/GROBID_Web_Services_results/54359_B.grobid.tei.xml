<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Noroviruses belong to the Calciviriridae family of small positive-sense RNA viruses and are the leading causes of gastroenteritis around the world with an estimated 21 million cases per annum. The error prone replication mechanism of noroviruses generates a high genetic diversity amongst its five genogroups. The rapid emergence of new strains that are antigenically distinct from their predecessors hinders the effective treatment of norovirus outbreaks.</p><p>Structurally characterizing the surface architecture of multiple norovirus strains helps in designing superior therapeutics and vaccines to effectively tackle the outbreaks. The virus is structurally viewed as an icosahedron that is composed of 180 copies of capsid protein arranged into 90 dimers. Each capsid protein displays a shell (S) domain and protruding (P) domain. The S domains interlock to form an icosahedron, while the P domains interact with cell receptors and aid in the internalization and pathogenicity of the virus. We are interested in charactering the structural mechanisms employed by the P-domains to bind to their potential partners through X-ray crystallography. These binding partners include naturally occurring histo-blood-group antigens (HBGAs) which are thought to act as co-receptors for internalization and synthetic drug moieties that inhibit norovirus infection.</p><p>We have co-crystallized the P-domains of two infectious strains of noroviruses -Snowy Mountain Virus (SMV) and Hawaiian Virus (HV) with HBGAs and synthetic ligands. During this trip to ESRF, we have collected x-ray diffraction data on many co-crystals of P-domains and ligands. The data collection statistics of the crystals, which yielded good diffraction are listed below. We solved all the data-sets by employing the molecular replacement method. Currently we are refining the structures of P-domains and closely inspecting the electron density difference maps for potential ligand binding sites Datasets collected on the co-crystals of P-domains and ligands.</p><p>1.
