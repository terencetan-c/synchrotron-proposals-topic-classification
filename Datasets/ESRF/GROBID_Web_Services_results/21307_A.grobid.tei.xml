<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">-Centres of calcification and crystal-like fibres exhiibit two distinct patterns with respect to the S-sulfated glucidic compounds.</head><p>High concentrations are present in early mineralization zones (the "centres of calcification").</p><p>In fibres, sulfated compound concentrations are weaker, but a banding pattern is visible, that corresponds to fibre growth steps that are evidenced by chemical etchings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">-Cyclic repartition of sulfated glucids exactly matches the calcareous fibre growth steps.</head><p>This correspondance strongly suggests that glucids are involved in the mineralization process. This hypothesis founds additional support in the corrrelation between the biochemical diversity of these skeletal compounds and the taxonomy linked properties of skeletal fibres, from crystallinity to isotopic fractionation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>localization of organic sulfate within coral skeletons are studied by using XANES fluorescence method. After checking by Raman spetrometry that no mineral sulfate is present, XANES spectra are recorded from four reference sulfur bearing organic molecules : two amino acids (H-S-C bonds in cystein; C-S-C bonds in methionin) , one disulfur bond (C-S-S-C bonds in cystine) and a sulfated glucidic compound (C-SO4 bonds in chondroitin sulfate). Spectral responses of three coral skeletons show that the sulfated form of sulfur is extremely dominant in coral aragonite, and practically exclusive within both centres of calcification and the surrounding fibrous tissues of coral septa.The above picture is an example of results we got in the CH 1162 experiment. a : polished section of coral fixed onto the holding-plate (hole diameter 1.2 mm b : UV fluorescence picture showing the early mineralization zone (= centres of calcification)-picture made at Orsay during the preparative step c : SEM picture of microctructural feature at the analyzed zone ( picture made at Orsay, after the ESRF experiment) d : Mapping of sulfur in the sulfated coordination made at the ID 21 line. e: enlarged view of the growth steps in fibres : the S-sulfate banding pattern visible in fig.d precisely matches the mictrostructural growth steps (i.e. the cyclic deposition of calcium carbonate that built the coral skeleton units).</figDesc></figure>
