<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Study of the crystallization forces during peridotite serpentinization and carbonation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of experiment ES-277 was to perform high-quality multi-resolution 3D observations of hydrothermally altered olivine-rich rocks in order to (a) map the redistribution of mineral phases resulting from water-rock interactions and (b) detect the development of cracks and/or evidences of stress-induced alteration. The proposed strategy was to analyse a series of olivine samples before and after hydrothermal flow-through experiments using a multi-scale approach: the samples were to be analysed at 2 high resolution setups (1.1µm and 0.18 µm) to track the onset of cracking resulting from water-rock reactions at mineralmineral and water-mineral interfaces. In order to realize the HP-HT hydrothermal experiments, samples were to be enclosed in a thin titanium body (with low absorption for X-ray) specifically designed for the ESRF experiment. 5 shifts were requested to image (a) the unreacted samples (phase 1, 1 shift) and (b) the reacted samples using 2 different resolutions (phase 2, 4 shifts). The project was attributed 6 shifts : twice 3 shifts at a 3 month interval (April &amp; July).</p><p>Upon approval of the project, we launched the fabrication of the Ti-jackets specifically designed for the ESRF experiments and contacted the ESRF local contact team to assess precisely the experiment. We rapidly identified a major yet unforseen impediment : a minimum thickness is needed to manufacture Tijackets and this thickness is too thick to allow &lt;0.2µm resolution imaging of the olivine samples altered during the hydrothermal experiments. Multiresolution imaging of experimental samples was therefore precluded on these samples. With the help of the ESRF local contact team, we modified our strategy in order to reach our objectives. We divided the experiments as 2 sets of analyses using the following setups:</p><p>• Analyses of olivine aggregates in Ti-tubes before and after hydrothermal experiments (resolution 0.65µm Beam 55 KeV): 6 samples were prepared, 4 were analysed before experiments (only 3 in april and 1 in july) and 2 after experiments (july). The data are still being processed but analyses of snapshots show clear indications of dissolution and precipitation (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>• Multiresolution analyses of variously serpentinized and carbonated peridotites from the Oman ophiolite (Beam 19 KeV): several minicores (Length 5 mm -Diameter 1.7 mm) were analysed with a 0.65µm resolution (8 in april and 9 in july) and a subset of 10 were analysed with a 0.16µm resolution (5 in april and 5 in july) These tests showed the feasibility of the approach and its usefulness to address our scientific objectives (e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>The preliminary analyses (data of the second phase received only a few days ago) of the dataset indicate that this approach is promising, but we can see now that it could be improved to better trace the studied process both in term of experimental procedure (in Montpellier) and image acquisition (ESRF). For instance we encountered some problems of registration for the handling and comparison of multi-resolution images and therefore for quantifying the physical parameters controling the reactivity of the rocks. According to our ESRF contact, a sequential multiresolution approach thus appears more adapted and we hope to implement this technique in a continuation project. Also, only 2 experimental samples were analysed and we must now finalize our research experimental program which requires exploring more samples to tackle the dependence of the mass transfers to the experimental conditions and measure the processes variability.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):• 13-14 Avr. 2015: M.
