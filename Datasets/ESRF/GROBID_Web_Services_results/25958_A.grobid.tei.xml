<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A quantitative explanation of the exchange coupling between ferromagnetic (F) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers require an adequate characterization of the structure and of the exchange interactions at the interface on an atomic level. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Recently a F-AF system with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), namely a [Co(4 Å)/Pt(5 Å)] 5 multilayer covered by a partially oxidized polycrystalline Co film, was studied. 2 It showed a strong exchange anisotropy below 220 K. The aim of our project was to elaborate a closely related system with a better defined structure, growing the CoO layer directly in contact with the Pt and improving its structure to increase the strength of the coupling, the PMA and the blocking temperature.</p><p>The first step was the growth of a CoO layer directly on top of Pt(111). For this purpose, an iterative procedure was repeated n times: 1 ML Co was evaporated in UHV conditions, and then was oxidized by exposure to about 10 Langmuir of O 2 . The first ML was deposited at room temperature (RT), and then the temperature was increased and kept at 160°C for the following steps. No significant Pt segregation was observed during the annealing. It is known that, after deposition of 1 ML at RT, Co takes preferably the Pt fcc lattice sites, with a small amount of atoms in disordered or hcp sites. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The epitaxial relationship was observed by surface x-ray diffraction (XRD). As usual, a unit cell was chosen with a and b defining a hexagonal surface mesh and c perpendicular to the surface. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a scan in reciprocal space parallel to the surface, along the K direction, at different stages of growth. The first Co ML is mainly in register with the substrate (the Pt rod intensity decrease strongly). After 2 cycles of Co deposition followed by oxidation, a rod characteristic of a relaxed CoO(111) film appears, which is better defined for 3 CoO layers. The intensity distribution is flat in the regions of Co(0001) and of Co 3 O 4 (111) rods. The CoO(111) surface is polar and hence intrinsically unstable. For this reason, it was found that bulk CoO( <ref type="formula">111</ref>) is covered by a Co 3 O 4 (111) layer at the surface. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> XRD shows that this do not happens in our case. In NiO(111) the surface is stabilized by a p(2x2) reconstruction. Such a 4 C. Mocuta, A. Barbier, G. Renaud, Appl. Surf. Sci. 162-163, 56 (2000). Finally, a F-AF interface was studied. We have already shown that a two-layer thick surface alloy is grown by deposition of ~1 ML Co onto a Pt( <ref type="formula">111</ref>) crystal held at 300°C. The top layer is very rich in Pt, and the second one very rich in Co. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> This bilayer is ferromagnetic at room temperature, with a strong PMA. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In the present experience, this surface alloy on Pt( <ref type="formula">111</ref>) was elaborated at first, and then a 12 layer thick CoO oxide was grown on top as described above. XRD allows studying both the ferromagnetic bilayer, which is in coherent epitaxy, and the relaxed CoO film. Two sets of rods need to be analyzed (see fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The shape of the measured Pt rod is characteristic of an interface with a Co rich layer underneath a Pt rich one (see fig.</p><p>4 and ref. 5).</p><p>The analysis of the CoO rod shows that the presence of the alloy bilayer at the interface do not modify the stacking within the oxide layer.</p><p>A more quantitative analysis is still in progress.</p><p>The magnetic measurements on this sample will be performed ex-situ as soon as possible.</p><p>5 M.

The stacking of the CoO layers was studied by measuring its rods. In an ideal CoO(111) film the Co sublattice can either follow the Pt fcc stacking (domain A) or be twinned (domain B). In fig.2the (0.92 0) rod measured for sample thickness of 3 CoO layers and of 6 CoO layers is shown, and compared to the simulation for the two kind of stacking of a perfect 6 CoO layer. The fig.2shows clearly that only the B type of stacking is present. The data reproduce quite well both the peak positions and the structure factor ratio expected for the NaCl structure type (the intensity measured at L=-2, 1 and 4 comes from the close Pt Bragg reflections). The absence of Kiessig fringes shows that the surface or/and the interface is quite rough, however this cannot be discussed in detail without taking into account the misfit structure. The growth of a single domain is closely linked to the interface structure. As next step, we tried to elaborate the CoO oxide directly by deposition of 6 ML Co/Pt(111) at room temperature, followed by O 2 exposure. Both the oxidation at room temperature and at 160°C result in the growth of the two kind of domains. This is due to the presence of stacking fault in the as deposited Co film, which are not recovered during the oxygen intercalation.</figDesc></figure>
