<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) is getting an increasing interest because it allows studying thicker and/or buried layers (up to few tens of nm) than traditional XPS, keeping the chemical sensitivity. In HAXPES, monochromatic hard X-rays are used as excitation source (photon energies &gt; 3 keV), so high kinetic energies photoelectrons are excited. For elemental quantification purposes, reliable attenuation lengths (AL) or IMFP for high kinetic energy electrons have to be used. Although extrapolation of well-established formulae can be used, there is a strong interest in the experimental evaluation of these quantities to validate (or not) the proposed formulae. This is of special interest when we deal with mesoporous materials, i.e., materials with pores sizes smaller than the expected IMFP for high energy photoelectrons.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Well characterized compact and porous SiO 2 thin films samples were deposited on polished Si(100) wafers. The compact SiO 2 thin films were produced by reactive magnetron sputtering and the porous SiO 2 films (55% of compact SiO 2 and 45% of voids) were prepared by electron beam evaporation with glancing angle deposition (GLAD) configuration. No cleaning procedure was used before their HAXPES characterization. HAXPES analyses were performed using a high energy FOCUS electron spectrometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Photon energies of about 10.0, 12.5 and 15.0 keV were used to excite Si 1s signal of the samples (from the SiO 2 films and the Si substrate). The energy resolution ΔE/E of the beamline was 1.5×10 -4 . Si 1s photoemitted electrons of about 8.2, 10.7 and 13.2 keV were recorded with spectrometer energy resolution of 1 eV. The acceptance angle during HAXPES acquisition was ±5⁰. The angle of incidence α of the radiation was 85⁰ with respect to the surface normal and the emission angle θ was 15⁰ off normal.</p><p>The beam size was about 0.5x0.5 mm 2 and the number of photons at the sample was about 2×10 11 ph/s. X-ray reflectometry (XRR) measurements were performed in situ (at the same vacuum chamber that the HAXPES measurements) to characterize the thickness and roughness of the SiO 2 films at exactly the same sample position where the HAXPES characterization was made.</p><p>Evaluation of the ALs was done using the two-peak overlayer method that applies to the determination of SiO 2 thickness on Si wafers as described by Seah et al. in a series of papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. According to these authors, ALs can be obtained from the expression</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">AL(E) = d / (cosθ • ln (1+(R expt (E)/R 0 )))<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where R expt (E) is the I Si 4+ /I Si 0 intensity ratio of the Si 1s signals from the SiO 2 layer and the Si substrate in the HAXPES spectra, and R 0 is the equivalent ratio of intensities, I 0,Si 4+ and I 0,Si 0 , from bulk oxide and substrate, respectively. R 0 can be evaluated theoretically <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">R 0 ≈ 0.20 • ρ SiO2 • (λ SiO2 /λ Si ) (2)</formula><p>where ρ SiO2 is the density (gr/cm 3 ) of the SiO 2 film (evaluated from optical measurements in this work). λ SiO2 /λ Si corresponds to the ratio of the inelastic mean free path for electrons travelling in the SiO 2 overlayer and Si substrate. To a good approximation this ratio is a constant, that according to TPP2M gets the values 1.26 and 1.50 for the compact and porous SiO 2 , respectively. Thus, the theoretical values of R 0 in eqn.(2) are 0.53 and 0.36 for the compact and porous SiO 2 . At this point it is worth mentioning that the use of R 0 = 0.93 has been recommended in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> for compact SiO 2 based on standard XPS measurements. This was mainly justified as a relative lack of intensity at the Si 1s peak of the metallic state compared to the oxide state due to the corresponding uneven contribution of shake-ups at the first plasmon excitation.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> shows HAXPES Si 1s spectra (raw data) corresponding to a porous (left) and compact (right) SiO 2 samples acquired using 10.0, 12.5 and 15.0 keV photon energies. The characteristic Si 4+ and Si 0 signal from the SiO 2 layer and Si substrate are clearly identified. Besides, the Drude plasmon excited at the Si substrate is also clearly visible at 17.2 ± 0.1 eV lower kinetic energies than the Si 0 signal. Bulk plasmon in Si 0 is reported with 16.8 eV energy loss both from reflection electron energy loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and standard photoemission experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The difference (about 0.4 eV) can be ascribed to recoil effect due to the high energy of the emitted electrons, in agreement with theoretical predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> depicts the calculated experimental AL values for the compact (full symbols; circles, squares) and porous (hollow symbols) SiO 2 films, evaluated from the quantification of the measured Si 1s spectra of the SiO 2 thin films according to eqn(1) and the theoretical R 0 according to eqn <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> also includes the evaluation of AL for the compact (full stars) and porous (hollow stars) SiO 2 samples considering R 0 = 0.93. These AL are about the largest (between 15 and 35 nm) experimental AL values ever reported for photoelectrons with kinetic energies in the 8-13 keV. This figure also includes theoretical IMFP obtained from extrapolation for high kinetic energies of the TPP2M formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for the compact (full line) and porous (dashed line) SiO 2 films considered in this work.</p><p>The experimental AL values obtained for the compact SiO 2 samples, are ∼10% lower (R 0 =0.53) or ∼17% higher (R 0 =0.93) than the prediction of the TPP2M formula.
