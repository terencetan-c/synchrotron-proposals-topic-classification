<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imaging a supercritical water crystallisation vessel using in-situ diffraction</head><p>Our aim in this experiment was to use a combination of high-energy angle-and energydispersive diffraction to probe the interior of a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) reactor in-operando. CHFS provides a route for the controlled synthesis of nanoparticle materials. The work is a continuation of work carried out in MA387, here the aim was to investigate the synthesis of hydroxyapatite (HA) and ceria under a number of conditions. The beam-time took place June/July 2008 so the data is still being processed. Nevertheless, a few preliminary results are shown below.</p><p>The setup was that similar to that we achieved in MA-387. The CHFS reactor was mounted on a translational stage in order to carry out spatial angle-dispersive and energy-dispersive mode diffraction (which requires with switching between monochromatic and white beams).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows some selected results from HA synthesis using diammonium hydrogen phosphate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate. We were worried that the signal from this phase was low, so only carried out a limited number of studies with this material and then switched to the synthesis of ceria from cerium ammonia nitrate. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the intensity maps, i.e. the distribution of the phase, as determined by angle-dispersive diffraction at three synthesis temperatures which clearly show differences. At super-critical temperatures the majority of material forms away from the inner nozzle. We will construct similar maps of crystallite size (determined from peak width analysis). These results and those derived from experiment MA387 (which are under review for publication in a leading journal) represent the first look inside a functioning CHFS reactor. This information is critical to the understanding and design of both CHFS processes and reactors.</p><p>Dr Simon Jacques. September 2008</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Photograph (A) and schematic (B) of CHFS reactor. The reactor is spatially scanned and at each scanned point, diffraction is collected in the chosen mode; here, single 2D powder ADD pattern (C). This is integrated to obtain a conventional 1D powder (D); overlaid are the reflections positions for HA. Intensity and peak widths can be mapped. (E) shows the 211 HA reflection over 4 traverse lines (two vertical and two horizontal) inside the steel CHFS reactor; here the steel walls are indicated.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,179.05,399.70,88.25,164.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
