<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim in this study was to investigate the solid-state chemistry within a working catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to produce C2 molecules, principally ethylene. We employed dynamic X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) and absorption micro computed tomography (µCT) to image the reactor in situ under preparation and operando conditions. In our study the CMR consisted of a hollow fibre dense ceramic membrane packed with a catalyst bed (see schematic in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The CMR was housed within a quartz tube and mounted onto a gas delivery stub such that a methane stream could be passed from the inner side and air stream could be controlled from the outer side of the membrane. The ceramic membrane is an oxygen transport membrane that activates at high temperature (&gt;650°C) allowing selective diffusion of oxygen ions towards the catalyst within the membrane. The gas products were monitored in line by mass spectrometry. A number of reactor configurations were tested: (1) BaCo x Fe y Zr z O 3-δ with Mn-Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 catalyst; (2) BaCo x Fe y Zr z O 3-δ with La-Mn-Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 catalyst; and (3) La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3-δ with La-Mn-Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 catalyst. We also tested two fixed bed reactors with Mn-Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 and La-Mn-Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 catalysts. In all cases, XRD-CT was performed as the reactors were heated to expected industrial operating conditions; XRD-CT were recorded at a set of fixed temperatures 675, 725 and 775°C. At operating temperature (775°C) we varied the concentration of methane (5, 20, 50 and 100%) in helium. Our analysis is in progress but here we report some initial results form the BaCo x Fe y Zr z O 3-δ with Mn-Na 2 WO 4 /SiO 2 catalyst. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> show µCT maps prior to and after OCM overlaid with phase maps constructed from the XRD-CT data including the cristobalite (purple), Na 2 WO 4 (red) and BaWO 4 (green) phases; see figure panels A-F. It is important to state that the mass spectrometer showed that ethylene was indeed formed during the in situ OCM; see figure panel G. We observed the migration of W from the catalyst and subsequent formation of the BaWO 4 at the inner side of the membrane. This is independently confirmed by post mortem SEM-WDS analysis which shows the presence of tungsten at the membrane surface; see figure panel H. A summed diffraction (from reconstructed XRD-CT data) from pixels of interest is shown in panel I over which the identified phases have been overlaid as stick intensities. These results are interesting as the formation of BaWO 4 is likely to be inhibitory to the stability and performance of the catalytic membrane reactor. We have, of course, the corresponding XRD-CT and µCT data during reaction but this is not presented here as the analysis is on going.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Panels A and B show reconstructed slices from micro-CT measurements of the CMR before and after the OCM2 experiment at room temperature. Panels C and D are the same images repeated with the distribution of cristobalite as found from XRD-CT overlaid in violet. Panels E and F, again contain the micro-CT slices but here overlaid with the distributions of Na 2 WO 4 (red) and BaWO 4 (green). Panel G shows the mass spectroscopy data that correspond to the following masses: 4 (He -cyan), 15 (CH 4 -blue), 28 (N 2 , CO, C 2 H 4 + -green), 32 (O 2 -red), 44 (CO 2 -black) and 26 (C 2 H 2 + -magenta). Panel H shows the overlaid WDS elemental maps for Ba (grayscale) and W (green). Panel I shows a summed diffraction pattern from some selected green pixels. Overlaid on this pattern are sticks of database intensities for phases BaWO 4 (green), cristobalite (magenta), Mn 2 O 3 (blue), tridymite (yellow) and BCFZ (grey).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Left: Image showing the CMR. Top right: Within an XRD-CT image each pixel has a corresponding diffraction pattern; the graph inset top right shows two selected diffraction patterns: one from the membrane (yellow trace) and one from the catalyst region (purple trace); note, here the purple trace also contains a signal from the membrane due to an absorption artefact which has yet to be corrected for. Images can be constructed that correspond to features (i.e. Bragg reflections) within the diffraction patterns.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,63.50,53.40,468.20,212.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
