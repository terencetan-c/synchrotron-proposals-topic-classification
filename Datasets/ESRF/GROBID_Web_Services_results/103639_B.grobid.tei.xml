<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment was in continuation of our ES1316-1 experiment in July 2023. The aim here was to use a different nanoparticle formulation, with an inorganic core made of Vanadium insrzat of Terbium to ease for its detection, as Tb fluorescence emission overlaps with Fe. The aim was to study how (i) the protein on protoplast surface and (ii) the functional groups at the nanoparticles' surface are a driver for nanoparticles to cross lipidic membranes. The core in that experiment was a vanadium-phtalocyanine that was stabilized with a shell rich in either carboxyl groups, alkyl chains, or amine groups. We used a similar system as our July beamtime, where plant cells of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. cumberland) were extracted and their cell wall digested to obtain for protoplasts. This time we also trypsinized the protoplasts to clive for the proteins in the protoplasts surface. This protoplast extraction was perforned at ESRF, on the histology lab using an overnight enzyme digestion procedure. We followed the protol we developed during our July beamline for agar suspension, flash freezing, cryomicrotome sectionning and µ-XRF and µ-XANES using the cryostage. Thanks to our previous experiment in July we had a much better preparation protocol in place, although we still have room for cells preparation improvement. Reference XANES scanes were measured for each of the nanoparticle samples. They confirmed the V-porphyrin speciation.</p><p>The XRF maps and µ-XANES are still being analyzed, but they already indicate that (i) internalization of nanoparticles can occur as confirmed with the XANES spectra, (ii) protoplaste trypsinization influence the NP uptake indicating a role of the surface protein in NP interaction with the cell membrane and (iii) that NP surface functionalization does modulate their capacity to cross lipidic membranes. Further, we identified that the bulk quantification of NP association with cell membrane as currently done in the litterature (centrifugation and ICP-MS) is not a good proxi as heteroaggregation seems to occur between nanoparticles and cell debris. Thanks to these results, we are establishing a new protocol using flow cytometry to better quantify this association. These results will lead to a publication in collaboration between the ESRF, the CNRS-GET and Carnegie Mellon University (USA).</p></div>		</body>
