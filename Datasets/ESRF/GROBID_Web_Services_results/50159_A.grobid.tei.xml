<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The preliminary results obtained at the ESRF bring optimism to adult age-atdeath estimation in archaeological remains, a science that has been notoriously difficult to ascertain. We use root dentine translucency (RDT), which is the gradual infilling of tooth root dentine tubules, as a measure of age at death.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adult tooth roots appear translucent because the occluding mineral has a refractive index similar to the inter-tubular dentinal matrix, allowing light to pass unscattered. Mineral occlusion first appears at the root apex. With age it then advances coronally towards the cementum-enamel junction and medially from the cementum-dentine junction towards the root canal -beginning first on the mesial and distal sides and spreading towards the buccal and lingual sides with increasing progression along the root length. It is a three-dimensional phenomenon.</head><p>In archaeological material, diagenetic changes both on the tooth surface and within the tooth have made RDT difficult to measure using conventional techniques, especially when specimens must remain undestroyed. The approach taken at the ESRF has three main advantages: (i) non-destructive; (ii) takes into consideration the threedimensionality of mineral occlusion; (iii) measures changes in density, which are more direct and objective than conventional measures of translucency.</p><p>The method taken in November 2012 involved scanning archaeological teeth of known age-at-death in bunches of 35 to 67 teeth at 45.96 microns, 100KeV on ID17. In total 319 teeth were scanned at conditions idealized for a dry sample. Scans at 16-bits were used for analysis. Each tooth was virtually extracted from the bunch in VGStudioMax 2.2 to create a new volume. According to the following method, standardized thresholding steps were applied to each tooth to isolate the core dentine and to create a histogram of density within this volume. First a preset filter was applied to isolate the whole tooth. A second preset filter was applied to isolate the core dentine. This core dentine region of interest was sequentially opened +1, closed -1, and eroded -4 in VGStudioMax 2.2 to further isolate the core dentine from both the cementum and the peripheral dentine, which has been shown to demonstrate a translucency that is uncorrelated to known age. The core dentine was then put through a median filter 5 and a final preset was applied to the histogram of the resulting volume. Density measures in the root dentine from these final volumes were correlated to known ages.  <ref type="table">1</ref>. When tooth types were combined into larger groups, correlations on the whole tended to be statistically weak. The noted combination that produced a strong and significant correlation comprised canines and upper incisors; however at the current stage of analysis, a biological explanation cannot be made for this result. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the progression of density changes with age in the group of upper incisors. Tooth Type Number of teeth (number of individuals) Pearson Correlation Upper incisors 9 (7) 0.88 Canines 77 (52) 0.73 Canines + Upper incisors 86 (58) 0.74 Lower first incisors 9 (8) 0.72 Lower second incisors 10 (9) 0.80 Figure 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1. Pearson correlation coefficients between root density and known age</head><p>Further analysis of the premolar and molar groups will help elucidate the current method for analysing density changes in root dentine. It is possible that because of differences in root shape, preset density thresholds will need to be tooth type specific; this is something that will be further explored in the coming months. Further work also includes measuring density in different parts of the root as well as analysis of carious teeth and their fit into the regression lines.</p><p>It is also possible that some teeth are less susceptible to diagenetic change than others and thus will be better indicators of age at death. Photographs of all of the intact teeth positioned against a light box have been previously made to visually record RDT. From these images, anomalous patterns of mineralization have been identified. Another aspect of analysis in the coming months is to analyze patterns of density within the tooth to differentiate mineralization due to diagenetic change and mineralization due to peritubular dentine occlusion.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge the current results indicate the strongest and most objective relationship observed between RDT and known age at death for an archaeological tooth group. More works needs to be performed on the current data set. However, it is with great hope that by combining these results with a more in-depth analysis of mineral occlusion at the tubule-level, we will strengthen the study for a significant contribution to adult age-at-death estimation in archaeological material.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Preliminary results show that the 77 non-carious canines from 52 individuals had a Pearson correlation, r=0.73 (Fig 1), suggesting that canine root density is a statistically strong and significant predictor of age-at-death in these archaeological remains. Densities of teeth belonging to the same individual were averaged. Results from analyses of other non-carious teeth are summarized in Table</figDesc></figure>
