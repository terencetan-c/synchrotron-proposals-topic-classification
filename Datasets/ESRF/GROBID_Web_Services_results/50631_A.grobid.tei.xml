<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The only minor problems were related to the setting-up phase, being an experiment performed for the first time at DUBBLE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Was the local support adequate?</head><p>YES. the support of the local contact, Dr. Giuseppe Portale and of the technical staff was highly important. Also 5. Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned on the project proposal? 6.</p><p>YES. Results have been completely analyzed and agree with our expectations. We focused the investigation on samples of i-PP( isotactic polypropylene) and PA6 (polyamide 6). Submicrograms samples were microtomed and placed on chip-calorimeter sensors (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>)</p><p>By means of Mettler Toledo Flash DSC, different cooling histories were applied to the polymers. The sensor was then extracted and analyzed by meanss of micro-beam WAXD to probe the resulting structure. For more information please contact the secretariat, tel.: +31-70-3440569, e-mail: dubble@nwo.nl</p><p>July 2010</p><p>Examples of the obtained structures are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and 3, which report the WAXD patterns along with a radial integration of the intensities. Despite the extremely low scattering volume, the signal-to-noise ratio is good enough to allow the structural identification.</p><p>Increasing the cooling rate and/or the crystallization temperature, causes for both polymers the developement of a less ordered structure, i.e. a mesophase. We expect that the successful microfocus WAXS experiment on miniature FSC samples offers new chances/opportunities for analysis of crystallization of polymers. FSC allows precise investigation of temperatures and enthalpies of phase transitions as a function of the route of nucleation and crystallization, and subsequently performed WAXS analysis permits unambiguous assignment of thermal transitions to formation of specific phases.</p><p>7. Are you planning follow-up experiments at DUBBLE for this project? YES. This was a feasibility study, and some useful pieces of information that complete previous work of the authors were gained. The success of this experiment opens new possibilities for investigation, in polymeric materials in which the relation between crystallization temperature/cooling rate and structure is unknown (e.g. PBT, PA11…)</p><p>8. Are you planning experiments at other synchrotrons in the near future? NO.</p><p>9. Do you expect any scientific output from this experimental session (publication, patent, ...) YES. We already summarized the result obtained in this beamtime in a draft for a short communication that will be submitted to a proper polymer characterization journal in the first months of 2013.  </p></div>
