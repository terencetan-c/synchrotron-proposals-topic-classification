<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of the current proposal was to determine the effect of uniaxial pressure on the charge density wave (CDW) instability and the associated phonon anomalies in the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.6 superconductor.</p><p>To this end we used a piezoelectric-based apparatus <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, which was suitably adapted to fit in the He-cryostat available in ID28. We therefore were able to combine uniaxial strain with low temperatures, and to perform for the first time in the ID28 beamline a very successful reference experiment under such conditions. An image of the device in the adaptor ring and in the cryostat is given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>We prepared ~30 Î¼m thick needles of high quality detwinned YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.6 (p=0.12, T c = 61 K) single crystals, from the same bunch as the ones used in our earlier ambient and hydrostatic pressure studies <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. The strain was applied along the needle axis and was calibrated using a capacitance sensor and following the position shift of the Bragg reflections. In order to avoid the strong signal from the Cu-O chains along the 100 direction, we measured acoustical and optical phonon dispersions along the 010 direction. We performed temperature and strain dependent inelastic scans, typically in the energy range from -5 to 25 meV. Prior to the strain application, reference spectra were collected at unstrained conditions. The high quality of the obtained data is demonstrated in the spectra of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> (a) which were recorded at T c under 0.1% compressive strain.</p><p>We note that as the experiment was carried out very recently, a detailed analysis of the extensive datasets obtained from the 9 different analysers/detectors remains to be finalized and therefore here we will only include preliminary conclusions. In our earlier IXS study on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.6 , we have observed a low temperature enhancement of the central elastic peak intensity sharply localized around q=q CDW and maximized at T c <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. An important outcome of this experiment is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: according to the current data which reproduce very accurately our earlier results under unstrained conditions, the application of uniaxial strain seems to have a visible effect on the elastic peak intensity at q CDW , which increases up to ~25% relative enhancement under 0.6% compressive strain. Even though the analysis of the phonon part of the spectra is currently ongoing, already at this stage we can report that there seems to be also a response of the previously observed CDW-related phonon anomalies to uniaxial strain application.</p><p>[1] Hicks, C. <ref type="bibr">W., et al., Rev.
