<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study was a proof-of-concept, exploratory study to investigate whether synchrotron radiation (SR) can enhance cisplatin (CDDP) cytotoxicity in two different human cancer cell lines of non-glial origin: A549 non small-cell lung cancer and IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell preparation</head><p>A549 or IGROV-1 cells were plated (3000 cells/well) into flat bottom 96-well plates in complete RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 % Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma), 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). After 24 hr cells were treated with CDDP for 24 hr. A549 cells were treated with CDDP 16.5 or 8.5 µM while IGROV-1 were treated with CDDP 7 or 5 µM. Untreated cells were used as control. After treatment plates were taken to the ID17 beamline to be irradiated and immediately washed with drug free medium.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Irradiation</head><p>A549 and IGROV-1 cells were irradiated with a total dose of 0, 1, 2 and 4 Gy. Both cell lines were irradiated either above (78.8 KeV) and below (78.0 KeV) the Pt K absorption edge (platinum K-edge = 78.395) according to the following schedule:</p><p>A549 IGROV-1 1.

CDDP 5 µM +SR irradiation dose 4Gy</p><p>Cell survival determination 24 hr after irradiation cell survival was determined by MTT assay. For the survival assay cells were incubated for 2 hr at 37°C in MTT solution (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml). Formazan crystals formed were dissolved in DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometric microplate reader. Results obtained on IGROV-1 and A549 cells are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> respectively. Each experimental data point is represented as average value obtained from four replicates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Exposure to SR significantly enhances CDDP activity in both A549 (non small-cell lung cancer) and IGROV-1 (ovarian cancer) tumour cell lines of human origin. In both cell lines this effect is more evident using the lower CDDP dose (8.5 µM in A549; 5 µM in IGROV-1). In fact with the higher CDDP dose used (16.5 µM in A549; 8.5 µM in IGROV-1) the SR effect is hidden by the CDDP cytotoxicity. Furthermore the effect of the SR alone seems to be underestimated. Probably it is due to the time point (24 hr after irradiation) chosen for the estimation of the cell survival. In fact after radiation treatment cells destinated to dye can still undergo one or more cell divisions. For this reason it seems necessary that sufficient time is allowed for the cells to die after they are damaged by radiation. The assay duration has to be adapted to the doubling time of the cells in order to correctly estimate the radiation-induced damage.</p><p>The possibility to use the SRB assay, which is based on the staining of cellular proteins, has also be evaluated. In fact SRB assay shows a wide linear range with cell number with respect to the MTT test and it is not dependent on mitochondrial activity giving a lower variation between cell lines. Furthermore, compared to MTT, SRB is stable for a long period of time and the experimental procedure can be stopped at several steps during the staining protocol. In addition SRB is a suitable assay for in vitro chemoradiation studies. In particular, in the dose range relevant for our study, SRB is comparable in terms of outcome to the clonogenic assay that is generally considered the the optimal test system for in vitro radiation studies <ref type="bibr">(Pauwels et al., 2002)</ref> even if it is time-consuming, laborious and open to subjective interpretation because of manual counting.</p><p>For all these reasons in future experiments we are planning to reduce the CDDP dose in order to treat A549 and IGROV-1 cell lines with a dose of CDDP inducing no more than 5% mortality. Furthermore we will evaluate the survival rate by SRB assay 4 days after irradiation.</p><p>Pauwels B, Korst AE, de Pooter CM, Pattyn GG, Lambrechts HA, Baay MF, Lardon F, Vermorken JB.
