<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pentakis-(methylammonium) undecachlorodibismuthate, (CH 3 NH 3 ) 5 Bi 2 Cl 11 (PMACB), belongs to a rich family of alkylammonium halogenantominate(III) and bismuthate(III) crystals showing interesting polar properties and a number of structural anomalies. In most cases, these anomalies are related to changes of orientational and/or translational disorder of the alkylammonium cations sublattice. However, it has been shown that in PMACB the Bi 2 Cl 11 anion sublattice also contributes to the structural changes <ref type="bibr">(Carpentier et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carpentier et al., 1997)</ref>. We report on the measurement of DAFS at the chlorine K-edge (l K = 4.4 Å) and at the bismuth M V edge (l MV = 4.76 Å) related to structural changes in PMACB.</p><p>The ferroelectric phase of PMACB crystals, which is stable at room temperature, changes to a paraelectric phase at a temperature of 34°C. There is a concomitant change of the space group from Pca2 1 to Pcab. Hence, diffraction experiments were carried out at room temperature and at a temperature well above 34°C. As X-rays at wavelengths near the absorption edges mentioned above are strongly absorbed in air and as the experiment can't be done in vacuum, a helium atmosphere was preferred. A cylindrically bent image plate of 10 cm radius was used as a detector (maximum scattering angle ±123°). For each film the crystal was rotated by 10° with exposure time of 2 minutes at 13 different energies: The 13 spots of a few indexed reflections can be seen on the film. 6 films were necessary for measuring one DAFS spectrum at 78 energies for the same crystal rotation.</p><p>+123°B eam stop -123°4 00 401 112</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>DAFS requires the measurement of well-resolved energy spectra emitted at different wave vectors corresponding to different reflections. Typically, intensities at a hundred energies or more are measured. For technical reasons outlined below we have chosen 78 energies at both the K-edge of chlorine and the M V edge of bismuth.</p><p>The image plate was readout off-line. As the readout time of 12 minutes was much longer than the measuring time of 2 minutes for a 10° rotation of the crystal, 13 crystal rotations through the same phi-interval but at different energies were recorded on each film. In order to separate spots of the same reflection, the image plate was shifted by 2 mm along the spindle after each change of the energy. Thus 13 peaks of a given hkl reflection are lying in a row (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). By this way synchrotron radiation could be used most efficiently.  </p></div>			</div>
