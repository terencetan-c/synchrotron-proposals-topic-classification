Bauer, E. Wintersberger,* J. Novak,* Institut für Halbleiter-und Festkörperphysik Johannes Kepler Universität Linz Altenbergerstr. 69 A-4040 Linz Austria Report:</p><p>ST Microelectronics have invented a method for growing thick Ge buffers of constant composition exhibiting a threading dislocation (TD) density of 10 8 cm -2 and a root-mean-square roughnes of about 0.5 nm. Therefore, the quality of their Ge buffers is sufficient for devices. The samples measured during the experiment Si923 can be considered as an application for this ST Microelectronics buffers. Both samples are GaAs buffers grown on a ST Microelectronics Ge buffer deposited on a Si substrate. The GaAs buffers are intended to serve as substrates for future InGaAs/GaAs quantum wells. The samples were grown at the Laboratoire de Photonique et de Nanostructures in Marcoussis.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the structure of the two samples (namely ge121 and ge152) measured during this experiment. The ALE layer between the Ge and the GaAs buffer layer should avoid the formation of anti phase boundaries. Our aim was to investigate the buried Ge/GaAs interface being not accessible via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other surface sensitive methods but via x-ray reflectivity (XRR). First experiments where done at our lab at the university of Linz using a 8 keV x-ray tube as a source. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows a typical result of such a XRR measurement at 8 keV. Obvioulsy there are no fringes from the Ge/GaAs interface visible, and therefore, no information about the buried interface could be obtained from this first measurements. The reason for this is quite simple if one takes the energy dependece of the optical constants of Ge and GaAs into account. At an energy of 8 keV these constants are nearly equal for Ga and GaAs and therefore no constrast in the index of refraction could be achieved between the two materials. However, at an energy of 10.3 keV, near the Ga edge, the optical constants of Ge and GaAs differ sufficiently from each other giving rise to a reasonable contrast between GaAs and Ge. Since this energy cannot be achieved by common laboratory souces the measurements have been repeated at the anomalous scattering beamline ID01.</p><p>During our experiment we changed the x-ray energy 10.3773 keV being exactly the Ga edge, to obtain maximum contrast. A typical result from the anomalous XRR measurements recorded at ID01 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The fringes due to the Ge/GaAs interface are clearly visible in the specular intensity. For every sample the x-ray reflectivity was recorded in three 90 degree azimuths to obtain information on the homogenety of the samples. In addition to a radial scan we also performed an angular scan to obtain more information on the distribution of the diffusely scatterd intensity. A position sensitive detector (PSD) was used for recording the data, providing the complete information needed for data postprocessing (specular and diffuse intensity). The recorded data was corrected with respect to the diffuse background and normalized to the primary beam intensity. After this a fitting program has been used to determine the net thickness of the GaAs layers, i.e., d LTB . It turned out that for one sample (ge152) the specular reflectivity and therefore d LTB depends on the azimuth. We could show that this comes from an inhomogenous thickness distribution over the sample area. Finally, we can conclude that anomalous XRR is a powerfull tool for the investigation of burried Ge/GaAs interfaces. It was possible to fit the layer thicknesses of the GaAs layer on top of the Ge buffer. However, further measurements should be made to improve the method and the fitting model has to be further developed for a precise determination of the interface roughness and the relative electron density.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The structure of sample ge121 and ge152. d LTB is the net thicknes of the low temperature buffer layer and the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) layer.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,41.22,462.24,142.20,130.14" type="bitmap" /></figure>
