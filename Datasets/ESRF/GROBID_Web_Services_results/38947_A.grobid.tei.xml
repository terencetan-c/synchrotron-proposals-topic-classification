<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment, we have investigated the magnetism on both the Co and Ca sites by means of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) technique. The CaCo 2 compound was synthesized from the initial mixture of components in a high-pressure chamber of the Toroid type at a 8.0GPa pressure and under heating to the melting point. Heating was effected by current passage through the sample placed within a tube made of a potassium chloride single crystal. Importantly, this metastable high-pressure phase remains intact under normal conditions for a long time (the stablest of them, CaCo 2 , can be kept for several months). CaCo 2 is a ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 528K. The macroscopic magnetic moment at T=4.2K in a 0.9Tesla external magnetic field is 3.4 µB/f.u. XMCD experiments were performed on different polycrystalline samples (that have been prepared on different time) to ensure that the observed XAS and XMCD signals are not contaminated from aging effects . In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we show the Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra and the corresponding XMCD spectra recorded at 290K and under 6Tesla.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we show the XAS and XMCD spectra recorded at the Ca K-edge under the same experimental condition. The Ca K-edge presents a strong pre-edge feature were the maximum XMCD signal is located. A similar pre-edge feature is also seen in the Co Kedge.The XMCD signal intensity is as small as 6.10 -3 with respect of the edge jump of unity.</p><p>We can observe a strong similarity between the XMCD signal of Ca and Co that have the same signal sign but three times larger in amplitude. The XMCD signal measured at the Ca K-edge will clearly demonstrate that 4p states of Ca are polarized via hybridization with 4p-3d shell of the Co transition metals. Indeed, due to the 4p(Co)-4p(Ca) hybridization, an induced polarization at the Ca K-edge was suspected and now observed.</p><p>Fully relativistic LMTO calculations revealed a moment per Co atom in CaCo 2 close to a moment of pure Co that is quantitative good agreement with the results obtained by SQUID.</p><p>Moreover, a ferrimagnetic ordering of the sublattices with a small total induced negative moment on Ca up to ~ -0.20µB was obtained. Further calculations are under way to understand the presence of splittings in the XMCD signal at the Co and Ca K-edge and to simulate the XMCD signal to reveal the possible presence of quadrupolar transitions.
