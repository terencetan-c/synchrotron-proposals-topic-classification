<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Strongly antiferromagnetically (a.f) coupled Co/Cu multilayers grown by magnetron sputering exhibit very different magneto-transport behaviour when the layers and interfaces are contaminated with oxygen. Those contaminated at the interfaces showed no change in the Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) while the GMR falls dramatically in those where the contamination was mid-way through the layer. The aim of the work reported here was to study Co/Ru multilayers, which are known to exhibit strong a.f. coupling, and to attempt to relate variations in the magnetotransport behaviour to any changes in interface morphology and conformality or bulk crystallinity on contamination.</p><p>A series of off-specular, longitudinal diffuse scatter measurements as a function of bilayer number for the Co/Ru samples grown at the first AF coupling peak are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>. For low bilayer numbers the offspecular scan exhibits the same periodic features as the specular, figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The scatter at a momentum transfer vector corresponding to a Bragg peak position is particularly sensitive to the interface morphology within the bilayer. The degree of interface conformality within the bilayer determines how far this coherent scatter extends into reciprocal space. Interface roughness that is highly correlated in nature across the bilayer repeat thickness will generate a diffuse, off-specular, Bragg peak in addition to the specular peak. The presence of off-specular interference fringes, with a period corresponding to the total stack thickness, demonstrate that this conformality extends throughout the whole multilayer stack.</p><p>For the maximum bilayer number the off-specular Bragg peak remains but the interference fringes disappear as conformality between the top and bottom layer is lost. Such a trend has been observed previously in Co/Pt <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> where it was possible to define an out-of-plane length scale for conformal growth beyond which no interference fringes were observed in the off-specular scatter. A measure of the FWHM of the specular and off-specular Bragg peak with increasing bilayer number also shows the point at which conformality is lost, figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The specular Bragg peak becomes systematically sharper with increasing layer number as the number of coherently scattering interfaces increases. The offspecular Bragg peak follows the same trend as long as conformality is retained across the entire stack. For the maximum stack thickness the off-specular FWHM begins to diverge from that of the specular, indicating that the stack thickness has exceeded the vertical length scale for conformal growth which is of the order of 300 to 400Ã… in these samples.</p><p>0.1 0.2 6 8 10 12 specular off-specular bilayer number Bragg peak FWHM (degrees) 0.1 1 10 1 3 13 bilayers 5 bilayers sample angle (degrees)</p><p>Normalised intensity (arb. units)</p><p>Modelling of the specular reflectivity shows that the samples are grown at the correct spacer layer thickness to maintain a constant coupling strength. Initial measurements on the transverse diffuse scatter for the 5 and 13 bilayer samples would suggest that the interface roughness is greater in the 13 bilayer sample but that the roughness is highly correlated and of comparable lateral correlation length in both samples, figure 4. The profile of the diffuse scatter would also suggest the fractal parameter does not change with increasing layer number.</p><p>Analysis is continuing as to whether the loss of interface roughness conformality with increasing bilayer number observed here is a feature of both the gas contaminated and clean samples. All samples have a spacer thickness matching that of the intended a.f coupling fraction so it is entirely possible that the variation in the GMR is driven by anomalies in the interface profile. All samples were found to be poorly textured with no apparent differences in the bulk crystalline properties.  Figure 2. Specular and offspecular for the 7 bilayer sample Figure 3.
