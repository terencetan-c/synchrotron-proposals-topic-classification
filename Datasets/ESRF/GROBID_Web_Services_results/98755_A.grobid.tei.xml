<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to acquire XAS spectra of a Fe-N-C catalyst based on Fe Phtalocyanine <ref type="bibr">(FePC)</ref> during pyrolisis at Fe k-edge. The objective was to unravel Fe-N-C evolution during the heat treatment, and to correlate it with changes in electrocatalyst performances. The experiment was divided in two series of measurements:</p><p>1) In-situ XAS acquisitions of the sample during pyrolisis (performed during daytime); 2) Ex-situ XAS acquisitions of Fe-N-C samples previoulsy heattreated in our labs (performed during nighttime). To perform in-situ heating, we used the Microtomo gas flow cell designed and produced by the experimental pool. The cell was able to reach 900°C by specifications. A first part of the experiment was devoted to the definition of the best conditions do achieve highter temperature using an Ar/H2 gas mixture (95%/5%). A fter a series of tests in which we changed the heating conditions, fluxes and loadings, we managed to reach a maximum temperature of about 650°C. which was partly insufficient for the full definition of the changes on the FeNC centers (we had to reach at least 800°C, we saw that an important change in the electrochemical behaviour was visible between 600 and 800°C. In-situ acquisitions were performed for temperature steps, in which the temperature was left constant for about 3 hours for each step. A number of acquisitions was performed on the same formulation in order to be sure of the reproducibility of the results. We were able to track important changes in the XAS spectra: a) Inside the single ex-situ series (from 25°C to 1000°C, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>); b) Inside the in-situ series (from 25°C to 650°C, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>); c) Between the ex-situ and in-situ series d) We were able to determine also a shifting towards the ex-situ spectra of the samples subjected to the in-situ treatment after a period of time in air. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -XANES of the ex-situ samples, highlighting the trends in change of the spectrum</figDesc><graphic coords="1,242.40,545.14,333.60,229.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
