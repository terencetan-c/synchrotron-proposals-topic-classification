<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>FeGe shows a spiral magnetic ordering below ≈ 278 K. While at the temperatures of ~ 211 -245 K the magnetic spirals alter the propagation direction from [100] to <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref>. The crystal structure of FeGe despite being cubic is of rather low symmetry -it belongs to an unusual B20 type (space group P2 1 3, Z = 4), in which each species has sevenfold coordination. The atomic positions in FeGe are slightly removed from the ideal structure, in which the iron and germanium both occupy 4a (U, U, U) sites with U = ±0.15451. Recent studies have shown the presence of a magnetic contribution to the specific heat <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>In order to study the structural variation of FeGe, which is expected to accompany the changes of the magnetic structure in the range of ~ 100 -300 K, powder sample of FeGe was placed into 0.3 mm diameter capillary for x-ray diffraction experiment. The wavelength of xray radiation was as small as 0.18934 A according to the calibration with the help of Si standard (NIST 640C).</p><p>The fitting of x-ray diffraction patterns performed by Fullprof Suit Software package resulted in a good agreement of the experimental and theoretical diffractograms as exemplified in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (conventional Rielveld R-factors: R p ≈4%, R wp ≈4%).  The fitting of the set of diffractograms at a number of temperatures provided the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. It does not show any significant peculiarities. The approximation of this dependence to the room temperature give the lattice parameter of ~ 4.698 Å, that is close to the previously obtained values (4.6995(2) Å [1], 4.700 Å [2], 4.70585(4) Å our measurements at BM25).</p><p>The atomic position parameter of Fe-atoms (U_Fe) as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. There are no drastic changes of this parameter in the studied temperature range, rather it remains constant within the experimental error. It means that at least in the temperature range corresponding to the change of the magnetic spiral propagation direction (211 -245 K) the crystal structure does not rearrange particularly. The data obtained at higher temperatures is characterized by a larger experimental error and does not allow to evaluate the temperature dependence of U_Fe. The further work is in progress.</p><p>[1] H. Wilhelm, A.O. Leonov, U.K. <ref type="bibr">Rossler et al., Phys. Rev.
