<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We performed real-time and in situ investigations during growth and optical switching of molecular switches and organic semiconductors on gold surfaces. The first studied system was the molecular switch tetra-tertbutyl-azobenzene (TBA, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). The thin film structure has been analyzed with GIXD and XRR using a Dectris PILATUS 300K in combination with a scintillation counter.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> shows a GIXD reciprocal space map of a TBA thin film on polycrystalline gold. As is evident from the diffraction rings TBA crystallizes in a 3d powder-like structure with weak texturing. Regions with higher intensity correspond to preferred molecular orientations of TBA on gold. While weak texturing is visible and a) b) some of the molecules are lying flat as expected from the known monolayer strutcure, growth does not result in an ordered structure but in orientational disorder for thicker films. Measurements performed at ID10B showed that beam-damage is an issue that has to be looked at carefully for investigations of molecular switches with synchrotron radiation. The adsorption of molecules was hindered by long x-ray exposure during real-time growth studies. Also experiments using a laser for switching could not be followed in real time due to the sensitivity of molecules to beam exposure. Future experiments have to make use of a motorised stage to continuously move the sample through the beam so as to always measure on fresh sample spots. Part of the beamtime was used to study the organic semiconductor diindenoperylene (DIP) on gold. Real-time and in situ measurements during growth showed that the unit cell parameters are changing during growth.</p><p>The PILATUS 300K allowed us to monitor the positions of six Bragg reflections which made it possible to calculate the unit cell parameters at each point in time during growth (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>We have been able to make the first measurement of the complete unit cell as a function of growth time / film thickness for DIP molecules. While for film thicknesses below two monolayers the long axis of the molecules aligns nearly perpendicular to the substrate surface, the molecules tend to tilt a little bit as the film gets thicker (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Apart from the unit cell changes in the beginning of growth GIXD scans of the DIP film after growth revealed two coexisting molecular structures, that we could identify as hightemperature and the low-temperature bulk phase both coexisting at a single temperature as a result of the kinetics of growth. Certain structural changes have been observed during heating, indicating a negative thermal expansion coefficient for the c-parameter (long axis of the unit cell), perpendicular to the substrate surface an interesting result that has similarly been observed for pentacene molecules. Theoretical modelling using molecular dynamics to explain these measured changes is currently under way in preparation of a publication.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent collaboration with the local contact Alexei Vorobiev which made this challenging experiment a success. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>investigations of the molecular switch TBA on gold and realtime x-ray studies of DIP growth on gold Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Stefan Kowarik 1 , *Peter Schäfer 1 , *Sebastian Bommel 1 , *Christopher Weber 1 1 Institut für Physik, Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Newtonstraße 15, 12489, Germany</figDesc></figure>
