<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>So far, we only investigated trabecular bone samples from a structural point of view using 3D x-ray absorption computed microtomography (CMT). The purpose of this new experiment was to perform quantitative measurements of bone mineral density, in terms of hydroxyapatite concentration, using CMT.</p><p>The microtomography set-up was similar to the one which we used to image human vertebrae samples (proposal LS382), it included a rotation stage to scan the sample in the monochromatic beam and a CCD based 2D detector. The detector consisted of a high resolution Gd202S:Tb screen converting X-rays to light, light optics performing an optical magnification of 2.86 and the FRELON CCD camera. The pixel size in the image was 6.65 l.tm.</p><p>The first step of the experiment consisted in calibrating the acquisition set-up and the tomographic reconstruction program. The calibration measurements were performed on phantoms with different concentrations in hydroxyapatite (from 50 mg/cc to 1500 mg/cc). The linear attenuation coefficient of the phantoms was first measured at 20keV and 35keV and is plotted as a function of hydroxyapatite concentration in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Four phantoms (50 mg/cc, 150 mg/cc, 500 mg/cc and 1500 mg/cc) were imaged in three dimensions using CMT. 2D slices of two different samples are presented in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. These phantoms which are conventionally used for the calibration of medical scanners with coarser spatial resolution turned out to be very inhomogeneous at the scale of our imaging system because they contained air bubbles and the dimensions of some hydroxyapatite particles were more than 300 j.tm. Therefore, an average linear attenuation coefficient was calculated on the whole reconstructed volume to calibrate the tomographic reconstruction program.</p><p>A foetus vertebra was then scanned using the same set-up at 20 keV and 35 keV. A 3D image was reconstructed at each energy and we are currently working on deriving the hydroxyapatite concentration within the sample from those images. The same 2D slice of the vertebra at each energy is presented in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
