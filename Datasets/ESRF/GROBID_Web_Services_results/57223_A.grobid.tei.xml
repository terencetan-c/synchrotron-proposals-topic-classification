<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>For this experiment we planned to measure Co-octaethylporphyrin (OEP) molecules on a HOPG substrate and correlate the large orbital moment which was observed in soft-x-ray XMCD measurements to the local structure of the Co by (surface) EXAFS and XMCD. For that a deposition chamber was brought to the ESRF from Duisburg and mounted to beamline ID12. Several layers of molecules were then evaporated onto HOPG which was fixed to the coldfinger of the cryostat. The cryostat was then introduced into the 6T Oxford magnet. This deposition corresponds to a submonolayer coverage of Co as every molecule contains just one Co atom, we planned to use the energy-resolved detector which was mounted on the magnet from the other side under a fixed angle. Unfortunately the geometry dictated by the experiment did not allow us to detect the Co K-edge signal because it was dominated by a diffraction peak of the HOPG substrate. Even an Fe filter did not shield the detector sufficiently as it created a large additional artefact (background?) signal in the detector. In  order to be successful for this experiment, either the measurement geometry needs to be changed or another substrate has to be used which avoids a diffraction peak in this direction. In order to measure the Co OEP molecules despite these difficulties we pressed a pellet from the molecule powder. In the following extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), xray near edge structure (XANES) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) were recorded at the Co K-edge. Analysis of the Co EXAFS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, bottom) allowed us to verify a planar configuration of the Co within the molecule which was also observed in the Co OEP molecules on surfaces <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The detailed analysis of the spectra by ab initio calcuations (FEFF9 code) is currently performed.</p><p>The XANES (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, top) reveals a very distinct structure at the pre-edge and rising edge which can be attributed to orbitals in Co along different orientations which are visible in all spectra due to the rather arbitrary orientation of the molecules in the pellet. These distinct features are also observed in the the XMCD spectra. Magnetic fielddependent measurements have been carried out at the photon-energy of the Co pre-edge. They show a field dependence which differs from a simple Brillouin-like behavior. A detailed analysis is ongoing.</p><p>To measure the Co OEP molecules in an oriented way we, dispersed them in solution and prepared a thin layer by drop-casting.</p><p>The respective XANES and XMCD spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The different spectral shape for 15° and 90° incident angle of the x-rays indicates that the molecules are oriented parallel on the Si substrate for this multilayer coverage. Despite the multilayer coverage of the Co-OEP molecules on Si, many spectra had to be recorded in order to enhance signal-tonoise ratio of the XMCD spectra. Further careful analysis of the individual spectra is under way. For further understanding theoretical modelling and calculation of the spectra will be performed.</p></div>
