<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We are engaged in a project which aims to optimizing the properties of niobium for its use in radiofrequency cavities, by controlled annealing procedures in different gas environments. The incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen in the Nb lattice and its influence on carbide and hydride formation has been identified as a key ingredient. The aim of this experiment was to locally map the surface structure of individual grains and grain boundaries of niobium, using (sub-)micron resolution. Samples, pre-characterized concerning the exact grain shape and orientation in selected marked areas, were used. The initial proposal HC-4065 was granted beamtime and took place under pandemic measures as a remote experiment. Unfortunately, during that experiment the annealing step didn't work. The present proposal was a resubmission, based on the previous experimental difficulties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results</head><p>Polished polycrystalline crystals were characterized by SEM and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) at Desy Nanolab. These microscopy techniques resulted in maps of grain orientation and designated areas marked by platinum. These samples were mounted on the ID01 diffractometer and the designated areas were found back by using the optical microscope and by mapping out the samples using the specularly reflected beam: due to absorption of the beam through the Pt markers, there is a relatively good intensity contrast. The results of correlating the EBSD maps with the Kmaps recorded at the beamline are summarized in Fig 1 . There are also clear changes in the maps before and after the annealing. Complete XRR curves at the selected positions, approximately 10, yield very good data for detailed fitting of electron density profiles, as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for the 213 oriented grain. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>A very successful experiment has been performed. The preparation of the markers, finding them back on the beamline and performing local XRR before and after annealing all worked. Currently we are finalizing the data analysis and summarizing the results for a publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
