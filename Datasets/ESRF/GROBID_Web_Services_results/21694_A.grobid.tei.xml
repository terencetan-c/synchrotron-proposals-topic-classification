<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This project was designed to collect data from a number of proteins connected with the function of Photosystem II. The proteins that measurements were made on were:</p><p>1. The reaction center of Photosystem II (RCII) from spinach, dimeric form. RCII is a large membrane bound pigment protein complex (MW~300kDa). We have previously obtained crystals of a monomeric form of theis complex which diffracted to 6.5Å (at ESRF). In this experiment, isolated and purified a new dimeric form of RCII, which crystllized under different conditions.</p><p>The crystals were small (&gt;0.1 mm), and we were not able to obtain a diffraction pattern on our inhouse diffractometer. We were succesful in our attempts at ESRF to mount the crystals after a breif treatment in silicon oil, the crystals appeared to freeze well, however the diffraction was poor, ~15Å at best. However, the experiment showed the feasability of using the dimeric form, which we are now working on to improve.</p><p>2. Phycocyanin and allophycocyanin from Synechococcus vulcanus. We have previously collected data to 1.5Å on phycocyanin (at CHESS). We attempted to obtain higher resolution diffraction, however none of the crystals diffracted better. We have also isolated allophycocyanin and obtained small crystals, which did not diffract.</p><p>3. The MntC solute binding protein, a manganese transport protein from Synechocystis PCC sp.6803. This protein was crystallized after overexpression. The crystals diffracted to 2.6Å, and we obtained a full data set to 2.8Å (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This has been used for structure determination using molecular replacement (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and a preliminary report has been accepted for publication in Acta Crystallographica D.</p></div>
