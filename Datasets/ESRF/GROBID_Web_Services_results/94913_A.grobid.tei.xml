<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives and expected results:</head><p>The main objective of this study was to determine the valance of Uranium and Thorium contained in silicate glasses as tracers (600-6000 ppm) synthesized previously at highly reducing conditions relevant to those that prevailed in the Early Earth's interior. This knowledge is crucial to interpret their experimentally observed distribution behaviours between a silicate melt and a metal melt <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and to deduce their abundances in the Earth's mantle and core <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. In order to investigate if the valence state changes of U and Th are at the origin of the observed distribution behaviour we performed HERFD-XANES measurements complemented with PFY measurements at their L3-edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusion of the study:</head><p>For U L3 HERFD-XANES measurements (incoming energy ~17.1 keV) the beamline FAME-UHD (BM16) was operating using a Si(220) double-crystal monochromator combined with a set of two Rh coated harmonic rejection mirrors inclined to 3 mrad. The beam was focused in vertical and horizontal to a size of 150*200 μm 2 , which was necessary to probe only the signal from the silicate glass parts, which have typical dimensions of 0.5*0.5 mm 2 . A crystal analyser spectrometer (CAS) with a Roland radius of 1 m was employed. Samples were placed with an angle of 45 ° to the incoming beam. The CAS was equipped with six Ge(777) crystals aligned to a Bragg's angle of 77.4° degree allowing a high energy resolution (~3 eV) at the emission energy of U Lα1 13.615 keV. A digital camera equipped with a microfocus objective was employed to identify the position of the beam on the samples. We performed U L3-edge HERFD-XANES measurements on 10 glass samples synthesised at different oxygen fugacities (fO2 = -5.25, -5.13, -4.32, -4.13, -1.9, -1.67, -1.61, -1.54, -1.46, -1.05) but equivalent (P/T) conditions (1 GPa and 1773 K). For each sample at least 4 and up to 8 spectra were acquired between 17.0 to 17.5 keV (requiring each 30 minutes). A reference spectra of Y at its K-edge in transmission mode was regularly acquired in order to account for small energy drifts of the monochromator. An additional spectrum of a standard solution containing 2000 ppm of uranyl (UIV) was acquired to ensure a tight calibration of the white line and first XANES peak maximum to the valance of U. Finally, for 0.5 mm the sample with the highest content of Uranium (6000 ppm) test EXAFS spectra were acquired up to a k-range of 8 Å -1 . No HERFD data were obtained for Th due to time-consuming CAS changes required and because the priority was given to U as a sensitive to fO2 (see below).</p><p>The acquired HERFD-XANES spectra were of very high quality in terms of signal to noise ratio and suppressions of the background signal (flat pre-edge line) (Fig2. a,b). The EXAFS signal was however affected by a high-noise signal already after a k-range of 6 Å -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>)    The acquired U L3 edge HERFD-XANES data from the samples showed a clear variation of the edge and first XANES peak maximum energy position (FXPM) as a function of fO2. The total energy shift of the FXP with varying fO2 was found to equal ΔEFXP= 2.1 eV. This observation is in line with the experimentally observed change in partitioning behaviour and expected changes in U valence state.</p><p>However, previous studies on the FXPM variation of the U L3-edge with its valence revealed that the FXPM does not vary linearly with the valance if ligands are differing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). L3-edge measurements are indeed highly affected by the nature and sort of ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>.</p><p>Our glass compositions are very simply in terms of chemistry (SiO2, 50.37 wt.%, MgO 34.86 wt.%, Al2O3 2.60 wt.%, FeO 7.50 wt.%, CaO 2.88 wt.%, K2O 0.30 wt.%) and it would be unlikely that another ligand than oxygen would coordinate U. We therefore believe that our acquired data can be aligned to our reference values of Uranium oxygen compounds (red dots). This would indicate a shift from U 4+ at high fO2 towards U 3+ at low fO2. However, the results are still ambiguous in terms of mix-valance states, which are difficult to assess from the present measurements alone. FDMNES calculations are currently in progress in order to extract information on the structural envionement (ligands, bond length) from the experimental HERFD-XANES data and to confirm the hypothesis of valence change. The present HERFD-XANES data were complemented with partial fluorescence yield measurements at U and Th L3edges at the beamline BM23 through inhouse research in order to investigate qualitatively if Th valence is affected by fO2 variation. For these measurements the beamline was operating with a Si(111) monochormator combined with a KB-system comprised of two Pt coated mirrors inclined to 3 mrad for harmonic rejection and beam focusing to 3*3 μm 2 . These measurements revealed that Th valance state is unaffected by fO2 variations as there was no detectable shift of the spectra with fO2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>). In the U XANES data (PFY) acquired in the same samples, we could detect a shift to lower energy values of the FXPM similar to observations in the L3 U HERFD-XANES data from FAME-UHD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>). Justification and comments about the use of beam time: The beamtime has been fully exploited and high-aqility HERFD-XANES measurments have been performed on highly diluted and sub-milimetric samples. Data have been analysed in terms of U valance state varaition, indicating a reduction. A clear distinction of mixed U valance states and the valance of Th requires additional M4-edge measurments [4,5]. Publication(s): A publication is in progress, but requires additional M4-edge measurements to identify unambiguously mixed valance states in U and the valance of Th [4,5]. Beamtime proposals have been send for this purposes in this spring call 2021.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
