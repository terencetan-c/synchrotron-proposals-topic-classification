<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Traditional models for the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits assume that aqueous fluids transported the metals. This view has recently been challenged by new observations showing that gold and copper are preferentially enriched in vapors coexisting with salty aqueous fluids in some important deposits. We aim to measure experimentally the partitioning of Cu, Au and Te between solid, fluid and vapour at temperatures typical for natural ore deposits (350-600˚C). By improving our understanding of metal transport within the Earth's crust, these data will lead to improved models and technologies for exploring and processing base and precious metals.</p><p>The experiment had two main objectives:</p><p>(1) Proof of concept for the suitably of a new laser-drilled diamond anvil (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) for the experimental study of liquid-vapour and solid-vapour partitioning of transition metals in magmatic hydrothermal conditions (i.e. up to 600˚C, 4 kbar).</p><p>(2) Obtain the first experimental measurement for liquid vapour partioning of Cu(I) under magmatic-hydrothermal conditions.</p><p>We successfully showed that the drilled diamond are suitable of this work (see <ref type="bibr">Figs. 2a,</ref><ref type="bibr">b)</ref>, and hence fullfilled objective (1). This took about 6 shifts, because of the complexity of the experimental setup, and some issue with scattering from the Cucontaminated hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). A further 3 shifts were lost due to problems with the beam (beam dropped off for 6 hours, and it took about a day to get the monochromator to work reliably again).</p><p>After establishing the methodology and measuring a standard copper solution (homogeneous solution with know copper concentration), we loaded the first 'real' sample, consisting of water, a NaCl crystal, and a CuCl crystal. Unfortunately, due to a major failure of the experimental set-up, we where not able to collect "real" data under geologically relevant situations. A gas flow controller failed, cutting the supply of the reducing gas that was protecting the heater, the diamond and the Re-gasket.</p><p>Because the set-up did not allow for optical observation during x-ray collection, we were not aware of the problem. By the time the problem was identified, the electrical system in the cell had been oxidised, and a diamond had broken down probably due to the oxidation of graphite lining the laser-drilled groove. It would have taken 24 hours to replace the diamond and electrical system, but we had only 24 hours of beam-time left at that stage. We spent the remaining time collecting XANES spectra of standard Cu(I) and Cu(II) solutions loaded in capillaries.</p><p>This was our first contact with a 3 rd generator beam-line, and the first opportunity to test a complex piece of equipment. We have established the soundness of the approach, and plan to improve the design to ensure success at the next experiment.</p><p>In particular, we have built a second cell (cost ~AU$25,000), to minimise sample loading time and to suppress the risk associated with a major failure of a cell. We are also working on using a nuclear microprobe to perform preliminary experiments.</p><p>In 2004 we had the opportunity to use the large volume X-ray absorption cell developped by Jean-Louis Hazemann and his team at FAME (exp. ME1137), and we have shifted our emphasis towards collecting high quality x-ray absorption data using this cell to understand Cu speciation in brines and low-density supercritical fluids.</p><p>Based on this understanding, we plan to revisit the hydrothermal diamond anvil cell technology in near future.

(a) Transmission signal, (b) Cu Kα; the triangle is the groove (low absorpion by diamond); the weak signal on the right is from the reservoir away from the groove (high absorption). The large copper signal on the top is due to contamination of the cement used to seal the diamond by copper solution (but it does not contribute to the background on the sample).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
