<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results</head><p>The aim of this work was to study the effect of processing parameters on the reaction kinetics of Fe-Al intermetallics. The processing strategy consists in infiltrating molten Al or Al alloy into a porous Fe-based preform to produce Fe-Al intermetallics. X-ray radiography (XR) is combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) to bring information about reaction velocity and reaction front between molten Al and solid Fe. Reaction velocity and front propagation will be evaluated by image analysis of XR, while XRD data will be used for the analysis of type and amount of the formed phases during post-infiltration heating. In addition, the use of laboratory X-ray computed tomography (XCT) will provide detailed information about the microstructure of the infiltrated samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results &amp; conclusions</head><p>Two porous preforms with different void sizes and content were selected for investiagtion, namely selective laser melting (SLM) and Kochanek (KE). In situ infiltration of Al melt into Fe preform were performed combining radiography and diffraction measurements where a dedicated furnace was used. The energy was set to 50 keV and beam size to 4x4 mm. Pilatus area detector was used for XRD measurements while PCO edge camera was used for XR imaging. The in situ infiltration experiments were performed under argon atmosphere. SLM and KE samples (10x10x1.5 mm 3 ) were used. The Fe preform is placed in the lower part of the crucible inside the furnace while the Al plate is mounted above the Fe preform. After heating, the Al melt is injected into the porous Fe preform be means of a pneumatic actuator. The experiments were carried out at ID15A beamline where the temporal and spatial resolutions were a crucial factor for choosing this beamline. The analysis of the obtained data is not completed yet. Preliminary observations of one selected successful infiltration are reported below.</p><p>Radiographies and XRD patterns were recorded during the infiltration experiments. An important result for this study was the measurement of a clear evolution of the Debye-scherrer rings from the beginning of the experiment until full infiltration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This confirms the formation of new phases and that the infiltration is reactive. In addition, the obtained radiographies show changes in the microstructure although the Al was invisible. The difference in image contrast is an indication of the formation of new phases (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). A complete analysis of the radiography images will be performed by making the difference of 2 consecutive images to extract quantitaive information of the infiltration and reaction process.  Post-mortem analysis of the infiltrated sample by tomography gives more details about the reactive infiltration as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The tomographic observations allowed to distinguish different phases where in particular, on top of sample in direct contact with the molten Al, a needle-like structure was observed. More details with different intensity contrasts are visible which confirmes the existence of new phases. Some parts with light contrast are also visible which are attributed to intermetalics with higher Fe contents or pure Fe grains (different contrast even in the "lighter" phases is observed) that didn't react with Al or where Al didn't reach. EBSD analysis is planned to identify precisely the formed phases to fully characterize the infiltrated material. In summary, this experiment was very succeesful and demonstrates the importance of XR and XRD as powerful tools for observing infiltration and reaction process in situ. Full analysis of the data is in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: The evolution of XRD patterns during infiltration of Al melt into KE sample; (a) before, (b) during and (c) after infiltration.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.95,150.10,526.55,150.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
