<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results:</head><p>The initial aim of the experiments was to investigate Selenium high temperature partitioning between vapor and silicate melts to model chalcogenes (S, Se, Te) magmatic degassing. Unfortunately, the measurements required a new autoclave for in situ XAS measurements up to 1300 °C and 300 MPa that was not delivered in time for the experiments. Instead, I decided to investigate the effect of pH, fO 2 and different metals (Fe, Cu, Mn) on the aqueous and gaseous speciation of Se up to 425 °C at 30 MPa. The experiments will constitute a theoretical framework for a future study of Se high-temperature partitioning between vapor and silicate melts. Furthermore, while S/Se signature of magmatic sulfides (MS) are commonly used to assess the origin of sulfide saturation in Ni-Cu-PGE deposits (ie., is S saturation due to mantellic pre-enrichment or input through crustal assimilation within the crust?), it has been suggested that the hydrothermal alteration of the MS by low-temperature (T &lt; 300 °C) oxidizing fluids could significantly complicate the interpretation of the S/Se signature [1]. Yet, little is known about the aqueous speciation of Selenium at T &gt; 25 °C, and especially about the effect of pH and fO 2 . Thermodynamic model by [2]  suggests that at 300 °C reduced Se(-II) remains the dominant oxidation state of Se in aqueous fluids up to the CuO/Cu 2 O buffer. Thus, hydroselenides complexes should dominate metal complexation. Our experimental results contradict those conclusions, pointing to a significant underestimation of the stability of Se(IV) species (SeO 3 2-or HSeO 3 -) at high temperature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and conclusions of the study:</head><p>The experiments were conducted in the high temperature autoclave dedicated to in situ X-Ray absorption spectroscopy of hydrothermal fluids available on the BM30-B beamline <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. XAS spectra collected around the Se K-edge (12.6578 keV) in transmission and fluorescence modes from 25 to 425 °C at 30 MPa were used to determine both the speciation and the solubility of Se in the high temperature fluids, using similar technique as described in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The effect of increasing temperature on the speciation of a 0.1m Se solution were first investigated in pure H 2 O, 0.1m HCl, 0.1m NaOH and 0.1m H 2 O 2 . Then, we used mineral fO 2 buffers to vary the redox conditions within the experimental load (Fe/FeO, MnO/Mn 3 O 4 , Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 and CuO/Cu 2 Oincreasingly oxidizing). All solutions have an initial speciation dominated by Se(IV). The XANES spectra have been used to fingerprint the oxidation state of Se at increasing temperature (E0 for Se0 and Se(IV) are 12658 and 12662 eV, respectively). In unbuffered solutions, we observe a significant decrease of Se aqueous concentration at 300 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which is related to the formation of Se 0 particules by reduction of the Se(IV). However, up to 1000 ppm Se is found to remain in solution as Se(IV) up to 350 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Potential reduction of Se(IV) due to the beam was also investigated, leaving an 0.1m Se solution at 300 °C for ~ 4h with the shutter closed and then collecting a fast XANES. It appears the formation of Se 0 is solely due to temeprature increase. Under controlled redox conditions, the presence of metals buffer Se aqueous concentrations under 1000-500 ppm, probably due to adsorption of Se on the mineral buffers. Se(IV) however remains the dominant high-temperature specie from the MnO/Mn 3 O 4 to the CuO/Cu 2 O buffer. At the reduced Fe/FeO buffer, only the precipitation of Se 0 is recorded. The most oxidized Se state (VI) is never observed. These results suggest that the stability field of Se(IV) can be extended to much lower fO 2 conditions than predicted by previous thermodynamic model <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and calls for revision of the thermodynamic database currently available to model metal-selenides precipitation. Additionnaly, XAS spectra have been acquired in low-density 'gas-like' phase at 425 °C and 30 MPa (ρ H2O = 0.188 g.cm -3 ). At these conditions, the concentrations of Se in the gas were below our detection limit in transmission, &lt;&lt; 100 ppm. Yet, XANES spectra collected in fluorescence mode (90 ° geometry) suggest that H2Se is the dominant gaseous specie at all investigated conditions, except under the most oxidized conditions (CuO/Cu 2 O buffer) where Se is present as SeO 2 . EXAFS analysis is currently being conducted to refine the aqueous structure at each P-T-X conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>The BM30-B beamline provides a unique environment for the in situ study of aqueous fluids at the P-T relevant to the hydrothermal precipitation of economic minerals/metals in shallow crustal environments <ref type="bibr">(200 &lt; T &lt; 600 °C and P &lt; 200 MPa)</ref>. Those data will constitute an important database for new experiments that aim at determining the high temperature speciation and partitioning of Se between vapor and silicate melts and model chalcogenes (S,Se,Te) magmatic degassing (follow-up proposal to be submitted in September 2017).</p></div>
