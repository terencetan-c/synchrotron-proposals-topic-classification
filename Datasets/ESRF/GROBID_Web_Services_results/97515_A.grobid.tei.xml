<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Within the allocated beamtime MA-5047 a series of operando hard X-ray abostion spectroscopy experiments within Li-ion batteries was conducted, investigating the transition metal (TM) dissolution from lithium-and manganese rich cathode active materias (LMR-CAMs). In specific, two different CAMs were compared; Namely, a cobalt containing LMR-NMC and a cobalt free LMR-NM were investigated. For this, a special operando XAS electrochemical cell designed by our group was employed (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Owing to the unique geometry of this cell, we were able to spectroscopically access and independently investigate both the anode electrode and the electrolyte within the separator. The implementation of a lithium reference electrode placed in a central position underneath the electrode stack enables to record the charge/discharge characteristics of the anode and cathode. The loadings of the electrodes were 5.3 mAh/gCAM on the cathode and 6.5 mAh/ggraphite on the anode and the cells were built with two glass fiber separators and filled with 100 µl electrolyte, LP57 (1 M LiPF6 in EC:EMC (3:7)). The first part of the experiments was focused on the activation of the investigated lithium-and manganese rich CAMs by charging the cell to a upper cut-off potential of 4.8 V vs. Li + /Li in a constant current (CC) charging step at a rate of C/10. This was followed with by a constant current discharge to 2.0 V vs. Li + /Li at a rate of C/2. After that two more cycles were conducted at a constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charge/discharge to 4.7 V vs. Li + /Li and 4.8 V vs. Li + /Li at a rate of C/2 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref> and <ref type="figure">e</ref>).</p><p>A sagittally focusing double crystal monochromator consisting of two Si 111 crystals was used to select the incoming energy and the beam was focused using Si coated mirrors; then, the beam was cut with slits to achieve a beam size of 5 μm in the horizontal dimension (i.e., along the thickness of the graphite electrode and the separator) and approximately 5 μm in the vertical dimension (i.e., along the width of the graphite electrode/the separator). These dimensions allow focusing the beam exclusively on either the separator, or the graphite electrode. As we are using hard X-rays in the energy range of 6-8 keV the probing depth of the XAS method is rather high on the order of ∼300 μm making the method bulk sensitive. Photon energies were calibrated using the first peak in the first derivative ofthe puremetal foils, which were measured in fluorescence before the operando study; background corrections of the spectra were carried out using the IFEFFIT software package. XANES was measured operando and alternated between two different positions in the cell (separator/electrolyte and graphite electrode) to obtain the total amount of dissolved transition metals from the respective CAMs. The acquisition time for each spectrum presented in this report was approximately 7 minutes.</p><p>To quantify the amount of dissolved TMs in the cell volume, the edge-jump (difference between post-and preedge region) was determined over the course of the experiments (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) by evaluating it with calibration curves for the respective TMs. These calibration curves were recorded prior to the operando measurments by preparing electrolyte solution with known amounts of the respective TM-TFSI salts, that were filled in the described cell setup with two galss-fibre separators only and then evaluating the edge-jump, corresponding to a specific concentration of the respective TMs (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). Both investigated materails show a comparable behaviour in regards to the dissolution of Ni 2+ and Mn 2+ from their bulk structure. The main onset for TM dissolution is reached once surpassing a cathode potential of 4.6 V vs. Li + /Li, wherby the time spent at the respective upper cut-off potentials seems to be specifically detrimental (expemplified by the constant voltage holds in cycle #2 and #3). At the end-of-test both materials show almost identical values regarding the weight percent (wt%) of TM-loss in regard to Ni 2+ and Mn 2+ , which is due to their highly comparable bulk-stochiometrie (not mentioned here). For the co-containing LMR-NMC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>) a large overestimation of the dissolved Co 2+ was observed, which, thus far, can't be explained. Overall, the optained results during the succesful beamtime MA-5047 at BM23 shown to be highly promising and layed the foundation for a ongoing investigation of the impact of parasitic reactions occuring at high operation voltages in Li-ion batteries containing LMR-CAMs. A fundamental understanding of those will enable selective approaches to tackle the limiting issues of these high-enegry materials to promote their implementation in Li-ion battery systems for high-energy applications. To conclude this stuy, the temperature dependence of the TM dissolution of state-of-the-art CAMs will be key subject of further operando hXAS studies (pending proposal MA-5685).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a) Schematic of the electrochemical cell for operando X-ray absortioption spectroscopic investigation used within this beamtime. b) exemplatory visualisation of the edge-jump method used for the quantification of transition metal ions within the electrochemical cell during cycling, that was applied within this study. c) Calibration measurments for the respective transition metals under investigatio (Ni 2+ in green, Co 2+ in purple and Mn 2+ in blue) determined by spiking electrolyte solutions (LP57 (1 M LiPF6 in EC:EMC (3:7))) with known concentrations of the respective TM-TFSI salts and measuring those electrolytes in the abovementioned operando cell within teo glassfibre separators. d) Potential profiles and respectively determined transition metal concentration measured within the graphite electrode for the Co-containing LMR-NMC. e) Potential profiles and respectively determined transition metal concentration measured within the graphite electrode for the Co-free LMR-NM.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,99.13,78.25,402.74,402.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
