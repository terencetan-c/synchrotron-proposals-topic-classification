<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The electrochemical deposition of metals is a subject of substantial basic research, motivated by current technologies as well as future applications. To obtain a better fundamental understanding of electrodeposition processes we studied metal electrode surfaces in-situ during deposition in aqueous electrolytes by grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS), using the homoepitaxial growth on Au(001) electrodes as an example. In the present work we performed the first GISAXS studies at the ID32 and even the first in-situ GISAXS measurements at the electrolyte/metal interface. Measurements were performed by using our established "hanging meniscus" transmission x-ray cell using a photon energy 22.5 keV. The scattered intensity was detected with a 2D pixel detector (Dectris Pilatus 300K-W), which was installed at a distance of 1.5 m behind the sample. To prevent detector saturation or damage due to the primary and specularly reflected beam, a beamstop consisting of a tantalum sheet (width 2 mm) was fixed directly in front of the detector. In the previous beamtime SI-1194 we determined kinetic growth behaviour of homoepitaxial growth on Au(001) in 0.1 M HCl + HAuCl 4 0.5 mM in dependence of the applied electrode potential and the electrodeposition rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Based on these results the evolution of the lateral surface structure during deposition for various potentials in the regime of multilayer growth from -0.10 to 0.15 V Ag/AgCl in steps of 0.05 V was investigated in the current work. As in our previous growth mode studies, the surface was smoothed at 0.60 V Ag/AgCl , i.e. in the regime of step flow growth, before the step to more negative potentials was performed. Frames were taken with a rate of 0.5 Hz. At 0.60 V Ag/AgCl , the two-dimensional intensity distribution on all detector frames was almost identical, showing scattering contributions from the static step arrangement resulting from the sample miscut (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">2a</ref>)). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the intensity distribution taken by a detector frame, with respect to the reciprocal space coordinates, illustrating the combined q x , q z -dependence in the vertical direction on the detector. To gain information about the lateral structures on the Au(001) surface, we transformed the detector frames into the reciprocal plane (q x , q y ) parallel to the sample surface (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The intensity distribution at 0.60 V Ag/AgCl (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>)) exhibits two characteristic streaks, which are perpendicular to each other, originating from kinked step edges parallel to [100] and [010] <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In multilayer growth the pattern exhibits an additional circular ring (radius q r ) around the speculary reflected beam (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>)). To separate the static scattering contributions from the diffuse scattering that belongs to the growing structures on the terraces (e.g. islands), we averaged over the detector frames taken at 0.60 V Ag/AgCl and substracted this contribution from the frames taken in the potential regime of multilayer growth. On the unreconstructed surface we found an isotropic surface morphology during multilayer growth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>)). Multilayer growth on (partially) reconstructed surfaces results in an anisotropic surface morphology where the intensity along the [110] and <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref> direction is significantly increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>)). This behaviour resembles that found in recent STM results of Vaz-Dominguez and Cuesta for much lower growth rates and layer-by-layer growth, which show that island growth on the unreconstructed parts of the surface occur predominantly along the "hex" stripes, leading to strongly anisotropic surface structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. At all potentials the preferential size L=2π/q r of lateral structures on the single crystal surface increases with applied potential and can be described by a well-defined power law (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Surprisingly, the exponent ν = 0.26 ± 0.02 is potential independent, i.e. independent of the potential dependent surface mobility as well as the crystalline structure of the electrode (reconstructed/unreconstructed surface). Furthermore, the diffusely scattered intensity on the ring increases with time, indicating increasing surface roughness during multilayer growth. The quantitative data analysis should allow to study the scaling behaviour of the rms-roughness σ(t) and is still in progress. These first in-situ GISAXS studies demonstrate the great potential of this technique for determining the time-dependent surface morphology during electrochemical growth. Data of this type can currently not be obtained by any other method, making in-situ GISAXS an exciting novel tool for clarifying fundamental open questions concerning these technologically important processes.
