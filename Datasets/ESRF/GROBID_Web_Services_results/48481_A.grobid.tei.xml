<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remarks:</head><p>During our experiment period, we have studied the molecular-scale speciation of As in selected natural coloids samples obtained from metal(loid)s contaminated soil samples aiming to assess the role of soil natural colloidal particles as nanovectores of toxic elements in the contamination process of the soil-water system (Report 1). In addition, we could perform suplementary studies of As speciation in two bulk soil samples aiming to complete our previous study (EC649 and corresponding experimental report) on the geochemical behaviour and distribution of As in contaminated soils and to elucidate the role of preferential water flow phenomena on their sorption mechanisms in the soil (Report 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report 1:</head><p>Arsenic associated with colloidal particles is an important vector for As migration in contaminated soils. Using Asymmetric-Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AsFlFFF) coupled to an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), we determined the As distribution as a function of the particle size of the colloidal fraction of soils samples. The samples were collected from stained preferential flow paths and bulk soil samples, impacted by a mine waste. Physical and chemical properties of the colloids were also determined using X-ray-diffraction, SEM and TEM. Arsenic and Fe speciation in the colloidal fraction was characterized using X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy techniques. Preliminary results indicated that more than 47% of the As mobilized in the preferential flow paths (70.5 mg/L) was associated with the colloidal fraction of the soil. Instead, 5% (2 mg/L) of the mobile As in the bulk samples of the soil was colloidal As. Common to both samples, a similar fractogram (1-1000 nm) was obtained for As, Fe and Al, suggesting an association of As with Fe and/or Al colloidal particles. As XAS analysis of the colloidal fractions (&gt;10 nm) of the soil samples, indicated As adsorption on ferrihydrite as the main As-colloid retention mechanism. The presence of Fe oxyhydroxides in addition to phyllosilicates was also showed by Fe X-ray absorption analysis. These results show the important role of Fe-oxyhydroxides as nanovectors of colloidal As in preferential flow paths and bulk samples of a contaminated soil.</p><p>During our experiment, As and Fe k-edge XAS spectra were measured on bending-magnet BM25A beamline (SpLine) (6 GeV, 100 mA, Si(111) monochromator crystals) in fluorescence mode using a 13element Si(Li) solid state detector with the sample at room temperature (RT). The samples corresponded to selected natural colloidal soil samples obtained from a contaminated scenario located in Madrid province (Spain). The samples were same ones used during the beamtime assigned under the EC-822 proposal. Because unconclusive XANES spectra were obtained by then (see report Cod EC-822 and Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> in that report), additional X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis was perfomed. Arsenic and Fe spectra were analyzed using the programs Athena (Ravel and Newville, 2005) for linear combination fits. Background was subtracted using a linear fit through the pre-edge region and the Autobak routine in Athena for the spline fit through the EXAFS region. Arsenic XANES spectra were fit by linear least-squares combination fits of reference compounds to verify the As oxidation state. Arsenic and Fe XANES, XAS and FT analysis are showed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

XANES data were fit by reference spectrum of arsenate sorbed to hydrous ferric oxide (As(V)-FH), natural scorodite and Na2HAsO4. The contribution of each component to the fits is indicated in percent 2. b) Iron K-edge XANES, EXAFS and Fourier transforms (FT) of of the colloid samples spectra wastepile (WP), riverbed (RB) and Subsoil (SS). XANES and EXAFS spectra were analyzed by linear least-squares combination fits with reference compound spectra of smectite (SWy-2), natural scorodite and arsenate sorbed to hydrous ferric oxide (As(V)-FH). The contribution of each component to the fits is indicated in percent This research is currently in progress within the frame of the research project CGL2010-17434 supported by the Spanish National Research Plan and a related new proposal for beam time at the BM25A Spanish beamline will be submitted.</p></div>
