<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>With the present report, we report selected spectra and preliminary analysis showing the main results obtained during the beamtime. XAS taken with right and left hand circular polarizations are in red and black respectively; calculated XMCD signal is in green. With X and Y we denote Energy (eV) and normalized Intensity measured in total electron yield (arb.un.).</p><p>The experiment concerned the study of the magnetic properties of Cr iodide (CrI2) monolayer grown by MBE on metallic and insulating substrates. Although similar the two systems manifests some differences, notably in peak energy position and field dependence at low temperature (&lt;20K).</p><p>Part I: Epitaxial monolayer Chromium Iodide grown on Au(111) XAS+XMCD, 4K, 9T, Normal Incidence XAS+XMCD, 4K, 9T, Grazing Incidence XAS+XNLD, 4K, 0T, Grazing Incidence (30°) Finite linear dichroism suggests anisotropic electronic charge distribution, possibly due to local distortion of the pristine octahedral coordination expected for Cr. 30% dichroism 20% dichroism. XMCD shape very similar to Normal Incidence case. Hystersis loop between 9T and -9T at 4K Temperature dependence STM image of epitaxial monolayer Chromium Iodide grown on Au(111) Au CrI2</p><p>The STM image taken at 1V and 0.5nA shows that CrI2 on Au111 forms long stipes of hundreds nm length. The Au surface is visible (although covered by iodine). The covergae is less than one monolayer.</p><p>Fit tendance suggests 1/T dependence, typical of a paramagnetic phase.</p><p>Linear field dependence suggests paramegnetic behaviour. Blue and red points correspond to magnetic field ramps from 9T to -9T and from -9T to 9T respectively. Points out of the guidline are aretefacts due to measuring in TEY at nearly zero magnetic field. The sharp diffraction pattern (50eV) is related to long range surface order and epitaxial alignment with the high symmetry directions of the substrate. Geometrical relationship between overlayer and substrate (Au111) spots is compatible with the in-plane periodicity of the CrI2 surface lattice, i.e. 3. <ref type="bibr">929Ȧ. Tracy et al., Acta Crystallographica, 15.5 (1962)</ref> XAS are very similar for Cr iodide layer grown on the two different substrates. There is however a chemical shift of 0.3eV.</p></div>
