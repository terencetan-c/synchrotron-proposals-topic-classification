Ravelli Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Benoit Gigant * (research assistant), Marcel Knossow (research director), LEBS, Bat 34, CNRS UPR9063, 1 av. de la Terrasse, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France I. Llorens (student), P. Meyer (Post-doc), LEBS, Bat 34, CNRS UPR9063, 1 av. de la Terrasse, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France Report: I. Llorens, P. Meyer (1 shifts) : yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Structural Genomics project The systematic names of the genes are used. More details on every orf can be found on <ref type="url" target="http://genomics.eu.org:targets.html">http://genomics.eu.org:targets.html</ref> 1) YIR029w (target 205) Spacegroup P3 2 21 a= b=109A; c=190A. Resolution 2.2A. Completion 100% Rsym=6.7%</p><p>This orf codes for an allantoicase, an enzyme associated with the purine metabolism. It breaks down allantoin into glyoxylate and urea and thus is involved in the use of purine as a secondary source of nitrogen. We have collected a wavelength SAD SeMet dataset which allowed the resolution of the structure to 2.2A resolution.</p><p>2) DNA topoisomerase VI.</p><p>During this beamtime allocation, we were also able to test the diffraction power of many crystals of the DNA topoisomerase VI from the archaebacteria S. shibatae. One of these crystals diffracted to 4A but due to radiation damage, we could not collect a full dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benoit Gigant *, Marcel Knossow (2 shift): Structural study of complexes of Tubulin with drugs</head><p>Tubulin is the basic building block of microtubules, one of the key components of the cytoskeleton. In particular, and as an example, during cell division microtubules form the mitotic spindle. Tubulin, either free or microtubule-polymerized, is therefore one of the best characterized targets of anticancer drugs. We have obtained crystals of tubulin in complex with the stathmin-like domain of the neural protein RB3. The structure was solved initially by molecular replacement using an electron microscopy model of tubulin, and subsequently by the SAD method using a selenomethionine derivative of RB3 (see previous reports). The structure has allowed us to determine the binding site of cocristallized ligands of the colchicine binding site of tubulin (manuscript in preparation). The experiment performed at ESRF on ID14eh4 on july 3 /4 were devoted to characterize the binding mode of other ligands of tubulin, with soaked crystals. The soaking technique was previously used succesfully with vinblastine (refinement in progress). Three different ligands were tested and 4 datasets collected. For two ligands, the electron density maps are devoided of specific signal. The last ligand is supposed to bind to the vinblastine site of tubulin. In this case, data were collected to 4.1 Ã… resolution. Indeed, the site overlaps partially with the vinblastine site (confirming our results of April 5 on ID29); refinement of this structure is under way.</p></div>		</body>
