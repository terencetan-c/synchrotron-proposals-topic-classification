<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>90</head><p>Sr in groundwaters is primarily controlled by sorption reactions with aquifer sediments. The extent of sorption is controlled by the geochemistry of the groundwater and sediment mineralogy. Here, batch sorption experiments were used to examine the sorption behaviour of 90Sr in sediment-water systems representative of the UK Sellafield nuclear site based on groundwater and contaminant fluid compositions. In experiments with low ionic strength groundwaters (&lt;0.01 mol L -1 ), pH variation is the main control on sorption. The sorption edge for <ref type="bibr">90</ref> Sr was observed between pH 4 and 6 with maximum sorption occurring (Kd ~ 103 L kg -1 ) at pH 6-8. At ionic strengths above 10 mmol L -1 , and at pH values between 6 and 8, cation exchange processes reduced <ref type="bibr">90</ref> Sr uptake to the sediment. This exchange process explains the lower 90 Sr sorption (Kd ~ 40 L kg -1 ) in the presence of artificial Magnox tank liquor (IS = 29 mmol L_1). Strontium K-edge EXAFS spectra collected from sediments incubated with Sr 2+ in either HCO 3 -buffered groundwater or artificial Magnox tank liquor, revealed a coordination environment of ~9 O atoms at 2.58-2.61 Å after 10 days. This is equivalent to the Sr 2+ hydration sphere for the aqueous ion and indicates that Sr occurs primarily in outer sphere sorption complexes. No change was observed in the Sr sorption environment with EXAFS analysis after 365 days incubation. Sequential extractions performed on sediments after 365 days also found that ~80% of solid associated 90Sr was exchangeable with 1 M MgCl 2 in all experiments. These results suggest that over long periods, 90 Sr in contaminated sediments will remain primarily in weakly bound surface complexes. Therefore, if groundwater ionic strength increases (e.g. by saline intrusion related to sea level rise or by design during site remediation) then substantial remobilisation of 90Sr is to be expected.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Background subtracted Sr K-edge EXAFS spectra (left hand side) and related Fourier transformations (right hand side) collected from a 3000 mg L -1 Sr 2+ solution and sediment samples aged with Sr 2+ for 10 or 365 days in buffered groundwater ("GW") or artificial Magnox tank liquor ("Magnox").

The behaviour of strontium (Sr 2+ ) during microbial reduction in nitrate impacted sediments was investigated in sediment microcosm experiments relevant to nuclear sites. Although Sr 2+ is not expected to be influenced directly by redox state, bioreduction of nitrate caused reduced Sr 2+ solubility due to an increase in pH during bioreduction and denitrification. Sr 2+ removal was greatest in systems with the highest initial nitrate loading and consequently more alkaline conditions at the end of denitrification. After denitrification, re-release of Sr 2+ back into solution occurred coincident with the onset of metal (Mn(IV) and Fe(III)) reduction which caused minor pH changes in all microcosms with the exception of the bicarbonate buffered system with initial nitrate of 100 mM and final pH of ~ 9. In this system ~ 95 % of Sr 2+ remained associated with the sediment throughout the progression of bioreduction at high pH. Analysis of this pH 9 system using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron microscopy coupled to thermodynamic modelling suggested that Sr 2+ became partially incorporated within carbonate phases which were formed at higher pH. This is in contrast to all other systems where final pH was &lt; 9, here XAS analysis showed that outer sphere Sr 2+ sorption predominated. These results provide insight into the likely environmental fate of the significant radioactive contaminant, 90 Sr, during changes in sediment biogeochemistry induced by bioreduction in nitrate impacted nuclear contaminated environments.  Alteration of sediments by hyperalkaline cement leachate: Implications for strontium adsorption and incorporation, for submission Fall 2012, currently available as a final draft.</p><p>Abstract: The use of cementitious materials is ubiquitous at nuclear facilities and in radioactive waste packaging. Water in contact with fresh cement produces a highly alkaline solution dominated by K and Na hydroxides causing localised areas of high pH groundwater at the concrete/soil interface. Silicate minerals within sediments and clay barrier materials are known to alter to zeolite and feldspathoid phases under these conditions. The effect of alkaline pore fluid induced weathering reactions on the mobility of radionuclides is not well understood, especially with respect to potentially highly soluble fission products such as 90 Sr (as Sr <ref type="bibr">2+</ref> ). Here we used 20 g.L -1 batch experiments containing sediments representative of the UK Sellafield nuclear site in a pH 13.5 high ionic strength cement-based leachate to investigate Sr 2+ sorption as a function of time. Experiments initially contained 20 ppm Sr 2+ (spiked with 30 Bq.mL -1 90 Sr tracer) and were sampled from 2 days up to one year (one experiment was aged for one year at 70°C).</p><p>Change in Sr speciation within sediments was determined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequential extraction techniques. At 2 days 72.6±8.6% 90Sr was removed from solution, which rose to 93.8±3.3% at 10 days but then decreased to 81.8% after a year. In the 70°C aged sample sorption increased to 98.0±2.5%. This suggests that initial alteration enhances Sr sorption but further recrystallisation releases some sorbed Sr. Sequential extractions show that the majority (65-75%) of 90 Sr remains in the MgCl2 exchangeable fraction even after one year. In the 70°C aged sample, 25.2±5.8% 90 Sr was found to be residual. EXAFS analysis revealed two Sr-OSi(Al) bond distances at 3.69 and 3.84 in a 10 day sample and at 3.57 and 3.83 Å in a one year sample, consistent with weak Sr sorption to aluminosilicate phases. EXAFS spectra from a 70°C aged sample contain evidence for a single Sr-O-Si(Al) bond distance at 3.45 Å consistent with Sr incorporation in the neoformed zeolite phase chabazite. These results indicate that alkaline altered sediments could be a sink for 90 Sr in the environment.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2.</head><figDesc>Thorpe C.
