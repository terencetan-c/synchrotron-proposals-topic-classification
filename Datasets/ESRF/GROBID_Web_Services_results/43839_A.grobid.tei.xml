This type of alteration is treated by restorers with mildly Mn-reducing agents such as hydroxylamine (NH2OH) (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Weathering of (historical) glass is a multi-step physico-chemical transformation involving (a) leaching of mobile cations from the glass (replacement by protons), leading to the formation of stacks of μm-thin lamellae of leached-out glass interspersed with voids <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>,</p><p>(a) ≡Si-O-K + H3O+ ↔ ≡Si-O-H + H2O + K+(aq) followed by diffusion of Mn-ions (present as Mn 2+ and/or Mn 3+ in the original glass [2; 3] towards the voids and formation of (b) brown-black precipitates, containing more oxidized Mn species, e.g.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(b) Mn2+ + ½O2 + H2O ↔ MnO2↓ + 2H+</formula><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Multi-step corrosion of historical glass, leading to discoloration; conservation treatment.</p><p>K-edge Mn-XANES has been performed on historical glass samples (see e.g. reference 2-3-4), principally with the aim of determining the oxidation state of the Mn, introduced by glassmakers as a colorant/decolorizer. Only one study has been performed attempting to use K-edge Mn-XANES on the Mn in the precipitation areas of historical glass artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation</head><p>The historical (stained) glass samples that were examined originated from the Canterbury Cathedral (U.K.). These glass samples date to the 14 th century and have suffered corrosion in wet environment (groundwater), for 3-4 centuries. Cross sections of the corroded glass fragments were prepared and embedded in acrilic resin, on the crosssections the XANES measurements were performed and the Mn-elemental maps were collected. The analyses were done before and after a 30 minutes treatment with hydroxilamine 5%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photoreduction</head><p>The first test performed at ESRF ID21 was the evaluation of the effect of the incident synchrotron beam on the samples, since beam-induced reduction/oxidation of different chemical species are often reported in literature (see e.g. references 6-7). Indeed photo-reduction of the more oxidized forms of Mn towards Mn(II) has been encountered, when using a focussed beam, as it is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, reporting the result of subsequent measurements on the same spot. To overcome this problem, a defocussed beam was selected for the collection of the XANES spectra, while for the maps the focussed beam (0.7x0.9 µm) was used, in order to maintain the highest detail as possible, considering that the collection time (200 ms) for each pixel was low enough to avoid reduction.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

<div><p>Collection of standards XANES spectra of several Mn-containing materials were collected in transmission and fluorescence mode, comprising Mn-containing minerals, Mn salts and Mn-containing glasses. These spectra were then used as references for identifyng the Mn-species contained in the unknown samples. The spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We have sought to cover the full range of oxidation states of Mn with our references, as a salt or in a siliceous matrix (minerals/glasses).</p><p>Validation of the treatment and quantitative information XANES spectra of the original glass, leached layer and Mn-bodies have been collected of three untreated sample (<rs type="grantNumber">C2</rs>, <rs type="grantNumber">C10</rs> and <rs type="grantNumber">C12</rs>). In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> the areas where the XANES spectra were collected are shown on a photograph of sample C12: the collection followed a line crossing first the Mn-precipitation area, then the leached layer, and finally the healthy glass. When observing Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, it is clear that the Mn is in-situ reduced by the hydroxylamine: it is the first time that the effect of this treatment is proven by µ-XANES. The next step has been that of extracting quantitative information from the XANES spectra. To do so, all the reference and unknown spectra have been normalized and calibrated (Mn foil) using the Athena IFEFFIT software package. For quantitatively estimating the average valence state of Mn, a linear combination fit has been used. In figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, XANES spectra of the Mn-precipitation areas, altered and healthy glass for sample C12 before/after treatment are shown. The effect of the treatment is clear and the resulting product is Mn(II), while the oxidation state of the original material appears to be a mixture of Mn(II) (IV) and (VI), the weights of each component are shown in the figure. The <rs type="funder">presence of Mn(VI)</rs> in the precipitation bodies is also a novelty, being only Mn(IV) reported in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref>8,9]. It is evident that, in any case of µ-XANES experiments on Mn-deposition in glass, measures have to be taken (such as the use of a defocussed beam, in this case) in order to avoid the possibility of local photo-reduction. The presence of water-soluble manganates could also explain the ease of removal by means of a low concentrated reducing solution, such as that used in our experiment.</p></div>
<div><head>Maps</head><p>At <rs type="grantNumber">ESRF ID21</rs>, Mn K-edge chemical state maps of selected areas of the samples have been recorded at two different energies: 6.5630 keV and 6.5714 keV, that are, respectively, the energy most efficiently excitating Mn(II) and the one most efficiently excitating Mn(IV). Subsequently, the glass samples were treated for two times 30 minutes with hydroxylamine 2% in de-onised water, rinsed with ethanol and then let dry out. Maps were collected after the first and the second treatment. The maps of sample C12 at the three stages of treatment (0-30-60 minutes) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. It is clear from these images that the more oxidized Mn-species, shown in red (orange due to the co-existing Mn 2+ shown in green) tend to disappear with the increasing treatment time. Mn(II) is abundant in the altered layer, and in a lesser measure in the deposition areas. It can be seen that in place of (most of the) Mn(IV), <rs type="projectName">Mn(II) is found in certain deposition areas. Thus</rs>, the 5% hydroxylamine treatment proves to be effective in two steps:</p><p>-reduction of the oxidized Mn-species to Mn(II) -leaching of Mn(II) from the superficial areas of the sample In addition to that, we can see that after 60 minutes there is still some Mn present in the leached glass layer. The presence of residual Mn could lead to the unwanted re-oxidation and re-precipitation of the dark Mnbodies.</p></div>

After the treatment the oxidation state of the glass does not change, while the in the precipitation area only Mn(II) could be found. From the Mn-elemental maps collected at different energies it can be visually observed how the treatment first reduced the Mn to the 2+ state and then removes it in acqueous solution. It is important to note that after the tested time not all the available Mn in the altered glass layer has been removed. This experiment has provided only a limited view of the phenomenon (1 reagent/1 concentration): in order to have a full perspective more reducing and complexing agents (citric acid, EDTA, acetylacetone) should be tested on corroded glass samples, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and formulate responsible guidelines for glass restoration. On the other hand, also the glass composition (e.g. soda glass, potash glass, etc.) represents an important factor that must be evaluated. With this aim, experimentally produced/aged glass chips, with different compositions, should be the subject of a further step of this study, in order to substitute the unique historical glass samples with a more viable and reproducible test-material. With the aim of testing more products with different concentrations, and different glass compositions, proposal p26444 has been submitted on 01/09/2010, as a continuation of experiment EC602.</p></div>			</div>
