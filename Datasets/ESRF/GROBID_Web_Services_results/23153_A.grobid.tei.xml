Due to its ability to bind ssRNA, it has been suggested that the protein is involved in the selection and condensation of the BTV ssRNA segments prior to genome encapsidation.</p><p>We determined the crystal structure of the 177 amino acid N terminal domain, sufficient for the ssRNA binding ability of NS2, to 2.4 Å resolution using anomalous scattering methods. We have found that the NS2 1-177 monomer is folded as a β sandwich with a unique topology. The structure reveals strong NS2 1-177 -NS2 1-177 contacts, that explain the ability of the protein to self assemble into large homomultimeric complexes. Of the entire surface area of the NS2 1-177 monomer, one third is used to create the interfaces of the curved multimeric assembly observed in the crystal structure. The structure reported here shows how the N-terminal domain would be able to bind ssRNA non-specifically protecting the bound regions in a heterogeneous multimeric, but not polymeric, complex. </p></div>
