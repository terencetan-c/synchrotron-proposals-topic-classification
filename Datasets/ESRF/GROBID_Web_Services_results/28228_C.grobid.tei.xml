<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SI-1021 was proposed to investigate the kinetic aspects of the growth and structure of organic heterostructures of organic semiconductors. The experiments performed at ID10B revealed unexpected and interesting results about the growth of DIP on F 16 CuPc. It was seen that a rearrangement of the F 16 CuPc occurs when DIP is evaporated on top at high temperature. Due the interest and success of these experiments, the investigation was extended to heterostructures of F 16 CuPc (n-type) and pentacene (p-type). These experiments were performed at ID3. The objectives of this experiment have been succefully accomplished . The figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows in-situ GIXD of growth of F16CuPc on top of pentacene. Pentacene films with three different thicknesses have been used as template: (a) 42 Å of pentacene, (b) 130 Å of pentacene, (c) 202 Å of pentacene. When F 16 CuPc is grown on top of 42 Å of pentacene, the same in-plane Bragg reflections than on SiO 2 are observed. This is corroborated by the specular Bragg reflections. In this structure the molecules are standing upright with a distance between layers of about 14.3 Å. For increasing thicknesses of the pentacene underneath, a second phase is formed as evidenced by the appearance of new in-plane reflections (see arrow in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>). With increasing thickness of pentacene, this phase of F 16 CuPc predominates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">F 16 CuPc on pentacene</head><p>The X-ray specular scans measured simultaneously shows the development of an additional Bragg peak corresponding to a distance of around 3.2 Å for increasing thickness of pentacene. This shows that, when F16CuPc is evaporated on top of thin films of pentacene, the molecules stand upright, as measured on SiO2. However, on top of thicker pentacene films, a lying-down phase of F16CuPc is formed. The ratio between the upright and lying-down phases decreases for increasing pentacene thickness. Experiments about the thermal stability of the bilayers have been performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Pentacene on top of F 16 CuPc</head><p>X-ray specular measurements show that pentacene forms smooth films with the so-called thin-phase on top of F 16 CuPc (figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). GIXD measurements show that the deposition of pentacene does not induce changes on the F 16 CuPc structure underneath (figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). The mean lateral domains size is smaller than that for pentacene on SiO 2 .</p><p>The thermal stability of pentacene is enhanced by the presence of F 16 CuPc on top.</p><p>To conclude, well ordered bilayers of pentacene on top of F 16 CuPc are formed at room temperature. However, the growth of F1 6 CuPc on pentacene results in the coexistence of a standing and a lying-down phases. The ratio between the two phases varies with the thickness of the pentacene underneath. We are performing currently AFM mesurements to understand the microscopic origin of the formation of a lyingdown phase. We are analizing the X-ray data concerning the quantification of the structural phases and the thermal expansion.</p><p>This in-situ study (by GIXD, X-ray reflectivy) has revealed new aspects of the growth and structure of organic heterostructures showing that the growth mechanisms differ from those of inorganic heterostructures. Further structural investigations with other molecules is neccesary to understand the parameters governing the structure of organic heterostructures. 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 60 Å F16CuPc 29 Å Pentacene 87 Å Pentacene 174 Å Pentacene 260 Å Pentacene Intensity Q</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 GIXD of F16CuPc on top (a) 42 Å of pentacene, (b) 130 Å of pentacene, (c) 202 Å of pentacene</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have performed in-situ and simultaneously X-ray Specular reflectometry and GIXD during the growth. Additionaly Real-time measurement of the intensity at the 3/2 and 1/2 Bragg point Vs coverage have been performed. It is known that thin films of pentacene presents a single phase (thin film phase) at room temperature. At higher temperature, a second phase is present (bulk phase). For this reason the majority of the measurements have been performed at a substrate temperature of 25ºC (room temperature)</p></div>
