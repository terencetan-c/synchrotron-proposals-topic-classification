				<title level="a" type="main">We aim at solving the structure of temporal supercomplexes formed around Photosystem I (PSI) during steady state and under stress conditions by the cryo EM technique. So far our visits yielded two high--resolution structures of two distinct forms of Photosystem I (PSI) from the halotolerant green algae Dunaliella salina. We solved the crystal structure of this supercomplex at 3.2 A resolution (Perez--Boerema A, Klaiman D, Caspy I, Netzer--El S, Amunts A, Nelson N., 2020. Structure of a minimal photosystem I from a green alga. Nature Plants 6:321--327 PDB 6RHZ). The second visit yielded structure at 2.84 A resolution of a much larger form of PSI containing 8 additional subunits and about 40 additional prosthetic groups (Caspy I, Malavath T, Klaiman D, Fadeeva M, Shkolnisky Y, Nelson N. (2020) Structure and Energy Transfer Pathways of the Dunaliella Salina Photosystem I Supercomplex. BBA --Bioenergetics, in press PDB 6SL5). In the current experiment we attempted solving larger complex of PSI from TSP4 temperature sensitive mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. PSI was isolated from cells grown at 37 O C where PSII</title>

We are processing the somewhat complicated data and are quit certain to get the two distinct classes at high resolution. We would like to continue our program and in next visit to collect more data for solving the large supercomplex at high resolution.</p><p>The 3 days experiment excided all my expectations. Initial structures of large (left) and normal (right) PSI of TSP4 C. reinhardtii mutant.</p></div>
