<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During this experiment, the PI and collaborators with the help of beam scientists Valerio Cerantola and Alexander Chumakov used synchrotron Mössbauer source spectroscopy to analyse a set of 8 mantle xenoliths and ~10 cratonic inclusions in diamonds from varies locations worldwide.</p><p>Mantle xenoliths comprised of 5 low-pressure spinel peridotites containing individual grains of spinel, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and olivine and 3 eclogitic samples containing individual grains of garnets and clinopyroxenes. Additionally, we analysed ~10 garnet inclusions in diamonds from Siberia and South Africa. These data were subdivided into two studies: (1) study of mantle xenoliths and reproducibility of classical Mossbauer data and (2) study of eclogitic inclusions in diamond of cratonic origin.</p><p>This study (1) is still in progress with preliminary results having been reported at Goldschmidt 2019 in Barcelona. The conference abstract and figures are shown below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ferric ferrous ratios in mantle xenoliths by Synchrotron Mössbauer Source Spectroscopy.</head><p>Synchrotron Mössbauer Source (SMS) spectroscopy (ESRF, Grenoble, France) has high spatial resolution (~20 microns) and has been successfully applied to measuring Fe 3+ concentrations in diamond inclusions <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Over the last few decades a number of studies have been conducted on individual minerals from mantle xenoliths in order to determine the oxidation state of the upper mantle. These studies were conducted using ≥50 mg of handpicked grains as opposed to individual crystals. In this study, we applied SMS to measure ferric iron contents of individual spinels, orthopyroxenes, clinopyroxenes and garnets from 5 spinel peridotite xenoliths and 1 pyroxenite and 2 eclogite xenoliths. Spinel xenoliths derive from Kilbourne hole, Mont Briançon and Ichinomegata. Spinels from these xenoliths were previously analysed by Mössbauer spectroscopy on bulk separates. Eclogite xenoliths (UAS 1055, UAS 1525) and pyroxenite xenolith (UAS 510) were obtained from Udachnaya kimberlite pipe in Siberia. In spinel peridotites measured ratios range between 0.04-0.14 Fe 3+ /Fetot for Opx, 0.14-0.19 Fe 3+ /Fetot for Cpx and between 0.15-0.23 for Spl. These values are broadly in agreement with previous measurements <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. In eclogites and pyroxenite, the ratios range between 0.05-0.16 for garnet and 0.07-0.17 for Cpx, showing D Grt/Cpx for Fe 3+ of 0.8-1.9.</p><p>Oxygen fugacities derived from the spinel-olivineorthopyroxene oxybarometer are consistent with previous results for the continental lithosphere fO2 of between -1 and +1 log units relative to the FMQ buffer. Nevertheless, we observe small differences between our results on individual grains and previous data on bulk separates. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In conclusion:</head><p>• We observed approximately 20% difference in Fe 3+ /Fetot content of spinels analysed by SMS and classical Mossbauer on grain separates with SMS having lower values. This may be related to matrix correction applied at SMS or to single grain vs multiple grain analysis.</p><p>• Accounting for the ferric iron in the orthopyroxene in equilibrium with spinel, this difference in Fe 3+ /Fetot values may translate into 0.5-0.8 log units of fO2.</p><p>• Given the uncertainties, even with the specified difference in fO2s, the two methods are in fairly good agreement.</p><p>The study ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) is also in progress. At the moment, it hasn't been independently reported at any of the conferences, however, the data obtained at ESRF will be combined with other petrological or geochemical studies prior to publication, due to the scarcity of data points. More inclusions in diamonds of eclogitic paragenesis and eclogitic xenoliths are required to be analysed for an individual publication.</p><p>Figure 2.
