<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>All data sets were processed using XDS. Data sets from 5 crystals were recorded : 1) MAD data set from Se-Met crystals to 2 Å resolution; 2) Native data set from WT crystal to 1.75 Å; 3) Native data set from an orthorhombic form to 2.5 Å. Crystals 1 &amp; 2 belong to one form of I4 tetragonal crystals whose cell dimensions are described in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. These 3 data sets were used for solving the structure, refining it and for confirming the dimeric structure of the protein (see below). Additionally, two complete SAD data sets to around 2 Å resolution were recorded from crystals of a different I4 tetragonal form (cell dimensions: a,b = 92.8, c= 87.5 Å), however the anomalous signal in those data sets was too low to enable phasing, even though the data looked good. The structure was solved from the MAD data set (#1 above). Of the 8 Se-Met residues in the protein (4 in each chain) 5 were located using SHELX and enabled phasing using SHARP. The chains (the protein is a dimer and crystallizes with a dimer in the a.u. in all forms) were traced nearly to their full length (chain B shows only 158 out of the 163 residues) using the RESOLVE-BUILD script and arp-Warp. For full refinement the native data set to 1.75 Å (#2 above) was used. The current R/R-free are 0.179/0.235. Since the dimeric structure of the protein was somewhat unexpected, it was confirmed using the the data sets from the orthorhombic form (#3 above). This form was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a sufficiently low R-factor. The paper describing the structure in now in press in JMB and will be sent to ESRF as soon as it is published.</p><p>During this shift, 3 crystals of valine (the feed-back inhibitor) soaked crystals were mounted, but proved to diffract poorly with clear indications for disorder to the extent that data collection was abandoned.</p><p>Table 1.
