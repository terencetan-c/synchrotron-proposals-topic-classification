<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>At room pressure, the addition of alkali oxide to pure SiO 2 leads to a dimensional reduction of the silicate network. In the particular case of crystalline lithium silicates, the 3D structure of SiO 2 made of corner-sharing SiO 4 tetrahedra is sequentially modified, while Li deconstructs the framework so as to obtain layers (Li 2 Si 2 O 5 ), then chains (Li 2 SiO 3 ), and clusters made of two SiO 4 (Li 6 Si 2 O 7 ), to end up with a fully saturated framework made of isolated SiO 4 tetrahedra surrounded by Li in the end-member Li 4 SiO 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> While the network structure is usually described in terms of connections between the basic structural units, i.e. the SiO 4 tetrahedra, the non-bonding O sites also reflect the network topology and degree of network polymerization. A lower degree of polymerization in the starting glass should result in important changes of the compressibility properties in comparison with a pure SiO 2 glass resulting in a quite different behaviour of the bonding transformation under pressure.</p><p>Due to COVID sanitary restrictions, the present experiments were carried out remotely thanks to the excellent work of C. Sahle and E. de Clermont Gallerande from the ID20 beamline. Amorphous Li 2 SiO 3 was measured in a diamond-anvil cell with 500 µm-cullet diamonds provided by ESRF. Measurements were done through beryllium gasket in the case of the O K-edge or through a mixture of cubic boron nitride epoxy and diamond powder in the case of Si L 2,3 edge. X-ray Raman scattering measurements were carried out at the ID20 beamline. In order to create losses in the vicinity of the silicon L 2,3 -edge and the oxygen K-edge, incident energy was scanned from 9.79 to 9.84 keV and 10.22 to 10.26 keV respectively at a constant analyzer energy of 9.7 keV with an overall energy resolution of 0.7 eV (FWHM). All data were processed using the XRStools software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> Si L 2,3 -edge and O K-edge XRS spectra of glassy Li 2 SiO 3 were measured in situ as a function of pressure. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) Spectral changes are clearly pointed out on both edges, and mostly around 20-25GPa. Through comparison to vitreous SiO 2 , we show that up to 25GPa the densification mainly involves recombination of NBO, increase of the network polymerization and topological reorganization without increasing the coordination of silicon atoms. After 25GPa, it is unclear if amorphous Li 2 SiO 3 undergoes similar structural changes as SiO 2 or if the presence of lithium atoms has an influence on the densification processes. Additional pressure points would be necessary in order to terminate probing the full pressure induced structural transformation. In conclusion, thanks to the great capabilities of the ID20 beamline, successful measurements have been obtained at high-pressure using a panoramic diamond anvil cell with an excellent signal to noise ratio. The observed modifications are indicative of a spatial reorganisation of atoms induced by pressure without any coordination change of Si or O atoms.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Local contact(s): Christoph SAHLE and Emmanuelle de CLERMONT GALLERANDE Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Gérald Lelong -IMPMC Sorbonne Université</figDesc></figure>
