<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction and aim of the experience:</head><p>The experiment at ID21 focuses on the understanding of the alteration state of the blue smalt pigment in several micro-samples collected on paintings by a famous German 19 th c's painter Caspar David Friedrich <ref type="bibr">(CDF, 1774</ref><ref type="bibr">(CDF, -1840) )</ref> from the collections of the Alte Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin-Stiftung Preuβischer Kulturbesitz (ANG) and other paint samples from the Louvre Museum, Paris. Preliminary analyses showed that the blue smalt pigment is fundamental for the impression of these paintings, which are heavily discolored today.</p><p>The Co colored potash glass called smalt was basically used as a blue pigment between the 15th and the 18th c. It is known to be unstable over time, going from a deep blue hue to a grey-yellow color. The color change is related to a loss of K + ions leading to a change in coordination of tetrahedral Co 2+ ions towards octahedral coordination. The CDF paintings under investigation correspond to one of the latest use of this pigment we know of and they present smalt in a partly degraded state. The aims of these measurements was twofold: first we wanted to quantify the degradation state of smalt in the paint layers and second we wanted to improve our understanding of the alteration mechanism by identifying precisely the Co-and K-based degradation products. Submicronic XRF was combined with high resolution Co and K-edge microXANES mapping of the smalt grains and other products present around the smalt grains to determine the coordination state of Co and K in the present phases in order to relate their chemical state to the degradation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods:</head><p>For this experiment 22 historic paint samples have been brought to ID21 including six samples from two paintings of CDF from the collections of the ANG and 16 samples from paintings of the Louvre Museum. In addition to these samples, thirty model samples prepared with smalt pure or mixed with cerussite or hydrocerussite in linseed oil or egg and artificially aged were brought. Model samples were first analyzed in unfocused mode and then in focused mode on thin section prepared at the beamline. XRF mapping: Samples have been analyzed under vacuum at the ID21 beamline with a submicrometric beam. The Co and K μXRF maps have be acquired at the Co-K-edge energy and have been used to select locations for the μXAS measurements. For each sample a first quick mapping has been performed to select the region of interest. These maps were several hundred micrometers wide and high depending on the size of the sample and were recorded with a step size of 2x2 µm 2 and a dwell time of 0.02 s.</p><p>Then a high-definition map was performed in the most interesting zone. These maps were 99x99 µm 2 with a step size of 0.5x0.5 µm 2 and a dwell time of 0.05 s.</p><p>µXANES: µXANES at the Co K-edge has been performed on all samples and 6 samples were also analyzed with µXANES at the K K-edge (four historical samples and two model samples) µXANES at the Co K-edge were recorded between 7670 and 8050 keV with a step size of 0.5 eV and a dwell time of 0.1 s. µXANES at the K K-edge were recorded between 3580 and 3730 eV with 500 steps of 0.3 eV and a dwell time of 0.1 s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results:</head><p>Model samples:</p><p>We first analysed model samples by µXRF and XANES at Co K-edge on unfocused mode to verify their global alteration state (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As it is shown on the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, µXANES spectra are similar in a series with same composition but different ageing time even if the visual aspect the series show that colour have changed. Smalt must have weathered at least at the surface, but the unfocused beam and the penetration of X-rays at this energy must have averaged the signal between the smalt at the surface of the samples. Thin sections of model samples were prepared to analyse them at a microscopic scale. µXANES has been performed on these thin sections (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) and the difference between the spectra could be clearly evidenced showing that the smalt has weathered.</p><p>Historic samples: Each historical sample has been first analysed by µXRF mapping. Elemental maps were obtained at the 7.7 keV, these maps allowed to locate smalt grains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). On the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> Co, Si and K distributions are shown. Si and K maps are well defined and allow to distinguish the grains, although the Co map is blurred. The penetration of X-rays at this energy may be the cause of the problem. Actually when we compare the XANES spectra at the Co K-edge from the centre of a K rich grain and from the edge of the same grain poor in K the distinction between them is not as clear as expected (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Co K-edge XANES can be a good way to characterise the global alteration state of smalt pigment in a paint layer but does not seem to be able to evaluate the state of a grain in a thick section at a microscopic scale. However, it is possible to see a clear difference between spectra of smalt grains with different alteration state at the K K-edge: the more altered a grain is the more intense the white line of K edge is and the intensity of the second peak increases as well (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Furthermore, the analysis of the free K ion in the oil medium shows that it reacts with other components of the paint forming salt and possibly soap. A further investigation of these species at the K K-edge would be interesting to determine with which component of the paint leached K reacts in order to better understand the factors responsible for the alteration of the pigment.  During the experiment on ID21, several historical and model samples were analyzed by µXRF and µXANES. Elemental maps were acquired on all samples with µXRF and µXANES at the Co K-edge evidencing smalt grains. These measurements have allowed to characterize the global alteration state of the pigment in each sample, but the penetration of X-ray at Co K-edge prevents an analysis at the scale of a grain. To get rid of this problem, thin sections of model samples were prepared at the beamline but for this was not possible for valuable historical samples. K K-edge XANES was then realized on some of the historical samples. At this energy, Xray penetration is lower, and this has allowed to characterize in these samples the alteration states of grains. Furthermore, XANES spectra of K which has leached from the smalt grains show that it is found in new structure such as salts. Further investigation of these structures should allow us to learn what K-ions react with in the paint layers and give us more information on the causes of smalt alteration.</p></div>
