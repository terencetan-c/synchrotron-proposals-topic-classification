Monomeric and dimeric reaction center from spinach. Five crystals of different forms were examined for quality and effectiveness of possible cryo-protection agents. Diffraction was poor (~10Å) in all cases, however short incubations with parrafin oil gave the best results. b. MntC -the manganese solute binding protein (SBP) of the MntABC transport system. Four complete data sets were collected. These data were used as native stes in connection with previously collected MAD data, affording structure determinatino and refinement. The MntC crystallized in space group P3121, with a trimer in the asymmetric unit, which is different then previously determined SBPs. We have refined the structure to an R/R free of 0.25/0.31, and are in the process of refinement completion and preperation of the manuscript. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the electron density (8 ) surrounding the manganese in the binding site and the positions of the four liganding residues. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: MX-147</head><p>1) KDO8P synthase from E. coli. We collected three full data sets of the enzyme in the following conditions: a. In the presence of both substrates A5P and PEP. The crystals were soaked at 4 o C and then flash frozen. Data was collected to 2.9Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, however the substrates could not be visualized. b. In the presence of the substrate PEP, following crystal stabilizatin with glutaraldehyde (GA).</p><p>The KDO8PS crystals are problematic due to their inherent instability upon addition of substrates. We attempted to stabilize the proteins by a short treatment with GA, however the treatment induced a high degree of mosaic spread. c. In the presence of the product KDO8P. A full data set to 2.7Å was collected. The positin of the product was located in the structure as seen in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This structure, along with a number of other KDO8PS structures have been described in a paper recently submitted to JBC: Crystallographic analysis of initial modes of ligand binding in Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase Radion Vainer, Valery Belakhov, Emilia Rabkin, Apurba Sau, Cristina Furdui, Karen S. Anderson, Timor Baasov and Noam Adir.</p><p>2) KDO8PS from the hyperthermophile A. pyrophilus. A number of trial crystals were examined, croprotection conditions were found, and a data set to 3.5Å was collected. We have used these results to now improve the crystal quality, and we have now collected data to 2.2Å and structure determination is under way.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
