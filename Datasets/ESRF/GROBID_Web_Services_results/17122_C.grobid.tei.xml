<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The kingdom of archaea excels through a remarkable amount of extremophilic organisms. One example are the halophilic archaea which live in extremely high salt environments. A unique feature of proteins from these halobacteria is their stability under nearly saturated salt conditions. The structural properties of halophilic proteins are only partially understood as compared to their mesophilic homologs. However, a broader structural repertoire for halophilic proteins would not only advance the understanding of this extremophily on an molecular level, but would be highly beneficial for adapting other mesophilic proteins to high-salt conditions by protein engineering als well. We investigate the structures of two halophilic proteins which comprise as hollow spheres inner nanocompartments.</p><p>The first example is the DNA-protective protein dps from Halobacterium salinarum which was crystallized in two different crystal forms (hsod, hprot). Two native datasets have been collected earlier for the crystal form hsod but the method of molecular replacement failed to yield any consistent results until now. For both crystal forms heavy atom trials have been made, for the second crystal form a native dataset has been collected at 2.8 resolution using the beam-line EH3.</p><p>The table, below, summarizes the collection statistics of the dps datasets.</p><p>Dataset Name Cell dimensions Resolution Completness spg.

Analysis of the self-rotation functions demonstrated the presence of two dps dodecamers in the hprot crystal form where the second dodecamer is rotated by 90ยก along its twofold relative to the first dodecamer. Consequently, the lattice symmetry was found to be P3 instead of the observed crystal symmetry P321 and a first packing model (24/3 monomers per a. s. u.) was derived for the halophilic dps protein which is now subjected to refinement.</p><p>The second example of a halophilic protein that was crystallized by us is the lumichrome-binding protein from H. salinarum. We collected at ID14-3 two native datasets to higher resolution than before of which one is now used for the further refinement of this remarkable protein. The lumichrome-binding protein assembles like the dps protein to hollow-sphere like dodecamers. Along the twofolds of this 23-symmetric particle a dimer of lumichromes is bound between two symmetry-related tryptophanes. The biological function of the lumichrome-binding protein which is present in several pathogenic eubacterial species is currently a matter of investigation.</p><p>Dataset Name Cell dimensions Resolution Completness spg.
