<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>These inclusions ranged from 50 to 150 microns in size and derived from subcratonic depths, roughly between 250 and 500 km. These samples were unique in that most of diamond inclusions are coming from depths &lt;250 km. Additionally, due to the small sample size, this was a pioneering study that could not be conducted using any other facility in the world.</p><p>As a result, the garnets contained higher percentages of the most oxidised form of iron the deeper they formed in the mantle. Garnets from 500 kilometres, for example, had twice as much oxidised iron as garnets from the shallow mantle. One of the reasons for that could be in oxidised material brought into the deep mantle by subduction. Carbon compounds in fluids or melted rock may be responsible for this surprisingly high level of oxidation deep in the mantle. It is possible to consider the reaction between CO2 and Fe 2+ , resulting in the oxidation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ and reduction of carbon to diamond.</p><p>The results of this experiment were published in Nature Geoscience <ref type="bibr">(Kiseeva et al., 2018)</ref>, and also featured in the ESRF Highlights in 2018, with an article entitled "Oxidised garnets from the Earth's transition zone".</p><p>Below is the abstract of the publication and a figure outlining data produced at ERSF.</p><p>Oxidized iron in garnets from the mantle transition zone. The oxidation state of iron in Earth's mantle is well known to depths of approximately 200 km, but has not been characterized in samples from the lowermost upper mantle (200-410 km depth) or the transition zone (410-660 km depth). Natural samples from the deep (&gt;200 km) mantle are extremely rare, and are usually only found as inclusions in diamonds. Here we use synchrotron Mössbauer source spectroscopy complemented by single-crystal X-ray diffraction to measure the oxidation state of Fe in inclusions of ultra-high pressure majoritic garnet in diamond. The garnets show a pronounced increase in oxidation state with depth, with Fe 3+ /(Fe 3+ + Fe 2+ ) increasing from 0.08 at approximately 240 km depth to 0.30 at approximately 500 km depth. The latter majorites, which come from pyroxenitic bulk compositions, are twice as rich in Fe 3+ as the most oxidized garnets from the shallow mantle. Corresponding oxygen fugacities are above the upper stability limit of Fe metal. This implies that the increase in oxidation state is unconnected to disproportionation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ plus Fe 0 . Instead, the Fe 3+ increase with depth is consistent with the hypothesis that carbonated fluids or melts are the oxidizing agents responsible for the high Fe 3+ contents of the inclusions. The PI thanks the SMS team for the amazing opportunity to conduct this research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
