<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Our study of claudetite II single crystal, monoclinic polymorph of As 2 O 3 , carried out from ambient pressure to 21 GPa has led to the discovery of three new arsenic(III) oxide polymorphs. The ambient α-claudetite II undergoes a second order phase transition to an α' form which has a doubled unit cell volume and two times less inversion centres than the initial structure. The α' form crystallizes in the isomorphic P2 1 /a subgroup of the initial P2 1 /n space group. Subsequently, another second order phase transition occurs and a new α'' form appears with even less inversion centres and three times larger unit cell than the α' form. Finally, a new non-centrosymmetric β-claudetite II polymorph is formed around 12 GPa. The final P2 1 space group is a translationengleiche subgroup of the initial P2 1 /n space group. The loss of all inversion centres allows for a better packing of (As 2 O 3 ) n layers in the crystal structure. Substantial hysteresis has been observed upon decompression, consisting in β form being changed directly into α' (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Last but not least, the transition pressure of 12 GPa corresponds very well to the value of 15 GPa which we have predicted computationally before. The unit cell volume of the β form has been predicted very well (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), even though the computed crystal structure was incorrect. Manuscript for publication in Angewandte Chemie is in preparation. The high pressure structural study of arsenolite single crystal, cubic molecular arsenic(III) oxide polymorph, effected from ambient pressure to 30 GPa showed arsenolite does not undergo any detectable phase transitions in this pressure range when (pseudo)hydrostatic conditions are kept. The deformation of adamantoid As 4 O 6 molecules was unexpected. The intramolecular As•••As separations rose upon pressure increase, while oxygen ligands were pushed toward inside of the molecule. This results in the As 4 O 6 cage becoming more tetrahedral in shape. Interestingly, starting from 3.28(9) GPa we have observed the appearance of additional weak "ghost" reflections in the diffraction pattern on the lower 2θangle side of the main reflections of the As 4 O 6 sample. The "ghost" reflections can be indexed according to the face-centered cubic lattice with the lattice parameter about 2% longer than that of the main As 4 O 6 crystal. This ratio is somewhat smaller for the series of measurements with the compressed sample than for the decompression run (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). After eliminating possibilities of instrumental artefacts, of spurious radiation or multiple diffraction, the origin of the "ghost" reflections has been associated with the formation of an inclusion compound of arsenolite with helium. Despite being very weak and located close to arsenolite main reflections, the "ghost" reflections provided unexpectedly rich structural information about the arsenolite-helium clathrate and we were able to refine its crystal structure and determine its composition to be As 4 O 6 •2He (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The observation the helium clathrate formation for the arsenolite, which is conventionally considered to be nonporous, is very important as it indicates that helium may penetrate even closely packed molecular compounds in high pressure. This should be taken into account when interpreting similar characteristic features in the diffraction pattern when helium is utilized as pressure transmitting medium. The results have been submitted for publication to Journal of the American Chemical Society and are currently under review.  Triangles up stand for compression, triangles downdecompression. In the inset difference between the a and a g lattice parameters is plotted against pressure. Black and red triangles correspond to the compressed and decompressed sample, respectively. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Experimental and theoretical predictions of claudetite II molecular volume changes as a function of pressure.
