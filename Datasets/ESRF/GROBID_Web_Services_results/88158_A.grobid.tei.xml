<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this experiment at the ESRF, we succesfully obtained a large amount of histological and microstructural bone data. We employed a multiscale approach, imaging bone at different resolutions: at 4.24 to 4.33 µm voxel size for histological and microstructural data at the scale of an entire bone, and at 0.72 µm voxel size for histological data at the scale of the bone cells (osteocytes). In addition to the main project on the evolution of endothermy, due to time availability and the diverse set of informations that could be obtained from each scan, we also able used the data for other, then ongoing projects, that have since been published: (1) confirm the presence or absence of osteocytes in a range of ray-finned fishes (results published in Biological Reviews), (2) measure osteocyte lacuna volumes in a range of fossil and modern ray-finned fishes to evaluate their multi-scale variability (results published in Journal of Evolutionary Ecology) and (3) reconstruct the evolution of their genome size (results recently published in PNAS). First and foremost, we collected an unprecedented dataset of microstructural and histological data in modern ray-finned fishes allowing to testamongs otherthe main hypotheses laid down by this proposal (study of the results still ongoing).</p><p>Publications:</p><p>(1) Davesne D., Meunier F.J., Schmitt A.D., Friedman M., Otero O., Benson R.B.J. (2019): The phylogenetic origin and evolution of acellular bone in teleost fishes: insights into osteocyte function in bone metabolism. Biological Reviews, 94(4): 1338-1363.</p><p>The ESRF data were used to test whether osteocytes are present in various modern ray-finned fishes, closing a knowledge-gap for many key taxa. These data were instrumental in laying down our review of the evolution of acellular bone in teleost fishes, demonstrating that osteocytes were lost in a third of modern vertebrates.</p><p>(2) Davesne D., Schmitt A.D., Fernandez V., Benson R.B.J., Sanchez S. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>): Three-dimensional characterization of osteocyte volumes at multiple scales, and its relationship with bone biology and genome evolution in ray-finned fishes. Journal of Evolutionary <ref type="bibr">Biology,</ref><ref type="bibr">33(6)</ref>: 808-830.</p><p>The variation in osteocyte volume across different scales is poorly characterized and mostly relies on incomplete, two-dimensional information. In this study, we characterize the variation of osteocyte volumes in ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), a clade including more than half of modern vertebrate species in which osteocyte biology is poorly known. We use X-ray synchrotron micro-computed tomography (SRμCT) to achieve a three-dimensional visualization of osteocyte lacunae and direct measurement of their size (volumes).</p><p>Our specimen sample is designed to characterize variation in osteocyte lacuna morphology at three scales: within a bone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), among the bones of one individual and among species.

(2021): Fossilized cell structures identify an ancient origin for the teleost whole-genome duplication. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(30): e2101780118.</p><p>We infer patterns of genome size evolution in fossil stem-group teleosts using SRμCT to measure the bone cell volumes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), which correlate with genome size in living species. Our findings indicate that WGD occurred very early on the teleost stem lineage and that all extinct stem-group teleosts known so far possessed duplicated genomes. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Donald DAVESNE* -Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, UK Roger BENSON* -Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, UK Matt FRIEDMAN -Museum of Paleontology, University of Michigan, USA Sophie SANCHEZ* -Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden Armin SCHMITT* -Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, UK (experimentalist only)</figDesc></figure>
