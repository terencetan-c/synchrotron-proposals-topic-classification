<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and summary</head><p>Two shifts of beam time were granted in order to get high resolution diffraction data from Vibrio salmonicida NeuD crystals. V. salmonicida is a gram negative bacterium pathogenic to several fish species. The outermost sugar in the V. salmonicida serotype C2 lipopolysaccharide layer consists of the sialic acid like sugar legionaminic acid (Leg5Am7Ac). Based on sequence-and gene-arrangement conservation, the VsNeuD seems to be involved in acetylating one of the precursor molecules in the synthesis of this sugar. The acetyl donor is the cofactor AcetylCoenzyme A. The crystals that were tested were NeuD alone and NeuD co-crystallized with UDP-GlcNAc, UDP, AcetylCoenzyme A and Coenzyme A. The structure of a NeuD homologue called PglD from Campylobacter jejuni have recently been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Rangarajan et al. 2008)</ref> and served as molecular replacement model for solving our structure. A total of 13 datasets were collected, however 12 of them contained only the apo enzyme, but in one dataset we were able to identify coenzyme A. The best apo-enzyme structure and the enzyme and cofactor structure is solved to 1.50 and 1.75 Å resolution, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The ID14-1 is equipped with a sample changer which made the crystal screening much faster. Most datasets were processed on site during data collection. The statistics for the highest resolution dataset from the apoand Coenzyme A-complexed crystals are presented below:</p><p>VsNeuD apo structure High quality data was collected to 1.50 Å. Space group was P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit cell of a=90.82 Å, b=94.82 Å and c=103.01Å. In total 100 degree data was used, and integration and scaling were carried out using XDS , and the structure factors were obtained with TRUNCATE (CCP4i). Overall the data were 99.8% complete, R-sym was 5.0%, I/σ I was 14.3, the multiplicity was 4.1 and the overall Wilson B-factor was 17 Å 2 . The structure was solved using MolRep of CCP4, using PglD (PDBid: 2NPO) as search model. For the refined structure the final R-factors are 18.3% (R-work) and 21.2% (R-free).</p><p>VsNeuD-Coenzyme A structure The structure is solved to 1.75 Å resolution. The spacegroup and unit cell parameters were only slightly different compared to the apo structure. The data set was 99 % complete, R-sym was 5.0%, I/σ I was 16.6, multiplicity was 4.4 and the overall Wilson B-factor was 23 Å 2 . The final R-factors are 18.6% (R-work) and 21.6% (R-free).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural features</head><p>The biological unit is a trimer, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, which is also the content of the asymmetric unit. Two of the three co-factor binding sites are occupied, and weak density can be observed at the third site. The substrate binding pockets contain two sulphate ions, and the structure contains two glycerol molecules. Several 2-mercaptoethanol molecules are participating in disulphide bridges with surface cysteines. In the apo structure one cysteine resides near the active site and is bound to a 2-mercaptoethanol molecule. In order to get crystals with bound cofactor we had to purify the protein without reducing agent, add some cofactor and then add the reducing agent. In the VsNeuD-coenzyme A structure the terminal sulfhydryl group of CoA is forming a disulphide bond with the same cystein residue near the active site. This disulfide bond is probably not relevant for the catalysis, and could be an artifact of the protein purification and crystallization in an oxidizing environment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We have solved the structure of VsNeuD to high resolution both in its apo form and in complex with its cofactor. The biologically relevant molecule consists of a trimer with each of the three substrate-and co-factor binding sites situated between two monomers. The carboxy terminal part of the protein monomers folds into a left-handed parallell beta helix. The structures are currently being compared to PglD from C. jejuni and the manuscript is in preparation. The NeuD protein is unique to bacteria and is a potential drug target. The structures may be utilized in a search for new and much needed antibiotics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional results</head><p>Totally for all projects 46 crystals were tested and 16 complete data sets were collected, so the use of the sample changer greatly improved our scanning to find the best crystal of a given condition.</p><p>For one additional project X-ray data were collected on MutT from Vibrio cholerae (VcMutT) a 15 kDa protein with 132 residues. MutT is a 8-oxo-dGTP pyrophosphohydrolase that hydrolyses 8-oxo-dGTP to 8oxo-dGMP and pyrophosphate, thus preventing incorporation of 8-oxodGTP into DNA. Two VcMutT crystals were tested, and two data sets to 2.35 Å and 2.45 Å resolution were obtained. All data were integrated with XDS, and statistics from the best data set gave an overall completeness of 99.3%, R-sym of 5.2%, I/σ I of 18.5, a multiplicity of 5.1 and a Wilson B-factor of 54 Å 2 .</p><p>The structure of MutT from E.coli has been determined by NMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abeygunawardana et al. 1995)</ref> but using this as a model for molecular replacement (MR) was not successful. Further, many other X-ray structures of proteins with 20-27% sequence identity to VcMutT have been tried with the MR programs Molrep, Phaser and BALBES. Still no MR solution has been found. Production of Se-Met protein is now underway and will hopefully help solving this structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
