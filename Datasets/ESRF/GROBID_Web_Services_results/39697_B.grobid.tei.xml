<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Cataract, eye lens clouding due to light scattering, is a leading cause of blindness and can result from protein condensation in hyperthermic and stressful conditions i,ii , when altered intermolecular interactions lead to dense phases that can compromise cell and organ function. Mammalian eye lens cells contain concentrated solutions of proteins called crystallins. Among those, the most abundant are the -crystallins, which are globular, polydisperse, multisubunit, 800 kDa proteins with a diameter of about 18 nm, whose interactions are well described with a simple hardsphere colloid model iii,iv .They exhibit a structural phase transition at nearly T C =45 °Cv , involving a quaternary structural modification and enhanced or reorganized hydrophobic surfaces. crystallin aggregation is induced by heat and Calcium ions 3 . In particular, heat modifies the quaternary structure of -crystallin 5 , and Ca 2+ decreases its thermal stability by promoting partial unfolding of the protein vi . Quantifying and understanding crystallin interactions and their impact on lens transparency, both in physiological and in hyperthermic conditions, is therefore an important step towards cataract prevention. Furthermore the characterization of the aggregation kinetics of the lens proteins is a fundamental tool in understanding the molecular origin of the disease, in which a subtle interplay between protein attractions, repulsions, and entropy governs condensation and the molecular mechanisms leading to protein aggregation.</p><p>We already followed by means of static and dynamic light scattering kinetics of aggregation in crystallin suspensions above and below Tc and we developed a kinetic model that describes the growth kinetics as a two step-process, a nucleation phase that leads to the formation of critical nuclei followed by an aggregation phase, in which the preformed critical nuclei are the basic aggregating units vii . The quantitative modeling of the kinetics by means of population balance equations (PBE) was combined with an extensive experimental investigation using light scattering techniques in order to determine the rate constants of both the phases of nucleation and aggregation (K nuc , K agg ) and the size of the critical nuclei of the aggregation. Plotting the rate constants in an Arrhenius plot has shown that the aggregation kinetics are strongly influenced by the transition temperature Tc , as can be seen by the jump in the expected exponential trends at 1/T=1/Tc (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). From the same plot we obtained the free energies associated with the activation processes and we found that at Tc there is an increase in the free energies of activation with temperature, of 1.1 Kcal/mol for the nucleation process and 8.2 Kcal/mol for the aggregation process. The structural transition of -crystallin is also accompanied by an increase in the dimensions of the critical nuclei from 23 nm to 27 nm, and by a contemporary decrease of their number. The overall result is the formation of a less number of larger and more stable critical nuclei. In summary, -crystallin above Tc exhibits a delay in the aggregation phase that preserves the lens from a premature opacification in hypertermic and stressful conditions, and can be related to the temperature dependent chaperone effect of the -crystallin already observed in literature viii .To study the effect of the transition on the Quaternary structure, X-Ray SAXS measurements were performed on crystallin suspensions at different temperatures (37-51°C).</p><p>The Intensity angular distributions are reported in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. It is evident, increasing temperature, the increase of the intensity in the low s region (s&lt;0.28 nm -1 ) togheter with the decrease of the intensity in the high s region (s&gt;0.28 nm -1 ). The change in intensity distribution displays a clean isosbestic point at s=0.28 nm -1 .</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> the gyration radius (black circles), molecular weight (open squares) and anisometry (open triangles) of -crystallin obtained with the software DAMMIN ix , that recovers the shape of the particle from the scattering distribution profiles, are reported in function of temperature. Below Tc the -crystallin oligomer shape has a bean-like structure, with an anisometry (I 1 -I 3 )/(I 1 +I 3 ) ~0.4 (where I 1 and I 3 are respectively the maximum and the minimum eigenvalue of the inertia tensor) . The radius is ~6.8 nm and the molecular weight is ~900 Kda. When T C is reached, there is an abrupt increase of the radius (~8 nm) and of the molecular weight (~1600 Kda). The anisometry is 0.3, therefore the shape becomes more spherical. The DAMMIN 3D structures under and above T C are reported in fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, respectively at the left and at the right of the red dotted line traced in corrispondence of T C . It is possible to estimate from the ratio between molecular weight and the volume of the particle the density of the oligomer , which is ~0.96 Kg/m 3 below T C and ~0.80 Kg/m 3 over T C . X-ray SAXS measurements, performed above and below Tc at different concentrations (1-20mg/ml) don't reveal significative changes in the quaternary structure. The quaternary structure transition is reversible, and the transition kinetic is still under analysis.</p><p>These data are in correlation with our light scattering measurements that highlited a peculiar behaviour of the self-aggregation of -crystallin. The structural quaternary modification, consisting in the formation of a bigger, but less-dense oligomer could in fact be linked to the protective mechanism that preserve crystalline and other unfolded proteins from aggregation. To gain further insights the first steps of heat and calcium induced aggregation below and above T C need to be investigated by SAXS. We will expect a sharp reduction in the strength and the range of the attractive potential of both the protein-protein and nucleus-nucleus interaction potentials in correspondence of Tc. This would mean that the structural transition at Tc is linked to an allosteric chaperone function leading to the stabilization of the critical nuclei, with the overall effect of preserving the lens from the premature protein aggregation.
