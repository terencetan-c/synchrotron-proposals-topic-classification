<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>CHIKV nsP1 in complex with RNA substrate</p><p>Experiment number: Beamline: CM01 Date of experiment: from: 26/10/2022 to: 28/10/2022 Date of report: 04/08/2023 Shifts: 6 Local contact(s): Dr. Michael Hons Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Rhian Jones AFMB CNRS UMR 7257 Juan Reguera AFMB CNRS UMR 7257 Report:</p><p>Cap structures are universally present in eukaryotic mRNA 5' termini, and are critical for RNA stability, processing and translation. Many viruses also append cap structures to the viral RNA during infection, allowing hijacking of the host translational machinery and for evasion of the immune response. Alphaviruses such as CHIKV encode a unique non-structural protein (nsP1) for viral RNA capping that forms a membrane associated dodecameric pore in viral replication organelles in the host cell. NsP1 caps the RNA via a noncanonical pathway where methylation of a GTP nucleotide precedes gunaylation of the enzyme and transfer of the m 7 GMP moiety to the RNA. To date, at the ESRF we have obtained structures of nsP1 in complex with substrates corresponding to the methylation, guanylation and nsP1-covalent cap formation of the pathway, but we are lacking a structure of the protein in complex with an RNA substrate. The aim of this experiment was to solve the structure of nsP1 in complex with an RNA substrate corresponding to the first 15 nucleotides of the CHIKV genome, that we have demonstrated is capped by the enzyme in vitro.</p><p>The experiment was performed by Dr. Michael Hons, who communicated with us via Skype about the experimental set-up. Two replicate grids of nsP1 with the RNA in 5:1 molar ratio (Quantifoil R2/2 gold 300 mesh with a graphene oxide coating) that had been pre-screened on a TALOS Artica were loaded into the microscope, in addtion to two replicates with a 5:1 molar ratio of the RNA plus capping substrates (SAH amd m 7 GTP). Michael set up one data acquisition from the grid with the RNA alone, and one from the RNA with the capping substrates using EPU multi-grid. The following parameters were used for the aquisition; 2 images were collected per hole at a magnification of 105,000 in super-resolution mode (corresponding to a super-res pixel size of 0.42 Å/pix and a physical pixel size of 0.839Å/pix), spot size 4, defocus range: -0.8-2.5m, exposure time: 1.8s distributed over 35 frames, with a dose of 1.02e -/Å 2 per frame. The mutli-grid set up has been enormously useful to the nsP1 project, allowing us to collect from a sufficient number of holes in the case of poor graphene oxide coverage, or collection of different datasets within a single session now that the camera aquistion rates are so rapid.</p><p>A total of 13,385 movies were collected from the RNA+substrates grid, and 11,295 from the second grid (RNA only). The motion corrected movies were imported into cryoSPARC for patch CTF correction, where movies with excessive drift, bad ice or CTFs where Thon rings did not go beyond 4A were excluded, yielding 12,363 and 8309 movies respectively.</p><p>For the RNA only dataset, between 139,000-228,000 particles were taken forward from different 2D</p><p>classifications, where a good distribution of partcile views were present in the dataset. Heterorefinement in cryoSPARC yielded only one major class, and different 3D classification and refinement strategies were performed with C1 and C12 symmetry with between 80-90,000 particles, yielding final reconstructions at 2.94Å (C12) and 3.4Å (C1) with non-uniform refinement. Unfortunately, all active sites in the dodecamer were empty, so we did not attempt to improve the resolution of the structure further using polishing or further focussed classification techniques.</p><p>For the RNA plus substrates dataset, between 120,000 and 180,000 particles were used for final reconstructions post 2D and 3D classification, from an initial 2 million picked particles. Again, unfortunately despite going to high resolution (2.7Å with non-uniform refinement and imposing C12 symmetry), no signal corresponding to the RNA could be found in any of the active sites.</p><p>We belive that it is likely that the enzyme binds to the RNA transiently, and that the capping reaction turns over rapidly in the presence of the substrates. In this case, we think that a structure with the RNA bound nsP1</p><p>will only be possible to achieve with cross-linking experiments, or by using an active site mutant. It is also possible that complexes with the other nsPs will reinforce binding of the RNA.</p><p>The data from the 3 mx cryoEM France BAG collections collected aside from this one have now been published in PNAS, where Dr. Michael Hons is a cofirst author (Structural basis and dynamics of Chikungunya alphavirus RNA capping by nsP1 capping pores, PNAS March 2023, vol.120.no.12 <ref type="url" target="https://doi-org.insb.bib.cnrs.fr/10.1073/pnas.2213934120">https://doi-  org.insb.bib.cnrs.fr/10.1073/pnas.2213934120</ref> ).</p><p>We thank the ESRF and all local contacts for their helpful advice and patience in data collections (particularly when working with graphene oxide grids!)</p></div>		</body>
