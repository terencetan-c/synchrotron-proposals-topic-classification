<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Our work focuses on the prion protein (PrP), linked to Creutzfeldt-Jacob and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). We have studied the molecular mechanisms and kinetics of ovine PrP (OvPrP) oligomerization over the past few years [1-4] using a combination of biophysical techniques. These studies have shown that OvPrP partially unfolds into 3 intermediate states, which aggregate independently into 3 distinct oligomers O1, O2 (very instable) and O3. The same pattern of oligomerization is obtained with the C-terminal globular domain of the PrP, namely ∆OvPrP. Furthermore we have identified a minimal region (H2H3) <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> involved in the PrP structural conversion and oligomerization leading to the same pattern of oligomerization as the entire PrP.</p><p>In the present study, SAXS has been used to determine the low resolution structure of each of the monomeric species (∆OvPrP and H2H3) and the different oligomers obtained from their oligomerization.</p><p>The following figures show selected data obtained for the monomeric species ∆OvPrP and H2H3 and oligomers from H2H3 domain using Svergun's ATSAS suite programs (GNOM, DAMMIN) <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p></div>

Fitting the data using GNOM enabled the determination of a Radius of gyration Rg=2.03nm. DAMMIN was used for the sturcture determination by averaging 10 independent runs.</p><p>SAXS data for the each oligomer have successfully been collected and we are still in the process of analysing the data. These data will help to construct for the first time an architectural model of monomer assembly into the oligomers. These preliminary results have been presented at the European Biophysical Societies Association conference in Genoa [6] (invited talk and poster -award for best poster) and will be presented at the XIV International Conference on Small-Angle Scattering 2009 (poster).</p><p>We have also carried out oligomerization experiments of selected mutants, for which the oligomerization pathway is selected and leads to the formation of only one oligomer. Preliminary data clearly show the progress of the oligomerization over time, but the set-up available was not fully adequate and will be optimized in future experiments, using a home-made thermostated 'kinetic cell'.</p><p>1.
