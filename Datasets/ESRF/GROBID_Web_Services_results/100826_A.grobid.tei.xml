<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this study was to understand the correlation effects in the unusual magnetic properties of ε-FeSi by means of temperature-dependent core-level and valence band Hard X-Ray photoelectric on spectroscopy. This system has a semiconductor-to-metal crossover at 300 K, as shown in the electric conductivity measurements and a magnetic susceptibility that rises nearly exponentially up to 500 K, where it reveals a broad maximum, followed by a Curie-Weiss law at even higher temperatures.</p><p>With the specially designed experimental set-up devoted to HAXPES and the sample manipulator equipped with a cryostat we were able to cool down the sample to 30K and afterwards with the heating stage able to heat the sample above 700K. We perform the temperature dependent High resolution Hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy starting from 30K to 700K, measuring at 30K, 70K, 250K, 350K, 450K, 500K, 550K, 700K. We measured at the valence band as well at the Fe-2p, Fe-3s and Fe-1s core level on ε-FeSi. We used a fixed photon energy of 12keV to ensure the access to bulk information.</p><p>Further data analysis of the results and correlation with the magnetic measurements must be done prior to being able to determine the degree of correlation between Si-sp Fe-3d interaction as well as the e-e repulsion in iron silicides. However, a first look at the result indicate that there is a correlation present.</p></div>			</div>
