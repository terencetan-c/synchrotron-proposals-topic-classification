<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In the investigation of the role of the catalyst synthesis method on the catalyst behaviour, two hydrotalcite-based catalysts have been produced. The first is a Mg(Al)Ox support to which Pd and Zn have been added via wet incipient impregnation. The second is a Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox catalyst in which Pd and Zn have been added in the preparation of the support, hence during precipitation. These catalysts are being investigated for ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. The active phase for this reaction is a PdZn intermetallic compound which forms during reduction of the catalysts at 823K. Via a variety of characterization techniques, it has been found that the first synthesis method gives rise to bigger, though still nanosize, PdZn particles. However, with a number of redox cycles, the particle size of the catalyst PdZn/Mg(Al)Ox decreases. The sample Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox has proven to have more stable particles, i.e., the particle size doesn't change with redox cycling and is constant at 4 nm. Before reaction, the catalysts are reduced or are exposed to a redox cycle of H2-O2-H2-O2-H2. Such, the effect of activation procedure has been investigated. It has been shown that only reduction is not sufficient to stabilize the catalyst and after regeneration, a higher activity is observed for both catalysts. The catalysts activated with a redox cycles give rise to the same activity after regeneration. During this XAS campaign, the structural difference between the synthesis methods are investigated and also the effect of redox cycling compared to only reduction. Such, more insight is obtained in the catalytic activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>For both the PdK-edge and the ZnK-edge and for both samples, the experiments as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> have been conducted: Furthermore, the effect of redox cycling has been investigated by reducing a sample for 1h and performing 12 cycles of 5 minutes reduction and 5 minutes oxidation, i.e., the total reduction time is also 1h.  Figure 4: Comparison of Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox and Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox after reduction at 823K in R-space at the ZnK-edge. red: ZnO, blue: Zn foil, green: Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox, purple: Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox Figure 5: Comparison of Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox and Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox after reduction and redox cycling at 923K in R-space at the ZnK-edge. red: ZnO, blue: Zn foil, green: Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox-after 1h reduction, purple: Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox-after 12 redox cycles, light blue: Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Oxafter 1h reduction, orange: Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox-after 12 cycles. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Comparison between calcined PdO,ZnO/Mg(Al)Ox and Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox</head><p>After calcination, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, both spectra resemble PdO. When comparing Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and 2b, the spectrum of Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox hasn't changed drastically. This is also visible in R-space from this catalyst (not shown here). For the ZnK-edge, the difference in E-spectrum is less pronounced. When comparing in R-space, see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, it can be seen that the same contributions are present, only in different intensities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Comparison between reduced PdO,ZnO/Mg(Al)Ox and Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox</head><p>The view changes after reduction, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>, where the spectrum of PdZn/Mg(Al)Ox follows the one of Pd foil, while the spectrum of Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox gives a profile corresponding with the one of PdZn <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Hence it can be argued that for the Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox, the intermetallic compound PdZn forms more uniformly. Also at the ZnK-edge, a larger shift from the metallic structure is observed, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Comparison of Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox and PdO,ZnO/Mg(Al)Ox after reduction and after redox cycling</head><p>When looking at the R-space spectra of the ZnK-edge, a difference is noticed between 1h of reduction and 3h of redox cycling (12 cycles of each 5 minutes reduction + oxidation). The peak which most likely corresponds with PdZn, i.e., at 2.6 Å, is larger for the cycled sample. Also for the incorporated catalyst this peak is more abundant, indicating a more uniform formation of the PdZn intermetallic compound.</p><p>Concluding, it can be said that a big difference is present between both samples, whereby the Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox gives rise to a more uniform intermetallic compound after reduction. Redox cycling has a beneficial effect on both catalysts regarding the intermetallic compound formation. These results will be used in a publication with working title 'PdZn active metal impregnation vs. incorporation for ethanol dehydrogenation'.</p><p>[1] M.W.</p><p>Tew, H.

Here, Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox resembles to PdO while Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox resembles the spectrum of a Pd foil. The former can be attributed to the incorporation of Pd in the hydrotalcite layers, thus surrounding Pd with oxygen atoms. In Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox, Pd is present on the surface in clusters, thus Pd-Pd are more expected. Less clear on the figure is a small shoulder in the edge of Pd for both samples, which indicates an atomic distribution of Pd in the layers or on the surface for resp. Mg(Al)(Pd)(Zn)Ox and Pd,Zn/Mg(Al)Ox.</figDesc></figure>
