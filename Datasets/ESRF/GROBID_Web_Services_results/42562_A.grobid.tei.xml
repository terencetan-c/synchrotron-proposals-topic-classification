<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report</head><p>Deep sea piezophilic organisms (organisms which grow well at high pressure) have to regulate and maintain the fundamental properties of their membranes in the face of extreme pressures. This homeostasis is achieved by altering the lipid fatty acid chain composition of their bilayer membranes in response to the external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . This process is vital to preserve both the basic integrity of the membrane and its micromechanics which are highly important for maintaining mobility and activity of the proteins, peptides and other bio-molecules which are embedded in the membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . It has been shown that mono-and poly-unsaturated fatty acids are crucial for modulating membrane fluidity, however the regulatory mechanisms which underlie this composition control remain poorly understood.</p><p>We are currently building a library of pressure-temperature phase behaviour data for lipid extracts from SS9, a piezophilic organism. This will allow us to further understand the regulatory factors which lead to lipid modulation in the membranes of these organisms. Further data is required to clarify this, however once complete, will represent the first study of the membrane properties which form a feedback mechanism for lipid composition in these organisms.</p><p>During this beamtime we have also taken a 'bottom up' approach by investigating the pressure dependent fluidising effect of modulating hydrophobic chain composition in model membrane systems. We have studied the phase behaviour of fatty alcohol and phosphotidycholine lipid systems as a function of pressure and temperature. The phase behaviour of 2:1 1tetradeconal, di-myristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in excess water was particularly interesting and was characterised from 40-70 o C and 0-700 bar. Pure DMPC forms a lamellar gel phase over these temperature and pressure regimes and hence any change in its phase behaviour on addition of other components can be attributed to these additives. Results show the formation of several liquid crystalline phases; an inverse hexagonal phase coexisting with two different, swollen, biocontinuous cubic phases (Q II P and Q II D ) is formed at relatively low temperatures and pressures. The formation of these structured with inverse curvature indicates that addition of tetradecanol increases the lateral stress in the chain region but additionally fluidises the model membrane, transforming the system from a gel to a liquid crystal structure.</p><p>Interestingly, whilst carrying out these experiments we observed formation of partially aligned inverse bicontinucubic phases, indicated by non-uniform distribution of intensity around diffraction rings. This has allowed us to index distinct diffraction spots and we have been able to find, for the first time, experimental evidence for an epitaxial relationships between the observed Q II P and Q II D inverse bicontinuous cubic phases. In addition, time resolved studies of the lamellar to inverse hexagonal transition in tetradecanol/DMPC has given important information about the Q II P is orientation. Analysis is ongoing to extract further results from these information rich data.
