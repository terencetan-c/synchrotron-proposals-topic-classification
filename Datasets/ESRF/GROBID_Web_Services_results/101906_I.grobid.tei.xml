<div><p>We obtained time at the <rs type="institution" subtype="infrastructure">ESRF</rs> <rs type="grantNumber">CM01</rs> to collect one of our target complexes (E. coli RNAP trapped at a transcription terminator). We used UltrAuFoil grids, which were pre-screened on a Glacios microscope. We had thus a pretty good idea about the grid quality. Our local contact was Gregory EFFANTIN. We have worked with Gregory before and he helped us to collect some of our best datasets so far. This was also true for this data. Sanjay DEY, a postdoc from the lab, joined for data collection.</p><p>We collected a very large dataset of close to 15000 movies. We were able to identify several functional states and an example for a transcription termination complex is shown below.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We had 2 days on the Titan KRIOS to collect data on an RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcription termination complex trapped at a socalled intrinsic terminator. When RNAP encounters this intrinsic terminator, it undergoes a conformational change and enters a paused state before releasing the transcript. The RNA transcript forms a hairpin structure, which is critical for RNA release. Unlike previous attempts, we used a non-natural base in the DNA template to trap RNAP precisely at the termination site after it has transcribed a roughly 100 nucleotide long transcript. This approach has disadvantages and advantages. The disadvantage is a much larger sample heterogeneity (e.g. some RNAP molecules are not escaping from the promoter region and are thus not reaching the region of interest on the DNA). The advantage is that we are able to see functional states that are not observed when this type of complex is assembled directly (i.e. without prior transcription of the DNA template). As a consequence of the larger sample heterogeneity and the larger set of functional states, we require much larger datasets than usual. This allows us to classify the different functional states and still reach high-resolution.</p></div>			</div>
