<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Operando PXD of novel cathode materials for Mg-ion batteries .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Purpose:</p><p>In rechargeable batteries based on intercalation-type cathodes, the atomic structure of the cathode material is one of the governing factors for the battery performance. During insertion and extraction of the active ion, any phase transformation or structural change will largely determine the features observed in the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves. Operando synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) is ideal for observing these structural changes while they occur during charging or discharging of the battery. Rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries is a relatively new type of battery, based on multivalent Mg-ion as the active intercalation ion. The Mg-ion possesses a number of properties which might serve a niche market for batteries: (i) higher volumetric capacity than Li-ion batteries due to Mg being a divalent ion, (ii) non-dendritic Mg-metal anodes, (iii) low cost, as Mg is very abundant in the Earth's crust <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Efficient Mg-ion intercalation cathodes are very important for a commercialization of this battery type. Our objectives in this experiment was to determine the structural changes in selected Mgintercalation cathodes in-situ to explain the electrochemical features observed in the galvanostaic charge/discharge curves.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials:</head><p>The main material selected as a Mg-ion cathode in this experiment consists of vanadium oxide nanotubes (VONT) stabilized by linear amines. The nanotubes consist of sheets of vanadium oxide curled up into rolls with amines in-between the layers 2 , and by using amines with different chain length the inter layer spacing can be tuned. This is expected to affect the electrochemically induced transformations. During this beam time, we also found time for a few prelimenary measurements on two selected Li-ion cathode materials. These were the vanadium fluorides, LiVPO 4 F and VO 2 F. Fluoride anion substitution is known to increase the redox potential and the thermal stability of the material. LiVPO 4 F has the triclinic Tavorite structure, but transforms to a monoclinic structure,VPO 4 F, during lithium extraction. Interestingly, it was found that LiVPO 4 F can intercalate an extra Li-ion at low potential to form monoclinic Li 2 VPO 4 F 3 .</p><p>VO 2 F is a novel Li-ion battery cathode material with a very high theoretical capacity, 526 mAh/g. This material has been reported to transform from its initial hexagonal structure to a cubic structure upon insertion of lithium <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . This phase transformation is irreversible when cycling the battery. We hoped to monitor the structural changes in LiVPO 4 F and VO 2 F insitu.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>The cathode materials were mixed with conductive carbon and a binder material, and then mounted in special PXD operando cells with the appropriate electrolyte and anode. Six cells were measured on in parallel while the batteries were charged/discharged, usually during 20 hours. The 2D-detector at BM01 allowed for a fast X-ray exposure time of 30 seconds, and a measurement cycle on all six cells took around six minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The diffractograms of the VONT reveals an expansion of the interlayer distance upon discharge and subsequent contraction upon charging, while the underlying VO x -frameworks of the walls are affected only to a minor degree by the intercalation. More structural detail and trends regarding inter layer spacing and electrochemical properties will be extracted as we progress with data analysis (Beamtime ended just one week ago).These results clearly demonstrate Mg-intercalation and extraction, and we hope to publish soon.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an overview PXD plot of the charging and discharging of LiVPO 4 F. The voltage vs. time plot clearly shows three plateaues, indicative of three two-phase systems. From the diffractograms it will be possible to estimate the percentage of each phase present, and correlate it with the charge/discharge curves. This result, as well as the result obtained for VO 2 F, is very interesting, and will be the basis for another beamtime application in the near future. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, 5230 Odense, Denmark.</figDesc></figure>
