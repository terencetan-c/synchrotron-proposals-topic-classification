<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Uranium L III -edge (17166 eV) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were recorded at room temperature (RT). We used XAS spectroscopy to determine the local chemical environment of U(VI) in cementitious materials: calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H phases) and crushed and fully hydrated hardened cement pastes (HCP).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In addition, Soddyite, Uranophane and CaUO 4 .H 2 O (phase X) have been measured as U(VI) references compounds. EXAFS data were reduced with the Iffefit software package. Theoretical scattering paths were calculated with FEFF8.0, including multiple scattering paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1a</head><p>shows EXAFS spectra for the most important U(VI) reference compounds (CaUO 4 .xH 2 O or phase X, uranophane and soddyite), employed as dry powder, together with those of U(VI) sorption samples (HCP/U(VI) and C-S-H/U(VI)), which were used as wet pastes. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> shows their corresponding Radial Structural functions (RSFs) calculated from Fourier transforming k 3 -weighted EXAFS functions between 2 and 11 Å.</p><p>The sorption samples were prepared by adding U(VI) solution to crushed-fully-hydrated HCP in ACW or C-S-H suspension, respectively, and subsequently equilibrating the suspensions for 30 days. After separation from the supernatant solution by centrifugation, the wet pastes were mounted in a Plexiglas sample-holder and sealed with kapton® tape. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1: k 3 -weighted experimental EXAFS data for selected U(VI) reference compounds and U(VI) sorption samples (a) and their corresponding RSFs (b), k range was taken between 2 and 11 Å -1 for all FTs. At low loadings, the EXAFS data showed that the chemical environments of U(VI) takenup by C-S-H and HCP are similar. Thus, one may conclude that C-S-H phases are most likely responsible for the U(VI) immobilization in HCP. Furthermore, at low loadings, the chemical environments of the U(VI) taken-up by C-S-H and HCP species are different from a soddyite-like or phase-X-like coordination environment but resemble that of U(VI) in uranophane. Future Outlook: The next step of this study is to determine the long term behavior of U(VI) in cementitious systems. The next XAS measurements will be dedicaced to U(VI) immobilized samples in C-S-H (with variable C/S ratio) and HCP with at least 300 days of contact time. The measurements will be done at RT.
