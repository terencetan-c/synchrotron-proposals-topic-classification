<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The hydroxyapatite (HA) structure of human dental enamel has been determined using powder x-ray diffraction, and is well established as space group P63/m with lattice parameters a=9.441(2)Å and c=6.878(1)Å. However, these values were obtained from measurements of powdered enamel collected from several teeth, and as a result any information on the spatial variation of the texture relating to the growth of the HA crystallites was lost. The HA crystallites are laid down by ameloblasts as nanorods which are grouped into cluster called prisms. Prisms are approximately 5µm in diameter and up to millimetres long and are arranged with their long axes at acute angles to the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ). After the maturation stage of enamel formation the ameloblast cells are broken down which means that, unlike bone, dental enamel in not able to regenerate itself. The orientation of prisms in enamel has been studied in the past using electron microscopy. Although this is a valuable tool for finding the prism shape and size in a particular plane of enamel, it is a qualitative technique and does not give quantitative information on the degree of alignment in different parts of a tooth in any detail. Understanding the spatial texture distribution and orientation of HA crystallites in the dental enamel of a tooth is extremely valuable in the clinical setting where this knowledge would improve cavity drilling techniques (for example to avoid weakening of the tooth by drilling at a particular angle which leaves the ordered enamel crystallite arrangement intact). In addition this crystallographic information ultimately will need to be more fully understood if functional, synthetic, biomimetic enamel is to be developed. For this XMaS experiment we were interested in characterising the texture in dental enamel in 2D and 3D from several different tooth-types to give us a complete picture of texture in the permanent dentition. In addition we compared fully mature enamel from a healthy molar tooth, to a specimen of immature enamel taken from an archaeological sample of a young human in order to determine whether textural analysis can provide useful insights into the maturation stage of dental enamel formation. The preliminary analysis of these data is given below.</p><p>Diffraction patterns were taken at intervals of 150 µm resolution for the immature enamel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) and 300 µm for the mature enamel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), for 500 µm thick tooth sections. The texture directions for the immature enamel and mature enamel tooth sections are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>) and b) respectively. It can be seen from this that for both immature and mature enamel the texture direction in the 002 reflection is approximately perpendicular to, and follows the contour of the enamel-dentine junction. From our knowledge of the structure of dental enamel it would appear that the preferred orientation in the 002 direction approximately follows the direction of the enamel prism arrangement. For particular tracks through the enamel, the FWHM of the intensity pattern around the Debye ring of the 002 reflection was used to evaluate the the degree of crystallite alignment -the higher the FWHM value, the less ordered the crystallites and vice versa. Taking each 2D diffraction image, the intensity was integrated over 360º in a narrow band containing the 002 reflection and plotted versus the azimuthal angle. The value for the FWHM was obtained by fitting the two peaks to a Gaussian peak shape. The results of this analysis have been plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>   The general trends seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> suggest that for both immature and mature enamel there is a higher order of crystallite alignment in a region ~300µm from the surface enamel, and that as you track deeper into the enamel towards the EDJ the crystallites become less ordered. Our preliminary results suggest that the texture distribution varies more in mature enamel than in immature enamel -possibly indicating a larger distribution of crystal sizes in the fully formed enamel as compared to the immature enamel. The results also suggest that on average the HA crystallites in the immature enamel are more aligned as compared to fully mature enamel. This may be due their particular stage of maturation where the needle-like crystallites have formed to their full length but not yet filled out in their width. Further interrogation of the data and further experimentation will be necesaary to confirm these findings. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Texture direction of the 002 reflection of HA in a) immature enamel and b) mature enamel</figDesc><graphic coords="3,57.00,135.12,245.88,143.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
