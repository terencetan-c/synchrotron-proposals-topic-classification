<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>has a strong activity on hydrogen storage materials, involving many national and international collaborators. The strong position of the group is to a high degree owing to the good access to neutrons for powder neutron diffraction (PND) using the diffractometer PUS at the Institute's research reactor JEEP II.</p><p>Synchrotron power X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) is an invaluable supplement to PND due to the superior speed and resolution. The data acquisition times are typically 3 orders of magnitude shorter using the MAR345 image plate at BM01A compared to PUS. This allows in-situ investigations of chemical reactions that we cannot possible follow with PND. The very high resolution offered at BM01B allows indexing and space group determination from complex structures where the problem with peak overlapping makes the task unmanageable with PND-or laboratory PXD data.</p><p>Thus, the predictable, long-term access to the beam lines at SNBL through the long-term projects 01-01-745 and 01-02-772, has been an invaluable supplement to our neutron diffraction facilities and the rest of our experimental activity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Phase transformations and thermal decomposition of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 and Ca(BH 4 ) 2 Mg(BH 4 ) 2 and Ca(BH 4 ) 2 are among the most promising materials for mobile hydrogen storage with 14.9 and 11.6 w% H, respectively, and predicted favorable thermodynamics. However, their decomposition pathways have not been experimentally determined.</p><p>A sample of α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 was heated from room temperature (RT) to 500°C with 2°C/min under dynamical vacuum in a quartz capillary fitted in a "Nordby-cell" at BM01A. Diffraction data were collected every 2 minutes on the MAR345 image plage.</p><p>Between 180 and 190 °C, most of the α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 is transformed to β-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . However, about 20% of the sample remains as α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 which only disappears slowly between 190 and 245°C without any further increase in the amount of β-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . Thus, this fraction of the α-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 appears to decompose without prior transformation to the β-modification. β-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 decomposes from about 245 °C under formation of MgO, Mg and traces of MgH 2 . The formation of MgO, which becomes significant above 280°C,indicates a leak in the system or reaction with the capillary. This unfortunately obscures the investigation of the pure decomposition reaction. No boron-containing phases are observed at any point.</p><p>The Bragg peaks from MgH 2 starts to increase above 360°C which is remarkable since it is well over the expected decomposition temperature. It may be explained by crystal size growth of nanosized MgH 2 which may be stabilized by encapsulation in MgO. The MgH 2 starts to decompose at 440°C. a One experimental session (12 shifts) for the long-term project 01-02-772 remains and will be performed in 22- Figure 2 Formation and decomposition of MgH2 at unusually high temperature.</p><p>A sample containing the β-and γ-modification of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 was investigated in the same way.</p><p>Parts of the γ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 is slowly and gradually transformed to β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 between 40˚C and 290˚C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). From 290˚C to 330˚C there is a faster transformation of the remaining γ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 to a new phase. This occurs without any change in the amount of β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>) and in a temperature range where no gas desorption is detected by Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD). Thus, it is assumed that the phase is a new modification of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 , tentatively named δ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 .</p><p>β-Ca(BH4)2 starts to decompose at 330˚C and the decomposition is completed at 380 ˚C. This correspond to the temperature range of the main gas desorption event measured by TPD. The disappearance of β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 is accompanied by a small increase in the amount of the new "δ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 " phase, formation of a second unidentified phase, and an increased amount of CaO.</p><p>The new "δ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 " phase decomposes in the temperature range 400-480˚C. This decomposition also involves gas release according to the TPD measurement.</p><p>The final crystalline products at 500˚C are CaO (again indicating leak or reaction with capillary), CaH 2 and the unidentified phase that was formed on decomposition of "δ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ". No crystalline boron-containing phases were observed. However, EDS/SEM show that the Ca:B-ratio is unchanged in the fully desorbed sample. Thus, the boron does not disappear as diborane gas but must be present in an amorphous state.</p><p>The intermediate phase CaB 2 H 2 (see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and final report for long-term project 01-01-745) is not observed in the in-situ measurement. This is probably due to its very high reactivity towards air. The formation of CaO indicates a leak and the CaB 2 H 2 may be oxidised immediately after it is formed.</p><p>The results are published in Journal of Materials Chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>  Phase transformations and thermal decomposition of alane Alane, AlH 3 , is interesting for hydrogen storage due to the very high hydrogen capacity (10.1 w%H) which is released at a moderate temperature (~120˚C).</p><p>Six structure modifications of AlH 3 are reported, but only four of them, α-, α'-βand γ-AlD 3, have been synthesised reproducibly. The crystal structures of α'-βand γ-AlD3 were determined from PND and high-resolution SR-PXD data from an earlier long term project at BM01B. It has been debated in the literature which modification is the most stable. Experimental studies indicate that α-AlD 3 is the most stable modification but DFT calculations indicate that β-is more stable than α-AlD 3 .</p><p>In the present investigation, the phase transformation and thermal decomposition of the modifications α-, α'-βand γ-AlD 3 are investigated by in-situ SR-PXD at BM01B. Heating rates of 1˚C/min were used. Quantitative phase analysis was performed for every recorded diffraction pattern see the phase evolution.</p><p>The phase evolution on heating for a sample containing a mixture of α-and α'-AlD 3 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. Decomposition of the α'-phase starts around 80 ˚C as seen from a decrease its relative phase proportion and onset of Al formation. The α-phase starts to decompose around 95˚C. The α' and α are fully decomposed at 140 and 160 ˚C, respectively. There is no indication of phase transformation from α-AlD 3 to α'-AlD 3 or visa verca. The thermal decomposition of γ-AlD 3 proceeds differently. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> shows the phase evolution for a sample of 90% γand 10% α-AlD 3 . From about there is clearly a transformation from γto α-AlD 3 as the amount of the former decrease while the latter increase correspondingly. From about 105˚C, the rate of reduction of the γ-AlD 3 decrease, but it increases again from 115˚C (see inset Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>) which coincide with the onset of Al formation. Thus, γ-AlD 3 decomposes directly to Al and D 2 from this temperature. All γ-AlD 3 has disappeared at 120˚C where the α-AlD 3 starts to decompose. The decomposition is complete at 150 ˚C. The reason for the different in the temperature range for decomposition of α-AlD 3 in the two measurements, are not clear.</p><p>The phase evolution of β-AlD 3 (90% purity, 10% γ-AlD 3 ) is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>. The β-phase shows a complete transformation to α-AlD 3 and no direct decomposition is observed. The αphase decomposes in a similar way as in the γ+α-sample. Interestingly, the γ-AlD 3 impurity shows a similar features as for the γ-AlD 3 sample above, with an inital rapid conversion to α-AlD 3 which slows down before a direct decomposition to Al and D 2 starts. Thus, this peculiar behaviour seems to be an characteristic feature for γ-AlD 3 .</p><p>From these investigations, it is clear that α-AlD 3 is the most stable modification among α-, α'β-and γ-AlD 3 .</p><p>The results are published in two papers in Journal of Physical Chemistry C <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Journal of Materials Science. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thermal decomposition of Na 2 LiAlH 6</head><p>The thermal decomposition of the pure and TiF 3 -doped Na 2 LiAlH 6 was investigated by in-situ SR-PXD at BM01A. Pure Na 2 LiAlH 6 and Na 2 LiAlH 6 doped with 2mol% TiF 3 decompose in a similar manner to LiH, NaH and Al from around 200 to 250°C. Samples with 10mol% TiF 3 behave quite differently. Firstly, a significant proportion (20mol%) of the Na 2 LiAlH 6 is decomposed when the TiF 3 is added, yielding Na 3 AlH 6 and Al. Moreover, the parts of remaining Na 2 LiAlH 6 decompose to Na 3 AlH 6 and Al before the final decomposition to NaH, LiH and Al. This is particularly pronounced in a sample that has been dehydrogenated and rehydrogenated (cycled).</p><p>A manuscript for publication of the results are in the final stage of preparation and will be submitted to Journal of Alloys and Compounds. Thermal decomposition of NaAl(NH 2 ) 4 Amides, NH 2 --containing salts, have been considered for hydrogen storage since the discovery of reversible hydrogen uptake in Li 3 N under formation of LiNH 2 and LiH. The amide NaAl(NH 2 ) 4 was prepared by direct reaction of NaAlH 4 and NH 3 under ball milling. SR-PXD at BM01A at ambient temperature showed a sample of high purity, as shown in the Rietveld fit in Figure 8 (the structure model was taken from literature).</p><p>The in-situ SR-PXD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>) was performed simultaneously with Raman spectroscopy (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>). There are no changes in the SR-PXD patterns, besides peak shift due to thermal expansion, until 110°C which correspond to the first where approximately ½ NH 3 pr. formula unit is desorbed (measured separately with thermogravimetry (TG) and mass spectroscopy(MS)). This leads to a complete amorphisation of the sample, as seen by the absence of Bragg peaks. However, the Raman signal barely change as a result of the amorphisation which means that the amorphous decomposition product also contain amide ions.

Thermal decomposition of Mg 2 (Fe 0.5 Co 0.5 )D 5.5 The synthesis and structural characterization of the quaternary deuteride Mg(Fe 0.5 Co 0.5 )D 5.5 is described in the report for long-term project 01-01-745. The thermal decomposition of the phase was investigated by in-situ SR-PXD at BM01B. The raw data are shown in Figure 11. Bragg peaks from Mg, which indicate the onset of decomposition, start to appear around 500K (230°C). Around 600 K (330 o C) the peaks from the quaternary deuteride start to disappear quickly and they have completely disappeared at 610 K. The decomposition products are Mg and FeCo solid solution.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><figDesc>According to the TG/MS measurements, there is a steady loss of NH 3 (reflected by a gradual decrease in the NH 2 Raman signal) from the first desorption event up to 230 o C where a new peak in the NH 3 desorption is observed. This desorption event is reflected in both the SR-PXD and the Raman data. The diffuse scattering measured by SR-PXD change its characteristics, indicating formation of a different amorphous substance. At the same time, the Raman signal corresponding to NH 2 -bending and stretching is lost. The TG/MS indicate that 2 NH 3 pr. formula unit are lost at this point.
