<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the experiment</head><p>Primary aim of this experiment was to determine the oxidational state of noble metal films, which were deposited in oxidizing environment. The oxidational state in the vicinity of the interface of the thin films to the ZnO-substrate was of special interest. Furthermore, the determination of the crystallography by surface X-ray diffraction was set to the agenda of experiment HE-3354.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample description:</head><p>For the experiment HE-3354, ten different thin films were prepared on previously annealed hydrothermally-grown oxygen-terminated c-ZnO substrates (purchased from Crystec). Subsequently, films were deposited using DC magnetron sputtering of Cu, Ag, Au, Pd and Pt. For each metal, one film was deposited in argon atmosphere and one film in a mixed argon/oxygen -atmosphere. The deposition conditions were adapted, such that the thickness of the all thin films was about 5 nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement conditions:</head><p>Generally, all measurements could be comfortably performed and the local contacts supported the work satisfactorily. Unfortunately, during the experiment on 6 am of the 18 th of august, a failure of the detector screen occurred, which made it-despite of the encouraged work of our local contacts-impossible to measure between the occurrence of the failure and noon of the next day. Nevertheless, all first priority measurements could be completed, as the measurement duration was adapted to the remaining time-with the consequence of reduced signal to noise ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obtained Results:</head><p>For each sample, the zinc L 2 2p 1/2 -level was measured. Furthermore, for each metal at least two core levels were measured. Finally, the oxygen K 1s level was measured in all samples. By adjusting the spectral position of the zinc L 2 2p 1/2 -level to its theoretical value-under the assumption that its energy remains constant -the exact beam energy was determined and all other spectra were adjusted accordingly. Please note that all samples were processed on ZnO single crystals of one batch and of one cut, which supports the latter assumption of constant zinc L 2 2p 1/2 energy. Nevertheless, the fact that the zinc L 2 2p 1/2 -level, which stems from the substrate, was measureable for all applied beam energies indicates that the deposited film thickness was in all cases too small. Additionally, calculations of the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of the used metals support this, yielding for all occurring kinetic energies to IMFP values close to or above the deposited film thickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The real IMFP can be expected to be even larger than the theoretical values, as the films, deposited at room temperature, include most likely voids and other open-volume defects. Thus the measured signal always represents an average over the entire film thickness.</p><p>550 540 530 520 510 500 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 r 10 keV r 12 keV r 14 keV 10 keV 12 keV 14 keV N 3 4p 3/2 519.4 eV binding energy (eV) normalized intensity (a.u.)

For both metals, at least some spectra permit to distinguish between the films deposited in oxidizing and inert conditions. But within the noise level of the obtained data, there are no obvious differences between the spectral position and the line shape of the films deposited under oxidizing and in inert conditions for the different beam energies. Yet, there is no possibility to deduce from these data whether the oxidational state varies with the film thickness or not, as all spectra probed the entire film. In case of the other metals, no significant and reproducible differences between the oxidized and the metallic film were observed.</p><p>3180 3170 3160 3150 3140 3130 3120 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 r 10 keV r 12 keV r 14 keV 10 keV 12 keV 14 keV M 2 3p 1/2 3148 eV binding energy (eV) normalized intensity (a.u.)

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, two materials with systematic differences between the films deposited in inert and in oxidizing conditions were identified. For both systems, it is necessary to carry out further investigations with increased film thickness and a higher number of beam energies in order to resolve the depth profile of the oxidational state in vicinity of the interface to the substrate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Spectra of the O K1s and the Pt N 3 4p 3/2 core level for the intentionally oxidized (reddish lines) and the metallic (grayish lines) Pt thin films.
