<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report for Cryo-EM time at ESRF January 2022</head><p>Summary: This continuing project aims to discover the activation mechanism(s) of this protein. Recently, (now published in eLife <ref type="url" target="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62021">https://elifesciences.org/articles/62021</ref> "Structural basis for SARM1 inhibition and activation under energetic stress") we determined the 3D structure of the SARM1 (sterile Î± and HEAT/armadillo motif-containing protein) ring octamer in an inhibitory conformation, and found that SARM1 is kept inactive through a 'substrate inhibition' mechanism, where physiologic concentration of NAD+ stabilizes the tightly packed, inhibited conformation of the protein. In this way, SARM1 activation is directly triggered by a decrease in the concentration of NAD+ (a hallmark of several stress conditions), and not necessarily by the introduction of an activating factor. SARM1 gains NADase activity upon the infliction of injury (axotomy), oxidative (mitochondria depolarization; oxidizing agents), metabolic (depletion of NAD+), or toxic (chemotherapy drugs) stress conditions. Whether and how all or some of these insults converge to induce SARM1 activation is still not completely understood.</p><p>In this session, to learn more about the activation mechanism of SARM1, we continue to investigate how SARM1 small molecule inhibitors that we have identified using high throughput screens affect the SARM1 structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental technique(s), required set-up(s), measurement strategy, sample details (quantity...etc)</head><p>Regular cryo-TEM single particle collection. Avoid thin ice, and focus on thicker ice regions, where fullyassembled particles can be observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prior to the January 2022 Krios ESRF session:</head><p>We had several sessions in CM01. Together, we were able to generate a 2.88A resolution 3D reconstruction of intact, ligand-free SARM1, and a higherresolution 2.68A structure of a NAD+ complexed SARM1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>January 26-28 2022 ESRF Krios data collection session report</head><p>In this session, Dr. Michael Hons, a collaborator of this project, screened through several grids that varied in protein concentration and ice thickness. Data collection was very good. About 10,000 movies were recorded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Processing report</head><p>We have used cryoSPARC v2 for CTF correction and particle picking, iterative 2D classification, and 3D ab-initio reconstructions and refinement. ~150,000 particles were used for 3D reconstruction. The 3D model resolution is better than 3.5A. This allows us to position all the secondary structure elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publications</head><p>Based on the results that we have collected in the previous two Krios sessions, we have published a manuscript A duplex structure of SARM1 octamers stabilized by a new inhibitor | Khazma T., Golan-Vaishenker Y., Guez-Haddad J., Grossman A., Sain R., Weitman M., Plotnikov A., Zalk R., Yaron A., Hons M., Opatowsky Y. | Cellular and molecular life sciences : <ref type="bibr">CMLS, vol.80, p.16, 2022</ref> </p></div>			</div>
