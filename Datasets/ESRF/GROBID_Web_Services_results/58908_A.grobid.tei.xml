<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the EXAFS measurements carried out for 4 consecutive days on the ROBL beamline was to determine the nature of the uranium (VI) species extracted by TODGA ligand (L) in dichloroethane, and under the synergetic effect of the ionic liquid (IL) <ref type="bibr">[C4mim][Tf2N]</ref>. This study is related to our work published recently <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> in which the stoichiometry of the extracted complexes were postulated. In pure DCE, the extraction of UO2(NO3)2L2 at low acid concentration and UO2(NO3)2L at high HNO3 concentration is expected, while in presence of ionic liquid, the complex formed is supposed to be of the form UO2(NO3)x(Tf2N)yLz, the stoichiometric coefficients needed to be determined.</p><p>A total of 15 samples obtained by liquid-liquid extraction under different experimental conditions were analysed at the U L3 edge. Typically, different nitric acid concentrations or IL concentrations were investigated. Reference samples with known ligands, nitrates, and Tf2N -stoichiometries were also investigated. 4 6 8 10 12 14 k 3 .chi(k) k (A -1 ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 FT (a.u) R UO2(NO3)L UO2L2 HNO3 1.2M//L/DCE HNO3 5M//L/DCE HNO3 1.2M//L+IL 0.1M/DCE HNO3 5M//L+IL 0.1M/DCE HNO3 5M + LiTf2N 0.1M//L/DCE Figure 2: EXAFS and corresponding FT spectra of analysed samples.</p><p>With its etheric oxygen (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), the TODGA ligand (L) is a tridentate ligand to uranium (VI). So a maximum of 2 organic ligands may complex in the uranyl equatorial plane. Actually, EXAFS results show that the uranyl coordination sphere is filled only with 2 ligands TODGA (L) for most of the investigated systems. Thus, the [UO2L2] 2+ entity is characterized when the extraction is performed in dichloroethane, with or without addition of ionic liquid. The exception is for extraction at high HNO3 concentration (5 M) in pure DCE, where the UO2(NO3)L complex is detected. This is in agreement with the postulated species.</p><p>As the extracted species need to be overall neutral, these EXAFS results show that the counter-anions, whether they are nitrate and/or Tf2N -, are in the uranyl second coordination sphere. This is quite unusual, as one would have expected at least one nitrate (which is a strong complexant to U(VI)) to be present in the first sphere. These results will be published before the end of the year in an international peer reviewed journal.</p><p>[1] –ê. N. Turanov, V. K. Karandashev, M. Boltoeva, C. Gaillard, V.
