<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>each session) Aim of the project: characteriza+on of the molecular interac+ons responsible for the influenza RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) subcomplex PA-PB1 nuclear import. RanBP5 is the karyopherin involved in PA-PB1 nuclear import, while the last RdRp subunit is imported via a different pathway. We have purified the stable RanBP5-PA-PB1 complex and collected cryo-EM data on the complex (24h, session 18-20/11/22), allowing the 3D reconstruc+on of RanBP5 to 3.8 Å. Unfortunately, we could not get a high-resolu+on structure of the full RanBP5-PA-PB1 complex, even though we saw a density for PA-PB1, it is rather undefined. To improve the data quality, we are exploring strategies to rigidify the complex and allow beYer posi+oning of PA-PB1 in regards to RanBP5. One strategy consists of adding a small ligand interac+ng with PA-PB1 to stabilize them. Ini+al cryoEM data collected on a Glacios microscope confirmed the presence of each partner and gave promising 2D classes, we therefore collected data on CM01 with this new sample (24h, session 10-12/05/23). Image analysis validated that the complex is formed with all the partners involved, however we could not achieve a resolu+on that allows the posi+oning of PA and PB1 without doubts in the EM map. Altogether, we need to further op+mize our sample to solve that intriguing biological ques+on.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample TET protease-session 18-20/11/22</head><p>The grids were previously screened on a Glacios microscope equipped with a 200 kV FEG, an autoloader and a K2-summit direct electron detector. A small dataset was then collected on one grid (~2,500 images) and processed with RELION, leading to a 3.1 Å structure of the TET protease complex. A similar grid from the same freezing session with the same protein batch was selected for the high-end data collec+on on CM01 Titan Krios with Quantum-K3 camera (plus the grid already collected on the Glacios as a back-up). The automated data collec+on was set up on the first grid with EPU: 11 suitable squares were selected, an acquisi+on paYern with 3 shots per hole was set up with AFIS ac+vated to minimise stage movement and speed up the data collec+on. The EPU run went through the night without any issues and 13,492 movies could be collected over the 24 hours allocated slot. Afer transfer of the data on a HPC cluster, processing of the data with RELION was performed: ~2.5 millions par+cles were ini+ally extracted (~185 par+cles per micrographs) and submiYed to several rounds of 2D and 3D classifica+on, allowing the selec+on of a subset of 243,691 par+cles of high homogeneity and high-resolu+on. Afer further CTF refinement and par+cle polishing rounds, a 2.1 Å 3D map was obtained, allowing to build unambiguously an atomic model of the complex. These results are part of a bigger study and will be incorporated in a publica+on in the coming months.</p></div>		</body>
