<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>GIXD on high-density silicon nanowire arrays was performed in the light of synchrotron radiation at an energy E=10.8keV (λ=0.1148nm) in order to verify the nanowire crystalline quality and orientation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> display SEM images from quasi perfect SiNW array growth confined in (a) and after etching of (b) the nanoporous alumina template, while Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> displays a θ-2θ diffraction pattern acquired near the (-440) reflection of the silicon substrate at q=5.657 nm -1 , with q as the scattering vector. Diffraction experiments were carried out using the GIXD geometry to avoid complete overload of the signal by the substrate. Two peaks are clearly visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, revealing the contribution of the substrate at q≈5.657nm-1 and one of the nanowires at a lower q. The presence of a nanowire peak ensures that the observed nanowires are crystalline and oriented in the same crystallographic direction than the substrate. Thus, the diffracting nanowires are in epitaxy with the substrate, and their crystallographic growth direction is [100] instead of the usual <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref> direction. The confined growth therefore leads to silicon nanowires oriented in a different crystallographic direction than their preferential one without affecting their crystalline quality. The fit of the GIXD pattern by Pearson VII phenomenological functions shows the presence of multiple satellite peaks on both sides of the nanowires' contribution. The presence of these satellites is due to the constant diameter of the nanowires within the array. The GIXD measurements also highlight the presence of a mechanical strain in the diffracting nanowires revealed by the difference in the scattering vector of the nanowire and substrate peaks. The lattice mismatch parameter expressed as ∆a/a=(a SiNWs -a Sub )/a Sub can indeed be related to the shift of the scattering vector q. Since the nanowires' diffraction peak appears at a lower scattering vector than the substrate one, the silicon lattice parameter is slightly dilated in the nanowires compared to bulk silicon. The calculated strain is ∆a/a=1.9×10 -3 which is one order of magnitude greater than for gold-catalyzed silicon nanowires which grew freely. This increased strain could be explained by the forced growth in the nonpreferential [100] crystallographic direction or by the effects at the interface between the growing nanowires and their Al2O3 growth template, but this still needs further investigation. We have also measure this strain for GeNW (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). The second part of the experiment has been devoted to the morpholgy investigation. On the GISAXS images of (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) and their profile according to qy shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we observe a large number of rods (respectively 5 and 18 rods). Such measurements was then performed for different in-plane angle of rotation µ. (table).</p></div>
