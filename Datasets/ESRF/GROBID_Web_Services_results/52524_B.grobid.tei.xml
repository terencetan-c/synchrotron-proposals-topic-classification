<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goal:</head><p>The experiment consisted of determining if and which secondary phases where formed in Fe-implanted SrTiO 3 for the implantation and annealing conditions that had been previously observed to result in ferromagnetic behavior (as well as for the annealing conditions that rendered the ferromagnetic samples nonferromagnetic).</p></div>

These concentrations were selected based on SQUID and Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements showing that: samples with x = 8% and x = 16% are ferromagnetic (after 700-900ºC annealing in vacuum ~1×10 -6 mbar) but no magnetic secondary phases could be identified; samples with x = 24% show a distinct ferromagnetic behavior and metallic α-Fe could be identified by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The observed ferromagnetic behavior was found to depend on the temperature ramping rate, which we isolated in two separate regimes ("fast" and "slow" are identifiers for two distinct multistep annealing procedures). In all cases, no ferromagnetism was observed after annealing in air at 1000ºC. For comparison, some aditional samples were prepared: S6 (16% Fe) was annealed in ultra-high vacuum (~1×10 - 10 mbar); S15 was implanted with 16% Co.</p></div>

The change in magnetic behavior upon air annealing could be correlated with the oxidation of metallic phases or the change in O-stoichiometry of already oxide phases. "Slow" annealing procedures were found to result in policrystalline regrowth of the SrTiO 3 implanted layer (amorphized upon implantation), contrary to "fast" annealing procedures which lead to a perfectly epitaxial recrystallization. This was found to affect very strongly the phase segregation behavior, as the grain boundaries in "slow" annealed samples appear to act as nucleation centers for additional oxide phases (e.g. SrFeO 2 ). We are currently preparting a manuscript on the identfication of these different phases, combining this SR-XRD data with complementary structural and magnetic characterization (Rutherford backscattering and channeling spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and Mossbauer spectrosocopy). We are also preparing proposals for SR-XRD experiments at BM20B and EXAFS experiments at BM26A (DUBBLE CRG) to further study two specidifc phases (γ-Fe and SrFeO 2 ) which are anomalous both structuraly and magnetically, and ideal model systems in which to investigate magneto-structural coupling.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): * Dr. Lino Miguel da Costa Pereira Prof. Dr. Kristiaan Temst Prof. Dr. André Vantomme * Dr. Enric Menéndez Dalmau (experimentalist, not applicant)</figDesc></figure>
