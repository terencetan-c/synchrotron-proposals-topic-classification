<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>INTRODUCTION -Heavy metal sequestration in specific subcellular compartments allows plants to tolerate as well as to accumulate high levels of heavy metals. Only a small number of plant species has evolved the ability to (hyper)accumulate high concentrations of heavy metals in aboveground parts. Recently, a new metallophyte species with substantial biomass, namely Gomphrena claussenii, has been described as the first Zn and Cd hypertolerant species belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. Using SEM-EDX and µ-PIXE we demonstrated that Cd, but not Zn, accumulates in Ca-oxalate crystals. The experiment was conducted to i) unambiguously confirm Cd deposition to Ca-oxalate crystals (overcoming interaction with potassium K edge in SEM-EDX and poorer cross-section for Cd-K line in µ-PIXE), ii) determine Cd ligand(s) in the crystal, and iii) resolve involvement of Ca metabolism in Cd tolerance in this plant species. EXPERIMENTAL -Plants were grown under controlled conditions in Clark nutrient solution with 100 µM of Cd and three external Ca concentrations (low, 0.1 mM; optimal, 1 mM and high, 10 mM). Fresh plant material was frozen in propane cooled with liquid nitrogen and cryo-sectioned at -25 °C. The measurements were performed using the SXM set-up equipped with cryostat. The excitation energy for the analyses was first set to 4.1 keV to record maps of Ca, K, Cl, P and S simultaneously and then the enery was set to 3.55 keV to access Cd-LIII. Finally, the Cd-LIII edge XANES spectra and Ca-K edge XANES spectra were recorded in different plant tissues (roots, stems and leaves) on Ca oxalate crystals. RESULTS -Two dimensional maps of roots, stems and leaves were generated first at E=4.1 to determine Ca hotspots which represented Ca oxalate crystals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, Ca in red, K in green and S in blue) and detailed maps on selected crystals were generated at the same energy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, Ca in red, K in green and S in blue), followed by mapping at E=3.55 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, Cd in red, P in green and S in blue). At each energy, XANES spectra were measured (40 spectra in total plus Cd compound references; selection of spectra is shown in Fig 1D ). Linear combination fitting using two references (Ca-Cd-oxalate and Cd-glutathione) confirmed our hypothesis that the majority of Cd was bound to oxalate (95% on average for stems, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> and 90% on average for leaves, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) and the remaining 5% and 10% in stems and leaves, respecively, was bound to S ligands. In roots, no Ca crystals were found and S ligands dominated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). There was no siginificant influence of different Ca concentration on Cd ligand environment in the crystals. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Localisation of Ca and Cd in Gomphrena clausenii tissues and Cd ligand environemnt in roots and in Ca-oxalate crystals in stems and leaves.
