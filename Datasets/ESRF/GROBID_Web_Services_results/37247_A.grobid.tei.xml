M. Beale (University of Utrecht) * Dr M. G. O'Brien (University of Utrecht) * Ms L Espinosa-Alonso (University of Utrecht) * Dr S. D. M. Jacques (Birkbeck Collage London) * Prof. B. M. Weckhuysen (University of Utrecht) Report:</p><p>During this experimental time we have continued our previous work (July 2007) and further modified and refined the multi-technique setup for collection of 1-dimensional tomographic data over a catalyst bed in operando conditions. We have also collected high quality WAXS data on the reduction of MoO 3 directly to MoO 2 and performed Rietveld analysis allowing us to study this conversion in substantial detail.</p><p>From our previous work we had already successfully collected a series of data on the reduction and oxidation of both iron molybdate and its component oxide MoO 3 . The 'open' nature of the catalytic cell allowed us to probe the catalyst bed along its length and combine a series of techniques (WAXS, Raman, UV-Vis, fluoresce and online mass spectrometry) congruently on the sample. However, the low vapor pressure of water (compared to the methanol) made it difficult to supply sufficient vapor to the catalyst to compare the effect of leaching (which is believed to be a key factor in the deactivation iron molybdate) under these two environments. In this current work we have developed a new pipe heating system which largely overcomes this problem and have now successfully recorded the flow of water vapor over the catalyst bed for 12 hours which will now allow for a direct comparison. Due to the number of techniques and the quantity of the data recorded in these experiments, the analysis of this work is still ongoing; however we believe that these measurements will result in an increased understanding into the effect of reactants and products on molybdenum containing catalysts.</p><p>In the second part of our work we collected high quality WAXS diffraction images from a single point within the catalyst using the high resolution 2D PIXIUM4700 detector. The specific conditions utilized in this reaction inhibit the formation of complex sub-oxides during reduction of MoO 3 and this, in combination with the quality of the WAXS data, allowed us to follow the direct reduction of MoO 3 to MoO 2 in very high detail by performing Rietveld analysis on each of the datasets recorded. In combination with UV-Vis, Raman and mass spec we can then detail the reaction occurring at the surface of the catalyst (Uv-Vis and mass spec) and within the bulk (Raman and WAXS). We believe the most important result of this work will be the fact that towards the end of the experiment, when bulk MoO 2 is observed forming, the Rietveld analysis of MoO 3 indicates an increase in both the bond length and thermal activity of one of the three unique oxygen environments (specifically O1) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This appears to indicate this is the most labile oxygen within the catalyst bulk during oxygen transfer via the Mars van Krevelin mechanism to regenerate the surface active sites. Indeed, this is supported by complementary changes in the Raman peak intensities, which indicate that the Mo-O1 bond is broken at a considerably faster rate than the others in the system (figure 2). Although work continues on this analysis and how the changes relate to both the UV-Vis and mass spectrum data, it is clear that an understanding of the oxygen involved in the anaerobic reduction of this catalyst would be of considerable importance as it is this oxygen which maintains the reactivity at the catalyst's surface.</p><p>In addition to this we were also able to obtain some data regarding the mapping of crystalline phases during the preparation of catalyst extrudates. These data will serve as a good foundation/preliminary studies for obtaining further information on these types of preformed objects during catalyst preparation.</p><p>(a) (b) MoO (a) (b) (c)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Variation in the bond length Mo-O1b (a) and the thermal parameter of O1 (b) during the reduction of MoO 3 .
