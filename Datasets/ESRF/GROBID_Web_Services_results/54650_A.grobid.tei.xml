The local contact and the beamline scientist (A.N. Fitch) were both very helpful and allowed to obtain the excellent results of this experiment. The 4 samples were collected at different temperatures, between about 100 K and 500 K with a liquid nitrogen cryostream. The aim was to check on their phase transitions in the measured temperature range, and to correlate that with their electric behaviour. The temperature at which structural phase transition occurs can, in fact, be tailored by means of the level of doping. The data were collected with the additional aim of studying the local structure of these barium titanates: the peculiar electric properties of these materials are likely to be due to an off-center displacement of the titanium ions within the octahedra (or the distorted 6 membered polyhedra in lower symmetry). Here is the comparison of data collected at two different temperatures: The phase transtion is clearly visible, despite the very small structural distortion that takes place, due to the very high resolution of the beamline.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,34.08,37.20,447.12,308.64" type="bitmap" /></figure>
