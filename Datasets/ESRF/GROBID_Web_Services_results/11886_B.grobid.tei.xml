<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This represents the final, summary report of our experimental measurements for the longterm project LS-1150. Three sessions were scheduled and used. Due to experimental difficulties that could not be surmounted (see below), we decided not to continue the project after Feb 2000, and did not schedule a fourth session.</p><p>The goals of the project were to determine the structure of the plasma membrane H + -ATPase from N. crassa in the presence and absence of vanadate, a transition-state analog. Although a molecular envelope had been determined for this protein using electron crystallography <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Auer et al., 1998)</ref>, the resolution was limited to ~20 Å perpendicular to the membrane and 8 Å in the plane of the membrane. Our goal was to obtain a structure at higher and more isotropic resolution and to pursue structure determination in different conformational states. Indeed, as the project began, our crystals yielded the highest resolution yet reported for a P-type ATPase. Plausible rotation function solutions were obtained using the EM structure as a search model, but the translation function searches had been unsuccessful. Thus, experimental phase information was required.</p><p>Based on preliminary measurements (LS-660 and LS-940), it was known that the crystals form in space group R3 and that frequently exhibited merohedral twinning, yielding an apparent R32 symmetry. Furthermore, only ~10% of the crystals screened yielded data to a resolution of ~6 Å. Finally, the data exhibited some anisotropy. To permit phase determination, these experimental problems needed to be overcome. Given the weak laboratory diffraction, the necessary screening could only be achieved in the context of a long-term project. In the first round of measurements, we identified crystallization conditions that increased the proportion of crystals diffracting to 6-7Å from 10% to 70%. Correction for the observed anisotropy of diffraction was straightforward. During all three visits, we identified conditions for the preparation of native, cross-linked, and heavy-atom soaked crystals with improved resolution and reduced twinning fractions, as judged by the statistical analysis of the intensity distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(French &amp; Wilson, 1978)</ref>. Our choice of heavy atoms was guided by knowledge of compounds that interact biochemically with the H + -ATPase or that had been used successfully in phase determination of other membrane proteins. Crystals were screened by collection and analysis of partial datasets (10-15°), which permitted identification and elimination of highly twinned specimens. In total, 97 pre-screened crystals were analyzed; twelve full datasets exhibited relatively low twinning, with a maximum resolution of 5.8 Å (using a limit of 30% for R merge in highest resolution shell). Despite reduced twinning fractions in those crystals from which full datasets were collected, in no case was it possible to identify heavy-atom derivatives based on isomorphous differences. A major problem was the variability of the twin fraction, which complicated comparisons with the native datasets. Anomalous signals were analyzed, but in no case could we identify derivatives by this method either. Finally, in an attempt to circumvent the twinning problem, computational untwinning was performed using twin fractions determined from the intensity distributions. Once again, neither isomorphous nor anomalous difference signals could be interpreted. Ultimately, it appeared unlikely that we could circumvent the twinning problems either biochemically or computationally. This made it high unlikely that we would be able to determine phases experimentally.</p><p>In summary, although we were able to solve the problems of highly variable diffraction limits and crystal anisotropy, the twinning problem could not be controlled. Following the 3 rd measurement period, the structure of the homologous Ca ++ -ATPase from rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum was determined at a resolution of 2.6 Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Toyoshima et al., 2000)</ref>. Molecular replacement with this model also failed to generate a solution vs. our native datasets. Given the much lower resolution limit of our crystals compared to the published structure and the persistent twinning difficulties, we decided to cease work on this crystal form and therefore to end the long-term project. We continue to pursue alternative crystallization conditions in a variety of ligand-bound states.</p></div>		</body>
