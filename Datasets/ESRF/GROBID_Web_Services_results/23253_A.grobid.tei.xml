Once completed, the original report should be sent, together with 5 reduced (A4) copies, to the User Office.</p><p>In addition, please send a copy of your file as an e-mail attachment to reports@esrf.fr, using the number of your experiment to name your file. This will enable us to process your report for the ESRF Annual Report.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The {111} Face of NaCl can in principle terminate in a Na + layer or in Cl -layer. Both terminations result in polar surfaces and should therefore have a high surface energy. The two symmetry related terminations lead to a very low step free energy. Such a face should be rough already at zero Kelvin and not present in the growth morphology.</p><p>We have recently discovered that when NaCl is grown in formamide (CH 3 NO) solution, the {111} face becomes more stable. It grows more slowly and appears as a flat facet in the growth morphology. The polar nature of the {111} face may lead to a reconstruction, as has been found on similar polar surface 1 . The Structure can, on the other hand, also be stabilized by the presence of the polar formamide.</p><p>Here we repport the surface structure of NaCl (111) in vacuum. Crystals, with nicely developed (111) faces, were grown from formamide-water solution. Measurements were performed using an X-ray the energy of 10 keV. The set-up consists of an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, which was coupled to a 2+3-circle diffractometer 2 .</p><p>The crystal was mounted in the UHV chamber with the surface normal in the horizontal plane. Compared with our first experiments in humid environments, the (111) surface was found to be a much flatter. The best results were obtained on as-inserted samples; annealing always led to rougher surface.</p><p>We were able to measure in total 171 reflection from ( <ref type="formula">01</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">21</ref>) rods and specular reflectivity measurements, with the agreement factor of 16% when averaged over all measured conditions. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and 2 represents structure factor amplitudes along ( <ref type="formula">01</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) respectively. According to initial analysis surface of (111) NaCl is not reconstructed in vacuum. The question of termination is not clear yet but it seems that Na + termination is the most likely. Data analysis is still in progress.</p></div>
