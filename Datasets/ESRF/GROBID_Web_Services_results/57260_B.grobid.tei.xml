<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background and objective</head><p>For this experiment we proposed to investigate the magnetisation dynamics within nano-scale magnetic elements by use of holography with extended reference by autocorrelation linear differential operator (HERALDO). The main objective was to obtain time-resolved images of the magnetic vortex cores gyration, induced by use of an RF pulse through a co-planar waveguide (CPW) as well as re-create a previously seen "double Landau" state and obtain images of its dynamics. Overall we were exploring gyrational eigenmodes as well as non-linear effects. In particular we aimed to explore the effect of different geometries on the magnetic dynamics whilst probing the limits of the technique for maximum temporal and spatial resolution achievable at the ID32 beamline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figures 1, 2a and 2b depict the experimental setup and procedure used within this experiment. Time-resolution was achieved by using the standard stroboscopic pump-probe arrangement where the master clock of the synchrotron facility (probe) was used to trigger the magnetic (pump) RF pulse used to initiate vortex gyration. A delay is introduced between these pump and probe pulses which allows imaging the different phases of the samples internal magnetic state at regular intervals. The facility was running in 16 bunch mode with a probe pulse period of roughly 170 ns, allowing sufficient time for vortex gyration to dampen before the next pump/probe pulse. By using a relatively large RF pulse width of 30 ns allowed us to excite gyration on both the leading and trailing edge of the pulse whilst still leaving enough time between each pulse for sufficient dampening to occur and maintaining the confidence for identifying the exact position of the probe pulse within the pump pulse.</p><p>All measurements obtained that utilised the applied bias field were made possible by the integrated electromagnet dipoles present in the chamber on the ID 32 beamline. This setup isn't available to us at any other facility, making ID 32 particularly valuable to us for these measurements. Also, other techniques (e.g. XPEEM) are unable to image with an applied bias field at all as it affects the backscattered electrons that carry the magnetic information within the sample.</p><p>The samples used are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, 2c and 2d. It consists of a single column of magnetron sputtered Permalloy (Py) squares (2000 x 2000 x 80 nm) along the central signal line of an integrated gold CPW. The CPW was fabricated using the standard electron beam lithography, thermal evaporation and lift-off process with the following parameters: 4 µm wide central signal line, 75 nm thick and 1 µm separation from the 35 µm ground tracks on either side of the signal line. These were chosen to suit the 50 ohm impedance of the signal generator and SMA cables used. The integrated CPW was connected via gold wire bonds to a standard CPW with an SMA connector. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> shows the position of the reference slit in the ground strip of the integrated CPW. The slit was milled through the entire sample stack (CPW/membrane/gold mask) via focussed ion beam (FIB) and were 6 µm long and on average 30-40 nm wide. The slit width generally determines the intensity of the interference pattern and the overall resolution of the reconstructed image. X-ray imaging was performed at 45° to the incident x-ray beam to obtain in-plane magnetic contrast within the sample. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the field-dependence of the magnetic state within the Permalloy square. As applied bias field strength is increased the vortex core moves upwards, eventually splitting into two vortices joined by a domain wall. Applied field direction was parallel to the x-ray beam, giving it an x (in-plane) and z (out-of-plane) component for our sample at 45°. The field was then increased to relatively very large values (~4.5 kG) to saturate the samples magnetic state before it was then slowly decreased to zero. As the field strength was decreased a 7-domain state with 2 vortices was consistently formed. This was repeated 3 times and each time ended with the same result. If the starting Landau state was of opposite chirality, the vortex core would move in the opposite direction but formed the same chirality 7-domain state each time. Imaging was done by setting the Kepco BOP 100-10MG power supply to a specific current, collecting images of the static state of the sample then repeating at different Kepco currents, first increasing sequentially to saturation then decreasing sequentially. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows a comparison between the simulated 7domain state and the state seen in the experiment. The domain sizes, domain wall shapes and vortex positions correlate well between the two images. Any differences can be attributed to a small remanence bias field.</p><p>The next data set was aimed at imaging dynamics of the Landau state with an applied bias field of ~260 G. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref> shows a series of images of the magnetic state within the sample at different delay points. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref> is a plot of the vertical position of the vortex core against the delay time introduced between the x-ray probe and RF pump pulses. We can clearly see the position where the x-ray and RF pulse begin to be synchronised (0 ns delay, was 167 ns on the RF generator). Maximum vertical displacement of the vortex core was about 142 nm (5.4 pixels) after a 3.5 ns delay between the RF and x-ray pulses.</p><p>These measurements were repeated with a lower bias field of ~90 G as well as a higher bias field of ~300 G. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> displays all measurements and a clear gyration is seen in each instance. A gyrational period of ~4.5 ns is seen for bias fields of 90 G and 260 G, however a shorter period is seen for the higher bias field of 300 G. This could be because as the core is stretched with the higher field, its tendency to return to its rest position is higher, resulting in a shorter period of gyration. In previous experiments using Py samples of the same size the period of gyration was 4.5 ns so there is good agreement between the results here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments</head><p>This is the first time the HERALDO technique has been used to gain high quality images of the fielddependence of nano-scale magnetic elements as well as obtaining time-resolved dynamics whilst using an in-situ bias field. The ID 32 beamline seems to allow us to get information on the samples domain structure as well as the domain walls and have this information separated in the real and imaginary components of the data. This has allowed us to see interesting domain wall structures like the aforementioned domain wall "bubbles" seen in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> with a 90 G bias field. We have also gained knowledge on the functionality of the beamline allowing us to optimise the various coherence-altering slits and undulator gaps to remove specific unwanted artifacts from the collected data and improve contrast of which the origin of such artifacts was previously not particularly clear.

The aperture is on the rear side of the Figure 3: Field-dependence of magnetism within the sample. a) Shows the initial state formed when saturating the sample with a negative bias field and slowly stepping up to zero. b) Once the bias field reaches zero the Landau state reforms, the core then moves upwards with increasing field strength and eventually stretches until it exits the sample and is fully saturated in one direction. c) Upon reducing the applied field strength a 2-vortex (a.k.a 7-domain) state is slowly formed. This state is reproducible as we repeated this hysteresis multiple times and every time this state was reformed.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematics of the HERALDO setup and sample structure.
