<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>After locating the sample position in the DAC, a two-dimensional grid was created by collecting still images of the x-ray diffraction patterns in various positions. Single crystal diffraction data were collected at several selected points of the grid. From multi grain single crystal diffraction data the praseodymium oxide peroxide Pr2(O2)O3 could be identified. Instead of being oxidized to its +V oxidation state, praseodymium retains the oxidation state +IV, while the oxide anions of praseodymium(IV) oxide react with oxygen to form peroxide. Pr2(O2)O3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn with only one crystallographically distinguishable praseodymium ion that is coordinated by ten oxygen atoms. Four of the oxygen atoms coordinating the Pr 4+ -ions are part of the peroxide anions, whereas the remaining six are oxide anions. The sublattice of praseodymium ions consists of a slightly distorted body centered cubic packing (bcc) in which the oxide anions fill tetrahedral gaps and the peroxide anion sits in octahedral voids.</p><p>In order to investigate the behavior of Pr2(O2)O3 at lower pressures, the DAC was decompressed in steps to lower pressure points at which more x-ray diffraction data was collected. The phase could unambiguously be identified at both 17 and 11 GPa by multi grain single crystal diffraction, allowing for the determination of the relation of structural parameters and pressure. At ambient pressure, Pr2(O2)O3 was no longer present in the cell as a result of its decomposition into other phases. The analysis of the remaining data points including PrO2 + O2 heated at higher pressures is still ongoing. The experimental goal of the present proposal was to investigate if praseodymium can be oxidized to its +V oxidation state with oxygen under high pressure. Instead of praseodymium, oxide anions of PrO2 are oxidized to peroxide. The goal was achieved, in the sense that it was proven impossible to oxidize praseodymium to +V at least at ~30 GPa. Moreover, this experiment sheds light on the chemical properties of oxygen under extreme conditions. Instead of its typical behavior as an oxidizing agent, here oxygen demonstrated a comproportionating reaction forming a peroxide in a reaction 2PrO2 + 0.5O2 = Pr2(O2)O3. This can have some implications for understanding the behavior of geologically relevant iron oxides. The data is currently being prepared for publication. Further analysis of data collected at higher pressures may reveal new exciting findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Coordination geometries of the peroxide anion (left) and the oxide anions (middle and right) in Pr2(O2)O3.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,365.13,205.44,126.85,132.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
