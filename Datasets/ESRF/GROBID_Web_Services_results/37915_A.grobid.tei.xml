<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental. The local atomic structure around cadmium in nitrate and chloride aqueous solutions was studied by XAFS spectroscopy at the Cd K-edge (26.7 keV) at temperatures 20 -450°C and pressures 1 -600 bar using an X-ray cell developed at the Institut Néel (Testemale et al., 2005). XAFS spectra of Cd aqueous solutions were collected in both transmission and fluorescence mode at BM30B beamline (FAME).</p><p>Results from the nitrate system. Two nitrate solutions were examined: 0.10m Cd(NO 3 ) 2 -0.10m HNO 3 and 0.01m Cd(NO 3 ) 2 -0.20m HNO 3 (where m denotes the number of moles of each solute per kg of water) at T = 20-300°C and P = 600 bar. Results from EXAFS spectra show that in the first atomic shell Cd is coordinated by 6 oxygen atoms at 2.28±0.02 Å with no detectable change with increasing temperature. These structural data are consistent with the octahedral Cd(H 2 O) 6</p><p>2+ cation in solution. At T ≥ 300°C, however, precipitation of CdO from solution is observed likely due to the enhanced Cd 2+ hydrolysis.</p><p>Results from the chloride system. Six Cl-bearing solutions were studied in the system CdCl 2 -HCl-NaCl-H 2 O with 0.04m, 0.77m, 0.12m, 2.30m, 2.55m and 5.23m of total chloride concentration. Two kinds of runs were performed: as a function of temperature (20-450°C) at 600 bar and as a function of pressure (600-268 bar) at 400°C (for 0.04m Cl solution).</p><p>Although EXAFS modeling shows that single scattering (SS) from O is much weaker than that from Cl in the first coordination shell of Cd, the inclusion of oxygen in the model for all spectra improves the fit significantly. Neither more distant signals from beyond-the-first atomic shells around Cd, nor multiple scattering evens could be detected within the spectral resolution.</p><p>EXAFS spectra modeling shows that at ambient temperature in all solutions the dominant Cd aqueous species are octahedral CdCl n (H 2 O) 6-n complexes containing from 1 Cl + 5 O (water molecules) in the 1 st atomic shell at the lowest Cl concentration (0.04m) to 4 Cl + 2 O at the highest Cl concentration (5.23m). The Cd-Cl and Cd-O distances at ambient temperature were found to be 2.48±0.03 Å and 2.33±0.03 Å, respectively. With increasing temperature, these octahedral-like species transform to tetrahedral-like as shown by changes in XANES spectra with increasing T, and confirmed by EXAFS modeling (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). At the same Cl concentration, the Cd-O distance does not change within errors with increasing temperature at least to 450°C (not shown), whereas the Cd-Cl distance systematically decreases (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). At the same T, Cd-O distance remains the same, whereas the Cd-Cl distance increases with increasing chloride concentration; for example, at 450°C Cd-Cl distance changes from 2.40±0.02 Å at 0.04m Cl to 2.46±0.02 Å at 5.23m Cl (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). At a given T, with increasing mCl, oxygen atoms in the first atomic cell are progressively replaced by chlorine atoms (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This increase of the number of Cl atoms with mCl confirms our solubility data (Bazarkina, PhD thesis in prep.) and existing thermodynamic predictions (e.g., Sverjensky et al., 1997), indicating that CdCl 2 and CdCl 3 are likely to be the dominant species in the whole Cl range.</p><p>Our single experiment at 400°C as a function of P (~density of fluid) shows that with decreasing P from 600 to 268 bar there is no significant change in XAFS and XANES spectra. In the whole density range</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>(0.6-0.2 g/cm 3 ) Cd is coordinated by 2.5±0.5 Cl atoms at 2.41±0.02Å and 2.5±0.5 O atoms at 2.33±0.03Å. These data are consistent with the formation of the neutral CdCl 2 complex hydrated by ~2 water molecules.</p><p>The solvation by water molecules of Cd chloride complexes at supercritical conditions may have important consequences for the Cd transport by hydrothermal fluids and volcanic vapors. Possible structural differences in the solvation between Cd and Zn aqueous complexes may probably explain the increase of Cd/Zn ratio in the low-density volcanic gases in comparison with dense hydrothermal brines at high T (Rubin, 1997).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and perspectives.</head><p>This first in situ measurement of the structures and stoichiometries of Cd species will be indispensable for the interpretation of our solubility data of CdO and CdS minerals (Bazarkina, PhD thesis in prep.) to derive the thermodynamic properties of the dominant Cd-Cl-H 2 O complexes in hydrothermal brines and vapors. Knowledge of the dominant aqueous complexes at the atomic scale will improve our understanding of Cd and similar metals (Zn, Cu, Hg) behavior in high T-P oreforming fluids and volcanic gases, and could potentially be used in metal extraction and ore treatment technologies.</p><p>References.
