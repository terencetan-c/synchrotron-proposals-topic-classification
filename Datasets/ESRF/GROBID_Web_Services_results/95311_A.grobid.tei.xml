<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Participants: Ericmoore Jossou (PI), Simerjeet Gill, Ian Robinson, Ana Suzana, Tadesse Assefa, Steven Leake In a 4-day experiment at ID01, we performed BCDI measurements of tungsten samples implanted with different doses of helium and krypton. The samples of 1.0 µm 3 tungsten were lifted out of the bulk using Focused Ion Beam milling and attached to silicon substrates using platinum. The sample was mounted by the beamline scientist; Dr. Steven Leake. To avoid radiation damage from the full coherent beam, we used different filters depending on the photon counts observed on the detector. Finding the Bragg reflection was not trivial because we the crystallographic orientation of the sample was not know a priori. To find the reflection, the beamline scientist calculated a series of delta and nu values which provide the compound 2theta given the detector has a 5.5 o solid angle. This strategy allows us to make scans on only the powder rings rather than everywhere.</p><p>Due to the need to reconstruct the full six-component strain tensor, we measured four BCDI data sets from noncoplanar Bragg reflections: (01 ̅ 1), ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">103</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">013</ref>) for the sample with fluence of 7.5×10 17 ions/cm 2 . For each reflection, the crystal was rocked from -1.5 o to 1.5 o relative to the reflection center in 200 steps with a 1.0 s exposure. This scan was repeated 6 times, aligning the sample to the X-ray beam center before each scan to compensate for drift. However, we observe drifts in the rocking curves (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) which may be due to drifts in the phi and eta motor. Overall, we are able to reproduce the curves for each Bragg reflections which is more important.</p><p>Reconstructions of the data have begun. The W-He diffraction patterns seem to reconstruct reliably and give reproducible cubic crystal shapes. Full strain analysis will help us determine and understand the role of He and Kr ion irradiation induced damage as function of dose in tungsten. Tungsten metals serve as model materials for studying effect of ion irradiation in metallic systems as they are single component materials with well-defined crystalline peaks suitable for elucidating strain</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
