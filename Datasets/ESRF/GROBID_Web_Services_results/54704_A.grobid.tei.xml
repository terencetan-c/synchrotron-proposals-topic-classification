<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal Code CH-4171</head><p>Proposal Title X-ray Magnetochiral Effect in an Enantiopure Molecular Paramagnet</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals and experimental method</head><p>The overall goal of the proposal was to observe the magnetochiral effect for the first time in a discrete molecule, Co 3 (dpa) 4 (MeCN) 2 X (where X = a dianion, 1). The experiment was divided in two parts. Firstly we planned to use room temperature XNCD at the K-edges of Co to select crystals of each molecular chirality (-1 and -1) and to verify that the selected crystals were indeed chiral and not twinned. The second part of the experiment was concerned with the XMCD and XMχD measurements at the Co K-edge in the presence of a magnetic field at cryogenic temperatures.</p><p>XMCD at the K-edge is proportional to the orbital magnetization, XMχD is a measure of orbital anapole or toroidal moment of the orbital currents, while the integral of the XNCD at the K-edge is proportional to the effective operator comprising both orbital magnetization and orbital anapole. Careful analysis of all dichroism spectra in the X-ray range should help us to elucidate the role of orbital magnetism in chiral molecular paramagnets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General considerations and XNCD measurements:</head><p>We brought with us crystals of opposite enantiomers of the linear trinuclear compound Co 3 (dpa) 4 (MeCN) 2 X (where X = a dianion, 1), formed by two different crystallization techniques (A and B). We observed that the crystallization technique A gave very thin crystals with a low signal response, while technique B gave crystals with an acceptable signal to noise ratio. We also observed considerable radiation damage to the crystals, and thus determined an X-ray flux where a compromise could be made between crystal degradation and signal to noise ratio. We also adapted the experimental sequence to normalize for radiation damage. Finally we were able to able to work out a proper mounting technique, using a five-well sample holder, immersion oil, and kapton tape.</p><p>We obtained reproducible X-ray absorption spectra on the K-edge of Co for at least two crystals of each enantiomer (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). By switching the polarization of the X-rays, and by examining the differences between the XAS spectra, we were able to obtain XNCD spectra confirming that the studied crystals were indeed chiral. Furthermore, we were able to verify that we indeed possessed crystals of opposite chiralities, based on the observation of opposite XNCD spectra according to the chirality of the crystal (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Thus the first goal of the project was met.</p><p>By mounting the crystals with the c axis either parallel (0°) or perpendicular (90°) to the X-ray beam, we could observe a clear angular dependence of the XAS as well as the XNCD spectra. It should be mentioned that the c axis of the crystal structure is coincident with the metal-metal bond axis of 1. When the c axis of the crystal unit cell was oriented parallel with the X-ray beam, we observed XAS and XNCD spectra such as those seen in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. However, when the c axis was oriented perpendicular to the X-ray beam, we observed different XAS spectra and XNCD spectra (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In particular, in the XAS spectra, we notice an increase in the peaks at 7711 and 7718 eV, and a decrease of the peak at 7727 eV, with respect to the spectra of the crystal oriented parallel to the X-ray beam. Furthermore, the XNCD spectra are quite different; most notably the single peak seen at 7715 eV in the parallel spectrum is split into four peaks in the perpendicular spectrum. Although we once again see opposite XNCD spectra associated with crystals of opposite chirality, the sign is reversed compared to what is observed when the crystal is in a parallel orientation (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). It should be emphasized that the visually apparent differences in the XAS (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> vs. Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) are due not to chirality, but to orientation, that is whether the X-ray beam is parallel or perpendicular to the metal-metal bond.</p><p>In order to confirm these preliminary findings, we studied the evolution of the spectra with respect to rotation around the y laboratory axis.</p><p>Starting with a crystal oriented with the c axis parallel (0°) to the X-ray beam (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>), and rotating out of collinearity with the beam (0°  45°), we observed a gradual increase of the XAS peaks at 7711 and 7718 eV and a decrease at 7727 eV.</p><p>Likewise, when we rotated a crystal oriented perpendicular (90°) to the X-ray beam towards collinearity (90°  45°), we observe a decrease of the XAS peak at 7718 eV and an increase at 7727 eV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XMCD/XMχD measurements:</head><p>After verifying that we had crystals of opposite chirality on hand, we turned our attention to the magnetic measurements. This experiment is done in the presence of a magnetic field (H+ or H-) and the presence of circularly polarized X-rays (+ or -). The XMCD signal is the given by the following equation: -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 7680 7700 7720 7740 7760 7780 Sample 10 () XAS (a. u.)

However, due to some technical problems (instability of the temperature, sample loss, and lack of helium, we were unable to collect a full data set at 17 T. We were not able to see a clear XMCD or XMχD signal based on these limited data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this project, we reached our first goal in obtaining XNCD spectra for both enantiomers of the chiral compound Co 3 (dpa) 4 (MeCN) 2 X. It should be mentioned that this is the first time that chiral compounds with metal-metal bonds have been enantiomerically resolved and is one of the few examples of XNCD on any kind of molecular compound. We were able to obtain XNCD for both enantiomers in an orientation where the c axis is parallel to the X-ray beam, and when it is perpendicular to the X-ray beam. We were also able to chart the evolution of the XAS spectra with angle. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain XMCD or XMχD spectra of the studied samples. It is unclear at this moment if the marginal preliminary data are a result of the small magnetic moment of the studied compound (S = 1/2 for Co 3 (dpa) 4 X). This point should be confirmed in the future. If the problems prove to be intrinsic to the compound, it may be worthwhile to investigate instead the more magnetic chromium analogue Cr 3 (dpa) 4 X (S = 2). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1.
