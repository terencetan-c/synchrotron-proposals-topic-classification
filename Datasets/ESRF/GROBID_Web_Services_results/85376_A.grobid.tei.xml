Experiments were carried out using a custom made in-situ cell, which was built for the described experiments. This cell enables in-situ studies of reactions in a threenecked flask up to 300°C and at energies as low as 5 keV, which is necessary for following the vanadium Kedge XANES. The aim was to elucidate the influence of different solvents and precursors on the products, and to study the evolution of V and Cu containing compounds during the heating. The cell was assembled, and mounted on a x-y-z-tilt stage during the first hours of the beamtime.</p><p>The first set of experiments included the synthesis of Cu-V-O compounds. Four synthesis (A, B, C, D) with varying amounts of reactants were carried out to follow the changes in XANES of copper and vanadium at the K-edges. These reactants are oleic acid and oleylamine; their total amount was 2 mmol, 10 mmol, 20 mmol, 30 mmol in A, B, C and D respectively. The procedures were variations of a synthesis developed by our group that resulted in the formation of different phases and in different ratios, specifically small amounts of β-Cu2V2O7, together with V3O5 and Cu, based on ex-situ XRD in our laboratory. The aim was to establish the mechanism of phase transitions and to elucidate the reaction path between the precursors to eliminate the bi-phasic products. The results from the V K-edge are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> while the results for the Cu Kedge are only discussed. The heat treatment consisted in a ramp to 280°C during ~30min, followed by a 30min soaking. By comparing the obtained data with our own references and those found in literature, it was concluded that during the process the vanadium reduces from the initial 4+ in VO(acac)2 to 3+/4+. This is accompanied by a change is in the local symmetry around V atoms, as can be seen in the decrease of the preedge peak signal at around 5470 eV at 260°C. From the XRD patterns, the synthesis product was identified as V3O5. A slight difference was noted in the XANES spectra between the products of synthesis A or B, and C or D. Lower concentrations of oleyic acid and oleylamine result in a slighly lower oxidation state of the product, and a decrease in the local symmetry judging be the intensity of the pre edge feature.</p><p>In the case of Cu K-edge, at the same temperature of 260°C we observed a shift from the initial Cu 1+ in the copper precursor to Cu metal. The products are Cu nanocrystals, which can be concluded by comparing the Cu foil reference with the final XANES spectra during the reactions. The pre-peak feature is higher in intensity, and the oscillations are dampened, which has been often reported as the influence of the nano-size crystallites on the XANES. Hence, in each case the major products of the reactions were V3O5 and Cu . The interesting observation from the XANES is that both reduction reactions, VO(acac)2  V3O5 and CuOAc  Cu occur simultaneously, which might mean one is involved in the other. We have performed two test reactions using the same process for the two precursors alone, to verify whether they interact. The products were analyzed by XRD at our laboratory.. The XRD patterns indicate a distorted V3O5 phase when the Cu precursor was absent. In the presence of the Cu precursor, the pattern is of much higher quality, and all reflections from V3O5 are observed. We observe almost the same products when the Cu precursor is absent, as in the case of the synthesis with both precursors present. This means that little or no interaction between the two precursors is taking place. Moreover, we do not observe the formation of any intermediates during the heat treatment, which might prevent the formation of a ternary phase. This issue can be addressed by the hotinjection method, but in this case it appears the problem lies elsewhere. Most likely, the observed reactions proceed due to the presence of oleylamine, which acts as a reducting agent, while oleic acid acts as a capping agent. The presence of oleylamine stabilizes the vanadium and copper containing species at a lower oxidation state, and the capping agent prevents interactions between them. These findings hint at the possibility of a modified strategy to achieve phase pure Cu-V-O nanocrystals. We plan to change the ligands and try to use a more reactive vanadium precursor, in order to ease the accessibility of the two reactants, and direct the raction towards a ternary phase formation.</p><p>In the second set of experiments we sudied the nucleation process of Cu nanocrystals by coupling XRD and XAS at the Cu K-edge. The synthesis is well established in this case, hence we chose it as a model system to study the capabilities of the developed in-situ cell. Four experiments were carried out, where we followed the structural changes occuring during the transformation of CuOAc precursor into ~10 nm ligand capped Cu nanoparticles. The thermal treatment consisted in a ramp to 180°C during 30-40min, a 30min plateau at 180°C, followed by another 10min ramp to 270°C and a 30min dwell time at this temperature. Peak shape examination hints at the presence of two major popoluations in terms of crystallite sizes. Rietveld analysis indicates a crystallite size of 6 and 18 nm. From the TEM image analysis we find a size distribution within these limits, with an avarage size of 10 nm. We observe no temporal evolution of the size of the Cu crystallites during the heat treatment. We propose that the set of reflections at 180°C comes from Cu nanoclusters which are an intermediate state during the nucleation. Dedicated experiments are planned to elucidate the mechanism of this non-classical nucleation.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: In-situ XANES at V K-edge during CVO synthesis A, B, and C.
