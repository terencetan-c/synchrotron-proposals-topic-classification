<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I -Context</head><p>The main goal of these experiments was to test the possibility to characterise thin layers of various material(s) during electrodeposition and oxidation and/or reduction by XRD using synchrotron measurements (ESRF-Grenoble-BM32). For that, a special electrochemical cell was developed in our laboratory, which was already validated for efficient electrochemical measurements. We have chosen to test this special electrochemical cell by studying the electrodeposition of thin layers of birnessite, and their electrochemical reduction.</p><p>Birnessite (nominally Mn 7 O 13 .H 2 O) is a major Mn mineral phase in many soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>These minerals have a layered structure formed by MnO 6 octahedra sharing edges. Birnessite compounds often deviate from stoichiometry due to the substitution of some Mn(IV) by Mn(III) or Mn(II), with hydrated alkaline cations (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ ...) in the interlayer that compensate the layer negative charge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. These alkaline cations, located in the interlayers, can be exchanged with other cations, such as Pb 2+ , Cu 2+ , Co 2+ , Cd 2+ and Zn 2+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Moreover, birnessite-type compounds readily participate in oxidation-reduction reactions via a surface mechanism (oxidation of Se(IV) to Se(VI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Cr(III) to Cr(VI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, As(III) to As(V) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>...).</p><p>Because of these unique sorption and redox properties, birnessite minerals are under scrutiny as major scavengers of trace metals in the environment. They also attract considerable scientific interest as inexpensive and non-toxic materials for hazardous waste remediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, rechargeable battery technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or chemical sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>Very few studies report the synthesis of birnessite as thin films by electrochemical synthetic procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, however, layers directly deposited on current collectors present very attractive potential applications regarding redox transformations. Previously, we reported successful electrodeposition of thin layers of various compounds onto SnO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> and birnessite in particularly, in soft conditions (without deaeration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, from a survey of the literature, one notes that the nature of birnessite depends greatly on the pH of the solution and that its formation is a very complex process <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. That is why, we focussed this study on the influence of medium on the electrodeposition of thin layers of birnessite (nature of cation: Na + , K + ; pH). We tested also the possibility to study the redox behaviour of these thin layers in various conditions, in particular, in absence or presence of Mn(II) ions in solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II -Experimental conditions</head><p>The electrochemical cell containing three electrodes was specially developed for synchrotron measurements in our laboratory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The The volume of the cell was evaluated at around 2 mL. The solution was introduced inside the cell by using a piloted micropump (mp5 and extended micropump control, Bartels, microtechnik) and circulated in continuous during electrochemical measurements. The best parameters to obtain reproducible measurements were: -Signal form: Sine -Frequency range: 20 Hz -Amplitude range V = 250 Vpp</p><p>In these conditions, the rate of flow was estimated at around 1.25 mL/mn. All electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature using a microautolab potentiostat / galvanostat system (Eco Chemie) controlled by a Dell Computer using the GPES software package (version 4.9). The crystal structures were determined in-situ during electrochemical measurements using synchrotron measurements (ESRF-Grenoble -BM32). The measurements were made at 20 kV (λ ESRF = 0.6192 Å). The ex-situ measurements were made in the cell in the air after only that the sample was rinsed by circulation of milli-Q water inside the cell (10 mn) before that the film of kapton was removed (same geometry). </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III -1 Preliminary measurement</head><p>We determined the main patterns of the substrate (SnO 2 ) alone in the air (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2A</ref>), and when the electrolyte solution (Na 2 SO 4 0.4 M) was in circulation inside the cell, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">2B</ref>), to evaluate the impact of aqueous solution on the quality of the signals. 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Intensity Angle (2 theta) 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 In the air, the main patterns of SnO 2 (JCPDS card 41-1445) were found with significant intensities, Table 1. The substrate must have a preferential orientation because the peak at 13.47 ° has a smaller intensity than in theory. As expected, the presence of aqueous solution in the electrochemical cell (thin layer around 1 mm thickness) degrades the signal, but the main peaks are always present proving that it is possible to determine the structure of crystallised compounds, Table 1.

The final amount of electricity (Q f ) is equal to 1.88 C after 10600 seconds and the value of pH final = 4.55. As reported previously, we observed a systematic decrease of pH. This evolution is in accordance with a significant oxidation of Mn(II) ions and a liberation of protons <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">3A</ref> shows I = f(t) and Q = f(t) (insert) during electrodeposition. The charge Q increases linearly with time suggesting that the electrooxidation of Mn(II) ions is a homogeneous process due to a good electronic conduction of the deposited film. During electrodeposition, systematic XRD measurements were recorded at After 0.35 C (t = 1770 s), a peak at 3.45 ° (d cal = 10.285 Å) appears on diffractogram.</p><p>According to the JCPDS card 32-1128, this peak could be attributed to the main pattern of buserite, which is a 10 Å hydrous phyllomanganate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. After 1.0 C (t = 5225 s), other peaks that can be also attributed to buserite, appear (6.85 °-14.47 °). The intensities of the peaks increase with time (or Q) and become very significantly at the end of synthesis principally for the main peak (3.51 °). In contrary, the intensity of the main peak of SnO 2 (10.61 °) decreases due to the formation of a covering thin layer on substrate (estimated to 2 µm). At the end of synthesis, we obtained a very homogeneous and adherent black film, which looks like exactly at thin layers electrodeposited in a classical electrochemical cell.</p><p>Another synthesis was made in the same conditions, but with a focus on XRD measurements in the range 2-5 ° for acquiring better signals (step: 0.05 ° -10 s/step, 600 s for each scan), Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> (Sample 3). All results are very reproducible: after 0.5 C, we observed always a significant peak characteristic of buserite (3.45 °-d cal = 10.285 Å). So, during the electrodeposition of thin layer of birnessite in aerated Na 2 SO 4 solutions at pH initial = 5.3, the alone intermediary compound that is formed in-situ is buserite.

Others synthesis were done in the same conditions (sample 6: Q f = 2.74 C in 17260 s -sample 7: Q f = 1.45 C in 10380 s), and similar results are obtained (Fig. 6, 2 -18 °, step:</p><p>0.05 ° -6 s/step), except on the peak at 14.5 ° (well defined for sample 6 -but one notes that the peak SnO 2 is well defined also). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III -4 Conclusion on the influence of pH</head><p>During the electrodeposition of thin layer of birnessite in aerated Na 2 SO 4 solutions at pH initial = 5.3 or 4.2, the alone intermediary compound that is formed in-situ is buserite with no significant difference on the position of peaks between these two values of pH, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref>. IV -Monitoring by XRD of dehydrate of buserite in real time.</p><p>So, during electrodeposition of thin layer of birnessite in aerated Na 2 SO 4 solutions, the alone intermediary compound that is formed in-situ is buserite. This compound is an unstable manganese oxide, Na 4 Mn 14 O 27 .21H 2 O that dehydrates to birnessite (Na 4 Mn 14 O 27 .9H 2 O or Mn 7 O 13 .5H 2 O) according to the literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> To verify this point, a same sample, which has been characterised previously in-situ, (sample 3) was characterised in the same cell but in the air after 48 hours, Fig.</p><p>8. The diffractogram obtained shows clearly characteristic peaks at 4.88 °, 9.83 ° and 14.44 ° (d = 7.272 Å, 3.614 Å and 2.463 Å respectively), which could be attributed to Mn 7 O 13 .5H 2 0, (JCPDS card 23-1239: 4.92 °, 9.83 °, 14.46 °) rather than Na-birnessite (JCPDS card 23-1046: 5.00 °, 9.97 °, 14.17 ° and 14.70 °). This result seems in good agreement with Lanson et al. who reported equivalent experimental valued of d at pH=5 (7.265 Å, 3.614 Å, 2.466 Å), and which suggested the transformation of Na-Buserite into H-Birnessite at this pH.

But, it was interesting to evaluate the time took for dehydration of buserite into birnessite. For that, we synthesised a thin layer of buserite, and after rinse (10 mn with milli-Q water), the cell has been not emptied but the film of kapton was removed to put progressively the thin layer in contact with the air (sample 10). During this step, systematic XRD measurements were recorded at constant times (2 -22 °, step: 0.05 ° -2 s/step, 800 s for each scan); only some scans are represented on Fig. <ref type="figure">9 A</ref>. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Intensity 2 theta scan 38 ech3 DRX ex-situ after 2 days 3 secondes by step 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3.2 3.6 4 4.4 4.8 5.2 5.6 6 Sample 10 measurements during dehydration scan 187: after 6 mns scan 189: after 32 mns scan 191: after 58 mns scan 193: after 84 mns scan 195: after 110 mns scan 200: after 175 mns scan 205: after 240 mns scan 210: after 305 mns scan 215: after 370 mns Intensity 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Sample 5 slow drying in the cell after synthesis scan 80 scan 82 scan 83 scan 84 scan 85 scan 86 scan 88 scan 89 scan 90 scan 92 scan 100 scan 101 scan 102 scan 104 Intensity Angle (2 theta) 1s / step 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 scan 105 scan 106 scan 107 scan 108 scan 109 scan 110 scan 111 scan 112 scan 113 scan 114 scan 115 scan 116 intensity Angle (2 theta) Sample 5 slow drying in the cell after synthesis 2s/step We had some problem in the beginning of this experiment for acquiring XRD measurements but we can still conclude that the dehydration of buserite into birnessite is relatively fast, because after only five minutes, the two compounds are present. In fact, the characteristic peak of birnessite appears (4.79 ° and 9.79 °) and only a shoulder corresponding to buserite is visible (scan 187). Moreover, reaction is total after only around twenty minutes.</p><p>We observed with time a slight shift of the main peak of birnessite from 4.79 ° to 4.  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Sample 5 slow drying in the cell after synthesis scan 117 scan 118 scan 119 scan 120 scan 121 intensity Angles (2 theta) 4s / step In a first time (Fig 10A), the intensity of the main peak of buserite (3.45 °) and the second peak situated at 6.85 ° decreases with time, and for this latter disappears totally after around 1000 s (scan 80 to scan 88). This value of time corresponds also to the enlargement and shift of the main peak of buserite from 3.45 ° to 4.03 ° (d = 10.285 Å to d = 8.805 Å respectively). After this step, only a slight shift of this main peak from 4.03 ° to 4.23 ° (d = 8.805 Å to 8.634 Å), was observed, with a very small decrease of the intensity. On the last scan registered after six hours with a better precision, Fig 10E, we can note that the main peak at 4.28 ° (d = 8.291 Å) is not situated to the value of the characteristic peak of birnessite (4.90 °, d = 7.243 Å) or buserite. It could correspond to a compound presenting an intermediary structure. This hypothesis is reinforced by the presence of others peaks characteristic of these two compounds, except SnO 2 peaks (10.61 °, 13.44 °, 15.04 °, 20.19 °, 21.2 °, 23.81 °, 25.055 °). In fact, a shoulder around 3.65 ° and the small peak situated at 7.07</p><p>° could be attributed to Na-buserite. The significant peak at 14.40 ° could be attributed to Nabuserite and birnessite, and the shoulder at 17.41 ° could be attributed to birnessite.</p><p>Some publications report that dehydration buserite/birnessite could be reversible. To verify this point, milli-Q water was reintroduced inside the cell with the micropump (Sine, 20</p><p>Hz, V = 250 Vpp). The XRD measurements presented on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">11</ref> show no significant change of the position of the peak (4.30 °). Moreover, the intensity stays very weak.  .018 0.02 0.022 0.024 0.026 0.028 0.03 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample 5 scan 141 scan 142 scan 143 scan 144 scan 145 scan 146 scan 147 Intensity Angle (2theta) 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 0.012 0.014 0.016 0.018 5 10 15 20 scan 47 Q=1.40C -2.30C Intensity Angle (2 theta) 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 5 10 15 20 scan 52 ex-situ Intensity Angle (2 theta)</p><p>V -Electrodeposition of thin layers of birnessite in presence of K + .</p><p>It was interesting to study the influence of cation on the nature of intermediary compound during electrodeposition.

At the end of the synthesis in a solution of K 2 SO 4 , only two peaks are visible in addition to those of the substrate, the first one around 4.79 ° (very broad), and the second one at 14.51 ° (well defined), which could be attributed to birnessite (Mn 7 O 13 ,5H 2 O).</p><p>An ex-situ diffractogram was also recorded in the air on the very homogeneous black thin layer, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12B</ref>.

Two new peaks appear at 9.80 ° and 14.66 °, which can be also attributed to birnessite, Mn 7 O 13 .5H 2 O (JCPDS card 23-1239). 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 5 10 15 20 Sample 6 scan 21: synthesis (6s/step) scan 29: reduction (E=-0.15V -6s/step) intensity Angles (2 theta) -3.5 10 -4 -3.0 10 -4 -2.5 10 -4 -2.0 10 -4 -1.5 10 -4 -1.0 10 -4 -5.0 10 -5 0.0 10 0 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 1 10 4 1.2 10 4 Reduction C3 E = -0.15V Ech 6 MnSO4 I (A) Time (s)</p><p>We can note that the peaks of SnO 2 are quasi disappeared due to a very covering thin layer.</p><p>In conclusion, during the electrodeposition of thin layer of birnessite in aerated K 2 SO 4 solutions at pH initial = 5.3, the alone compound that is formed in-situ is birnessite. Others syntheses were made (Sample 9 at 50 °C; sample 11 at 25°C), and similar results were obtained. This result could be due to a difference of hydration between Na + and K + cation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI -Behaviour of thin layers of buserite. VI -2 Reduction of thin layer in a MnSO 4 solution</head><p>It was interesting to study the redox behaviour of thin layer of buserite. For that, just after synthesis, a reducing potential, chosen according to a cyclic voltamperometric study made previously in our laboratory, was applied on the thin layer (E = -0.15 V) (sample 6, Q f = 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 Sample 6 -Reduction Ex-situ scan 33 and 34 scan 35 Intensity Angle (2 theta) Some changes were observed after reduction at E = -0.15 V (scan 29: Q reduction = -0.722 C to -0.815 C): the decrease of intensity of the main peak of buserite with a slight shift ((3.44 ° to 3.50 °), the shift of the buserite peak at 14.46 ° to 14.30 °, which could be attributed to hausmannite (Mn 3 O 4 , card JCPDS 24-734), a shoulder at 11.5 ° (which could be attributed also to hausmannite), and a shoulder around 7.0 -8.0 °. An ex-situ characterisation in the air was made on sample after rinse with milli-Q water during ten minutes, Fig. 14. Fig 14 Significant peaks are visible on diffractogram. In addition of buserite, hausmannite (Mn 3 O 4 ) is highlighted due to the characteristic peaks situated at 11.52 °, 12.97 ° and 14.31 °, and feitkneichtite (β-MnOOH, JCPDS card 18-804) with peaks at 7.60 °, 13.54 ° and 18.12 °(SnO 2 : 10.63 °, 15.07 °, 20.20 °, 21.32 °, 23.91 ° and 25.28 °).</p><p>After some minutes (around 33 minutes which correspond to the beginning of scan 35), a characteristic peak of birnessite is visible at 4.91 ° with a small intensity compared to a simple dehydration (see sample 10, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). This result could be due to the presence of hausmannite and/or feitkneichtite on the 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3 10 15 20 25 30 Sample 7 -Reduction in Na 2 SO 4 solution 0.4 M Ex-situ scan 96 scan 97 Intensity Angle (2 theta)</p><p>According in-situ measurements, we observed only a decrease of the intensity of the buserite peaks. No other peak of crystallised compound was observed. Moreover, a great decrease of the signal (95 %) was noted. After rinse with milli-Q water during 10 min, the electrochemical cell was opened and we can see that 80 % of the thin layer was removed. However, we can still analyse the solid by ex-situ XRD measurements, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">16</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig 16</head><p>In these conditions of reduction, buserite (3.58 °), birnessite (4.91 °, 9.91 ° (shoulder)), and feitkneichtite (β-MnOOH, 7.66 °) are identified. It appears normal that buserite or birnessite are always present because the Q f reduction &lt; Q f synthesis . In opposite of the previous reduction, hausmannite (Mn 3 O 4 ) is not present. So, we can suppose that this latter compound can be formed during reduction only if Mn(II) ions are present in the solution. The fact that the solid was dissolved could be due to the absence of hausmannite that could block the surface, as previously. But this point must be confirmed with other experiments before conclude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI -4 Behaviour of the thin layer towards the solution of MnSO 4 after synthesis</head><p>We wanted to know if the presence of Mn(II) ions in solution could induce an antidismutation reaction like: Mn(II) + Mn(IV)</p><p>2 Mn(III)</p><p>Some samples (2,3) stayed in contact with MnSO 4 solution after synthesis. It is difficult to conclude on XRD measurements if others compounds were formed due to an antidismutation reaction. These experiments must be completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII -Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>For the first time, the intermediary compound was determined during the electrodeposition of thin layer of birnessite on SnO 2 in function of medium. In aerated Na 2 SO 4 solution, and independently of pH ini (5.3 or 4.2), buserite is electrodeposited as an insitu intermediary compound. We have shown that the dehydration of buserite into birnessite is relatively rapid and takes less than 30 minutes if the thin layer is in the air. In aerated K 2 SO 4 medium, birnessite is directly electrodeposited.</p><p>We have shown also that our electrochemical cell can be used to study the redox behaviour of thin layer in various conditions. If the reduction is done in presence of Mn(II) ions, feitkneichtite and hausmanite are formed on the surface and the thin layer is blocked. In contrary, the reduction in absence of Mn(II) ions leads only to feitkneichtite, with dissolution of thin layer. The fact that the solid was dissolved could be due to the absence of hausmannite that could block the surface. But this point must be confirmed with other experiments before conclude.</p><p>These first experiments are very interesting and encouraging. This special electrochemical cell appears as a successful tool for characterising compounds during electrochemical measurements (electrodeposition, redox behaviour,…). It will be interesting to improve this cell for measurements in absence of oxygen. Indeed, the presence or the absence of oxygen modifies significantly mechanisms, as we reported during electrodeposition of thin layers of birnessite previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In future, numerous perspectives with iron compounds (siderite) and manganese compounds in interaction with various pollutants (dyes, pesticides, radioelement,…) can be studied.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>reference electrode was a microelectrode Ag/AgCl home made ([NaCl] = 0.1 M, E ref = 0.29 V/ ESH ).
