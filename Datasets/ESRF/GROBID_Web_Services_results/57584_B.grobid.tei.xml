<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Assessment of bone properties using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and SRµCT 57 cuboid femur cortical bone specimens were harvested at the mid-diaphysis site from 26 donors. All 57 specimens were first measured using Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy at LIB to asses elasticity estimation. SR-µCT was performed at beamline ID19, with a pixel size of 6.5µm, and an energy of 26 keV. Ideally, a monochromatic energy of 26keV was requested. However, due to limited time, we could scan 26 specimens using monochromatic beam (1 hour/specimen) and 31 using pink beam (15 mins/specimen).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: A typical 3D bone microstructure recorded by SR-µCT</p><p>After SR-µCT scanning, the 3D bone microstructure were reconstructed and the porosity and Degree of mineralized bone content (DMB) were calculated for all the specimens. The results show significant correlations between porosity and all the elastic coefficients were found (0.46&lt;R2&lt;0.80). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> demonstrates an example of such relationship between porosity and the elastic coefficient C11. For the 26 specimens scanned by monochromatic beam, significant correlations between DMB and the elastic coefficients (C11, C33 and C44) were found (0.23&lt;R2&lt;0.29). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> demonstrated the relationship between DMB and C11. However such correlations were not observed on the specimens scanned by pink beam, since pink beam may be not pure enough to accurately quantify DMB. However, we expect to critically improve the investigation by scanning the remaining specimens with monochromatic beam in a future experiment if possible.
