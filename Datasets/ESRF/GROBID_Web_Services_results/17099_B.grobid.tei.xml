Ph.D. Student Santiago Ramon-Maiques*. Ph.D. Student Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia CSIC Jaume Roig, 11. 46010-Valencia (Spain) Xavier Carpena* Ph.D. Student Instituto de Biología Molecular de Barcelona-CSIC Jordi Girona 18-26, Barcelona 08034, Spain Report: Although the time was allocated to project LS 1637, the Review Committees' comments clearly specified the following: "Allocation of 6 shifts under project number LS 1637, to include projects LS1638 to LS1642." These projects concerned the following topics: -Aspartokinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LS1638) -Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I from Rana catesbeiana (LS1639) -N-Acetyl-L-glutamate kinase from Escherichia coli forming complex with aluminium fluoride (LS 1640) -Carbamate kinase from Enterococcus faecium at high resolution (1641) -Pyrococcus furiosus carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase trapped in the act of catalysis (LS1642).</p><p>Since there were technical problems in the initial visit that prevented full use of the shifts allocated, 3 additional shifts were allocated on a later date for beam ID14 2.</p><p>All but one of these projects concern enzymes that synthesize acylphosphate bonds using ATP as phosphoryl donor. The phosphoryl group acceptor is either a carboxylate group (N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase and aspartokinase), carbamate (carbamate kinase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase) or bicarbonate (carbamoylphosphate synthetase I, which catalyzes two phosphorylation steps, one on bicarbonate and another on carbamate). The visits have allowed important progress to be made on our knowledge of three of these enzymes.</p><p>The Pyrococcus furiosus carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase has been characterised as a complex with ADP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>), and the nucleotide site has been delineated in detail (1). Despite hopes of having a crystalline "frozen" ternary complex including the other substrate, carbamoyl phosphate, no appropriate density for the latter has been observed, either in the presence of added ADP or in its absence. The enzyme structure of the pyrococcal enzyme not exposed to the nucleotide has resulted, nevertheless, in the observation of bound ADP, raising the possibility that the nucleotide were sequestered by the enzyme. The structural data has opened the way to other biochemical studies in which the reasons for such sequestration are analyzed.</p><p>A dead-end ternary complex of the homologous enzyme, carbamate kinase, with ADP and the carbamate analog phosphonoacetate has been used to try to delineate the site, at a resolution of 1.5 Å, for the carbamate moiety in these enzymes. ADP has been found with full occupancy in essentially the same location and position than in Pyrococcus furiosus carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, and a density that is not found in ligand-free carbamate kinase has also been observed and is highly suggestive of partial occupancy by phosphonoacetate of the carbamate site. The low occupancy possibly reflects the fact that phosphonoacetate is a poor competitive inhibitor with respect to carbamoyl phosphate with this enzyme (2). In this way, the entire substrate binding crevice has been nearly fully characterized.</p><p>The sites for the nucleotide and the acyl group substrate have been characterized to the highest degree in another homologous enzyme of the same family, N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase from Escherichia coli. Crystalline complexes of this enzyme with ADP (a product), N-acetyl-L-glutamate (the phosphorylatable substrate) and AlF 4 (an analog of the migrating phosphoryl group in the transition state), have yielded detailed information at 2 Å resolution of the central ternary complex and has provided a structural framework (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>) for proposing catalytic models for this enzyme family, which also includes aspartokinase, an enzyme for which the small crystal tested in the present experiments have not yielded yet relevant structural information (similarly, no structural information at atomic level has been obtained with crystals of frog liver carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, another enzyme that, in addition to phosphorylating bicarbonate and carbamate, binds N-acetyl-L-glutamate as an allosteric activator; or with a clinical mutant of human ornithine transcarbamylase, an enzyme that also uses an acylphosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, although in this case it is the carbamoyl group rather than the phosphoryl, what is transferred to the acceptor group, which in this case is the ζ-amino group of ornithine).</p><p>Overall, our projects in ESRF have been highly successful in providing new light into a structurally poorly known enzyme family (EC 2.7.2.) and in defining the active centers and substrate binding in enzymes of this family. Tangentially, they have shed light into the reasons for the thermostability of Pyrococcus furiosus carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase.</p><p>1. <ref type="bibr">Ramón-Maiques et al., J. Mol.
