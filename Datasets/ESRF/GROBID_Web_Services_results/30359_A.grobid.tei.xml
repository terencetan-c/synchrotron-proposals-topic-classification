<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Avian reovirus causes serious disease in birds, leading to important losses in the poultry industry. Nevertheless, not much is is known about their biochemistry and structure. Ten structural proteins have been identified in strain S1133: core components lambdaA, lambdaB, lambdaC, muA and sigmaA and external proteins muB, muBC, muBN, sigmaB and sigmaC. Four non-structural proteins are also encoded: p10, p17, sigmaNS and muNS. Avian reovirus is highly resistant to the antiviral effects of interferon and the dsRNAbinding sigmaA protein apparently plays an important role in that resistance. The sigmaA protein is capable of reversing the interferon-induced antiviral state by down-regulating PKR activity in a manner similar to other virus-encoded dsRNA-binding proteins. The avian reovirus cell-attachment sigmaC protein is a trimer, but the receptor to which it binds is unknown.</p><p>The Det7 bacteriophage belongs to the Myoviridae bacteriophage family (although it is not completely T4-like), but has an enzymatically active tail protein related to the P22 bacteriophage tailspike (Podoviridae family). It infects the bacteria Salmonella enteritidis, which is an important pathogen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SigmaA</head><p>We have measured native data on several crystals of sigmaA to around 3 Å. The spacegroup appears to be P1, with cell parameters of 103 x 130 x 144 Å and angles of alpha = 94º, beta = 105º, gamma = 98º, meaning the asymmetric unit probably contains many copies (between 6 and 15). Furthermore, all crystals show multiple lattices, therefore we have up to now not been able to solve the structure by molecular replacement. We are currently trying to improve the crystals on one hand and obtain heavy atom derivatives and selenomethionine derivatives on the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SigmaC</head><p>Avian reovirus fibre, a homo-trimer of the sigmaC protein, is responsible for primary host cell attachment. The protein expressed in bacteria forms elongated fibres comprised of a carboxy-terminal globular head domain and a slender shaft, and partial proteolysis yielded a carboxy-terminal protease-stable domain that was amenable to crystallisation. We tested various crystals of the receptor-binding domain of the avian reovirus fibre, sigmaC, at BM16. Most of these did not diffract, but one yielded nice data to around 3.5 Å (later extended to 3.0 Å at beamline ID23-1). The space-group was P6 3 22 with cell dimension 76 x 76 x 243 Å. We were not able to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the mammalian reovirus fibre sigma1, but have later obtained a different crystal form (P321, cell of 75 x 75 x 74 Å), which diffracted to higher resolution, and solved the structure of that crystal form using the MAD technique on a mercury derivative The carboxy-terminal globular domain has a beta-barrel fold with the same overall topology as the mammalian reovirus fibre (sigma1). However, the monomers of the sigmaC trimer show a more splayed-out arrangement than in the sigma1 structure. Also resolved are two triple beta-spiral repeats of the shaft or stalk domain. The presence in the sequence of heptad repeats amino-terminal to these triple beta-spiral repeats suggests that the unresolved portion of the shaft domain contains a triple alpha-helical coiled-coil structure.</p><p>The bacterophage Det7 tailspike Double-stranded DNA bacteriophage can be divided into several families, of which Myoviridae, T-even and similar phages, are one, and Podoviridae, T7-like phages, are another. The two families have a morphologically different tail. Myoviridae have a long, contractile tail with a base-plate, to which long and short tail fibres are attached. Podoviridae have a short base-plate directly attached to the neck of the phage and lack a contractile tail and long tail fibres. To this base-plate, six tailspikes are normally attached. The best-studied podovirus tailspike is that of bacteriophage P22. It is very stable parallel homo-trimer and its structure can be divided into three domains: an amino-terminal head-binding domain, a central beta-helix domain containing 13 complete beta-helix turns and a carboxy-terminal, partially intertwined, domain postulated to be important for pro-trimer formation. The amino-terminal domain is flexibly attached to the other two, which together form a rigid unit; the flexibility is thought to be important in the infection process. The central beta-helix domain binds to the bacterial host cell and is involved in hydrolysis of O-antigen. The O-antigen hydrolysis function of tailspike is thought to be too slow for being important in the fast infection step. Promoting lateral movement on the bacterial surface also does not seem a necessary step. Rather, the hydrolysis function is perhaps important for escaping bacterial debris after cell lysis.</p><p>A new bacteriophage, Det7, discovered in sewage (Regensburg, Germany), has morphology and sequences characteristic of myoviruses, but a tailspike with 50 % overall sequence identity to the podovirus P22 tailspike. In collaboration with Dr. Stefan Miller (Profos AG, Regensburg, Germany), we have crystallised the Det7 tailspike without the amino-terminal phage-binding domain and, after optimisation of the crystallisation conditions, obtained large crystals of hexagonal shape. At BM16, these crystals diffracted x-rays to around 2 Å, spacegroup R32, cell 100 x 100 x 329 Å (hexagonal settings). We solves its structure using the structure of the podovirus P22 tailspike (pdb-code 1TSP) on the beamline. We could extend the data to 1.6 Å later at beamline ID23-1, therefore refinement was carried out with this higher resolution data.</p><p>The bacteriophage Det7 tail tailspike is a parallel homo-trimer, virtually identical to the bacteriophage P22 tailspike. The structure contains an amino-terminal three-helix bundle (which connects to the absent phage-binding domain), a central beta-helical domain and a carboxy-terminal intertwined domain. Trimer contacts are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, as in the case of the P22 tailspike.</p><p>The central domain is composed of three beta-helical monomers, each left-handed beta-helix being composed of 13 complete turns. The beta-helices have a hydrophobic core and interact with each other through polar interactions. The "dorsal fin", consisting of residues 242-304, is inserted in the fourth helical turn, and the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth helical turn also have insertions. The dorsal fin flanks one side of the receptor-binding groove, the other insertions flank the other side. Residues reported to contact the O-antigen in the P22 tailspike are well-conserved: the active site residues are all identical, and in the other contacting side-chains there are only two differences, Trp365 of P22 is Tyr410 in Det7, and Ser237 of P22 is Asn282 in the Det7 tailspike sequence. Det7 tailspike binds octasaccharide somewhat less tightly than P22 tailspike; this could be due to Trp365 in the P22 tailspike active site being a Tyr in the Det7 tailspike. The structure of the carboxy-terminal domain, with its interdigitating and extensive intersubunit contacts, suggests that folding may start with this domain, as has been proposed for the P22 tailspike.</p><p>The Det7 tailspike is, after the P22 tailspike and the Shigella phage Sf6 tailspike, the third known tailspike structure. For P22 a transient disulphide bridge between Cys613 and Cys635 of a neighbouring monomer in the trimer has been proposed on the folding pathway and mutating the two cysteines to serine blocks tailspike assembly. The tailspikes of phages Det7 and Sf6 do not contain the cysteines involved, so they may have a different folding pathway.</p><p>A manuscript in which the structure is described is in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>.
