<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments reported here (SC-885, 1 st allocation period) are related to the first point of the experimental programme in the Long Term Project proposed by Vincenzo Lombardi: the measurement of the size of the axial motion of myosin heads (the working stroke) that drives force generation and filament sliding in intact fibres from skeletal muscle. During the previous LS-1403, thanks to the vertical collimation of the Xray beam at ID2, it has been possible to show that during the isometric contraction of a single muscle fibre the M3 reflection, due to axial repeat of myosin heads at about 14.5 nm, is composed of two closely-spaced peaks (at 14.67 nm, LA, and 14.46 nm, HA), due to X-ray interference between the two arrays of myosins in each thick filament <ref type="bibr">(Linari et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 97, 7226-7231, 2000)</ref>. The interference distance changes when the myosin head binds to actin and drives sliding of actin filament towards the centre of the myosin filament. The method has been used to characterise the motions of the myosin heads during the elastic response and the quick recovery of force following a step change in sarcomere length <ref type="bibr">(Piazzesi et al., Nature 415, 659-662, 2002)</ref>. Shortening steps reduced the ratio of the intensity of the HA peak over that of the LA peak, as expected for displacement of the myosin heads towards the centre of the myosin filament. However, we found that the reduction in interference distance was smaller than that expected from the imposed filament sliding and was mainly related to the elastic response. On the contrary, the increase in the interference distance induced by a lengthening step mainly occurred during the quick force recovery. These results can only partly be explained by taking into account the effect of filament compliance and indicate that the partner head of the same myosin molecule with one head attached contributes to the M3 reflection and rapidly attaches on stretch. The spatial resolution necessary for interference measurements was only possible with the Image Plate detector and this limited the precision of measurements of changes of intensity of the M3 reflection, since the time frames of different phases of the force transient had to be collected in different exposures separated by the long delay required for changing the Image Plate. In the experiments reported here we used a short camera (3 m) and the CCD detector for recording the intensity changes of the M3 reflection and of the weak actin-based layer line reflections during the quick recovery following shortening and lengthening steps.</p><p>Experimental protocol: Single fibres from the tibialis anterior muscle of Rana temporaria were horizontally mounted in a trough containing Ringer solution at 4 °C and at ~2.2 µm sarcomere length between a force transducer and a loudspeaker coil motor as already described <ref type="bibr">(Linari et al., 2000)</ref>. Patterns were collected on a CCD detector placed at the end of a 3 m camera at the plateau of the isometric tetanus (force T0), just before the length step (Ti) and between 1 and 3 ms following the step (T2). Adequate time resolution (2 ms) was attained by using two fast shutters (LS 500, ~20 µs switching time) in series in front of the preparation. Data were collected from nine fibres for either a step stretch or a step release of 4-5 nm, for which the T2 recoveries were 1.3 T0 and 0.8 T0 respectively. For each step, trains of 40 steps were imposed at the plateau of isometric tetanic contractions. The repriming protocol that made possible signal averaging from the train of steps provided that each step was followed after 4 ms by a similar step in the opposite direction and the cycle was repeated every 50 ms. To distribute the radiation damage, the fibre and the stage were shifted along the fibre axis by 200 µm after each tetanus by using a remote controlled motor. For each fibre, data from ten-thirty tetani per fibre were added up to a total exposure time of 10 s for the stretch and 6.2 s for the release. Data analysis was performed using Fit2D (by Dr A.P. Hammersley, ESRF) and Peakfit software package (SPSS Inc.). The radial integration limits were: for the M3 reflections ± 60 nm, for the M6 reflection ± 60 nm, for the 1 st actin layer line 26-7 nm, for the 6 th and 7 th actin layer line 60-10 nm. Results: At the end of quick recovery following the stretch the intensity of the M3 reflection relative to the intensity before the step (I M3 ) was 0.64 ± 0.06 (mean and S.D.), the intensity of M6 reflection (I M6 ) was 0.66 ± 0.06, that of the 1 st actin layer line ( I 1st ) was 0.93 ± 0.12. At the end of quick recovery following the release I M3 was 0.69 ± 0.02, I M6 was 1.31 ± 0.15, I 1st was 1.28 ± 0.03. There was no significant stretch/release-dependent change in the intensity of 6 th and 7 th actin layer lines. In terms of the crystallographic model of the myosin head, these results indicate that (1) in isometric conditions the orientation of the light-chain binding domains of both the attached and the partner myosin heads are near the perpendicular to the filament axis <ref type="bibr">(Piazzesi et al., 2002)</ref>, since both the execution of the working stroke elicited by a release and the reversal elicited by a stretch reduce I M3 , (2) the partner head of each myosin molecule that has one head attached is has enough order to contribute to both I M3 and the actin layer lines, so that its attachment on stretch, as suggested on the basis of mechanical and X-ray interference results, does not increase the contribution of myosin to the actinbased helical symmetry.</p></div>
