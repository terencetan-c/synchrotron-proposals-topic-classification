<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>In patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), serum phosphorus levels increase due to an insufficient renal excretion. To control serum phosphorus levels, phosphate binding agents are given orally, in order to reduce gastro-intestinal uptake of phosphate. A possible alternative for the currently used phosphate binders (aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate) would be lanthanum (La) carbonate. This compound has been shown to have excellent phosphate-binding capabilities, while it has a very low gastrointestinal absorption. We have previously shown however, that administration of La carbonate to CRF rats during 12 weeks, might induce a mineralisation defect in bone. Follow-up experiments have shown the mineralisation defect to be secondary to a severe phosphate depletion rather than beingthe consequence of a direct effect of La on bone. In previous experiments at the ESRF (LS-1709 and MD-53), we were able to localise La in rat bone. In CRF rats loaded orally with La at a 2 g/kg/day dose for 12 weeks, La was found to be localised at the edge of the calcified trabecular bone at ether quiescent and active sites, independent of the underlying type of renal osteodystrophy (Behets et al., 2005). Since La carbonate is currently being used in several clinical studies the aim of this proposal was to confirm these results in human bone.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Methods: Transiliacal bone biopsies of CRF patients taken in the frame of various clinical studies inverstigating the possible side-effects of La carbonate were examined. These were fixed in Burkhardt's fixative, and embedded in methyl-methacrylate. Samples from patients using La carbonate for up to 4 years were available, as well as follow-up samples of patients receiving the drug for 1 year, followed by a wash-out period of 2 years. Ten µm thick sections of these bone samples will be used for the analysis. Ultrastructural mapping of La in bone samples was performed using the ID21 Scanning X-Ray Fluorescence Microscope. The primary excitation energy was set to 7.2 keV, above the La L-edges, using a double crystal fixed exit monochromator. The beam was focussed to a microprobe (1µm) using a Fresnel zone plate. Simultaneous mapping of Ca, Fe and La was performed by choosing appropriate energy windows (Ca: 3.53 to 4.12 keV; Fe: 6.39 to 6.42 keV; La: 4.94 to 5.16 keV) of the multichannel analyzer.</p></div>
