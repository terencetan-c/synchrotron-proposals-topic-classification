<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In-situ analysis of internal strain evolution during heat treatment in sol-gel thermal barrier coatings Aims of this project are, to investigate, in «Sol-Gel» Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) deposited on NiPtAl bond coated superalloy substrates using the dip coating technique, (i) first, the origin of crack network formation while a standard heat treatment is carried out during the last step of their processing (sintering) (ii) secondly, the development of cracks and spalls during cyclic oxidation representative of service conditions. These TBCs consist of Yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) characterized by the tetragonal phase t'-ZrO 2 . By using the high energy X-Rays of ID15B, which allow very fast measurement speeds, the in-situ continuous monitoring of multiple Bragg peak shifts (link to elastic macro-strain) and broadening (sintering and micro strains) was successfully carried out during heat treatment.</p><p>A resistive heater with a sandwich geometry and with openings for the X-ray beams was mounted and diffraction signals were recorded simultaneously (in transmission) on the two-dimensional (2D) PIXIUM detector placed at 746,35 mm from the specimen. The energy was set at 87.1 keV. Due to very intense diffraction peaks from the substrate (which is a single crystal), we decide to focus our attention only on the TBC, by using a "grazing incident" geometry (the beam, with an appropriate size, is going, by transmission only through the TBC). The experimental setup is shown on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. 3. Measurement on "static" samples. So a large amount of nice quality diffraction data was recorded and are currently being analysed.</p><p>For example, the in-situ thermal heat treatment experiment allows a precise investigation of elastic strain evolution in the TBC during its sintering by studying the diffraction peak position shift as illustrates by figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> for the tetragonal (440) YSZ reflection. The corresponding Bragg positions were obtained by fitting the (440) reflection using Split Pseudo-Voigt functions. Note that due to this fitting procedure (that we are going to use for all the data set), the relative error on the peak position (Δd/d) is about 1x10 -3 . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> shows the strain (! T 440 ) evolution with temperature T of the (440) YSZ reflection. The strain ε T can be expressed as :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">! T hkl = d T hkl ! d 0 hkl d 0 hkl</formula><p>where d T hkl is the interplanar spacing of (hkl) planes at a given temperature T and d 0 hkl is the corresponding "stress-free" interplanar spacing (here the reference state for d 0 hkl is considered at the initial temperature which is at RT as we are interested in the relative Bragg peak shift).</p><p>The orange and pink straight lines belong to the theoretical "thermal" elastic strain (! Thermal = " l !T ) occurring during temperature changes (ΔT), i.e. respectively during heating and cooling. It was assumed that the linear coefficient of thermal expansion (α l ) of the YSZ was not the same as its value is strongly dependant to the porosity. So during heating (before sintering -porous YSZ) and cooling (after sintering -dense YSZ), a α l of, respectively 8.5x10 -6 °C-1 and 11x10 -6 °C-1 for the YSZ were used.</p><p>During heating, the elastic strain ! T 440 is clearly not linear and revealed different features: i) from RT to around 450°C the strain fluctuations could be related to the calcination of residuals organics compounds that are known to decomposed between 100°C and 400°C) ; ii) between 450°C and 700°C, even if some data are missing due to a loss of the beam, it seems that the strain is mainly linked to the thermal expansion ; iii) above 700°C, a high increase of the elastic strain/stress is observed (deviation from the linear thermal expansion). It can be explained by the sintering of the YSZ add to the growing of an Alumina Al 2 O 3 layer (between the subtract and the TBC). Indeed, during the sintering, the metallic substrate is opposed to the large shrinkage of the YSZ coating, thus leading to the development of this tensile-stress state. During cooling and particularly between 1100°C and 700°C, the elastic strain shows some fluctuation that could be explained by the cracks network formation leading to a substantial relaxation of the stresses in the YSZ. Indeed, due to the mismatch in the thermal expansions of the YSZ ceramic coating and the metallic substrate, on cooling the metal tends to contract more than the ceramic, leading to the development of stresses into the YSZ layer. Thus, it seems that these stresses are relaxed into the coating by microcraking (mainly above 600°C), which further develop into a crack network (as observed after the thermal treatment -inset of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). Concerning the FWHM evolution (clearly revealed on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), its study is under progress but we believe that the sharpening and intensity increase of Bragg peaks should be linked to the increase of the crystallite size and the decrease of the porosity during the sintering. In summary, this experiment was succesfull and the first analysis of the data are giving nice and interesting results.</p><p>Even if data anlysis (evolution of FWHM and peak positions for all the data) is still on going, these preliminary results show that this type of experiment and technique are very promising for the characterization of «Sol-Gel» Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs).</p><p>Note that we are currently preparing a paper to be submitted for publication in international journals and we also plan to submit an other proposal at ESRF to correlate these first analyses with ultra-fast micro-tomography for in-situ imaging study (porosity evolution and cracks formation and development).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Vanessa VIDAL* Institut Clement Ader -Mines d'Albi -81 000 ALBI -France Lisa PIN* Institut Clement Ader -Mines d'Albi -81 000 ALBI -France Report:</figDesc></figure>
