The investigated sample consisted of SiO2 particles of 50 nm radius immersed in a polymer melt -polypropylene glycol (PPG) of molecular weight 4000. In order to prevent aggregation, the silica particles were coated by alcyl chains resulting in a hard sphere system. A weight fraction of 30 % of silica particles was solved in PPG. The liquid sample was filled in a trough of 10 cm diameter. Cooling was achieved via a flow of liquid nitrogen through a heat exchanger underneath the sample cell.</p><p>The incident angle of the x-ray beam was chosen to be below the critical angle of total external reflection. The corresponding 1/e penetration depth of the x-ray beam is around 10 nm leading to a surface sensitive XPCS experiment. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows correlation functions measured at small values of the momentum transfer in the scattering plane at temperatures of 290, 265 and 250 K, respectively. Under those scattering conditions the scattering signal is due to overdamped capillary waves from the fluctuating surface. The measured relaxation rates Γ allow us to determine the viscosity of the colloidal suspension via η= γq/(2 Γ) where γ denotes the surface tension and q the wave vector transfer parallel to the surface. Taking the temperature dependent surface tension from ref.</p><p>1 we find that within the error bars, the viscosity of the pure polymer melt is identical to that of the colloidal suspension.</p><p>In a seocnd step we installed a CCD camera for detecting the weak scattering signal from the colloidal particles out of the scattering plane. This indicates that the surface motion of the particles is not simple Brownian motion. The exponent α found for the compressed exponential behavior is varying between 1.3 and 1.9.</p><p>For comparison an inset in fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>  In summary, we observed for the first time the surface dynamics of a colloidal suspension.</p><p>The scattering functions found are different from the correlation functions in the bulk regarding their compressed exponential behavior. In order to establish this result additional beamtime will be necessary.</p><p>[1] M. Sprung, T. Seydel, C. Gutt, E. DiMasi, A. Madsen, R. Weber, M. Tolan, Phys.Rev.

The image has been obtained by summing a time series of pictures extending over 20 minutes where each single image was exposed 1 s. The speckle structure of the image is apparent. From the time series of the CCD images we determined via software analysis the intensity autocorrelation functions of the surface dynamics. Figure3(a)shows a surface correlation function taken at q=6 . 10 -2 nm -1 . The observed decay time of τ=17 seconds is in good agreement with the estimated value of 10 sec., based on the viscosity of the polymer and the radius of the particles. Figure3(b) displays the logarithm of the intermediate scattering function i.e. log(f(q,t)) versus time. In case of simple Brownian motion the scattering function is exponential which results in a linear slope. Here, however, we observe a so-called compressed exponential intermediate scattering function meaning that the scattering function decorrelates faster than exponential, i.e. f(q,t)=exp(-(Γt) α ) with α&gt;1.</figDesc></figure>
