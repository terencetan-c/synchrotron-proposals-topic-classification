<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Complex hydrides based on boron (borohydrides) exhibit extraordinarily high gravimetric capacity for hydrogen and are therefore potential candidates as hydrogen storage materials in mobile applications. However, a major drawback is the limited reversibility. Recent work on LiBH 4 + rare-earth (RE) borohydrides/hydrides (RE = Ce, Gd, Y,) composites shows good rehydrogenation properties of LiBH4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, especially when RE hydrides are formed in-situ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The (de/re)-hydrogenation properties of these reactive hydride composites seem to be strongly influenced by experimental parameters such as the ratio of starting materials and the use of back pressure vs. vacuum. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood and the decomposition as well as rehydrogenation pathways remain unclear.</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate in detail the reaction pathway during de-and rehydrogenation of nanocomposites of mechanically milled 6LiBH 4 + RECl 3 and 6LiBH 4 + RECl 3 + LiH for RE = La, Sm, Gd, Er and Yb. In the latter case LiH is added to the mixture after the first milling, resulting in in-situ formation of RE hydrides during a second milling. The selected RE-elements were chosen due to expected differences in behaviour as well as different structure types for the RE borohydride.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>All samples were heated at 5 K/min to 400 C under vacuum and under 5 bar H 2 pressure. After decomposition, a hydrogen pressure of 100 bar was applied, and after a dwell time of 20 min at maximum temperature, the samples were slowly cooled down to room temperature (RT). The experiments were conducted using a new high gas-pressure setup developed by IFE in cooperation with Yaroslav Filinchuk (Univerité Catholique de Louvain, Belgium) and the SNBL for use at BM01. The gas handling system (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is constructed by stainless steel Swagelok tubings and fittings, VCR connections and pneumatic valves. All parts are approved for pressures &gt; 240 bar, and preliminary tests showed no leaks when pressures up to 185 bar was used. The pneumatic valves are operated from a computer placed in the control room. This allows for fast filling and evacuation of the sample without the need to stop the experiment to enter the hutch. The sample is contained in a 1.1 mm sapphire (Al 2 O 3 ) single crystal tube and connected to the sample cell using 1/16 inch Swagelok fittings sealed with ferrules made of Vespel or graphite. The sample cell is connected to the gas rig using thin PEEK tubing and constructed so that gas comes from both sides. This prevents displacement of powder during hydrogen filling.</p><p>The reaction pathways during de-and rehydrogenation were followed by in-situ PXD. The two-dimensional PXD data were collected at the diffractometer PILATUS@SNBL, using the software Pylatus developed at SNBL. An exposure time of 10 s was used, and the capillaries were rotated by 20 during each exposure in order to improve the powder average. The wavelength was 0.6941 Å. The two-dimensional data were calibrated with NIST LaB 6 standard sample and then integrated into one-dimensional powder diffraction patterns with the program Fit2D.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to compare reaction patway and rehydrogenation properties for samples with and without LiH. Unfortunately, the experiment suffered from problems with the hot air blower which had to be moved from its position to change samples. By comparing the PXD and the DSC data it is clear that several of the samples reached lower temperatures than planned, and since LiBH 4 melts before desorbing, it is not clear if LiBH 4 was completely decomposed before rehydrogenation and cooling. Thus no conclusions can be drawn on rehydrogenation properties. However, very good PXD data were obtained for the thermal decomposition, revealing formation of several new intermediate phases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The work on identification and structural determination of the new phases is in progress and two articles are currently in preparation. An overview article describing the differences in decomposition pathway for the different samples is also planned.</p><p>The gas rig was used for the first time in this experiment. It performed very well, and is now available for users at BM01. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
