<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This experiment was run as remote access.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the experiment and scientific background</head><p>DNA polymerase III β-subunit, or Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a ring-shaped protein that encircles DNA. PCNA acts as a processivity factor, or sliding clamp, for a wide variety of proteins that act on DNA, including DNA polymerases, DNA ligase, endonucleases and glycosylases. PCNA is a dimer in bacteria, a homotrimer in eukaryotes and a heterotrimer in crenarchaea such as Sulfolobus solfataricus. So far, the structure of three bacterial PCNAs has been determined. The PCNA dimer forms a doughnut-shaped ring lined by 12 α-helices, with an opening big enough to accommodate dsDNA.</p><p>Deinococcus radiodurans PCNA (DrPCNA) is a 39.6 kDa protein with 362 residues that have a 29% sequence identity to E. coli PCNA and 28% to Thermotoga maritima PCNA. DrPCNA has been recombinantly expressed and purified with the aim to perform a comparative biochemical and structural study of PCNA and its interacting DNA repair pathway partners from the extremophilic radiation resistant D. radiodurans and the cold-adapted Vibrio salmonicida. The DrPCNA crystals diffracted to 3.6 Å resolution on the home-source, but the data was too weak for reliable space group determination. Even though the sequence similarity to other PCNAs is low, it is likely that molecular replacement can be used due to a common overall fold.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Numerous DrPCNA crystals were tested, but most of them diffracted only to 3.5 -4 Å. Finally, a few crystals were found to diffract a little better, and three datasets were collected -the best was to 2.4 Å and was 94% complete. The crystals belonged to the triclinic space group P1 with cell parameters of 71.3 x 76.4 x 83.5 Å 3 , a=103.5, b=107.1, c=111.0, and R sym was 5%. The structure was solved from the best 2.4 Å dataset by molecular replacement, revealing four monomers (two dimers) in the asymmetric unit. Refinement and analysis of the structure is now in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Many (&gt;10) crystals of antibiotic resistance protein NimB from Bacteroides fragilis (BfNimB) were also tested, and three full data sets were collected. The best was to 3.0 Å, the space group was found to be P6 1 22 or P6 5 22, and the data was complete. For this project we need phases and most likely bigger crystals in order to solve the structure, which is the aim for the next data collection time.</p><p>For another project data was collected on a mutant of the cold-active Vibrio sp. alkaline phosphatase (Helland R, Larsen RL, Asgeirsson B. 2009. The 1.4 Å crystal structure of the large and cold-active Vibrio sp. alkaline phosphatase. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1794:297-308). Here we got a complete low and a high resolution dataset from one crystal to 1.85 Å in a space group different than the published native structure, and the analysis of the structure is in progress.</p><p>The last project was on PtmG, a protein involved in the sialic acid pathway in Aliivibrio salmonicida, where we got a complete X-ray data set to 2.97 Å. The structure analysis is currently being worked at.</p><p>We encountered some problems at the start up of the remote access session, when we could not get mxCuBE to start. The addition of samples from ISpyB to mxCuBE had to be done by the local contact as it would not work from remote, and later on we had problems where the mouse would not work via the NX client. There was also a problem with the detector not working properly. About half-way in the shift a wavelength change at ID 14-4 halved the beam intensity. Towards the end of the shift the beam was lost for one hour as the whole synchrotron ring was down.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other</head><p>Nearly all of the allocated beam time was spent analysing the beamtime application protein DrPCNA. Time also allowed us to test three other proteins, all of which were safety declared. These were Vibrio alkaline phosphatase (Vap), BfNimB, and Vibrio salmonicida PtmG as described above in Results.</p></div>		</body>
