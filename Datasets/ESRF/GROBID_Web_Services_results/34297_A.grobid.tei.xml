<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background and aim of the study: Methacholine challenge (Mch) is routinely used as non-specific challenge to diagnose bronchial hyperreactivity, although its effect in the lungs and main airways as compared to a specific allergen challenge are not precisely known. Tobacco smoke is an increasing health problem in the world, and more information about the acute effects of tobacco smoke in the lungs is needed. Traditional measurements of lung function such as spirometry can at best provide overall assessments and do not give any insight into the localization and heterogeneity of airway response. We have introduced a novel CT imaging technique that uses synchrotron radiation to quantitatively image inhaled stable xenon gas within the airways with a high spatial resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bayat et al 2006)</ref>. Using this method, regional lung volume, ventilation, and airway luminal diameters down to 2 mm can be measured. The spatial resolution of this technique is the best available for regional ventilation imaging in small animals, and the structure of the lungs can be studied simultaneously.</p><p>The aim of these studies was to use new asthma model using sensitized rabbits, and compare images obtained with synchrotron radiation with results on overall lung mechanics obtained with the forced oscillation technique (FOT) <ref type="bibr">(Petak et al, 2006)</ref>. This animal model was used to study first the effect of Mch in the lungs, and compare the results to the effects of allergen provocation, and the results were compared to the results from healthy animals. Secondly, the model was used to study the effect of acute tobacco smoke provocation in the lungs, and observe how previous smoke provocation affects the subsequent Mch provocation.</p><p>In the first year total 3 of the experiments were performed and 47 shifts were used.</p></div>

Animals were sensitized to ovalbumine (OVA allergen) at ESRF. The imaging setup was modified because of new collaboration with groups from Geneva and Szeged using the FOT (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In this study we aimed to evaluate regional differences of the effects of Mch and OVA challenges. Imaging was performed using K-edge Subtraction imaging (KES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bayat et al. 2006)</ref>, 3 different Mch doses were used, and totally 28 animals were studied successfully. Experiment protocol consisted imaging at baseline, after 3 different Mch provocations, a recovery phase and an OVA provocation. An example of ventilation maps and changes in the main airways is presented in figure 2a and 2b. The results suggest that non-specific airway challenge with Mch has a predominant effect on the central airways, whereas a specific allergen challenge with OVA induces constriction in the central and peripheral airways equivalently. Correlation between images and information obtained from FOT is very good (figure 3a and 3b). These results have been presented in following conferences: L. Porra et al. Medical applications of Synchrotron Radiation conference, August 2007, Saskatoon, Canada. S. Strengell et al. European Respiratory Society conference, September 2007, Stockholm, Sweden. T. Janosi et al. European Respiratory Society conference, September 2007, Stockholm, Sweden. S. Bayat et al. October 2007, Biomedical Engineering Society meeting, Los Angeles, USA.</p><p>Manuscript is under preparation and will be published later (Manuscript 2007).</p><p>Experiment MD238/3: The third experiment concentrated on a new model to study the effects of acute tobacco exposure in rabbits.</p><p>Experiment was performed with collaboration with the division of atmospheric physics at the University of Helsinki. Healthy and sensitized rabbits were exposed to tobacco smoke, and simultaneously the particle size distribution of smoke was measured. After the smoke exposure, the animals were provoked with Mch and OVA as in the previous study. Total of 11 animals were studied successfully with the experiment protocol.</p><p>The results suggest that tobacco smoke causes unexpected dilatation in the airways in rabbit, and prevents later the constrictions caused by Mch infusion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Similar results have been reported earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alving et al. 1993</ref>) in pigs. The analysis is not completed, and more experiments are required to finish this study.</p><p>First results will be presented at European Respiratory Society conference 2008, and manuscript will be prepared later.
