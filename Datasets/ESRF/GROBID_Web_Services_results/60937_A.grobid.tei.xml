<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate and characterise the nature and morphology of an unusual tissue, possibly endochondral bone, in an exceptionally well-preserved fossil of Diplacanthus, a Middle Devonian "acanthodian" member of the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, and chimaeras). A secondary aim was to characterise the gross morphology of the head, jaws, and gill arches for comparative anatomical purposes. In the experiment we acquired two datasets: a higher resolution dataset of 0.55 µm targeting the structure of the tissues in a specific part of the head and a lower resolution dataset of 2.26 µm voxel size visualising the entire specimen's skeleton. Both of these datasets were successfully processed in VG studio Max and Mimics v16 (Materialise) respectively.</p><p>The high resolution dataset revealed that the tissue in which the skeleton of this animal is preserved is in fact not bone, but calcified cartilage. The dataset clearly shows that the tissue comprises an avascular matrix punctured by lacunae for chondrocytes. In places rings and lines of Liesegang, indicating incremental growth, can be observed. The lacunae appear to be organised into chondrons, as in living jawed vertebrates. This data provides the most detailed glimpse we have into the three-dimensional organisation of early jawed vertebrate cartilage, and provides a valuable comparative datapoint for those studying this and the evolution of other jawed vertebrate endoskeletal tissues, such as bone.</p><p>The low resolution dataset provided extensive three-dimensional information on the morphology of the jaws, gill arches, and braincase of Diplacanthus. Broadly speaking the morphology of the braincase, branchial arches, and jaws in Diplacanthus are similar to that of Acanthodes, the only other "acanthodian" in which these anatomies are fairly completely known. In itself however this provides valuable information on the likely phylogenetic relationships in early chondrichthyans, bolstering ideas of a separation between "Acanthodes-like" acanthodians, including Diplacanthus, as the sister-group to all other more shark-like chondrichthyans. Diplacanthus is only the third 3D "acanthodian" endoskeleton known to science and we expect it provide important data for early vertebrate comparative anatomists.</p><p>The results of this experiment are currently in preparation for submission as two separate articles: one on the structure and comparative anatomy of the cartilaginous tissue of Diplacanthus, and another on the gross morphology and comparative anatomy of its braincase, jaws, and gill arches. Meanwhile, full details, descriptions, and images of both of these datasets are available to view in the PhD thesis of Richard Dearden, which can be found at the following link. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 contain data from this experiment.</p><p><ref type="url" target="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14FynhCihUDo7LjE4XE6ZjlWmcphc9wso/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/14FynhCihUDo7LjE4XE6ZjlWmcphc9wso/view</ref> </p></div>		</body>
