Instead, the ex-situ samples were synthetised and sent to the local contact who performed in situ XAS and PXRD measurements together with 2 in-situ PXRD experiments.</p><p>In total, we have measured 27 samples at Zr-and Ce k-edges and at Ce L-edge, also at Ni and Co k-edge (XAS) plus the same samples in XRD. All the measurements were performed on MOFs so the experiment was related to the proposal although we were not able to carry out the in situ experiments.</p><p>The experiments are divided into 4 groups where each is expected to result in a publication:</p><p>1) Parent compounds (4 samples): effect of synthesis parameters and post-synthetic treatment on structure of Zr-MOFs. Additional characterisation is being performed now in-house (TGA, Raman, proton-NMR, BET surface area measurements). In-situ synchrotron PXRD was performed on one of these samples.</p><p>2) Zr/Ce-mixed MOFs : physical mixture -comparison of Zr-Ce XAS data of our preparation method to the method reported in literature. 3 samples are inlcuded inthis groups 3) Zr/Ce-mixed MOFs: synthesis of the mixed MOFs. These MOFs were synthetised (in house) adding Ceprecursor at selected points in time determined in our previous synchrotron experiment in BALDER beamline at MX-IV. This experiments includes 8 samples. The TGA data collected in-house indicate some differences in the resulting samples. Here, the local structures around Ce and Zr are being compared along with the synchrotron X-ray diffraction data.  For all the samples, at the moment data analysis and additional characterisation is in process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>4)</head><figDesc>Metal loading (12 samples): Ni and Co metals were loaded in different conditions on Zr-MOF. The data were obtained on Co-and Ni k-edges along with Zr edge. At present, the XAS data at the metal edges indicated a very low presence of these metals in the sampes (Figure1).</figDesc></figure>
