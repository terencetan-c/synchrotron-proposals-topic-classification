<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>At ID09B we have studied the light-induced structural changes in a single crystal of 4,4'-dimethylaminonitrostilbene (DANS):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">O 2 N N</formula><p>The hypothesis that we sat out to test was whether the unit cell expands as a result of the large dipole moment of the excited-state molecule. In hybrid mode complete sets of diffraction data were collected at time delays between the femtosecond laserpulse and the X-ray pulse ranging from -300 ps to 50 µs. The employed wavelengths were chosen so that the light penetrates the crystal to various degrees (λ = 400 nm, A = 1.2; λ = 560 nm, A = 0.55; λ = 600 nm, A = 0.1). The laser repetition rate was 1 kHz (giving rise to 1000 laser/X-ray sequences per second). For each of the wavelengths an initial assessment of the maximum laser power had to be carried out to maximize the number of excited molecules. At laser energies higher than 10 µJ pulse -1 we experienced burning of the crystals at all three wavelengths. It was not possible to increase the pulse energy by decreasing the absorption from 0.55 to 0.1, this is taken to indicate that reason for the decomposition of the crystals is not single-photon absorptions but rather multi-photon ablation processes. The laser beam was focused to a diameter of 300 µm whereas the diameter of the X-ray pulse was 50 µm. Based on these dimensions, a pulse energy of 10 µJ pulse -1 and a matter-in-matter concentration of roughly 2 M the number of molecules is estimated to outnumber the number of photons by a factor of 10000:1 -a ratio which is not leaving optimism for the observation of laser-induced changes in the X-ray scattering. Upon subtraction of the CCD diffraction images that result from an isolated X-ray shot and a laser/X-ray sequence we did, however, observe a significant change in the position of the diffraction spots towards larger lattice spacings in the case of the light exposed crystal (scattering at smaller angles, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This difference image remained unchanged from one pulse sequence to the next which means that the new "crystal-state" induced by the laser has a life time of more than one millisecond. The change was shown to be fully reversible by taking another set of diffraction images and noting that they did not differ from the initial ones. We took the millisecond decay to indicate either the existence of a triplet state or simply to reflect a heat-induced coherent motion of the molecules in the crystal. Work is in progress to index the data and ultimately to solve the laser-induced structure.</p><p>Given the low excitation efficiency we also attempted an experiment where the single crystal was substituted for a powder. This enabled the formation of very thin layers and therefore a larger molecule-tophoton ratio. The result of such a powder experiment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; also in this case there is a noticable difference between the diffraction images that are obtained with and without exposure to the laser. Yet again the difference signal persists for milliseconds, thus, no new behaviour is induced by exciting a larger number of molecules -again it would seem that the lattice spacing increases upon exposure to light.</p><p>In addition to DANS we also studied single crystals of antracene:  The aim was to see if this more transparent molecule could be exposed to a higher photon flux. The interesting process in the case of antracene is a dimerisation process which is induced at one wave length and reversed at another. In this case a difference was also observed and the decay of the laser-induced process seems to most faster which might indicate that it is a result of a chemical change. We did not have sufficient time to explore the reaction in the other direction; a process that is induced by another colour.</p><p>In order for time-resolved X-ray studies to be generally applicable a larger excited-molecule to photon ratio is required. It would seem from this study that conventional organic crystals will burn under such conditions. We will attempt to device a grazing-incidence method for single-crystals in order to limit the Xray pulse to probe the uppermost layer of the crystal, i.e., the layer that has been excited.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
