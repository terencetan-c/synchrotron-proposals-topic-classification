<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was conducted at high energy synchrotron beamline ID15A, experimental hutch EH2 (materials engineering) with energy dispersive diffraction (EDD) setup. White beam with an effective energy up to 300 KeV was employed. The beam is sized and shaped in both horizontal and vertical directions by two slits, resulting in a diamond-shaped gauge volume of 0.15×0.15×2.7mm 3 . Samples were measured in a Debye-Scherrer geometry, under transmission mode, with data acquired using two solid state Ge detectors sitting in the vertical and horizontal directions. The diffraction angle and the energy were respectively calibrated using a standard powder and a radioactive source prior to the experiment. A Eulerian cradle was used to orientate the sample into different orientations.</p><p>A selection of ferrite or austenitic steel benchmark specimens with pre-introduced residual stresses and various stress-free reference samples were measured to capture the strain distrubition across key locations at each componenet. Strain were captured at three or more directions in order to facilitate furthre stress calculation. Results will be translated into stress using Hook's Law and be compared with results obtained from other residual stress measurmenet techniques for benchmark purpose.</p><p>Preliminary results suggest that the stress values relies on the accuracy of d0 values, which seem to vary at different locations or directioins. Hence, advanced data analysis employing different d0 values at different locations for stress calculation is essential. The stress distribution determined from the synchrotron technique will be compared with results to be obtained from neutron diffraction, as well as from popular lab techniques including laboratory XRD diffraction, hole drilling and contour method. Currently we are planning on these expeirments and analysing results from different techniques.</p><p>At least one publicatioin is expected to be written based on results obtained from this expeirment, and the outcome will be used to guide both industries and academics in determining the best practices for residual stress measurement.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Wen Cui*, Henry Royce Institute, Department of Materials, University of Manchester Philip J Withers, Henry Royce Institute, Department of Materials, University of Manchester Matthew J Roy, School of Mechanical, Civil and Aerospace Engineering, University of Manchester</figDesc></figure>
