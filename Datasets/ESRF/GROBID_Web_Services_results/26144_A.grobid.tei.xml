<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We selected more than 50 of our best crystals from 4 different projects for data collection on the Dubble beamline at the ESRF, Grenoble. Unfortunately, the beamline was not fully operational. Due to a communication problem within the Dubble organisation we didn't know the real status of the beamline in advance.</p><p>The first crystal we selected for data collection was a TAXI crystal, because inhouse experiments already indicated that the crystals were of diffraction-quality.</p><p>Nevertheless, at Dubble there was no diffraction. It appeared that the beam was not well aligned and centered on the crystal. It took almost the entire day to fix this problem. During this time we collected on another beamline, which was kindly offered to us for half an hour by other users, a few images of the TAXI crystals. They diffracted beyond 2.0 Ã…, assuring us that there was no problem with the crystals and that the transportation of the crystals in the dryshipper didn't affect the quality of the crystals. We were not able to collect even one complete data set on any crystal, because of the problems with the beamline.</p></div>
