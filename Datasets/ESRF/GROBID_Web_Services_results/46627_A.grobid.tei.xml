<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Permeability variation study in collagen-based polymeric capsules</head><p>Laura Pastorino, Svetlana Erokhina, Oleg Konovalov, Paolo Bianchini, Alberto Diaspro, Carmelina Ruggiero Nanomedicine, the application of nanotechnoligies to healthcare, is promising area of nanotechnology which is promising extraordinary and far-reaching implications on human health both from diseases diagnosis and treatment points of view. As relates to diseases treatment, the possibility of developing new nanosystems for efficient drug delivery has attracted great attention. A prerequisite for nanotechnology based delivery systems, in order to be effective, is that the encapsulated drug molecules have to be released at the site of interest. One methods to obtain the specific release is based on the development of systems sensitive to disease associated over-expressed enzymes.</p><p>In this study we report on the fabrication of collagen based containers for drug encapsulation and release by cellular demand by the action of the collagenolytic enzymes matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).Collagen is the major component of the connective tissue and it is involved in many biological functions. Its degradation is at the basis of different pathological processes. The up-regulated expression of MMPs is the causes for such degradation. Collagen based capsules were fabricated by the layer-by-layer technique and characterized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Real-time monitoring of the release kinetics of loaded gold nanoparticles, having different diameters, was done by total reflection X-ray fluorescence.</p><p>Excitation of the fluorescence was performed by grazing incidence X-ray beam of synchrotron radiation.</p><p>This study represents the first attempt in estimating the distribution and dimension of pore size in polyelectrolyte nanoshells. <ref type="bibr">, 1, 192-197 (2011)</ref>.</p></div>
