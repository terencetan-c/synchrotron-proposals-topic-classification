<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to probe the growth of mesocrystals for a better understanding of the mechanism of self-assembling iron oxide nanocubes in colloidal droplets. For that, we have conducted time-resolved SAXS and WAXS measurements in order to probe the self-assembly of oleate capped iron oxide nanocubes. To investigate colloidal droplets and solvent evaporation from nanocube dispersions in real time, we have installed and utilized our acoustic levitator setup. Each time-resolved experiment consisted of inserting ~ 3 µL of a nanocube dispersion with edge lengths of 6.8 nm (C068) and 9.1 nm (C091) into the levitator and collecting SAXS and WAXS data with an exposure time of 0.03 seconds resulting in a time-resolution of 2 seconds per frame, covering a q-range of 0.035 nm -1 &lt; q &lt; 3.74 nm -1 in the small angle and 11.42 nm -1 &lt; q &lt; 50.44 nm -1 in the wide angle regime at a wave length of λ = 1 Å. The drying process of the droplets has been simultaneously recorded with a microscope camera to correlate the onset of self-assembly to the volume fraction of the nanocubes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</p><p>The onset of self-assembly was usually observed after about 20-30 min. As a result, the selfassembly process can be divided into three stages, where first the nanoparticles are well dispersed, followed by aggregation of the nanocubes to large and dense clusters that are forming highly ordered crystalline materials with a simple cubic structure in the crystallization stage (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). After each experiment, the dried beads were transferred to a substrate and probed with scanning electron microscopy where spherical and cubic mesocrystals were observed for C068 and C091 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>), respectively, and both displayed a face-to-face orientation of the nanocubes in a simple cubic lattice, corroborating the SAXS diffraction patterns. Advanced analysis of the collected data is ongoing. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Overview of the experiment, the obtained time-resolved data, and the formed mesocrystals. a) Schematic representation of the working principle of an acoustic levitator, in which the droplet levitates between the pressure nodes of an acoustic wave (top left).
