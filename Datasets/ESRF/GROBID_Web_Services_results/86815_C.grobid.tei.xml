<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Iron nanowires with a diameter of 100 to 200 nm and a length of up to 10 µm were grown by vapor phase deposition on carbon coated tungsten substrates. Individual nanowires were harvested and placed across 2 µm wide Si micro-trenches using micro-manipulators in a scanning electron microscope, thus forming suspended nano-bridges. The nanowires were thoroughly attached at both ends by electron beam induced deposition of Pt using a precursor gas in a SEM. A scanning electron micrograph of such a Fe nanowires is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>. For the intended in situ three-point bending experiments, SFINX was installed at the BM32 beamline. The nanowires were located by measuring the yield of the Fe-K fluorescence. During mechanical loading with the AFM-tip Laue microdiffraction patterns were recorded. The nanowires were deformed by two different methods, either vertical or lateral bending, using the AFM-tip. At predefined loads, the complete profile of the mechanically deformed nanowire was measured by scanning the focused X-ray beam along the nanowire using the KB scanning method. Integrated Laue microdiffraction patterns of the Fe 220 Laue spot for a nanowire at different loading stages is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>  In addition to the intended in situ three-point bending test on Fe nanowires, we performed in situ nanoindentation experiments on individual Au crystals using the same setup as before. The Au crystals were prepared by dewetting a 45 nm thin magnetron sputtered Au film on a sapphire substrate. Laue microdiffraction evidenced that some of the Au crystals contain a twin boundary parallel to the crystalsubstrate interface (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>). In situ nano-indentation revealed that the Au crystals containing a twin boundary exhibit a lower maximal sustainable load before massive plastic deformation occured.</p><p>Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.):</p><p>We successfully performed three-point bending tests on suspended Fe nanowires as well as in-situ nanoindentation on Au crystals. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: a) Schematic of the in situ mechanical and µLaue measurements. b) Approach-retract curve of the AFM. c) Scanning electron micrograph and d) X-ray fluorescence map for a suspended Fe nanowire glued by Pt deposition.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,45.36,487.04,281.04,233.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
