<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context and background</head><p>The aim of the proposal was to study the dynamic compaction of polymeric foams under shock loading produced by laser irradiation in nanosecond regime, using fast X-Ray imaging with ultimate time-resolution (single-bunch imaging). This work was part of an on-going investigation of the response of two polymeric foams to pulsed loads of short duration, including laser driven shocks which allow access to extremely high strain rates (typically 10 7 s -1 ). Potential applications include the use of such foams to protect structures and equipment against crashes or high velocity collisions. Our background consisted in time-resolved velocity measurements which were used to develop a constitutive model at a macroscopic scale, and post-shot analyses of recovered samples which gave some indirect clues on the compaction processes at a mesoscopic scale, namely pore collapse through buckling and breaking of the polymer matrix. The goal of the ID19 experiment was to use to fast X-ray phase contrast imaging with MHz frame rate to get some direct, in-situ picture of these mechanisms, correlate them with the propagation of elastic and compaction waves, and characterize the foam deformation during both loading and unloading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MA-3232 experiment</head><p>After a successful feasibility test [1], a 3 days experiment was performed in December 2016, in collaboration with a German team from HZDR (experiment MI-1266). Participants (see list above) included 4 permanent researchers, 3 PhD students and 3 research engineers. The ID19 staff was deeply involved too, and their efficient help was very much appreciated. Shock loading was generated with a Gaia laser of 5 J-energy and 10 ns-pulse duration kindly provided by Thales. The beam was focused on a 3-4 mm-diameter spot in the surface of a 12 µm-thick aluminum coating through a glass layer or a water drop. Subsequent ablation of a thin absorbing layer produces a plasma. Its expansion toward the laser source drives by reaction a short compressive pulse into the foam sample (about 4×4 mm² with thicknesses ranging from about 1 to 5 mm). Both amplitude and duration of this loading pulse are enhanced by the confining effect of the transparent layer (glass or water).</p><p>Single bunch snapshots were recorded with a fast Shimadzu HPV-X2 camera, in 16 bunch mode (8 µm-pixel size, around 30 keV-photon energy, 170 ns-exposure time, short enough to isolate the X-ray flash, about 100 ps-long, from one bunch of electrons in the storage ring).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Unfortunately, a severe breakdown of the Gaia laser following an electrical problem at startup (initially configured for the US voltage !) strongly limited the output energy, below about 2 J first, then less and less until a complete shutdown after a major water leak inside the laser case. Next we switched to a small ESRF laser borrowed from another beamline (which required major revision of the setup). Despite these efforts, the range of loading pressures was barely beyond the elastic limit of the foams (about 30 MPa for the polyurethane foam), so that exploring the compaction regime as initially planned was not possible.</p><p>Nevertheless, some sequences showing real-time phase contrast imaging of the propagation of compression waves were successfully recorded (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Mean velocities of the elastic and compaction waves were derived. Furthermore, laser shock-compressed samples were recovered and analyzed using X-ray microtomography (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The data were compared to model predictions at both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work</head><p>Two complementary experiments have already been performed at ID19: (i) A similar analysis in phase contrast imaging was carried out under quasi-static compression (experiment MA-3755). It allowed improving our interpretation of the images and determining optimum sample-tocamera distances for best phase contrast or best phase retrieval to get a thickness map. (ii) Two tests were made on the same polyurethane foam under planar impact loading by an aluminum plate accelerated by a gas gun provided by a UK team (Imperial College). The one at higher impact velocity shows very clearly the propagation of the compaction wave front from the impacted surface.</p><p>To pursue this effort and reach our initial goal of full characterization of the foams' dynamic response to laser shock loading (high pressures, higher strain rates and shorter load durations than under plate impact), we have submitted a new proposal on the same subject, based on the use of a TITAN laser in collaboration with HZDR.</p><p>[1] M.
