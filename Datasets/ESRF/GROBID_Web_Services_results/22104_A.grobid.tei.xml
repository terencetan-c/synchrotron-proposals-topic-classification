<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During 1998-99, we concentrated on studying samples in air which had been annealed ex-situ at a range of temperatures. For PET, we observed that crystallisation occurs at the surface for lower annealing temperatures than the bulk of the 1100 Å-thick films. We also found that this surface-induced crystallisation involves strong preferential orientation of the polymer chains with the benzene rings lying parallel to the surface <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>We constructed a vacuum chamber with a hemispherical beryllium dome for probing the ordering process during in-situ annealing. In June 2000, we performed the first surface diffraction study of in-situ processing of polymers and observed clearly the faster kinetics of ordering at the PET surface (report on experiment SI-573). This was followed by a further study of the kinetics of annealing in PET films and at PET/polystyrene buried interface. We also found evidence that reducing the film thickness to 300 Å partially inhibits crystallisation resulting in behaviour which is more similar to the bulk behaviour in the thicker films.</p><p>The aim of this exeriment was to study in detail the effect of layer thickness on surface ordering as the thickness approaches the molecular dimensions. The effect of film thickness on surface ordering has not been investigated previously, but the effect of film thickness on the glass transition temperature T g has been intensively studied in the last five years or so. In polystyrene T g is observed to decrease with decreasing film thickness, whereas for poly(methyl methacrylate) T g can either increase or decrease depending on the strength of interaction with the substrate <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Since the chain mobility increases rapidly around T g , it is reasonable to expect the onset of crystallisation to be closely linked to T g . This experiment as therefore aimed to clarify the effect of film thickness and molecular confinement on crystallisation. A second subsidiary aim was to get high quality data that could be fitted in detail to determine the time constants for development of crystalline peaks for the surface and for the bulk so that the detailed kinetics could be quantified and a separate activation energy for crystallisation of the surface and bulk be deduced. This would be a significant step forward in understanding the influence of the surface on polymer crystallisation.</p><p>PET films of film thicknesses 1100 Å, 300 Å and 180 Å were spin cast from orthochlorophenol solution, the thicknesses being determined by ellipsometry. In-plane diffraction was obtained at an angle of incidence of 0.16° in order to limit the beam penetration to about 60Å, with a wavelength of 1.60 Å in 16bunch mode. Time series of scans were taken during in-situ annealing for different film thicknesses and annealing temperatures. The in-plane scattering is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for thicknesses of 1100 Å and 180 Å. There is no appreciable difference in crystallisation rate discernable between the two samples.</p><p>The experiment was hampered by problems with the heating element of the furnace during the first few days of the experiment. During the later stages of the experiment we found that the thermocouple reading 7°C too low whereas the calibration at the start of the experiment showed the temperature measurement to be accurate to &lt;1°C . This degredation which resulted from minor damage during multiple rewiring of the element rendered the data in the second half of the experiment to be untrustworthy. The thickness dependence of the surface crystallisation is now being pursued with in-situ annealing studies with AFM in Cardiff.</p><p>[1] Surface-induced ordering as a precursor to crystallisation of PET films, M Durrell, J E Macdonald, D Trolley, A Wehrum, P Jukes, R A L Jones, C J Walker and S Brown, Europhysics Letters (2002) in press.</p><p>[2] Character of the glass transition in thin supported films, S Kawana and R A L Jones, Physical Review E63 (2001) 021501 and references therein.
