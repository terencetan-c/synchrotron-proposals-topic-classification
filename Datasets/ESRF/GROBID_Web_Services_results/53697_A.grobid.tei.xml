In frame of the beamtime, these iron complexes were examined. The analysis of the properties and the synthesis of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) attracted a high degree of attention since their discovery in 1980 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> . Magnets are widely used in various applications but information storage is certainly one of the most important uses of magnets. In this field the size for each storage unit is of high importance with regard of storage density. By using single-molecule magnets the storage density could be increased dramatically. A further application of SMMs could be as processing elements in quantum computation <ref type="bibr">[1b]</ref> . Beside manganese, whose d-orbitals are half filled with electrons, which generates a maximal spin (d 5 ), iron (d 6 ) is one of the most prominent elements, which were used for synthesis. Through varaition of the coordinating ligands the electronic structure and spin states can be influenced and with this the energy required for the change between high-and low-spin state. Iron complexes show a very high reactivity and variability to enable the synthesis of potential SMMs. The use of cyclopetadienyl ligands represent an easy way to control the number of other coordinating ligands. The application of very bulky cyclopentadienyl ligands like penta-isopropyle cyclopentdienyl ( 5 Cp) avoids formation of sandwich complexes and allows the realisation of dimeric iron complexes. In a formation with these low valent iron complexes even triple carbon bonds like in tolane (diphenylethine) can be splitted. In the resulting carbon bridged iron dimers the iron centers show high-or low-spin properties dependend on the Scheme: Presumed dimeric structures of the iron precursor complexes. magnetic communication through the bridging atoms. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy the oxidation state of the iron centers and their structural environment could be determined. Since no single crystal structure could be obtained for the shown complexes and due to their paramagnetic nature, no other method was available to clarify the geometric coordination. Here three complexes are shown exemplarily for an ironiron single bond (1), a carbon bridged (2) and a nitrogen bridged (3) species.</p></div>
