<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Comparison of elemental concentration in fluid inclusions hosted in opaque and transparent minerals using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Report</head><p>Aim of the experiment Fluid inclusions are tiny droplets of fluids trapped in minerals. They provide valuable information on geological processes linked to massive fluid transports in the Earth's crust. Mineral deposit of economic interest are built by solubilization, transport and deopsition of specific elements. Scientific studies focused on the understanding of mineral deposits mined for metal resources therefore benefit from the study of fluid inclusions linked with the ore deposition stage. However, most economically-interesting metal-bearing minerals are opaque to visible light and fluid inclusions they host cannot be localised for analysis. Analogues hosted in transparent minerals petrographically linked to the opaque minerals are therefore used. However, little data is available on how similar fluids hosted in transparent and opaque minerals are. Establishing a new method for solving this particular point was the core of this experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>Rock samples of two metal deposits were prepared as chips of quartz and pyrite hosting fluid inclusions. The two metal deposits were a gold-silver low-sulphidation deposit from the Shila district, Peru and the Rosia Poieni porphyry copper deposit, Romania. These samples were doubly polished to a thickness of 100 to 300 microns. Fluid inclusions were localised with either a visible light microscope (in quartz) or an infrared camera (in pyrite) prior to the experiment. Samples were glued on the top of a quartz capillary and held vertically in the beam. For inclusions hosted in quartz, localisation of fluid inclusion was done using the beamline long-working distance video microscope. For inclusions hosted in pyrite, inclusions were localised by performing a radiograph of the sample using the CCD camera installed behind the sample. Once inclusions were localised, a set of CRLs were inserted in the beam to focus it onto the sample. The beam position was measured either using a gold test-object (video microscope) or by direct visualisation (CCD camera). The set-up was easy to switch from the control room from its full field imaging to its microfocus characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and conclusion</head><p>This experiment was dedicated to establishing the experimental method for such analysis of inclusions hosted in opaque minerals. Two energies were tried for X-ray radiograph: 14 and 28 keV. The imaging result in pyrite is by far better at 14 keV. However, this energy do not enable accurate quantification as the incoming beam and fluorescence X-rays do not easily cross the mineral layer. At 28 keV the incoming beam is not strongly absorbed, it decreases the positioning easiness using the full field imaging set-up but increases the number of reachable elements and the accuracy of their quantification. By scanning the beam onto the sample, we were able to image fluid inclusions hosted in pyrite in both types of deposits. The fitted images are provided below. The main informations are that:</p><p>-elements of atomic number lower than Fe can be imaged (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: top, Mn in the porphyry deposit).</p><p>-radiographs allow accurate positioning gof the sample -fluorescence filtering is compulsory as Fe signal is extremely high -low-Z elements (Ca and lighter) cannot be detected due to absorption in matrix and filter</p><p>Quantitative results are still under processing, however, these first results demonstrate that ID18F standard setup allows analysis of fluid inclusions hosted in opaque minerals, thus offering a method for estimating fluid compositions directly in ore minerals.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Jean Cauzid *a,b , Anne-Sylvie André-Mayer *a a G2R, Université Henri Poincaré -CNRS, BP 239, 54506 Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy Cédex b ESRF, 38042, Grenoble, France</figDesc></figure>
