<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background and aim</head><p>Smectites (sheet silicates) occuring in nature contain structural Fe, the chemical form of which influences many physicochemical properties such as cation exchange or oxydo-reduction reactivity. Recent Fe K-edge polarized EXAFS data on smectite self-supporting films exhibited a dichroic behavior and revealed differences in binding environment in two smectites of contrasted chemical compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The angular dependence of the preedge features was complex, a likely consequence of the dominant quadrupole nature of the involved 1s → 3d transition. These pre-edges features were consistent with an octahedral environment, but the crystal field splitting indicated distinct site symmetry. However, accurate analysis of these features was hindered by relatively limited spectral resolution. In order to get further insights into differences in Fe binding environments, we recorded polarized high-resolution XANES spectra and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) planes at the Fe K absorption pre-edge for three smectites prepared as self-supporting films: a hectorite, a montmorillonite and a saponite. In hectorite and saponite, all octahedral sites are filled by Mg (II) cations. However, in hectorite Li (I) or Fe (II,III) substitute for octahedral Mg (II) and in saponite Fe (III) substitues for tetrahedral Si (IV) . In montmorillonite, only 2/3 of the octahedral sites are occupied by Al (III) cations, but Mg (II)  or Fe (II,III) can substitute for octahedral Al (III) .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments and results</head><p>High-resolution polarized XANES and polarized 1s2p RIXS planes at the Fe K absorption pre-edge were recorded at the BM30B beamline using a crystal analyser spectrometer. The incoming X-ray beam was monocromatized using Si(220) crystals, the spectrometer was equipped with five Ge(110) crystals and the reflection of the (440) band was recorded using a SDD detector. Various angles (α) between the electric field of the X-ray beam and the clay layer plane were selected. High-resolution XANES data were corrected for selfabsorption. For all three smectites, XANES exhibited high angular dependences and contained well-defined isosbestic points. Pre-edge features were extracted after subtraction of the baseline with an exponential function (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The pre-edges of hectorite and montmorillonite indicate that Fe is in octahedral coordination, and exhibit clear angular dependences. The ratio of low-energy component (t2g) to high-energy component (eg) differs in both samples, but the variation with α is similar in both samples: it increases from α = 10° to α = 45° and then decreases with increasing α values. This result hints at an electric quadrupole nature of the 1s → 3d pre-edge feature. The pre-edge of the saponite contains only one component and is of higher intensity compared to both other samples, indicating that Fe is in tetrahedral coordination. The monotonic intensity increase with α values hints at an electric dipole character which may arise from metal 4p mixing into 3d orbitals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Polarized high resolution Fe K absorption pre-edge features of the three smectites.</head><p>Further information of the pre-edge features of the montmorillonite was provided by recording 1s2p RIXS planes (intensity of the energy transfer as a function of the incident energy) at α values of 10°, 45° and 80° (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). All planes contain only two peaks originating from the metal 3d orbital split into t2g and eg orbitals. This result excludes the presence of some tetrahedral Fe, because in that case an additional peak would be expected. The angular dependence of the t2g:eg intensity ratio is similar to that in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: it increases from α = 10° to α = 45° and then decreases to α = 80°. Furthermore, the absence of peak tailing informs that Fe is bound to only one type of ligands (O atoms). Analysis of polarized RIXS data for hectorite will inform whether Fe is bound to only O atoms or to O and F atoms (hectorite contains significant amounts of fluorine). Further work will include calculations of density of states and its decomposition into p and d symmetry. The validity of the theoretical model will be tested by comparing with experimental data. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
