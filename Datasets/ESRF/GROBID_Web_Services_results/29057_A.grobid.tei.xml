<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) is a DNA repair enzyme which excises oxidized purines such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) from damaged DNA.</p><p>After having solved the structure of a complex between a mutant Lactococcus lactis Fpg protein and a cFapydG-containing DNA, we focused our attention on the wild-type enzyme. Diffracting crystal were obtained but the hightest resolution obtained in-house was about 2.8Å. The 3 allocated shifts allowed us to test about 25 crystals and to collect 4 datasets. The best dataset was used to solve the structure of our Protein/DNA complex at 1.95Å resolution. The high resolution and the good data quality gave us a clear view of all the residues involved in the damaged base recognition. The missing loop αF-β9 is clearly seen in this structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The Fpg backbone is in yellow, main chains and side chains of indicated Fpg residues are in yellow and pink, respectively. Covalent links are indicated by ball-and-sticks representation. Carbons of DNA are in grey, oxygen atoms in red, nitrogen atoms in blue, phosphate atoms in dark magenta and sulfur atoms in orange. The water molecules (wat) mediating interactions between Fpg residues and the cFapydG functional groups are indicated by red small spheres. Inferred hydrogen bonds are shown as orange dashed lines.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Franck COSTE* (CNRS, CBM Orléans, IR2) Gunasekaran KRISHNASAMY* (CNRS, CBM Orléans, Post-Doc) Bertrand CASTAING (CNRS, CBM Orléans, CR1)</figDesc></figure>
