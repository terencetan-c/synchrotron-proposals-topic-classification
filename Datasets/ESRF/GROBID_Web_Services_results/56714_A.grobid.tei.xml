<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sewage sludge is a secondary resource for the production of P-fertilizers. For landfilling and phosphorus recycling sewage sludge is often mono-incinerated to destroy organic pollutants. However, the resulting sewage sludge ash (SSA) is often polluted with toxic heavy metals and contains phosphorus with a low plant-availability. The limit for mercury in the German fertilizer ordinance is 1 mg/kg. Previous analyses of German SSAs showed mercury mass fractions of 0.1 to 3.6 mg/kg. At BAM two different processes were developed to separate heavy metals and to increase the plant availability of P. Previously, we worked on a thermochemical method using chlorine-donors under oxidizing conditions at approx. 1000°C. Due to the low plant-availability of these recycling P-fertilizers on neutral and alkaline soils a second process was developed. Nowadays, a more promising process was applied where SSA is thermochemically treated with Na 2 SO 4 at 850-1000°C under reducing conditions. Due to the formation of CaNaPO 4 these P-fertilizers have a much higher plant-availability.</p><p>We analyzed several SSAs (1-4) and SSA 1 thermochemically treated with chlorine donors under oxidizing conditions (SSA 1-O) and with Na 2 SO 4 under reducing conditions (SSA 1-R), respectively. With both processes some mercury was separated from the SSA whereby the limit of the German fertilizer ordinance was met. However, mercury compounds are very volatile already at low temperature, only HgSe and HgS are thermal stabile until approx. 1000°C and 600°C, respectively. Thus, all of the mercury should be separated in normal state during thermochemical treatments at 900-1000°C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the Hg L 3 -edge XANES spectra of mercury references, the SSAs and SSA based P-fertilizers. The Hg XANES spectra of SSA 1 and 3 are different to those of SSA 2 and 4. Linear combination fitting (LCF) of SSA 1 determined approx. 42 % CH 3 HgI, 34% HgSO 4 and 24% HgSe. Also other combination with HgS and HgCl 2 are possible, but always with CH 3 HgI as the major component. For SSA 3 a composition of approx. 95-90 % CH 3 HgI and 10-5 % HgSe was determined. Thus, these two SSAs contain mercury adsorbed to carbon, which indicate that the carbon adsorber from the off-gas cleaning after the electric precipitator was disposed together with the SSA.</p><p>In opposite, SSA 2 and 4 have a much stronger pre-peak, which indicates the presence of HgS and/or HgCl 2 . Linear combination fitting of these two SSAs determined approx. 50 % HgS, 25 % HgCl 2 and 25% HgSe. HgS and HgCl 2 should not be thermal stabile at the incineration temperature of 815°C but presumably the contact time was very short whereby they did not decompose or due to HCl and SO 2 gas in the atmosphere these mercury compounds were stabilized. Furthermore, they could be also build in into other stabile minerals like calcium phosphates. Furthermore, in SSA 4 no mercury adsorbed to organic material was found. Additionally we analyzed the carbon absorber of the off-gas cleaning after the electric precepitator of this incineration plant (SSA 4-A), which contains much more mercury than the SSA (approx. 132 mg/kg). LCF determined for SSA 4-A approx. 80% CH 3 HgI and 20% HgSO 4 . Thus, most of the mercury is adsorbed to carbon material of the adsorber. HgSO 4 could have been emerged from interactions of mercury on the adsorber with SO 2 in the offgas.</p><p>During thermochemical treatment of SSA 1 the mercury mass fraction decreased from 2.1 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg with both oxidizing (SSA 1-O) and reducing (SSA 1-R) conditions. LCF determined for SSA 1-O approx. 77% HgS and 23% HgCl 2 , which are similar mercury compounds as detected in SSA 2 and 4. Furthermore, in SSA 1-R, the thermochemically treated SSA 1 under reducing conditions, approx. 82 % HgS and 18% HgSe was detected. However, as mentioned above HgS and HgCl 2 should not be thermally stabile at temperatures of approx. 950-1000°C. Probably the reason is a stabilization of mercury in the SSA matrix. Several processes are in development to stabilize mercury waste in form of ceramics or cements. <ref type="bibr">Cho et al. (J. Hazard. Mater. 278 (2014) 474-482)</ref> showed a process where mercury is stabilized in form of HgS in a matrix of CaNaPO 4 or MgKPO 4 . Possibly, the stabilization of mercury in SSAs proceeds very similar. Thus, during the thermochemical treatments under oxidizing and reducing conditions mercury adsorbed to organic material was separated from the SSA and only some of the more stabile inorganic mercury compounds remain in the SSA. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the Se K-edge XANES spectra of selenium references, the SSAs and SSA based P-fertilizers. The different oxidation states of selenium in the references (HgSe (Se 2+ ), Na 2 SeO 3 (Se 4+ ), Na 2 SeO 4 (Se 6+ )) shows a strong shift of the edge. Thus, the oxidation state of selenium in the SSAs is easily detectable on the position of the edge. LCF determined approx. 15% Se 2+ and 85% Se 4+ for SSA 1 and 3. In opposite, SSA 2 and 4 mainly contain Se 4+ and contain only small amounts on Se 2+ (SSA2: approx. 2%; SSA4: approx. 7%). Thus, a part of the mercury could be bond as HgSe.</p><p>After thermochemical treatment of SSA 1 with chlorine donors (SSA 1-O) all Se 2+ was oxidized to Se 4+ . In opposite, after thermochemical treatment of SSA 1 under reducing conditions (SSA 1-R) 70% of the selenium was determined as Se 2+ and only 30% remain as Se 4+ . Thus, the chemical state of selenium in the SSAs is very sensitive to the thermochemical treatment processes. Summarized, we were able to determine the chemical state of mercury in very diluted SSAs and SSA based P-fertilizers by Hg L 3 -edge XANES spectroscopy at ID26. In some SSAs the mercury loaded carbon adsorber of the off-gas cleaning after the electric precipitator was added to the SSA for waste disposal. These SSAs contain mostly mercury bond to carbon/organic material. The other SSAs mainly contain the inorganic mercury compounds HgS, HgCl 2 and HgSe. During thermochemical treatment mercury bond to carbon material was separated and only some of the inorganic mercury compounds remain in the SSA. Furthermore, Se K-edge XANES spectroscopy supports the theory that HgSe is a part of the inorganic mercury compounds.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Hg L 3 -edge XANES spectra of mercury references, the SSAs and SSA based P-fertilizers</figDesc><graphic coords="2,158.40,75.25,278.30,466.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
