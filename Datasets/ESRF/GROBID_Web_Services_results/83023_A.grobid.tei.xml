<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the current experiment was to measure for the first time the magnetic excitations in RNiO3 thin films and heterostructures by exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of the new ERIXS spectrometer at the ID32 beamline.</p><p>The antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of bulk nickelates is characterized by an unusual q AF =(¼, ¼, ¼) pc ordering vector and a non-collinear spin spiral, which can be tuned by epitaxial strain and spatial confinement. Despite the extensive research that has been performed on RNiO3 so far a direct experimental characterization of the magnetic excitations is still missing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>For this reason, we prepared high-quality thin films of the well-studied nickelates NdNiO 3 (NNO), PrNiO 3 (PNO) and LaNiO 3 (LNO). In addition to the bulk samples, we also brought superlattices with different periodicities comprising RNiO 3 as active layer and RAlO 3 as insulating buffer layers. Thanks to the unprecedented resolving power of the ERIXS spectrometer, we report here the first successful observation of low energy (&lt;100meV) dispersive magnetic excitations in 113 nickelates (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>During our experiment the sample was first aligned to the maximum of the characteristic AF Bragg peak q AF =(¼, ¼, ¼) pc . The incident energy was tuned to the Ni L 3 -edge to maximize sensitivity and intensity of the magnetic signal. We note here, that due to the quite low counting rate at the Ni L 3 -edge each spectrum had to be collected over three hours. The combined resolution was ~50meV, i.e. sufficient to detect the low energy magnons in RNiO3 while allowing for reasonable accumulation time. Among others, we measured the magnetic dispersion along the (111) pc direction (that is the direction of the AF wavevector) in the accessible q-range from q=0.4 Å -1 (far away from q AF : blue in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) to q=0.65 Å - 1 (close to q AF : red in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is necessary to measure the dispersion both well below and above the AF transition temperature in order to decompose the low energy part into elastic, phononic and magnetic contribution. We collected systematic datasets for several samples. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show representative magnetic dispersions for bulk NNO and for a PNO/PAO superlattice, respectively. For all samples, we observed a magnon with an energy dispersion of approx. 30meV and an increased spectral weight close to q AF , which make sense with the expectations for magnetism in RNiO3. Our results will allow for the first time the extraction of exchange coupling parameters which remained to date unknown by combining the experimental findings with a theoretical model currently under development in our group. Our preliminary spin-wave calculations based on a Heisenberg-like Hamiltonian reveals coupling constants of a few meV for the NNO film. The possibility to study the magnetic exchange interactions in 113-nickelates and compare them to cuprates will thus provide new insights into the properties of these materials and on the possibility of achieving artificial superconducting nickelate heterostructures. We also measured RIXS spectra of LNO as a function of dimensionality: in bulk form and as part of a LNO/LAO superlattice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In fact we were able to collect some preliminary spectra on a single crystal, which was successfully grown only very recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the analysis of the low energy part of spectrum of LNO is complicated by the presence of a strong continuum most probably due to charge excitations and to the strong metallicity of LNO, which is presumably damping the magnetic excitations.</p><p>In addition to the low energy magnons discussed above, we got simultaneously systematic data on the high energy charge (dd) excitations for the three prototypical RNiO3, R=Pr, Nd and La (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>). As the experiments were carried out only very recently, our analysis of the dd excitations remains to be finalized: we can anticipate that we were able to observe pronounced changes in the high energy spectrum as a function of rare-earth radius (and consequently Ni-O bonding angle), spatial confinement and epitaxial strain.</p><p>To conclude, we report the first experimental observation of magnetic excitations in 113 nickelates. Our results are a fundamental step to understand the magnetic dynamics in RNiO3 and facilitate for the first time a sound theoretical modelling. Following the results shown above, we are currently preparing a manuscript for publication. other suggestion for Fig. 2 </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Illustration of spectral decomposition and magnetic dispersion for the NNO thin film.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,48.35,86.15,535.35,127.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
