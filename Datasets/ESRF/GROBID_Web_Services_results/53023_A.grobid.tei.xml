<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Structural dynamics in Cobalt Nanoparticles The purpose of the beamtime was to study the solid-solid phase transition of Cobalt Nanoparticles (CoNP's) in liquid solution. By laser-exciting a solution of CoNP's the epsilon particles should transform to a hcp or fcc structure depending on the applied laser intensity (i.e. the particle temperature acchived from laser pumping). After pumping, the hcp/fcc transformed particles was expected to completely relax to hcp structure which is stable at room temperature.</p><p>The experiment was a continuation of HS-3270 (may 2007), where technical difficulties reduced the amount of effective beamtime to less than 24 hrs. at reduced intensity.</p><p>Preparation: Epsilon phase Cobalt Nano Particles where prepared at the Technical Univeristy of Denmark and characterized by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) prior to the beamtime (a standard batch would contain 7 nm epsilon-CoNP's coated by oleic acid). A simulation software tool was created for simulating difference scattering signals from nano particles (NP's) depending on structure, lattice constant and size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p>The laser pump -X-ray probe setup at beamline ID09B was used. The sample solution is cycled through a liquid jet with a sapphire nozzle producing a 300 micron liquid sheet. An array of rotating chopper wheels isolates a single X-ray pulse from the synchrotron and the sample is excited by a femtosecond laser pulse with selected arrival time prior to arrival of the X-ray pulse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup:</head><p>The experiment was performed using a pink 15 keV X-ray beam reflected off the Rumultilayer to get rid of un-desired X-ray arising from e.g. higher harmonics. The sample was excited using a 400 nm laser beam and the diffraction images collected on a FReLoN detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We managed to identify a complete epsilon-&gt;hcp phase transition after 100 ps, and monitored that the hcp phase remained stable on a timescale of at least several hundred nanoseconds. Detailed timeslicing of the sub-100 ps difference signals reveals that the epsilon-hcp transition does not occur in a single, well defined step.</p><p>The difference scattering curve at 200 ps, fitted to the structural changes from thermal expansion of the epsilon particles (at low laser intensity. Better fits showing the phase transition has been acquired.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Outlook:</head><p>Thanks to the software prepared prior to the beamtime, we managed to perform a rough onsite analysis during the experiment, which ensured optimum use of the allocated beamtime.</p><p>We are currrently preparing a manuscript for publication of the results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Morten Christensen*, Kristoffer Haldrup*, Tim Brandt van Driel, Martin Meedom Nielsen*, Kasper Skov Kjaer, Asmus Ougaard Dohn, Tobias Harlang# Simon Oddson Mariager §.
