<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Research into weight saving, high performance material has long been a theme of aerospace engineering. Welding has been identified as an efficient and cost effective alternative to mechanical fastening for fabrication of future aircraft metallic members and components <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, welding unlike mechanical fastening would lead to creation of a single load path and create local &amp; global residual stress field which in turn will have profound influence on fatigue life. Hence it is vital to establish the relation between weld process variable, generation of residual stress and fatigue durability without which the optimum balance between the air-worthiness safety requirement and manufacturing cost reduction will not be achieved. In particular, the behaviour of fatigue cracks under the residual stress profile needs to be understood for reliable prediction of fatigue life necessary for damage tolerant design. In a previous experiment (ME-281) carried out at beamline BM16 the same team measured detailed longitudinal and transverse strain maps on MIG welded Al 2024 amd Al 7150 samples. The same samples were then measured at the pulsed neutron source at ISIS to obtain transverse and normal strain directions. The full residual stress tensor was then calculated using a novel hybrid technique[3]. This work concerns Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welding which is thought to be superior to MIG welding in terms of microstructural performance and fatigue life. However, there has been little previous work on the residual stresses in VPPA welds. So in the present experiment, a VPPA welded coupon sample of Al2024 was measured in as welded and skimmed condition.. The detailed strain maps presented here were then used in conjunction with strain maps of normal and transverse directions measured at ENGIN diffractometer at the ISIS pulsed spallation neutron source to produce the full 3D stress tensor distribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Description:</head><p>Two 11.8mm samples of Al2024-T351 was vertically welded along the rolling direction by VPPA welding process. The keyhole mode of operation results in high heat input and the plates were joined in a single pass. The initial coupon sample produced has a dimension of 400x280x11.8mm, which was then cut into two pieces of 240mm and 120mm length along the welding direction. The sample having dimension of 240x280x11.8mm was used to measure the residual strain. In order to find out the effect of machining another as-welded sample of similar dimension and origin was machined down to 7mm from 11.8mm in steps of 0.5mm from both sides. Stress free reference data were obtained from comb sample of dimension 3x3x11.8mm machined out from the central portion of the weld. Fig1. shows the sample and the stress free reference comb as machined out from the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Details:</head><p>Synchrotron X-rays of energy 45 KeV were used in this experiment which corresponds to a wavelength(λ) of 0.275Å. Texture measurments obtained by EBSD experiment in SEM showed that the Al2024-T351 plate is not characrerised by any strong texture component ( see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) . So the, &lt;311&gt; family of planes were selected for the experiment as there is adequate presence of this family of plane for all the three directions (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and &lt;311&gt; family is the closest representative of the bulk <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>In the as welded plate, 5 through thickness lines were measured in the longitudinal &amp; transverse strain directions ( at +5, +3, 0, -3, -5 mm) whilst in the skimmed sample 7 through thickness lines (at +3,+2,+1,0,-1,-2,-3 mm) were measured in the same two principal strain directions. Stress free reference data were measured in the comb along 3 through thickness lines ( +3, 0, -3) in all the three principal directions. A sin 2 ψ measurement was carried out in the comb in the normal direction to determine the presence of any macro stress in that direction that had not been relieved by the comb production   -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 4.0495 4.0500 4.0505 4.0510 4.0515 4.0520 4.0525 4.0530 4.0535 4.0540 4.0545 Fig 3 Lattice Parameter Position(mm) Longitudinal Transverse Normal -60 -40 -20 0 20 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Fig 4 Stress(MPa) Position(mm) -70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 0.012 0.014 0.016 0.018 0.020 Fig 5 Peak Width Position(mm) Transverse Longitudinal Normal Fig 3.

Peak width analysis of the cube showing the anisotropy in the plastic strain history of the 2024-T351 aluminium plate</p><p>The effect of these intergranular stresses particularly in the transverse direction on the final measured stresses has been removed by the direct calculation of strain from identical spatial locations on the comb sample-that is by using the comb measurments as a d ref rather than a d 0 . The stress measured by sin 2 ψ analysis in the normal direction of the comb has also been used to correct the reference sample variation in all the three directions. The final calculated transverse strain from ESRF shows good agreement with that of measured by pulsed neutron source at ISIS despite of difference in gauge volume, geometry of reflection (Fig 6 ) showing that the effect of these intragranular streses has been removed. The longitudinal and transverse strain data obtained from ESRF is then used along with the normal strain data from ISIS to calculate the full residual stress tensor the Hooke's law. Fig 7 . shows the 3D stress so produced. The longitudinal stress distribution mimics the weld structure in the centre of the weld. The maximum stresses occur in the longitudinal dircetion and in the heat affected zone (HAZ) are characterized by a double peak shape. The maximum stress of 230MPa is also found in the HAZ.</p><p>Aspects of his work are being presented at two international conferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> and is currently being published in appropriate matreials engineering journals</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
