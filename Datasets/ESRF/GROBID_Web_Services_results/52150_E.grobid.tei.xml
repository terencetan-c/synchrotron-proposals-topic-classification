<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This up-dated report corresponds to the data collected at ID23-1 (+ID23-2) during the second round of Mx1541. We brought 160 samples from the different team grouped as CSIC-UGR and UAL. All the samples were tested and the main results are listed below. The experiment at ID23-1 was routinely ok, with some basket-jams in the sample-changer which could be easily solved by following the instructions of our local contact (Giullame Gotthard). At approximately 2:00 A.M., the Pilatus 6M detector had an error, and we could/did not know how to re-initialize it. However, we could continue and finish our experiment the next day in ID23-2 beamline, thanks to the support of both Giullame (who suggested us to ask for it) and to Christoph Mueller-Dieckmann, who gave support to us to start to measure at ID23-2. Crystals from CSIC-UGR (Granada): ii) Structural determination of Pseudomonas chemotactic transducer A, B and C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of results:</head><p>The structure of PctA-Ile and PctA-Tpr have already been solved and deposited at the PDB (ID. 4CU3 and 3D27). Crystallization with other amino acids has fail and therefore we decide to use PctA-Ile and PctA-Tpr crystals to soak other amino acids within the capillaries. Only crystal originally from the adduct PctA-Ile soaked with methionine survive the treatment (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). A full data set was collected at 2.0 Å resolution.</p></div>

We are studying it application as Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals (CLECs), and as part of this study, we want to obtain the crystal structures of the enzymes, to use this information for Structural-based improvement.</p><p>iii-b) Allantoinase (AllBali): As a parallel project production of Reinforced Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals (RCLECs) is also been intended with allantoniase from Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580 allantoinase (AllBali). Allantoinase, a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily, exists in a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and a few animals, such as fishes and amphibians, and catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of allantoin into allantoate by hydrolytic cleavage of the N 1 -C 2 amide bond of the five-member hydantoin ring. AllBali has been cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity in a two-step procedure by metal affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Summary of results: Crystals of both proteins, M7 and Nsar, obtained in different crystallization conditions than tested previously were selected and screened for X-ray diffraction (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). Only one crystal from M7 diffracted X-ray to a resolution limit of 1.7 Å. Structure solution has been attempted by MR with no succeed to date. Crystals of AllBali were obtained by the vapour diffusion method using 0.1 M potassium thiocyanate and 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 as crystallization solution. X-ray diffraction data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) were collected to a resolution of 3.5 Å with a R merge of 29.2% from a crystal belonging to the P12 1 1 space group. Unit-cell parameters are a = 54.93, b = 164.74, c = 106.89 Å and ß=98.49 (article submitted to Acta Cryst. F).  Future perspectives: We will focus or efforts on improving crystals from Nsar and to improved crystal quality of AllBali.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Resume of collected data at ID23-1/2 from PctA crystals.</figDesc><table><row><cell>ID23-1 (28-Jun-2014)</cell></row></table></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>v) Remadiation of radiation damage. We have shortly started a collaborative project together with scientist at XALOC beamline <ref type="bibr">(ALBA, Barcelona, Spain)</ref> to investigate different strategies to remediate the radiation damage during data collection at room temperature. In this project we have selected several model systems i.e. lyszoyme, GST from E. Coli and several target systems i.e. Hyal, to study the effect of treatment, the use of scavangers, etc. Initial test to get space groups and resolution limits under cryo condition were carryied out at ID23 during this slot (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Crystals of GST diffracted to a maxima resolution of 2.0 Å while Hyl crystal reached 1.5 Å and lysozyme co-crystallized with C60 at 1.6 Å. Future perspectives: Data processing is on going and future experiments are been designed.</p><p>In this BAG at the beamline ID23-1/2 the UAL lab collected data from crystals of several proteins.</p><p>i) Protein miss-folding and disease. From this subject we measure two mutants crystals from the third PDZ domain of the PSD95 (PDZ3-PSD95): D332G and D332P. These mutants replace the aspartate residue that is converted to a succinimide residue at the position 332, which is found at the loop between β2-β3 strands. The glycine residue is expected to increase the flexibility of the loop, while the proline reside is expected to show the opposite effect. Crystals from the D332G mutant were obtained in two different crystallization conditions and show different diffraction pattern.</p><p>ii) Proline rich sequences (PRMs) binding domains. We have collected data from several crystals of the TSG101-UEV domain. We have improved the crystal diffraction of the TSG101-UEV/Ebola9-peptide and we have manage to collect for the first time data from the TSG101-UEV/Leukaemia virus-peptide (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Besides we have improved the data of a new crystal form of the TSG101-UEV (previous crystals diffracts at &gt;3 Å resolution). We also brought crystals of the VP40 and TSG101-UEV/VP40 complex but crystals didn't diffract or result in crystal diffraction of the TSG101-UEV alone. We also measured crystals from a complex between the third WW domain of Nedd4 with a high affinity peptide obtained by phage display technique, but these crystals only diffracts at &gt;8 Å and we didn't collect these data.</p><p>Additionally we brought samples of other proteins object of study in our group:</p><p>ii) Ring1B. We have recently published the physico-chemical characterization of the N-terminal segment of this protein ("The isolated N terminus of Ring1B is a well-folded, monomeric fragment with native-like structure" Martínez-Gómez AI et al. Protein Eng Des Sel. 2014 Jan;27(1):1-11. doi: 10.1093/protein/gzt056). We have obtained crystal of this protein. Up to the date, the only structure available of this protein is in complex with its partner protein Bmi1 (B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1) which is critical components of the chromatin modulating PRC1 complex. At this BAG we have collected MAD data from a cobalt derivative. Crystals show serious decay and it is difficult to obtain a full data set. </p></div>			</div>
