<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This up-dated report corresponds to the data collected at BM14U during the second round of Mx1629. We brought 60 samples from the different team grouped as CSIC-UGR and UAL. Among the 60 samples, 15 were not tested due to beam-line operational mal-function.</p><p>Incidents: Since the beginning of data collection a problem of communication arise between MDII and mxCUBE or Spec. Initially the Omega motor did not move properly and the centering routine did not work. Fixed by reconfiguration of mxCUBE and resetting MDII we could continue. Later on this communication issue affected sequentially to the goniometer-front-light (did not stoop), the beam-stop also got suck in its upper position and finally to the mount/un-mount routine being this last one impossible to recover after a second failure. The first failure of the mount/un-mount routine fixed after restarting the hardware (MDII / SC3) and software but a second failure was impossible to recover. We give-up with 15 crystals not tested. This is not an issue since next 25 th February we have allocated time at ID30. Crystals from CSIC-UGR: i) Structural determination of Pseudomonas chemotactic transducer A, B and C: We have produced crystals of PctA, PctB and PctC pre-incubated with several of their natural ligands. Preliminary results from ID14-4 have already been pubished [1] but improved diffraction quality for other protein-ligands complexes are undergoing. We have collected data to high resolution of the</p></div>

Crystal have been grown also at a wide range of conditions and pH. Diferent polymorph were obtained at extreme pH values affecting also crystal quality and resolution limit, i.e. from 3.4 at pH 9.0 to 1.8 Å at pH 4.5 (Mx1541) but we keep trying to fill the gap at several pHs. A resume of the data collected at pH 5.0, 6.0 and 8.0 are shown below (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>Table 2 BM14U Formamidase Protein N. Crys.

We are studying it application as Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals (CLECs), and as part of this study, we want to obtain the crystal structures of the enzymes, to use this information for Structural-based improvement.

We brought to the ESRF of two mutants of the c-Src-SH3 domain and a chimeric protein (c-Src-SH3 domain with the RT loop corresponding to the Abl-SH3 domain). We measure only 15 crystals:</p><p>1. Only one crystal of the Gln128His mutant yields good diffraction. However once solved the structure, the density maps revealed that the mutant correspond to the lysine mutant (Gln128Lys) in its intertwined form, which is already deposited at the PDB (PDB entry 4OMP, 2 Å resolution). We didn't improve the resolution. 2. We collected two data sets of the second mutant, Glu97Thr, and we solved the structure. The structure corresponds to the intertwined dimer of the mutant. Data were collected at 2 Å. The structure is under refinement. 3. The chimeric protein yields long-thin needles. We were able to measure only 5 crystals. We collected two data sets but the quality of the data was very bad and the resolution was higher than 3 Å.</p><p>ii) Choline sulphatase. We brought to the ESRF 10 crystal of this protein in presence of its substrate and alone.</p><p>We have already solve the structure this protein with a sulphate ion bound to a reactive cysteine present in the active site and the active-site mutant His104Ala. We didn't collect data of this protein. The robot didn't work. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>1. Conejero-Muriel, M.,Gavira, J. A. et al., Chem. Commun.
