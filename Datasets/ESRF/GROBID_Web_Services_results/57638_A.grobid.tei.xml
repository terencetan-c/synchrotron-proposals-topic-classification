<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The elemental distribution maps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) indicate that most of the nanoparticles by are accumulated at the periphery of the spheroid and the penetration is of about 10-20 µm in depth that seems to increase with higher exposure concentrations. Nanoparticles accumulation also seems to increase in this manner. It is therefore required to see if penetration changes with different surface functionalisation. An interesting response was seen by copper, overlapping and close to the areas were iron was detected. It is known that proteins containing copper complexes are involved the externalisation of cellular iron and intracellular redox reactions. These responses have to be looked as they might be a form of protective mechanism against the exposed nanoparticles. More insight would be therefore acquired by observing the responses given by other iron nanoparticles of different ionic composition such as Fe3O4 and determine possible causes for this effect.</p><p>A complete and in depth report will be submitted in due time, with the required data analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Zinc, phosphorus, iron and copper elemental distribution maps of tissue sections given by control and spheroid exposed to different concentration of Fe2O3 nanoparticles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Preliminary report being submitted in order to support proposals LS-2459 and LS-2501.</p><p>Experiment LS-2442 successfully determined the distribution of internalised Fe2O3 nanoparticles within HepG2 cellular spheroids. Modifications had to be done to the sample preparation method as various cracks within the tissue sections were being formed during the freeze drying process. A 4% paraformaldehyde fix for 30 minutes at room temperature step was done in between harvesting and snap freezing. This resulted in spheroid sections with significantly less cracks after freeze drying. Flux intensity had to be adjusted as the beam was causing the scarring of the sections. This was adjusted by adding a 500 µm silicon window pre-set at the beamline.</p><p>For the 24 hour exposure period, spheroid sections contained sufficient internalised nanoparticles to give adequate iron fluorescent intensities with exposure times of 200ms and 300ms for exposed and control samples respectively. This allowed the acquisition time for a 100X100 µm section to be acquired in about 34-</p></div>			</div>
