<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this study was to precise the structure of transition metal complexes supported on hybrid material, used as catalysts for different reactions involving olefin valorization as olefin oligomerization and metathesis.</p><p>The different steps of their elaboration had already been followed by chemical analyses and IR, Raman and solid-state NMR or EPR spectroscopies. A XAS study at the active metal K (Zn, Nb) or LIII (Ta, W) edges will help us to precise the evolution of its oxidation state and coordination sphere and consequently strength our knowledge about activity-structure relationship of our systems, for a future rational development of novel tailor-made hybrid material catalysts.</p><p>Up to now three papers have been written, two on the preparation, characterization and use of silica supported tungsten catalysts (ACS Catalysis: one published in 2014 and one accepted) and one on the preparation and characterization of zinc catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (submitted to Organometallics). Extended abstract: The grafting of [WOCl 4 ] on SiO 2-200 under controlled conditions, leading to sample 1 200 , was studied using experimental and theoretical approach. Combination of spectroscopic evidence backed up by DFT calculations demonstrated that the grafting results in bipodal tungsten oxo bischloride surface species [(≡SiO) 2 WOCl 2 ] (1a) as the major component, along with minor monopodal tungsten oxo trischloride centers [(≡SiO)WOCl 3 ] (1b). 17 O NMR demonstrated that both these centers adopt a square pyramidal configuration, with the oxo ligand in apical position.</p><p>Further treatment with SnMe 4 , leading to sample 2 200 , results in Cl/Me exchange within the surface species, as shown mainly by EXAFS and 1 H and 13 C MAS NMR. This material is active in alkene metathesis, achieving efficient conversion of the challenging isobutene substrate. Importantly, this catalyst shows high stability and selectivity towards ethylene and 2,3dimethyl-2-butene. The parameters obtained from the fit of the k 3 .χ(k) EXAFS signal are consistent with the following coordination sphere around W (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Table 1): one oxygen atom at 1.68(1) Å, assigned to an oxo ligand, a bit less than two oxygen atoms (1.7 ± 0.3 O) at 1.87(1) Å, corresponding to -bonded siloxy ligands and a bit more than two chloride back-scatterers (2.3 ± 0.3 Cl) at 2.30(1) Å. This is consistent with the bond distances found in [OWCl 2 (OAr) 2 ], type of molecular complexes where the W=O (1.638 -1.715 Å), W-O (1.831 -1.978 Å) and W-Cl (2.309 -2.383 Å) bond lengths are in the same range. Similar W-Cl bond distances have been also observed for crystalline WOCl 4 (2.28 Å for W-Cl; 1.8 Å for W=O) or for molecular complexes where WOCl 4 is bonded to azoxybenzene (2.279 to 2.308 Å for W-Cl; 1.651 to 1.687 Å for W=O) or to a ketone, CF 3 C(O)CH=CHNHC 6 H 5 Br (2.259 to 2.308 Å for W-Cl; 1.664 Å for W=O). Similar parameters were obtained when fitting the k 2 .χ(k) spectrum. The results thus agree with a major bis-siloxy structure, [(≡SiO) 2 WOCl 2 ], 1a (70-80%), along with a mono-siloxy species, 1b (20-30%). This result was supported by NMR of the sample 1* 200 ([WO*Cl 4 ] on SiO 2-200 ), selectively enriched on the oxo moiety by 17 O NMR.  The errors generated by the EXAFS fitting program "RoundMidnight" are indicated in parentheses. a Δk: [2.1-18.0 Å -1 ] -ΔR: [0.7-2.4 Å]; S0 2 = 0.94; ΔE0 = 9.5 ± 2.0 eV (the same for all shells); Fit residue: ρ = 4.1 %; Quality factor: ) 2 / = 3.85, with  = 11 / 19. b Shell constrained to the parameter above.</p><p>EXAFS characterization of sample 1 200 : Further characterization of 2 200 was carried out by EXAFS. Clearly, when compared to 1 200 , the W-Cl scattering pathway decreases after alkylation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">9</ref>). The parameters extracted from the fit of the k 3 .χ(k) EXAFS spectrum (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) are consistent with one oxo ligand at 1.70(1) Å, ca. two oxygen at 1.88(1) Å and three carbon atoms at 2.12(2) Å, respectively assigned to siloxide and methyl ligands, consistently with the bond distances found in (Silox)</p><p>2 (n-Bu) 2 WO (1.705(2) Å for W=O; 1.876 to 1.882 Å for W-O; 2.098 to 2.154 Å for W-C) or in (O-ArCH 2 N(Me)CH 2 Ar-O)(Me) 2 WO (1.694-1.706 Å for W=O; 1.887 to 1.919 Å for W-O; 2.170 to 2.191 Å for W-C). The W-C distance obtained by EXAFS seems a bit short compared to the last example, however W(O)-Me distances as short as 2.052 Å have already been reported. Similar parameters were obtained when fitting the k 2 .χ(k) spectrum. Furthermore, the fit was improved when considering a further layer of Cl atom back-scatterers at 2.37(2) Å (only ca. 0.3 such neighbours compared to 2.3 in the starting material), suggesting that the Cl/Me exchange is maybe not fully complete upon reaction with SnMe 4 , and a layer of oxygen back-scatterer at 2.91(4) Å which would be due to oxygen of surface siloxanes of silica. The results obtained are thus in good agreement with a Cl/Me exchange after the reaction of 1 200 with SnMe 4 leading mainly to [(≡SiO) 2 WOMe 2 ] (2a), with most probably [(≡SiO)WOMe 2 Cl] (2b) as minor species (ca. 20-30%). This result is in accordance with 13 C CP NMR features that indicate the presence of minor W-Me containing species.  The errors generated by the EXAFS fitting program "RoundMidnight" are indicated in parentheses. a Δk: [2.2 -18.0 Å -1 ] -ΔR: [0.7-2.9 Å] ([0.7-2.4 Å], when considering only the first coordination sphere without Cl); S0 2 = 0.94; ΔE0 = 8.7 ± 2.0 eV (the same for all shells); Fit residue: ρ = 10.5 %; Quality factor: ) 2 / = 3.81, with  = 11 / 24 ([() 2 / = 4.99 with  = 11 / 19, considering only three backscatterers, oxo, -O and -C in the first coordination sphere of W). b Shell constrained to the parameters above and below.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>First</head><figDesc>paper: Well-defined supported mononuclear tungsten oxo species as olefin metathesis pre-catalysts.
