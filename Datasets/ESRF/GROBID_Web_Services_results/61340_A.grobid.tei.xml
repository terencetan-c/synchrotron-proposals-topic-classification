<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the allotted beam time reported herein, High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD) EXAFS of several catalytic states of soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). A previous EXAFS study of the key sMMO Q intermediate assigned an extremely short 2.46 Å Fe-Fe distance do the diiron active site. This distance has not been reproduced synthetically or computationally. The controversially short Fe-Fe distance has not been revisited in nearly 20 years, and has long been suspected to be metallic iron (α-Fe) as the published FT EXAFS spectrum has features that strongly resemble that of α-Fe.</p><p>Rapid-freeze quenched samples of sMMO are comprised of three states: the diiron(II) reduced state, the diiron(III) oxidized state and the diiron(IV) Q intermediate of interest, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Quantification of each state within the trapped samples was performed prior to Xray analysis by Mössbauer spectroscopy and samples contained an average of 30% Q. We initially set out to employ iron Kβ detected EXAFS for spin-state selectivity to inherit shifts in the Kβ mainline energies. During this beamtime, the Kβ mainline emissions of sMMO red, ox, and Q were collected for the first time. Both of the sMMO red and ox mainlines are fairly typically for Fe(II) and Fe(III) high-spin centers. It is known from Mössbauer spectroscopic studies that Q is an antiferromagnetically coupled diiron(IV) center, however, the local spin states (either S loc = 1 or 2) have not been conclusively determined. The Kβ mainline of Q remarkably resembles the emission spectrum of a S = 1, Fe(IV) oxo model complex previously studied, particillary in the intensity of the Kβ` feature (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), an indication of intermediate spin.</p><p>For the case of sMMO, it was unfortunately observed that the shifts in the Kβ emission features were less than desirable and significantly less than the separation of spin-states exhibits in 'proof of principle' EXAFS experiments. Due to the decreased fluorescent count at the Kβ emission energy, we opted to forgo spin-state selectivity and ultilize HERFD detection of the EXAFS at the Kα emission energy. One frequently overlooked advantage of performing Kα HERFD XAS with a Johann spectrometer is high spatial resolution of the sample. Background floursecent events arising from metal within the experimental setup (i.e. cryostat walls, windows, shutters, etc) are eliminated as the fluorescence from these points in space will hit the analyzer crystals of the spectrometer at a different angle than fluorescence from the same and therefore will not be reflected and detected. Because of the HERFD detection employed here, the EXAFS data collected is thought to free of containment fluorescence.</p><p>XANES spectra of the various sMMO samples are consistent with previous findings, including the high-energy edge for the diiron(IV) Q intermediate and increased pre-edge area (See ESRF CH-4570, 4417 and 3908). Immediate examination of the Kα HERFD EXAFS of sMMO Q exhibits no 2.46 Å Fe-Fe scatterer. Fitting of sMMO red and ox based on their crystallographic structures is possible. The diiron distance fit in each is consistent with the crystal structures, and it FT EXAFS is fit more than satisfactory with only first shell O/N scatterers, the Fe-Fe scattering path and a necessary group second shell carbon scatterers (See Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The EXAFS sample of Q is modeled as mixture of three diiron species, utilizing the scattering paths and fits for sMMO red and ox as standards within the fit at their predetermined amplitude. The component of the EXAFS corresponding to Q is best fit with a long diiron distance (3.4 Å), indicative of an open core structure. This finding reverses the previous core model proposed and corrects a potentially flawed EXAFS measurement.
