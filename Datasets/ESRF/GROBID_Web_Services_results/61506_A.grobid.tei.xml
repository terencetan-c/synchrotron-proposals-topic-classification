<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results:</head><p>The initial aim of the experiments was to investigate Se high temperature partitioning between vapor and silicate melts to model chalcogenes (S,Se,Te) magmatic degassing. Unfortunately, the experiments required a new autoclave for in situ XAS measurements up to 1300 °C and 300 MPa that was not delivered in time for the experiments. Consequently, I decided to resume previous work that aims at providing new constraints on the role of hydrothermal fluids in the formation of rare metals mineralization in large igenous provinces (e.g., Bayan Obo, ChinaThor Lake, Canada) by studying the HFSE and REE high temperature aqueous chemistry using in situ XAS. This study started in October 2014 and has seen my collaborators and me investigating the aqueous solubility and speciation of Sm, Eu, Gd, Er and Yb up to 500 °C and 80 MPa over 5x18 shifts of beamtime on the BM-30B beamline (Experimental Reports 30-02-1089; 30-02-1096; 30-02-1102). A full understanding of the compositional controls on the hydrothermal mobilization and concentration of REE in rare metals ore deposits yet needed to study the role of fluid's pH and complexation to S in the development of light (La to Eu) to heavy (Gd to Lu) REE fractionation reported in some mineralizing environments. Therefore, we have now determined the solubility and speciation of Nd in fluids containing Cl, carbonates or sulfates and of different pH (&lt;1 to ~12) from 200 to 500 °C at 80 MPa.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and conclusions of the study:</head><p>The experiments were conducted from 200 to 500 °C at 80 MPa around the Nd L III -edge (6.208 keV) in the high temperature autoclave dedicated to in situ X-Ray absorption spectroscopy of hydrothermal fluids available on the BM30-B beamline <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. This is the lowest energy ever reached for in situ XAS measurements in the autoclave on BM-30B. The XAS spectra collected in fluorescence modes were used to determine both the speciation and the solubility of Nd in the high temperature fluids. Generally, we use the XAS spectra collected in transmission to determine the concentration of elements in the solution, ie., the solubility of REE [2], but complete absorption of the X-ray beam by the aqueous solutions prevented their collection. Instead, the fluorescence signal was calibrated with solutions of 200, 1000 and 2000 ppm of Nd in H 2 O and 0.5m HCl for solubility measurements. Nd oxides and phosphates solubility and speciation was investigated over different  In Cl-rich fluids, the experimental results suggest that Nd oxides and phosphates are more soluble than Gd, Er or Yb compounds over similar P-T-X range. The experiments further show that Nd forms chloride complexes with 2-3 Cl atoms from 200 °C onwards in solutions with 0.05 to 0.75m HCl, confirming the higher stability of LREE-over HREE-Cl complexes in high-temperature fludis (same for Sm, as seen in Experiemental Report 30-02-1102). These complexes are expected to account for the more efficient mobilization of LREE by Cl-rich fluids in magmatic-hydrothermal environments. The same appears true for H 2 SO 4 -NaCl solution, where the solubility of Nd significantly exceeds that of Yb, at least up to 400 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.). Besides, comparison of the EXAFS oscillations for these compositions suggest a significant change of speciation upon temeprature increase for Nd, which is not observe for Yb. EXAFS analysis is currently underway, but we expect this different complex to involve sulfur atoms. Hence, these observations could be the first experimental ones supporting thermodynamic calculations that suggested an increased stability of sulfate over chloride complexes with increasing temperature <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Finally, as for the other REEs, Nd solubility is extremely low (at least &lt; 20-50 ppm according to our calibration) in phosphoric acid, pure H 2 O and alkaline solutions, which confirms the significant role of pH increase and P leaching in the rare earth ore precipitation <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>The BM30-B beamline provides a unique environment for the in situ study of aqueous fluids at the P-T relevant to the hydrothermal precipitation of economic minerals/metals in shallow crustal environments <ref type="bibr">(200 &lt; T &lt; 600 °C and P &lt; 200 MPa)</ref>. The present study confirms and complements previous measurements at the Sm, Eu, Gd, Er and Yb L III -edges. In particular, the EXAFS analysis demonstrated that each REE might form different complexes in the same fluid compositions, which confirms the critical inputs of the in situ approach to provide new insights on the REE aqueous chemistry and the potential effect of fluid composition on the formation of rare metals ore deposits. In the next months, the entire dataset on Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Er and Yb will be summarized in two manuscripts: one describing in detail REE-Cl complexation in high-temperature fluids and the second one focusing on the compositional controls on the solubility of the different rare earth. Over-all, this dataset is expected to facilitate future modeling of REEs aqueous transport and deposition in mineralizing environments.</p></div>
