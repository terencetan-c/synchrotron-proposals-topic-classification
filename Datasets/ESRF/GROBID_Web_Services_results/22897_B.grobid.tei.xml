<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Normal Thomson scattering experiments have been undertaken on GdB 6 below the ordering temperature T N = 15 K, in order to study the atomic displacement waves associated with the magnetic order. Two successive spontaneous antiferromagnetic phases exist, separated by a transition at T = 8 K and the measurements have been performed in the two phases, at 1.8 K and 12 K. As the magnetic propagation vector k belongs to the &lt;1/4, 1/4, 1/2&gt; star, satellite reflections are expected at the following high symmetry points in the first Brillouin zone:</p><p>(1/2, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/4, 1/4, 0), (1/4, 1/4, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Preliminary X-ray diffraction measurements on that compound [1] had shown that satellites of the form (h/2, k, l) and (h/2, k/2, l) exist in the low temperature phase, and that only the satellites of type (h/2, k, l) remain above 8 K.</p><p>The single crystal used for this experiment was cut with a surface perpendicular to a [110] axis and oriented with this twofold direction parallel to the ϕ axis of the goniometer, so that (h, h, 0) reflections are specular. It was mounted into a cryostat in order to reach the low temperatures. At T = 1.8 K, satellites associated with propagation vectors (1/2, 0, 0) and (1/2, 1/2, 0) have been observed, confirming the previous results. Satellites associated with propagation (1/4, 1/4, 1/2) could also be measured, with an intensity being one order of magnitude smaller. No other satellite could be observed. At T = 12 K, satellites of type (1/2, 0, 0) have increased, satellites of type (1/2, 1/2, 0) have decreased and satellites of type (1/4, 1/4, 1/2) have disappeared. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the ω scans performed on the (4, 4, -1/2), (9/2, 9/2, 0) and (17/4, 17/4, -1/2) reflections at the two temperatures 8 K and 12 K. The thermal variation of the square root of their normalized intensity is represented in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Up to 10 K, they present exactly the same thermal dependence, indicating that they are related to the same physical mechanism. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> for the (h/2, h/2, 0) type reflections, the variation of the satellite intensities with the scattering vector Q is quite specific of an atomic displacement wave.</p><p>As pointed out by T. Kasuya [2], such a displacement may originate from an "exchange-pair Jahn-Teller effect ". The absence of the (h/4, h/4, l) reflections is in agreement with what can be predicted on the hypothesis of isotropic exchange. On the same basis the displacement waves are straightforwardly related to the magnetic structure. Therefore the analysis of the data, underway, gives means for an indirect determination of the actual magnetic structure.</p><p>[1] R.M. Galéra, D.P. Osterman, J.D. Axe, S. Kunii and T. Kasuya, J.
