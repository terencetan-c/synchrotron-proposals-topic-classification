<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the most studied targets for HCV therapy is the serine proteinase activity of NS3 protein of HCV. A macromolecular inhibitor of the Nterminal serine protease of the HCV NS3 protein has been affinity selected from a library constructed by inserting randomized oligonucleotides in the region corresponding to the CDR3 of prototype camelized human variable domain antibody fragment (see F. <ref type="bibr">Martin et al. Protein Engineering (1997)</ref> 10, 607-614 for details). This inhibitor has a Ki of 150nM. In analytical gel filtration experiments the molecule appears to behave as a dimer, although it is unknown whether it is functionally active as a dimer or a monomer. The macromolecular inhibitor cV H E2 has been purified and crystallized and Xray data were collected at ESRF (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The 'camelised' cVHE2 domain structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Lama Glama Heavy chain variable domain, against alpha-subunit of Human chorionic Gonadotropin (PDB entry code, 1HCV), which shares a sequence identity of 69%. The crystal structure was solved and refined at 1.8 Å (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).The protein is a dimer in the crystal, which was not yet observed in human or mouse heavy variable domains. The overall shape of the molecule is displayed as a ribbon diagram of the backbone in fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The architecture of the cVHE2 as anticipated fits the well-known variable domain immunoglobulin fold with a four-stranded ? β-sheet facing a five-stranded ? β -sheet. <ref type="bibr">(Chothia, et al, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Padlan et al 1994)</ref>. Fig. 2, Ribbon diagram of cVHE2 dimer. β-strands are in blue and sky-blue, loops are in blue. Colours are not related to structure features.</p><p>Interestingly the major change noted in the structure is the dimeric crystal packing arrangement in which the two homodimers are packed head to tail. This association is unlike the arrangement of VL and VH in a FV fragment. Contrary to a FV, none of the three CDRs of these two domain participates in the interdomain contacts in the homodimer structure. Moreover this association places the two VH domains in a relative spatial arrangement corresponding to a quasi heterodimeric FV structure where one of the two domains has been rotated 180° in respect to the other. The β-strand structure of the two homodimers can be superimposed with a r.m.s. of 0.2 Å. A possible inhibitor binding mechanism for the cVHE2 to the NS3 active site is explained (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, Cα model showing the hypothetical binding of the cVHE2 to the NS3 protease active site cVHE2 monomer is drawn in blue and NS3 protease in magenta, the CDR3 is shown in ball and stick as the inhibitor bound to the protease.</p><p>The more favorable interaction between the antigen and NS3 seems to happen at the top of the NS3 active site. It is not possible to position the CDR3 directly in the active site pocket of NS3, in the same binding position of the inhibitor, because this will cause an intermolecular clash between the cVHE2 and NS3, suggesting the existence of only one way for interfering with the catalytic activity. Under this hypothesis the CDR3 would determine a sterical hindrance, not allowng in this way a simultaneous substrate and inhibitor entrance, so explaining what previously reported by us about the competitive nature of the cVHE2 (Martin et al, 1997).</p></div>
