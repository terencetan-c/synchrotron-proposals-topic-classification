<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Spatially resolved structure-function correlation in organic electronic liquid-crystal devices </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have performed a detailed investigation of the local structure and phase behaviour of organic semiconducting liquid crystals as a function of temperature, whilst simultaneously measuring electrical properties. Liquid crystal (LC) cells consisting of two glass plates with indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, separated by a 5 µm spacer, were inflitrated with LC molecules. These LC cells were mounted in a Linkam THMS600 hotstage for temperature control. Local structural information was obtained by performing raster scanning µ-focus X-ray diffraction (µXRD) in transmission mode, using a beam of size 2 × 2 µm 2 and energy of 13.8 keV. Data were collected with an EIGER 4M detector. The LC cells were heated and cooled and at each temperature interval, a 2D scanning diffraction map was collected, whereby µXRD patterns were collected over a 100 µm 2 area with 2 µm 2 resolution. After the scan was performed, the electrical properties were characterised using a Kiethley 2400 source meter in two modes. First, time-dependent current measurements were recorded for a fixed applied voltage of 1.5 V and second, the current was measured as a function of voltage over a range of 0 to 1.5 V.</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to study the phase behabiour and spatial distribution of LC domains, defects and grain boudaries as a function of sample temperature and to correlate this information with the electronic behaviour of the LC cells. The µ-XRD setup at ID13 allowed us to extract such structural information in exquisit detail. A key feature of the observed diffraction patterns was that for defect domains of homogenous alignment (i.e. long axis of the molecule oriented parallel to the LC cell), the inter-layer (100) reflection (d ~3 nm) presented in the small angle region (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). In the bulk of the homeotropically aligned LC matrix (i.e. long axis of the molecule oriented normal to the LC cell) the (100) reflection is absent (cf Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). This allowed us to map out the locations and orientations of domains in real space as well as determine the liquid crystalline phase structure as a function of temperature. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> shows an optical microscopy image of the LC material at room temperature. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref> shows an orinetation map of this same region (100 × 100 µm 2 , 2 µm 2 resolution, 24 ms exposure per point). Black pixels represent homeotropically aligned regions, where the (100) reflection is not present. Coloured pixels represent regions of homoegenously aligned defect domains, whereby the colour corresponds to the orientation angle of the molecular long-axis. This map was generated by fitting the azimuthal angle of the (100) refelction in each diffraction pattern (software: B. Weinhausen, ID13, ESRF). Such diffraction orientation mapping allowed us to study the domain behaviour as a function of sample temperature (cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Furthermore, by taking an average of all the diffraction patterns collected in one spatial map, 1D line profiles could be extracted and used to identify the LC phase (crystalline highly ordered smectic liquid crystalline isotropic upon heating). The data presented in the report represents the initial stages of analysis of temperature-dependent structural behaviour of these LC systems. We successfully measured the electrical properties of these LC devices in situ (data not shown). The ID13 microbeam scanning diffraction setup permitted the acquisition of data with unprecentented spatial (as well as reciprocal spacial) resolution, and in combination with our electrical characterisation will give a truly fundamental insight into the structural dependence of charge-transport processes in LC devices. The data are currently being prepare for publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Thomas DANE* (ESRF, 71 avenue des Martyrs, CS 40220 FR -38043 GRENOBLE Cedex 9) Patrice RANNOU* (CEA Grenoble -INAC SPRAM/LEMOH, 17 rue des Martyrs, FR -38054 GRENOBLE Cedex 09) Charl FAUL (University of Bristol, School of Chemistry, Cantock's Close Cotham, Avon, GB -BS8 1TS BRISTOL) Wuge BRISCOE (University of Bristol, School of Chemistry Cantock's Close, Cotham Avon, GB -BS8 1TS BRISTOL)</figDesc></figure>
