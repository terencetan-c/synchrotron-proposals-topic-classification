<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High pressure studies of magnetism</head><p>We have been studying during the two last years, Pt based system under pressure by XMCD at ESRF on the ID24 beam-line. The first year we focus on the Pt3Cr system at the Pt L 23 edges.</p><p>Here we recall the main results and arguments of the previous experimental report. The Pt 3 Cr system has been chosen as model system. In fact, recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> reports on the magnetism of Pt in this alloy which is very unusual; the L 3 and L 2 XMCD signals have the same sign, meaning a dominant orbital contribution. Pt 3 Cr is therefore a good candidate to investigate volume-dependent magnetism of Pt. In addition the Curie temperature is 450 K, well above the room temperature. Moreover, only the crystallographically ordered phase carries a magnetic moment. A great pressure sensitivity of the magnetic moment is therefore expected because changes in crystallographic phase or order can be induced. Both L 3 and L 2 edges XMCD have been measured under pressure, thereby probing the 5d Pt magnetic moment. X-ray diffraction under pressure doesn't show any change in the crystallographic structure of Pt 3 Cr, which remains cubic. The XMCD signals under pressure at the Pt L 3 and L 2 edges (figure1) show a slow decrease between 0 and 3.5 GPa followed by a very abrupt increase between 3.5 and 5.0 GPa. The first decrease reflects an attenuation of the magnetic moment carried by the Pt 5d states along the x-ray propagation axis. It could originate from a decrease of the Cr magnetic moment, inducing a smaller Pt magnetic moment, or from a progressive change of the magnetic order resulting in a smaller ferromagnetic component.</p><p>The following increase of the platinum 5d band magnetic moment is induced by the increasing hybridization with the 3d Cr band. This second effect is probably already present between 0 and 3.5 GPa but is hidden by the decrease of the total projected moment. After 5 GPa there is a rapid attenuation of the signal, down to zero which could be due to the loss of the crystallographic order in the sample.</p><p>The main result of this study is the constant branching ratio along the pressure domain. There is no L/S ratio variation between 0 and 5 GPa which is rather surprising considering the strong magnetic moment dependence from crystallographic order. The disappearance of the magnetic moment with the loss of crystallographic order shows the great sensitivity of the orbital and spin moment to the local order. At the same time, their ratio remains insensitive to the reduction of interatomic distance between 0 and 5 GPa (which is typically ~ 0.7%).</p><p>The loss of crystallographic order after 5 GPa must be studied in more detail by x-ray diffraction. It could be sample preparation dependent and to be overcome in the next future. This could allow the measurement of XMCD signals at higher pressures up to the orbital moment quenching.</p><p>During the last year we take full benefit of our allowed beam time on ID24 thanks to the great recent improvement of the beam line. First we confirm the results of the previous year on Pt 3 Cr at both edges. We start the study of other compounds i.e. Pt 3 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Pt 3 Cr 0.75 Mn 0.25 . figure2. The L 3 XMCD signal of Pt 3 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 is very interesting because we can separate the Cr and Mn contribution to the magnetic polarization of the 5d band of Pt. The positive part is due to Cr and the negative one to Mn. The same append for Pt 3 Cr 0.75 Mn 0.25 with a ratio proportional to the stoichiometry.</p><p>On figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> we report the absolute value of the amplitude of the Cr and Mn part of the XMCD signal in Pt 3 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 . Both show the same pressure behavior as describe for Pt 3 Cr, i.e. an increase following by a large decrease. Nevertheless the signal doesn't go down to zero as for Pt 3 Cr. This could be due to the presence of Mn, (the magnetic moment in Pt 3 Mn is know to not being sensitive to the crystallographic order), inducing a magnetic moment on both Pt and Cr in the high pressure regime in Pt 3 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 . We observe a larger decrease for the Cr than for the Mn contribution of the Pt signal witch agree with a smaller sensitivity to the crystallographic order of the Mn magnetic moment than the Cr one.</p><p>We measure also the pressure variation at the L 2 edge of Pt in Pt 3 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 . We obtain of course on positive peak varying with pressure in the same manner as seen in figure1 for Pt 3 Cr. A small decrease of the signal between 0 and 3.5 GPa, following by a large increase between 3.5 and 5 Gpa and then a large decrease after 5 GPa. Here again the signal is largely reduced but don't go to zero at high pressure like in for the L 3 edge.</p><p>0 5 10 15 20 0,02 0,04 0,06 0,08 0,10 0,12 Cr Mn XMCD intensity pressure GPa</p><p>During the last day of the allowed beam time we focus on the main unresolved experimental problem of our study, the decrease of the signal after 5 GPa. We suspect a loose of perfect hydrostaticity after 5GPa giving non-physical decrease of the XMCD signal. We try to change our pressure-transmitting medium from silicon oil to an ethanol/methanol mixture, witch is know to be more hydrostatic than silicon oil above 5 GPa.</p><p>Unfortunately our gasket of tantalum opened during the pressure increase just at 5 GPa. The very short remaining beam time prevent to prepare an other sample for an second experiment, so we try again with the same sample and a new gasket with a smaller hole, witch give a better chance to not open. The result vas very surprising, first we see that the first increase of XMCD is fully reversible and reproducible. Secondly we didn't observe any decrease of the XMCD after 5 GPa, but a continuous soft increase up to 20 GPa, were the gasket opened again. We can't conclude today if the change of XMCD pressure behavior is due to the change of pressure-transmitting medium or to the fact that the sample has already seen a first increase of pressure. We already observe two years ago the same change in the XMCD behavior at the L 3 edge of Pt in Pt 3 Cr in a second pressure increase on the same sample.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure1:</head><figDesc>Figure1: Integral of Pt L 3 and L 2 XMCD signals on Pt 3 Cr as a function of pressure.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We hope to complete the large set of reliable results obtained between 0 and 5 GPa by new measurements above 5 GPa with a new pressure method. We propose to focus on the Pt 3 Cr 0.5 Mn 0.5 at the L 23 edges. We hope to follow up to 25 GPa the spin and orbital magnetic moment behavior of Pt induced respectively by Mn and Cr. The pressure technique will be based on alcohol-mixture and liquid argon as pressure transmitting medium and rhenium gasket.</p></div>
