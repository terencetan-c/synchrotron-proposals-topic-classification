<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>PDI8-CN2 films were prepared in in-house developed UHV chamber equipped Organic Molecular Beam Deposition (OMBD), designed to be compatible with for in situ X-ray Diffraction measurements. The chamber was installed on the 6-circle diffractometer at ID10B beamline. The wavelength was fixed at 0.96433 Å. PDI-8CN 2 was grown on 270 Å thick thermal SiO 2 /Si substrate up to a thickness of 180 Å at different growth rates (from 0.1 Å/min to 10 Å/min) and at two different substrate temperatures (25°C and 120°C). Before a new PDI8-CN2 film deposition, the substrate was cleaned through annealing at 600°C, i.e. well above sublimation temperature for this molecule, for at least 10 min in order to desorb all the organic material. The recovery of XRR for the bare substrate ensured for surface cleanliness and provided a reference for the bare substrate. XRR curves have been recorded during the PDI8-CN2 deposition and the acquisition time of ~ 2 min per reflectivity scan was chosen to enable the study of the relatively slow growth process. In this way XRR as a function of time as well as of q during PDI8-CN2 growth has been collected. On the other hand for faster growth (from 2 up to 20 Ǻ/min) the scattered intensity has been recorded at a singe q point, i.e the 1/2q B , with a resolution time of ~1s . The use of a linear position sensitive detector PSD allowed us to recorded, simultaneously, during the deposition, the specular and the off specular scattered intensities. The XRR data reported in the following have been obtained after subtraction of the diffuse scattering (offspecular) to the specular intensities.</p><p>To study the temperature dependent growth dynamics and to establish the growth mode, XRR data in a q-range exceeding the Bragg point to have been measured in real time during PDI8-CN2 deposition. the total film thickness as determined from the Kiessig oscillations. This demonstrate that the films are coherently ordered over the entire thickness. However a quite marked difference is that Kiessig and Laue fringes persist quite pronounced for increasing PDI8-CN2 thickness when deposited at RT, whereas they get damped for increasing the film thickness for 120°. This indicates that in the former case that the film surface remains smooth during the growth, and in the latter a growth mode change from 2D/layer-by-layer growth to 3D/moud growth. Quantitative information can be achieved by analyzing the intensity oscillations in function of deposition time (or ML deposited) at different q-values.  <ref type="figure">(c-d</ref>) Growth oscillations at different qvalues extracted from the corresponding reflectivity curves.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent collaboration with the local contact Dr. Oleg Konovalov which made this challenging experiment a success. </p></div>			</div>
