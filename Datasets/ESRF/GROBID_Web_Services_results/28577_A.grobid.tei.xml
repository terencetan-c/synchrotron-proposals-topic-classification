<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diffraction and reflectivity measurements have been performed on magnesium diboride thin films grown on, (111) MgO, c-plane sapphire and c-plane sapphire with zirconium diboride buffer layer.</p><p>The aim was to study the orientation of the MgB 2 phase with respect to the different substrates. The samples were prepared by a standard two step technique in which an high temperature annealing is needed to crystallize the superconducting phase from an amorphous PLD deposited precursor.</p><p>Reciprocal space mapping measurements revealed that films deposited on (111) MgO are c-axis oriented but no in plane orientation is present. The same analysis performed on samples grown on Al 2 O 3 c-cut showed that an epitaxial interlayer of MgO between the substrate and the MgB 2 film is present, probably caused by oxygen interdiffusion from the sapphire, which is not stable at the high temperatures used for the heat treatment (900°C). The presence of the MgO layer was evidenced also by reflectivity measurements, where a superstructure was observed. In this case a single in plane orientation of the MgB 2 film has been detected, with the cell superimposed to that of MgO and rotated of 30° with respect to sapphire. Furthermore, the 101 peak of MgB 2 in the reciprocal space map resulted to be formed by two different peaks: the first, very narrow and sharp, is related to a strongly crystalline part of the sample and the other, broad and weak, suggests that also a less crystallized MgB 2 phase is present. The lattice parameters a and c calculated from the position of the two peaks are very similar to the bulk values for the narrow peak, while they are both expanded in the less crystalline phase. Deformations of crystalline lattice such as enlarged c axis, seems to be responsible for the very high upper critical fields recently observed in MgB 2 thin films.</p><p>In the case of magnesium diboride grown on ZrB 2 buffer layer, the structural characterization is not trivial, because MgB 2 and ZrB 2 peaks have the same angular position. To separate the contributes of the two layers, anomalous diffraction near the absorption energy of zirconium has been performed, thus allowing to decrease the intensity of ZrB 2 reflections with respect to the MgB 2 ones. As it was expected considering the low lattice mismatch between magnesium and zirconium diborides, the same single in plane orientation of the buffer layer was found in the superconducting film, without any rotation of the cell. MgB 2 showed a smaller a axis and an enlarged c axis with respect to the bulk values. Finally, the effect of the ZrB 2 interlayer is also to avoid oxygen contamination from the substrate; in fact, any magnesium oxide layer has been observed in this sample.  </p></div>
