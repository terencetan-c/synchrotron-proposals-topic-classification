We were successful in preforming experiments using three different silica sources in the formation of Silicalite-1 (TEOS, Ludox AS-40 and Silica Nanospheres). We were able to preform these experiments at 150 o C and at a further two different temperatures for experiments using the silica nanospheres as a silica source. The data obtained from this application has been analysed using both McSAS and SASView software packages to obtain models of particle size and their distrubitions in the systesms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TEOS</head><p>From SAXS data analysis of the formation of Silicalite-1 from TEOS it is possible to see that there is a large population of nanoparticles with a 2 nm diameter present in the starting reactant solution. This population remains visible over the first 45 minutes of the experiment; however, some of these particles grow/aggregate gradually to a size of c.a. 5nm in diameter. After roughly 30 minutes of being subjected to hydrothermal conditions a very small population of nanoparticles between 10 -20 nm in diameter can be seen. This appears to correlate with the decrease in number of the initial 2 -5 nm population observed. However, during the next 15 minutes of the experiment (45 -60 minutes) a population of particles larger that those initially observed begin to appear with diameters of c.a. &gt; 30 nm, whilst the initial population of nanoparticles under 5 nm in diameter begins to decrease steadily in number. It is at this time that the low angle Bragg peaks are first observed in the data indicating the presence of crystalline material. After the first hour of the experiment the population of very small nanoparticles begins to drop in number dramatically to a point where there are very few particles left, however, the four distinct populations of larger particles begins to grow in number, however, there is very little observed change in their overall size. It is also at this point where the intensity of the Bragg peaks begin to level off giving some indication that the &lt; 5 nm particles are perhaps amorphous in nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ludox AS-40</head><p>From looking at the in situ SAXS data for the formation of Silicalite-1 from Ludox AS-40, it can be seen that there is a small population of particles c.a. 2nm in diameter alongside a population of particles roughly 25 nm in diameter (the primary Ludox particles). It can be seen that the Ludox particles are polydispersed as also observed with microscopy. The 2nm population looks to remain for the majority of the experiment with only minor changes in population size occur, however, the Ludox particles decrease in size until the majority of particles are c.a. 18 -22 nm in diameter. This change in particle size takes roughly 5 minutes and after this time there is a slight increase in the number of 2 nm particles observed indicating that there maybe some dissolution nucleation occurring at these early stages of the reaction. It can be seen at this time that the number Ludox particles drops dramatically, however, it looks like this drop is compensated for by a broadening of the size range of the Ludox particles within the system. The smaller Ludox particles are present through to the end of the experiment, keeping an average size of c.a. 20 nm. Bragg peaks are first appear after 50 minutes of hydrothermal synthesis and grows steadily in intensity as the experiment goes on. SNS500 At the start of the experiment there are again very few sub 5 nm particles present within the system, however a population begins to grow in numbers until a peak population size is met after roughly 75 minutes. A population of larger particles can also be seen, however, after 20 -25 minutes the largest of these particles are no longer observed in the data, leaving particles in the region of 20 -50 nm in diameter. This population is present until the end of the experiment, and looks to be  growing in population size over the course of the experiment. After 100 minutes and 150 minutes two distinct populations of larger are observed and seem to grow in number until the experiment ends. Bragg peaks are first observed in this data after 60 minutes and can only be seen to correlate with the increase in population size of the sub 5 nm particles and the population growth of the larger 20 -50 nm particles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The crystallization process of silicalite-1 from three different silica sources was investigated using an in situ SAXS/WAXS study. The findings indicate the existence of two different nucleation/crystallization mechanisms present within these systems. The first mechanism of the initial formation of sub 5 nm particles and subsequent aggregation larger species that eventually densify/crystallize through the creation of an interconnected network of silica. This is then followed by the secondary growth of larger more crystalline particles. This mechanism was seen clearly when using TEOS as a silica source, but evidence was also seen with Ludox and SNS500. The second mechanistic feature in the system is the coalescence of solid silica nanoparticles through what is most likely a dissolution-recrystallization mechanism. This is observed most prominently in the SNS500 system but is also seems to be present within the Ludox systems to some extent. With the proposed mechanism for the formation of macroporous Silicalite-1 could be first modified to other MFI systems such as ZSM-5 or TS-1 and then potential into other zeolitic frameworks there could be many advantages to industry. However, to make this happen the formation of crystals via the liquid phase path observed prominently in the TEOS synthesis would need to be suppressed to make sure that the majority of crystal synthesized possess the macroporous morphology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: In-situ SAXS data for the formation of silicalite-1 from TEOS at 150 o C.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,300.96,603.12,261.12,182.88" type="bitmap" /></figure>
