<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental (the experiment was performed in remote mode due to Covid-19 restrictions):</p><p>The experiment was performed at the Spanish CRG BM25 Spline beamline (Spanish CRG beamtime assignation). Ceria (CeOx) films (10 nm) grown on Al2O3(10 nm)/Si and SiO2 substrates were studied by HAXPES and SXRD after different thermal treatments to characterize chemical and structural changes on thin films and follow, in particular, the possible interaction between film and substrate at the interface region.</p><p>Precisely, the investigation focused on the possible development and fixation of Ce 3+ states -forming cerium aluminate, CeAlO3-after different annealing processes: under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions and under H2 atmosphere (1.0•10 -5 mbar). After each of these treatments, ceria ultra-thin films were re-oxidized by exposing them to ambient conditions (room atmosphere, room temperature (RT)). The CeOx/SiO2 sample was measured for comparison purposes. In order to enhance the difference between surface and interface regions, cerium Ce 3d and Ce 2p3/2 core levels were measured above and below the total reflection (TR) angle.</p><p>The following table summarizes the experimental plan carried out: General: hν = 10 keV &amp; λ = 1.23984 Å Sample Treatment and measurements Sample Treatment and measurements CeOx/Al2O3/Si SXRD &amp; HAXPES: Ce 3d, O 1s, Al 1s, Ce2p  As inserted  Annealing at 500 °C, UHV, 1 hour  Re-oxidized: exposed to air, RT, 20 min.  Annealed at 500 °C, 10 -5 mbar, 1 hour  Re-oxidized: exposed to air, RT, 20 min.  Annealed at 500 °C, 10 -5 mbar, 1 hour  Re-oxidized: exposed to air, RT, 20 min.  Annealed at 500 °C, 10 -5 mbar, 30 min  Re-oxidized: exposed to air, RT, 20 min.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>HAXPES measurements show chemical changes under different reduction-oxidation cycles. On the one hand, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows how the A 1s peak slightly broadens after each reduction process applied on CeOx/Al2O3/Si films. According to the literature, the expected development of aluminate species (CeAlO3) at the interface would translate to a new contribution at lower binding energies than the Al2O3 peak, thus explaining the observed widening. On the other hand, the ceria film shows a change in the Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio after the different reduction/reoxidation processes (CeOx/Al2O3/Si). Figure <ref type="figure">1 a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref> shows the Ce 3d and Ce 2p (black and blue, interface and surface sensitive measurements, respectively). As it can be inferred from both measurements, the as-inserted sample is slightly reduced (especially at the surface region). However, after the first annealing process under UHV conditions, the Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio increases, showing a significant reduction of the film within all its thickness. As indicated above, simultaneously, the Al 1s core level evolution indicates the possible development of aluminate species, as expected. The sample was re-oxidized after exposed to room conditions for several minutes, recovering its initial oxidation state. Surprisingly, after the second reduction process consisting of annealing under H2 atmosphare, the ceria film does not reduce as for the UHV case, but preserves a very similar Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio from the re-oxidized sample. This result was not expected, as ceria reduction-oxidation processes are well-known to be reversible on thicker samples, actually used for oxygen storage. This reduction/oxidation cycle using H2 was repeated several times, leading to identical results. Besides, a CeOx/SiO2 sample was used for comparison purposes. Simultaneously with the previous sample, the same annealing under UHV conditions and subsequent re-oxidation processes were repeated (not shown here). In this case, the CeOx/Al2O3/Si keeps on the same behaviour, while the CeOx/SiO2 sample clearly reduces and re-oxidizes. Therefore, preliminary results indicate that the ceria/alumina interaction prevents the reversibility of changes on the Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio. SXRD measurements do not clarify the appearance of new ordered phases.</p><p>a) b) 940 920 900 880 UHV annealing Air, RT re-oxidation h = 10 keV Air, RT re-oxidation H 2 annealing As inserted Normalized Intensity (a.u.)
