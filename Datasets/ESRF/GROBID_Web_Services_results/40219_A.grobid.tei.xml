<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main aim of the present experiment was to investigate the nature of the speciation change affecting Cu upon heating of the vapour inclusions from the Mole Granite (Australia). We aimed to take advantage of recent advances of the new microprobe set-up at FAME (report 30 02 812) to collect high quality XANES as well as EXAFS from single fluid inclusions up to homogenization temperature. In addition, we aimed to compare the results obtained on these natural fluid inclusions with results from synthetic S-bearing fluid inclusions, grown under conditions similar to those inferred during the formation of the Mole Granite porphyry deposit, and with the results of measurements obtained using an autoclave system (report EC 324).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Working with natural and synthetic fluid inclusions if very challenging indeed. Finding objects buried in a 3-dimentional matrix is not trivial, and obtaining good quality spectroscopic data is made difficult by varying concentrations in different fluid inclusions, absorption by the matrix (quartz), and beam damage. We successfully collected XANES and a few EXAFS data on Cu Ka edge in fluid inclusions from 3 porphyry copper deposits. Amazingly, our results are very different from those obtained by previous researchers: while they observe Cu(II) are room-T and a linear Cu(I) complex at higher temperature, we observed that in all inclusions most of the copper is contained in a chalcopyrite inclusion, that remains to high temperature (~500˚C). This result is most probably related to the much smaller beam flux density used in our experiments (i.e., reduced beam damage).</p><p>We are using ab-initio XANES calculation using the FDMNES program to demonstrate that, in principle, we could have seen the different between chalcopyrite (in which Cu is coordinated by 4 S in tetrahedral arrangement) and an aqueous [CuS4] complex.</p><p>We did not succeed in getting any useable information from the synthetic fluid inclusions, which were quite small (&lt;10 µm, compared to a 25µm beam-size) and usually tube-shaped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publications</head><p>Since we basically obtained mainly 'negative' results in this experiment, publication is a challenge. We're hoping that this data can help to support a review of the chemistry of liquid-vapour partitioning of copper, emphasizing the experimental difficulties. Fingers crossed!</p></div>		</body>
