Microtubules are major components of the cytoskeleton in eucaryotic cells where they play various and essential roles in cell division and intercellular traffic. SCG10 is a neuron-specific protein, membrane associated and concentrated in growth cones. It binds to microtubules and induces their disassembly. We have shown the existence of a stable complex between a soluble fragment of SCG10 and two dimers of tubulin. Crystals were obtained and diffracted up to 6 Å resolution with cell parameters : P212121, a=56, b= 353, c= 466Å (D. <ref type="bibr">Fleury &amp; al., JSB, 2000, 131,156-158)</ref> We have recently obtained crystals of a complex between a shorter fragment of SCG10 (90 aminoacids instead of 131). The crystals, tested on ID14EH1, diffracted weakly up to 10 Å and the diffraction pattern showed smaller cell parameters, estimated to 220x220x45 Å.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Improvement of the crystallization is in progress.</head><p>Kinesin is a microtubule associated motor protein and plays many essential roles within eucaryotic cell. Crystals of two kinesins from Drosophila and N. asparagillus were tested. They diffracted weakly. Crystallization is in progress.</p></div>		</body>
