			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nb-doped Mg samples (Nb concentration = 1 at.% and 3 at.%) were deposited by r.f. magnetron sputtering in form of films on polished graphite wafers. To prevent the surface oxidation and stimulate the H2 dissociation at the Mg surface, samples were coated with a 15-nm-thick Pd capping layer without interrupting the vacuum conditions in the deposition chamber. After deposition, Mg samples peeled off from the substrate: the self-supporting samples were introduced in a Sievert-type apparatus to study the hydrogen sorption kinetics. Samples were submitted to several H2 sorption cycles at 623 K, each one consisting of two steps: i) the sample is exposed to 1 MPa H2 gas for 20 h to induce the H2 absorption</p></div>

The EXAFS experiment was performed at the Italian beamline GILDA of the ESRF (F) on Nb K-edge. The monochromator was equipped with two Si (311) crystals and a couple of Pt-coated mirrors working at an incidence angle of 2.7 mrad were used to reject higher harmonics. Nb EXAFS spectra were collected in fluorescence mode by a 13-elements high-purity Ge detector; samples were cooled at 80 K to limit thermal vibrations; The spectrum of a Nb foil was also Measured in transmission mode as standard reference. Data analysis was based on FEFF8-FEFFIT code.</p><p>The EXAFS spectra of the 3 and 1 at. % Nb-doped Mg films measured after H2 desorption are shown in the figure : 

spectra are pertinent to the as-deposited layer and to layers submitted to 1, 3, 5 and 8 H2-cycles. The spectrum of the as-deposited film changes upon consecutive H2-cycles and becomes progressively similar (after 5 and 8 cycles) to that of metallic Nb. This fact is more evident for Nb(3%):Mg film than for the Nb(1%):Mg one, suggesting a slower Nb aggregation at low Nb concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The results of the EXAFS analysis indicates that:</head><p>-in the first hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles, small non-bcc Nb clusters form, while part of Nb is bonded to Mg atoms; the fraction of metallic Nb and dispersed fraction depends on the Nb concentration.</p><p>-after many (about 10) cycles all Nb is in form of bcc clusters.</p><p>These results shed light on the rapid hydrogen kinetics observed during the first cycles; a paper is in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>EXAFS spectra on Nb-doped Mg layers after subsequent hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles (the cycle number is indcated</figDesc></figure>
