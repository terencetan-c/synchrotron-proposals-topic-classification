<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Recently, Weber et al. (Phys. Rev. B 82, 085105 (2010)) reported a high-resolution resonant inelastic hard xray scattering (Mn K edge RIXS) investigation of the bilayer manganites La 2-2x Sr 1+2x Mn 2 O 7 with x = 0.36 and x = 0.50. They "observe a clear dispersion of up to 0.5 eV in the measured q range, which is direct evidence of the nonlocal character of dd excitation". We think that soft x-ray (Mn L 3 edge) RIXS would represent a more conclusive test on the dispersion of dd excitations in these compounds, since it directly probes Mn-3d electrons.</p><p>We mailny focused on samples of the type La 2-2x Sr 1+2x Mn 2 O 7 , with nominal doping x = 0.50. Note that, given the Mn L 3 edge resonance (around 640 eV), the in-plane lattice parameter of La 2- 2x Sr 1+2x Mn 2 O 7 compounds (≈ 3.87 Å) and the scattering angle set by the spectrometer (fixed at 2θ = 130°), the fraction of the Brillouin Zone that can be probed within this experiment is approximately 55%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the dependence of the spectral features of the sample at half doping (x = 0.50) vs. the incoming photon energy both for linear horizontal (black) and vertical (red) polarization. Excitations energies are indicated in the absorption profile in the right panel. Mn K edge RIXS measurement evidenced a "2 eV feature" (assigned to dd excitations), which is better seen here due to the relative higher energy resolution of the present experiment. Actually, we were able to resolve several features in the low-energy loss region of the spectra (1 to 3 eV), well separated from the quasi-elastic peak. They have a strong dependence on the incident photon energy: the relative intensities of the features at about 1.1 and 2.3 eV changes remarkably when moving across the absorption edge. In the pre-edge region (excitation energy A), both of them are dramatically suppressed. The width of these features is much larger than the experimental resolution indicating that multiple structures are likely to be present. In the high-energy loss region, a feature at constant emitted photon energy is present (fluorescence). Possibly, a second one at intermediate energy loss can be recognized, moving in the Raman representation from about 2.4 eV at excitation energy B to 5.3 eV at excitation energy F. No evident dichroism is present when switching from one polarization to another. This fact is better documented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, in which spectra with higher statistics at two selected angles and at one incident photon energy (excitation energy D of Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) are shown. The two angles θ = 0° and -50° typically represent two interesting cases (θ is the angle of the incoming photon beam with respect to the sample normal), that is normal incidence and normal emission conditions, respectively. However, just a small increase in the counting rate is seen when moving from linear horizontal to vertical polarization, with no appreciable change in the shape of the overall spectrum.</p><p>-1 4 -1 2 -1 0 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 0 40 80 120 La 2-2x Sr 1+2x Mn 2 O 7 (x = 0.5) Mn-L 3 RIXS sample A: (0,0) --&gt; (π,0); T = 20 K θ = 0° (Normal Incidence) slits 30 30; 4 hours each spectrum peak D: En = 642.0 eV Resolution = 180 meV intensity (a.u.) energy loss (eV) V pol H pol. -14 -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 0 40 80 120 La 2-2x Sr 1+2x Mn 2 O 7 (x = 0.5) Mn-L 3 RIXS sample A: (0,0) --&gt; (π,0); T = 20 K θ = -50° (Normal Emission) slits 30 30; 4 hours each spectrum peak D: En = 642.0 eV Resolution = 180 meV intensity (a.u.) energy loss (eV) V pol. H pol. We thus decided to switch to circularly polarized light (being the flux provided by the undulators twice as much that in the case of linear polarization, for technical reasons) to study the momentum dependence of the Raman features at 1.1 and 2.3 eV. The study was carried out along two directions of the Brillouin Zone, that is the (0,0) → (π,0) and the (0,0) → (π,π) on sample A and B, respectively. The projection of the transferred momentum in the ab-plane is changed by rotating the sample by an angle δ = θ + 25° (q ║ ~ sin δ ). δ = 0° represent the specular-geometry case, for which q ║ ≡ 0, i.e. the Γ = (0,0) point is sampled. As one can see in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> a clear dispersion has not been seen, but</p><p>• the shape of the features changes, and</p><p>• their intensity evolves as well.</p><p>- </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1: sample A (x = 0.50).
