We raised the possibility that (1) the 2013 results from brain tissue were a combination of biological/metabolic iodine (from IAA) and counter-stain; and (2) that the biological iodine signal had degraded within the epon matrix of the brain tissue since 2013. Even if one takes into account what iodine is known to counter-stain, i.e., starch, the spatial distribution of I fluorescence from the 2013 results does not correspond readily nor reproducibly to intracellular glucose (or glycogen) in the neurons. We further attempted fluorescence measurements using unused brain sections from successful HEXRF Gd measurements performed at IDE at Argonne National Laboratory in 2013, and again, no fluorescence signal was obtained at ID21. Finally, with the main safety officer and principal beamline scientist, we constructively discussed how to remove any unwanted (non-biological) background signals from the preparations, with minimal handling of the tissue following the in vivo experiments, tissue fixation and transport to the ESRF. This is the subject to be proposed for the next proposal period in September in support for additional beam time, as resubmission of the combined PET and synchrotron x-ray manuscript hinges on the aforementioned goal and experimental results.</p></div>		</body>
