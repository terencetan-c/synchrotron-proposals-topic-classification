<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Colloidal inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) with engineered structural and geometric parameters are at the forefront of the current scientific revolution of nanoscience. They serve as model systems for the study of physical-chemical phenomena in nanoscale solids and as indispensable ingredients for the bottomup development of artificial functional materials, miniaturized devices, and innovative concepts in optoelectronics, biomedicine, and catalysis. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Currently, new challenges are being imposed on nanochemistry research to satisfy the rising demand for advanced generations of wet-chemically synthesized NC-based entities that should not only exhibit reinforced properties, but also demonstrate diversified capabilities to be simultaneously exploitable in multiple applications. One frontier approach envisages construction of multicomponent nanoheterostructures, referred to as hybrid NCs (HNCs), in which two or more distinct domains of selected metals, semiconductors, and/or oxides are interconnected through epitaxial bonding interfaces in elaborate spatial configurations. Examples of HNCs with a topologically defined composition span from concentric or eccentric core/shell geometries involving large junctions between the component materials, to oligomer-like architectures made of shape-tailored sections sharing small contact areas. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> Elaboration of HNCs transcribes a new paradigm in synthetic nanochemistry, whereby higher level of structural-architectural complexity is pursued as a means of boosting the technological potential of conventional nanoparticles beyond the limitations dictated by their compositional and geometric parameters. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> Indeed, HNCs offer enhanced functionality stemming from integration of nonhomologous properties over a unique inorganic platform on which multiple surfaces are chemically addressable at once. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> Electronic interfacing across neighboring domains through the relevant heterojunctions can underlie interesting exchange-coupling mechanisms, often leading to synergistically amplified chemical-physical responses or even emergence of entirely new phenomena.  Suitable heterostructure engineering is ultimately expected to open up unprecedented scenarios in many applications fields, such as optoelectronics, biomedicine, sensing, catalysis, and fabrication of smart artificial mesoscopic materials, where multimodal imaging, detection, targeting, and therapeutic actions, on one side, and programmable organization of NC-based superlattices, on the other side, are greatly needed. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> The synthesis of HNCs in colloidal media poses several major obstacles to surmount. Controllable HNC fabrication indeed requires that the relevant material component domains should evolve under thermodynamic and kinetic regimes guaranteeing a surface-interface energy balance favorable to creation of bonding connections between dissimilar crystal lattices. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> One widely exploited approach to achieve this goal relies on the socalled "seeded growth", whereby preformed NCs serve as primary nucleation centers that can accommodate deposition of secondary inorganic portions of different materials from the respective molecular precursors. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> The large variety of elaborate HNCs, which has so far become available, supports the general applicability and effectiveness of this synthetic tool. Nevertheless, despite the apparent technical simplicity of seeded techniques, development of versatile protocols that can allow deliberate selection of distinct spatial arrangements for heterostructures made of a given material association yet remains one of the most unsatisfactorily addressed issues. Access to HNCs in nonequivalent configurations within the frame of the same synthetic scheme has in fact been proven to be viable in a few cases only, whereby topology switchability has often been achieved to the detriment of a limited size range of geometric parameters over which the component material domains can be tailored. Examples include binary and ternary hetero-oligomers of Fe 3 O 4 -CdS, 3 Au-InAs, 4 Au-PbS(or Te), 5 Au-Fe 3 O 4 , <ref type="bibr">5a,6</ref> PbS(or Se)-Au-Fe 3 O 4 , 5a,7 FePt-CdS(or Se), <ref type="bibr">8</ref> and PdS x -CdS 9 in either core@shell, peanut-, or dumbbell-like configurations, linear and/or branched architectures based on CdX materials (X ) S, Se, Te), 10 heterostructures made of site-selectively decorated rod-like sections, such as of CdS(or Se)-Au, <ref type="bibr">11</ref> CdS(or Se)-PbSe, <ref type="bibr">12</ref> CdSe-Co, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> CdSe@CdS-Au(or Co), 11a,14 TiO 2 -Co, 15 TiO 2 -ZnO, <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Au-Co (or Te), <ref type="bibr">17</ref> and striped CdS-Ag 2 S nanorods. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Identification of pathways to HNC topology selection is intrinsically challenging, because the ultimate heterostructure geometry and configuration can transcribe the interplay of heterogeneous nucleation with other complex mechanisms, such as solid-state atomic diffusion or exchange, <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> redox proces-ses, <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> photoinduced or thermal activation, 11 electrochemical ripening, 11b,c phasesegregation, 9 andcrystal-orientedattachment. <ref type="bibr">5a,9</ref> Current expertise remains hindered by an insufficient understanding of the genuine impact of the inherent characteristics of the seeds, such as their crystal structure, <ref type="bibr">6b,10b-d,14</ref> size/ shape, <ref type="bibr">3,5,10c</ref> faceting, <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> and surface defects, 11 on the evolution of HNCs thereof when significant interfacial polarization 6a,17c and misfit strain <ref type="bibr">3,5a,6,7,9a,15,18</ref> intervene at the relevant heterojunctions. Unravelling how these factors determine the preference of foreign material domains to be implanted onto distinct locations of seeds under operation of kinetically driven deposition processes <ref type="bibr">3c,10a,d</ref> is an essential prerequisite to achieving increased level of synthetic sophistication and predictable functionalities. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> As of today, the most ambitious objective in HNC development remains to innovate current preparative routes, which most commonly rely on empirically determined sets of optimal reaction conditions, by rational synthetic criteria founded on deep structural insight and solid mechanistic knowledge. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In this work, we demonstrate a leap forward in the topological control of HNCs belonging to the yet scarcely tackled realm of heterostructures entirely made of transition-metal oxides, on which synthetic progress has, in fact, been limited, as compared to other material associations. <ref type="bibr">1c,16,19</ref> We address the wetchemical fabrication and characterization of novel HNC architectures-based semiconductor TiO 2 and ferromagnetic spinel iron oxide (henceforth referred to as Fe x O y ), two technologically important materials that hold great technological potential as adsorptive, <ref type="bibr">20-23 catalytic, 20,23,24</ref> and (photo)catalytic platforms, <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">25</ref> and as tools for biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics. <ref type="bibr">20b,26</ref> Beyond conventional magnetically addressable core/shell TiO 2 / Fe x O y composite architectures, our group has recently reported the synthesis of HNCs individually comprising a single rodshaped TiO 2 section longitudinally decorated with one or more Fe x O y spherical portions, respectively. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> As a major drawback, the relative domain positioning could not be controlled and/or interfacial strain dictated the size range over which the heterostructure geometric parameters could be adjusted. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Using the TiO 2 /Fe x O y couple as a model material platform for heteroepitaxial growth via colloidal nonaqueous seeding techniques, herein we show that the combination of accurate seed engineering with appropriate reaction pathways, capable of accentuating anisotropic reactivity, allows a higher degree of flexibility in the selection of nonquivalent HNC architectures. These concepts are illustrated through the synthetic outcome of a robust two-step strategy by which TiO 2 -Fe x O y heterodimer HNCs can be synthesized with controlled topologies and geometric parameters independently tunable over a wide size range. This colloidal system is particularly suitable to address the inherent impact of the TiO 2 seed structure on the formation of TiO 2 -Fe x O y heterostructures thereof, as no redox or atomic exchange reactions complicate structural-compositional characterization and mechanistic understanding. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> Our approach exploits brookite TiO 2 nanorods, distinguished by a specific shape-tapered profile and arrow-like terminations, as anisotropically reactive seeds in a hot surfactant mixture to which an organometallic iron precursor is controllably supplied. It is demonstrated that selective heterogeneous nucleation and growth of a single cubic-phase iron oxide domain can be attained at either one apex or at any location along the longitudinal sidewalls of the nanorod substrates. The synthetic achievements have been authenticated by combining X-ray diffraction and absorption measurements with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations, complemented by analysis of lattice fringe contrast amplitude and displacement. These studies have enabled detailed assessment of the topologically defined arrangement of the HNCs, determination of the crystallographic relationships holding between the component material domains, and mapping of lattice strain distribution across individual heterostructures. With the support of such structural knowledge, the experimental results are interpreted within the frame of various models offering complementary mechanistic views of HNC formation. The different HNC architectures are concluded to be approximately equivalent in terms of the surface-interface energy change associated with their formation. We rationalize the possibility of selecting HNC topology on the basis of a diffusion-controlled mechanistic picture allowing Fe x O y heterogeneous nucleation on the NR seeds to switch from a thermodynamically controlled to a kinetically overdriven deposition regime. It is proposed that the chemical accessibility of the seeds is governed by the spatial inhomogeneity of the chemical potential environment around them, whereby the anisotropic reactivity offered by the unique structural features of the NR apexes is conveniently accentuated under high fluxes of monomer species. Finally, the multifunctional potential of the Fe x O y -TiO 2 heterostructures is highlighted through investigation of their rich magnetic and photocatalytic properties, which are found to diverge from those otherwise exhibited, respectively, by their individual material components or physical mixtures thereof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Section</head><p>2.1. Materials. All chemicals were of the highest purity available and were used as received. Titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl 4 , 99.999%), iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5 , 98%), dodecan-1,2-diol (C 12 H 24 (OH) 2 or DDIOL, 90%), oleic acid (C 17 H 33 CO 2 H or OLAC, 90%), oleyl amine (C 17 H 33 NH 2 or OLAM, 70%), 1-octadecene (C 18 H 36 or ODE, 90%), fullerene (C 60 , 99.5%), and Uniblue A (UBA, sodium salt; the molecular structure is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> of the Supporting Information) were purchased from Aldrich. All solvents used were of analytical grade.</p><p>2.2. Synthesis Procedures. All syntheses were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere using a standard Schlenk line setup.</p><p>Preparation of TiO 2 Nanorod Seeds. Size-tunable brookite TiO 2 nanorods (b-TiO 2 NRs) with tapered shape were synthesized by using a recently developed protocol with minor modifications. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Briefly, 3 g of ODE, 10 mmol of OLAM, and 1 mmol of OLAC were loaded into a three-neck flask and degassed at 120 °C for 30 min, after which the mixture was cooled to 50 °C under N 2 flow. At this point, 1 mmol of TiCl 4 was added, and the flask was heated up to 280 °C at a ramp rate of ∼20 °C/min and kept at this temperature for 30 min. Next, the reaction could be either halted by removing the heating mantle and allowing rapid cooling, or continued upon alternating additions of a 0.5 M OLAC/ODE solution (injected in single portion) and of a 0.5 M TiCl 4 /ODE solution (delivered at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/min by means of a syringe pump). The NR size could be enlarged by injecting increasing amounts of the secondary TiCl 4 /OLAC reactants up to a maximum of ∼20 mmol of TiCl 4 . After the synthesis, the b-TiO 2 NRs were precipitated under ambient atmosphere upon addition of a 1:1v/v 2-propanol:acetone mixture, separated by centrifugation, and then washed three times with acetone to remove any reactant and solvent residuals. The purified NRs were used to prepare stable b-TiO 2 seed stock solutions (in CHCl 3 or toluene), the concentration of which was checked by ICP-AES analysis prior to further use.</p><p>Synthesis of b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y HNCs. HNCs made of joint b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y sections were synthesized by adapting literature protocols developed for other types of TiO 2 seeds. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Calibrated amounts of the b-TiO 2 NR stock solution, DDIOL, OLAM, and OLAC were codissolved in 10 mL of ODE in a 50 mL three-neck flask. The mixture was pumped to vacuum for 30 min at 120 °C, after which it was heated under N 2 flux to 280 °C. After 15 min equilibration, 1 mL of a room-temperature 0.1-1 M Fe(CO) 5 solution in previously degassed ODE was rapidly injected into the vigorously stirred seed-containing mixture where the TiO 2 concentration could vary in the 0.001-0.01 M range. In standard matchstick-generating syntheses, the initial TiO 2 :OLAC:OLAM:DDIOL molar ratio was optimized to 1:1.5:0.75:1.25, 19 while the Fe(CO) 5 :TiO 2 molar ratio generally ranged from 1:1 to 10:1. The Fe(CO) 5 injection caused a sudden temperature drop of ∼20-40 °C, after which the temperature was allowed to slowly recover to 280 °C and maintained at this level. The onset of iron oxide nucleation, marked by a rapid darkening of the solution, was characterized by an induction time of 1-3 min, which was inversely proportional to the amount of Fe(CO) 5 injected. After heating for 1 h, the reaction could be either halted or continued upon delivering an additional 2-10 mL of Fe(CO) 5 :OLAC feedstock precursor (prepared in a separated flask under N 2 at a Fe:OLAC molar ratio of 1:1.5) at a rate of 0.1 mL/ min by means of a syringe pump. Finally, the flask was allowed to cool to 130 °C and exposed to air for an additional 1 h to complete Fe x O y oxidation. The HNC product was separated from the growing mixture upon 2-propanol addition and subsequently subjected to three cycles of redissolution in CHCl 3 and precipitation with acetone to wash out reactant residuals. The final hydrophobically capped HNCs were fully dispersible in a variety of nonpolar solvents (such as hexane, toluene, or chloroform), providing optically clear colloidal solutions.</p><p>Synthesis of b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y Physical Mixtures. For comparison purposes, corresponding b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y physical mixtures were prepared by mixing at room temperature appropriate volumes of solutions containing purified NRs and Fe x O y NCs synthesized in an independent step (in the absence of seeds using a 3-fold higher reactant concentration).</p><p>2.3. Characterization. 2.3.1. Elemental Analysis. The Ti and Fe atomic contents of the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurements with a Varian Vista AX spectrometer. The samples for analyses were digested in concentrated HCl/HNO 3 (3/1 v/v). Unless otherwise stated, the concentration of TiO 2 and Fe x O y was expressed in terms of TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 molecular units. When needed, the molecular TiO 2 concentration was translated into TiO 2 seed concentration (expressed as number of seeds per unit volume) by considering the average mass of a single NR calculated on the basis of the mean NR length and diameter and the density of bulk brookite (4.12 g/cm 3 ).</p></div>

A whole profile XRD fitting was performed by using the software FULLPROF based on the Rietveld method, which takes into account NC shape anisotropy by means of spherical harmonics. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> The initial crystallographic data used for the fits were the following bulk values: a I41/amd space group and unit cell parameters a ) b ) 3.7852 Å, c ) 9.5139 Å for anatase TiO 2 ; a Pbca space group and unit cell parameters a ) 9.174 Å, b ) 5.449 Å, c ) 5.138 Å for brookite TiO 2 ; a P43 3 2 space group and a unit cell size a ) b ) c ) 8.3457 Å for γ-Fe 2 O 3 (maghemite); and a Fd-3m space group and unit cell size a ) b ) c ) 8.3965 Å for Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite). The fits were accomplished under the initial assumption that the NRs could be made of anatase and/or brookite TiO 2 , while the HNCs could be composed of TiO 2 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 , TiO 2 / Fe 3 O 4 , or TiO 2 /Fe 3 O 4 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 mixtures. The accuracy of the fits was evaluated on the basis of a goodness-of-fit statistical indicator (GOF) that takes the value of 1 for an ideal fit. Given the high count rate of the pattern intensity, GOF values of &lt;5-6 were considered to be satisfactory. For the sake of comparison, refined cell parameters were calculated for b-TiO 2 in the starting NRs and in HNCs thereof, which allowed estimating changes in b-TiO 2 unit cell volume following Fe x O y overgrowth.</p><p>2.3.4. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. X-ray absorption nearedge structure spectroscopy (XANES) measurements at the Fe K-edge energy were performed at room temperature in transmission mode at the BM25 Spanish CRG Beamline (SpLine) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Two gas ionization chambers, filled with nitrogen and argon, were used to measure the incident and the transmitted beam, respectively. Samples for analysis were in powdered form and placed onto a kapton tape located in the beam path at room temperature. The powder amount to be mounted was calculated so as to achieve similar signal intensity for all of the samples. Several scans were taken to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Bulk γ-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 powders were also measured for comparison purposes. Data were normalized applying the same normalization parameters for all of the spectra by means of an in-house software (Athena).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5.">Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).</head><p>Low-resolution TEM images were recorded with a Jeol Jem 1011 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Phase-contrast highresolution TEM (HRTEM) experiments were performed by using a Jeol 2010F TEM/STEM microscope operating at 200 keV, which corresponded to an electron wavelength of 0.00251 nm. The objective lens had a spherical aberration coefficient of 0.47 ( 0.01 nm and hence a resolution at optimum defocus of 0.19 nm. Samples for analysis were prepared by dropping a dilute NR or HNC solution in toluene onto carbon-coated copper grids and then allowing the solvent to evaporate.</p><p>Crystal-Phase Mapping. Crystal-phase maps of the nanostructures were constructed by analyzing the local amplitude of the HRTEM periodicities characteristic of each crystal phase. To this aim, the Fourier transform of the HRTEM image was treated according to the approach developed by M. J. Hy ¨tch, described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">19a,29</ref> The results were translated into false-color maps, in which areas featured by the same periodicity were represented by a fixed chromatic scale based on a different color for each crystal phase. The topological variations of the color intensity and hue, being proportional to the local amplitude of the concerned HRTEM fringes, were expressed relative to a percentage chromatic scale, whereby 100% was assigned to the location across the nanostructure at which the intensity of the concerned fringes was maximum, while 0% corresponded to the intensity of the same fringes in a region outside the crystal lattice.</p><p>Strain Mapping. To probe strain effects induced in the TiO 2 NRs upon formation of b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y heterojunctions, in-plane b-TiO 2 strain maps were calculated both for the bare NRs and for the HNCs thereof using the program STEM_CELL 30 that is based on the well-established geometric phase analysis (GPA) developed by M. J. <ref type="bibr">Hy ¨tch et al. 19b,</ref><ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">31</ref> The GPA technique allows the relative extent of lattice fringe distortion across the nanostructures to be evaluated with respect to an "unstrained" area within the twodimensional projected lattice, which is taken as a reference. In the case of the bare NRs, the reference area was selected in the middle of the nanostructure, while in the case of b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y HNCs, the reference area was selected in a region of the TiO 2 section, which was located at least ∼10 nm away from the interface shared with the Fe x O y domain. The suitability of the reference choice was checked by verifying that the strain level converged to a constant value thereon. The results of the analyses were used to construct false-color strain maps, each tracing the topological changes associated with a specific lattice distortion component that contributed to the overall strain: (i) fringe deformation (dilatation/ contraction) in the direction perpendicular (D xx ) or parallel to the long NR axis (D yy ), fringe rotation (R xy ), and shear strain (S xy ).</p><p>2.3.6. Magnetic Characterization. Magnetic measurements were performed on dry HNC or NR/Fe x O y mixture powder samples, mounted on identical holders, using a MPMS Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Samples were handled under air using plastic tools and gloves to avoid metal contamination at any step of sample manipulation. The thermal dependence of the magnetization was measured after zero-field cooling (ZFC) under an applied field of 50 Oe. Magnetization curves were measured at 5 and 300 K applying a magnetic field up to 20 KOe. The results were normalized to the iron oxide mass in the samples (assuming a Fe 2 O 3 stoichiometry), estimated by ICP-AES measurements.</p><p>2.3.7. Photocatalytic Experiments. The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructures was assessed by probing their photoinduced charging capability, according to established approaches. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> All experiments were carried out using anhydrous solvents under nitrogen atmosphere in a glovebox. Briefly, 1 cm quartz cuvettes were filled with a solution containing the desired amount of purified nanostructures (either b-TiO 2 NRs, HNCs, corresponding physical mixture, or bare Fe x O y NCs) dissolved in CHCl 3 (or toluene) and ethanol at 80:20 v/v. The typical concentrations were in the range: [TiO 2 ] ) 0.1-10 mM, [Fe x O y ] ) 0.1-1 mM, respectively. The cuvettes were sealed by a Teflon-faced rubber cap, transferred out of the glovebox, and illuminated for 1-3 h with a 365 ( 10 nm He:Hg lamp (400 µW/cm 2 ) positioned at a distance of 5 cm. To titrate electrons stored on the nanostructured photocatalysts, 10-100 µL of concentrated solution of acceptor molecules, UBA 32a in dissolved in ethanol or C 60 32b,c dissolved in CHCl 3 , was syringed through the septum of the cuvette under strict exclusion of air. The reaction course was followed spectrophotometrically by recording differential spectra after each addition. Either the unirradiated or the preirradiated photocatalyst solution was used as the reference. In complementary sets of experiments, reductive decolorization of UBA was accomplished under continuous light irradiation in the presence of the selected photocatalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We have realized the selective synthesis of topologically controlled binary metal-oxide HNCs by devising a robust seeded-growth strategy that involves the following main steps. First, a high-temperature surfactant-assisted nonhydrolytic route 27 is exploited to prepare uniform, size-tunable b-TiO 2 NRs that are elongated in the c-axis direction of the orthorhombic brookite lattice and specifically possess a pronounced tapered profile with structurally dissimilar arrow-shaped terminations. In a subsequent separate step, b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y HNCs are generated upon reacting thoroughly purified b-TiO 2 seeds dissolved in a ternary ligand environment (composed of OLAM, OLAC, and DDIOL in ODE) with a calibrated volume of a Fe(CO) 5 / ODE solution injected at 290 °C under inert atmosphere. <ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">33</ref> On demand, supplementary additions of a secondary Fe(CO) 5 : OLAC feedstock mixture at judiciously slow rate can be performed to sustain enlargement of the Fe x O y domains to the desired size. After reaction completion and extraction/purification procedures, the final surfactant-coated hydrophobic nanoheterostructures result in being fully soluble in a variety of nonpolar solvents (such as hexane, toluene, or chloroform), providing optically clear solutions.</p><p>3.1. Synthesis and Structural Analysis of TiO 2 Seeds. We have first carried out an in-depth size-morphological and structural study of the particular b-TiO 2 NRs, which have been exploited as starting substrates for Fe x O y overgrowth. Such knowledge is an underlying prerequisite to rationalization of their inherent site-selective seeding capabilities in the process of Fe x O y deposition.</p><p>The b-TiO 2 NRs were prepared via OLAM-induced aminolysis of a titanium oleate complex that was formed upon reacting TiCl 4 in ODE-diluted OLAC:OLAM mixtures at 280 °C under inert atmosphere. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> The low-magnification TEM gallery in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> summarizes the outcome of various syntheses performed by decomposing increasingly larger amounts of equimolar TiCl 4 :OLAC reactants at a fixed value of the OLAM content in the reaction flask. Single-step preparations at relatively low precursor loading led to roughly ellipsoidal NRs frequently characterized by an asymmetric short axis shrinking in proximity of their terminal sections, which conferred them delicate profiles as diverse as tear-, bullet-, and nail-like (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Upon feeding with extra reactants, the NRs acquired progressively larger volumes and tended to adopt a more tapered shape with pronounced longitudinal bending, while still exhibiting sharp apexes with variable shapes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>). Proper regulation of the synthesis parameters allowed the nanostructure diameter and the length to be adjusted in the 3-10 nm and 30-180 nm intervals, respectively, which ultimately afforded NRs with aspect ratio easily tunable from ∼4 to ∼15 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-d</ref>). In this nonaqueous system, the low crystal symmetry of brookite lattice and facet-competitive surfactant adhesion on the growing nanostructures underlie anisotropic growth, 34 while the particular morphological evolution of the b-TiO 2 NRs toward an accentuated tapered habit is specifically promoted by a low OLAM concentration in the starting environment, which then becomes progressively enriched with OLAC along the course of the secondary TiCl 4 :OLAC feedstock injections. <ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">34</ref> The crystal phase composition b-TiO 2 NRs was confirmed by SR-XRD analysis of powder samples. The representative pattern in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (trace a), corresponding to NRs with short/ long axis of 5 ( 0.8 nm/60 ( 4 nm, matches well with the profile of the bulk brookite (orthorhombic) crystalline phase, as highlighted by the emergence of the distinctive (121), (022), and (221) reflections, not otherwise found for the structurally similar anatase polymorph. 23b Deviations in the relative peak intensity ratio, as compared to that found in the bulk pattern, and inhomogeneous line broadening arise from the inherent shape anisotropy of the NRs, 23b,27 as confirmed by satisfactory fitting of the experimental SR-XRD patterns obtained by means of a Rietvel-based software program. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> Similar results were reported for NRs possessing varying geometric features in the 20-200 nm range.</p><p>Phase-contrast HRTEM investigations, supported by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and fringe analyses on the relevant images, disclosed important structural details of the assynthesized seeds. The collected data, summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, demonstrate that the NRs were indeed constituted of singlecrystalline TiO 2 expanded along the c-axis of the orthorhombic brookite structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>,<ref type="figure">g-n</ref>). The fact that the local FFTs calculated from different regions across the NR length slightly diverge from each other, while often displaying elongated diffraction spots (bottom insets in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>,<ref type="figure">o-w</ref>), correlates with the noticeable crystal deformation that is associated with the longitudinal curvature of the NRs. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> To gain a deeper insight into the degree of lattice strain tolerated by the NRs, we traced local changes in the HRTEM contrast amplitude of the visible fringes and assessed the extent of their spatial displacement through suitable analysis techniques relying on the treatment of the Fourier transform components of the HRTEM images. <ref type="bibr">19a,29-31,35</ref> First, point-to-point variations in the visibility of the most prominent crystal-phase periodicities across the NRs were visualized into topological crystal-phase maps <ref type="bibr">19a,27,35</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>,<ref type="figure">e</ref>). These maps evidenced appreciable alterations in the HRTEM contrast amplitude (up to a 40-50% decrease) of the concerned lattice planes across the NR length, as preliminarily grasped from the parent HRTEM image (additional examples can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S2</ref> of the Supporting Information). These findings can be interpreted by considering that local atomic plane tilting associated with in-and/or out-of-plane longitudinal bending of the NRs results in misalignment of portions of the nanostructures relative to their exact zone axis condition and, consequently, in attenuation of the relative HRTEM contrast intensity.</p><p>Second, the detailed distribution of strain across the NRs was probed by means of the GPA approach. <ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">35</ref> The analysis of HRTEM contrast variation by this methodology allows decoupling the overall tension experienced by the crystal lattice into its main projected components. Therefore, the percentage degrees of (i) in-plane fringe deformation in the direction perpendicular or parallel to the long NR axis (D xx and D yy , respectively), (ii) fringe rotation (R xy ), and (iii) shear strain (S xy ) were evaluated with respect to a reference area (to which D xx ) D xy ) 0%, R xy ) 0°, and S xy ) 0% were assigned) arbitrarily selected in the nanostructure center, and used to construct corresponding topological maps of strain distribution. In these maps, the color scale and the signs "+" and "-" denote, respectively, the extent and the direction of the change of the particular strain component concerned, relative to the reference. Taking into account the inherent limits imposed by electron delocalization and statistic noise in the HRTEM image, <ref type="bibr">35</ref> the ultimate accuracy achievable in strain determination by GPA was assessed to be the order of less than 1% (see Appendix in the Supporting Information). The representative data reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>,f show that the D xx , D yy , and S xy components in the NRs generally exhibit only minor oscillations (i.e., of the same order as the GPA accuracy) that are randomly localized across their length. Differently, the R xy map reveals a monotonic excursion of the degree of lattice rotation, which overall reaches up to about 9-14°, as the concerned fringes span the entire NR section from one tip to the opposite one. Therefore, it could be concluded that the b-TiO 2 lattice of the bare seeds was affected by insignificant dilatation or contraction, while the sole source of non-negligible strain stemmed from plane bending along the c-axis, which accounted for the NR longitudinal curvature.</p><p>The surface faceting of the NRs was analyzed in depth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>,<ref type="figure">g-n</ref>). Under the observed projections, the most developed longitudinal sidewalls that enclosed the NRs were generally found to be relatively smooth facets of the (2,1,0), (2,2,0), and (1,0,0) type families. On the other hand, the surface arrangement at the apex regions showed a richer structural diversity that appeared to depend on the NR size. The smaller NRs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>) generally terminated at one or both sides with highly atomically corrugated or stepped tips, on which defined sets of facets could not be unambiguously identified due to their exceedingly small extension and the intrinsic limitations imposed by fringe delocalization effects. Medium-sized NRs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g-i</ref>,<ref type="figure">l</ref>,<ref type="figure">m</ref>) generally carried only one extremely rough apex with either completely indeterminate faceting or with high-index surfaces, such as of the (1,1,1), (2,1,1), ( <ref type="formula">212</ref>), (h,0,2) type (with h ) (3, (4), while somewhat (0,0,1) type facets were most commonly deduced at the opposite side. The pronounced asymmetric nanostructure sharpening already appreciable in the low-magnification TEM galleries was consistent with these findings (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As their average size and aspect ratio increased, the NRs exhibited a higher degree of surface regularity, which transcribed into the availability of proportionally more extended facets of the aforementioned families at both terminations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>,<ref type="figure">k</ref>,<ref type="figure">n</ref>). It was remarkable that, in most cases, the NRs were individually distinguished by substantially different structural arrangements at their apexes (additional examples of NR faceting can be found in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S2-S4</ref> in the Supporting Information).</p><p>These analyses of faceting above show that the NR surface composition deviates from that predicted theoretically on the basis of the Wulff construction, according to which most of the surface in equilibrium-shape unpassivated brookite crystals should be distributed among (1,1,1), (2,1,0), (0,1,0), and reconstructed (0,0,1) type facets. For example, the observed NR sharpening highlights the tendency of the system to eliminate the unstable basal (0,0, (1) sides, which are expected to develop the fastest, in favor of slower-growing higher-index oblique facets, such as, for example, of the (2,1,1) and (2,1,2) type, <ref type="bibr">1a,34,36-38</ref> as indeed observed by us. In addition, the asymmetric profile of NR tapering unequivocally points to dissimilar growth rates along the two opposite directions of the c-axis, which would contrast with expectations based on the  The GOF indicators were &lt;2-3 in all cases. Any possible anatase contamination was verified to be of the order of 2-3%, which is within the accuracy of the fitting procedure and, therefore, considered to be negligible. centrosymmetry of the orthorhombic brookite unit cell structure 23b,34 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5</ref> in the Supporting Information). The complex NR shaping mode verified experimentally can be better explained as arising from accentuation of anisotropic crystal development assisted by facet-preferential surfactant binding under far-from-equilibrium growth conditions. Actually, according to the Mullins-Sekerka instability model, 34b,37 fast NC evolution in a diffusion-limited regime under intense monomer fluxes can involve a large probability of violent growth fluctuations in proximity of high-energy crystal sites (e.g., edges, corners, asperities), which could lead, for instance, to imperfect atom addition or lattice restructuring, as well as to huge enhancement of crystal development rate thereon. Emergence of such kinetic instabilities can largely concur not only to promote arrow-like shaping via disappearance of the fastestgrowing facets in favor of more stable lower-energy surfaces at the NR apexes, but also to drive the independent evolution of the latter, as observed for other systems. <ref type="bibr">1a,34</ref> 3.2. Synthesis and Topological Control of HNCs. The high synthetic flexibility in the selection of b-TiO 2 NRs with tailored geometric features and peculiar surface faceting at the apexes transcribed into the availability of substrate seeds that could potentially exhibit anisotropic reactivity, that is, spatially dependent accessibility toward Fe x O y deposition under suitable conditions. The results of the following sets of experiments illustrate how the seeding capabilities of the b-TiO 2 NRs were deduced through scrutinizing the impact of their geometric features as well of the reaction kinetics on the formation of b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y HNCs with programmable topologies.</p><p>Tip-Selective HNC Growth. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> demonstrates the degree of topological selectivity achieved by syntheses that combined the following conditions: (a) use of short-to-medium aspectratio b-TiO 2 NRs as seeds; and (b) addition of a fixed volume of rather concentrated Fe(CO) 5 solution (1 M) in the primary fast-injection step. The corresponding reaction details are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The TEM overview reveals the highyield formation (&gt;95%) of composite objects made of asymmetrically tipped rod-like sections, which exhibit a distinguishable image contrast variation across their profile. On the basis of the known decomposition pathways of Fe(CO) 5 in hot surfactant mixtures, 33 the obtained hybrid nanostructures could be preliminary interpreted as being individually constituted of a single nearly spherical head domain of Fe x O y selectively attached to either terminations of one of the original TiO 2 NR seeds. This assignment was consistent with the comparatively higher average electron density expected for Fe x O y relative to TiO 2 . The formation of permanent b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y bonding junctions was supported by the fact that the relative heterostructure configuration could withstand repeated postsynthesis purification cycles and that, whenever necessary, the HNCs could be sorted out from unreacted TiO 2 seeds and/or independently nucleated Fe x O y NCs upon careful nonsolvent destabilization combined with magnet attraction.</p><p>In line with earlier reports on other TiO 2 -Fe x O y systems, 19 monitoring of the reaction course confirmed that the heterostructures originated through direct deposition of Fe x O y patches onto the TiO 2 seeds, followed by gradual enlargement of such domains over time, during which the percentage of heterostructures within the total particle population maintained invariant. Accordingly, as the seeds basically dictated the number of Fe x O y nuclei generated, a reduction in the nominal NR content in the flask led to HNCs that carried proportionally larger Fe x O y heads with sizes ranging from ∼4 to ∼10 nm (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>After the fast-injection step, slow controlled-rate supply of proportionally larger volumes of the secondary Fe(CO) 5 :OLAC precursor feedstock solution afforded selective enlargement of the Fe x O y head dimensions up to ∼40 nm, along which the projected heterostructure profile could accordingly vary from matchstick-type (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-d</ref>) to mushroom-like (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e-g</ref>). It is notable that the one-sided Fe x O y growth mode regime was safely maintained in seeded syntheses, which exploited similarly tapered NRs with diameter and length dimensions spanning size intervals as wide as ∼3-10 nm and ∼25-70 nm, respectively. On the other hand, when the reactants were replenished by reiterating fast single-shot additions (even at sufficiently large time intervals in between consecutive injections), the samples could be detrimentally contaminated with independently generated Fe x O y NCs. Remarkably, HNCs consisting of multiply Fe x O y -decorated NRs were never observed under all synthesis conditions. Overall, our results demonstrated that the programmed reactant delivery technique, consisting of coupling a primary fast injection with cautiously calibrated secondary additions, guaranteed that growth of the Fe x O y domains initially implanted onto the NRs was strongly favored over both reiteration of heterogeneous nucleation events and parasitic homogeneous nucleation of free-standing Fe x O y NCs in the bulk medium. It is also worth remarking that these trends reflected well the typical dynamics of hindered nucleation and autocatalytic growth, which distinguishes Fe x O y formation by nonhydrolytic pathways. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Nonselective Growth on Exceedingly Large Seeds. The Fe x O y deposition mode entered a nonselective regime as the TiO 2 seeds far exceeded a certain size threshold. Heterostructure synthesis seeded with high aspect ratio tapered b-TiO 2 NRs with diameter/ length beyond ∼8/80 nm still yielded heterodimer HNCs, for which Fe x O y did not, however, show any localization preference (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h</ref>). Actually, the product comprised a mixture matchstick-shaped and various types of longitudinally decorated HNCs, as expected on a statistical basis from site-random Fe x O y nucleation. By comparison, it is useful to recall that analogous TiO 2 -Fe x O y heterostructures with uncontrolled architectural configurations were instead obtained as the exclusively accessible product when the seeding was accomplished with other types of crystal-phase-tailored and/or shaped TiO 2 seeds, regardless of their size. 19</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Topology Manipulation by Precursor Injection Modulation.</head><p>A deviation from the one-sided Fe x O y arrangement on the b-TiO 2 seeds was obtained by manipulating the kinetics of Fe x O y heterogeneous nucleation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> illustrates the effect of progressively decreasing the Fe(CO) 5 concentration of the primary feedstock solution (from 1 to about 0.1 M) employed in the primary fast-injection step under standard matchstickgenerating conditions at a fixed TiO 2 seed content. The corresponding reaction details are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Because of the increasingly restricted precursor supply, the nucleation onset was delayed and the Fe x O y domains eventually incorporated in the resulting binary HNCs could grow to proportionally smaller sizes (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>). Interestingly, a topological transition from a tip-selective to a fully nonspecific deposition regime <ref type="bibr">1c,d,19</ref> was appreciable, while HNC yield maintained invariant. The progression toward the new growth mode manifested through a gradual change in the relative abundance of matchstick-like HNCs within the particle population in favor of other heterostructure geometries, whereby the Fe x O y domains could be accommodated at any relative position along the longitudinal sidewalls of the respective NR sections (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>). Such a trend implied that a reduction in the nominal precursor to seed molar ratio caused a proportionally reduced probability of Fe x O y deposition at the NR extremities, being compensated for by a correspondingly higher degree of heterogeneous nucleation at other surface sites.</p><p>A statistical evaluation of the relevant TEM overviews indicated that Fe x O y domain size distribution converted from a monomodal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>) to a quasi-bimodal type for moderately low Fe(CO) 5 loadings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>). In the bimodal samples, the larger Fe x O y domains were mainly found on the apexes, while the smaller ones most frequently decorated the longitudinal sidewalls of the NRs. These findings suggested that these two HNC subfamilies were formed separately in time, with the deposition at the NR tips occurring somewhat faster than at other seed sites. On the other side, a renewed convergence toward a monomodal type Fe x O y size distribution was achieved upon excessive reduction of the Fe(CO) 5 amount added (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5d</ref>), ) 100 nm). The relevant reaction parameters are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>which accordingly reflected vanishing of the seed-site dependence of Fe x O y heterogeneous nucleation rate otherwise observed at intermediate precursor loadings. Regardless of the HNC configurations initially attained, supplemental precursor feedstock delivery subsequent to the primary fast-injection step allowed selective enlargement of the previously implanted Fe x O y domains and promoted moderate focusing of their size distribution without altering the pristine distributions of the heterostructure topological arrangement (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d-f</ref>).</p><p>To further clarify the mechanism underlying the topology switching, we examined the influence of altering other reaction parameters on the evolution of HNC configuration. In general, for fixed amount of Fe(CO) 5 injected, the progressive loss of the tip-preferential Fe x O y deposition mode was found to be accentuated with increasing NR concentration in the flask. As opposed, at extremely low TiO 2 content, matchstick-like HNCs represented the dominant product, although the particle population could be contaminated by homogeneously nucleated Fe x O y NCs to an extent that depended on the relative Fe(CO) 5 excess. On the other side, variations in the absolute surfactant content by a factor of ∼2 to ∼6 (as done for the precursor amount in the injection-modulated synthesis) at a fixed TiO 2 /Fe(CO) 5 ratio did not impact on the expected synthesis outcome to any significant extent. Again, in no circumstances were multiply Fe x O y -decorated NRs formed.</p><p>While confirming the self-catalytic nature of Fe x O y growth stage in our seeded environment, 33 all experimental proofs reported above suggest that the site-selective Fe x O y deposition on the seed should be a process kinetically regulated by the reactive monomer flux that sets in after the primary fast precursor injection step, depending on the relative Fe(CO) 5 to b-TiO 2 proportions realized. On the other hand, it also appears clear that the mechanism underlying spatially controlled heterogeneous nucleation greatly profits from exploitation of specifically sized and shape-tapered b-TiO 2 NRs as seeds in order to operate effectively. The necessity of subtle structural prerequisites that the seed should meet to allow for topology selection is highlighted by the outcome of seeded-growth syntheses accomplished with other types of crystal-phase tailored and/or shaped TiO 2 NRs, from which TiO 2 /Fe x O y HNCs with random configurations could be exclusively obtained, regardless of the seed size and of precursor supply conditions.  <ref type="formula">220</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">311</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">400</ref>), (440), and (511) reflections, cannot be discriminated due to their crystallographic similarity and the inherently large line widths leading to strong overlapping of several reflections. Accordingly, Rietveld-based fits 28 of the patterns were satisfactory accomplished regardless of whether the samples were assumed to be composed of b-TiO 2 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 or b-TiO 2 /Fe 3 O 4 phase mixtures. Interestingly, in addition to confirming retention of the TiO 2 brookite structure of the NR seeds in final HNC product, calculation of refined lattice parameters evidenced that the b-TiO 2 unit cell volume had underdone an average compression of about 1% following Fe x O y deposition.</p><p>Phase-contrast HRTEM investigations provided detailed information on the structure of individual HNCs for different topological configurations. Various cases of b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y heterointerfaces were encountered, among which the most frequently observed are described in the following. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> reports representative HRTEM studies of matchstick-shaped HNCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref>,<ref type="figure">g</ref>,<ref type="figure">o</ref>). In agreement with the SR-XRD data, the FFT calculations of the corresponding images (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>, <ref type="figure">h</ref>,<ref type="figure">i</ref>, <ref type="figure">p</ref>,<ref type="figure">q</ref>) confirmed that the HNCs individually embodied one of the original [0,0,1]-elongated orthorhombic b-TiO 2 seed in their rodshaped tail section, while the spherical head located at one apex was a single-crystalline Fe x O y domain in the inverse spinel cubic phases of indistinguishable Fe 3 O 4 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 . <ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">33</ref> The FFT patterns of the two lattices were merged to determine the crystallographic relationships holding between them in the respective cases. The joint diffractograms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6d</ref>,l,r) clarify that distinct HNCs embody the two materials arranged in nonequivalent relative configurations. On a first approximation, the two domains were assumed to be separated by continuous sharp heterointerfaces (marked by yellow dotted lines in panels e,m,s). The latter were inferred to be almost or fully parallel to those sets of b-TiO 2 facets that have been identified at the apexes of the starting seeds (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). For example, for the specific cases addressed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>, the orientations of the boundary junctions actually coincide to those of the (0,0,1) TiO 2 , (2,-2,-1) TiO 2 , and (1,-1,-1) TiO 2 planes, respectively, which accordingly indicates Fe x O y preference to nucleate and grow thereon.</p><p>The conditions of planar epitaxy subsisting between the b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y lattices were determined and expressed in terms of interfacial atomic plane continuity, according to the Coincidence Site Lattice theory (CSLT). <ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">40</ref> The CSLT is used to explain the crystallographic relationships between two types of materials by identifying the degree of matching between points of the respective lattices, and the frequency at which this correspondenceoccursalongtherelevantgrainboundaries. <ref type="bibr">1,3,15,19a,39</ref> (39) Randle, V.    <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>respective heterointerfaces. The interfacial lattice misfit associated with the aforementioned heterostructure configurations can be calculated to be of about +7%, +4%, and -6%, where the signs "+" and "-" denote the direction of the deformation (i.e., expansion or contraction, respectively), which the b-TiO 2 structure should undergo to achieve perfect coincidence site lattice correspondence with Fe x O y .</p><p>For the sake of a comparative structural evaluation, HRTEM investigations were also performed on HNCs made of longitudinally Fe x O y -decorated b-TiO 2 NRs. Representative results are reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. Here, the relative orientation of the heterointerfaces was always found to be parallel to the c-axis of the NR seeds, which substantiated preservation of the seed structure along the process of Fe x O y overgrowth. Under the most commonly observed zone axes, the expression of epitaxial relationships on the basis of the CSLT argument evidenced a generally better lattice matching for these nonselective heterostructure configurations. For example, for the two HNCs illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>, the interfacial projections of the (1,-1,-1) TiO 2 planes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref>,e) and of the (0,0,2) TiO 2 planes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7g</ref>,m) correspond regularly to those of the (-1,3,1) Fe x O y and (1,3,1) Fe x O y planes, respectively. The deducible mismatch is of about 0.2% and 1.5% for the respective cases. Interestingly, we performed atomistic modeling 15 of the interface structure examined down different orientations, which revealed that the coherent attachment between the b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y domains could be attained at the cost of a much higher lattice mismatch along zone axes other than those captured experimentally. For example, the alternative heterostructure view offered by the model constructed for the HNC in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref>-f, following a 90°rotation around to the junction plane, demonstrates a misfit as high as ∼7% along the new visible interface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6</ref> in the Supporting Information). In general, as the actual b-TiO 2 / Fe x O y junction is built-up three-dimensionally, it is likely to involve different degrees of lattice matching, depending on the heterostructure orientation under which the relevant interface is concerned. This fact suggests that the overall misfit strain energy accumulated in the longitudinally Fe x O y -functionalized NRs may not diverge exceedingly from that tolerated by the asymmetrically Fe x O y -tipped NRs. Analogous deductions were previously reported for other prototypes of topologically selectable TiO 2 -based heterostructures. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> To better elucidate the bonding relationships and strain distribution in the heterostructures, changes in HRTEM contrast amplitude and fringe displacement across the HNCs were analyzed in detail, as previously done for the starting NR seeds (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>The spatial localization of b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y phase components within the heterostructures was first assessed by analyzing the local HRTEM contrast amplitude of periodicities distinctive of each crystal phase. <ref type="bibr">19a,29,35</ref> The as-derived crystal-phase maps disclosed the detailed topological distribution of the b-TiO 2 and spinel cubic Fe x O y components in the tail and head sections, respectively, which confirmed preservation of the size and shape of the seeds during Fe x O y deposition on their arrow-shaped terminations. The relative extent of fringe visibility attenuation recognizable along the b-TiO 2 portion resembles that indentified for the bare NRs as a consequence of their intrinsic bending (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). This fact indicates that Fe x O y overgrowth had not significantly altered the natural curvature of the seeds, as expected on the basis of the limited surface fraction occupied by the joint Fe x O y domains. On the other side, although a relatively more uniform HRTEM contrast generally characterizes the Fe x O y sections, the latter occasionally present an abrupt amplitude decrease over limited areas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6s</ref>,t and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a-f</ref>). Such fringe intensity changes may not necessarily be related to lattice distortion consequent to heterojunction formation. In fact, similar effects were also encountered in isolate Fe x O y NCs, whereby they could be ascribed to local alteration in the dynamical electron diffraction condition due, for instance, to a local tilt and/or variation in nanocrystal thickness.</p><p>The crystal-phase maps clarify that that the two domains actually shared interfaces of variable extensions, depending on whether the Fe x O y head was narrowly accommodated either on the small basal (001)-type sides (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6f</ref>), on the more developed higher-index oblique facets at the apex sections (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6n</ref>,t), or on the longitudinal sidewalls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7f</ref>,<ref type="figure">n</ref>). This is qualitatively consistent with the extent of interfacial strain experienced by the two materials in the respective cases, according to which proportionally smaller contact areas corresponded to higher degrees of lattice mismatch at the relevant junctions. Here, it should, however, be noted that the apparent irregularities that characterize the interface boundaries, such as local abrupt change in their running directions or extended curvature, are topologically meaningless, because they are affected by fringe delocalization effects and strongly depend on the defocus value at which the experimental images are recorded (as demonstrated by pertinent HRTEM simulations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S7</ref> of the Supporting Information).</p><p>The application of the GPA approach <ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[31]</ref> to probe lattice fringe displacement and rotation provided interesting information on the evolution of strain in the b-TiO 2 NRs following heterostructure formation. The representative GPA analyses of matchstick-like and longitudinally functionalized HNCs addressed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6u</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7o</ref>, respectively, suggest some major differences in strain component distribution, as compared to those found for the bare NRs. On one side, the R xy maps confirm a steady lattice fringe rotation along the NR section, which is ascribable to the obvious nanostructure curvature. On the other side, the D yy map highlights emergence of significant b-TiO 2 lattice deformation in proximity to the attached Fe x O y domain. In particular, the fringes running orthogonal to the</p><p>Table 2. Reaction Parameters Used in the Synthesis of the HNCs Shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> sample correspondence with images in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref> panel c-axis exhibit a sudden spacing contraction of 7-8% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6u</ref>) or expansion of ∼4-5% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7o</ref>) as they approach and span a NR portion that extends a few square nanometers far ahead of the area shadowed by the Fe x O y domain. Across the deformed NR region, being approximately twice as extended as the seed area in front of Fe x O y , the degree of strain maintains approximately constant, while it steeply declines elsewhere (see the corresponding strain profiles in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S8</ref> of the Supporting Information). Within the limits of our HRTEM investigations (∼50 objects examined for each topology), the strain signature appeared to be more pronounced for the matchstick HNCs (7-8%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6u</ref>) than for their longitudinally decorated counterpart (4-5%, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7o</ref>). In this respect, it is worth stressing that HRTEM and SR-XRD do not provide contradictory results regarding the extent of lattice strain in the HNCs. Indeed, the GPA treatment of HRTEM images decoupled strain in individual heterostructures, where lattice deformation was spatially confined to a fraction (20-40%) of the overall NR domain volume. Differently, the SR-XRD data embodied structural information collected on a highly statistically meaningful basis, the analysis of which provided an estimation of average strain degree, which was consistently much lower (∼1%) than the one derived from GPA-HRTEM.</p><p>As for what regards the HNC in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7o</ref>, some additional aspects deserve remark. For example, it can be noticed that the maximum percentage degree of strain inferred in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7o</ref> (cf., D xx and D yy maps) largely fails to approach the interfacial lattice mismatch value deduced on the basis of the CSLT, which has been in fact estimated to be almost negligible (0.1%, cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7e</ref> and <ref type="figure">o</ref>). This discrepancy can be explained by considering that the CSLT treatment provides a measure of the in-plane lattice fit by evaluating the interfacial correspondence of the atomic plane spacings of the corresponding bulk materials for the particular heterostructure geometry concerned. Thus, CSLTestimated misfit describes a deformation that develops only across the plane on which the heterostructure lies. <ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">40</ref> Differently, the topological variation of lattice strain in the GPA map can be expected to reflect, although indirectly, extra deformation effects induced by highly detrimental interfacial lattice mismatch conditions holding along other out-of-plane crystallographic directions. Our interface structure models indeed confirmed that such circumstances actually subsisted for the HNC studied in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7a</ref>-f (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6</ref> in the Supporting Information).</p><p>Additional interesting structural details can be inferred on comparing the D xx and D yy maps in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7o</ref>. It emerges that the deformation developing in the y direction, that is, along the c-axis of the NR section, is comparatively much higher than the one developing along the perpendicular x direction. Furthermore, it can be appreciated that the strain signature appears to be especially concentrated at the edges of the interface while propagating far beyond. Simplified finite-element calculations of the elastic response of a TiO 2 NR joint to Fe x O y particle supported the hypothesis that the features highlighted above could possibly originate from the inherent anisotropic deformability of the orthorhombic b-TiO 2 lattice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S9</ref> in the Supporting Information), as suggested by recent mechanical studies. <ref type="bibr">41</ref> In all cases investigated by us, the general observation that the lattice fringe displacement involves a relatively large portion of the b-TiO 2 seed, which extends far beyond the b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y junction region, while being attenuated only at a significant distance from it, points out that the b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y interfacial mismatch should be the main source of lattice strain in these heterostructures. The absence of interface dislocations suggests operation of mechanisms of strain propagation proceeding through long-range elastic transmission rather than via plastic relaxation. 40 3.4. Iron Oxide Phase Composition. XANES measurements were performed to examine the average oxidation state of Fe in the samples and, hence, to discriminate between Fe 3 O 4 and γ-Fe 2 O 3 phases. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> displays the XANES spectra at the Fe K-edge of matchstick-shaped HNCs made of ∼5 nm × ∼60 nm b-TiO 2 NRs tipped with Fe x O y domains of ∼6, ∼15, and ∼17 nm, respectively. XANES at the K-edge of transition metals in oxides originates from the excitation of a 1s photoelectron into p-type states. A pre-edge peak may occur due to 1s to 3d transitions with 3d-4p mixing, which involve cations in noncentrosymmetric positions. <ref type="bibr">42,43a</ref> In the case of spinel Fe x O y (γ-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 ), a prominent pre-edge peak, located at around 7110 eV, correlates with Fe cations in octahedral positions. Therefore, judging from the characteristic pre-edge features and their relative intensity with respect to the white line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>, the HNC samples can be concluded to contain spinel Fe x O y , in agreement with SR-XRD measurements. The presence of other minority phases, such as rhombohedral γ-Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) and FeO (wu ¨stite), can be safely ruled out, because the 1s to 3d transitions are known to be very weak for the former and forbidden for the latter. <ref type="bibr">42,43a</ref> In addition, it can be noted that the spectra of the HNCs tipped with the ∼6 and ∼17 nm are very similar, while significantly differing from the spectrum of the heterostructures functionalized with ∼15 nm Fe x O y heads, which in fact exhibits an absorption edge shifted by about 2 eV toward lower energies, a white line with reduced amplitude and sharpness, a shoulder at 7145 eV, and a more intense pre-edge peak. By comparison with the "fingerprints" of the reference compounds, the spectral details suggest that the former two samples should be in a more oxidized state closer to that of γ-Fe 2 O 3 , while both Fe 3 O 4 and γ-Fe 2 O 3 phases should coexist in the latter. <ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">43</ref> The relative Fe 3 O 4 to γ-Fe 2 O 3 fractions were estimated by fitting the sample spectra to a weighted sum of the spectra of the corresponding bulk material references (note that this approach is limited by the fact XANES profiles of nanoscale samples can severely diverge from those of their bulk counterparts due to surface effects; 43a therefore, the phase percentage estimations cannot be more accurate than (5-8%). The relative γ-Fe 2 O 3 :Fe 3 O 4 content was derived to be of about 80%:20% for the HNCs tipped with ∼6 and ∼17 nm Fe x O y domains, and of 30%:70% for HNCs beating ∼15 nm Fe x O y heads, respectively. According to previous Mo ¨ssbauer spectroscopy investigations, Fe x O y domains smaller than ∼11 nm grown on anatase TiO 2 NRs by an analogous nonhydrolytic route were also found to consist mainly of γ-Fe 2 O 3 . <ref type="bibr">19a</ref> The nonmonotonic sizedependence of the spinel phase composition found here is not unexpected, given that the mechanisms leading to Fe x O y formation depend not only on the specific chemical route exploited, but also on the structural quality of the Fe x O y NCs that are eventually subjected to oxidation, as well as on the particular oxidant species eventually involved. <ref type="bibr">33,42b</ref> 3.5. Magnetic Characterization. SQUID magnetometry was used to investigate the magnetic properties associated with the Fe x O y component of the nanoheterostructures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref> summarizes the characterization results for various samples of matchstick-shaped HNCs grown from the same b-TiO 2 NRs (∼5 nm/∼50 nm) and carrying Fe x O y domains with average sizes of about 6.1 ( 1.2, 8.1 ( 1.2, 9.9 ( 1.3, 15.6 ( 1.9, and 17.0 ( 2.3 nm (note that the diamagnetic contribution of TiO 2 , measured independently, was negligible). The temperaturedependent magnetization (M) curves recorded after zero-field cooling (ZFC) were generally rather large, tending to broaden with increasing Fe x O y head size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9a</ref>). The ZFC maxima, corresponding to the average blocking temperature (T B ), exhibited a general tendency to increase with the Fe x O y size. In particular, the T B values lay in between 40 and 150 K for Fe x O y domains smaller than ∼10 nm, whereas they abruptly jumped to above 250 K for HNCs carrying Fe x O y domains larger than ∼12-15 nm. Minor deviations from this behavior were found for samples of HNCs bearing Fe x O y with nominally similar sizes, which preliminarily suggested that the size-dependence of T B could be additionally modulated by the existence of b-TiO 2 / Fe x O y bonding interfaces with different structure and extension. This hypothesis was further corroborated by the observation that HNCs generally exhibited a sharper temperature-dependence of M, hence a narrower distribution of energy barrier for M reversal, relative to their NR/Fe x O y NC physical mixture counterparts. The latter exhibited a behavior resembling that of pure Fe x O y NCs 33b,c,42b,44 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S10</ref> in the Supporting Information).</p><p>The field-dependence of the magnetization coherently confirmed the ZFC data. Indeed, the magnetization curves recorded at room temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9b</ref>) for HNCs equipped with smaller Fe x O y heads (below ∼10 nm) followed the Langevin function, authenticating a superparamagnetic behavior. On the contrary, the magnetization curves of HNCs carrying much larger Fe x O y domains exhibited coercive fields, H C , of the order of 20-40 Oe and remanence, M R , of about 1 emu/g, demonstrating that a fraction of the HNCs was blocked already at room temperature.</p><p>At 5 K (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9c</ref>), the samples still displayed symmetric single-loop cycles with M reaching saturation even at moderate fields, which implied the absence of any appreciable fraction of a decoupled surface spinglass-like surface phase with higher magnetic anisotropy. <ref type="bibr">33b,c,42b,44</ref> The saturation magnetization, M S , values were rather spread (39.7 ( 0.5, 72.0 ( 0.5, 31.2 ( 0.5, 67.8 ( 0.5, and 59.2 ( 0.5 emu/g for HNCs tipped with increasingly larger Fe x O y heads, respectively), all falling below the values expected for bulk γ-Fe 2 O 3 (90 emu/g) and Fe 3 O 4 (80-84 emu/g). It is known that such M S reduction in nanoscale spinel ferrite material manifests magnetic disorder due to the  concurrence of various surface effects, among which a major role is played by canted and/or disordered spins associated with coordinatively unsaturated surface atoms, broken exchange bonds, and surface strain (the diamagnetic contribution of the bound surfactants can be safely considered insignificant). <ref type="bibr">33b-d,42b,44</ref> Notably, the M S values associated with the HNCs and their b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y physical mixture counterpart were 60-65% and 15-20% lower than M S measured for corresponding pure Fe x O y NCs, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S10</ref> in the Supporting Information). This evidence pointed to the existence of extra demagnetization effects related to the b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y interfaces in the HNCs, which could not be otherwise accounted for by changes in dipolar coupling 1c,15 or interfacial chemical reactions. <ref type="bibr">59</ref> Analogous to the M S behavior, the H C values at 5 K oscillated over a rather broad range (210 ( 15, 80 ( 15, 50 ( 15, 490 ( 15, and 330  ( 15 Oe, respectively), which could not be traced to any clear size-dependent trend, as opposed to what has generally been observed for isolated Fe x O y NCs. <ref type="bibr">33b-d,42b,44</ref> 3.6. Photocatalytic Properties. We examined the photocatalytic properties of our coupled semiconductor heterostructures with type-I band staggering, with respect to their ability to accumulate electrons under continuous UV irradiation at 365 nm and/or utilize stored charges for subsequent dark reactions. As a representative case of study, a comparative solution-phase examination of the behavior of b-TiO 2 NRs (with diameter/ length of ∼5 nm/∼50 nm) with respect to those exhibited by HNCs derived thereof (tipped with ∼10 nm Fe x O y heads) and by corresponding NR/Fe x O y NC physical mixtures is reported in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>. The pertinent energy diagram, constructed on the basis of the band gaps of the respective bulk materials (0.1, 2.3, and 3.4 eV for half-metallic Fe 3 O 4 , γ-Fe 2 O 3 , and b-TiO 2 , respectively), and the relevant photocatalytic processes are sketched in Scheme 1. The experiments were carried out in O 2 -free anhydrous organic solvents (mixtures of toluene/ chloroform and ethanol). In such media, the availability of photogenerated TiO 2 conduction-band electrons (e CB TiO 2 ) for reductive pathways is enhanced due to (i) insignificant scavenging of e CB TiO 2 and negligible • OH radical production due to the absence of dissolved atmospheric O 2 and H 2 O, respectively; and (ii) efficient scavenging of valence-band holes (h VB TiO 2 ) by the solvent (in particular, by ethanol). <ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">45</ref> On the basis of a wealth of previous aqueous-phase studies, <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">46</ref> the photocatalytic activity of Fe x O y can be assumed to be irrelevant with respect to that of TiO 2 . Therefore, mainly the TiO 2 component is expected to exploit UV light for chemical reactions. <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">46</ref> Our surfactant-capped nanostructured photocatalysts maintained fully soluble and stable, even after prolonged irradiation, due to negligible oxidative degradation of their capping ligands. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">47</ref> The high optical transparency of the colloidal systems allowed direct spectrophotometric monitoring of the course of photocatalytic reactions (e.g., related to carrier transfer to target acceptors and/ or catalyst modification) that had a signature in the UV/vis/ near-IR spectral range, without the complication of separating the catalysts from solution species. <ref type="bibr">32a,47</ref> The photochromic response of the samples is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>. The initial NR solutions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10a</ref>, red curve) exhibited the typical TiO 2 exciton absorption below 380-370 nm, 23 while the TiO 2 /Fe x O y -contaning samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10a</ref>, green and blue curves) were dominated by the strong Fe x O y absorption extending from the UV-vis to the near-IR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10a</ref>, black curve), which originates from ligand-to-metal chargetransfer transitions, magnetic-coupled Fe 3+ ligand field transitions, and pair excitations. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> The non-negligible absorption in the near-IR region beyond 700 nm, which is absent in γ-Fe 2 O 3 , suggested the presence of the less oxidized Fe 3 O 4 phase. <ref type="bibr">45</ref> The irradiation experiments realized simultaneous band gap photoexcitation of Fe x O y and TiO 2 components. As a result of efficient h VB TiO 2 scavenging by the solvent molecules (Scheme 1, part I), continuous UV-photoexcitation of the b-TiO 2 NRs resulted in a net accumulation of e CB TiO 2 at Ti(IV) centers. <ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">48</ref> This phenomenon was marked by the emergence of a distinguishable featureless absorption in the visible to near-IR range (λ &gt; ∼400 nm, blue coloration), which reached saturation in 1-3 h, depending on the TiO 2 concentration and on the solvent composition. The difference spectra allow clear visualization of the net changes achieved (Figure 10b, red curve). The e CB TiO 2</p><p>storage on b-TiO 2 NRs was confirmed to be a fully reversible process. Actually, the blue coloration vanished either very slowly (over several hours) if the stored e CB TiO 2 were allowed to discharge into the solution under nitrogen or almost instantly if air (hence O 2 ) was admitted to the vessel. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> In the case of the HNCs and TiO 2 /Fe x O y mixtures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10b</ref>, blue and green curves), photochromic changes were also appreciable, which however took place more slowly (in 3-4 h irradiation) and were distinguished by some major features at saturation. First, the absorbance developing at λ &gt; 500 nm was proportionally less pronounced, according to the order: HNCs &lt; b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y mixture &lt; TiO 2 , with slope variation being evident at λ &gt; 700 nm. No such absorption was detected for isolated Fe x O y NCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10b</ref>, black curve). Second, a significant bleaching emerged at λ &lt; 500, not otherwise detected for b-TiO 2 , which appeared to be less accentuated for bare Fe x O y NCs. Complementary investigations, supported by TEM moni-  <ref type="figure">d-f</ref>) in O 2 -free conditions. The spectra were taken using the irradiated photocatalyst solution as the reference (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10b</ref>) and were corrected by the relevant dilution factor. Conditions: [TiO 2 ] ) 0.72 mM, [Fe 2 O 3 ] ) 0.74 mM; preirradiation time ) 60 min (note that the small kinks detectable at 800 nm in some cases are artifacts due to light source switching in the spectrophotometer).</p><p>toring of the Fe x O y size evolution and ICP-AES analysis of the Fe content in the solution, indicated that Fe x O y was not affected by any noticeable photodissolution, a drawback that has instead been frequently encountered for Fe x O y photocatalysis in aqueous media, especially in the presence of Fe-ion chelating agents, h VB Fe x O y scavengers, and/or in case of direct Fe x O y interfacing with TiO 2 . <ref type="bibr">20a,25</ref> The low solubility of Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ions in the relatively nonpolar media used here could be responsible for the observed Fe x O y resistance against photocorrosion. Notably, the photoinduced spectral changes relative to the binary photocatalysts were not fully reversible upon air admission to the vessel and displayed further (though much slower) evolution even under inert atmosphere in the dark, suggesting that the preirradiated Fe x O y component had become reactive toward the solvent molecule (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S11</ref> in the Supporting Information). On the basis of these experimental proofs, the spectral changes at λ &gt; 500 nm could be provisionally interpreted (Scheme 1, part III) as arising partly from the effect of excess e CB TiO 2 stored on b-TiO 2 and partly from alterations in the electronic structure, stoichiometry, and/or average degree of oxidation of the Fe x O y component induced by b-TiO 2 carrier injection (for example, a γ-Fe 2 O 3 phase enrichment could lead to absorption changes, especially in the red/near-IR region 45 ). Changes in Fe x O y electronic structure could be invoked to account for the bleaching at λ &gt; 500 nm, the extent of which indeed appeared to be dictated by the interaction of Fe x O y with photoexcited TiO 2 45 (cf., black and green/blue curves in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10b</ref>). To clarify the origin of the photoinduced spectral changes, we verified the feasibility of extracting the photoinduced excess of electrons trapped on the preirradiated samples and using them for subsequent reduction reactions in the dark. To probe electron transfer, we used an organic antrachinonic dye, UBA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> in the Supporting Information), which can be reduced to its hydroantraquinonic form, UBA red (+0.1 &lt; E UBA/UBA red 0 ≈ 0.1÷0.154 V vs NHE at pH ) 7), <ref type="bibr">32a,50</ref> and fullerene (C 60 ), the latter being capable of multielectron reduction (E 0 C60/C60 • -) -0.25 V vs NHE for the one-electron C 60 reduction to C 60</p></div>

Assuming that the literature redox potential scale, measured for aqueous media, is valid for our system, 32,47 the energetics is favorable to e CB TiO 2 transfer to both acceptors, because the TiO 2 conduction-band edge is more negative (E CB TiO 2 ) -0.5 V vs NHE at pH ) 7). On the other side, the position of the conduction-band edge of nanosized spinel cubic Fe x O y (E CB Fe x O y ) is uncertain, <ref type="bibr">20,21,24,25,45a,46,49,52</ref> being expected to be located several tens of meV below E CB TiO 2 . It can therefore be anticipated that the potential of Fe x O y conduction-band electrons (e CB Fe x O y ) eventually available may not be low enough to reduce both acceptors considered here (Scheme 1, parts II, IV).</p><p>Electron titration experiments were performed under nitrogen by injecting known acceptor amounts into the UV-irradiated nanostructure solution and recording the differential spectrum after each addition against the UV-irradiated solution as the reference. In the UBA-based titrations, the emergence of new features at ∼380, ∼400, ∼435, and ∼465 nm, along with the disappearance of the double band of unreduced UBA (peaking at 588 and 625 nm), mark the formation of UBA red . <ref type="bibr">32a</ref> In the case of C 60 -based titrations, the generation of C 60</p><p>•is recognizable by the growth of an extra narrow band with maxima at 1140-1150 nm and absorption bleaching at 1180-1185 nm, which add to the spectral features of unreduced C 60 (at ∼408, ∼540, and ∼600 nm). <ref type="bibr">32b,c,51</ref> The titration results are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11</ref>. In the case of preirradiated TiO 2 NR sample, electron uptake by the acceptor was accompanied by a proportional absorption dampening in the visible-to-near-IR region, which confirmed the existence of a photoinduced excess of e CB TiO 2 trapped on TiO 2 and their prompt utilization in the reduction reaction. In particular, UBA allowed quantitative extraction of the extra e CB TiO 2 stored to produce stoichiometric amounts of UBA red . <ref type="bibr">32a</ref> Indeed, the titration end point, marked by the appearance of the double band of unreduced UBA (peaking at 588 and 625 nm), corresponded to full abatement of the visible-to-near-IR absorption that had grown in the UV-irradiation step (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11a</ref>). Differently, an incomplete abatement of the visible-to-near-IR absorbance (∼80%) was observed in the C 60 -based titration, as the C 60 /C 60 •redox couple attained equilibrium with residual e CB TiO 2 resident within TiO 2 for relatively large C 60 amounts added 51 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11d</ref>).</p><p>Interesting pieces of information were gathered from the titrations of the Fe x O y -containing samples. The C 60 -based titrations highlighted that the C 60</p><p>•yield, judged from the net absorbance excursion associated with the local maxima at 1140-1150 nm, was little affected by the presence of the Fe x O y component (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10e</ref>,<ref type="figure">f</ref>). In contrast, the UBA red yields attained using preirradiated physical mixtures and HNCs were found to be, respectively, ∼85% and ∼95% lower than that achieved with TiO 2 only (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>). This trend was indirectly confirmed by the relative rate of steady-state photocatalytic UBA demolition reported when coexisting photocatalyst/dye solutions were subjected to continuous UV illumination <ref type="bibr">50a,b</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S12</ref> in the Supporting Information). By comparison, insignificant acceptor reduction took place with the sole preirradiated Fe x O y NCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref> in the Supporting Information).</p><p>In addition to the finding above, some sets of spectral details are worthy to be highlighted. First, the ultimate absorbance abatement recorded in the red to near-IR range (λ &gt; 650 nm) along the titration course far exceeded the extent needed to cancel out the positive absorbance gained in the preirradiation step (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>, <ref type="figure">e</ref>,<ref type="figure">f</ref>). In the particular case of C 60 , control dark experiments with the sole Fe x O y NCs showed that these spectral changes were mostly due to C 60 interacting with Fe x O y surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14</ref> in the Supporting Information). Second, the titration led to an extra deep absorbance bleaching at λ &lt; 500 nm (large enough to overwhelm the spectral signature of reduced acceptor), the features and extent of which depended on the specific photocatalyst concerned. No such extra dampening could be detected for blank experiments in which acceptors were added to either irradiated TiO 2 NRs or unirradiated TiO 2 /Fe x O y samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14</ref> in the Supporting Information).</p><p>On the basis of all of the experimental findings above, some major deductions can be drawn. The large discrepancies between the reducing capabilities of the preirradiated HNCs and Fe x O y / TiO 2 mixture toward the two selected acceptors, relative to the corresponding performances reported with the bare TiO 2 NRs, suggested that the visible-to-near-IR absorbance attained for the binary photocatalysts under UV irradiation did not merely reflect the extent of the photoinduced e CB TiO 2 reservoir resident in the TiO 2 component. If this had been the case, proportionally smaller reduction yields should have been recorded when using both C 60 and UBA probes, because e CB TiO 2 had in fact been proven to be capable of reducing both species (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">11a</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>). Therefore, it should be inferred that, in addition to e CB TiO 2 stored within TiO 2 , some other species acted as selective reducing agents (i.e., capable to drive further reduction of C 60 only) in the preirradiated composite photocatalysts. The known redox properties of spinel cubic iron oxides suggest that such species could reasonably be the pristine Fe x O y domains in a reduced Fe 3 O 4rich form. <ref type="bibr">21a-e,24,25,32,45a,46,49</ref> Assuming no relevant kinetic barrier for electron release from these UV-reconstructed "magnetite-like" domains, the latter should be assigned a redox potential E CB Fe x O y (or, equally, the potential for the γ-</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Fe 2 O 3 / Fe 3 O 4 redox couple, E γ-Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 0 ) lying somewhere below E 0 C 60 /C60 • -(Scheme 1, parts II, IV).</formula><p>Finally, the emergence of spectral features that were not correlated with acceptor reduction suggested that the optical properties of UV-activated Fe 3 O 4like sections could be strongly affected by adsorption of the acceptor molecules and/or their reduced counterparts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Growth Mechanism of HNCs.</head><p>The present work has demonstrated a colloidal approach for the topologically controlled synthesis of magnetic-semiconductor all-oxide HNCs in an exclusive heterodimer configuration. The newly developed heteronanostructures are individually composed of one rod-like orthorhombic-phase b-TiO 2 section, on which a single nearly spherical cubic-phase Fe x O y domain is located either at one apex or at any location along the longitudinal sidewalls. The protocol devised here permits the high-yield preparation of HNCs in specific architectural configurations with the dimensions of constituent material sections being independently tunable over a broad size range by adjustment of a few reaction parameters.</p><p>The controllable liquid-phase preparation of surfactantstabilized heteronanostructures with asymmetric distribution of their constituent domains requires achieving independent control over the fundamental nucleation and growth processes underlying formation of the individual material components, on one side, and operation of suitable anisotropic reaction pathways to allow for topology selection, on the other side. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> To realize these goals for the present b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y system, we have implemented a seed-mediated strategy through which Fe x O y formation by a nonhydrolytic route can be governed by means of preformed b-TiO 2 NRs in the reaction environment. Within the frame of this scheme, the potential for generating binary b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y HNCs with simultaneously selectable topologies and geometric parameters arises from the combination of two major conditions: first, the use of specifically shape-tapered b-TiO 2 NRs equipped with structurally dissimilar apexes, which can potentially act as anisotropically reactive seeding substrates; second, promotion of a kinetically driven Fe x O y deposition regime, in which the anisotropic reactivity of the seeds can be accentuated so as to guarantee their controllable site-selective accessibility beyond growth limitations imposed by interfacial strain. In the following, these issues will be discussed within the frame of different models offering complementary mechanistic views of HNC formation.</p><p>A CNT Interpretation. The time evolution of HNC topology indicates that foreign b-TiO 2 NRs present in Fe x O y -generating media act as primary nucleation centers onto which Fe x O y is selectively deposited. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> This mechanism is founded on a basic principle of the classical nucleation theory (CNT), according to which the energy barrier, ∆G het * , that has to be surpassed for a given material to nucleate heterogeneously onto a preformed condensed phase (seeds) is lower than the activation energy, ∆G hom * , required to induce corresponding homogeneous nucleation of separate crystal embryos: <ref type="bibr">1,34b,37b</ref> where the "wetting" function, 0 &lt; f(θ) &lt; 1, depends on the particular system geometry (e.g., size/shape of the substrate seed and of the material domain "droplet" deposited thereon) and on the interfacial tension equilibrium attained at the threeboundary seed/"droplet"/solution region. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> In an equivalent way, heterogeneous nucleation can be described as requiring a much lower chemical potential of solution monomers to be triggered, relative to homogeneous nucleation: 34b</p><p>The limiting case of complete "wetting", in which the depositing "droplet" has full affinity to the substrate (i.e., the foreign "droplet" and the substrate are made of the same material), corresponds to the process of seed growth. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> The latter involves a proportionally negligible barrier, ∆G growth * (∆G growth * , ∆G het * &lt; ∆G hom * ), and can accordingly be sustained by much lower supersaturation levels (∆µ growth , ∆µ het &lt; ∆µ hom ).</p><p>The synthesis of the present TiO 2 -Fe x O y HNCs has been based on coupling a seeding step with a particular Fe x O ygenerating route that meets nucleation-growth kinetic requirements suitable to realize the potential of the seeded growth approach. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> We have exploited the thermal treatment of Fe(CO) 5 in a complex OLAM/OLAC/DDIOL mixture, whereby various nonhydrolytic pathways, such as direct pyrolysis of in situ formed iron oleate and/or amino iron complexes and aminolysis/ alcoholysis of iron oleate, can yield different Fe and Fe x O y phases, depending on the reaction conditions. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Our experiments were performed at moderate temperature without addition of extra oxidizers, which guaranteed selective production of inverse spinel Fe 3 O 4 /γ-Fe 2 O 3 , as proven by combined SR-XRD, HRTEM, and XANES investigations (Figures 2, 6-8). Fe x O y formation in these nonaqueous surfactant systems involves a distinctive reaction dynamics arising from the dissimilar dependence of the nucleation and growth processes on temperature and on the solution supersaturation degree, respectively. <ref type="bibr">33a,b,d</ref> In the absence of foreign seeds, homogeneous nucleation is a highly hindered process that can be considerably delayed with respect to the nominal precursor injection step until a sufficiently high concentration of secondary molecular species has ac-cumulated in the solution. <ref type="bibr">33a,d</ref> It manifests as a sudden burstlike event that self-terminates as the monomer supersaturation is quickly relieved below the critical level required to surpass the huge ∆G hom *Fe x O y barrier. On the other hand, once embryos have been formed, their further growth proceeds autocatalytically (∆G growth *Fe x O y , ∆G hom *Fe x O y ) in a diffusion-controlled regime leading to fast volume increase and size focusing. <ref type="bibr">33b,d</ref> The formation of HNCs can be rationalized within the frame of the above-described nucleation-growth dynamics as it is "perturbed" by the presence of preformed seeds. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> Selective Fe x O y deposition onto foreign b-TiO 2 NRs is ensured by an initial fast iron precursor injection that induces a slow increase in the monomer chemical potential up to the modest level ∆µ het Fe x O y required for narrowly overcoming the low ∆G het *Fe x O y barrier. During this stage, the Fe x O y monomers are swiftly consumed, and further depletion occurs during subsequent autocatalytic Fe x O y growth. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Parasitic homogeneous nucleation is eluded because it needs a much higher solution supersaturation level to earn the energy surplus necessary to surpass ∆G hom *Fe x O y (eq 2). A relatively broad size variance generally characterizes the Fe x O y domains of the as-borne HNCs at the early development stages, depending on the absolute precursor to seed ratio realized in the primary injection (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). This fact suggests that both the apex-confined surface regions and longitudinal sidewalls of the NRs should accommodate a distribution of differently reactive sites, <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">54</ref> actually reflecting the rich seed faceting evidenced by HRTEM (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Irregularities in surface atomic arrangement, defects, corners, edges, and/or regions of imperfect surfactant passivation are likely to act as primary catalytic centers capable of triggering the deposition process. The drop in supersaturation level caused by fast monomer consumption during the early reaction stages can explain why heterogeneous nucleation could not be reiterated after the primary event. In addition, it is conceivable that the concomitant buildup of an electric polarization region at the newly formed b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y interface could adversely alter the charge distribution across the seed so as to drive exclusive growth of the primarily implanted Fe x O y domain rather than initiating deposition at additional seed locations. <ref type="bibr">6,17c,19</ref> Both effects can explain why HNCs are ultimately composed of a single Fe x O y domain accommodated on each b-TiO 2 NR over a wide range of synthesis conditions. This picture justifies the technique of replenishing the Fe x O y monomer availability by means of slow supplementary reactant additions, which conveniently served to propel selective enlargement of the Fe x O y sections to extremely large sizes (∼40 nm), while permitting narrowing of their size distribution.</p><p>Overall, the above-described dynamics, whereby the b-TiO 2 seeds regulate the relative extent of Fe x O y monomer consumption between a kinetically hindered heterogeneous nucleation phase and a self-catalyzed growth stage, accounts for the high yield with which binary HNCs can be obtained in exclusive heterodimer configuration with independently size-tunable component material sections.</p><p>A Thermodynamic Description. In a more accurate thermodynamic description, the Fe x O y "wetting" condition on b-TiO 2 can be expressed by evaluating the sign of total free surface energy change, ∆G S , that accompanies heterogeneous deposition, in close analogy with the description of thin-film hetero-(53) The universal relation holding between ∆G het * and ∆G hom * (eq 1) has been clarified within the frame of simplified models (see refs 34b, 37b), in which a "nucleus" of a secondary material (Fe x O y in the present case) heterogeneously deposited on a pre-existent seed (b-TiO 2 in our case) is regarded as a "droplet" that has condensed thereon, forming a contact angle, θ, with the substrate underneath: ∆G het * ) f(θ)∆G hom * , where the wetting function, f(θ), that defines the degree of "wetting" achievable is 0 &lt; f(θ) &lt; 1, and depends on the particular system geometry (e.g., shape of the substrate and of the droplet) and on the interfacial tension equilibrium attained at the three-boundary TiO</p><p>2 / Fe x O y /solution region according to the Young's relation: σ TiO 2 ) σ Fe x O y *cos θ + σ TiO 2 /Fe x O y , where σ TiO 2 and σ Fe x O y are the specific solid/ solution tensions associated with the two materials, and σ TiO 2 /Fe x O y is the specific solid/solid TiO 2 /Fe x O y tension. Note that the barrier for nuclei growth, ∆G growth *, is far smaller than both ∆G hom * and ∆G het * and corresponds to the limiting case of complete wetting (f(θ) f 0 for θ f 0).

The former two terms can be expected to be affected by adhesion of solution species, while the latter depends on the bonding strength and lattice mismatch. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> The structural-topological complexity of the present heterostructures does not allow identification of a unique "wetting" regime, because the starting substrate seeds expose various sets of facets with different extension, which can covered by Fe x O y either completely (∆G S &gt; 0), that is, at the NR apexes, or partially (∆G S &lt; 0), that is, at the longitudinal sidewalls. The nonnegligible interfacial strain should play important roles in driving Fe x O y to segregate into discrete spherical domains rather than ubiquitously covering the whole seed surface. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr">[19]</ref> The success of our seeded syntheses indicates that the formation of HNCs is energetically favorable under our reaction conditions, because it permits the total free surface energy to be lowered below the value that would otherwise characterize a solution mixture of NRs and homogeneously nucleated tiny Fe x O y clusters. The expected energy gain can be understood as arising from a compensation mechanism by which the surface and interfacial energy terms balance with each other. On a first approximation, it can be assumed that the surface energy cost associated with Fe x O y deposition, γ Fe x O y , is little dependent on the HNC topology provided that the Fe x O y and b-TiO 2 sections share comparable interfacial areas. Therefore, Fe x O y nucleation at the NR tips can be regarded as a process that conveniently eliminates the smallest unstable b-TiO 2 facets thereon (cf., Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). This would lead to a significant γ TiO 2 decrease that can largely offset the γ Fe x O y and γ TiO 2 /Fe x O y costs due to the creation of the new Fe x O y surface and of a highly strained TiO 2 / Fe x O y junction, respectively. The dissimilar faceting structure at the opposite basal sides of the NRs would explain why Fe x O y is ultimately localized on a single apex, likely corresponding to the one at which the excess free surface energy can be minimized. On the other side, for Fe x O y to be deposited onto the longitudinal sidewalls of NRs, where more stable low-energy b-TiO 2 facets are present and less strained TiO 2 /Fe x O y heterojunctions may be attained (cf., Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>), a proportionally smaller γ TiO 2 /Fe x O y cost has to be paid, which could be satisfactorily compensated for even by the moderate γ TiO 2 reduction. Taken together, these arguments suggest that the different HNC topologies can be all expected to be equally probable in terms of interfacial strain energy being counterbalanced by a proportionally adequate reduction in surface energy.</p><p>Role of Interface Structure and Misfit Strain. Brookite (orthorhombic) TiO 2 and inverse spinel (cubic) Fe x O y are featured by remarkably different crystal structure and lattice parameters, resulting in relatively high interfacial lattice mismatch between the joint material domains regardless of the specific topological arrangement. Fe x O y deposition can be therefore expected to be accompanied by the progressive buildup of increasingly large misfit strain energy, the ultimate effect of which being to limit the extension of the b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y bonding junction as well as to inhibit Fe x O y growth to fairly larger sizes. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> As was actually proven by our detailed HRTEM-GPA analyses (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>), HNCs formation is achieved at the cost of significant extra distortion being induced in the NR section that attains coherent connection to a Fe x O y domain. However, the possibility to synthesize HNCs equipped with Fe x O y domains as large as ∼40 nm (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) without interface dislocations suggests that here misfit strain may impose less stringent constrains on HNC formation than those concerned with their heterostructure counterparts grown from TiO 2 seeds with different structural features. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> For example, in the case of Fe x O y nucleated on anatase TiO 2 NRs, an interfacial mismatch as high as 13% could, in fact, be tolerated to the detriment of significant bending being conferred to the NR section and of Fe x O y domain size restriction down to ∼15 nm. <ref type="bibr">19a</ref> On the other hand, starting from rectangular-shaped b-TiO 2 NR seeds, unstrained b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y HNCs equipped with Fe x O y domains as large as ∼30 nm could be fabricated, the number and the location of which remaining uncontrollable. <ref type="bibr">19b</ref> The characteristics of the interfacial region between Fe x O y and b-TiO 2 should therefore play an important role in Fe x O y deposition mode, while also offering some pathways for misfit strain alleviation. Certainly, as perfect epitaxial growth of a cubic-phase Fe x O y on top of an orthorhombic TiO 2 substrate is unlikely to occur, the relevant interface may be expected to be highly defective on the atomic scale. As suggested for other HNC systems, <ref type="bibr">11a-c,12</ref> the actual junction at each TiO 2 /Fe x O y heterojunction could be thought of as being built up by a threedimensional combination of several pairs of facets of the respective materials rather than developing sharply along a single couple of planes that would extend along the entire junction. Such an intricate interface arrangement seems to be plausible in light of the rich faceting and surface irregularity of the NRs, especially at their apexes, and of the significant dissimilarity between TiO 2 and Fe x O y lattices. A complex heterojunction structure, whereby the interlocking of multiple facet couples results in a boundary region with nanometer-scale roughness, could provide convenient pathways for relieving strain that may be generated locally along specific plane associations. Strain relaxation could be achieved, for instance, by local near-interface plane bending or via elastic redistribution across less detrimentally mismatched neighboring junctions and consequent propagation far from the interfacial region. Actually, our HRTEM experimental insight complemented by interface modeling (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>) has suggested that the coherent attachment between the b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y domains realizes strain compensation through three-dimensional association of heterointerfaces, each characterized by different lattice matching degree. <ref type="bibr">11a-c,12,15</ref> In support of this picture, our HRTEM-GPA strain maps have pointed out that the lattice-mismatched conditions attained at b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y bonding junctions cause the b-TiO 2 section of the HNCs to experience noticeable extra tension that concentrates at the interface edges and propagates far away from the nearjunction region deeper into the seed portion adjacent to the Fe x O y . It is remarkable that the strain signature ultimately spans a b-TiO 2 seed area twice as extended as that shadowed by Fe x O y domains, beyond which it vanishes more or less abruptly, leaving the remaining b-TiO 2 section virtually undistorted. The lattice compression or dilatation experienced by the decorated b-TiO 2 NRs is an effect clearly distinct from the deformation associated with its pre-existent longitudinal curvature, which concertedly varies to only a negligible extent (cf., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In this regard, it is conceivable that, in addition to the attainment of a nanoscale-roughened junction region, other circumstances favorable to efficient withstanding of strain could be provided</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆G S ) γ TiO 2 -γ Fe x O y + γ TiO 2 /Fe x O y (3)</formula><p>by the inherent geometric features of the seeds. Curved b-TiO 2 NRs with small diameter and high aspect ratios, like those exploited here, could, on one side, offer better local lattice matching conditions for Fe x O y deposition and, on the other side, act as elastically deformable platforms across which interfacial strain can be dissipated remotely, circumventing plastic relaxation via defect generation. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> Lattice expansion or contraction in the curved NRs represents the sole price that the heterostructured system has to pay to achieve coherent b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y attachment without formation of misfit dislocations at a proportionally much smaller cost of increased surface energy. <ref type="bibr">1,19a,15,40,54</ref> On the other end, on the basis of previous investigations, 19a significant accentuation of the pristine curvature of the seeds should have been expected to take place only in response to much higher misfit values than those assessed for the present heterostructures.</p><p>The formation of HNCs in an exclusive heterodimer configuration can also be rationalized on the basis of the strain energy argument above. Indeed, intensification and far-from-interface propagation of strain fields along the rapid growth of the primarily nucleated Fe x O y domain can be expected to render the seed underneath less prone to tolerate additional mismatched heterojunctions. This could accordingly explain why reiteration of Fe x O y deposition events on individual NRs was never achieved even when heterostructure growth was propelled by excess reactant feeding. A similar impact on HNC growth mode was reported for Fe x O y grown with straight, low aspect-ratio anatase TiO 2 NRs, which acquired curvature in response to extreme misfit strain, ultimately permitting accommodation of only a single Fe x O y domain per seed. 19a Another factor preventing multiple heterogeneous nucleation could be the strain-driven modification of the inner permanent electric dipole associated with one-dimensional nanostructures with noncentrosymmetric or deformed lattice, <ref type="bibr">14,17c,55</ref> which would result in an inhibitory influence similar to that caused by b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y interfacial polarization effects invoked previously. In earlier reports on the synthesis of single-tipped matchstickor double-tipped dumbbell-like HNCs, the strong preference for a foreign material to nucleate onto the apexes of NR seeds was assumed to be intrinsically consistent with the mechanism of their anisotropic growth. According to the latter, the NR tips should correspond to the fastest-growing lattice directions, as they accommodate facets with much higher chemical reactivity and/or ineffective surfactant passivation. 1,10-18 However, a few approaches have so far allowed a given NR seed to be decorated with a different material domain at selected locations in a controllable manner. This opportunity has been shown to be viable for systems in which seed accessibility is strictly controlled by the ligand concentration 15,17a or unusual intraparticle ripening mechanisms are operative. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The results reported for the present b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y heterostructures illustrate a clear case where topological control can be achieved by associating seeds with suitable structural requirements with a particular reaction kinetics regime. This is highlighted by the following observations. First, the injection-modulated experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) have pointed out that the Fe(CO) 5 to b-TiO 2 seed molar ratio realized in the primary fast precursor addition step regulates the site selectivity achievable, that is, the yield of matchstick HNCs relative to other heterostructure types, as well as the size of the Fe x O y domains initially formed at the respective locations. These findings imply that the probability of heterogeneous Fe x O y nucleation and the rate at which the latter takes place depend on the particular b-TiO 2 seed sites available, to an extent that is dictated by the initial degree of solution supersaturation. In particular, the NR tips appear to be the most reactive locations at high nominal Fe(CO) 5 to b-TiO 2 molar ratios, while the longitudinal sidewalls become progressively more accessible at lower precursor concentration (cf., Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). Thus, although the tapered b-TiO 2 NRs may possess spatially anisotropic accessibility toward Fe x O y , nevertheless such potential reactivity does require high monomer fluxes to be boosted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of Heterostructure Topology</head><p>Second, it should be considered that the possibility of governing the HNC topology remained prohibited for syntheses seeded with other types of shape-and crystal-phase-tailored TiO 2 NCs in similar surfactant environments. For example, the use of anatase NRs (short/long axis: 3-4 nm/20-30 nm), which possessed stepped longitudinal sidewalls and flat basal sides, 56 led to topologically uncontrolled heterodimer HNCs, 19a while rectangular-shaped b-TiO 2 NRs (short/long axis tunable between 3-10 and 30-200 nm, respectively), which were enclosed by smooth longitudinal surfaces and rounded or flat apexes, 27 afforded hetero-oligomer HNCs made by multiply Fe x O yfunctionalized NRs with randomly positioned Fe x O y domains. 19a On comparing the reactivity of the present shape-tapered b-TiO 2 NRs with that of their rectangular-shaped counterparts, 19a it emerges that even anisotropically shaped seeds with nominally identical sizes, crystallographic structure, and lattice orientation can exhibit remarkably different seeding capabilities, depending on subtle differences in their respective morphological profiles. In this respect, it appears clear that the availability of unique sets of small facets at the arrow-like terminations of the tapered b-TiO 2 NRs should be at the basis of their superior versatility as seeds for spatially selective Fe x O y deposition.</p><p>As a matter of fact, neither the CNT arguments (eqs 1 and 2) nor the surface energy balance criterion of heteroepitaxial growth (eq 3) can satisfactorily explain which spatial architecture the HNCs will be ultimately adopt for a given set of experimental conditions. Actually, as discussed earlier, the b-TiO 2 / Fe x O y junction arrangements, which we have most frequently observed, appear to be all equally convenient in terms of the surface-interface energy change associated with their formation, as well as in terms of efficiency of interfacial strain energy dissipation. Therefore, rationalization of the observed dependence of HNC topology on the initial b-TiO 2 NR to Fe(CO) 5 ratio would imply that the "wetting" condition described by eqs 1,2 or eq 3 should be fulfilled selectively for either a matchsticklike or the random heterodimer HNC configuration in response to alterations in the reaction environment.</p><p>It could be presumed that a variation in the initial b-TiO 2 to Fe(CO) 5 ratio could be accompanied by changes in the relative proportions of the NRs to free surfactants and Fe-surfactant complexes in the growing environment. Facet-preferential adhesion of such species to the seeds as well as to the growing Fe x O y domains could affect f(θ) in eq 1 or, equally, the γ TiO 2 and γ Fe x O y terms in eq 3, in turn influencing the ultimate surfaceinterface energy balance that may dictate the preference for either HNC topologies. However, such hypothesis is discredited by our systematic scrutiny of the effect of various reaction parameters on the product outcome, which confirmed that the correlation between the HNC topology and the initial b-TiO 2 to Fe(CO) 5 ratio was maintained irrespective of the reactant composition over the wide range (even under circumstances leading to undesired homogeneous nucleation of separate Fe x O y NCs). In this regard, it is plausible that the particular ternary ligand environment used for stabilizing the HNCs builds up a robust organic shell around the NRs, which cancels out any expected spatially differential accessibility already at low stabilizer concentration.</p><p>It is also notable that the HNCs do not undergo any topological transition after the initially nucleated Fe x O y domains have completed their growth and/or the monomer concentration has been replenished by supplemental reactant additions, in contrast to what has been reported for heterostructures based on noble metals and metal chalcogenide materials. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> Actually, taking into account the nonhydrolytic condensation pathways leading to Fe x O y formation and the chemical stability of both TiO 2 and Fe x O y under our reaction conditions, redox or atomic exchange reactions are unlikely to come into play and drive interconversion between different topologies.</p><p>The microscopic origin of the growth modes of the present TiO 2 /Fe x O y HNCs can be clarified by complementing the thermodynamic picture with kinetic arguments. We propose that the current results can be better rationalized within the frame of a diffusion-controlled growth model, analogous to the one used to account for the anisotropic shape evolution of metal chalcogenide NCs as a function of the relevant monomer concentration in the growing medium. <ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">36</ref> Actually, the hypothesis of HNC growth being governed by reaction-controlled mechanism is in apparent contrast with our experimental evidence. In fact, if Fe x O y heterogeneous nucleation were the rate-limiting step, the Fe x O y monomer concentration should be constant throughout the bulk solution as well as in proximity of the NRs. Assuming that Fe x O y monomers generated through the primary injection step suffice to raise the solution chemical potential beyond the level corresponding to the seed lattice atoms, then the Fe x O y deposition rate at each NR facet should be proportional to its reactivity and surface area, as well as to the monomer concentration. Apparently, this picture cannot explain the exclusive formation of binary HNCs in heterodimerlike configuration, whereas it would instead predict similar distribution of heterostructure topologies for samples grown under varying precursor supply. In addition, within the frame of a reaction-limited model, syntheses that are performed combining large, high aspect-ratio seeds with high Fe(CO) 5 loading should yield multiply decorated hetero-oligomer HNCs, in which the tip-localized Fe x O y domains differ in size from those grown at the sidewalls of their NR section. However, such heterostructure types were never observed by us (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</p><p>We suggest that a diffusion-controlled growth mechanism 1,34,36 can provide a better basis for rationalizing HNC formation and their switchable topology, as sketched in Scheme 2.</p><p>Let us first consider the situation of the seeded solution environment prior to Fe(CO) 5 injection. In the hot surfactant mixture without any molecular source of crystal-building monomers, the NRs can be expected to become susceptible to slight etching as a means of re-equilibrating the chemical potential of the relevant constituent species (i.e., the b-TiO 2 monomers in this case) in the crystalline solid and solution phases, respectively. This phenomenon would result in a stagnant liquid layer around the NRs, across which a b-TiO 2 monomer flux directed from the seed outward should lead to a concentration gradient, with the monomer concentration approaching zero at the interface between the diffusion region and bulk solution (Scheme 2, part I). The high cohesive energy of the TiO 2 lattice, the stabilizing action of the surface-bound surfactants, the low diffusion coefficient of monomer species coordinated by long-chain organic stabilizers, and the short annealing time that precedes Fe(CO) 5 injection would concur to generate an overall rather smooth gradient, whereby an extremely low b-TiO 2 monomer concentration suffices to maintain the solubility equilibrium for the NRs without compromising their size and structure appreciably. Under these circumstances, the diffusion sphere front would tend to advance rather slowly over time, and the small seed concentration would minimize the probability of overlapping of neighboring diffusion spheres. In any case, the system would be largely preserved from entering any interparticle Ostwald ripening regime, because TEM monitoring indicated retention of the NR shape and dimensions. a The circle in each stage represents the interface boundary between the bulk solution and the diffusion sphere. The color shade of the circle indicates the monomer concentration gradient within the diffusion sphere. Orange and yellow arrows denote the diffusion direction and relative intensity of the b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y monomer fluxes, respectively.</p><p>One important aspect of the above picture concerns the spatial inhomogeneity of the diffusion gradient around the NRs. <ref type="bibr">34b,36b</ref> Indeed, because of their small extension, imperfect ligand passivation, and inherently higher surface energy, the unique facets at the arrow-shaped terminations of the NRs should be inherently characterized by a comparatively higher chemical potential than that of other facets. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Consequently, a steeper b-TiO 2 monomer concentration gradient and a faster diffusion flux would be established across the solution layer in proximity of the NR apexes, relative to other seed regions. These conditions will have significant implications in the mechanism of HNC formation initiated by subsequent rapid injection of Fe x O y precursors. It can actually be considered that, upon slow reaction of Fe-surfactant complexes, the bulk solution should become progressively enriched with Fe x O y monomers, which would raise the average chemical potential well beyond that in the stagnant solution at any facet of the NRs (Scheme 2, parts II-III). The Fe x O y monomers should tend to transfer across the interfaces of the diffusion spheres toward the NRs inside. The pristine mild seed-to-solution flux of the NR-detaching b-TiO 2 monomers would be readily counterbalanced and soon reversed back into an extremely more intense flux of dominant Fe x O y monomers rapidly diffusing in the opposite solution-to-seed direction. <ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">36</ref> These events would cause a significant volume contraction of the diffusion layer and establish internal gradients along which the Fe x O y monomer concentration will abruptly decrease on approaching the seed surface (Scheme 2, parts II and III).</p><p>It is worth stressing that the steepness of the Fe x O y monomer gradient as well as the monomer migration rate across the diffusion layer will be proportional to the Fe(CO) 5 amount introduced in the bulk liquid through the primary fast-injection step. This condition provides a rationale for explaining the origin of topology controlled growth of HNCs. In line with the Mullins-Sekerka kinetic instability model, 34b,37 it can be assumed that the facets, edges, and corners at the unique arrowshaped apexes of tapered NRs will protrude into zones of the diffusion sphere where they can experience a higher concentration and faster diffusion of Fe x O y monomers than the rest of the seed surface. At a high Fe(CO) 5 to NR molar ratios, the spatial extension of the diffusion layer would be sufficiently reduced, and the gradient across it would be consequently accentuated, so that ∆G het *Fe x O y for heterogeneous Fe x O y nucleation at the NR tips could be lowered due to the higher degree of local supersaturation and swift monomer supply available thereon than at other seed locations (Scheme 2, part II). As a consequence, Fe x O y deposition can be preferred at the NR apexes, whereby the structural dissimilarities of the two opposed terminations will pose the basis for a one-sided Fe x O y decoration mode. In an analogous description, the matchstick-shaped HNCs can be regarded as a kinetically favored heterostructure product resulting from fast Fe x O y nucleation overdriven by high monomer fluxes. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Actually, the tip-selective Fe x O y deposition can be thought of as sharing the same formation dynamics as that propelling the one-dimensional-only expansion of anisotropic NCs along their fastest-growing lattice directions under an extremely high chemical potential environment. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> In this picture, the particular structural profile of the seeds at their terminations represents an essential prerequisite to fully profit from diffusion-driven mechanism as a route toward topological selectivity. This is clearly highlighted by the impossibility to observe tip-specific Fe x O y nucleation either on tapered b-TiO 2 NRs that exceed a certain dimensional threshold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) or on their rectangular-shaped counterparts that are enclosed with equally perfected facets both at the tips and at their longitudinal sidewalls. <ref type="bibr">19b,27</ref> On the other hand, when the primary fast-injection step sets progressively lower Fe(CO) 5 to seed molar ratios in the reaction environment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>), milder Fe x O y monomer diffusive fluxes should be generated, and the diffusion layers should become comparatively more extended in space, with the associated concentration gradient turning smoother. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Because of the less pronounced spatial inhomogeneity of the chemical potential within the diffusion region, differences in surface accessibility among the exposed seed facets will tend to be gradually canceled out, thereby enhancing the probability of Fe x O y nucleation at sites other than the NR tips (Scheme 2, part III). The decreasing fraction of matchstick-like HNCs in favor of longitudinally decorated HNCs, along with the vanishing of the sitedependence of the Fe x O y domain size in response to progressive reduction in precursor supply, well reflects the tendency of the system to approach a Fe x O y deposition regime that is more under thermodynamic control. <ref type="bibr">34b,36</ref> In such regime, the HNC population should be characterized by a distribution of topologies matching with the relative energy stability order for the concerned HNC arrangements. Accordingly, as the different HNC configurations have been rationalized to have a similar probability of formation on the basis of surface-interface energy arguments, no selectivity for Fe x O y localization on the b-TiO 2 seeds should be observable, as experimentally proven. In an equivalent mechanistic picture, the transition from the tipselective to nonspecific Fe x O y deposition mode can be considered as sharing the same origin as that suggested for the shape evolution of anisotropic semiconductor NCs, whereby the initial kinetically overdriven one-dimensional-only development switches to a thermodynamically governed equidirectional growth regime upon progressive exhaustion of the feeding monomers. <ref type="bibr">34b,36</ref> After the heterogeneous nucleation burst, self-catalyzed reaction and consumption of reactive monomers in proximity of the primary Fe x O y patches will cause their further depletion thereon and sustain development of the Fe x O y domains. Over time, the diffusion layer should extend in space, and the overall growth rate will slow as the concentration gradient becomes smoother. However, the Fe x O y domains would always protrude further in regions of the diffusion layer characterized by comparatively higher supersaturation, keeping on growing the fastest due to the negligible ∆G* growth Fe x O y barrier. This can make Fe x O y growth process self-sustain, ultimately circumventing extra deposition events.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Magnetic Properties.</head><p>Another interesting result of this study is that the HNCs no longer exhibit the characteristic magnetic behavior of otherwise isolated spinel Fe x O y NCs, which would be dictated solely by finite size and surface effects in the dimensional regime addressed here. <ref type="bibr">33b-d,42b,44</ref> We found that, although neither H C , M S , nor T B could individually be traced to any clear size-dependent trend, however, they all followed a very similar dependence on the dimensions of the Fe x O y component (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">9</ref>). These results suggest that the properties of the HNCs should ultimately be governed by the "effective magnetic volume" of the Fe x O y domains, being dictated by their nominal size, the surface-to-volume ratio, and the extension of the actual TiO 2 -Fe x O y domains bonding region. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that the magnetic behavior of the HNCs deviated from that of corresponding NR/Fe x O y physical mixtures to an extent that could hardly be justified by</p><p>of TiO 2 -driven photocatalytic reduction (e CB TiO 2 injection is far more dominant over h VB TiO 2 injection to Fe x O y due to efficient h VB TiO 2</p><p>scavenging by the solvent) rather than of direct Fe x O y photoexcitation (Scheme 1, parts I, III). Although existence of some e CB Fe x O y stored on UV-activated Fe x O y domains cannot be ruled out, the feasibility of UBA reduction with residual e CB TiO 2 trapped in the composite photocatalysts seems to discredit attainment of charge equilibration across the b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y platforms. In a sense, the Fe x O y domains combined with photoexcited b-TiO 2 can be regarded as acting as a redox couple intermediate that serves to indirectly shuttle photogenerated TiO 2 electrons to molecular acceptor species with suitable redox potential.</p><p>Third, the UV-activated Fe x O y sections appear to be additionally capable of establishing some peculiar electronic interactions (e.g., formation of charge-transfer complex) with both the unreduced and the reduced acceptor molecules, which lead to distinguishable optical changes. The more pronounced responses observed for the photolyzed HNCs suggest that direct interfacing with TiO 2 rendered the Fe x O y domain more optically sensitive to adhesion of foreign organic species other than the solvent molecules, an effect that may additionally be exploited for sensing purposes. <ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">24</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and Conclusions</head><p>We have demonstrated a seeded-growth approach to fabricate topologically controlled magnetic-semiconductor heterodimer HNCs that individually comprise a single spherical Fe x O y domain epitaxially grown at either one apex or any location along the longitudinal sidewalls of one rod-like b-TiO 2 section. The synthetic success has been corroborated by a comprehensive compositional-structural investigation disclosing the crystallographic arrangement of the two material lattices and misfit strain distribution across individual heterostructures. On the basis of a wealth of experimental evidence, the different HNC architectures have been discussed within the frame of various mechanistic models offering complementary views of HNC formation. It has been rationalized that topology selection is ultimately achieved by combining suitably structured b-TiO 2 seeds with Fe x O y -generating pathways that allow seed accessibility to switch from a thermodynamically controlled to kinetically overdriven diffusion-limited deposition regime. It has been proposed that the spatial inhomogeneity of the chemical potential environment around the seeds can play a role in accentuating their anisotropic reactivity beyond constraints imposed by insurgence of b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y interfacial strain. These concepts can be useful to deliver additional synthetic criteria for the fabrication of a broad variety of functional heterostructures with a higher level of architectural sophistication and topological precision.</p><p>The present b-TiO 2 -Fe x O y HNCs, which group two valuable representatives of functional nanoscale magnetic and semiconductor materials in a single bifunctional nano-object, can be expected to boost all numerous applications fields related to environmental remediation, catalysis, energy, and biomedicine, which already benefit from titania and iron oxide individually. Our preliminary magnetic and photocatalytic investigations have highlighted that the creation of bonding heterojunctions leads to significantly modified or even unexpected physical-chemical behavior, relative to that offered by b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y alone. This allows envisioning that further advances in development of multimaterial heterostructures with ingeniously designed compositional and geometric parameters may offer new sets of properties, not otherwise accessible with the current library of conventional single-component nanostructures, which could open up new opportunities in nanoscience and nanotechnology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

In principle, T B should scale with the Fe x O y volume, V Fe x O y , because T B ∝ K eff *V Fe x O y , where K eff is the effective anisotropy constant. The fact that T B does not vary smoothly and monotonically, as it does in isolated Fe x O y NCs, <ref type="bibr">33,42b,44</ref> indicates that K eff should vary to a different degree. One effect could be correlated to nonmonotonic size-dependence of the relative spinel phase composition that are characterized by different magnetocrystalline anisotropy. <ref type="bibr">19a,33b,c,42b,44,57</ref> For example, the largest T B and H C values recorded for HNCs tipped with ∼15 nm Fe x O y heads are consistent with the dominance of Fe 3 O 4 phase <ref type="bibr">33,42b,57</ref> revealed by XANES in this intermediate size regime (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Another more relevant effect on the thermal stability of M should arise from existence of a size distribution of interfaces at which different types of chemical bonding, electronic structure, and crystallographic coincidence hold between the b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y lattices. Actually, a relatively large bonding junction (taking a 20-40% fraction of the total Fe x O y surface) implies interruption of the roughly spherical symmetry of the Fe x O y domains that would consequently acquire extra shape and surface anisotropy. Interfacial strain can also influence local magnetic ordering to a significant extent. <ref type="bibr">58</ref> Thus, the existence of b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y heterojunctions with variable extension can be expected to affect K eff (which would otherwise be dictated mainly by magnetocrystalline and surface anisotropy) and alter the size-dependence of the energy barrier distribution, otherwise expected for isolated Fe x O y NCs <ref type="bibr">1c,d,14,15,19a,54</ref> or for Fe x O y domains sharing limited contact areas with nonmagnetic materials. <ref type="bibr">1c,19a</ref> As for what regards the saturation magnetization, it should be considered that the remarkably lower M S values characterizing the HNCs, relative to those measured for their isolated Fe x O y constituents, could hardly be rationalized on the basis of a sizedependence of the relative Fe 3 O 4 to γ-Fe 2 O 3 proportions. <ref type="bibr">33b-d,42b,44</ref> Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that the ferromagnetic character of Fe x O y should be strongly depressed in proximity of the interfacial regions, as frequently found for heterostructures based on magnetic and nonmagnetic materials sharing large interfaces <ref type="bibr">1c,d,15</ref> or undergoing interfacial reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">60</ref> Indeed, it is well established that the M S value in nanostructured spinel oxides is extremely sensitive to any changes in oxidization state of the spin-disordered surface. <ref type="bibr">57,58a,60</ref> Overall, the fact that the detailed structural-compositional features and actual extension of the b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y interfaces may broadly vary from one sample to another, also depending on the sizes of the b-TiO 2 and Fe x O y domain components, explains why the individual magnetic parameters share a similar sizedependence despite the absence of any monotonic trend.</p><p>4.3. Photocatalytic Properties. In addition to being a magnetically addressable nanocatalyst, our coupled semiconductor heterostructured system represents a complex photochemically active platform for various reasons. First, the HNCs are characterized by a type-I band alignment favorable to carrier migration from the TiO 2 to Fe x O y portion (Scheme 1). <ref type="bibr">20a,23,25,52a</ref> The heterodimer HNC configuration allows both oxide domains to be exposed to the external environment and participate in interfacial charge carrier transfer. Second, TiO 2 is known to be orders of magnitude more photocatalytically active and chemically stable under UV light than spinel Fe x O y , which, in fact, suffers from high probability of electron-hole recombination (facilitated by electron hopping between Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ lattice sites). <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">46</ref> The photoactivity of Fe x O y under visible illumination is also considered to be irrelevant. Third, the Fe x O y component itself can exhibit pronounced chemical reactivity, photocathodic corrosion <ref type="bibr">20a,25,46</ref> and redox reactions in the dark, <ref type="bibr">20a,21a-e,24,45a,49</ref> depending on the stoichiometry, phase composition, and chemical environment.</p><p>Our investigation has been focused on the UV-driven photoactivity of the HNCs in deaerated organic solvents, where reductive-type pathways are enhanced and any inherent Fe x O yrelated photocatalytic activity can be safely considered to negligible with respect to that of b-TiO 2 under the employed UV irradiation. Because spinel Fe x O y remains stable against photodissolution, it has been possible to study the inherent effect of an intimate b-TiO 2 /Fe x O y heterointerfacing on the ability of TiO 2 component to generate and accumulate electrons on the heteronanostructures under continuous irradiation. These properties were assessed by a combination of simple spectrophotometric measurements and electron titration experiments aimed at extracting charges stored on the photocatalysts and using them for dark reductions.</p><p>The following major conclusions can be drawn. First, the native e CB TiO 2 storing capability of the TiO 2 NRs is strongly depressed (down to 5-15%) when photoexcitation is accomplished in the presence of physically interacting or chemically bound Fe x O y NCs (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>). The lower e CB TiO 2 accumulation on the TiO 2 NR components can be due to the concurrent effects of Fe x O y strongly competing with TiO 2 for UV photon harvesting and of e CB TiO 2 migrating from TiO 2 to the Fe x O y domain due to type-I band alignment (Scheme 1, parts I, III). On the basis of the TiO 2 /Fe x O y /acceptor energetics (Scheme 1, parts II, IV), these e CB TiO 2 are able to reduce both UBA dye and C 60 acceptors proportionally to their availability (Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>).</p><p>Second, the UV-irradiated Fe x O y component appears to undergo topotactic transformation into a Fe 3 O 4 -like rich "reduced" form that actually shows dark redox activity analogous to that of half-metallic magnetite. <ref type="bibr">20a,21a-e,24,45a,49</ref> Such Fe 3 O 4like domains are indeed capable to contribute to further selective reduction of only C 60 (cf., Figure <ref type="figure">11b</ref>,c and e,f) as actually dictated by their lower reduction potential after UV activation, relative to that of reduced TiO 2 (cf., E CB Fe x O y and E CB TiO 2 in Scheme 1, parts II, IV). It is therefore plausible that under our reaction conditions Fe x O y reduction is achieved as a net result Supporting Information Available: Structure of the dye acceptor used in the titration experiments; additional HRTEM analyses; symmetry of brookite unit cell; modeling and simulations of interface structure; visualization of GPA-derived strain profiles; simplified finite-element calculation of TiO 2 elastic response; additional magnetic measurements; additional photocatalytic data; accuracy assessment of GPA strain analysis; and complete ref 10d.
