<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment:</head><p>The experiment has been carried out at the High Energy beam line ID15, BL.5. The geometry of the experiment is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The detector position is fixed at a large scattering angle. The energy is tuned continuously in the range from 30-50 keV with the monochromator, corresponding to the desired momentum transfer range. The analyzer selects the elastically scattered photons. Both monochromator and analyzer crystal were flat Si/TaSis crystals reflecting at the (311) plane in Laue geometry. The sample was liquid formamide OHC-NHs. The MCA spectra of Ge-solid state detector at an incident energy of 50 keV are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Discussion: Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> demonstrates, that the energy resolution obtained is clearly sufficient to separate the elastic part of the scattered intensity in the proposed geometry. The total count rate without analyzer is at the count rate limit of the Ge-detector. In the set-up with analyzer the detector is not saturated with the (unwanted) Compton scattered photons. The count rates in the present set-up (20-50 s-l) are, however, still to low to obtain a structure function a with sufficient statistical accuracy. The main problem to be surmounted are the incompatible requirements on momentum transfer and energy resolution. The first can be quite low the second has to be quite good. In order to improve the reported experiment, an analyzer (based e. g. on a bent Bragg crystal) is needed which allows to diminish the distance sample/ detector -and, hence, diminish the Q-resolution in order to gain intensity -without degrading the energy resolution. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(Q) has o t b k e nown in a large momentum transfer range Q = 47r/X sin(e), where X is the wave length and 19 is the half of the full scattering angle 26. The structure function i(Q) is related to the normalized intensity by: where I(Q) is the normalized intensity, fi are the form factors, Ci the Compton intensities and the sums are extending over the unit composition of the sample. At large momentum transfers especially when light elements are present, Compton scattering is by far dominating. The relative energy shift of Compton scattered photons at a given momentum transfer is largest for back scattering: 1 The experiment was aiming to determine i(Q) t a momentum transfer values 3OA-1 &lt; Q &lt; 5oKl.</figDesc></figure>
