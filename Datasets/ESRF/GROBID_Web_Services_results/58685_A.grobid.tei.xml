<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this project, we have applied in operando wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) to study structural transformations and determine the active phase of layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalysts during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte. NiFe LDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and CoFe LDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have been reported to exhibit high catalytic activity for OER in alkaline media, with NiFe LDH in particular showing the best performances, comparable with noble metal based catalysts such as IrO 2 in alkaline electrolyte. However, the nature of the catalytic active site is under debate. Structural transformations are induced by increasing the potential more anodic than tipical transition metals oxidation peak potential, after which OER starts, resulting in an OER active phase that is different than the as synthesized one. Due to reversibility or partial reversibility of these transformations, in operando characterization techniques are necessary to study the OER active phase. For this reason we synthesized NiFe LDH and CoFe LDH nanoplates and investigated them with in operando WAXS and Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). For electrochemical testing, an ink was prepared with unsupported catalyst particles and drop casted on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. A grazing incident diffraction (GID) cell was necessary due to strong preferential diffraction caused by the stacking of the LDH nanoplates, which excluded the use of transmission setup with the X-ray beam parallel to the stacking direction. Therefore, the experiments were performed with the GID cell, based on thin film concept. A peek foil was used as X-ray window. X-ray attenuation due to the thick electrolyte film was reduced significantly thanks to the high-energy X-ray radiation. In the case of NiFe LDH, three loadings were tested: 100 μg cm -2 (standard loading that we use also for RDE measurements), 33 μg cm -2 (1/3rd of the standard loading), 20 μg cm -2 (1/5th of the standard loading). The electrochemical measurements showed consistent behaviour with what was observed in our laboratory. Therefore WAXS was measured after each cycle during the activation cyclic voltammetry protocol developed in our laboratory and in a following constant potential protocol with potential steps of ~ 10-15 min, spanning the range from the catalytic silent state (restings state) and the OER active state. The measurements revealed the appearance of a secondary phase for potentials above the Ni oxidation potential and under OER conditions. This is particularly evident in the 003 diffraction peak, which is associated to the LDH interlayer distance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). This phase is observed to disappear when the potential is further decreased below the Ni reduction potential (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). This confirms the reversibility of the phase transformation and the necessity to use in operando techniques to characterize this phase. The loading study also shows that this phase is difficult to observe with thick samples, where most likely occurs only on a fraction of material which is well connected with the substrate and electrolyte-accessible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> SAXS was also performed at constant potentials to evaluate possible dissolution of unwanted Fe based impurity phases, observed with transmission electron microscopes. However, the SAXS measurements did not show any significant difference in the time scale of the experiment. Similar behaviour was observed with CoFe LDH. A phase with contracted interlayer distance appears after increasing the potential above the Co oxidation potential and during OER (Figure 2). Decreasing the potential below the Co reduction potential also induced an expansion of the interlayer distance. In this case, however, the bahavior is more complicated than in the case of NiFe LDH, due to multiple redox peaks in Co based materials. In conclusions, in operando WAXS revealed to be a powerful technique to monitor structural transformations leading to the OER active phases of LDH electrocatalysts. Both for NiFe LDH and CoFe LDH the active phase consists in a similar LDH structure with contracted interlayer. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: In operando WAXS showing the 003 peak of NiFe LDH at 1.6 V vs RHE in 0.1 M KOH (a).
