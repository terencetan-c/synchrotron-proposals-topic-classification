<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>PdAu alloys are promising catalysts for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). With this project, we aim to understand the formation of surface alloys from Au-Pd/C nanocomposite catalysts. Comparing different Pd-Au alloy nanoparticles prepared by a laser ablation method, we investigate the effect of the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) on the structure of the alloy. A row of PdAu nanoparticles with different compositions was exposed to formic acid-containing electrolytes and different FAOR protocols, while X-ray total scattering data were collected. To complete the structural characterization X-ray absorption spectroscopy data (XANES and EXAFS) were collected at both the Au L 3 -and the Pd K-edge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Details</head><p>In the experiment, we used our home-developed operando electrochemical flow-cell set-up optimized for X-ray scattering was used. The catalyst layers were prepared by vacuum filtration of the catalyst particles (PdAu supported on Carbon) onto a gas diffusion layer in our home lab. They were used as working electrodes in the electrochemical cell, with a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The 0.1M HClO4 electrolyte containing 0.2M HCOOH was flown through the cell during the experiment. A series of potential steps were applied, gradually stepping from the open circuit potential (OCP) to oxidizing potentials where FAOR significant currents were measured. The potential was then gradually stepped back to OCP, to observe if the changes under applied potential were reversible or not. At each potential, total scattering data were collected, at different depths of the catalyst layer. In the following, a row of cyclic voltammograms was collected during FAOR to analyze the stability of different PdAu alloy nanoparticles as FAOR catalysts. Background subtraction is necessary to treat the total scattering data. This was performed based on the different scans through the cell, where the carbon background was collected. In that way, it was possible to subtract both the contributions from the cell and electrolyte as well as from the carbon-based gas-diffusion layer. As the carbon changes as a function of applied potential, background data were recorded and subtracted for each potential step.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have analyzed the total scattering data and the PDFs that could be obtained after careful background subtraction. Due to scattering from the cell, the background scattering can account for ~95 % of the total intensity, therefore careful background subtraction is required (see Figur 1 a). We were able to successfully subtract a suitable background and extract small Bragg peaks. The small Bragg features observed in the Xray total scattering data correspond to the FCC structure type of the PdAu alloy The PDF data can be fit using small-box modeling so that lattice parameters and crystallite sizes can be extracted. Furthermore, a box-car approach has suggested that changes in the structure are different across different length scales. We have begun to investigate core-shell behavior and Pd migration as a potential cause for this. Our initial analysis of the collected PDFs from the operando experiment, indicates that the catalyst is stable under operating conditions and exhibits only very little structural changes, as shown exemplarily in Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>. We found more noticeable structural changes to occur during the preparation of the electrode and the immersion in the electrolyte (Fig <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). These structural changes that can occur during electrode preparation are often overlooked and thus these results are very interesting. We combine this fit analysis of the XAS data collected ex-situ, where we observe small changes in Pd-Au coordination for the different treatment steps as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1d</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and future work</head><p>The beamtime has been a success in demonstrating the possibility of collecting total scattering data during FAOR electrochemistry. The data can be analyzed if a very careful background subtraction is performed. The quality of background data measured is, therefore, of utmost importance. With this, it was possible to obtain analyzable PDF data that showed structural changes in the PdAu alloy catalysts. We are now in the process of analyzing the data and combining the PDF analysis with the results obtained from the ex-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. As we were not able to collect XAS data in our scattering electrochemical cell, we are now in the process of building a synchrotron operando cell suitable for both X-ray total scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.The results from this beamtime have shown that a crucial step is the catalyst preparation from the colloid and its conditioning in the acidic electrolyte. The catalysts obtained from the conditioning then appear to be stable in FAOR.</p></div>
