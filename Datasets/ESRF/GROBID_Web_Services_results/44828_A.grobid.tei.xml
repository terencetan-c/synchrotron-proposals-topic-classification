<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffraction studies of TodT and TodS</head><p>This beam-time was initially intended to collect full data sets of both TodT and TodS from small crystals and therefore the proposal was submitted to ID23 2 (see proposal mx1103). At the same time we put-in a second proposal (assigned mx1106) for the data collection of different systems. Both proposal were accepted and schedule for May (15 th /16 th ) and June (23th/24 th ) respectively. Focus in the first one (mx1106) we did not have enough time to obtain sufficient fresh crystals of two DOT-T1E components. As described in the proposal protein stability is a big issue and during this rushing period we were not able to obtained crystals of TodS and only marginal amount of crystal of TodT.</p><p>Several crystals of the complex TodT-ADN were tested but any of them were of sufficient quality for data collection. The remaining beam-time was used to complete the data collection of several systems (see below) initially intended for the previous proposal (mx1106) but that were not collected due to a communication problem between the detector and the computer/software controlling it. We lost almost a shift trying to fix this problem and moving from ID14 to ID23.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffraction studies of ancestral thioredoxin</head><p>In the previous run we collected complete data sets for two of ancestral thioredoxins, ATrx250, ATrx325. At ID23 2 we were able also to collect several complete data sets for the ancestral Trxs, ATrx205 and ATrx324. We have been able to find a MR solution for 205 but fail with 324, probably due to the low crystal quality.</p></div>

To avoid crystal damage, previously observed with this system, crystals were cryo-protected into the capillary by diffusing the cryo-protectant.
