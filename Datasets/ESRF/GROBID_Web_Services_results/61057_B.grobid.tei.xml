<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The bleaching of cadmium yellows, a class of pigments of different stoichiometry (CdS/Cd 1-x Zn x S) and crystalline structure (hexagonal/cubic), has been reported in a number of paintings by Ensor, <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Van Gogh,</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and Matisse. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> Our previous SR-based X-ray and FT-IR investigations of artificially aged paint mock-ups allowed us to achieve the following results: <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> (i) the photo-oxidation of yellow CdS/Cd 0.76 Zn 0.24 S to white CdSO 4 /CdSO 4 •nH 2 O and their photocatalytic activity are triggered by moisture, occurring at a relative humidity (RH) ≥95% but not at environmental humidity (~45% RH).</p><p>(ii) The stability of CdS-based yellows and the chemical nature of the corresponding alteration products depends on both the Cd:Zn stoichiometry and aging conditions but not on the crystalline structure of the pigment. Notably, Cd 0.76 Zn 0.24 S undergoes photo-oxidation more readily than CdS and it is a more efficient photocatalyst for the oil oxidation, giving rise also to the formation of Zn-oxalates. In dark and highly moist conditions (RH≥95%), the S 2-→SO 4 2-conversion is hindered instead. However, preliminary investigations performed on a late 19 th century cadmium yellow paints containing also Cd(OH)Cl (present as a residue of early manufacturing processes) and treated with moisture have revealed the formation of CdSO 4 . <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> This finding, in line with the fact that Cl-species were identified in degraded CdS-based paints of some artworks by Matisse <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> leaves open the question of whether and to what extent Cl-compounds and moisture affect the decay of CdS-based paints. To this aim, the experiment has focused on the study of a series of CdS-based oil paint mock-ups as well as historical oil paint tubes containing chlorides before and after different artificial aging treatments (with light or moisture). Investigations of the oil paint mock-ups were also combined with the analysis of several micro-flakes obtained from the painting The Scream (1910?) by E. Munch (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>The following materials have been analyzed at the ID21 beamline: a) S-/Cd-/Cl-reference compounds (about 10 in total); b) CdS-based oil paint mock-ups and late 19 th century cadmium yellow paint tubes (20 in total) before and after exposure to different aging conditions (exposure to either UVA-Visible light or RH≥95%); c) Original paint micro-flakes (6 in total) obtained from a flaked-off CdS-based yellow paint of the lake region of The Scream (1910?) (Munch Museum, Oslo, Norway). By using the microtome avalialble at the ID21-beamline, all oil paints were prepared as thin sections (average thickness of 5 μm). Both thin sections and original paint micro-flakes have been fixed on sulfur-free tape and then covered with an ultralene film.</p><p>Measurements were performed at the scanning X-ray microscope (SXM) and the full field (FF)-XANES endstations. Investigations were carried out by means of a fixed exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator at both the SXM and FF-XANES end-stations. The energy calibration was performed using CaSO 4 •2H 2 O, NaCl and a Cd foil as standards and by setting the position of the peak maximum of their first order derivative spectrum at 2.4829, 2.8261 and 3.5418 keV, respectively. At the SXM-end station, the incident beam was focused with Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors down to a diameter of ca. 0.6×0.4 µm² (h×v). XRF signals were collected in the horizontal plane and at 69° with respect to the incident beam direction by means of a single energy-dispersive silicon drift detector (Xflash 5100, Bruker). Single point μ-XANES spectra were acquired in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy at the absorption edge of the following elements: S K-edge (2.46-2.53 keV; energy step: 0.18 eV), Cl K-edge (2.79-2.89 keV; energy step: 0.25 eV), and Cd L 3 -edge ( 3.5-3.7 keV; energy step: 0.4 eV). μ-XRF mapping experiments were performed using a monochromatic primary beam of fixed energy around the S K-and Cd L 3 -edges. Maps of the same region of interest were collected by employing either 80 or 100 ms/pixel at the three following energies: (i) 2.473 keV and 2.482 keV to favor the excitation of the S -II -and S VI -species, respectively and (ii) 3.7 keV to obtain the XRF intensity of all S-, Cl-and Cd-species. The software PyMCA was used to fit the XRF spectra and to separate the contribution of different elements, whilist ATHENA [9] was employed to perform the normalization of the XANES spectra. Cd L 3 -edge FF-XANES imaging of thin sections (~5 µm thickness) obtained from a selection of the artificially aged oil paints and original paint micro-flakes was carried out by an unfocused beam (size of ~1.5×1.5 mm 2 ). A Lu 2 SiO 5 :Tb scintillator (located less than 2 mm downstream the sample) was used to convert X-ray transmission images into visible images. A 10× optical objective was employed to magnify the image onto a CMOS camera (PCO edge, Germany), giving a pixel size of ~0.65×0.65 μm 2 and a spatial resolution of ~1.5 μm. The maximum field of view is around 1.5×1.5 mm 2 . A stack of 214 X-ray radiographs was recorded, while tuning the X-ray energy across the Cd L 3 -edge with the following variable step sizes: i) 5 eV in the 3.4880-3.5239 keV and 3.6380-3.7180 keV range, ii) 0.5 eV in the 3.2530-3.5980 keV region and iii) 1 eV in the 3.5980-3.6380 keV range. The dark and flat field correction and the images alignment were performed by employing the Spectrocrunch library. The TXM-Wizard software package [10] was used to produce the chemical state maps of different Cd-compounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>3.1. Artificially aged CdS-based oil paints. As an example the SR μ-XRF and μ-XANES results obtained from a thermally aged oil paint mock-up prepared by mixing CdS and Cd(OH)Cl (called CdS Cd(OH)Cl ) before and after exposure to moisture (RH=95%, T=40°C, 100 days), is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Before aging (results not reported), S-and Cl-speciation investigations reveal that Cd(OH)Cl particles/aggregates are homogenously distributed within the yellow paint, where only S -II -species (CdS) were found. As a consequence of the aging, a bleaching appears in selected areas of the paint surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). SR µ-XRF maps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) show that these whitish regions are mainly composed of Cd and Cl with minor abundances of S. The S-speciation maps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) and the S K-edge µ-XANES spectra (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>: pt 03 S ) show the formation of sulfate-based compounds in the (Cd,Cl)-rich area at the surface, whereas only CdS (pts 01 S , 02 S ) is present in the Cl-free/poorest regions underneath. Comparable results have been obtained from other CdS-based oil paint mock-ups and late 19th century cadmium yellow paint tubes containing other types of Cl-based compounds (i.e. CdCl 2 , KCl) and aged under similar conditions. In addition, the sporadic presence of sufiltes has been also frequently observed in such samples. Diversely, no evidence of the formation of oxidized S-species has been observed instead in the equivalent paints aged with UV-Visible light and at environment moisture conditions (RH≈45%) (results not reported). Overall these analysis show that moisture and Cl-compounds promote the oxidation of CdS to cadmium sulfates. 3.2 Original paint micro-flakes from "The Scream (1910?)" SR μ-XRF and S-chemical speciation maps of original paint micro-flakes obtained from The Scream (1910?) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>,B; as an example, only the results of one of them are reported) revealed that Cd and S -II -species are homogenously distributed throughout the yellowish paint, while S VI -compounds are localized as agglomerates. S -II -and S VI -species are unambiguously identified in the S K-edge µ-XANES spectra (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>) by the signals at ~2.473 and ~2.482 keV, for sulfides (S - II ) and sulfates (S VI ) respectively. Among the S-containing phases, the comparison with the XANES spectra of selected reference compounds reveals that the paint matrix is mainly composed of CdS (spectra not shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>), whereas the sulfate agglomerates are made of Na 2 SO 4 and/or CdSO 4 . (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>: pts 01 s ,02 s ). The original and newly formed Cd-species are better visualized in the FF-XANES Cd-phase images (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>) in which, within the CdS/CdCO 3 -based paint matrix, CdSO 4 and CdCl 2 •nH 2 O/Cd(OH)Cl are also present. The identification of highly water soluble materials, such as Na 2 SO 4 and (Cd,Cl)compounds opens the question whether and to what extent their solubility influences the degradation state of the cadmium yellow paint under high humidity conditions. This was further studied by analyzing before and after aging (RH≥95%, T=40°C) two additional oil paint mock-ups prepared by mixing CdS with Na 2 SO 4 and CdCl 2 . The results (not shown) clearly revealed that after exposure to moisture, soluble Na 2 SO 4 and CdCl 2 dissolve, migrate through the paint and, upon re-crystallization, give rise to CdSO 4 -and NaCl-based compounds. Based on these results, it follows that CdSO 4 may not only be present as an oxidation product of the original CdS pigment (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) or as a leftover synthesis reagent but also as a secondary product arising from the dissolution and re-crystallization of soluble leftover reagents. The results obtained from this experiment will be published soon.  </p></div>
