<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Vineyard soils are frequently contaminated with copper due to the application of copper-based fungicides, such as the Bordeaux mixture composed of CuSO4 and Cu(OH)2, even in organic viticulture. Phytoremediation can serve as an alternative to extract a portion of Cu from these soils, and indigenous plants naturally growing in vineyards might be valuable for this purpose <ref type="bibr">(Cornu et al., 2021)</ref>. Two indigeneous plant species, Amaranthus retroflexus and Chenopodium album, were selected and grown in pot experiments in the native soil (containing 40 ppm of Cu) and in the native soil doped with 250 ppm, and 400 ppm of Cu from Bordeaux mixture. The objective of this study was to identify the speciation of copper in the various organs of the plants and in the vineyard soils to establish the mechanisms of Cu transformation and sequestration in the plants. For that, we used Cu K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods</head><p>Cu concentrations were measured by ICP MS in plant organs (roots, leaves, stems, and fruits), and they were below 20 μg.g -1 (Dry Weight) in all the aerial parts (leaves, stems and fruits) whatever the Cu exposure (40, 250 or 400 ppm). In contrast, roots from both species showed higher copper concentrations, ranged from 20 to 50 μg Cu.g -1 DW, 350-380 μg Cu.g -1 DW and 430-580 μg Cu.g -1 DW for 40 ppm, 250 ppm and 400 ppm exposure, respectively. These concentrations suggested a strategy of metal exclusion and we focused on roots and soils samples to go deeper in the understanding of this strategy. A. retroflexus and C. album roots were carefully washed, frozen, ground using liquid nitrogen, and prepared as frozen pressed pellet. Due to limited beamtime, we analyzed only the 40 and 450 ppm Cu exposures (4 root samples). Soil samples were air-dried, sieved at 2 mm, finely ground, and subsequently pelletized. We analyzed the 40 and 450 ppm soils before and after the culture including a control with no plant, thus accounting to 8 soil samples.</p><p>Fifteen Cu references 7 including mineral (Cu(0), CuSO4, CuCO3, Bordeaux mixture, Cu(OH)2, Cu2S, Cuphosphate) and 9 organic compounds (Cu-acetate, Cu-humic acid, Cu-fulvic acid, Cu-pectine, Cu-cellulose, Cuhistidine, Cu-citrate, Cu-malate and Cu(I)-cysteine) were prepared as powdered pellets or aqueous solutions and analyzed. Plants, soils and references samples were mounted on a Al holder and Cu K-edge EXAFS spectra were collected in fluorescence mode using a 13-element detector and a Si(220) monochromator. All measurements were done using a helium cryostat at 10 K. EXAFS spectra for soils and roots were then compared to Cu reference spectra and treated by Linear Fitting Combination (LCF) of reference spectra. Data treatment is still in progress and shell simulation will be performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cu in roots:</head><p>EXAFS spectra showed that spectra from the two plant species for the 40 ppm exposure were similar and differed from the spectra for the 400 ppm exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Both root spectra from the 400 ppm exposure were also similar indicating that Cu speciation was similar in the two plant species. Comparison with Cu references showed that spectra from the 400 ppm exposure have a frequency and spectral features ressembling those of organic Cu compound with carboxyl/hydroxyl ligands (e.g. cellulose) or amine ligands (e.g. histidin). In contrast, spectra of the 40 ppm exposure were more similar to Cu(0), questionning the origin of this metal copper. LCF indicated that COOH/OH ligand (potentially provided by Cu-cellulose ranged between 61 and 66 ± 10 % and Cu-histidine between 34 and 39 ± 10 % for the high exposure. For the native soil, best fits were found for a mixture of carboxyl group (63-79 ± 10 % ) and Cu(0) (21-37% ± 10 % )(Fig 3 .). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cu in soils:</head><p>We measured EXAFS of soils doped with 400 ppm Cu (Bordeaux mixture), before culture (S Pre-cult 400) and after culture of A. retroflexus (S TF A.retroflexus 400) and C. album (S TF C. album 400), along with a control soil that underwent the watering process in the greenhouse without cultivation (S Control 400). Similarly, we examined the same soils at a lower Cu concentration (40 ppm) before culture (S Pre-cult 40) and after culture (STF A.retroflexus 40, STF C. album 40, S Control 40). The spectrum of soil at 400 ppm before the pot experiment showed a first oscillation that is asymetric. This asymetry was not clearly observed in the control at the end of the experiment, suggesting that the watering process and maturation has slighlty changed Cu speciation in the soil. The initial spectrum was also different from the one of Bordeaux mixture indicating that Cu has been probably dissolved and evolved into other chemical species. The spectra from roots at 400 ppm slightly differed from the soil at the end of the experiment (arrows), suggesting that the pattern of Cu species has evolved. LCF is in progress to identify and quantify the Cu species in the soil. The 40 ppm soils spectra are quite noisy but seem to be different than the 400 ppm soils. As for roots, we suspect the occurrence of Cu(0) in the signature, and work is in progress to chek this point. .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our results showed that both plant species have similar Cu-speciation in the roots suggesting a commun mechanism of Cu sequestration, resulting from complexation by O from carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as well as N ligands. The occurrence of Cu(0) in roots for the low Cu exposure is questioning and needs to be confirmed. In soils, Cu is not present as Bordeaux mixture and data treatment is still in progress to clarify the Cu speciation.</p></div>
