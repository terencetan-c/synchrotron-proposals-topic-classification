De Santis Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): -M. De Santis*, Y. Gauthier* Laboratoire de Cristallographie de Grenoble -P. Varga*, R. Koller* Institut für Allgemeine Physik, TU Wien, Wiedener Hauptstr. 8-10 / 134, A-1040 Wien, Austria Report: The sample originally planned (Pt 25 Rh 75 (110)) [1,2] revealed totally unfit to surface x-ray diffraction analysis (much too large mosaic spread); Fortunately, the crystal could be replaced at the last minute by another with very close composition and structure, Pt 50 Rh 50 (110). By chance, all phenomena, expected on the former -phase transition with temperature in relation to segregation -do occur on Pt 50 Rh 50 (110) too. The experiments were performed from June 19 to June 26 2000 on the French -Interfaces line at ESRF. This system, Pt 50 Rh 50 ( <ref type="bibr">110)</ref>, was only partially known on a structural point of view at room temperature (RT) from LEED observations. The surface reconstructs, in the manner of (110) faces of Pt, Au and Ir , or of previously analysed bimetallic alloys ( Pt 80 Fe 20 ) with a (1x3) symmetry <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref> : two dense rows, out of three in the top layer, and one in the second layer are missing. The surface is constituted of valleys the slopes of which are (111) microfacets. This is at least what could be derived from the striking similarities in the I(V) spectra from PtRh and PtFe, the details of the structure requiring a thorough analysis of the data.</p><p>From LEIS (Low Energy Ion scattering) experiments performed on the other crystal (Pt 25 Rh 75 ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>)) [1,2], we expect, on Pt 50 Rh 50 (110), a modification of the composition of the outermost layers with increasing temperature, change related to the deconstruction of the surface which ends up with a (1x1) symmetry (?). However, as the composition is not the same -which means also slightly different interatomic distances -, an identical behaviour for both crystals was not obvious. The low temperature structure was measured using integer and fractional order CTR. The quantitative analysis (in progress) should allow to extract the details of the atomic arrangement in the 3-4 surface layers. The high sensitivity of x-rays to lateral displacements (i.e., parallel to the sample surface) should be an asset for deriving the pairing of the dense rows in layers 2 and 3. This work is being performed simultaneously with a quantitative LEED analysis : this latter method is more sensitive to concentrations and vertical shifts so that the combination of both techniques should give the whole picture.</p><p>The first results do confirm the missing row model. As for already known noble metals, this reconstruction is accompanied by an important contraction of interlayer distances and by buckling (0.1 à 0.Å) in several layers as well as pairing in at least two layers.</p><p>To this reconstruction is associated a strong Pt segregation in all dense rows exposed to vacuum and a marked depletion in the rows just underneath (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Concerning the behaviour with increasing temperature, in the 0° à 950 °C range, we were able to show that the (1x3) symmetry disappears around 750 °C to yield a (1x1) symmetry which is quite typical of the volume phase. This is clearly obvious from the decrease -down to zeroof the intensity of the 1/3 order rods in the in plane scans (0k) and from the clear modifications of the intensity of integer rods. This symmetry change is totally correlated with LEIS measurements -realised early august -which reveal a striking reduction with increasing temperature of the Pt concentration in surface layers : this composition tends asymptotically towards that of the deep bulk, 50-50%. Moreover, the total ion yield increases (for T increase from 0 to 850°C) is also characteristic of fully occupied surface layers (i.e. (1x1) symmetry). Surface segregation of Rh has the effect of a reduction of the elastic strains (Rh is ~2% smaller than Pt) which, likely, is at the origin of the observed deconstruction.</p><p>A detailed interpretation of the data is underway.</p><p>[1] E.
