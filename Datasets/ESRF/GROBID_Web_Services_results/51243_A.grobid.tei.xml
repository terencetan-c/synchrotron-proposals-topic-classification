<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XAS and RIXS Studies of Nitrogenases</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Scientific Background: Nitrogenase is a complex enzyme containing a MoFe 7 S 9 C active site, the so called FeMoco cluster (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), which enable the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia under ambient conditions. In contrast the industrial process using heterogeneous catalysts requires high temperatures and pressures. This has thus motivated great interest in how the biological system enables this remarkable conversion. It was relatively recently (~2 years ago) that XES spectroscopy, by our group revealed the presence of a central carbon in this cluster. With the atomic composition of the cluster now understood, we have turned our focus to understanding the electronic structure of this complex cluster. Namely, the important questions to address are the oxidation states of the Mo and of the Fe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Our ID-26 beam time has employed a combination of Mo HERFD and Fe K-α RIXS measurements in order to obtain insight into the FeMoco cluster. Previously (under proposal 3556) we obtained Mo HERFD data on a series of monomeric and dimeric Mo model complexes. These data were calculated using a TDDFT approach, and served as an essential calibration for understaning the Mo HERFD spectra. These results were recently submitted for publication.</p><p>Comparison of the Mo models to the nitrogenase protein data, however, required the synthesis and characterization of more complex model complexes. Hence during the present experimental run, we obtained data on models of increasing complexity, which incorporated both Mo and Fe. These models are depcited in Figure 1 below. These results were correlated to TDDFT calculations, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. The results show an excellent correlation between experiment and theory. Importantly, with these data, we were able to show that the commonly accepted assumption of a Mo(IV) in the active site of nitrogenase is incorrect. Our results thus provide evidence for a more reduced Mo site and indicate an essential role of the Mo in the magnetic coupling within the cluster. The results thus contrast what is commonly accepted in the literature and will likley have a great impact on our understanding of the electronic structure and its contribution to function. A manuscript describing these results is currently being prepared for submission.</p><p>In addition to the Mo HERFD data, Fe 1s2p RIXS and Fe HERFD data were obtained for both the nitrogenase protein and the model complexes. Preliminary RIXS planes for the protein are shown below (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). The protein data is complicated by the fact that the MoFe protein contains both the FeMo cofactor (the active site of interest) and a second eight iron site (the so called P-clusters).</p><p>Our collaborators (O. einsle) can prepare a gene deletion mutation of the protein which loads only the p-clusters. By obtaining data on this form, we should be able to isolate the FeMo cofactor contribution to the Fe RIXS.</p><p>Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that 1s2p RIXS on the dilute protein is feasible, though a large number of protein samples will be required to obtain damage free data with sufficient signal to noise.</p><p>In addition we will collect data on the isolated cofactor (in NMF). We hope to complete the required Fe RIXS measurements in a future ID26 run. By obtaining these data a deatiled picture of the resting state of nitrogenase will be in hand and we will be well positioned to begin more detailed studies of later states in the catalytic cycle. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Pieter Glatzel -European Synchrotron Radiation Facility Prof. Dr. Frank Neese -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion Prof. Dr. Serena DeBeer* -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion Prof. Dr. Oliver Einsle -University Freiburg Christopher Pollock* -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion Vlad Martin-Diaconescu* -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion Frederico Alves Lima* -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion</figDesc></figure>
