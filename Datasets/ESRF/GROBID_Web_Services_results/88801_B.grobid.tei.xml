<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Our novel in-house developed experimental laser sintering setup, designed and constructed at the Polymer Technology section, TU Eindhoven, has the unique ability to allow in-situ time-resolved microscopic and X-ray observations of laser sintering with precise control over all sintering parameters. Since structure evolution and crystallization kinetics during laser sintering are complex and coupled processes involving non-isothermal, non-homogeneous temperature profiles and complex flow fields, this laser sintering setup provides direct access to essential local and time-resolved information about the structural processes involved. Experiments using this setup can provide us with essential knowledge to understand the relations between sintering conditions and microstructure development. The study on the sintering of PA12 particle pairs performed at ESRF demonstrates that real-time information about the sintering dynamics as well as the crystallization kinetics can be obtained with a good signalto-noise ratio and with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. Since the experiments performed at ESRF show the feasibility of the approach, we can conclude that our unique device opens up new promising perspectives in the field of 3D printing by selective laser sintering. Results Figure 2 (a) integrated intensity as a function of scattering vector q, before and after sintering. The markers represent the radially integrated pattern obtained from experiments and the lines represent the sum of fitted peaks using a Gaussian-Lorentzian function. The grey dotted line is the amorphous halo and the grey solid line is the peak fit of the crystalline peak. (b) Image sequence of time-resolved 2D-WAXD patterns of PA12, before and during sintering for PA12 particles of radius a o = 115 μm.(c) 3D plot of the radially integrated intensity as a function of scattering vector q for the complete acquisition time. Red line represents the amorphous halo before crystallization starts.</p><p>To demonstrate how laser sintering affects the crystal morphology, the intensity profile before sintering is compared with that after sintering (figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(c) shows these intensity profiles, obtained from radially integrating the intensity over an azimuthal angle of 90 o (figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) and plotting it versus scattering vector q as a function of time up to the point at which steady state was reached. The integrated intensity, peak position, and peak width were obtained by fitting the curve with a double Gaussian-Lorentzian function. The crystallinity was calculated from the deconvolution of the total intensity into the amorphous and crystalline contributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3 Influence of particle size on crystallization kinetics during sintering of PA12 particle doublets, chamber temperature (left) 155 o C (right) 110 o C</head><p>Similar experiments were performed for varying processing conditions like particle size and chamber temperature, as shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Clear differences can be observed in crystallization kinetics that can only be studied via such in-situ experiments. These experimental data from a case study on PA12 particles, which demonstrate the unique capability of our setup to capture the kinetics of the development of the macrostructure in the form of neck radius growth as well as the microstructure in the form of crystallinity and crystal-type evolution during laser sintering. The results also illustrate the accuracy with which these features can be obtained. Future experiments at different processing conditions for different classes of polymers ranging from commodity polymers like polystyrene to high performance polymers like polyether ether ketone can be sintered in the setup. The setup is also flexible towards the use of small angle X-ray scattering or more local characterizations using a more pronounced focusing of the X-ray beam.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.</head><p>Do you expect any scientific output from this experimental session (publication, patent …) YES. Two publications are expected from this work. A scientific outcome (publication) describing the setup and proof-of-concept of the in-situ X-ray studies during laser sintering has already been submitted to the international peer-reviewed journal Review of Scientific Instruments. Another publication that focusses on the effects of processing conditions on the crystallisation process of Pa12 during laser sintering is in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Photograph of the experimental setup installed in the BM26 beamline at ESRF.
