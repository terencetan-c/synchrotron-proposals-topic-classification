<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have investigated strongly strained Sir,Ge, islands grown on Cz grown Si (001) substrates by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) at a temperature of 600" C (Bi solution). The growth has been performed in Stranski-Krastanov growth mode and the islands are monodisperse truncated pyramids terminated by (1 1 1)-facets, as can been observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The homogeneity in size and shape over macroscopic distances can be qualitatively understood when taking into account that LPE takes place rather close to thermal equilibrium. For that reason the island base width w does not depend on growth kinetics, but simply scales with the Ge concentration x only. In addition, ordering effects appear as clearly visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Here, the preferential ordering direction is &lt;loo&gt; and we observe extended rows of islands along these directions (i.e. island base diagonal). The aim of our study was to investigate strength and direction of ordering as a function of the island density. We have investigated our samples already in a previous grazing incidence small angle scattering (GISAXS) experiment carried out at BW2 beamline at HASYLAB/DESY [I]. However, the resolution was restricted to AqX = 1.8. 10m3A1, so that samples with low island densities, i.e. large island spacings, (&lt;d&gt; &gt; 400 nm), could not be investigated. Also the inherent line width of the observed satellite peaks which contains information about the lateral island-island correlation length, 5, was restricted by the experimental resolution. We have carried out GISAXS at ESRF at BM5 (Optics Beamline) and we have achieved a resolution of AqX = 6.0.10aA1 (FWHM) at an x-ray energy of 9.0 keV. This gives us the opportunity to measure the inherent line width of the ordering satellite peaks. We have investigated samples from medium (w/cd&gt; = 0.45) up to high (w/cd&gt; = 0.75) island densities. Samples with island densities well below w/cd&gt; &lt; 0.45 have been investigated by AFM. We can briefly summarize our results as following: l For very small coverages, ( w/cd&gt; c 0.1 ) we can observe ordering developing along the base diagonal, i.e. along the &lt;loo&gt; directions.</p><p>l With increasing coverage the degree of ordering increases. At medium island densities correlation along &lt;loo&gt; is dominating, however, there is already slight ordering developing along cl lo&gt;.</p><p>l At high island densities we can observe additional ordering along &lt;llO&gt;. At very high island density (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) the ordering along cl lO&gt; is even stronger than along &lt;loo&gt;: &amp;roo, = 400 nm, &amp;110, = 600 nm, w = 160 nm, &lt;d&gt; = 215 nm.</p></div>

In order to illustrate the experimental resolution (n/vHM of specular beam) the curve along &lt;llO&gt; is shown with and without using an absorbing wire.</p><p>From the peak positions and widths of the satellite peaks <ref type="bibr">( -4, -3, . . . 3, 4)</ref> the mean lateral distance cd&gt; and the lateral island-island correlation length, 5, respectively, can be evaluated.</p><p>Our preliminary experiment was successful concerning the resolution achieved. However, the photon flux at BM5 was about a factor of 10 below the flux at BW2 (HASYLAB). The discussed ordering of the islands, however, has to be measured along all azimuthal sample orientations. Moreover, the resolution has to be improved by utilising an analyser crystal. These future investigations are only possible at a beamline exhibiting a higher brilliance.</p><p>[I] M. Schmidbauer, Th.
