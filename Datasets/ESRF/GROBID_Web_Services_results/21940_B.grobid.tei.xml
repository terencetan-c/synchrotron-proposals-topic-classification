In this study we performed Mo and Co-K edge EXAFS measurements of catalyst supported on g-alumina and prepared in absence and presence of triethylene glycol (TEG). The sample containing TEG will be called CoMoPTEG/Al and the one not containing TEG will be called CoMoP/Al. All the measurements were carried out in transmission. The temperature was 77 K in order to diminish the Debye-Waller effect. Each spectrum was averaged over 3 scans in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the Mo K edge EXAFS spectra of the oxidic alumina-supported catalyst. Both spectra are typical for polymolybdate clusters. These experiments show that when glycol is present in the catalyst, the structure of the Mo clusters changes dramatically. The signal at ca. 1.7 Å (phase not corrected), due to the nearest oxygen shell, broadens; the amplitude of the signal at 3.5 Å (phase not corrected) due to Mo-Mo second coordination, increases. This might be due to the fact that glycol affects the interaction between the molybdenum precursor species and the alumina support leading to larger molybdenum clusters in which the Mo atoms are surrounded by a much more distorted octahedral shell of oxigen atoms. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the Co-K edge of the same samples. As we can see, the glycol does not affect the Co local structure. Thus we conclude that the main role of glycol is to prevent a strong interaction between molybdenum precursors and alumina support. According to TopsAEe et al. such a system can be better sulfided and leads to the most active "Co-Mo-S" type II structure. .

Usually they are prepared by pore volume impregnation of a g-alumina support with a solution containing cobalt and molybdenum salts. To activate the dried powder a further sulfiding step is required. This is done by means of flowing an 10% H 2 S/H 2 mixture over the catalyst precursor. Recently it has been proved that significant improvements of the catalytic activity are obtained when glycosidic compounds and phosphate are added during the preparation of the catalyst. It is very important to understand how these compounds interact with the active sites.</figDesc></figure>
