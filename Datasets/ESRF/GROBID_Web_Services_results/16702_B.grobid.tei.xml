<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The recent experiments on ID9, aimed at investigating picosecond diffraction from coherent phonons, achieved their primary aim with excellent results. Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the picosecond timeresolved image of the X-ray emission from single electron bunches diffracted from an (a) unperturbed InSb crystal and (b) an InSb crystal within which coherent phonons had been excited by a 100-fs laser. The length of the streak in (a) is the 100-ps electron bunch length, resolved with ~1ps resolution. The data were recorded on the ID9 sub-picosecond X-ray streak-camera. Note the pronounced oscillation in the X-ray signal in (b), directly induced by the effect of the coherent atomic oscillations on the X-ray reflectivity. These are the clearest data yet obtained observing such high-frequency phonon effects with picosecond resolution, and pave the way for a variety of novel experiments aimed at improving our understanding of picosecond ultrasonics, and methods for generating X-ray switching optics on picosecond timescales. The quality of data has been improved by intensifying the image before CCD recording, which allows us to observed the phonon oscillations at energies up to 25eV off the main Bragg peak, even under conservative intensifier conditions. In future experiments we fully expect to increase the sensitivity of the intensified picosecond camera even further, which will directly lead to the ability to observe even higher frequency (close to 1Thz) phonons, and other sub-picosecond phenomena such as non-thermal melt. The coherent phonons were observed for a range of energies, and the observed phonon freqencies were in excellent agreement with simulations based on dynamical diffraction theory coupled with a simple hydrodynamic model for the phonon dynamics within the laser-irradiated InSb crystal (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Whilst the primary experimental aims of observing clear diffraction from coherent phonons were met with excellent results, unfortunately we did not have the opportunity to specifically investigate the enhancement of such phonon modes in thin crystalline films. The primary ESRF diagnostic used for these measurements -the sub-picosecond X-ray streak camera -developed a fault at the beginning of the run, and was only available for 2 of the 8 days of HS-1122/1123. Such teething problems are not unknown with the commisioning of such state-of-the-art equipment, and the ESRF staff worked day and night to fix the problem. A great deal was learnt from this process, and we fully expect that future experiments will yield a far greater wealth of data. That said, the results we have obtained are extremely interesting. Figure 2: Observed phonon frequency as a function of deviation from Bragg peak compared with results from dynamical-diffraction-theory.</p><p>Theoretical modelling is ongoing in order to interpret the results. Our initial analysis will concentrate on the phase and delay of the oscillations of the X-rays diffracted from the phonons with respect to the laser excitation pulse (known with an accuracy of order 1 picosecond). We believe that this may well yield information on the relative roles of the fast time-scale (sub-picosecond) deformation potential and the slower electron-phonon relaxation in setting up the strain profile within the first few picoseconds of excitation. Direct information on the relative roles of these mechanisms has hitherto been illusive. Preliminary modelling of the data is being published in SPIE proceedings, and plans for further publication of this work in J. Phys. D and another journals are in progress.</p><p>Publications arising thus far from this work: "Femtosecond X-ray Diffraction: Experiments and Limits: SPIE proceedings no. 4143 (San Diego, August 2000) (to be published). + 2 papers in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Picosecond diffraction from (a) unperturbed InSb crystal and (b) from crystal within which coherent phonons have been launched by irradiation with 100-fs laser</figDesc><graphic coords="2,42.00,197.00,247.00,185.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
