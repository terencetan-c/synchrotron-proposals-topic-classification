<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>It was the aim of the experiment to prepare a clean (0001) oriented surface of the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 and to deposit submonolayer amounts of Fe followed by a thorough structure analysis by surface x-ray diffraction. Simultaneously high-energy xray photoemission (HAXPES) spectra were recorded. The experiments could be carried out successfully. Several unexpected results were obtained, one of them is discussed in the following: Dosing of Fe on the clean Bi 2 Se 3 (0001) surface at room temperature followed by mild (250°C) annealing leads to a reaction between Fe and the substrate, most likely involving an alloying of Fe with Bi. We found a complex superstructure.  Several superlattice rods (SLR's) were measured, one of them (02L) is shown in Fig.2. All SLR's show an overall similar shape along q z with a maximum at around 5 rec. latt. Units with q z referred to the Bi 2 Se 3 c-lattice constant of 28.64 Å. This maximum corresponds to an interatomic correlation of about 5.7 Å along the c-direction. The similarity of all the rods points to a simple structure. This view is also supported by the projected Patterson function, P(u,v) which is shown in Fig. 3 and which was derived from seven in-plane superlattice reflections. Apart from the trivial maximum at the origin, there is only one weak (positive) peak at (u,v)≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ (0.20, 0.50), which even might be attributed to a truncation error. In summary, we have investigated the structure of Fe deposited in monolayer amounts on the topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 . Our results suggest that there is a strong interaction between Fe and the substrate involving a thorough reorganisation of the surface structure leading to an uniaxially incommensurate superstructure. The possible formation of an alloy structure even in the bulk has been reported recently [1]. In view of the widely discussed physical properties of the Fe/Bi 2 Se 3 (0001) interface [2-4] our results rises the question whether discrepancies in the results reported so far might be attributed to the formation (reaction) of different surface structures depending on subtle differences in the sample preparation (e.g. sample temperature). The analysis of the HAXPES data is in progress. References: [1] A. Adam, Mat. Res. Bull. 42, 1986 (2007) [2] L.A. Wray, Su-Y. Xu, Y. Xia et al., Nat. Phys. 7, 32 (2010) [3] M.R. Scholz et al., Phys.
