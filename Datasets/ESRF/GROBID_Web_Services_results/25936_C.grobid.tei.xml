<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The experiments reported here are part of a PhD thesis (H. Palancher) dedicated to the methodological study by anomalous diffraction of the precise location of cations in zeolites in the presence of multi-component adsorbed phases. The industrial and scientific background is based on optimisation and development of new molecular sieves (such as X, Y or A zeolites) for high performance processes for separation and purification of hydrocarbon isomers. In such molecular sieves, adsorption properties and, more precisely, selectivity and capacity of adsorption can be correlated with the distribution of charge compensating cations. Preliminary measurements performed at room temperature, with pre-treated (dehydrated) samples (SrX and SrRbX) sealed in capillary holders have shown the strong sensitivity of AWAXS to the distributions of cations (Sr 2+ and Sr 2+ or Rb + respectively) (see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Moreover a dedicated methodology (optimisation of the beam optics, the data collection strategy and the detection system) has been established. To study in situ the variation of the cation distribution in the same samples under a variety of temperature and atmosphere compositions, an experimental set-up (based on ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) has been especially designed. Its first development has been used to characterise by in situ anomalous diffraction SrX at different steps of dehydration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Then a new heating system providing a very low temperature gradient along the sample has been inserted <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This improved set-up has enabled high quality diffraction data collection on in situ dehydrated SrRbX <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. AWAXS data refinement strategy has been developed on the dehydrated SrX sample data and its efficiency shown in the study of dehydrated SrRbX which is a particularly difficult case for X-Ray diffraction: Rb + and Sr 2+ cations have the same number of electrons <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The experiment number 02-02-610-a had three main aims. First, a study of cation distribution in SrX with water content so as to improve on the ex situ analysis of water saturated SrX. Second, investigation of the influence of cation size on cation distributions in bicationic samples with the degree of hydration by AWAXS in situ or ex situ measurements on NaRbX (r Na + = 1.02Å and r Rb + = 1.52Å), and on CaSrX (r Ca ++ = 1.00Å and r Sr ++ = 1.18Å) with analysis of competitive population of each site. Finally, we also performed tests by anomalous diffraction on dehydrated SrRbX under dynamic para xylene adsorption conditions. Cation distributions evolution due to hydrocarbon molecules adsorption has been followed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental set-up</head><p>The experimental set-up enables in situ diffraction and absorption studies in transmission mode on a powder sample held in a rotating glass capillary under controlled temperature and flushing gas of controlled composition (cf. fig. <ref type="figure">I</ref>). The gas can be charged with hydrocarbon molecules (para-xylene in this case), when it flows through hydrocarbon in liquid phase. A detailed description of the furnace and of the reaction cell can be found in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Identical experimental conditions were used for each in situ dehydration (dried N 2 used as flushing gas and sample temperature set at 250°C) until a stable state was obtained. Anomalous diffraction studies were performed at rubidium and strontium K absorption edges (respectively 15.202 and 16.106keV). High resolution diffraction patterns were recorded at two energies (10eV below considered edge and far below). For water saturated SrX, an additional dataset has been collected at intermediate energy (65eV below the Sr absorption edge).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All diffraction patterns collected on a sample for given adsorption conditions were refined simultaneously using the Fullprof software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> with non constrained site occupancies. Preliminary results show the importance of the exchange of about 18 Sr ++ in SrX by 18 Ca ++ even if those cations have the same valence and very close ionic radii (cf. table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Indeed at highest hydration degree, only 27.8 Sr ++ cations per unit cell have been localised in SrX on sites I, I' and II whereas 39.7 cations are on theses sites in CaSrX (non localised Sr ++ cations in SrX are very probably disordered in the supercage). On the other hand, Ca ++ and Sr ++ exhibit the same distributions on sites I, I' and II in CaSrX, to a first approximation, whatever the hydration level. When considering NaRbX, large differences between Na + and Rb + cation distributions are observed for the two hydration degrees (cf. table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Lack of time prevented us from performing AWAXS measurements at the Sr absorption edge on SrRbX dehydrated under para-xylene adsorption. However with data collected only at the Rb absorption edge, first refinements show interesting cation motions <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, which have to be confirmed. In conclusion, this experiment enabled us to characterise the influence of cation size on distributions in bicationic zeolites and to perform an in situ AWAXS study at Rb and Sr absorption edges.
