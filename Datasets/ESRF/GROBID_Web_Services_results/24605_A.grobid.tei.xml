<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>ESRF Small-Angle X-ray Scattering was used in order to obtain results on the evolution of the precipitation state during In-Situ aging of Fe-1.4 wt%Cu and Fe-0.8 wt%Cu alloys. The aim of this experiment was to monitor the volume fraction and Guinier radius of particles during isothermal and anisothermal agings as a function of time.</p><p>Numerous results were obtained, and we will only present selected results for Fe-1.4wt%Cu alloy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Details of the experiment :</head><p>Several heat treatments were performed :</p><p>For Isothermal In-Situ agings, samples were annealed at 845°C for 5 hours and water quenched.</p><p>For Ex-Situ characterizations, samples were annealed at 845°C for 5 hours and water quenched, followed by aging at different temperatures for a range of times. (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>For non-isothermal In-Situ agings, we have selected one of the precipitation states in table 1, and treated the sample at a higher temperature. A small angle setup was chosen to well characterize particles from 5Å to 100Å, corresponding to scattering vectors from 10 -2 to 0.2Å -1 . For each measurement, the volume fraction and Guinier radius of the particles were determined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results :</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isothermal agings</head><p>We can see in fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and 2 the evolution of particle radius and volume fraction for three different temperatures.</p><p>In-Situ aging at 500°C allows us to deduce from the very first time of the heat treatment the nucleation radius. We can also notice that the results of the In-Situ and Ex-Situ experiments are in very good agreement at 500°C. The combination of In-Situ and Ex-Situ aging gives access to the major part of the precipitation kinetics, from nucleation to coarsening.</p><p>The comparion between the three aging temperatures let us know that the nose of the Temperature-Time-Transformation curve seems to be located between 600 and 700°C for this alloy. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-isothermal agings</head><p>The In-Situ experiment is a very good tool for the study of non-isothermal aging. In this case, we have taken a sample aged 20 hours at 500°C and held it at 675, 700 and 725°C. (fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Those experiments can be divided into two parts : first, a dissolution of the precipitates at a constant mean radius (from 1 to ≈100s), and secondly growth and coarsening, where the radius is increasing and the volume fraction is reaching the equilibrium volume fraction (for long times).</p><p>It is clearly shown here that the higher the aging temperature, the greater the dissolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions :</head><p>This experiments has been very usefull and a lot of information has been recorded. We are grateful to the ESRF staff, and especially to the BM02 beam line for their help.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 1 and 2 : Evolution of particle radius and volume fraction vs. time for isothermal In-situ aging at 500°C, 600°C and 700°C, and Ex-Situ aging at 500°C.</figDesc></figure>
