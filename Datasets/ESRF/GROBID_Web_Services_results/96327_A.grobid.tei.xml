<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was designed to look at powder diffractino of plastic crystal material tetramethylammonium bromotrichloroferrite and tetraethylammonium bromotrichloroferrite.</p><p>Mixtures of these two materials were prepared and annealed before the experiment.</p><p>The experiment looked at powder diffractino as a functino of temperature between 200K and 400 K. We were able to map the distinctive mesophase transtiino temperautre as a functino of changing composition.</p><p>The data revealed a change in the abbruptness with which the transtiino was able to take place. There were also distinct changes in the solvent phase of the mixture which exhibited large lattice change sthroug hthe transition-this was observed in the form of sharp ticks in the waterfall plots as a function of temperature.</p><p>The multiple phase transntions present in the tetramethylammonium material as a functino of temperature made the mappnig of phase s vs composition rather challenging. This is still to be resolved, but the experiment itself was highly successful and ther experimental aparatus with the cryostreme temperautre control was perfect for the designed experiment.</p></div>			</div>
