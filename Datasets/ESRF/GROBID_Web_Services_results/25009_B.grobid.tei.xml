<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this study was a structural characterisation of different dye loaded, synthetic mordenite single crystals (preferred molecules sites, diorder). These dye-zeolite host-guest systems have applications as artificial antenna systems, where the dye mimic the role of chlorophyl in natural plants. Different dyes have been incorporated in various zeolites [1] (zeolite L, zeolite Y, and ZSM-5), but little is known about geometrical arrangement of the dyes in the zeolite channels. In a preceding experiment (01-02-609) a data set of a thionine-loaded mordenite crystal was measured at room temperature. Although the orthorhombic symmetry of mordenite already limits disorder of the enclosed molecules, the structural refinement of thionine-mordenite showed distinct disorder of the organic molecule along axis of the large 12-membered ring channel. To obtain more reliable structural data, experimental settings were modified: (1) diffraction data of dye loaded mordenite single crystals were collected at 120 K to reduce disorder effects, (2) data of selenium-modified mordenite sample was measured (also at 120 K) to compare Se-sites in the mordenite channels with S-sites of the sulphur containing dye molecules. Cationic thionine blue C 12 H 9 N 3 S + , methylene blue C 16 H 18 N 3 S + , DAMS C 16 H 19 N 2 + have been used for dye incoporation by ion exchange [2]. Elemental selenium and sulphur was induced in Na-mordenite by gas phase.</p></div>

Data collection was performed in dose mode for all crystals at room temperature with a wavelength of 0.7995 Å using the MAR image plate. All samples were cooled at 120 K by an conventional liquid-N2 divice during the data colletion. All structures were refined in space group Cc.</p><p>Structural study of Se-modified Na-mordenite is submitted to "Microporous mesoporous materials" [3]: Abstract: "Single crystals of self-synthesized mordenite-Na were used for incorporation of elemental selenium. The mordenite sample was first dehydrated at 280 ºC and selenium was subsequently incorporated as gas-phase at 450 ºC until mordenite changed colour to bright orange. Se-loaded mordenite was quantitatively determined by electron-microprobe analyses yielding Na 6 Al 6 Si 42 O 96 × [Se 7.9 ]. X-ray data collection of mordenite-Na and Se-loaded mordenite-Na single-crystals were performed at 120 K with synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.79946 Å) using the single-crystal diffraction line at SNBL (ESRF, Grenoble) where diffracted intensities were registered with a MAR image plate. The structures of both mordenite-Na and Se-mordenite-Na were refined in monoclinic space group Cc converging at R1 = 5.25% (mordenite-Na) and R1 = 6.65% (Se-mordenite-Na). A strongly broadened Raman band at ca. 254 cm -1 confirmed the existence of Se-chains in the 12-membered channels along the c-axis.</p><p>Several, low-populated, disordered Se chains with a length up to 10 Å and 7 Se atoms were located in the large mordenite channel. During structure refinement nearest and next nearest neighbor Se-Se distances were fixed at 2.33 Å and 3.62 Å, respectively. Other distances and angles remained unconstrained. Because of electrostatic interaction with the framework and influence of extraframework occupants such as Na + and H 2 O molecules, the chains show different geometrical Se arrangement with highly variable dihedral angles. Any other Se species such as Se 6 or Se 8 rings were neither confirmed by structure refinement nor by Raman spectroscopy. There was no indication of a trigonal Se chain geometry within the 12-membered ring channel." Dye-loaded mordenite samples:</p><p>The unit cell constants of all dye-loaded structures showed a significant change due to the molecule incorporation. All incorporated dye molecules have similar dimensions (15 -17 Å length, 7 Å height).</p><p>Compared with the channel aperture (6.5 x 7 Å), this allows only a limited position for the molecules in the 12-membered channel. Because the mordenite framework is flexible to a certain degree, the unit cell is expanded in a-direction and shortened in b-direction. The easiest way to localize the molecule site in the channel is to determine the position of the sulfphur site, which is the heaviest atom within the molecule (thionine, methylene blue). By comparision of the difference fourier map of the 12-membered ring channel section down the c-axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ), it is obvious that the S atom has a similar position as the selenium sites in the Se-modified mordenite <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. A highlighted on the thionin molecule, it is obvious that the molecule has 3 degrees of freedom to rotated within the channel, if the sulphur site is assumed as fixed: (1) rotation around the a-axis, (2) rotation around the b-axis and (3) rotation around the c-axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Maximal rotation angles are limited by the channel wall oxygens. Despite of this limitation, a slight rotation of about 10º in each direction is possible resulting in disorder and less defined sites of the other molecule atoms. Additionally disorder along the channel axis is also observed.  [1] Calzaferri G., Pauchard M., Maas H., Huber S., Khatyr A., Schaafsma T. (2001) J. Mater.
