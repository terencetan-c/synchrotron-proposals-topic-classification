<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Encouraging results were obtained although the experiment could not be accomplished before the end of the run. A lot of time was used to align both the samples within the cryostat, as well as the optic on the beamline, like the phase plate, with a great involvement of the local contact. A major difficulty that had to be overcome was that most of the reflections of interest were very hard to reach due to the use of the "Orange" cryostat. First the reciprocal space accessible was reduced because of the relatively short wavelength at the Mn K-edge. Second, the sample was a thin film, which required performing diffraction in reflective mode. With such cryostat it was impossible to use the chi rotation, a limitation that was overcome thanks to the beamline scientist suggesting to push beyond the software limit of the detection rotation (2th), at some point during the experiment.</p><p>It also appeared that one of the samples appeared to have no Manganite film on the substrate and was removed maybe prematurely. Lot of time was used to align it and characterized it until the absence of Mn fluorescence convinced everybody to pass to another sample. However, the absence of the manganite film has then been checked again after the experiment with a contradicting result, because its actual presence was confirmed by crystallography and micro analysis FESEM. There is no explanation as to why the Mn fluorescence was not detected.</p><p>Nevertheless, one sample was eventually perfectly aligned under the beam, and the application of the current could be performed. We found very small superstructure reflections that were incommensurate with the lattice. This was the first success of the experiment. The spectral signature was recorded. Unfortunately the use of the Orange cryostat could not allowed azimuthal scans which precluded the enhancement of the resonant signal. The transport properties has been measured, unfortunately a contact has been lost at some point of the experiment precluding to follow the structural properties of the film under applied field.</p><p>In conclusion, the beamline ID20 was perfect to perform the experiment except that the cryostat needed for this experiment was not available, and the experiment ended up being very challenging, although possible, with the orange cryostat.</p><p>We will request further beamtime, deeply regretting with its staff that ID20 and its activity has to be shut down.</p><p>We thank the remarkable assistance of the ID20 staff.</p></div>		</body>
