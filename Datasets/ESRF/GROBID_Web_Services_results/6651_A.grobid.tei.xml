<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>First order phase transition in the liquid phases have recently been shown to occur in a number of elements and compounds such as tellurium, selenium, bismuth, tin and gallium antimonide <ref type="bibr">[l]</ref>. The existence of a liquid-liquid phase transition in HgTe had been postulated previously <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> and supported by a recent X-ray diffraction study <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. To understand the transformation processes, precise density variations at the transitions are indispensable. In this study we applied a new method for density measurements[4] and combined it with the intense, high-energy X-ray at ESRF. $'he absorption experiments were carried out using a large-volume Paris-Edinburgh press on IDZ07BL2 at ESRF. The energy of x-ray was 65 keV and the size of the x-ray beam was 0. lmm x 0. lmm. The incident and transmitted X-ray intensities, I and 10, respectively, were measured by photodiodes. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a schematic diagram of the sample container. To keep the sample shape cylindrical, the sample was confined in a ruby cylinder, 0.5 mm i.d. and 1.0 mm O.-d. We measured the x-ray absorption as a function of sample position, x, and then fitted the data using the following formula:</p><p>Illo=CSbeamexp(-U,Pf(x))dr, f(x)==(?qx-xo)2)1n with: C, a constant, ILL, the mass absorption coefficient of the sample, P , the density of the sample, I(x), the length of the path in the sample, r, diameter of the sample, ~0, sample center. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows an example of the measurements on liquid bismuth(Bi). The circles indicate the experimental data and the line indicates the result of a parameter fitting. We. can clearly see the image of the sample shape. The fitting well reproduces the position dependence of the absorption. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the temperature dependence of the density of Bi at 1 GPa. A sudden change of density between 180 "C and 24O"C corresponds to the melting. The positive jump at the melting is consistent to the negative slope of the melting curve (dZ'ddp&lt;O) From the slope in the solid and liquid phases we can evaluate the thermal expansion coefficients of Bi at 1GPa to be 3 x 10m5 K' for solid and 1.2 x 10" K-' for liquid. These values are close to the values at ambient pressure, 4 x 10" K' for solid and 1 .I x 10" R' for liquid. Further data analysis is now in progress. Unfortunately the density measurements on HgTe were not satisfactory because they were done before optimizations of the experimental setups.</p><p>The quality of the data is much better than the previous experiments at Photon <ref type="bibr">Factory[4]</ref>. The present result shows that it is now possible to measure densities of disordered phases under high-pressure and high-temperature at ESRF. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure2shows an example of the measurements on liquid bismuth(Bi).

The present result shows that it is now possible to measure densities of disordered phases under high-pressure and high-temperature at ESRF. [l] A.G.Umnov et al., J.Phys.: Cond.
