<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>It has been discovered that manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) can be used to trace neuronal connections activated following specific stimulation. These studies used manganese (Mn) as a contrast agent. The biological basis for the movement of Mn 2+ into tissues and its cellular distribution are still unclear. A major drawback to the use of Mn 2+ as a contrast agent is its cellular toxicity. Indeed, non specific enhancement contributes to MEMRI. This raise the need to better depict the quantitative Mn distribution at cellular scale a critical issue for the development of MEMRI, particularly to identify the brain cells targeted with Mn from which results increaseMRI contrast, in order to increase sensitivity so that lower doses of Mn 2+ can be used and to drive the development of new Mn-based contrast agents.</p><p>November 2009: 9 shifts on ID21. 1shift ½ lost due to general ESRF file server failure.</p><p>The ID21 KirkPatrick-Baez focusing sytems was not available (problems on mirors) and Zone plate was used at 7.2 keV; (spot size achieved 0.2 x 0.9 mm) with a flux of 3.10 +9 e.g a factor 10 or 20 less than wit h KB optic. All animals that receive MnCl 2 via various route of administration were imaged at MRI platform prior brains cryosectioning were analysed on synchrotror. Rat brain sections were 20 microns in thickness . Olfactory bulb cryosections for animals that receive intranasal exposition to MnCl 2 were possible to analysed first with scanning larger region with 50 microns pinhole and then on smaller region of interest using the zone plate. Integration time wasextremely long due to combined low flux available and to the very low content of Mn estimated of few ppm only despite injection with MnCl 2 ; and few tenth ppm in the olfactory bulb.</p><p>January 2010: 15 shifts on ID18F</p><p>The set-up used was at 14 keV excitation with the 3 undulators of ID18 beamline and Aluminium compound refractive lenses used for ID18F. This result in a flux of around 2. 10 +10 . The integration was 10 s per pixel and 20 micron step was used with the objective of mapping most of the hippocampus. This was achieved for only 2 control and 2 intraperitoneal; 1 intraveneous and intracranial injected animals.</p><p>The work carried out by the PhD student is already important on the side of in vivo Mn-MRI protocol for imaging and immunohistological processing. But Mn concentration despite exgeneous injection of MnCl 2 and clear MRI signal, Mn is fairly low in hippocampus (2-3 ppm.) and olfactory bulb. Consequently, the synchrotron results due to the low photon flux achieve on ID21 and ID18F and some technical problems encountered could not bring the necessary results in order to make correlative images (MRI, histology, synchrotron XRF). As mention, best results were obtained at low spatial resolution on large zone at ID18F. These studies are very relevant and informative so far the hippocampus was scarcely investigated for trace element content and for first time here for Mn as neuronal contrast agent.This allow us to choose one injection modality for a final study that would required another much higher flux beamline ID22.Indeed, in order to identify the cells implicated in Mn storage compared to control, ID22 seems to us the only beamline possible to achieve simultaneously 1-5 micrometer beamsize with high flux (5.10+11 ph/s) that would allow to reach for Mn ppm sensitivity within 1-2 sec counting time. That are the reason of re-applying for beamtime on this project to allow the PhD student Alexia Daoust to reach the goal of the project (correlative imaging and cellular Mn location compared to MRI contrasted areas) and to publish it (This is not possible actually from the data we already processed).
