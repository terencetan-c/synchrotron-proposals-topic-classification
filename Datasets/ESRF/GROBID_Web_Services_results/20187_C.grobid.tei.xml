Dong* Aldolase</p><p>As part of our program to probe the mechanism of the aldolase and to direct evolution of novel substrate profiles of KDPG aldolase we collected the following data KDPG-aldolase from Thermotoga maritinum crystallises in space-group P2 1 with two trimeric molecules in the assymetric unit. The protein is from a thermophile thus making it more useful for synthetic use. The monoclinic angle has a value of 92º, which made the symmetry of these crystals not obvious at first. This was our first attempt to collect diffraction data of this protein, so the space-group and conditions for cryo-protection were not known at the start of this diffraction experiment. Luckily, cryo-protection could easily be achieved by briefly washing crystals in a mixture of 8 µl of mother liquor from the crystal plate with 2 µl of 75 % (v/v) PEG 600. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.2 Å, but unfortunately the exposure time had to be reduced in the middle of the experiment to to time constraints. The data given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> is complete to 3.0 Å.. The structure has been solved using the molecular replacement programs AMORE and BEAST with the trimeric KDPG-aldolase from E. coli (PDB-entry 1EUA). This protein has a sequence identity of approx. 30 % and molecular replacement thus did not give very clear solutions. Refinement of the structure was greatly aided by exploiting the sixfold noncrystallographic symmetry of the assymetric unit. A ribbon representation of the KDPG-aldolase trimer is shown in Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Ribbon representation of KDPG-aldolase from Thermotoga maritinum</head><p>Crystals of 2 mutants of KDPG aldolase from E.coli were brought to Grenoble in sitting drop plates. Crystal diffraction quality varies considerably across any given set of crystals therefore a large number of crystals were screened before one of suitable quality and resolution was found. One crystal of a multiple mutant from Professor Wong's labaoratory did diffract. The multiple mutant is of interest because it has a reversed sterochemistry of substrate addition. The crystal measured (0.7 mm x 0.25 mm x 0.20 mm) and diffracted to 2.3Å. A complete dataset was collected on the crystal consisting of 342 frames, the crystal having been exposed for 30s per frame at a distance of 150 mm. The data was processed onsite with Molsflm and scaled with Scala. Details in</p><p>Table 2 below Temperature 110 K % completeness 98% No. reflections 28060 Resolution 2.3Å Space group C2 Cell</p><p>161x122x88 Data was molecular replaced with aMoRe using native KDPG aldolase (from E.coli) as a model. This gave a solution which had a trimer in the asymmetric unit which is consistent with other data. The data is being refined with Refmac5 and currently has an Rfree of 26%. Methylaspartase 3-Methylaspartase (ß-methylaspartase, BMA; E.C. 4.3.1.2) catalyses the reversible anti-elimination of ammonia from L-threo-(2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid to give mesaconic acid. The reverse reaction is of particular interest because it can be exploited to generate highly functionalised L-amino acids. As 3-methylaspartase from Clostridium tetanomorphum shows only low sequence relationship to known structures from the Protein Data Bank, the structure was solved by exploiting the anomalous signal of Sesubstituted crystals using data collected at the peak wavelength on BM14 in another experiment. In addition we collected a native data set to 1.9 Å on ID14EH2 with the statistics given below in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. The structure has in the meantime been refined using a hybrid warpNtrace/manual model building approach. A ribbon representation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>
