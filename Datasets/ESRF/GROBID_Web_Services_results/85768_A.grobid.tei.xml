<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our 6 shifts of beam time at ID02 we investigated DNA origami superstructure crystals including guest gold nanoparticles with SAXS. In addition, we studied DNA origami objects freely dispersed in aqueous solution and DNA-containing lipid nanoparticles. Prior to the experiment we assembled DNA origami crystals with guest particles of different size in annealing reactions. The lattice polymerization of two precursor solutions, kept at room temperature and 47 °C, respectively, was studied in situ.</p><p>We used an X-ray energy of 12.4 keV, a beam size of 0.2x0.3 mm 2 and a sample-to-detector distance (SDD) of 3 m. For selected samples we recorded additional detector images at 1 m and 10 m SDD. The sample environment was a 1.5 mm quartz glass flow-through cell kept at 23°C by a Peltier thermostat coupled to a 40°C water bath. To study the disassembly of the DNA origami crystals and their monomeric units when heating, the samples were exposed in situ to temperature ramps up to 78°C. The in situ polymerization experiments of precursor solutions as well as the lipid nanoparticle studies were done in 2 mm quartz glass capillaries (Hilgenberg , Malsfeld, Germany). A Rayonix MX-170HS CCD detector was used with a binning of 960x960 pixels of 0.177 mm size. All samples showed isotropic scattering so the radially averaged intensity curves provided in real time were used for further analysis.</p><p>As preliminary experiments, water, TAE buffer containing MgCl 2 , 10 nm gold nanoparticle stock solution (EM.GC10, BBI International) and rectangular DNA origami blocks were measured to choose the exposure times. Typical exposure times ranged between 10x0.05s for gold-containing samples prone to aggregation upon X-ray exposure and 10x0.5s for bare DNA constructs.</p><p>Firstly, bare DNA origami crystals and their corresponding monomers were measured and molten by heating ramps. The lattice structure determined by the molecular design was confirmed. It was found that melting occurs just above the optimal assembly temperature. DNA origami lattices with 10 and 20 nm guest gold nanoparticles as well as gold nanorods were measured, molten and compared to SAXS intensities of the individual components.</p><p>Secondly, lipid nanoparticles containing single-and double-stranded DNA were measured. Thirdly, freely dispersed DNA origami objects with different guest particle geometries were investigated and confirmed previous particle distance measurements.</p><p>In regular time intervals throughout the whole experiment the two precursor mixtures for DNA origami crystals at 47°C and room temperature were placed in the beam and crystal formation was observed. The resulting assembly quality was better at 47°C. A detailed analysis of the obtained SAXS intensities of the DNA origami crystals, their melts, and their components will allow a better understanding of the DNA crystal formation and disintegration. Due to the low background of the flow-through cell and the high q resolution crystallite sizes and lattice parameters can be derived without additional assumptions about the shape of the components. The extracted characteristic temperatures of melting and growth serve to optimize future design protocols of DNA origami crystal monomers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Bert NICKEL*, Caroline HARTL*, Kilian FRANK*, Martina OBER* Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich, Faculty of Physics Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 1, 80539 Munich, Germany</figDesc></figure>
