Nevertheless, a value E 2 -1 of 0.732 confirmed the assumption of a non centric space group as supposed from NMR spectra. Attempts to solve the structure by direct space strategy were undertaken by using FOX in the P 4 2 b c space group, choosing the parallel tempering algorithm. First, fourteen independent fragments (7 PO 4 tetrahedra, 2 organic DAE molecules and 5 Al atoms) were considered, using random starting positions, however the computational search did not to converge towards a reliable solution. Then we made the hypothesis that at least, one phosphate should be connected to four alumina (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and the strategy was to use this "secondary building unit", six PO 4 , one aluminium atom and two organic moieties, put randomly in the unit cell at the starting stage. The calculations converged in almost 48 hours to a layered framework where only two alumina of the PO 4 Al 4 unit should be moved to increase their connectivity towards phosphate groups. The corresponding atomic coordinates were used as the starting model in the Rietveld refinement, which converged to R wp = 0.199, confirming the validity of the hypothesis. Fourier difference calculations (SHELXTL) allowed then the location of the free water molecules. The final Rietveld refinement carried out in the angular ranges 3-55°(2θ) used 2371 reflections and involved 152 atomic coordinates. It corresponds to satisfactory crystal structure model indicators (R B = 0.055) and profile factors (Rp = 0.062). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the final fit obtained between calculated and observed patterns.

Aluminum atoms adopt the three possible coordinations: tetrahedra, trigonal bipyramid and octahedra. Three of the seven independent phosphate groups are connected to four alumina whereas the four others possess terminal oxygen or terminal hydroxyl pointing to the interlayer space. The triple layer can be described from heptamers Al 3 P 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) connected two by two directly via the hydroxyl and via four phosphate groups for generating 7 membered rings. These dimmers of heptamers are then connected via two phosphates to form chains running along a or b (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). The connectivity of the chains to form layers is insured by AlO 4 , generating 8 and 6 membered rings (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). The cohesion of successive layers is insured directly by strong hydrogen bonds between phosphates. The two amines and the water molecules reinforce the threedimensionality of the structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of (1) can be described from [Al 10 (PO 4 ) 9 (PO 3 OH) 5 (OH)] -8 layers perpendicular to the c axis.
