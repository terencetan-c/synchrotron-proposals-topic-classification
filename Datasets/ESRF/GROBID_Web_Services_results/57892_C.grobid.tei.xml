<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We use resonant elastic and inelastic X-ray scattering at Ir-L3 edge on ID20 of ESRF to study the doping-dependent magnetic order, magnetic excitations and spin-orbit excitons in the bilayer iridate (Sr1-xLax)3Ir2O7 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.065). With increasing doping x, the three-dimensional (3D) long range antiferromagnetic order (LAF) is gradually suppressed and evolves into a short range order (SAF) from x = 0 to 0.05, followed by a transition from 3D SAF to 2D SAF between x = 0.05 and 0.065. Following the evolution of the antiferromagnetic order, the magnetic excitations undergo damping, anisotropic softening and gap collapse. From the lack of c-axis magnetic correlations in x = 0.065, we conclude that electron doping suppresses the interlayer couplings and drives (Sr1-xLax)3Ir2O7 into a 2D SAF correlated metallic state hosting strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Meanwhile, the spinorbit excitons at (½, 0) decrease in energy by ~70 meV across the transition from 3D to 2D SAF, suggesting that magnetic correlations are crucial for stabilizing the Mott gap.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> describes the doping evolution of the magnetic order. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) is a schematic magnetic and electronic phase diagram of (Sr1-xLax)3Ir2O7. The doping levels x measured at T = 30 K are indicated by red circles. We have measured the magnetic Bragg peaks along [H, ½, 28] and [½, ½, L] for x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.065 using the elastic channel of the RIXS spectrometer. The L scan for x = 0 displays magnetic Bragg peaks from L = 19 to 28 with an intensity modulation, in agreement with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Upon electron doping, the 3D LAF persists for x = 0.02 but becomes short ranged for x = 0.05, as indicated by the broad peaks along both H and L in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>) and 1(d). The L scan for the metallic x = 0.05 sample reveals a broad feature superimposed on a flat background, and is well fitted by a sum of the bilayer antiferromagnetic structural factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and a constant background [green solid curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>]. The presence of this broad feature indicates that the magnetic correlation length along c axis has decreased to a very small value comparable with the bilayer distance. This hints that the c-axis magnetic correlations supporting the G-type AFM are on the verge of disappearing, although the interlayer coupling is still present. The constant background can be attributed to a vanishing of the 3D SAF in a partial volume of the sample. This is in agreement with the percolative nature of the IMT, assuming that charge carriers are suppressing the magnetic order. For x = 0.065, the L scan becomes featureless while the broader in-plane magnetic Bragg peak remains and persists at 290K [Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>) and <ref type="bibr">1(d)</ref>]. This indicates that further doping destroys the interlayer couplings that support the 3D SAF and drives the system into a robust 2D SAF state. This corroborates our explanation of the L scan for x = 0.05.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the dopingdependent magnetic excitations and the spin-orbit excitons. The in-plane momentum dependent RIXS for x = 0, 0.02 and 0.065 are shown as color maps in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a)-(c</ref>). For x = 0, the overall dispersion, large magnon gap and spectral-weight distribution are consistent with a previous report measured at the same L <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In addition, our results reveal clear dispersive spin-orbit excitons. With increasing La concentration, the magnetic excitations are damped: they broaden in energy and decrease in intensity. The intensity and dispersion of the magnetic excitations exhibit a strong doping dependence [Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>]. The dispersions are symmetric about (1/4, 1/4) and change less from x = 0 to x = 0.03. Across the IMT to x = 0.05, the dispersion becomes asymmetric with a different gap size at (1/2, 1/2) and (0, 0). A substantial softening occurs along (1/2, 1/2)-(1/4, 1/4) while the band top at (1/2, 0) remains unchanged. This anisotropic softening is followed by a further softening at (1/4, 1/4) and, surprisingly, a sizable hardening at (1/2, 0) in x = 0.065 [Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>]. Furthermore, the large magnon gap in x &gt; 0.05 collapses dramatically in x = 0.065, where the magnetic excitations at (1/2, 1/2) overlap with the elastic magnetic scattering, whereas a weak signal is observed at (0, 0).</p><p>We have extracted the magnon dispersions and fitted the dispersions according to the bilayer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the J-J2-J3 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the quantum dimer model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The detailed analysis and related discussions have been described in our manuscripte 'X. Lu et al., arxiv:1608.06208'. A comparison between our results and La doped Sr2IrO4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> indicates that the doped itinerant electrons suppress the AFM by weakening the magnetic couplings and drive the system into a 2D SAF correlated metallic state hosting strong AFM spin fluctuations. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (a) Schematic phase diagram of (Sr 1-x La x ) 3 Ir 2 O 7.
