<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>has a strong activity on hydrogen storage materials, involving many national and international collaborators. The strong position of the group is to a high degree owing to the good access to neutrons for powder neutron diffraction (PND) using the diffractometer PUS at the Institute's research reactor JEEP II.</p><p>Synchrotron power X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) is an invaluable supplement to PND due to the superior speed and resolution. The data acquisition times are typically 3 orders of magnitude shorter using the MAR345 image plate at BM01A compared to PUS. This allows in-situ investigations of chemical reactions that we cannot possible follow with PND. The very high resolution offered at BM01B allows indexing and space group determination from complex structures where the problem with peak overlapping makes the task unmanageable with PND-or laboratory PXD data.</p><p>Thus, the predictable, long-term access to the beam lines at SNBL through the long-term projects 01-01-745 and 01-02-772, has been an invaluable supplement to our neutron diffraction facilities and the rest of our experimental activity.</p><p>a One experimental session (15 shifts) for the long-term project 01-01-745 remains and will be performed in 5-10 March 2009.</p></div>

Deuterated LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 was synthesised by ball milling LiAlD 4 and MgCl 2 , yielding a mixture of poorly crystalline LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 and LiCl. Purer (~10wt% LiCl), well-crystalline LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 was obtained by recrystallization in diethyl ether.</p><p>High-resolution SR-PXD data were collected at BM01B and used for indexing and space group determination (a = 8.37113(16) Å, b = 8.73910(17) Å, c = 14.3012(3) Å and β = 124.8308(8)°, space group P2 1 /c). The data were used in combination with high-resolution PND data from the PUS diffractometer at the JEEP II reactor (Kjeller, Norway) for ab-inito structure determination using the global optimization approach. The structure model was refined by according to the Rietveld method (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fluorine-substitution in Na 3 AlD 6</head><p>Metal-substitution is widely used in intermetallic metal hydrides to alter the properties. Complex hydrides, on the other hand, show very limitied possibilitis for cation substitution. However, we have found that fluoride anions can substitute hydrogen anions in Na 3 AlH 6 . The anion-substituted phase was produced by hydrogenating a mixture NaF and Al catalysed with TiF 3 .</p><p>The product was characterized by high-resolution SR-PXD at BM01B and PND with the PUS diffractometer. The data show that that a phase which is isostructural to Na 3 AlD 6 and Na 3 AlF 6 was formed. Due to the excellent scattering contrast between D and F with X-rays and the visability of D for the neutrons, the structure and composition, Na 3 AlD 1.95 F 4.05 could be reliably refined. There is no indication of long-range ordering between the F and D. Quantitative phase analysis showed that the sample contained about 33w% of the anionsubstituted alane.</p><p>PCT measurement has shown that the anion-substitution has a pronounced destabilizing effect compared to pure Na 3 AlD 6 .</p><p>The results are published in Journal of Physical Chemistry C <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. CaB 2 H 2 -an intermediate decomposition product from Ca(BH 4 ) 2 Ca(BH 4 ) 2 is considered as an attractive hydrogen storage material due to high gravimetric capacity and expected thermodynamic properties suitable for mobile hydrogen storage applications. However, the decomposition route of this compound is unclear and appears to be highly dependent on the experimental conditions.</p><p>In samples partly decomposed in our home laboratory "Temperature Programmed Desorption" (TPD) set-up, we have observed formation of an intermediate phase which is not observed in our recent in-situ SR-PXD measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The phase appears during the first decomposition step of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 . A sample which was rich in this intermediate phase, was produced by stopping the TPD right after the first desorption step (370 °C) and quickly cool to room temperature. The sample was measured with high-resolution SR-PXD at BM01B and the data could be indexed according to the orthorhombic unit cell a = 12.81 Å, b = 4.08 Å, c = 3.90 Å. The extinction rules pointed to the space groups Pnna or Pbna. However, no structure solution succeeded in these space groups. Due to the high number of possible space groups with less systematic abscent, a search for isostructural phases with similar unit cell and reasonable stoichiometry was performed in the ICSD database. A model based on the HgCl 2type structure (space group Pnma) yielded a superior fit to the experimental data compared to all other evaluated structure types.</p><p>Rietveld refinement of the with Ca and B alone (substituted for Hg and Cl, respectively) yielded a satisfactory fit to the SR-PXD data. Two hydrogen positions where located by Difference Fourier Mapping, indicating a total composition CaB 2 H 2 .</p><p>The structure model is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. It consists of layers Ca atoms which are separated by alternating B layers and layers with infinite BH 2 -chains. The chains consist of direct -B-H-B-H-links with a terminal H on each boron atom. This is a structural feature which is not reported in any other B-H containing phases and should thus be confirmed with neutron diffraction. However, do to the strong absorption in natural boron and incoherent scattering from natural hydrogen, a double isotope substituted sample, Ca 11 B 2 D 2 sample must be prepared. This work is in progress.</p><p>The results are published in Journal of Materials Chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.  The crystal structure of LiSc(BH 4 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> A new mixed borohydrides, LiSc(BH 4 ) 3 was synthesized at Hawaii University. Lab-PXD data revealed a highly crystalline product with no resemblance to any phases in the PDF-4. The data could be indexed according to a cubic unit cell with a = 6.08 Å. However, the superior resolution at BM01B revealed a slight but significant peak splitting, indicating lower symmetry (see inset in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The pattern was successfully indexed with a pseudo-cubic tetragonal unit cell, a = 6.076 Å and c = 12.034 Å. The crystal structure was solved and refined in space group P-42c (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>)</p><p>The structure consist of a Sc(BH4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> -complex anions with tehtrahedral coordination of 4 BH 4 around Sc. The Li ions where found to be highly disordered and the Li position had to be splitt in two half-occupied positions to get a good agreement with SR-PXD data in the Rietveld refinement (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>). It is suspected that the disorder is dynamic and thus that LiSc(BH 4 ) 4 is a Li-ion conductor.</p><p>The results are published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry A <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. a b c Figure 7 Refined structure of LiSc(BH 4 ) 4 . Large green balls -Sc, tetrahedra -BH 4 , red and white ballshalf-occupied Li sites. Crystal structure of Mg 2 (Fe 0.5 Co 0.5 )D 5.5 Magnesium hydride, MgH 2 , has an attractive gravimetric hydrogen content of 7.6 w%H, but is too stable for most hydrogen storage purposes. Magnesium-based transition-metal complex hydrides, e.g. Mg 2 NiH 4 , Mg 2 FeH 6 and Mg 2 CoH 5 , have more favourable thermodynamics at the expense of lower gravimertric hydrogen content (3.6-5.5 w%H in the given examples).</p><p>The volumetric hydrogen density is superb. Mg 2 FeH 5 contains 150 g H /liter, which is the highest density in known hydrogen storage materials.</p><p>A mixed complex hydride, Mg 2 (Fe 0.5 Co 0.5 )D 5.5 , was prepared by ball milling a 1:1 mixture of Mg 2 FeD 6 and Mg 2 CoD 5 . A homogeneous cubic face, isostructural to Mg 2 FeH 6 , was confirmed by SR-PXD at BM01B. No traces of tetragonal Mg 2 CoH 5 were detected, but small amounts of FeCo solid solution were present.</p><p>The crystal structure was refined with the SR-PXD data and PND data from PUS (JEEPII) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). The structure is very similar to Mg 2 FeD 6 and the high-temperature phase of Mg 2 CoD 5 which constitute fcc packing of FeD 6 octahedra and CoD 5 sqaure pyramids (randomly oriented), respectively. Mg is found in all tetrahedral interstices. The transition metals are randomly distributed over the fcc sites in Mg 2 (Fe 0.5 Co 0.5 )D 5.5 . The coordination of the fcc site was refined as a octahedron with 5/6 th of a deuterium atom in each corner. This is interpreted as a random distribution of FeD 6 octahedra and CoD 5 square pyramids since the square pyramid is essentially an octahedron with one missing corner. As in the hightemperature phase of Mg 2 CoD 5 , the there is no long-range correlations in the orientation of the square pyramids.</p><p>The results are accepted for publication in Nanotechnology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The crystal structure of Ca(AlD 4 ) 2</p><p>The existence of Ca(AlH 4 ) 2 has been known for some time, but it has proven difficult to synthesis the solvent-free phase by wet chemical methods. Solvent free Ca(AlD 4 ) 2 was prepared by ball milling CaD 2 and AlD 3 in the proper stoichiometric ratio.</p><p>The product was measured my high-resolution SR-PXD (BM01B) and PND (PUS, JEEPII). A structure predicted from DFT calculations was taken as the starting point for combined Rietveld refinement. The predicted orthorhombic Ca(BF 4 ) 2 -type structure was basically confirmed (a = 13.4491(27) Å b = 9.5334(19) Å c = 9.0203(20) Å, space group Pbca). The Ca atom is coordinated by 8 D from 8 different AlD 4 -ions in a square antiprismatic way. The overall structure is layered, with empty plans parallel to the bc-plane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>).</p><p>A manuscript is in the final state of preparation and will be submitted to Inorganic Chemsitry.  Li 2 ND Li 2 NH (lithium imide) is an intermediate product in several reactions considered for hydrogen storage. Its crystal structure is not unambiguously determined. The most thorough investigation was performed by Balogh et al by SR-PXD and PND on a deuterated sample, Li 2 ND. They found 3 structure models, one disordered cubic (a ~ 10 Å) and two ordered orthorhombic (pseudo-cubic), which described the experimental data equally well. Above ca. 90°C, the phase took a (more) disordered face-centered cubic structure (a ~5 Å).</p><p>A double isotope substituted lithium imide sample, 7 Li 2 ND, was prepared to clarify the roomtemperature structure. 7 Li was used due to its far smaller absorption cross section for neutrons than natural Li. PND (PUS, JEEPII) show several weak peaks that are inconsistent with cubic symmetry. SR-PXD measurements at BM01B were collected at room temperature and 100°C. The 100°C pattern could be indexed according a small cubic unit cell with unit cell axes of half of that suggested by Balogh et al (a ~ 5 Å). The RT pattern is noticeably different in two aspects: 1) there are additional peaks and 2) the cubic peaks are split into multiplets. The first point indicates an enlargement of the unit cell and the second point indicates lattice deformation. None of the unit cells suggested previously are consistent with the present data. Supplementary PND data from PUS show the same additional peaks, but with higher relative intensity as the SR-PXD data. Structure determination is in progress. </p></div>

Upper and lower tick marks show Bragg peaks from LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 and LiCl, respectively. Both Li and Mg were found to be octahedrally coordinated by D atoms from six different AlD 4 tetrahedra. Thus, the crystal structure of LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3 can be regarded as a cornersharing network of LiD 6 and MgD 6 octahedra and AlD 4 tetrahedra. Moreover, the AlD 4 form a distorted hexagonal close-packed lattice, which thus have Li or Mg in 2/3 of the octahedral interstices. execute A mixture of LiMgAlD 6 and Al was prepared by thermal decomposition of LiMg(AlD 4 ) 3.
