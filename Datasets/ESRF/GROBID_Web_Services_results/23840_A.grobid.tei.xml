<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed</head><p>A) X-ray absoption near the K-edge of phosphorus (l k = 5.76 Å, E k = 2152 keV) A photo diode was used to measure the primary beam attenuation. The samples for transmission measurements need to be thin: the penetration depth of 5.7 Å photons in water solutions (and organic material) is 20 µm. Both proteins studied have about 1 P atom per 50 kD protein. At 40% hydration (as it is the case for the crystal of threonine synthase) a change of the transmission by 1% is expected at the peak absorption. Protein solutions had to be dried. A drop of the solution was deposited on a 6 µm Mylar foil and left to dry for a couple of hours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples measured:</head><p>(NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 , embedded in cellulose acetate, thickness of film: 37 µm , 1 scan Pyrodoxal phosphate (PLP) several samples,1 scan each Threonine synthase (TS) containing PLP 20 scans out of 21 were successful Cystathionine-ß-lyase (CBL) containing PLP 4 scans out of 7 were successful</p><p>The absorption spectra are shown on figure 2. All spectra show an absorption peak at 2153 eV. The (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 gives a much more intense spectrum due to its higher concentration. Although the spectrum of PLP in threonine synthase appears to be different from that of PLP in Cystathionine-ß-lyase at energies above the edge, this observation would need to be confirmed by more accurate data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B) Diffraction measurements near the K-edge of phosphorus:</head><p>The influence of absorption is also visible in multi-wavelengths diffraction experiments. For the purpose of an EXAFS (here the term XANES would be more appropriate) measurement, the anomalous dispersion would have to be taken at a reasonably large number of wavelengths. The absorption spectrum would correspond to the average dispersion of the diffracted intensity. Crystals of threonine synthase available showed no sign of diffraction. The last three hours of beam time were used for test experiments of X-ray diffraction from tetragonal lysozyme at the wavelength of 5.76 Å. Diffraction peaks are observed to 7 Å resolution only (image not shown).</p><p>Helium box containing sample mount, photodiode and cryostream.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID1: EXAFS at the K-absorption edge of phosphorus</head><p>Clean X-ray absorption spectra were obtained in relatively narrow energy range, which was fortunately centred at the K-edge of phosphorus. At slightly larger energies, i.e. about 10 eV above the edge, artefacts were introduced. Considerable time has been invested by one of us (P.B.) to find the reason for this unexpected behaviour of the X-ray optics (double mirror -double monochromator). The production of a monochromatic, 'constant -exit' beam at low X-ray energies will need further systematic studies. All foreseen samples were not measured due to a lack of time. Also, a fluorescence measurement may help alleviate transmission problems.</p><p>A few X-ray diffraction test pictures were taken at a temperature of T = 40K. The intensity was lower than expected. A considerable gain should have come from the use of the image plates designed for the use of low energy radiation (LE-IP). Their protective layer of 5 µm cellulose acetate is much lower than that from ordinary Ips with 70 µm protective layer thickness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The helium box remained operational throughout the beam time. The leaks were negligibly small. In particular the large thin Mylar window of 6 µm thickness was not damaged. The helium pressure of 2 mb above atmospheric pressure remained stable. The liquid helium consumption was low, about 1 l per hour.</p><p>The helium box remained operational throughout the beam time. The leaks were negligibly small. In particular the large thin Mylar window of 6 µm thickness was not damaged. The helium pressure of 2 mb above atmospheric pressure remained stable. The liquid helium consumption was low, about 1 l per hour. The sensitivity of image plates designed for low energies needs to by studied over a broad range of wavelengths, in the same way as this has already been done with 'ordinary' image plates (MI384).</p><p>The following modifications and additions to the helium box are presently made: 1) intermediate chamber for the transfer of the sample into the helium-filled box.</p><p>2) X-Y alignment of the sample in a way which avoids opening the helium box.</p><p>3) deviation of the cold helium gas flow by a very thin walled internal cylinder of 8 cm diameter, 4) retractable fluorescent screen inside the helium box, for direct observation of the crystal in the beam.</p><p>(this works perfectly well with soft X-rays) These are low-cost modifications which will be used in May 2003. They are essential for diffraction experiments and spectroscopic measurements with soft X-rays, in particular at low temperatures. The system will work in such a way that no air may penetrate the helium-filled box during the experiment, including sample exchange. In future, there should be no problems due to the beam line including the helium box with the image plate. For protein crystallography with soft X-rays the preparation of the crystal and their mounting will decide on the success. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: helium box mounted in ID1 experimental hutch.</figDesc></figure>
