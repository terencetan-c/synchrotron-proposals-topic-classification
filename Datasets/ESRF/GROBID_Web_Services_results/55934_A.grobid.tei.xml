<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the membranes, despite our decision to work at 22 keV. This is a high energy compared to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, but it allows the beam to pass through the liquid without suffering of absorbtion. We have however successfully characterized the membranes both by XRR and AFM. The AFM images here reported are the first ones ever acquired during an X-Ray beamtime on hydrated samples (AFM measurement under liquid conditions). Finally, evidence of radiation damage brought us to develop strategies to use the AFM to investigate the effects on the membranes. A set of attenuators was employed to minimize the radiation damage during the acquisition of the XRR data. The beam size was 300 μm x 30 μm (horizontal x vertical). The flux at the sample position was 2x10 13 photons/second. At first, we have successfully tested the capabilities of our custom-made Atomic Force Microscope at ID03 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A typical experimental session included the acquisition of XRR and AFM data on the membranes as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (experiment on DPPC). After acquiring a topographical image of an interesting area (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), the mechanical stability of the membranes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) was assessed by extracting the maximum force necessary to break the bilayers (20 nN ca.), which is a characteristic parameter for each bilayer with determined environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In the same area, the associated X-Ray Reflectivity was acquired, giving information about the thickness of the membranes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). The alignment between the beam and the AFM tip /cantilever was obtained by measuring the electrons flowing in the cantilever once the X-Ray beam was incident on it (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>). </p></div>

The curves have been shifted of 6 nm in the X-Axes for better clarity. c) Associated X-Ray Reflectivity from which we evaluate the bilayer thickness of 5.5 nm. Experimental data (blue circles) and best fit (continuous red line).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase transition study:</head><p>A typical experiment performed on DPPC membrane is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. At 44 degrees XRR is showing a decrease of the membrane thickness, whereas the AFM image shows an increase of the substrate coverage and the coexistence of the two lipid phases. The two phases show different mechanical properties as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>. Clearly, data show a loss in membrane thickness and an inclination of the lipids in the liquid phase which results in a mechanical stability with lower breaking forces compared to the gel phase. We are currently trying to understand the correlation between the SLD profiles and the mechanical properties of the membranes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DPPC:DLPC (1:1)</head><p>The same data were acquired on DPPC:DLPC (1:1) model membranes.</p><p>A dataset is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. As observed in the case of simple DPPC, at 44 degrees XRR is showing a decrease of the membrane thickness, whereas the AFM image shows an increase of the substrate coverage. Indeed at 27 degrees there is a coexistence of DLPC in liquid phase and DPPC in gel phase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>), whereas at 44 degrees the DPPC is mostly in liquid phase as DLPC, although some Gel parts are still present.</p></div>

<div><p>As shown, the AFM has been particularly useful to check the radiation damage on the model membrane and consequently in the setting up of the X-Ray beam attenuators during the acquisition of the XRR curves in order to minimize these effects.</p><p>Our future efforts will be devoted to study the effects of the insertion of small molecules, such as Triptophane and Melatonin, in model lipid membranes employing the strategies developed during the experiment at ID03. Since we aim to acquire X-Ray Surface Scattering data too, we will make efforts to reduce and control the amount of liquid hydrating the sample by designing a humidity chamber for our instrument.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the images presented in this report, together with those presented in the report of the <rs type="institution" subtype="infrastructure">ESRF</rs> experiment <rs type="grantNumber">LS2339</rs>, are the first AFM images performed under liquid conditions in a synchrotron beamline.
