<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this work is to study the complexation mechanism between uranyl and TBP in C 4 mimTf 2 N. In kerosene, it is well known that the extraction of uranyl is made through the formation of a neutral complex UO 2 (NO 3 ) 2 (TBP) 2 . In imidazolium based-RTILs, the studies made until now on cation transfert from acidic aqueous solution into the RTIL containing a neutral extractant agent (like crown-ether) <ref type="bibr">[i]</ref> suggest that the extraction may not be achieved through the formation of a neutral complex, but by a cation exchange process between a cationic complex and the imidazolium cation.</p><p>We have analysed solutions in which uranyl ions are readily dissolved and solutions obtained from liquidliquid extraction, in order to compare the coordination sphere of uranyl extracted in TBP/C 4 mimTf 2 N the coordination sphere of uranyl dissolved in the same solution. The influence of the anion on the nature of the complexes formed was checked by analyzing TPB/C 4 mimTf 2 N solutions in which uranyl salts are dissolved (uranyle nitrate and triflate). The effect of the solvent on the structure of the complexes formed was checked by using C 4 mimTf 2 N and a conventional aliphatic solvent, dodecane.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> displays the exeprimental spectra of 3 samples. (UO 2 )(NO 3 ) 2 (TBP) 2 is the our reference compound, known to be the neutral extracted species by the TBP/dodecane system. This is confirmed by our experiment, the two EXAFS and corresponding FT are identical. The green line represents the spectrum of a sample obtained by liquid liquid extraction of uranyl by the system TBP/C 4 mimTf 2 N. The difference observed on the FT spectra, in particular in the 2-2.25 Å region which corresponds to the nitrate ions, show that the uranyl complex extracted in this case is not the neutral (UO 2 )(NO 3 ) 2 (TBP) 2 , but certainly a cationic complex. The data analysis is still under progress. [i] M.P. Jensen, J.A. Dzielawa, P. Rickert, M.L Dietz, J. Am. <ref type="bibr">Chem.
