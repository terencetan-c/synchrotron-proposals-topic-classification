<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to characterize micro structural features such as activated slip systems, dislocation densities, deviatoric strains and local orientations in micron sized Cu tensile samples in order to get a better inside in the deformation behaviour of materials at the micron scale. The analyzed samples consisted of two groups: Group A was deformed inside the scanning electron microscope (SEM) at our home laboratory. The second group B was focused ion beam (FIB) milled at our home facility and strained using our new in situ straining device designed for BM32.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples of group A:</head><p>Deformed Cu tensile samples, strained inside the SEM to 4% (Sample P1) respectively 25% (Sample P2 and P3) were raster-scanned with a step size of 1µm using a one micron sized white X-Ray beam.</p><p>Based on these measurements the local orientation and storage of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) was analyzed leading to a schematic slip mechanism map. This map indicates if the stored dislocations originate from one or more slip systems. Furthermore, the formation of sub grains is indicated in the map. Note that the sample head and base were not deformed.</p><p>Results of the experiments with Group A are already submitted to Phil. Mag. Letters. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples of group B:</head><p>Mainly tensile tests on samples ranging from 3 to 6µm crosssection diameter were performed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> presents a typical stress strain curve of a tensile sample. Positions where the images were read out are marked as red spots. Furthermore, some typical diffraction patterns of the (024) Laue spot are presented with the corresponding position showed in the stress strain curve. Laue peak streaking directions for different slip systems (rank in Schmid factor is displayed near the streak, highest Schmid factor = 1) are projected on the measured peak shape. Based on this images it's fact, that in the initial state of deformation an unpredicted slip system was activated. Nevertheless, by reaching the plateau of the stress strain curve, dislocations of this system were able to escape to the sample surface and the diffraction peak width was reduced considerable till to the maximum applied strain of 25%. In summary, the experiments were a sucess and -for our knowledge -the first in situ µLaue tensile test on micron sized samples. The setup -namely the stage, the optical microscope and detector system of BM32 in combination with our new straining device -fulfilled our expectations completely, especially the negligible vibrations and the thermal stability of stage and hutch were impressive. Nevertheless, it's clear that there is a demand for more in situ micromechanical tests. For instance we were not able to monitor the deviatoric strains during loading. Results of the ex situ analyzed samples of group A are already submitted to Phil. Mag.</p><p>Letters. Furthermore we expect that data from the in situ experiments (group B) will be submitted to a refered journal in the next weeks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Slip mechanism maps indicating if the peak streaking direction indicates a single or multiple slip with or without forming dislocation substructures.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,33.96,567.84,222.12,184.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The red points indicate where images were read out from the CCD. b) indicates the position of the primary beam during the measurement. c-g) are showing the the (024) diffraction spot at different positions of the stress strain curve, indicated by the color code. The projected streaking axes are predictions for the storage of geometrically necessary dislocations on a slip systems. The length of the streaking axes indicates a crystal rotation of 1deg each. In addition, the blue path shows up the movement of the diffraction spot which is in agreement with the classical theorie of constrained tensile experiments.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,36.84,416.88,123.48,124.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
