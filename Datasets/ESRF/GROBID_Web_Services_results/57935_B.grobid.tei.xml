<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Objectives</head><p>The goal of this experiment is to measure angular dependent Fe 1s2p Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) on single crystal Fe 3 O 4 below and above the Curie temperature (T C ~858K). We aim to address the following points through our measurement:</p><p>1. Assign spectral features to specific Fe sites taking advantage of the spectral details revealed in the RIXS-LD planes on the basis of ligand field multiplet calculations. 2. Map the symmetry of the unoccupied orbitals from the measurement of the 360 o angular behaviour of the dichroic features. The orbital selectivity of the angular dependence combined with the site selectivity of Fe 1s2p RIXS enables us to probe site selectively the symmetry of the unoccupied orbitals. 3. Disentangle the interplay between structural and magnetic dichroism by following the temperature dependence of the dichroic signal below and above the T C of Fe 3 O 4 . 4. Validate the theoretical angular dependence of the RIXS cross-section in the presence and absence of exchange field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiment details 2.1 Samples</head><p>Magnetite is a naturally occurring metastable form of iron oxide that has a chemical formula of Fe 3 O 4 . It crystallizes in a cubic (isometric) crystal system, with the oxide anions arranged in a cubic close-packed lattice. The cations (Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ) are arranged in an inverse spinel structure such that half of the Fe 3+ cations occupy the octahedral (O h ) sites and the other half occupies the tetrahedral (T d ) sites in the lattice (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). On the other hand, all the Fe 2+ cations occupy the O h sites. The crystal lattice constant is of 8.397Å at standard room conditions. Fe 3 O 4 is a ferrimagnetic material where the magnetic moments of Fe cations in T d and O h sites are coupled antiferromagnetically. The following samples were measured during the beamtime:</p><p>Number Sample Description 1 Fe 3 O 4 powder d &lt; 5um, 95% (from Sigma-Adricht , Product 310069) 2 Fe 3 O 4 (110) natural Cut and polished to a (110) surface (from SurfaceNet) 3 Fe 3 O 4 (111) Cut and polished to a (111) surface Fe O natural (from SurfaceNet) 4 Fe 3 O 4 (110) synthetic Cut and polished to a (110) surface (from Instituto de Nanociencia de Aragón) 5 Fe 3 O 4 (111) synthetic Cut and polished to a (111) surface (from Instituto de Nanociencia de Aragón) 6 Fe 3 O 4 (110) synthetic Cut and unpolished to a (110) surface (from AGH University of Science and Technology) 7 Fe 3 O 4 (111) synthetic Cut and unpolished to a (111) surface (from AGH University of Science and Technology) 8 Fe 2 O 3 (001) natural Cut and polished to (001) surface (from Surface Prep.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">High temperature setup</head><p>The high temperature setup was designed to operate either under vacuum (~10 -6 mbar) or under static over-pressure of inert gas (pressure&lt;1.3 bar inside the furnace) to presvent oxidation of Fe 3 O 4 at high temperatures. The high temperature setup consists of:  Huber 360 degrees rotational stage.  Furnace that can heat up to 1000 o C under vacuum (micro-tomo furnace borrowed from the sample environment).  Be dome cover (500 um thick) for the furnace to withstand the temperature and pressure requirements while having satisfactory transmission in the energy range from 6.4 to 7.2 KeV (the dome was borrowed from ID28).  Slip ring to input the cooling water and the gases to the furnace without having to allow for rotating the furnace without rotating the cooling and gas tubing (DSTI LT-2141).  Cold N 2 gun for cooling the Be dome and removing any formed ozone from the surface of the Be dome.  Vacuum turbo-pump (reaches ~10 -7 mbar).  High purity He gas (BIP He, O 2 &lt; 10ppm) for experiments done under static over-pressure of inert gas.  Pressure relief valve and a burst disk to regulate the pressure of the inert gas during heating.  A relay controlled system that switches the heating off if the temprature of the Be window exceeds 200 o C.</p><p>The setup design (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) allows us to:  Rotate the sample 300 o about the surface normal at high temperatures (upto 1000 o C) under vacuum (~1x10 -6 mbar at 1000 o C).  The high temperature setup proofed to work well during the first measurments (sample 1 and 2 were succesfully measured without oxidation). However, at the end of the experiment, the slip ring malfunctioned and the water cooling circuit leaked water into the He gas circuit. This lead to the oxidation of sample 6 at high temperature. In-order to avoid such leakages in future experiments, the slip ring will only be used for the water cooling circuit and the gases will be delivered directly to the furnace without using the slip ring.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>) (and b) shows HERFD XANES (XES) for the two orientations and the dichroism signal. Three dichroic features can be seen in the pre-edge region (7.110-7.117 KeV) and only the Fe K α1 shows visible dichroism with the current statistics. In order to understand the dichroic feature in more detail, we measure angular dependent 1s2p RIXS for the same configurations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows four main RIXS magnetic liner dichroism (MLD) features in the pre-edge region. Rotating the sample a full 360 o shows a pure quadrupole angular behaviour for all features except that at incident energy = 7.1141 KeV and emission energy of 6.4044 KeV (shown in green in Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).  w 1s2p RIXS: 0 o 1s2p RIXS: 90 o Dichroism a) b) c) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">(110) Fe 3 O 4 single crystal in the transverse configuration</head><p>We present here the results of the ( <ref type="formula">110</ref> quadrupole angular behaviour for all features except that at incident energy = 7.1143 KeV and emission energy of 6.40537 KeV (shown in black in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10b</ref>).  It can be seen that the features at incidence energy 7.11331 and 7.1151 KeV are not overlapping as in Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>. Comparing with this result with CFM calculations of the three Fe sites in Fe 3 O 4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>), we observe this shift for the Fe 2+ O h sites with spinorbit coupling of the 3d valence electrons=100%. Thus we conclude that the shift is a sensitive probe of the spin-orbit coupling and the exchange field interaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">High temperature measurement</head><p>In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the linear dichroism signal, we study RIXS-LD as a function of temperature. The long range order of the magnetic moments of Fe in Fe 3 O 4 is destroyed at temperatures higher than the Curie temperature (T C ~858K). Making use of the fact that the crystal field dichroism should not exhibit any temperature dependence, in contrast with the magnetic part which scales with &lt;M 2 &gt;, helps us disentangle both effects and determine their relative strength.</p></div>

Comparing the spectral shape of the Fe 3 O 4 at 988 o C to Fe 2 O 3 , we conclude that the sample did not oxidise (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">13</ref>). This could also be confirmed from the phase diagram shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref>.

The sample was heated up to 898 o C in vacuum (~10 -6 mbar). The same spectral changes could be seen in the pre-edge region. However, the quality of the natural commercial crystal is not good (possibly the crystal has many defects and high mosaicity) as no angular dependence could be observed at room temperature of high temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref>) .  </p></div>

As can be seen, the sample is oxidized at 900 o C and the pre-edge looks like that of Fe 2 O 3 (shown in brown). This is because the slip ring leaked water vapour into the furnace. 4. Conclusions  Using 1s2p RIXS linear dichroism, we are able to reveal the 1s3d quadrupole pre-edge transitions that are otherwise suppressed by the dipole allowed transition at the Fe 3+ T d sites of Fe 3 O 4 .  Using the orbital selectivity of angular dependent RIXS, we map the unoccupied valence orbitals of selective sites (Error! Reference source not found. focusing on the three pre-edge features which we assign to Fe 2+ sites of Fe 3 O 4 based on multiplet calculations).  Using 1s2p RIXS magnetic dichroism, we can sensitively probe the spin-orbit and exchange field interactions at the Fe 2+ sites of Fe 3 O 4 .</p></div>
