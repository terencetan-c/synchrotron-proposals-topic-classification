<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The Russian Grant proposal was granted a beamtime through Management Contingency. All the allocated beamtime was fruitfully utilized by Russian users thereby the main goal of the Management Contingency beamtime at promoting scientific use of the ESRF by Russia was achived. The original scientific report (written in Russian) was accepted by the Russian Ministry.</p><p>Briefly, it was demonstrated that absolute structure of MnSi and FeSi can be determined even for huge crystals (~ 4000 × 4000 ×100 mkm) by means of high energy synchrotron radiation (wavelength 0.158 Å). A comparison with the data collected at BM01A (the wavelength 0.68 Å) for the same crystal shows the correctness of the absolute structure measured at the higher energy. The crystallograpihic chirality determined for the samples grown in the same syntering conditions coincides. Analysing the statistical distribution of the chirality measure, i.e. the distribution of Parsons quotients, shows that the chirality is the same over the sample area. As a rule, the sample chirality inherits the seed chirality. Although, there finds out some exeptions for FeSi samples.</p></div>			</div>
