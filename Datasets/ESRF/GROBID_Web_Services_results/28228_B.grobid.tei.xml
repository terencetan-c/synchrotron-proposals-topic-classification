<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SI-1021 was proposed to investigate the kinetic aspects of the growth and structure of organic heterostructures of two organic semiconductors, DIP and F16CuPc. The objectives of this experiment have been succefully accomplished revealing important and unexpected aspects of the growth of organic on organic.</p><p>We have performed in-situ and simultaneously X-ray Specular reflectometry and GIXD during the growth of DIP on top of F16CuPc. Additionaly Real-time measurement of the intensity at the 3/2 and 1/2 Bragg point Vs coverage have been performed.</p><p>First the DIP growth has been studied, for three different substrates temperatures, -10ºC, 25ºC and 120ºC and for three different thicknesses of the underlying F 16 CuPc films. The F16CuPc films have been grown at 120ºC in all the cases to obtain a well ordered film as template. The most striking results are summarized in the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> corresponding to the growth of DIP on top of 1.7 ML of F 16 CuPc (molecules standing upright).</p><p>First we draw our attention to the X-ray specular data. At -10ºC, the growth of DIP takes place in a standing up configuration as evidenced by the position of the first and second order Bragg reflections (d=16.6 Å). This is the same structure observed for the growth on SiO 2 . The formation of interference fringes (Kiessig oscillations) reveals the formation of smooth films. Additionaly Real-time measurement of the intensity at the 3/2 and 1/2 Bragg point confirms that the growth occurs nearly layer by layer. At 120ºC a different growth mode is obtained. The first 17 Å of DIP (1 ML) form a flat layer, that is, DIP wets the F 16 CuPc film. Further deposition of DIP leads to the development of high islands as evidenced by appearance of narrow Bragg reflections. This shows that DIP exhibits a Stranski-Krastanov growth mode at 120ºC. In spite of the morphological changes, the DIP structure perpendicular to the surface is the same for low and high temperature (a layer spacing of ~16.6 Å). The profiles of the mean electronic density projected along the perpendicular to the surface have been obtained from a preliminar analysis of the X-ray reflectivity by parratt formalism taking a model of boxes.</p><p>Especially interesting is the evolution of the in-plane structure. GIXD scans were measured simultaneously with the X-ray specular data (lower part of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The black curve shows the data for F 16 CuPc before DIP deposition. Two in-plane Bragg reflections are observed indicative of the structure of the standing phase. Thus, the GIXD and X-ray reflectivty data suggest the formation of a stading up phase with the molecules oriented in a cofacial stacking with a distance of 14.6 Å between molecular rows. This structure differs from that obtained for thicker films where a spacing of 10 Å is obtained <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We have determined that this structure forms only in the first monolayer. More work about the determination of the structure in F 16 CuPc films is in progress. Notice that when 1 ML of DIP is deposited on top of F 16 CuPc at 120ºC, a shift in both peaks is observed, from d=14.6 Å to 11.91 Å and from d= 3.22 Å to 3.34 Å. From the X-ray specular data we know that DIP is depostied on top of F 16 CuPc so we can discard the formation of an organic alloy by the intermixing of both molecules. This has been corrobored by AFM experiments perfomed recently in our lab. This evidenced that DIP induces a structural rearrangement of the F 16 CuPc molecules underneath. Further DIP depostion does not cause additional changes. In contrast, at -10ºC, no changes in the F 16 CuPc in-plane structure are produced. Surprisingly, the in-plane DIP structure does not change and is identical to that observed for the DIP growth on SiO 2 . Thus, we are in a completely inverse scenario to that observed for inorganic semiconductors where the lattice of the material deposited on top is often modified within the first layers due to the interaction in the interface.</p><p>The same structrural changes are observed when DIP is grown on top of thicker F 16 CuPc films. But in these case the changes occur partially. The analysis of the integrated intensity of the in-plane reflections allow us to estimate that about 2 ML of F 16 CuPc close to the organic-organic interface are modified.</p><p>The growth of F 16 CuPc on top of DIP has only been studied for 120ºC. The specular data evidences the formation of a flat and smooth film of standing F 16 CuPc molecules. Thus, no islands are formed. Surprisingly, the in-plane date shows the formation of the observed modified-structure (with a 12 Å spacing) for the first layer of F 16 CuPc and for the subsequent layers (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Thus, we can conclude that the DIP-F 16 CuPc interaction lead to the formation of a new F 16 CuPc structure at 120ºC.</p><p>To conclude, well ordered bilayers of DIP/F 16 CuPc and F 16 CuPc/DIP can be formed at room or lower temperatures (-10ºC). In contrast, at 120ºC, DIP on F 16 CuPc leads to Stranski-Krastanov growth; we have determined that DIP deposition casuses a structural change in the last 2 ML F 16 CuPc layers underneath. The formation of a new structural phase in the interface might be responsible for the Stranski-Krastanov growth. This study reveals completely new aspects of the growth of organic heterostructures whose mechanisms seem to differ from those of inorganic heterostructures. Further structural investigations are required at different temperatures to understand the kinetic and energetics of the structural changes. The investigation with a different organic molecule, combined either with DIP or with F 16 CuPc, is mandatory in order to elucidate the specificity of the molecular interactions and to obtain a more general picture of the growth of organic heterostructures.
