<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Local contact(s): Cesare Atzori Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Andrew Michael Beale* Professor Gopinathan Sankar Mr Sebastian Stockenhuber* Mr Kallum Mehta* Miss Maria Asuncion Molina Esquinas* Report:</p><p>The first run was to determine the changes observed in a typical catalyst, that is, 60:30:10 ratio of Cu:Zn:Al.</p><p>To do this, a 1.5 mm diameter borosilicate capillary was loaded with ~100 mg of 250 -150 μm catalyst which was diluted with SiO2 to avoid too much self-absorption. The beamline furnace was then installed and the initial XAFS/XRD taken to see whether the dilution worked. Once we were satisfied with this, we ran 40 mL/min He through the capillary, and increased the temperature to 160 °C. Once at this temperature another XAFS/XRD was taken and H2 concentration increased to 4 vol %, while keeping the flowrate at 40 mL/min. Once this was reached, the temperature would slowly go up, taking XAFS/XRD as the temperature increased.</p><p>Once at 230 °C, multiple XAFS/XRD were taken and then the temperature brought back to room temperature to passivate in 1,5,10 and 20 % O2. Each time, XAFS/XRD were taken.</p><p>To confirm not only gases that were detected successfully but leaks weren't present, the Mass Spectroscopy (MS) machine measured Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide and Water. All relevant experiments, besides the 5 wt. % Dry which due to mechanical failure didn't record, had their Mass Spec responses recorded successfully. It is noted that for Dry, the hydrogen is consistent and almost immediate, mainly owing to the high GHSV. In the case of the wet experiment's response was relatively sporadic, owing to the fact no condenser was installed down-stream. For future experiments involving water, it may be prudent to install a condenser with a reservoir as the mass spectroscopy isn't well equipped to handle that amount of water.</p><p>The XANES are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> below. Unfortunately, the XRD were also as in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, which indicates that during preparation or operation the beamstop location could have been moved. This could also be exacerbated by the dilutant silica, thus making XRD impractical for size and strain calculations. This causes the Cu and Zn to be overwhelmed by SiO2, resulting in difficult to discern XRD plots. In both cases, the copper reduces above 150 °C, however, the XRD suggests that Cu metal continues to form until 230 °C which is difficult to observe in the XAS. However, it should be noted that the silica had shifted, making direct comparisons difficult to nigh-on impossible, with some XRD measurements not available. This makes the XAS the main focus of the investigation. The data collected has shown that there is an obvious difference between the nature of reduction in 0, 1 and 5 wt. % Cs2O, but the electronic state seems to change a lot quicker than any phase, as was shown in the XRD that could be understood. The effect of even saturated water vapour is also drastic, with copper and water vapour interacting at reducing temperatures to reform Cu 1+ , when without Cs2O. When a high concentration of Cs2O was involved, the onset of full reduction was delayed drastically, essentially requiring harsher conditions to achieve the same active sites. For zinc, as of now, there seems to be little known difference before and after reduction, along with little difference between the Cs2O concentrations. Using the fourier transform and kspacing the Zn-O distances can be determined which could provide further information. Additionally, changes in copper will be determined using this and Linear Combination Analysis (LCA). This data will act as the cornerstone for the electronic interaction aspect of understanding how water and high Cs2O concentration affects real-world WGS pellets, with data taken from ID31 and BM28 recently complimenting this. This work will be aimed to be published together, as part of a comprehensive picture.</p><p>9000 9200 9400 9600 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Normalised xm (E) Energy (eV) 9000 9200 0.8 1.0 1.2 Normalised xm (E) Energy (eV) RT 150 C 170 C 190 C 210 C 230 C 30 35 40 45 0 100 200 300 Arbitrary Intensity °2 θ RT 150 Ramp 230-1 Ramp 230-2 Ramp 230-3 Ramp 230-4 Ramp 230-5 230-1 230-2 230-3</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1.
