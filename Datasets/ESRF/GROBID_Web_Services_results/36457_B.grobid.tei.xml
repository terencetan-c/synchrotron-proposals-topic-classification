During this experiment, we performed XAS speciation of selenite sorbed onto Fe 3 O 4 and Fe/Fe 3 C nanoparticles (NPs). Fe 3 O 4 NPs (d=4-6 nm) have been prepared by co-precipitation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) in basic solutions under ultrasound. Air-stable Fe/Fe 3 C NPs (d=25-100 nm) have been prepared by Fe(CO) 5 sonicating in diphenylmethane solutions and subsequently annealing the as-prepared product at 700°C in pure argon. Also the preliminary data were obtained on the preparation of zero-valent selenium NPs inserted within the mesoporous silica using power ultrasound. The results on selenite immobilization has been published in Environ. Sci. Technol. Arroyabe Loyo R.L., Nikitenko S.I., Scheinost, A.C., Simonoff, M.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immobilization of selenite onto Fe 3 O 4 and Fe/Fe 3 C NPs:</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the XANES spectra at selenium K-edge for Se(IV) adsorbed onto Fe 3 O 4 NPs at different pH values. The strong similarity of the edges in these spectra with that of aqueous selenite indicates that the oxidation state of Se(IV) did not change due to the sorption in the pH range of 4.8-8.0. The selenium k 3 -weighted EXAFS signal of the sorption sample at pH 7.9 shows a single sine-like oscillation, corresponding to a backscattering shell at a distance of 1.4 Å before correcting for the phase shift. This shell could be fitted by three O atoms at a distance of 1.70 Å, in line with the structure of Se(IV) compounds. After reduction to Se(0) or Se(-II), one would observe a significant shift of the coordination shell to longer distances, since Se and Fe coordination shells in a variety of solids vary between 2.3 to 2.6 Å. Since no significant backscattering contribution in this range could be found, this is clear evidence that no reduction of Se(IV) took place. The same conclusion applies for the EXAFS spectra at pH 5.6 and 4.8.</p><p>In contrast to Fe 3 O 4 , sorption of Se(IV) onto Fe/Fe 3 C NPs causes significant changing in the selenium oxidation state (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The XANES absorption edge (12654.8 eV) is 5.5 eV lower than that of aqueous selenite, 1.3 eV lower than that of trigonal Se(0), and similar to that of FeSe (12655.2 eV). At the same time, the white line is reduced in intensity in comparison to Se(IV), suggesting an increased population of the valence 4p levels. Both features are in line with a complete reduction to Se(-II). Thus it can be concluded that the removal of selenite ions with Fe/Fe 3 C NPs at anaerobic conditions occurs via Se(IV) reduction to Se(-II). The EXAFS spectrum and the corresponding Fourier transform of the Fe/Fe 3 C NPs sample are more similar to those of FeSe than to those of Se(0) and FeSe 2 . A multishell fit of the spectrum achieved the following structural data: 3.3 Fe @ 2.42 Å, 1.8 Se @ 3.46 Å, and 3.6 Se @ 3.98 Å, which are different from those of tetragonal FeSe: 4 Fe @ 2.37 Å, 8 Se @ 3.77 Å, and 4 Se @ 3.91 Å. The relatively small coordination numbers suggest formation of ultrasmall FeSe particles with a structure somewhat different from that of bulk crystalline FeSe.</p><p>12.64 12.66 12.68 12.70 Se(IV) sorbed magnetite pH=7.9 pH=5.6 pH=4.8 trigonal (gray) Se(0) SeO 3 2-(pH=6) Energy [keV] Normalized Absorption 12.64 12.66 12.68 12.70 tetragonal FeSe Se(IV) sorbed FeC trigonal Se(0) SeO 3 2-(pH=6) Energy [keV] Normalized Absorption Preliminary XAS study revealed formation of a red form of Se(0) NPs after Se(IV) reduction with hydrazine at pH=3.0 in the presence of mesoporous silica SBA-15 under the effect of power ultrasound (I= 30 W/cm 2 , f= 20 kHz, T= 36°C, Ar).
