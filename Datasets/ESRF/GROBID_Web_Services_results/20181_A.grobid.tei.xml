<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>EMBL Epstein-Barr virus is a γ-Herpesvirus which infects more than 90% of the world poulation with a life-long persistance, which often leads to lymphomas in immunosuppressed individuals.. The protease of this virus is produced as a polyprotein together with the scaffold protein and is essential for capsid formation and the encapsidation of the genome. It is a good target for the development of antiviral drugs. The protease could be produced as recombinant protein in E. coli. After inhibition with diisopropyl-fluorophosphate (DFP) the protein could be cristallised in space group P6 1 22 with cell parameters of a=b=53.8 Å c=348.6 Å. During congelation of the crystals for the data collection unit cell and symmetry change to P3 1 21 with the parameters a=b=52.8, c=330.5 Å. the resolution of the diffraction increases from 3.3 to 2.3 Å but the crystals become twinned by merohedrie with twinning fractions close to 50 %. This twinning could not be overcome. Still, the structure could be solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the related KSHV protease (50 % identity). The structure was refined to an R cryst of 20% and an R free of 27% against twinned data using CNS. The inhibitor is clearly seen bound to the active site serine. The structure gives some hints how a large loop close to the active site may be involved in substrate recognition. Large parts of the long loops of the structure are visible despite very high temperature factors in these areas.</p><p>The large unit cell and weak diffraction required data collections on the undulator beamlines ID29, ID14-1, ID14-3, ID14-4 and in a microfocus experiment on ID13.</p><p>Manuscript in preparation: W.P. Burmeister, M. Buisson, J.-F. Hernandez, R. W.H. Ruigrok, E. Drouet and J.M. Seigneurin.
