<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Monitoring degradation of hybrid nanostructures in situ using X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy</p><p>Experiment number: SC-5389 Beamline: ID02 Date of experiment: from: 14.04.2023 to: 17.04.2023 Date of report: 17.07.2023 Shifts: 9 Local contact(s): William Chevremont Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dageförde N., University of Hamburg Otange B., University of Hamburg Otto F., University of Hamburg Schulz F., University of Hamburg Report:</p><p>The degradation and dissolution of a hybrid nanoparticle was observed in regard of their chemical and colloidal stability in different aquatic environments for potential use in drug delivery applications. The particle system consisted of a Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 shell as a porous metal organic framework with potential drug loading capability. Encapsulated inside were gold nanoparticle cores as tracers for successfully dissolved particles. The resulting hybrid particle is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>In order to monitor the particle dynamics including the hydrodynamic radius and changes in the crystal structure X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements combined with wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements were used. The hybrid nanoparticles were exposed to the following aquatic solutions: H2O, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, phosphate buffered saline 1x, different HCl concentrations (0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01%, 0.001% (pH=4), 0.0001% (pH=5)) and different Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid concentrations (0.5 M, 10 mM, 1 mM).</p><p>Overall, the particles showed high longtime stability in H2O and in the tested mild HCl concentrations in regards of colloidal and chemical stability. In EDTA, PBS and DMEM the particles tend to aggregate before the dissolution of the ZIF-8 shell takes place. This showed in an unchanged intensity of the ZIF-8 WAXS signal combined with a decrease of the diffusion constant. After some time those samples lost their diffusive behavior but their crystal structure remained intact.</p><p>Under harsh degradation conditions with 0.5 M EDTA a decreasing WAXS signal intensity of the ZIF-8 crystal structure was determined before the colloidal stability was lost and the particles' diffusive behavior was lost. However, the remaining gold nanoparticle cores were not colloidal stable in solution and formed aggregates which lost their diffusive behavior. Therefore the biological application does not seem reasonable with this hybrid particle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Setup:</head><p>For both, WAXS and SAXS experiments, X-rays were monochromatized to a photon energy of 12.2 keV.</p><p>For WAXS measurements the Rayonix LX 170HS detector was used and for XPCS measurements the Eiger500K detector was used. WAXS was measured in a distance of 15 m, covering the q-range of 7 to 41 nm -1 . The XPCS detector was at the maximum distance of 31 m and covered the q-range from 0.003 to 0.03 nm -1 . All experiments were performed at room temperature using a 1 mm capillary. In order to avoid local beam damage of the sample, the sample was moved in between measurements. The XPCS measurements were performed in 8-bit mode, taking 10000 frames at 10 kHz with an exposure time of 7e-5 s each. Additional slower XPCS measurements were taken in 16-bit mode with an exposure time of 0.002 s at 250 Hz. WAXS and complementary SAXS measurements with an exposure time of 1 s were taken in 32-bit mode.</p><p>Samples were synthesized locally and washed with water to remove any excess reactants. They were then transferred into their respective medium by centrifugation and redispersion in the final degradation medium. The particle concentration is estimated to be roughly 0.5 nm. 10 µL of the sample is then transferred to a capillary and measured. Thereby changes in the samples happening within the first minutes could not be monitored completely due to the time it takes to place the capillary, clear the room and start the experiment. 2 µm A B C D</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Characterization of the examined hybrid particle.
