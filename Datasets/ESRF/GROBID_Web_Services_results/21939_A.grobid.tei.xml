<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Iron-zeolites attracted much attention for the removal of NO x and/or N 2 O from exhaust streams in the last years. In contrast to other materials, the iron catalysts do not seem to deactivate in the presence of water and SO 2 , which are always present in a real exhaust gas. There has been much discussion about the nature of the active species in iron-zeolites. Binuclear iron complexes, small iron clusters (on the order of a few nm) and also isolated iron ions were proposed to be the active sites. In many cases these conclusions were based on the activity of the catalysts in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with hydrocarbons. SCR is, however, not a very suited reaction to probe the intrinsic activity of the iron species. Factors like acid site density, diffusion of the hydrocarbon and coke formation play a big role, and may screen the actual role of the iron. N 2 O decomposition is a much more suited reaction for probing the activity of the iron species. It is a clean reaction leading to N 2 and O 2 , with no side products and it runs exclusively on the iron-species. The pure zeolite has no or very little activity (this small activity is, in fact, often due to impurities of iron in the framework). The aim of our work was to shed more light on the interaction of the iron catalyst with N 2 O. The structural changes of the iron sites upon interaction with N 2 O were probed by EXAFS and XANES. In situ XANES measurements were performed to measure the rate of oxidation of the iron sites by N 2 O under reaction conditions.</p><p>Experimental 40 mg sample were placed in the EXAFS cell and reduced in flowing H 2 at 390°C for 1h. The Fe-K edge EXAFS spectrum was then measured at liquid nitrogen temperature. Subsequently, the cell was connected to a flow of 45 ml/min N 2 O/He (1000 ppm) and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 400°C with an increment of 3°C/min. The change in shape and position of the Fe K edge was continuously followed by XANES (stepsize 1 eV). Finally, the sample was cooled down again in He and another EXAFS spectrum of the now oxidised catalyst was measured at liquid nitrogen temperature. The sample was reduced once more in flowing H 2 at 390°C for 1h and cooled down to room temperature. Then the cell was heated (3°C/min) to 350°C in 45 ml/min He. At 350°C the inlet stream of the cell was switched from He to N 2 O/He (1000 ppm) and the oxidation of the sample by N 2 O was continuously followed by XANES. In cases where the oxidation rate at 350°C was very low the sample temperature was carried to 400°C to complete the oxidation. The change of oxidation state of the samples was determined by the shift of the Fe K edge. The position of the edge was defined as the energy at half height of the edge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For all tested samples a shift of the Fe K edge to higher energies was observed during treatment with N 2 O, at temperatures between 350° C and 400 °C. The rate of oxidation differed among the samples. Fe-ZSM-5 containing mainly small (binuclear) iron oxide clusters showed the highest oxidation rate, whereas samples containing mainly large hematite clusters reacted only slowly with N 2 O. Clear differences were also observed in the EXAFS spectra of the reduced and N 2 O-oxidised materials. A detailed structural analysis of the data is under way. Qualitatively, the results indicate a much higher structural inhomogeneity in the reduced state of the iron clusters (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Note that the reduced state is the one, which can react with N 2 O and is, thus, more relevant for catalysis. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1) EXAFS spectra of Fe-ZSM-5 after reduction in H 2 (a) and subsequent oxidation by N 2 O (b).</figDesc></figure>
