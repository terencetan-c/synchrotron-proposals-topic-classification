<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>form and as bound to nanoparticles where examined for treatment and imaging. The imaging used as an indicator for X-ray absorption, sufficient for later cancer treatment. Basing on the results of the successful earlier ESRF-experiments MD118 (L-edge detection &amp; localization of heavy metals in bio-nanoparticles, magnetic liposomes at ID1) and MD128 (first K-edge detection, absorption and imaging of metal-bio-nanoparticles, at ID17) we made in the first part of the MD163 experiment a tremendous progress towards cancer treatment:</p><p>The biocompatible lanthanide complex Lutetium-DTPA, in a novel highly concentrated formulation, was successfully applied for X-ray phase contrast imaging after injection into the brain of a living rat. The X-ray experiment was done exactly at that energy, which will be later used for cancer treatment (63.9 keV). The animal survived the treatment with 10 µl of 0.253 M LuDTPA (0.44 mg Lutetium) until the end of the experiment (no brain oedema was observed). The agent was visible during 3.5 h, while the complex diffused slowly into an area of 5-10 mm size. This covers the area of a typical brain tumor in rat (Glioblastome, 3 -4 mm). Thus we are ready for a first cancer treatment pre-study with brain tumors. This shall be the focus of the further experiments, in parallel to necessary work on metal nanoparticle detection and imaging. It has to be noticed that the current success offers opportunities for novel cancer treatment with concentrated Lanthanide complexes of (Lu, … Gd) with Synchrotron X-ray as well as with Neutron radiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Strategy for Cancer treatment by indirect radiation therapy (IRT)</head><p>Radiation therapy benefits of the enhanced radiation sensitivity of many cancer cells as compared to healthy tissue. Indirect radiation therapy (IRT) reduces the unfavorable side effects evolving from radiation absorption in the healthy tissue outside the tumor by application of target materials, which upon specific absorption of external radiation, develop secondary radiation of short range or tumor-toxic products, e.g. free radicals. Indirect radiation therapy is possible with synchrotron X-rays (photon activation therapy PAT, PXT) and neutrons (neutron capture therapy NCT). In both cases the healing tumor dose (I T , D T ) has to be significant as compared to the non-specific body dose (I B , D B ), as this causes unfavorate side effects, which may reduce life quality unbearably, or even may cause secondary cancer years after the treatment. As shown in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> this is difficult because of the high body absorption of neutron and X-ray radiation (energy dependent). A further requirement arising from tumor biology is the high effectivity of tumor treatment: a tumor, which is incompletely inactivated by the treatment would desintegrate, and release residual cancer cells, which subsequently form metastases. Consequently, two treatment concepts are usual: a) Adjuvant treatment = complete healing (no cancer cell of 10 7 -10 8 in the tumor survives the treatment) b) Palliative treatment=treatment with the aim of life prolongation and quality improvement (with metastasis) We have developed a stringent strategy for the adjuvant cancer treatment, With the above calculations, this leads us to an "imaging-treatment theorem" for indirect radiation therapy:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An effective (adjuvant) cancer therapy target should be visible by in vivo contrast imaging !</head><p>The desired high target absorption can be obtained by biocompatible Lanthanide complexes and nanoparticles. Additionally we plan the application of double therapy by double-entrapping nanoparticles: radiation therapy by metal content and chemotherapy by drugs included in the same coctail (epirubicine, doxorubicine etc.). The sensitive detection, imaging and treatment is achieved by complementary experiments at ESRF-ID17 and ID1. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Result -abstract of ESRF experiment MD118 at target L-edges (ID1 : 4/2005)</head><p>The MD118 experiment gave important information of magnetic target liposome structure and target entrapping for the later medical experiments at ID17. The results yielded a) the target entrapping and enrichment at membranes (direct use in MD128 &amp; MD163) and b) target localization (important for later improvements of biological effect, quality factor Q in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The nanoparticles were :</p><p>-pure Liposomes ± metal chelates (Gd, Tm, Lu, Hf, cis-Pt) -Ferrofluid cores (15 nm) ± metal chelates, entrapped &amp; out -Metal targets -DTPA, -Citrate: in &amp; out: Gadolinium (Gd) Thulium (Tm), Lutetium (Lu), Hafnium (Hf), Platinum (Pt) Results: At the L-edges the detection limit was 0.2 mM metal (Gd, Tm, Lu). Lanthanide-DTPA did not disturb liposome structure (1M KCl inside). Ferrofluid cores were entrapped, removal outside not required. Cis-Pt was 10x enriched at PE-membranes (Soy bean PL). Fig.4: Tomography and treatment setup with rat sculp and permanent magnets 4.2. Absorption spectra -the key for an efficient target IRT application (target dose ratio R TB = I T /I B ) For the estimation of target efficency a set of 5 measurements in precise Q-cells was taken, as usual in neutron and X-ray scattering: -sample (target) in solvent, Q-cell (10 mm) -solvent (H 2 O) in Q-cell (10 mm) -empty cell EC (air), Q-cell (2.5mm Quartz -empty beam EB (air), no cell -noise of detector (dark, = black sample) The results were the precise contributions of the components, as indicated in fig.1. The K-edge absorption spectra of conentrated Fig.6: K-edge absorption Fig.5: Abs.: 0.7 M Gd-Citrate Lanthanide complexes are shown in fig.5 &amp; 6 spectrum of 1.14 M Lu-Citrate</p><p>An extract of the results is shown in table1 with data for the estimation of the unfavorate body dose by tissue/ water absorption, which reversely depends on the penetration depth d 1/2 of the radiation at the target K-edge (~ 1/E K 3 ), and the target absorptions of some important elements, but for the physiologically possible (!) concentration. The comparison shows that, 1) Iodine (usual x-ray contrast agent) leads to high body dose by the low K-edge energy; 2) Platinum (cis-Pt) has a favorate K-energy, but fails by the low physiological concentration (additionnaly it is strongly toxic and cancerogenic !!); 3) Hafnium has sufficient K-energy, but the toxic properties are unknown until now; 4) the Lanthanide-DTPA complexes can be applied in high concentration (up to 0.5 M in biocompatible formulation); the K-energy increases from Lanthanum (40 keV, too low), over Gadolinium (50.3 keV, moderate, 3 cm water penetration), to Lutetium (63.3 keV, 6 cm water penetration), which at present looks best. At the head dose level, Lutetium is 1.6x as efficient as Gadolinium.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion and perspectives</head><p>The surprisingly fast and successful progress of the project indicates the concept is right and feasible at the ESRF. The improved Lanthanide complexes (level3) and nanoparticles are biocompatible. Lutetium appears to be optimal for photon activation therapy at the radiation level. The fast progress to therapeutic imaging became possible by tight collaboration with ESRF-BMF, ID17. The rat in the first animal test survived upon application of LuDTPA in an amount suitable for cancer therapy by PAT above the K-edge (63.9 keV). Thus we are earlier (~ 1 y) as expected for the next step: starting a pre-study with tumor-rats, in parallel to the necessary studies of toxity, particle structure (L-edges, ASAXS), and imaging / tomography, especially with the further improved targets (level 4 : reduced ionic strength and improved metal montent).</p><p>Last not least our project strategy of therapy has to be discussed: It differs from the conventional project / poroposal strategy, where everything is developped step by step in a sequential manner. With the target nanoparticle project we follow by speed reasons a different strategy: parallel-start at several points (). These are currently: (target nano-chemistry), (structure of nanoparticles / L-edges at ID1), (K-edge spectroscopy and dummy-imaging / ID17); (biological tests with cell cultures &amp; bacteria); (tomography in animal tests). Now tumor treatment trials have to be started in animal ests. This strategy is, while more laborious, the result of the highest priority criterium: development of a new cancer treatment technique for urgent human application as fast as possilble (speed first !!). If this can be held, no significant problems should appear, and clinical partners can be found as soon as possible, the first human application could be in three years.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Scheme of indirect radiation therapy of brain cancer and imaging for the enhancer target Lutetium.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.00,36.84,504.00,124.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
