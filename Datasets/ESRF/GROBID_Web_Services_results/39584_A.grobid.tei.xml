<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Iron molybdates are essential materials for the industrial production of formaldehyde from methanol. (1) As such understanding their deactivation and the conditions under which this occurs is of considerable interest as it will allow for a more efficient catalyst with an extended lifetime. In a recent paper we have identified 2 previously un-observed structures in the iron molybdate material formed under highly anaerobic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The first (P1) appears to be an intermediate between the oxidized and reduced iron molybdate forms, whilst the second (P2) seems to represent a complete breakdown of the catalyst from which the material cannot be regenerated under oxidizing conditions. Whilst these anaerobic conditions are not experienced under general catalyst operation, the identification of these deactivation routes is important as these structure may form under less harsh conditions. The object of this work was to identify these exact conditions and to obtain more detailed information on the mature of P1 and P2.</p><p>Unfortunately, during the initial experiments it was found that it was not possible to reduce the amount of oxygen within the gas flow to an amount under which deactivation occurred in a reasonable time period with the mass flow controllers and gases available (i.e. even at the lowest oxygen flow rates deactivation did not occur). Therefore the work focused primarily on understanding the nature of the intermediate phases P1 and the temperature condition under which it formed.</p><p>This proved successful and we were able to use relatively low temperatures in the anaerobic environment to form the P1 phase (together with a small amount of fully reduced beta molybdate phase) and 'stabilize' it for long periods (figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Interestingly after the reduction of the initial FeMo phase to form P1 we note that formaldehyde formation (as observed by online mass spectroscopy) continued without further reduction of the catalyst (figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). This is unexpected because under anaerobic conditions the formation of formaldehyde from methanol unusually produces a molecule of water with the additional oxygen being extracted from the catalyst phase in a Mars-van Krevelen type manner (as there is no gaseous oxygen).</p><p>It seems then that under these mild conditions, and in the presence of the P1 phase, formaldehyde can be produced without further reduction of the catalyst, which would result in total deactivation. Therefore formaldehyde production may here occur via a different mechanism to that described preciously. Work is ongoing to confirm this data using full gas chromatography measurements, however if correct this observation could have important implications for the operation of iron molybdate type catalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1:</head><p>The formation of the stabilized P1 phase along with some beta was observed at 250°C (a). The evolution of this phase along with the initial FeMo demonstrates its stability even under the reducing anaerobic conditions, whilst the mass spectrum data demonstrates continued production of formaldehyde.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Although the conditions under which the phases P1 and P2 formed could not be identified we have used temperature variation to 'stabilize' the P1 intermediate and demonstrated that formaldehyde can be produced over this material under anaerobic conditions. This is of significant interest as it may suggest an alternate route to formaldehyde production at low temperatures over this 'intermediate' and further detailed catalytic test on these materials remains ongoing to confirm these observations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr. M.
