<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>The goal of the experiments was to provide in-situ density data and to determine the equation of state of dry and hydrous andesitic liquids for the pressure-temperature (P-T) range related to subduction zones using Xray absorption. During the allocated beamtime at ESRF ID27, experiments were performed using a panoramic Paris-Edinburgh Press (PE Press). We were able to systematically measure the absorption contrast of dry and hydrous andesitic melts as a function of pressure (0.7 to 4.0 GPa) , temperature (1600 to 1930K) and water content of 0, 5.5 and 9.0 wt%. All samples had been synthesized in a piston-cylinder apparatus and characterized (compositional analyses, density measurements and FTIR analyses) prior the beamtime at ETH Zurich. The run products of the experiments have been recovered and analysed with electron microprobe for major element composition, Raman spectroscopy for water content and LA-ICPMS for possible contamination with boron. Thanks to the succesful experiments, we have derived the equation of state for both dry and hydrous andesitic melts from the measured X-ray absorption contrast. We determined the partial molar volume of water in andesitic melts and observed that the partial molar volume of water is independent of silicate composition. A manuscript describing the experiments and results has been accepted by Earth and Planetary Science Letters <ref type="bibr">(Malfait et al., accepted)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Setup:</head><p>High pressure and temperature experiments were generated in a panoramic PE press, using 7 mm tungsten carbide anvils. The sample containers consisted of natural single crystal diamond cylinders (Almax Industries, Belgium) with Ø in = 0.5 mm, Ø out = 1.5 mm and a height of 1.0 mm. The capsule was sealed by Pt disks (200 µm) on both sides and enclosed in an hBN cylinder and two hBN caps were placed on both ends acting as pressure-transmitting medium. The furnace assembly is placed inside a standard 7 mm boron gasket. The absorption scans were collected with two ionization chambers and at a relatively low X-ray energy (Mo edge, 20.0 keV) for an optimal absorption contrast. Two different pressure marker (hBN and Pt) were used to determine the pressure and temperature by X-ray diffraction from the respective equations of state. After verifying the liquid state of the sample by X-ray diffraction, absorption scans of the assembly were collected. The density of the melts was derived from the collected absorption scans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion:</head><p>The derived densities and the fitted equation of state are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. As expected, the density increases with increasin pressure, but decreases with increasing water content. By fitting an equation of state to our experimental data, we can now, for the first time, accurately predict the density of andesitic melts as a function of pressure, temperature and water content (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications:</head><p>Combined with available literature data for other melt compositions, the experimental data collected within this proposal support a compositionally independent partial molar volume of water in silicate melts, at least within the currently attainable precision of the in situ measurements <ref type="bibr">(Malfait et al., accepted)</ref>. This observation greatly simplifies the construction of future models for magma density. Based on the experimental data collected at ID27 of ESRF over the last couple of years <ref type="bibr">(Seifert et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Malfait et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Malfait et al., accepted)</ref>, we have constructed a predictive model for the density of geological melts <ref type="bibr">(Malfait et al., submitted)</ref>. This model will have a wide range of applications in volcanology and igneous petrology.</p></div>
