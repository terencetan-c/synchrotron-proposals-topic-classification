<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples measured</head><p>The samples measured were pure fats (PO, AMF, HPKS as reference) or suspensions consisting of these fats and various food related particles (concentrations varying between 10-60%). Additionally, sucrose esters were added as emulsifiers.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: different X-ray scattering length scales and their use to elucidate the fat crystal network</p><p>Research subject Within the Food Structure &amp; Function Research Group, the study of fats, and their polymorphic behavior is a main research activity. Different X-ray scattering techniques can be used to elucidate the fat crystal network (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>; left shows build-up of fat crystal network; right shows different X-ray scattering length scales and their use for elucidation of fat crystal network). Special interest is put into the investigation of the mesoscale structure, including nanoplatelet size and aggregation. Therefore, the use of USAXS is of great interest as information can be obtained after fitting of the results with Unified fit or Guinier-Porod model.</p><p>Set-up of the measurement Samples were measured in two ways. A first set of samples was crystallized at a temperature of 0, 20 or 25°C. Samples were put between Kapton sheets to measure pre-crystallized samles to ensure efficient use of precious beamtime. The second set of samples was heated and cooled to 20°C in a capillary holder at the beamline. As such, crystallization during cooling (1 or 20°C/min) could be followed. The beamline is very well equipped with sample preparation material and can provide many different sample holders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental problems</head><p>We were able to execute most of the planned experiments, although some measuring issues were unforseen.</p><p>As the samples are suspensions, containing particles with an average diameter around 30 µm, the very low USAXS region (StoD 31 m) got saturated and a new mask needed to be installed, cutting the lower edge of the USAXS results. This is a drawback in fitting the results as a lot of information is lost. Moreover, also in the higher q-region of USAXS information is lost due to the appearance of secondary scattering peaks. breakdowns in the beamline intensity were faced (including failure of the vacuum gauge that switched off the full synchrotron). The fact that data cannot be visualized as I(q), and only as 2D image, makes it difficult to judge the quality of results on the spot. Middle: shape of old and new mask applied. Right: red = sample with particles, suffering from secondary scattering, black = sample without particles, not suffering from secondary scattering. Outcomes Thanks to the experimental time at ID02, the possible use of USAXS for understanding crystallization of suspensions could be estimated. Nonetheless, the above described difficulties, the research has still proven to be successful. Further detailed research findings are kept confidential not to compromise on any publications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publications</head><p>Submission of a publication from the data obtained during experimental session ME1606 is expected, however, data must be put together with other experimental data from own laboratory (DSC, PLM, NMR, rheology…). Outcome expected end 2022.</p></div>

William Chevremeont for the continuous help provided during the research stay.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Left: red = result of USAXS with old mask applied, black = result of USAXS with new mask applied.Middle: shape of old and new mask applied.
