<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: The Molecular Structure of Cystatin Amyloid Fibrils. Experiment number: MD281 Beamline: ID26 Date of experiment: from: 16/05/07 to: 22/05/07 Date of report: 29/08/07 Shifts: 17 Local contact(s): Dr. Tsu-Chien Weng Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr R.A. Staniforth -University of Sheffield Dr C. Jelinska* -University of Sheffield Miss C. Sharma* -University of Sheffield Mr. R. Paramore* -University of Sheffield Report:</p><p>Using Sulfur K-edge XANES we were able to quantify disulfide crosslinks formed within amyloid fibrils of H.Cystatin B for 5 different double cysteine mutants (S7C/S45C, Q17C/A40C, Q46C/N52C, T51C/Q71C and Q71C/L80C. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The pairs of cysteine residues were engineered at loci where native contacts are formed in the 3-dimensional crystal structure of H.Cystatin B. In order to determine the extent to which these contacts are preserved within H.Cystatin B amyloid, fibrils were grown under reducing conditions and then oxidised by exposure to air (labelled 'degassed'), diamide or peroxide prior to measurement of Sulfur K-edge XANES spectra. I II III IV V</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All Sulfur K-edge XANES spectra were calibrated to thiosulfate at</p><p>Reference compounds and controls (Wild-type spectra): Reference spectra were collected for a number of compounds relating to the various oxidation states of sulfur expected in our protein samples; methionine, methionine sulfoxide, reduced glutathione, oxidised glutathione and cysteic acid. Wild-type H Cystatin B contains no cysteine but has two methionines. Methionine is oxidised to methionine sulfoxide by peroxide. Exposure to air or diamide has no effect. The wild-type spectra were used to fit the data in linear combination with reference spectra for reduced/oxidised glutathione and cysteic acid.</p><p>S7C/S45C: This mutant was designed to probe whether or not native contacts between strands 1 and 2 are maintained within the fibril structure. Upon fitting the spectra we found that all of the cysteine present had been oxidised to cystine. This result implies that the native contact between strands 1 and 2 is preserved within the fibril structure.</p><p>Q17C/A40C: This mutant was designed to probe whether native contacts between the α-helix and strand 2 are maintained within the fibril structure. Upon fitting the data, we found that 70% of the cysteine was oxidised to cystine, whilst 30% remained reduced.</p><p>Q46C/N52C: This mutant was designed to probe whether native contacts between strand 2 and 3 are preserved within the fibril structure. This is particularly important as the protein domain swaps across this interface to form dimers, a process which has been suggested to be important in fibrilisation. We found that all of the cysteine had been oxidised to cystine, implying that the contact is preserved within the fibril structure.</p><p>T51C/Q71C: Upon fitting the spectra obtained for this mutant we found that all the cysteine present had been oxidised to cystine, imlying that the contact between strands 3 and 4 is preserved within the fibril structure.</p><p>Q71C/L80C: We found that 75% of the cysteine present had been oxidised to cystine whilst 25% remained reduced.</p><p>2.484 2.482 2.48 2.478 2.476 2.474 2.472 2.47 2.468 2.466 6 4 2 0 keV Absorbance (a.u.) wt degassed wt diamide wt peroxide 2.484 2.482 2.48 2.478 2.476 2.474 2.472 2.47 2.468 2.466 4 3 2 1 0 -1 keV Absorbance (a.u.)
