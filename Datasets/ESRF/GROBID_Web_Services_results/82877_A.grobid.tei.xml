<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Understanding sulphur dissolution and re-deposition and microstructural evolution in lithium sulphur batteries by in operando X-ray diffraction computed tomography </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Lithium sulphur (Li-S) batteries offer superior theoretical specific capacity, lower cost and enhanced safety compared to incumbent Li-ion battery technology. However, the multiple reaction stages and phase changes result in a multitude of challenges including active material loss that significantly impact cycling life.</p><p>Through the 3D visualization of the sulphur cathode, a wealth of information such as microstructural evolution of the different phases at various states of charge (SoC) with cycling can be obtained. In operando techniques, only achievable at synchrotron sources, allow sufficiently high temporal resolution to enable visualization at different SoC by negating self-discharge issues significant in Li-S cells. In this experiment, we have used high temporal resolution synchrotron XRD-CT to capture the microstructural evolution of sulphur particles and carbon host and chemical transition of elemental sulphur (S) to lithium sulfide (Li 2 S) as a function of state of charge.</p><p>At ID15 we achieved a better than 1 µm x 1 µm monochromatic beam at 50 keV, and an acquisition rate of up to 100 Hz using the detector with the set-up shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> For both configurations, coarse scans of the whole cell with 20 µm step size were acquired alongside smaller regions of interest with 1 µm step size. However, we were unable to complete the full set of experiments planned for this beamtime despite the best efforts of the beamline staff (who went out of their way to resolve this issue, even at odd hours) due to severe networking issues with the ESRF cluster that was beyond their control. This resulted in the frequent occurrence of missed frames during acquisitions that required repeat measurements.</p><p>Preliminary reconstructions of the coarse whole cell scans are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Chun Tan (University College London) Paul Shearing (PI) (University College London)</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>(a). The high speed photon counting Pilatus Dectris CdTe 2M detector available at the ESRF, in combination with our bespoke XRD-CT cell fabricated in PEEK as shown in Figure 1(b) and (c), enabled us to reach an acquisition rate of up to 100 Hz per raster point. As illustrated in Figure 1(b), the PEEK cell body was narrowed down to 2.5 mm outer diameter, containing an elemental sulfur cathode and lithium metal anode of ca. 1.5 mm diameter to maximize the signal to noise ratio of the resulting diffraction patterns. In one experiemental configuration, XRD-CT slices of the sulfur electrode were acquired in-situ at regular intervals of SoC, along with complementary absorption CT tomograms at 100% and 0% SoC. In another experimental configuration, XRD-CT volumes were throughout the depth of the electrode as a function of SoC to study depth related microstructural evolution.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><figDesc>Figure 2(a), and what we believe to be crystalline Li 2 S in the fully discharged cell in Figure 2(b). Whilst the nano-sized Li 2 S crystals formed during discharge are below the spatial resolution of this technique, we expect to be able to observe volume averaged diffraction patterns characteristic of Li 2 S within each voxel. The high flux and high energy capabilities of ID15, and the expertise and deep involvement of the ID15A beamline staff, especially Marco Di Michiel and Antony Vamvakeros, contributed significantly to make this novel experiment possible.</figDesc></figure>
