<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The inspection of the difference Fourier map allowed localizing glycine molecules inside the 12MR channel. The glycine atoms occupy five crystallographycally independent partially occupied sites, all lying on the (100) plane. On the basis of the occupancy factor of these atoms (~0.32) and of the multiplicity of the positions (4) it is possible to calculate that 1.3 molecules p.u.c are hosted in Na-MOR. Each glycine molecule coordinates one Na cation via the carboxyl group and a framework oxygen atom via the amino group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>-left). The structural refinement shows a disposition of glycine molecules promising for the promotion of the condensation reaction. In fact, considering a full occupancy of each site and the steric hindrance of the atoms, two glycine molecules could be hosted in each channel of a unit cell (figure 1-right), accounting for a total of 4 glycine molecules p.u.c. In this configuration, the distance between two equivalents glycine molecules in the channels is suitable for the peptide formation. However, as stated above, the amount of glycine inside the channels after vapor loading is about 1.3 molecules p.u.c., this means that the probability of finding two neighbor glycine molecules simultaneously present in the same channel is too low. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Na-MOR+gly sample at high pressure:</head><p>The structural refinement was possible only on the patterns collected on Na-MOR+gly in the non-penetrating PTM Daphne oil at Pamb and after pressure release (Pmax 2.7 GPa). The pressure treatment only induces slight variations on the glycine molecules and framework position. Specifically, the pressure induces the deformation of the 12MR channel along the b axis and reduces the coordination distances between the carboxyl group of the glycine and the sodium cation, because of a slight shift of the molecules. Due to the bad quality of the data, consequence of a slight pressure-induced loss of crystallinity of zeolite during the pressure treatment, it was impossible to follow the structural evolution of the system at high pressure. However, it is possible to state that, whatever the structural modifications the system underwent at HP, they resulted quite reversible after the pressure release, in fact the amino acid molecules disposition is not far from the initial one. The variation of the c parameter, at the highest-investigated pressure, is about 3.6%. Concerning the HP experiment using Ar as penetrating PTM, a higher electronic density was found in the channels, even in the first pressure point investigated (0.07 GPa) suggesting the penetration of Ar inside the pores. The amount of Ar increases with the pressure, hindering a straightforward interpretation of the difference Fourier maxima, due to the high scattering factor of the Ar atoms in comparison with that of the organic molecules. Because of the complexity of the system, the structural analysis on these X-ray diffraction data is really challenging and it not possible to evaluate if the penetration of Ar atoms in the zeolite porosity may induce an approach of the molecules or further hinders the diffusion of the glycine molecules. The unit cell volume evolution in funcion of pressure are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for both experiments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Na-MOR+αala sample</head><p>The Rietveld refinement of Na-MOR+αala sample was very challenging, due to the presence of maxima in the difference electron density map attributable to alanine molecules and/or to H2O molecules strongly correlating each other. For the above-mentioned reasons, an accurate localization and quantification of the amino acid molecules was not possible. Overall, it is possible to asses, with a certain degree of confidence, that α-alanine molecules are located in the 12MR channel coordinating Na cations, similarly to the glycine molecule in the previous sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Na-MOR+αala sample at high pressure</head><p>The variation of the unit cell volume as a function of P are reported for both HP experiments in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The data were refined with the Le Bail method for both experiments in the whole pressure range. When compressed in Daphne oil, Na-MOR+αala volume cell experiences a maximum variation at 3 GPa of 14.2%, while when compressed in Ar, the maximum variation at 2.1 GPa is 2.8%. Comparing the unit cell volume behaviour in the various HP experiments, the Na-MOR+gly sample results in both experiments more compressible than the Na-MOR+αala sample in the respective PTM. This behaviour well agrees with a higher degree of pores filling in Na-MOR+αala sample.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Left) View of the 12MR channel containing the glycine molecules.
