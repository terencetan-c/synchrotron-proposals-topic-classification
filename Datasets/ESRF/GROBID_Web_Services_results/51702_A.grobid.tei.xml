<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Thanks to the good eletronic contrast between organic polymers and silica, we successfully measured on ID02 the dispersion of fillers in various nanocomposite systems. Rubber nanocomposites and acrylate latex nanocomposites filled with silica nanoparticles were measured. Two configurations were used:</p><p>-=10Å , Sample-Detector distance = 2.5m to scan the q range [3.5.10 -3 to 0.15 Å -1 ] Å -1 .</p><p>-The USAXS setup with the Bonse-Hart camera to reach the q min value 10 -4 Å -1 . The 2D-data recorded were then processed, using the software SAXS-Utilities avalaible on place. The isotropic average of these scattering patterns around the center of scattering allows to reduce the resulting data to a one-dimension output I(q), with q²=q x ²+q y ². For isotropic sample, the 2D-patterns show a circular symmetry. So, isotropic averaging was done on complete circles. Some samples were measured at stretched state. The resulting 2D-patterns show two axis of symmetry along the two main directions of stretching (the PARAllel one and the PERPendicular one). Data averaging was done along these two directions in 20° bissectors. For each strain rate, we obtained thus a pair of spectra : I PARA (q) (resp. I PERP (q)) shows the local reorganizations in the parallel (resp. perpendicular) direction of stretching.</p><p>As more than 200 samples were measured during this experiment, only few results are reported here.</p><p>Within the framework of Ph.D thesis in partnership with Michelin, we have developed an original solvent casting process allowing the formulation of "model" nanocomposites based on colloidal silica (Ludox TM40 Aldrich) and copolymer (SB). Previous SAXS results on model nanocomposites based on graftable SBR chains (D3) have shown that longer polymer chains (140 kg/mol compared to 40 kg/mol) lead to a better dispersion of the silica nanoparticles.</p><p>In this experiment, the silica state in ternary suspensions (silica + polymer + solvent: 2-Butanone) has been investigated for different chain lengths (40 and 140 kg/mol), in order to follow the aggregation kinetics. The filler fraction was varied from 0.55 to 5.7%vol with a constant polymer fraction R p =8%vol in the suspension. SAXS results obtained for 40kg/mol ternary suspensions are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Looking at the structure factor (Figs 1 b)), one can clearly see a repulsive peak which evolves with the silica fraction. The peak position characterizes the most probable distance between objects. From 0.55 to 1.1%vol silica, the peak is shifted towards larger angles suggesting a reduction of the inter-bead distance (e.g. adding particles). Then, from 1.1% to 5.7%vol silica, the behavior is opposite with an increase of the inter-bead distance. In this case, the elementary beads form aggregates, and the aggregates centers of mass are separated by larger distances. The same trend is observed for both polymer masses. From a simple cubic model it is possible to evaluate the mean aggregation number in the suspension. These results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0 1 2 3 0.004 0.007 0.01 0.55%v 1.1%v 2.7%v 5.7%v S(q) = I(q) /  si / P(q) q (Å -1 ) q*=3.97e -3 Å -1 q*=5.59e -3 Å -1 q*=6.20e -3 Å -1 q*=5.05e -3 Å -1 40 kg/mol</formula><p>Model systems based on non-graftable SBR chains (NF) were studied at rest and under uniaxiale traction. At rest, dispersion was studied with the type of dispersing agent as the main input: tuned by OCTEO on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), tuned by Si69 on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The shoulders pointed by the arrows on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> show the presence of primary aggregates (aggregation of primary Ludox nanoparticles) : this structure is highly sensible to the type of dispersing agent. An adequate analytical model allowed us to describe more quantitatively this agent effect. The best fits of the aggregate form factor P Agg are shown in plain black curves on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> : primary aggregate morphology is independent on silica fraction, but it is smaller and denser with TESPT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>)) than with OCTEO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1 : Ludox silica dispersion in SBR matrix with increasing silica fraction a) tuned by OCTEO ; b) tuned by Si69</head><p>Moreover, the greater increase in scattering at lowest q with Si69 shows that that the primary aggregates organize in a denser network than with OCTEO.</p><p>At stretched state, we can observe two main tendencies with increasing strain rate L, illustrated on the example of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Below 0,008Å -1 , we observe in general the deformation of spatial correlations between primary aggregates. In the PARAllel direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>)), the decrease in scattering shows the decrease in the compactness of the primary aggregate network. By comparison, in the PERP direction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>)), we observe only very slight compaction of the primary aggregate network. In the [0,008 ; 0,04]Å -1 range corresponding to the primary aggregate form factor, changes in scattering with L show that the primary aggregate is modified under traction. However, following quantitatively the evolution in the aggregate form factor with our previous analytical model applied on each pair of spectra is a challenge.</p><p>Model nanocomposites made from casting of colloidal silica (Ludox TM40 Aldrich) and polyethylmethacrylate (PEMA) nanolattices were also studied. In this experiment the effects of the filler content and the molecular weight of PEMA (20kg/mol, 50kg/mol and 160kg/mol) were investigated. SAXS spectra normalised by the filler volume fraction are displayed in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. These curves display several striking features. First, the high-q data superimpose nicely as expected for identical silica NPs in all samples. Secondly, a common power law is observed at intermediate q, i.e. below ca. 2.3 10 -2 Å -1 . The exponent lies between -2.3 and -2.4, and it is identical for all three polymer masses. This power-law indicates a common organization of aggregates, with a typical fractal dimension of 2.4. What differs, however, is the extent of the fractal domain. At low chain masses, for 20 and 50 kg/mol, it ranges down to ca. 6 10 -3 Å -1 , i.e. covers approximately a factor of four in q-range. At the highest mass of 160 kg/mol, the power law is much shorter, covering only a factor of 2 in q-range. The shorter power-law regime suggests that aggregates are smaller, and organize differently on larger scales.</p><p>Finally, during this experiment, some tests were also performed on visco-elastic gluten proteins gels to get information about their structure. Data were successfully fitted with models of semi-dilute polymers combined with a fractal structure at larger length scale.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Structural evolution of ternary suspensions as a function of the filler fraction for 40kg/mol SB.
