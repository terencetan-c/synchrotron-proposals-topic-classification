<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High-resolution monochromatic beam X-ray section topography in-situ with an applied electric field was used to study the electrostrictive distortions in RbTiOAsO 4 (RTA) single crystals. Previous experiments focused on in-situ white-beam section topography, results of which which suggested the presence of a depletion region in the near-surface under large electric fields. This implied that RTA should be treated as a semiconductor ferroelectric. However, the magnitude of the strain developed in this region under large fields was not determined directly in white-beam mode. The monochromatic work was highly successful and clarified a number of points regarding the semiconducting nature of RTA, including a direct measurement of the strain in the near-surface depletion region. A paper has been submitted to the Journal of Applied Crystallography (January 8th 2007, reference fe5019) entitled "In-situ investigation of the non-linear optical crystal Rubidium Titanyl Arsenate, RbTiOAsO 4 , under applied electric field using X-Ray imaging". The abstract of the paper reads as follows:</p><p>Recent work on the nonlinear optical single crystal rubidium titanyl arsenate (RbTiOAsO 4 , RTA) has shown that it exhibits behaviour consistent with a ferroelectric-semiconductor under large applied electric fields, with the development of a non-uniform field in the near-surface region. To confirm aspects of the proposed model, the behaviour of (0 0 1) slices of initially single-domain RTA, patterned with periodic Ag electrodes of spacing 38µm as for periodic poling in nonlinear optics, are investigated using synchrotron X-ray section topography with the electric-field applied in-situ while under X-ray illumination at the ID19 topography beamline of the ESRF, Grenoble. The results of white-beam section topography as both a function of crystal to film distance, and under DC voltage are reported, confirming that there is a bending of the planes in the near-surface region. The strain in the near-surface region was examined directly using high-resolution monochromatic X-ray section topography. This revealed an extensive strain of 3(±1) x 10 -4 at 1kV, indicating that the electrostrictive coefficient, γ 3333 , in RTA is positive in sign.</p></div>		</body>
