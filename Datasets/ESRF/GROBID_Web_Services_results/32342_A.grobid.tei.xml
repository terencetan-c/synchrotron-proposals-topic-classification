<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>In synovial joints the bone is covered by a thin layer of articular cartilage that provides a low-friction bearing surface and acts as a shock-absorber. The main structural element of cartilage is a highly organised network of Type II collagen fibres, maintained in tension by an osmotic, or swelling, pressure generated by a viscoelastic gel of highly anionic proteoglycans that fills the voids in the collagen network. The collagen fibres run parallel to the articular surface in the tangential layer of cartilage, are isotropically oriented in the transitional zone and, in the radial zone overlying the bone, run perpendicular to the interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Stockwell 1979)</ref>. The interface between cartilage and bone comprises a zone of calcified cartilage bounded above by the tide mark and below by the cement line. In the calcified cartilage mineralised Type II collagen fibrils are arranged predominantly perpendicular to the articular. The mineral comprises mainly of calcium apatite, but its organisation and relationship to collagen fibres have only recently been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Zizak et al 2003)</ref>. This layer is believed to be a mechanically important interface in matching the disparate properties of bone and cartilage.</p><p>The aims of our research were to further chacterise, using SAXS, the structure of articular cartilage and the calicifed cartilage in different regions of the equine metacopophalangeal joint and explore the relationships between the structural differences regional differences in joint loading. A second aim was to quantify structural changes associated with the application of mechanical loads to the joint. The final aim was to characterise cartilage structure in osteoarthritic lesions and to compare the loading response of lesions to that of healthy tissue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>A cross section of bone and articular cartilage, cut longitudinally and approximately 1-2mm thick, was taken from the metacarpolphalangal joints of horses, immediately post mortem in horses undergoing euthanasia. The samples were mounted in a custom-made loading apparatus on beamline ID18F and SAXS diffraction patterns were acquired at 25Âµm interverals passing from the cartilage surface through the calcified cartilage into the bone. Measurements were made at different sites around the articular surface including both normal tissue and lesions. At each location a series of measurements were performed as increasing compressive loads were applied to the cartilage surface. A small number of area scans were performed in order to investigate the lateral spread of strain through the joint under the applied load. Area scans were also performed on lesions to investigate local changes in micromechanical properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The experiments provided a rich body of data. The analysis of collagen structure has been completed and the analysis of the mineral component is in progress.</p><p>Regional variations in collagen structure have been revealed over the articular surface, which can be correlated with the regional loading patterns in-vivo. Notably, areas of the joint that receive the most load appear to have greater order in the radial zone. In lesions this order is lost with the progresion of the lesion. Changes also occur in cartilage structure as deep as the subchondral bone and these changes are especially apparent in samples where the cartilage surface has been lost due to severe progression of disease. These findings have been accepted for presentation at the World Congess of Biomechanics and full papers will be submitted shortly.</p><p>The effects of load on collagen organisation have also been analysed. In normal tissue, the transitional and tangential zones of the cartilage compress initally when a surface stress of approximately 60 kPa is applied. This compression reaches a limit above this load and with further increase in load the fibres in the deep radial zone, as deep as the zone of calified cartilage, reorientate and there is a loss of order, tentatively ascribed to fibre 'buckling'.</p><p>Applying comparable loads to lesions caused fibre breakage in the upper radial zone and fibre buckling was not observed implying that fibre breakage prevents the propagation of strains into the deeper tissue. These findings are also being prepared for publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>Although the data analysis is still incomplete and important questions relating to the mechanical coupling of collagen and mineral remain to be addressed the preliminary analysis has provided important new insights into cartilage micromechanics that would be difficult to obtain by other techniques.</p></div>		</body>
