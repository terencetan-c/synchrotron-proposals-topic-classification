<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>By this experimental report, we tend to give a brief overview on representative results and general aspects that may be deduced from the scattering data collected at ID02 between the 3 rd and 5 th September 2010. Data evaluation is not yet entirely completed and will still keep us busy for while.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aggregation process of anionic azo dyestuffs in the presence of strontium and barium cations has been followed by time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Aggregation was initiated by combining aqueous solutions of dyestuff and the chlorides of the earth alkaline metals. To achieve a well defined start and the feasibility to record the scattering during the first second of the aggregation process, mixing of components was performed by means of a stopped-flow device. SAXS measurements were performed on samples with different dyestuff-to-metal ratios at detector distances of 10 m, 5 m and 1 m. 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 q -4 q -4 I / m -1 q / m -1 t = 0.03 s t = 0.08 s t = 0.18 s t = 0.32 s t = 4 s q Figure 2: Representative scattering patterns recorded at 1 m detector distance (A) and the evolution of the extracted size parameter R g (B).</p><p>A representative set of scattering curves measured at 10 m detector distance is shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In the underlying experiment, the dyestuff was 0.33 g/l and the barium concentration was 1.6 mM. The first curve recorded just ~ 30 ms after mixing the components already exhibits a q -4 decrease at 0.1 nm -1 , which probably denotes the existence of large micells the Guinier regime of which is not captured by the present q-regime. In the middle q range, scattering intensity increases strongly within the first half second, and the representative curves recorded at 80, 180 and 320 ms exhibit a distinct q -1 decrease. This indicates the growth of local rodlike structures by a very fast aggregation process. At high q, even a Porod regime becomes apparent for curves recorded after 320 ms. However, the corresponding q-regime is captured superiorly at 1 m detector distance. For measurements at 1 m detector distance, a representative set of scattering curves is shown in figure <ref type="figure">2 (A</ref>). Here, the dyestuff was 0.33 g/l and the barium concentration was 0.8 mM. The curves illustrate how the Porod regime is shifted to smaller q over the time. This aspect may be interpreted by a growing cross-section of cylindrical structures. The "Guinier regime" of the cross-section of cylindrical structures is situated at slightly lower q than the Porod regime which represents the curved surface. It generally superposes with the typical q -1 decrease of the rod-like structure. Thus a more quantitative analysis of the trend illustrated in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (A) can be performed by means of a plot ln(q*I(q)) versus q 2 . In this plot mode, the curves indeed exhibit a pronounced "Guinier regime". The corresponding size parameter may be interpreted as the radius of gyration (R g ) of a cylinder cross-section. Its evolution is illustrated in figure 2 (B) and denotes a decreasing growth from 1 to around 3.5 nanometers.</p><p>0 1 2 3 4 5 0.0 1.0x10 -9 2.0x10 -9 3.0x10 -9 4.0x10 -9 B R g / m time / s 10 8 10 9 10 10 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 q -4 I / m -1 q / m -1 t = 0.03 s t = 0.23 s t = 1.23 s t = 20 s q -1 A</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Representative set of scattering curves recorded at 10 m detector distance.</figDesc></figure>
