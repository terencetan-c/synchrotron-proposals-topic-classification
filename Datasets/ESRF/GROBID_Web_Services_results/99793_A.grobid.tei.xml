<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>(Notes: The originally allocated beamtime under proposal number CH-6315 was planned for an experiment on the photoredox reaction of the europium complex. However, at that time, the synthesis of the europium complex was not completed on schedule. So, we asked for permission from the beamline manager and experimented with the wavelength-dependent photodissociation dynamics of CF2I2, originally planned as a backup sample.)</p><p>The goal of our experiment was to study the photodissociation pathways of diiododifluoromethane (CF2I2) and how they depend on excitation wavelength. In previous spectroscopic studies, it has been known that CF2I2 exhibits two-body, three-body, or a mixture of both photodissociation pathways depending on the excitation wavelength. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) Depending on the photodissociation pathway, CF2I2 can release one or both iodine atoms, and it is anticipated that different intermediates will be captured in these two pathways. In this work, we utilized time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TRXSS), a prominent tool to visualize the structural dynamics in liquids and solutions, to precisely extract the structure of each intermediate. We conducted the TRXSS measurement of 30 mM CF2I2 @ cyclohexane in three different wavelengths: 267, 310, and 350 nm. The X-ray scattering signals from heated solvents were measured in a separate experiment using ferrocene solution, a well-known heating dye.</p><p>We azimuthally integrate the scattering images to obtain a set of static 1D curves that have momentum (q) as the x-axis. Then, we subtracted the curves collected at positive time delays from those at negative time delays to generate difference x-ray scattering curves. Also, we removed the contribution of the solvent heating signal by using structural components extracted from the separate experiment using ferrocene solution. Finally, we performed a singular value decomposition (SVD) to decompose the collected data Î”S(q,t) into time-independent structural components (U(q)), their temporal evolutions (V(t)) and relative importance in the data (S).</p><p>The experimental results of the TRXSS data of CF2I2 at 267, 310, and 350 nm in cyclohexane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>-3) were summarized. We concluded that structure components are similar regardless of the excitation wavelength but different in their temporal evolution. Further analysis is required to clarify the wavelengthdependent photodissociation pathways and time profile variations. Details of the analysis are still ongoing, and we plan to publish the results in a scientific paper in the future.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
