<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The findings of the mentioned experiment (together with the earlier experiment HS/4421) are reported in the following publication, which is recently accepted: Ors, T., Takakura, H., Abe, E. &amp; Steurer, W. ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>). Acta Cryst. B70, doi:10.1107/S2052520614001115.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>A single crystal X-ray diffraction structure analysis of decagonal Zn-Mg-Dy, a Frank-Kaspertype quasicrystal, was performed using the higher-dimensional approach. For this first Frank-Kasper (F-K) decagonal quasicrystal studied so far, significant differences to the decagonal Al-TM (TM: transition metal) based phases were found. A new type of 2-fold occupation domain is located on certain edge centers of the five-dimensional (5D) unit cell. The structure can be described in terms of a two-cluster model based on a decagonal cluster (≈23 Å diameter) arranged on the vertices of a pentagon-Penrose tiling (PPT) and a star-like cluster covering the remaining space. This model is used for the 5D refinements, which converged to an R-value of 12.6%. The arrangement of clusters is significantly disordered as indicated by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM).</p><p>In order to check structure and stability at higher temperatures, in-situ high-temperature (HT) single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted at 598 K and 648 K (i.e. slightly below the decomposition temperature). The structure does not change significantly, however, the best quasiperiodic order is found at 598 K. The implication of these results on the stabilization mechanism of quasicrystals is discussed.</p></div>			</div>
