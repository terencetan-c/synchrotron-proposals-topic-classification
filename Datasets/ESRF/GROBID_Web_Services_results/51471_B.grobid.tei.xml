<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We aim at determining the melting properties of a silicate + CO 2 system at high pressure and temperature. Classical studies have only investigated melting upon heating, using the quench method. However, peculiarities of the silicate + CO 2 phase diagram have been reported, which seem to point out a transition from supercritical CO 2 -fluid to carbonatitic-melt as pressure is increased. We propose to bracket the fluid / melt transition in order to better constrain the topology of the silicate + CO 2 melting diagram and better refine the consequences for melting processes in the Earth's mantle as well as carbon emission from the deep mantle.</p><p>During the 17 shift time period, we have performed 7 successful high pressure runs. The first two runs allowed us to define the best sample container. For MgO container, we noted reaction with the sample. From run 3 on, we therefore only used graphite.</p><p>We were able to perform the first in-situ detection of the dolomite decarbonation boundary [dolomite + SiO2 = diopside] upon heating at low pressure (&lt;2.5 GPa) in the peridotitic system. Next, we detected melting at P &gt; 3.9 GPa. We performed several runs to closely bracket the phase relationships. In one instance, we were able to evidence carbonate melt degassing upon decompression.</p><p>In conclusion, we have refined the peridotite + CO 2 phase relationships using high pressure, in situ X-ray diffraction. We have demonstrated CO 2 degassing. A manuscript is currently being written.</p></div>
