During the preparatory experiments in the months prior to the beam time, we found however that the processes are not reproducible. Apparently different batches of Ag precursor as obtained from the manufacturer yield different scientific results. Therefore, we decided not to waste valuable beam time on an extensive in situ study of these non-reproducible processes. Instead, we selected a series of samples prepared in our lab and measured them ex situ (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). With the remaining time, we continued the in situ Pt ALD and annealing experiments (26-02-672/-709/-726) and obtained interesting data sets that will allow us to finalize manuscripts that are in preparation on these topics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A selection of GISAXS data measured on the Ag samples is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For the H 2plasma process at 75 cycles we observe multiple scattering maxima along q z , which means that there is a good height correlation between different particles. For the sample at 200 cycles we observe a single pair of maxima, which are lying closer along q y . This means that the inter particle spacing is larger and the particles are larger. In contrast, we have not observed any scattering maxima for the samples grown by the NH 3 -plasma process. Hence, the variation in particle size and height is too strong for these samples, and we are not able to determine an average particle height or spacing. Table 1.

We focused on the effect of (1) the initial particle morphology and (2) the environmental O 2 concentration on the particle coarsening during the thermal annealing procedure. To this end, we prepared four distinct Pt samples with similar Pt loading but different as-deposited morphology onto a SiO 2 substrate via ALD. GISAXS corroborated the distinct initial particle morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (left)). First, all samples were annealed in 18% O 2 in He up to 800ºC (0.2 ºC/s). By following the GISAXS peak position, q y,max , we approximated the change in average center-to-center particle distance, D=2π/q y,max . An increase in D is indicative of particle sintering. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (middle) reveals that the onset temperature for particle coarsening depends on the initial particle morphology: smaller nanoparticles (with smaller center-to-center particle distance) sinter at lower temperature than the larger ones. In addition, the morphology of the supported Pt nanoparticles at high temperatures (&gt; 650˚C) is observed to be independent of the initial particle morphology. Second, pieces of the same as-deposited samples were also annealed in 1.4% and 0.07% O 2 in He up to 950ºC to study the effect of the oxygen concentration on the Pt sintering behavior. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (right) shows the results for the largest as-deposited nanoparticles (with the largest center-to-center particle distance). We observe a decrease in onset temperature for particle coarsening with decreasing O 2 concentration. A more pronounced difference, however, is that a higher O 2 concentration results in larger particles at high temperatures (&gt; 650˚C), while for the lowest concentration a "stability plateau" is observed where no further particle sintering occurs.</p><p>In situ study of Pt ALD -As an extension of previous campaigns (26-02-672/-709), we have performed in situ GISAXS and XRF measurements during the initial growth stages of Pt ALD processes. We focused on the role of the Pt precursor dose on the nucleation and particle growth during the MeCpPtMe 3 /O 2 ALD process at 300˚C. XRF and GISAXS revealed a decreasing growth rate with decreasing precursor pressure during both the nucleation and growth phase. On the other hand, GISAXS patterns obtained for the same Pt loading were identical. This indicates that, for a certain number of Pt atoms deposited on the surface, the particle shape, dimensions and areal density are equal irrespective of the precursor dose used in the ALD process. This can be understood based on our earlier findings that atom surface diffusion plays an important role during the O 2 -based ALD process.</p><p>Conclusions: Although we could not execute the original beam time proposal due to reproducibility issues with the Ag PE-ALD processes, the campaign has been very successful. We collected a large amount of data for different ongoing projects in the group (ex situ Ag ALD characterization, in situ Pt annealing, and in situ Pt ALD). The results will allow us to finalize several manuscripts that are in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
