<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural studies of ovine recombinant prion protein</head><p>PrPc is an ubiquituous cell surface glycoprotein of unknown function expressed in numerous mammal species. Conversion of this protein from its cellular form (PrPc) to insoluble amyloïd fibrils (PrPSc) is the main event of prion diseases, a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that appear sporadically as well as after hereditary or infectious transmission.</p><p>Prion infectious agent is mainly composed of PrPSc and seems devoid of nucleic acid, a feature that makes this group of diseases exceptional. Spreading of prion into challenged organisms requires expression of cell host PrPc, and is modulated by several mutations in the PrP gene. In particular, three polymorphisms in the prnp ovine gene (at position 136, 154 and 171 in ovine PrP) strongly influence the susceptibility of animals to scrapie. Sheep homozygous for the A136R154R171 (ARR) allele are resistant to scrapie whereas V136R154Q171 (VRQ) homozygous animals are highly susceptible. A previous visit at BM30 allowed us to solve the structure of ARQ variant, and in order to get insight into the effect of the pathogenic R171Q substitution in ovPrP structure, we grew crystals of ARR(114-234) variant in complex with VRQ14 Fab. No diffraction was observed for these crystals, most likely because of their small size relative to previously tested prion-Fab crystals.</p><p>We also tested crystals constituted of an antibody capable of recognizing selectively PrPSc. Space group is P212121 (a=38 Å, b=93 Å, c=121 Å). Data were measured to 2,5 Å (Rmerge : 8,2 %). The structure was solved using molecular replacement.</p></div>			</div>
