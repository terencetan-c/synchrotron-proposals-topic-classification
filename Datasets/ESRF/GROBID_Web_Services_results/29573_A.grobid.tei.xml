Adams; "Three-dimensional trace element analysis by confocal X-ray microfluorescence imaging"; Analytical Chemistry 76 ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), 6786-6791, 2004. Abstract. A three-dimensional (3D) variant of scanning micro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is described and evaluated at the ID18F instrument of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The method is based on confocal excitation/detection using a polycapillary half-lens in front of the energy dispersive detector. The experimental arrangement represents a significant generalization of regular twodimensional (2D) scanning micro-XRF and employs a detector half-lens whose focus coincides with that of the focused incoming beam. The detection volume defined by the intersection of the exciting beam and the energy dependent acceptance of the polycapillary optics is 100-350 µm 3 . Minimum detection limits are sub-ppm and sensitivities are comparable with regular scanning XRF. Next to the reduction of in-sample single/multiple scattering, the set-up provides the possibility of sample depthscans with an energy dependent resolution of 10-35 µm in the energy range of 3-23 keV, and the possibility of performing 3D-XRF analysis by simple XYZ linear scanning. This provides a suitable alternative to X-ray fluorescence tomography. The method is illustrated with results of the analysis of solid inclusions in diamond and fluid inclusions in quartz. • B. Vekemans, L. Vincze, F. E. Brenker, F. and Adams; "Processing of three-dimensional microscopic Xray fluorescence data"; J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 19 (10), 1302 -1308, 2004. Abstract. A novel polycapillary based confocal X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique was applied for the first time at the ID18F beamline of the ESRF to obtain directly 3-dimensional (3D) compositional information of an inclusion inside a natural diamond sample (KK200). Preliminary analysis of the results on the basis of the trace elements Sr, Y/Zr, and Th suggest three phases, two of which were identified by earlier micro-Raman spectroscopy as larnite (β-Ca 2 SiO 4 ) and CaSiO 3 -walstromite, two minerals with significantly different Ca content. In order to support this multiphase model for the investigated inclusion the data set was analysed combining the conventional multivariate method of PCA and K-means clustering procedure after application of instrument specific routines such as spectral evaluation and normalization. Through the knowledge of the full spatial 3D structure of the different phases, it was possible to correct for absorption of the fluorescent radiation in the different phases of the inclusion and the surrounding diamond. • F.

Harris; "Evidence for a Ca-rich lithology in the Earth's deep upper mantle"; Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 2005, in press. Abstract. Earth's deep convecting upper mantle is believed to represent a rather homogenous geochemical reservoir of spinel or garnet lherzolite with primitive major element and moderately depleted trace element composition. Only where subduction occurs is this homogeneity disrupted by a suite of rocks ranging from eclogites/garnet pyroxenites (former oceanic crust) to residual harzburgites. In addition to these well documented peridotitic and metabasaltic rocks we have now discovered the presence of a chemically distinct reservoir in the deep upper mantle. In situ structural analyses (micro Xray diffraction and micro Raman spectroscopy) and three-dimensional trace element mapping (confocal micro X-ray fluorescence imaging) of polyphase inclusions in a diamond from Guinea that formed at about 300-360 km depth reveal the existence of a deep Ca-rich source, in the absence of several common mantle minerals, like olivine, garnet and Ca-poor pyroxene. This reservoir may represent metasomatized oceanic lithosphere (rodingites, ophicarbonates) or metamorphosed carbonaceous sediments. • R. Terzano, M. Spagnuolo, L. Medici, B. Vekemans, L.

This study deals with the process of zeolite formation in an agricultural soil artificially polluted by high amounts of Cu (15 mg of Cu/g of soil dry weight) and treated with fused coal fly ash at 30 and 60 °C and how this process affects the mobility and availability of the metal. As a consequence of the treatment, the amount of dissolved Cu, and thus its mobility, was strongly reduced, and the percentage of the metal stabilized in the solid phase increased over time, reaching values of 30% at 30 °C and 40% at 60 °C. The physicochemical phenomena responsible for Cu stabilization in the solid phase have been evaluated by EDTA sequential extractions and synchrotron radiation based X-ray microanalytical techniques. These techniques were used for the visualization of the spatial distribution and the speciation of Cu in and/or on the neo-formed zeolite particles. In particular, micro XRF (X-ray fluorescence) tomography showed direct evidence that Cu can be entrapped as clusters inside the porous zeolitic structures while í-XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) spectroscopy determinations revealed Cu to be present mainly as Cu(II) hydroxide and Cu(II) oxide. The reported results could be useful as a basic knowledge for planning new technologies for the on site physicochemical stabilization of heavy metals in heavily polluted soils.</p></div>
