<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Possible J=1/2 state in thin films of Ir-based double perovskites Sr2MnIrO6 Experiment number: HC 3251</p><p>Beamline:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Date of report:</head><p>02.11.17 Here, we report on investigation of the magnetic properties of epitaxial thin films of new Ir 4+ based compounds Sr2MnIrO6 and LaSrMnIrO6 with different epitaxial strain stabilized using pulsed laser deposition on SrTiO3, DyScO3, and (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2TaAlO6)0.7 substrates.</p><p>The total magnetic moments of Sr2MnIrO6 and LaSrMnIrO6 thin films on the SrTiO3 substrates were characterized using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The total magnetization curves for both compounds are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> as functions of the applied field (a, c) and temperature (b, d). The magnetization vs. field curves for both compounds display well defined hysteresis loops with different anisotropies and the saturation magnetizations of 0.4 and 0.6 μB/f.u. for the Sr2MnIrO6 and LaSrMnIrO6 thin films, respectively. In Sr2MnIrO6, interaction between anti-ferromagnetic insulator SrMnO3 and paramagnetic semi-metal SrIrO3 layers gives rise to a ferri-magnetic low-band gap insulating behaviour. As compared to Sr2MnIrO6, the La-doped LaSrMnIrO6 compound shows higher saturation magnetization and magnetic Curie temperature (Tc). In order to characterize the contribution of spin-orbit coupling and to compare the role of magnetism in Ir for both compounds, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements of the Sr2MnIrO6 and LaSrMnIrO6 thin films were performed at the Ir L2,3 x-ray absorption edges.</p><p>Absorption spectra were recorded using the total fluorescence yield detection mode. The XMCD spectra for both Sr2MnIrO6 and LaSrMnIrO6 films were obtained as direct difference between consecutive X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectrum (XANES) scans recorded with opposite helicities of the incoming x-ray beam. All measurements were performed at 5 K which is well below the observed Tc for both materials. The measured XANES spectra with the correspondent XMCD signals for Sr2MnIrO6 and LaSrMnIrO6 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> (e) and (f), respectively. For Sr2MnIrO6, we derived a positive XMCD signal with the corresponding spin magnetic moment of mspin  0.026 μB and orbital moment of morbital  0.004 μB (|morbital/mspin|  0.15) resulting in a total paramagnetic moment of mtot  0.030 μB per Ir atom. For LaSrMnIrO6, the negative XMCD signal has been observed and the total magnetic moment of Ir is aligned opposite to the net magnetization. Quantitavely, a spin magnetic moment of mspin  -0.201 μB and an orbital magnetic moment of morbital  0.129 μB were calculated using the sum rules, i.e. |morbital/mspin|  0.64 and mtot = -0.072 μB at the Ir-site. Thus, doping of Sr2MnIrO6 with La results in the Mn 3+ (3d 4 ) state in LaSrMnIrO6 with an extra eg electron, which is effectively hybridized with the Ir 5d shell leading to the observed induced negative total magnetic moment at the Ir-site.</p><p>In summary, based on our XMCD measurements, we confirm presence of an induced magnetic moment at the Ir-site in LaSrMnIrO6 due to hybridization of the eg electron between the Mn 3+ (3d 4 ) and Ir 4+ (5d 5 ) states.</p><p>Quantitative estimations of spin and orbital moment in the case of LaSrMnIrO6 confirm an unquenched orbital moment at the Ir-site, which contributes to the observed total magnetic moment. In Sr2MnIrO6, the observed small paramagnetic moment at the Ir-site indicates that hybridization between the t2g electrons of the Mn 4+ (3d 3 ) configuration and the Ir 5d shell is supressed. Unfortunately, we could not perform XMCD measurements as a function of the Sr2MnIrO6 strain state as the thin-film samples on DyScO3 substrates were detached from the sample holders on application of strong magnetic fields due to high paramagnetic moment of Dy. Moreover, in the case of (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2TaAlO6)0.7 substrates, XANES spectra at the Ir L2,3-edges were masked by signal from nearby Ta-edge.</p><p>[1] A. Kolchinskaya et al Phys. Rev.

Recent theory and experiments reveal Ir 4+ (5d 5 ) to exhibit effective total angular momentum J = ½ due to large SOC[2,3]. Even a small Coulomb repulsion U may open a Mott gapped state in Iridates, which results in J = ½ due to the spin-orbital Mott state.</figDesc></figure>
