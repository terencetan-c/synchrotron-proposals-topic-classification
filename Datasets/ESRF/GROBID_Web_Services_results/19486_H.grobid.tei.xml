<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the course of the long term proposal MI 490 we have carried out until now two sessions on ID13, one from 28 June 2001 to 02 July 2001 and the second from 01 July 2002 to 07 July 2002. These two sessions have been mainly used for microdiffraction studies to analyse the interface between a Zr prosthetic device implanted in a rat femur and the newly-formed bone, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 micron.</p><p>The experiments exploit the innovative X-ray microdiffraction technique based on the X-ray waveguide developed by our group.</p><p>In particular the first session, 28 June 2001 to 02 July 2001, which had mainly methodological objectives, has been used to show <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> the advantages, as compared to traditional X-ray diffraction, of using this innovative technique to study the interface between newly formed bone and a Zr prostheses with 0.5 micron spatial resolution.</p><p>The sample has been accurately scanned through the micro-beam and diffraction patterns have been acquired by the CCD. The careful analysis of the patterns allowed to extract the concentration profile of the different crystalline elements coexisting in the interface region with a spatial resolution of 0.5 µ . From the analysis of the XRD pattern acquired at the interface region, the Zr ring broadening can be investigated, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the [101] and [112] reflections. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> gives an indication of the structural variation of the Zr and suggests that in the interface region an important lattice deformation is present. The measured diffraction spectrum of the reconstructed bone at the interface region, has been compared with the spectra of the trabecular and the cortical bone. A first qualitative comparison reveals that the pattern of the trabecular bone is characterised by the diffused diffraction rings indicating an important amorphous contribution likely coming from the collagen lattice.</p><p>Careful analysis of the spectra (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) reveals a marked difference between the new-formed and the native bone. The spectrum of the latter is perfectly compatible with the hexagonal system of the HA, as well known in literature while the spectrum of the new bone appears to be quite different. From a detailed analysis it comes out that this experimental spectrum is compatible with the octocalcium phosphate (OCP) which can be a precursor in the bone mineralization. Indeed in the first step of bone formation the presence of the OCP phase should be substantial.</p><p>The power of this micro-diffraction technique can be clearly seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> where the intensity variation of  A detailed analysis of the ring profiles suggests that the grain size of the OCP is comparable with the beam size and larger then the grains of HA.</p><p>About the first session we can certainly conclude that these structural information can not be deduced by electron microscopy. In particular EDS measurements can only monitor Ca concentration, independently from its crystallographic phase. This limitation does not really allow to distinguish the newly formed bone from the native one.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
