<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the current proposal was to explore the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the charge density wave (CDW) instability and on its competition to superconductivity (SC) in the underdoped cuprates. Despite the intensive research activity on the subject over the last 3 years, this remains an open question due to the technical difficulties imposed by the use of high pressure equipment and the weak signatures of the CDW modulations.</p><p>Following our experience from previous energy integrated experiments (see [1]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>), we addressed this question using inelastic x-ray scattering to measure the underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.6 superconductor in a diamond anvil cell. The energy-resolved nature of the technique allowed us to filter out the continuous background signal from the diamond anvils and to follow the quasi elastic central peak intensity as well as the phonon anomalies associated with the CDW formation.</p><p>The experiments were performed on high quality detwinned YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.6 (p=0.12, T c = 61 K) single crystals, from the same bunch as the ones measured in our ambient pressure study <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>. The samples were polished prior to the experiment to plates with dimensions of 80*80 µm and thicknesses of 30 µm. We followed the pressure and temperature dependence of the transverse acoustic and optical phonons along the (010) direction. The number of the accessible Brillouin zones was limited by the geometrical restrictions imposed by the opening of the diamond anvil cell. For every pressure we collected a reference spectrum at high temperature and then we cooled the cell below the CDW and the superconducting transition temperatures. Major complications and experimental time delays arose from the sample rotations/tilts inside the diamond anvil cell during the pressure and temperature changes.</p><p>We collected high quality inelastic spectra from -5 to 20 meV, like the ones shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for P=3 kbar at T=298 K and 65 K. Already from the raw data of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> it is clear that at 65 K, unlike room temperature, there is a pronounced broadening of the acoustic phonon around the CDW ordering wavevector q CDW =(0 0.31 0.5). The experimental data were fitted to damped harmonic oscillators lineshapes convoluted with the experimental resolution and the fit results for the phonon energy and linewidth at 65 K and 3 kbar is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Already at a hydrostatic pressure of 3 kbar the effect appears to be much suppressed, approximately to half, with respect to ambient pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>.</p><p>While the analysis of the large number of data collected from the 9 different analysers/detectors is still ongoing, we can already report some preliminary conclusions. In our hydrostatic pressure experiment we could identify phonon anomalies in the CDW and SC state around the ordering wavevector q CDW , similar to the ones observed at ambient pressure. Our data clearly show that the amplitude of these anomalies is supressed under pressure. While this is not very surprising given the previously reported competition between the CDW and SC states and the pressure-induced increase of T c (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>), our data however point out that it is a very rapid suppression and indicate a very delicate dependence of the CDW associated anomalies to the local structural details. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a,b) Momentum dependence of the IXS spectra along the (010) direction at room temperature (a) and 65 K (b).
