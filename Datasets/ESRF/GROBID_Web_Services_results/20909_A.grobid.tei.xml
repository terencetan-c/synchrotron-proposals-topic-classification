<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The crystallographic structure determines the shape and properties of crystals. Current theories that predict the growth shape of a crystal are based on the bulk crystallographic structure 1 . These theories ignore the role of deviations from the bulk structure at the growth interface. From the surface science point of view this assumption appears to be somewhat crude, but it is a good starting point that has been proven to be quite successful. By using the present generation of synchrotron radiation sources, surface X-ray diffraction is now starting to provide quantitative information about surface termination, relaxation and the role that impurities play.</p><p>Here, we rapport the surface structure of the NaCl(100). Sodium chloride crystallizes quite easily and is one of the most produced alkali halides. In these ionic crystals with their delicate balance between electrostatic forces and Van der Waals interactions, small changes in the surface structure may significantly influence the interaction potential. Thus, the detailed knowledge of the surface structure is needed.</p><p>NaCl crystals were mounted in a growth chamber 2 and data were collected for two different environmental conditions: air and 85% humidity. Data collection was quite difficult because the xrays were found to generate significant amount of bulk defects in NaCl, so-called F and H-centers 3 .</p><p>The surface structure is not directly affected, but the bulk defects give a rise to huge background signal, making it difficult to measure the surface signal (figure 1.)</p><p>We, nevertheless, were able to measure in total 167 non-equivalent reflections in air, consisting of the ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) rod and specular reflectivity data, with an agreement factor of 16% when averaged over all measurement conditions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the measured structure factor amplitudes of the (20) rod. For the 85% humidity conditions we collected in total 110 nonequivalent reflections with agreement factor of 15% consisting of the same rods.</p><p>Our data show that the surface layer of NaCl ( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) is terminated with a top layer containing alternating Na + and Cl -ions for the both experimental conditions, as expected. A good description of the data, however, is only obtained when small out-of-plane ion relaxations in the top layer are allowed and when a simple model for surface roughness on an atomic scale is included. In air, according to our analysis, Na + is relaxed outward 0.10Å (towards to bulk) and Cl -is relaxed 0.04 Å inward (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). For the measurements in the 85% humid environment relaxations are somewhat bigger. These analyses are still in progress.  References: 1 P.Hartman and W. G. Perdok, Acta Cryst. 8, 49 (1955). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 (0,0,1.7) surface reflection with a broad background due to a bulk defects.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,24.28,397.68,178.20,106.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
