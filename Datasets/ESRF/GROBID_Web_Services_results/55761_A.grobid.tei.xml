<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) are ubiquitous family of ATP-independent chaperones. They bind partially denatured proteins, thereby preventing irreversible protein aggregation during stress. A typical sHSP monomer consists of a distinct conserved β-sandwich domain named the α-crystallin domain (ACD), forming dimers, whereby the termini are flexible, vary in length and lack sequence conservation across different species. The variable amino-and carboxy-terminal extensions are thought to direct the formation of larger sHSP oligomers, however, the exact mechanism, determinants of oligomerization and even exact oligomer state are still elusive. Recently, using a hybrid approach for structural and functional investigation of human HSPB6, we obtained insights into structure and dynamics of this dimeric protein by combining partial crystallographic structures and SAXS data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Phosphorylated HSPB6 have a specific site for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins -well-known universal adaptors participating in multiple vital cellular processes due to their ability to recognize phosphorylated partner proteins. The main aim of this project was to provide a comprehensive structural picture of 14-3-3/HSPB6 complex and its constituents in solution using available partial crystal structures and SAXS data. Moreover, as a pilot experiment we performed SAXS measurements using few chimeric HSPs to understand better mechanism and determinants of oligomerization.</p><p>During the ESRF visit, we performed SAXS measurements of a C-terminal deletion mutant of HSPB6, a deletion mutant of 14-3-3, their complex as well as complexes with two other mutants of HSPB6, where 10 residues were removed from N-terminal region (HSPB6.Δ21-30 and HSPB6.Δ31-40). In 2013 we performed SAXS measurements at P12 (DESY, Hamburg) in batch mode on full-length complex, however, we could not exclude the possibility of partial complex dissociation. Hence, we also conducted SAXS measurements using an in-line HPLC system (Shodex KW404-4F column). To analyze the HPLC-SAXS results, we developed a tool for a rapid data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which provides estimations of forward scattering, I(0), radius of gyration, R g , maximum particle size, D max , molecular weight, MW, from Porod volume and volume of correlation of the studied sample as well as outputs a figure reflecting calculated parameters (fig. <ref type="figure">1  a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1 (a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>) datasw output for a 14-3-3 protein complex containing a high molecular weight oligomer (peak 1) alongside with the main species (peak 2). (c) SAXS profiles for peak 1 (red line) and peak 2 (blue line).</p><p>Subtracted scattering curve for deletion mutant of apo 14-3-3 was extrapolated and further analyzed. There are a number of structures mainly in the peptide-bound closed form but also some in the open form available from PDB. Validation of the scattering data suggested that in solution apo 14-3-3 is present in an open form. Our previous data on 14-3-3 bound to a peptide suggested a closed conformation consistent with the published results <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>We then compared the extrapolated scattering curve obtained from the concentration series of 14-3-3/HSPB6 complex recorded in the batch mode with the peak#2 average from HPLC-SAXS, showing an excellent agreement, despite an additional peak (#1) seen in HPLC profile (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This additional peak, representing high MW oligomers, could have resulted from a rather high loaded concentration in HPLC mode (~12.5 mg/ml) or unspecific interaction of the sample with the column.</p><p>The extrapolated data was further analyzed and used for model validation. MW estimation confirmed expected 2:2 stoichiometry of the complex. The available partial structure of HSPB6 represents ACD, whereas most of the ~70 residues N-terminal are presumably dynamic. We used the program CORAL to build the missing residues while dimeric ACD and 14-3-3 were treated as rigid bodies with the former allowed to move freely. The resulting models ('Rigid body model') could not reconstitute the scattering data very well (table 1, fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref>) and there was no convergence observed with HSPB6 being positioned in different orientations with respect to 14-3-3 in 20 different CORAL reconstructions. Kratky plot suggested a rather compact arrangement of all complexes (data not shown), however no interaction interface was determined for both proteins, implying that the N-terminal part of HPSB6, bearing sequence identical to peptides binding 14-3-3, could be harnessed by 14-3-3 protein, allowing for multiple conformations present simultaneously in solution. Hence we performed ensemble analysis using ensemble optimization method (EOM). EOM is limited to single chain proteins only. To overcome this limitation and given the proximity of the C-terminus of 14-3-3 to the N-terminus of HPSB6, the sequences were united, whereas the sequence in their symmetry mates was inversed to mimic a single chain. Using available partial structures and a pseudo-sequence, program RANCH was used to generate 10,000 models for each possible scenario (dihedral angle distributions) of modeling missing parts: compact chain (CC), native-like (NL) and random coil (RC). The position of 14-3-3 was fixed together with peptides in the peptide binding sites of 14-3-3 and only symmetric part of HPSB6dimeric alpha-crystallin domain (ACD)was allowed to move, while missing N-terminal linkers were modeled. Thereafter a genetic algorithm, GAJOE, was used to select an ensemble model based on the available SAXS data. Each individual RANCH model was also fitted to the scattering data. GAJOE was run 10 times to ensure reproducibility and convergence of the obtained results. Ensemble modeling resulted in a converging solution in terms of distribution of Radius of gyration (R g ) and a more narrow range of discrepancy (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>, <ref type="figure">table 1</ref>). Interestingly, the lowest discrepancy was observed for CC scenario (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), suggesting also that the selected ensemble should have a very compact preferred arrangement (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>), whereby HSPB6 would have multiple orientations with respect to the cleft-side of the 14-3-3. This result is in-line with our previous observations, that N-terminus of HSPB6 is flexible but within a rather confined area <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The discrepancy could further be improved using an all-atom ensemble modeling pipeline (FULCHER) developed in our group (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The subsequent refinement using normal modes of top scoring 5,000 all-atom models, according to MolProbity clash score, did not improve significantly discrepancy. This, however, indicated that reasonable fitting of scattering data can be achieved even with top scoring stereochemically sound models present in the random pool.</p><p>The scattering data for the other two complexes was analyzed in a similar manner, although EOM analysis was not possible due to presence of flexible C-terminus in HSPB6 constuct, making it impossible to unite sequences in a single pseudochain. For both constructs, generated CORAL models showed different position and orientation of HSPB6 with respect to 14-3-3 with Chi^2 ranging from 4.62 to 8.64 and 2.16 to 4.73 for 14-3-3/HSPB6.d21-30 and 14-3-3/HSPB6.d31-40, respectively.</p><p>As a pilot project we measured chimeras with C-terminal domain swap of HSPB6 (named '665') and N-terminal domain swap of HSPB5 ('655') as well as wild type proteins, present in solution as a dimer (HSPB6) and a ~24-mer (HSPB5). We expected that both constructs would behave like dimeric HSPB6.WT, as we believe that N-terminal region of HSPB6 could govern the oligomerization or more precisely its absence (ACD dimer in solution is present as a dimer). However, the analysis of HPLC-SAXS data for both constructs revealed fibrillation-like behaviour (fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which is neither observed for HSPB6 nor for HSPB5. Fibrils seem to have a similar cross section (analysis is in progress) and grow with the increasing concentration as judged from increase of D max with increasing concentration for data recorded in the batch mode. Currently, we are preparing several other constructs, among which the most important ones have a Cterminal domain swap of HSPB5 (556) and ACD domain swaps (656 and 565). This will allow us to pinpoint the main determinants of oligomerization and understand if the domain/region crosstalk is required for correct oligomerization behaviour.</p><p>Figure3: HPLC-SAXS analysis of 665 (A, B) and 655 (C, D).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: (A).
