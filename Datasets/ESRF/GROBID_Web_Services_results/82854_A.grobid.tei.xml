<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Summary</head><p>Polarimetry has been increasingly recognized as an important observational parameter for high energy astrophysics. However, polarimetry in high-energy astrophysics has been insufficiently explored due to the complexity of the required detector systems: detection, electronic and signal processing systems. Herein we study a new prototype in two layers Compton configuration based on two CdTe spectro-imagers operated in coincidence within 100 keV up to 600 keV energy range. The two CdTe detectors have an anode segmented in 8 x 8 pixels (2 mm pitch) on 2 mm thick crystals. The new detection system configuration allows to assess the scattering polarimetric performance of a 3D spectro-imager by changing the distance between the two CdTe pixel detection layers. The prototype measured performances provide useful data to optimize a spectro-imager with polarimetric capabilities for both high efficiency Laue lens telescope focal plane and all sky advanced Compton telescope design for next generation space missions.</p><p>This document reports on the experiment MI-1275 done at the beamline ID15A in the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) between 26 September and 2 October of 2017. The device available at ID15A was the U22 undulator, which delivers sufficient flux energies up to 300 keV with a polarization level of ~99 %. For all the tests performed we set the energy to 278 keV.</p><p>The prototype detectors were firstly evaluated individually and proved to have a good performance for polarimetric measurements. Regarding the 2 layers Compton configuration: we evaluate the modulation factor Q and its dependence with the distance between detectors; and its potential to determine the polarization angle orientation by performing measurements at different polarization direction angles. The results showed that the modulation factor Q decreases for higher distances between detectors. The reason for this result is the lower scattering angles accepted for higher distances that affect the modulation factor Q. Regarding the potential to determine the polarization angle orientation the polarization angular resolution obtained was better that 8Â°.</p><p>In order to validate our simulation and prototype design for a high-energy space telescope, the prototype must be tested and its performance analyzed in a wider energy band, 100 keV up to 600 keV. During the time slots provided to this experiment, it was not possible because the beamline ID15A had flux limitations for higher energies. The level of polarization is another parameter that we want to evaluate to determine the sensitivity of this configuration to it. The system is also being improved to allow a fine tuning of distance between the two layers and the acceptance of higher scattering angles.</p></div>

Over the last decade, the diversity and richness of the gamma-rays sky have been revealed through the joint exploitation of instruments on-board satellites such as INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope in the soft and high energy gamma-ray domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Position, spectral and temporal analyses have now been made possible, and hence, confronted to multi-wavelength data to probe the underlying physical mechanisms of the observed sources, among them: gamma-ray bursts, novae, supernovae and their remnants, pulsars and their wind nebulae, accreting binary systems and active galactic nuclei, massive stars and stellar formation regions.</p><p>Polarization of high energy sources is one of the key observational parameter to understand the emission mechanisms and geometry of a wide number of cosmic objects such as gamma-ray bursts, pulsars and others, where some degree of polarization is expected [3]- <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Even though this has been known for quite some time in the scientific community, no dedicated gamma-ray polarimeter have been launched into space. In the soft gamma-ray domain only a few polarimetric measurements were possible by the SPI (Spectrometer On INTEGRAL) and IBIS (Imager on Board the INTEGRAL Satellite) instruments on-board the INTEGRAL mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, on the Crab Pulsar, on the galactic black-hole Cygnus X-1, and on several gamma ray bursts (GRBs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>CdTe based polarimeters for future high energy mission are being studied by our groups for more than a decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. A series of experiments were performed at the ESRF under a ~99% polarized gamma-rays beam (MI-592/854/905/966/1074). These experiments have allowed us to assess the use of such devices to perform high sensitivity polarimetric measurements together with spectroscopy, imaging and timing in the 0.1-1 MeV energy range. The polarimetric performance was analyzed for different detector pixel sizes and thicknesses, for Laue lens focalized beams as well as for different off-axis beam inclinations, energy ranges, beam polarization angles and polarization levels. The objective is to implement this kind of detectors in a new generation of high-energy telescope mission concepts based on highly segmented multi-layer instruments and broad band Laue focusing techniques, that can achieve a sensitivity up 100 times better than current instruments. The results obtained have already motivated several partnership proposals submitted in the ESA (European Space Agency): GRI (Gamma-Ray Imager) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, DUAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, ASTROGAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and e-ASTROGRAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>This experiment aims to bring this study to another level, closer to realistic focal plane configurations and operation modes, by developing and testing a new detector prototype configuration consisting in a 2 layer Compton spectro-imager based on 2 CdTe pixelized sensors, operated as a Compton scattering polarimeter. This new prototype configuration allows to study and to assess not only the multi-layer focal plane solution but also the scattering polarimetric performances of a 3D spectro-imager by varying the distance between the two CdTe pixel detection layers over the 100-700 keV energy range. These results will be of fundamental importance for both high efficiency Laue lens telescope focal planes and allsky advanced Compton telescope designs for the next generation of space missions. Both solutions require the implementation of highly segmented multi-layer or 3D detection systems with high efficiency and fine trajectory resolution to fulfil the sensitivity requirements of such future space telescope missions.</p><p>In particular, the current prototype results and conclusions will contribute to validate and boost the development of innovative concepts to address high-energy astrophysics most relevant issues within e-ASTROGAM and ASTENA (Advanced Surveyor of Transient Events and Nuclear Astrophysics) mission proposals in the framework of Work Package 9 activities of H2020 AHEAD (Integrated Activities in the High Energy Astrophysics Domain) project <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.

Furthermore, we will participate in development of ASTENA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> first gamma-ray Laue lens telescope.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Compton Scattering Polarimetry</head><p>The polarimetric performance of a high-energy detection plane is determined by the fundamental concepts associated with polarized Compton interactions and by its design. A polarized photon beam that is scattered by a detector element generates Compton scattered photons whose azimuthal distribution is not uniform. Indeed, the scattered photons' angular direction depends on its initial polarization angle. If the scattered photon goes through a new interaction inside the detector, the statistical distribution of photons angular directions defined by the two interactions (double-event) provides a modulation curve from which the degree and polarization direction of the incident beam can be derived. The azimuthal angular distribution of the scattered photons is given by the Klein-Nishina differential cross-section for linearly polarized photons:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ðð</formula><p>01,3 ðÎ© = ð 7 8 2 9 ð¸â² ð¸ &lt; 8 = ð¸â² ð¸ + ð¸ ð¸â² -2ð ðð 8 ðððð  8 ðG Eq. 3.1</p><p>where ð 7 is the classical electron radius, ð¸ and ð¸' are, respectively, the energies of the incoming and outgoing photons, q the angle of the scattered photons and f is the angle between the scattering plane (defined by the incoming and outgoing photon directions) and incident polarization plane (defined by the polarization direction and the direction of the incoming photon). As can be seen from Eq. 3.1, after fixing all other parameters the scattering probability varies with the azimuthal angle j and its maximum and minimum arises for orthogonal directions. For ð = 0Â° the cross-section reaches a minimum and for ð = 90Â° the cross-section reaches a maximum. The polarimetric performance of an instrument can be evaluated by calculating the polarimetric modulation factor, ð J77 , of double-event distribution generated by a 100% polarized beam, and is defined as the amplitude of the modulation curve:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ð J77 = ð // -ð N// + ð ^ Eq. 3.2</formula><p>where ð // and ð ^, are the double-events integrated over two orthogonal directions defined over the detector plane along the maxima and minima of the modulation curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A higher value of Q means that the instrument responds to polarized radiation with a larger modulation and the effect of statistical fluctuations is, in proportion, lower. For a bi-planar polarimeter as the one schematized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the photons are scattered in the top detector, depositing part of their energy there, and then, are absorbed by the bottom detection. The scattering direction is defined by the hit pixels in the two detectors. In order to calculate the modulation factor, the events are selected in a hollow cone defined by ð TUV and ð TWX (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). An estimate of the modulation factor as function of ð TUV and ð TWX can be computed taking into account the geometry of the instrument and the angular dependence of the differential cross section of Compton scattering. Using equation Eq. 3.2 the modulation factor is given by: ð(ð, ð TUV , ð TWX ) = ð(ð, ð = 90Â° , ð TUV , ð TWX ) -ð(ð, ð = 0Â° , ð TUV , ð TWX ) ð(ð, ð = 90Â° , ð TUV , ð TWX ) + ð(ð, ð = 0Â° , ð TUV , ð TWX ) Eq. 3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">3</formula><p>where Îµ is the energy of the incident photon in units of electron rest energy, ð = ð¸ â (ð _ ð 8 ) and ð(ð, ð, ð TUV , ð TWX ) is the modulation curve integrated over the range of ð values and can be derived using Eq. 3.1 and knowing the ratio between the photon energy before and after the scattering given by the Compton physics ð¸' = ð¸ â (1 + ð (1 -ððð ð)) :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ð(ð, ð, ð TUV , ð TWX ) = `9 1 1 + ð(1 -ððð  (ð) + 1 [1 + ð(1 -ððð (ð)] c - 2ð ðð 8 ð ððð  8 ð [1 + ð(1 -ððð (ð)] 8 &lt; ð ððð ðð d efg d ehi</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eq. 3.4</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we report the modulation factor as a function of ð TUV and ð TWX for 300 keV photons. As can be seen the value of the modulation factor increases monotonically with ð TUV and ð TWX and the higher value obtained is when ð TUV and ð TWX have values ~90Â°. This is the case of a thin single plane detector. For our prototype, the values of ð TUV and ð TWX depends on the size of the detectors and the distance between them. The latest parameter can be adjusted therefore we evaluated the modulation factor for different values of ð TUV and ð TWX , however ð TUV is limited due to the low energy threshold of the top detector. </p></div>

Nevertheless, we summarize each subsystem here highlighting the changes from the previous experiments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Detection System</head><p>The detectors available for this work are two 8 Â´ 8 pixels CdTe sensors fabricated by ACRORAD. The dimensions of each pixel are 1.9 Â´ 1.9 mm with an inter-pixel gap of 0.1 mm. The detector has a solid electrode (cathode) on one side and 64 pixels (anodes) on the other side (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>   Each detector was soldered in an individual PCB. The connection between the PBCs is made through a 64 pin flat cable to allow the movement between the two planes. The bottom detector PCB makes the interface to the Front-end Electronics through 2 high density connectors of 100 pins each. Both PCBs are enclosed in one light tight and electrically shielded container. To change the distance between planes we use hexagonal aluminum spacers, which are available in many different sizes. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> is shown the CAD drawing POLCA IV system with the Frond-end Electronics enclosure (red box) and the detectors enclosure (transparent) with the two detectors inside. It also shows a picture of the two PCBs that support the detectors.</p><p>The Front-end Electronics used in POLCA IV is the same as the previous experiments and comprises 8 ASICs (eV Products) with 16 independent channels each, resulting in a total of 128 channels allowing the readout of the two 64 pixels detectors. These devices sensitivity varies in function of the energy band selectable gain: 1.2 up to 7.2 mV/keV, with peaking-time adjustable between 0.6 and 4 Î¼s. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Read-out Electronics TAKES</head><p>The signals were processed by a custom multiparametric system consisting of 128 independent channels with filters, coincidence logic and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) units. When operating in coincidence mode, all signals exceeding the lower energy threshold occurring in the same coincidence time window (2 Î¼s) are analyzed as generated by the same event. The typical irradiated pixel count rate was about 10 4 counts/s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Data Acquisition System</head><p>This unit was based on a commercial data acquisition card PXI DAQ-6533 provided by National Instruments connected to a personal computer and controlled by a LabView application. For each event we obtained information about the number of hits, the triggered pixels and the energy deposited in each hit. The software is based in LabView and is designed for acquisition control and data analysis. The main window is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The software was mostly based on the software of the previous experiments being the main difference the addition of two pixel maps corresponding to each detector. For each TAKES channel there is a correspondence to the number of the pixel and detector. Experiment No MI-1275 Report 10/ 26 5 Experiment Preparation at LIP-Coimbra</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">ASIC operative Setting</head><p>The ASICs used in the experiment have been used and characterized in past experiences. Each ASIC have both peaking-time and gain settable by two set of micro-switches on the ASIC board. We have to choose the operative values that are most suitable for the operation energy range that we are using at the ESRF. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> it was obtained the relation between the ASIC output voltage and the energy, and is given by: ð(volt) â ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>  We want to use the system up to 700 keV so based on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> we set the gain to 100 mV/fC and a peaking-time of 1.2 Âµs. The total operation range of the system can be further adjusted using the trimmers that are available on each analog signal on the TAKES boards. To prevent the saturation of the signal in the TAKES board we interface the ASICs and the TAKES board with 12 kÎ© resistors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Detector Status before the ESRF test campaign.</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref> is shown the false color maps for both detectors obtained at LIP-Coimbra laboratory before the ESRF test campaign. This measurement was made by scanning both detectors with a uncollimated source of 133 Ba. Each pixel had an individual measurement with the same time and the single events of the pixel in study were then selected. To obtain the final false color that is shown we sum all the individual pixel measurements.</p><p>As can be seen the top detector is quite uniform, despite the 16 dead pixels. The bottom detector was almost unusable due to the dead pixels and the poor uniformity performance. The reason for the dead pixels is the bonding technique used to attach the detector to the support PCB. During the laboratory experiments we realize that the solders broke very easily. Fortunately, we had the opportunity to change to bottom detector during the ESRF campaign for a better and stable one. The top detector was the same for all the tests, but as will be shown in the chapter 7.1 the detector lost more pixels during all the transport and setup of the experiment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Multiparametric Electronics chain equalization</head><p>All the top detector pixel channels have been equalized at LIP-Coimbra, using an uncollimated 133 Ba source. The source was placed few cm above the detector cathode. To equalize the gain of each channel we used the trimmers available on each analog channel of the TAKES boards that allow a fine gain adjustment from 0.5 to 1.5 relative to the main amplifier gain.</p><p>Using as reference line the 356 keV photopeak, we have equalized the peak channels to have the centroid on channel ~540 using the acquisition s/w tool. During the ESRF test this detector was replaced by a new one. A summary of these results is given in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> that shows the full-energy peak centroid for each pixel. The data analysis demonstrated that detector is quite uniform, with a relative standard deviation ~ 0.1%.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Detector System Calibration</head><p>As second step, the detector was calibrated using radioactive sources with different gamma-rays energies in order to study the spectroscopic response and to obtain the calibration line (channel vs energy) to verify the response linearity of each pixel. During these phase, we used two uncollimated radioactive sources (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>) positioned a few centimeters above the detector: 57 Co (122 keV) and 133 Ba (81 keV and 356 keV). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref> are plotted the parameters of the calibration straight line for each pixel.</p><p>In the TAKES read-out electronics, we can set the minimum energy threshold of the system. This threshold is set to prevent the low voltage electronic noise, but should be low enough to read the low energy deposited in the detector by photons in the first interaction of the Compton event. The average low energy threshold of the detection system is ~40 keV. Figure 12 -The calibration parameters by a straight line fitting of the peak channel vs energy relation for each active pixel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">ESRF ID15 A Beamline</head><p>ID15A is dedicated to applications of high energy X-rays radiation to materials chemistry and engineering. It contains two in-line experimental hutches for high-energy X-rays experiments. The first, EH2, is for materials engineering experiments, and the second, EH3, is for materials chemistry experiments. The hutch used was the EH2 which is show on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>. ID15A has two insertion devices. One is a compact wiggler source W76, which provides a continuous spectrum up to several hundred keV gamma-rays and the second is a U22 undulator, which provides brilliant X-rays in the 30-140 keV energy range. For this experiment, the device available was the U22 undulator which delivers sufficient flux for energies up to 300 keV. For all the measurements we selected an energy of 278 keV. The detector container was mounted perpendicular to the photons beam inside a rotational stage on a XYZ positioning system as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">15</ref>. All the detector subsystems (detector, power supply, multiparametric electronics) have been mounted inside the experimental hutch, leaving in the control room only the serial to parallel interface box and the computer with the NI6533 data acquisition board and the Quick-look software. Between the beam from the monochromator bench and the detector window is placed a tungsten collimator with a variable square aperture and an absorber with a triangular shape. Through the ESRF control console is possible to manage all the positioning and rotation stage, the optics hutch shutter and the absorber positioning. The experiment was divided on the following steps: 1. Pixel scan of the top detector. 2. The size of the beam was changed and aligned with the center of one of the pixels of the top plane. 3. Bottom detector was placed at 6 mm from the top one and a new pixel scan was performed with both detectors placed. 4. We choose 4 pixels to irradiate in order to evaluate to polarimetric performance of the dual polarimeter for two distances: 6 mm and 10 mm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>The beam was place on the center and the detector was rotated 0Â°, 20Â° and 45Â° for 6 mm distance. 6. The detector was tilted 4Â°. 7. During the firsts two steps another detector was used on the bottom plane. This detector had a lot of dead pixels and a poor performance, so we changed it for the subsequent tests. Nevertheless, the data acquired during these tests was used to perform the polarimetric evaluation of the top detector, since there is no interference of the bottom detector on these tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">ESRF Data Analysis</head><p>The recorded data was analyzed off-line by a MatlabÂ® software custom tool which allows the selection of single, double and multiple events (photons undergoing at least three interactions in the detection plane). These selections of events were then used for different analysis: pixel response uniformity and polarimetric analysis, both intra layer (double events on the same detector plane) and dual layer (double events in between the two detector planes). On each analysis is presented a more detailed description of the methods used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Pixel Response Uniformity</head><p>The pixel scan allowed us to characterize the CdTe detectors. We evaluated the distribution of the gain (the full-energy peak channel), energy resolution, and relative efficiency, across each array.</p><p>The pixel scan over all the pixels was performed using the ESRF beam at 278 keV. Both detectors were tested at the same time. In order to compensate any misalignment in between the two detectors each pixel was divided in 16 subpixels that were scanned with a 0.5 Ã 0.5 mm 8 beam for 10 s, resulting in a total of 1024 steps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">16</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.1">Detectors evaluation</head><p>Since there are dead pixels on both detectors, the pixel scan allowed to find the dead pixels and the better detector zones for the polarimetric measurements. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> is shown the pixel maps for both detectors achieved with the pixel scans. We found that a total of 49 dead pixels: 17 on the bottom detector and 32 on the top detector. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.2">Spectroscopic performance</head><p>To evaluate the spectroscopic performance parameters we have used only the single events (i.e. events from a hit with one pixel) by fitting the corresponding full-energy peak in the spectra. A summary of these results is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref> that shows the full-energy peak centroid and the energy resolution (FWHM) calculated for each pixel of each detector.  The data analysis demonstrated that the top detector is quite uniform, with a standard deviation ~ 1.8%, while the bottom detector exhibits a gain dispersion up to 25%. The reason for this is that the top detector was previous equalized in the laboratory before ESRF campaign, but the bottom was only tested during the campaign and there was no opportunity to equalize it. This information will be useful to select the Compton events by their energy in the polarimetric analysis.</p><p>The results of the spectroscopic performances show that the bottom has a slightly better energy resolution with an average value ~ 7.5% while the top detector shows an average value ~ 9.4%. The relative standard deviation is around 21% for both detectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.3">Event efficiency</head><p>The second step was the analysis of the efficiency uniformity with respect to the single events and double events, i.e. Compton scattered events that trigger two separate pixels inside the coincidence window. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">21</ref> summarizes the evaluation of the pixel relative efficiency for single and double events in the two CdTe arrays, while Table <ref type="table">1</ref> reports the average values. The relative efficiency is defined as the ratio between the number of detected single or double events in the beam incidence pixel and the total detected events in the array during the same measurement.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.1">Data Selection and Corrections</head><p>There are several effects that under certain conditions might introduce significant errors in the modulation factor Q measurement. However, for CdTe pixelized matrices the dominant source of error is the non-uniformity in pixel response due to material imperfections throughout the matrix crystal. It may vary by more than 25% for a significant fraction of the pixels. Another important source of systematic errors is related to our experiment, in particular the alignment accuracy of the beam with respect to the irradiated pixel center and the alignment between detectors. In order to minimize these sources of error before each measurement we performed a complete scan of all detector pixels. The scan was performed with ESRF polarized beam at 278 keV for both detectors at the same time and at the laboratory with an uncollimated source. The matrix data of each detector obtained from the single events recorded in each pixel was then used to correct the inherent non-uniformities in the response of the detector pixels. We estimate the true double event counts for each pixel by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ð â¦ â  â¡_ = ð Ëâ°Å  ð Vâ°V ð TWX Eq. 7.1</formula><p>where ð Ëâ°Å  is the number of double events detected (that depend on the beam polarization level), ð Vâ°V is the number of single events of the response map obtained when the pixel is directly irradiated and ð TWX is the maximum value among all the matrix pixels single events. By applying this method to the pixels surrounding the irradiated pixel, the error introduced by the non-uniformity of the detector matrix response is minimized thereby improving the accuracy of the calculated modulation factor Q .</p><p>To evaluate the polarimetric performance we selected the double events in each measurement. We separate them in intra layer interactions (double events in the same plane) and dual layer interactions (double events in the two detectors). Multiple events do not enter into our calculations since we cannot determine the order of each hit. For double events, we know which is the first interaction because this is coincident with the position of the pixel irradiated by the collimated beam and therefore during the analysis we exclude double events that do not have at least one interaction in the target pixel, e.g. chance coincidence events due to noise and flaring pixels and/or triple events in which the first interaction in the target pixel was under the low energy threshold. Because of the impinging beam was monochromatic we also applied a further simple selection of double events using the energy deposited in each hit. Knowing the beam energy, we have selected as good double events only those in which the sum of the two interactions is within a window centered at the selected beam energy. Furthermore, taking into account the Compton kinematics and the detector geometry we also evaluate the energy of each hit. Since the impinging beam has an energy of 278 keV for the intra layer interaction the Compton scattering angle is around ~90Â° we expect that the first hit has an energy ~100 keV and the second ~180 keV. For the double layer interactions, the energy of the events depends on the scattering angles we are looking for, so we select an energy range accordingly. Lastly, due to the low energy threshold of the system, ~40 keV, we expected that the minimum scattering angle is ~25Â°, so we exclude double events with scattering angles below this threshold.</p><p>In order to optimize the double-event histogram readout, we applied the radial bin technique (RBT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, by dividing the matrix into 24 radial bins of 15Â° each. Pixels partially crossed by angular bin lines contribute only with a fraction of the number of events equal to the fraction of its area that is in the sector -this is an approximation since real hits inside each pixel are not uniformly distributed but have a radial dependence relative to the position of the first Compton interaction of a double-event. The modulation curve, ð(ð), giving the number of double-events as a function of the azimuthal angle j, was then obtained. The polarimetric modulation factor Q was calculated from Eq. 3.2 and the polarization direction was obtained from the angle that maximizes the modulation curve.</p><p>The described data correction and analysis techniques were implemented in a MatLab based code that processed the prototype output data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.2">Intra layer polarimetric performance</head><p>The detectors used have never been tested for polarimetric measurements, only for spectral measurements in the laboratory. These tests have the aim to evaluate the polarimetric performance of each of the detector planes. In particular the result of these test type is the determination of the modulation factor Q of both detectors.</p><p>The first evaluation was the top detector. During this evaluation, we also made beam size tests with the top detector. We irradiate the top detector on pixel #14 and made three measurements with three different beam sizes: 0.1 Ã 0.1 mm 8 , 0.5 Ã 0.5 mm 8 and 1.9 Ã 1.9 mm 8 . The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">22</ref>. The results show a decrease of the modulation factor Q with the increase of the beam size. These results are in accordance with the values obtained in previous experiments for CdTe detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The modulation factor Q was then evaluated for the bottom detector. In this case the detector was irradiated in pixel #62, where we were able to obtain double distributions throughout the crystal volume until second order pixels. We also rotated the detector to evaluate its potential to determine the polarization angle orientation. For these measurements the beam size was 1.0 Â´ 1.0 mm 2 .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">23</ref> shows false color maps resulting from double event distributions generated by a 278 keV monochromatic beam with polarization angles at 0Â° and 20Â°. As can be seen the double events are not uniformly distributed around the irradiated pixel for a polarization angle of 0Â°. As expected from theory, a maximum number of Compton photons were detected in the pixels along the direction defined by top-center-bottom of the matrix. Inside the experimental hutch it corresponds to the vertical direction. This matches with the fact that the beam polarization is horizontal inside the hutch since the polarization is always perpendicular to the maximum intensity direction. When the detector matrix is rotated by 20Â° the projection of the polarization in the detector plane is also rotated by the same amount.</p><p>Table 2 -Measured polarization angle and modulation factor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modulation factor Q vs distance</head><p>The aim of these experiment was to evaluate the modulation factor ð in function of the distance between detectors. These tests were done pointing the collimated beam onto four corner pixels on the top detector and we selected the double events that interacted in the two planes. By irradiating the matrix corner pixels we are able to obtain double event distributions throughout the crystal volume until fourth order pixels for two distances between detectors: 6 mm and 10 mm. These corresponds to scattering angles between ð TUV ~10Â° to ð TWX ~66Â° for 6 mm distance and ð TUV ~6Â° to ð TWX ~42Â° for 10 mm distance. Due to the low energy threshold of the system ~40 keV we expected that the minimum scattering angle is ~25Â° so we just used the double events of pixels that are above this threshold.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tilt Rotations</head><p>The last test was to evaluate the modulation factor ð when the detector is tilted 4Â°. The distance between detectors was 10 mm and the beam size is 1.0 Â´ 1.0 mm 2 .The tilt rotation causes misalignment in the beam and the detectors. Because we were interested in the top to bottom interactions we centered the beam in a bottom detector pixel so we cannot produce asymmetries in the bottom detector modulation, as the upper detector is used only as a scattering detector so the beam position does not matter, we just need to know which top pixel the first interactions occurs.</p><p>The results are shown in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and shows the decrease on Q when the detector is tilted as expected. This study shows once more the importance of a pointing system with accuracy better than 1Â° for an instrument designed for polarimetry. This accuracy should be sufficient so that double event distributions can be read directly with no further need of correction methods.</p><p>Table 5 -Measured polarization angle and modulation factor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions and Further Work</head><p>This was the first time that a bi-planar configuration detector was test as a polarimeter. The results showed that a future polarimeter with multi-layer configuration is potentially suited to perform polarimetric measurements for high energy astrophysics.</p><p>The detectors used were firstly evaluated individually and proved to have a good performance for polarimetric measurements. Regarding the 2 layers Compton configuration: we evaluate the modulation factor Q and its dependence with the distance between layers as well as its potential to determine the polarization angle orientation by performing measurements at different polarization direction angles. The results showed that the modulation factor Q decreases for higher distances between detectors. The reason for this result is the lower scattering angles for higher distances that affect the modulation factor Q. Regarding the potential to determine the polarization angle orientation the polarization angular resolution obtained was better that 8Â°.</p><p>A new polarimetric experiment with a multi-layer prototype is being prepared. A new prototype electromechanical design is being implemented that will allow to study the polarimetric performances in a wider energy range and to analyze in a finer pace Q vs distance between layers. The requirements for a future experiment are described below:</p><p>-In spite the good performance during the experiment, the detector bonds were mechanically weak and broke very easily, this constrained unexpectedly the experiment. In the next experiment we will use bare detectors with the same characteristics with a new electronic arrangement; -The time consuming and sensitive method to change distances between planes was another constrain that limited the experiment to two distances. The new configuration incorporates a micrometric system that can adjust the distance between detectors outside the detectors enclosure. We are also planning to use a new flexibly highdensity cable to connect the top plane to the ASICs, with enough length to match the distances we intend to study; -Different energy thresholds for the top and bottom detector. This could be achieved be separating the ASICs for each detector, i.e., an ASIC must not be shared in both detectors. In this configuration, the gain of each detector can be adjusted in the ASIC micro switches available. We can set the top detector for low energy photons and the bottom for high energy photons, so we can reduce the scattering angle of the photons that are scattered in the top detector; -A DC-DC bias circuit implemented outside the detector box to avoid noise and heat sources near the detector planes; -Improve x-y alignment between planes. This will be achieved by a new micrometric system that allow the movement of the top plane relatively to the bottom one. If the movement range in one direction is long enough we can also test the prototype for higher scattering angles; -Concerning the available beam at the ESRF, we were only able to test the setup for one energy because of the time-consuming method of changing energies at the ID 15A beamline. Furthermore, the energy tested was not the most convenient for our detectors due to Compton kinematics. For better results, we need to increase the beam energy so the first interaction could have sufficient energy to be detected and produce lower scattering angle photons. Ideally, for further measurements, we would prefer to use the wiggler source W76 on ID15A beamline that was not available in 2017 and provides a continuous spectrum up to 700 keV or more.</p><p>For these reasons, it is of major importance to perform a new campaign at the ESRF. We plan to test a new version of the multi-layer prototype system that allow to analyze the modulation factor Q as function of the distance between layers with a fine pace, in a wider energy band, allowing to simulate realistic polarimetric performances of multi-layer and 3D detector solutions in space configuration conditions. 3D detectors are the most promising focal plane solutions for hard X-and soft ð¾-ray missions, since they will address the following requirements: high scattering efficiency, achievable with increased thickness; high modulation factor achievable with better position sensitive detection; fine spectroscopy allowing effective background rejection and good event selection. The current prototype results and conclusions are determinant to validate and boost the development of innovative concepts to address high-energy astrophysics most relevant issues within e-ASTROGAM and ASTENA missions in the framework of H2020 AHEAD project.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Layout of a bi-planar polarimeter.
