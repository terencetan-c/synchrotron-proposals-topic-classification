<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The ternary compound Nd 2 Fe 14 B has properties superior in many respects to those of SmCo 5 , that coupled to the economic advantages over the earlier Sm-Co materials, have led to an intensive study of iron-rich ternary compounds based on rare earths. The range of temperature in which these new alloys are of technological significance is, however, strongly limited because ordering temperatures are low enough to render them unsuitable for some applications. In particular, Nd 2 Fe 14 B exhibits a spin reorientation transition (SRT) at about T=150 K that destroys the uniaxial anisotropy.</p><p>In the past, several attempts to change the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of Nd 2 Fe 14 B have been made as partial substitution of Nd by other magnetic rare-earth or by non-magnetic (Y,La,Lu) rare-earths species.</p><p>However, the results are nor satisfactory: in the first case the whole magnetic diagram is changed while in the second one the SRT temperature decreases as increasing the dilution but the uniaxial anisotropy is also strongly depressed.</p><p>A promising result has been found starting from a new route of modifying the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of Nd 2 Fe 14 B by the partial substitution of Nd by Eu. The magnetic ordering temperature, Tc, has been found to increase while the total magnetization decreases upon substitution. Moreover, it was expected the depletion of the spin reorientation temperature as Eu content increases. However, the contrary behavior has been found. This results points out the peculiarity of Eu electronic state. Whereas Eu 3+ has zero J as the non-magnetic rare-earths, L and S are large enough as to be susceptible to contribute to the uniaxial anisotropy as Nd.</p><p>However, the fist task to solve was to determine the exact electronic state of Eu in these new systems. To this end we have performed an x-ray absorption experiment at the Eu L 2,3 -edges at the experimental station BM29. In addition we have recorded also the XAS spectra at the Fe K-edge and at the Nd L 3 absorption edges.</p><p>The determination of the electronic state of Eu has been made by direct comparison of the absorption of the Eu-doped Nd 2 Fe 14 B samples to those of EuF 2 and EuF 3 , i.e. Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ respectively. In the case of Eu 2+ a typical double-peak edge is present while only one appears for Eu 3+ with a chemical shift of about 8 eV. Our results indicate that the electronic state of Eu is trivalent in the systems under investigation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, left panel). In addition our results shown that while Eu substitution gives rise to the strong modification of the Fe K-edge no modification of the Nd L edge is detected. This indicates that Eu doping increases the magnetic ordering temperature of Nd 2 Fe 14 B without to destroy the uniaxial anisotropy of the system. This result shows this new route of improving the technological performances of Nd 2 Fe 14 B as a very promising one.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
