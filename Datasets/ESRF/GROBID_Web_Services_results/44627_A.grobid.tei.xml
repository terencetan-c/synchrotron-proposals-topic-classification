<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have studied the influence of pressure on flow induced crystallization of polymers by fixing some flow conditions (piston speed of 15mm/s and piston displacement of 12mm) and afterwards rise pressure to 50 or 300bar. We focus essentially on the three following effects: 1) formation of the shish crystal, 2) growth of lamella, and 3) partial melting by de-pressurization. 1) After shear, no crystalline structure is observed when the pressure is kept at 50 bar, see Fig2a. However, when the pressure is increased to 300bar, a weak WAXD arc pattern appears in the equatorial direction (see Fig2b), suggesting the formation of shish type of crystals. The highly oriented crystals prove that oriented precursors were induced by flow, however due to their non-crystalline nature, they could not be observed with WAXD. Under a pressure of 300bar, the precursors refine their structure into a proper crystalline lattice. (a) (b)</p><p>2) After the formation of shish crystals, under a pressure of 300bar, twisted lamellae nucleate (indicated by offaxis arc pattern in Fig3a) and grow (see crystallinity evolution in Fig3b). This effect can be simply interpreted in terms of the increased undercooling due to the high pressure. Crystallinity levels off at about 7% after 2 min, whereas under 50bar, crystallinity did not appear within the experimental time (20 minutes). (a) (b)</p><p>3) After crystallizing under pressure of 300bar for 2 minutes, the pressure was reduced to 50bar. This process triggers partial melting of the crystalline structure that formed under 300bar, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>. (a) (b)</p><p>Further data analysis and interpretation is ongoing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants ( * indicates expermentalists): L.Balzano * , Z.
