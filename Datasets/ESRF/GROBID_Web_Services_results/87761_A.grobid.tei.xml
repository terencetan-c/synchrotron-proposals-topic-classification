<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background Information</head><p>The physics of ionic insulators at energies below the band gap opened between fully occupied and empty atomic states is often trivial. Under certain conditions, electron-electron interactions may alter this picture by giving rise to low-energy bosonic excitations. This is the case of LaCoO3, a structurally simple quasicubic material with complex magnetic and transport properties studied since the 1950s. LaCoO3, a diamagnetic insulator with a low-spin (LS, S = 0, 1 A1g) ground state and a band gap between filled t2g 6 and empty eg 0 subshells, becomes a paramagnetic insulator around 100 K. This behavior is traditionally attributed to thermal population of excited atomic multiplets. The high-spin (HS, S = 2, t2g 4 eg 2 , 5 T2g) or intermediate-spin (IS, S = 1, t 5 2ge 1 g, 3 T1g) nature of the lowest excited state has been the subject of an ongoing debate. Both HS and IS scenarios evoke an important question. Decorating the lattice with excited atoms leads to sizable distribution Co-O bond lengths due to breathing distortion around HS atoms or Jahn-Teller distortion around IS atoms. At experimentally reported concentrations, the excited atoms are expected to form a regular lattice, an effect favored by electron-lattice coupling, as well as electronic correlations. Nevertheless, no spin-state order nor Co-O bond-length disproportionation was observed in LaCoO3. This leaves the possibility of dynamically fluctuating spin-state order, for which, however, the picture of thermal atom-bound excitations provides no mechanism. </p></div>

The RIXS spectra exhibit low-energy features observed in previous studies. At 20 K, we observe a clear dispersion of the peak in 0.2-0.5 eV range that was assigned to the IS ( 3 T1g) excitation. The HS ( 5 T2g) excitation observed below 0.1 eV shows no dispersion. The IS dispersion is consistent with the theory and experiment of Ref., see Fig.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>†</head><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Ru-pan Wang*, Marte van der Linden*, Frank M.F de Groot*, Yohei Uemura*, Mahnaz Ghiasi*, Atsushi Hariki † , Andrii Sotnikov † , Jan Kuneš † , Davide Betto^, Nicholas B.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>1(f), with substantially reduced error bars, provided by the present high energy resolution. Increasing the temperature above 100 K leads to a distinct narrowing and smearing of the dispersive feature, see Figs. 1(b)-1(e). Other spectroscopic studies indicated growing concentration of HS excitations with temperature, while the system remains a spatially uniform insulator. This work has been published on Phys. Rev. B (Phys. Rev. B 101, 245162 (2020)).</figDesc></figure>
