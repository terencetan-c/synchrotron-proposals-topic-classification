<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>It is the aim of this project to study the local structure surrounding the metal substitutes in In 2 S 3 alloyed with V, Ti, or Nb in order to develop and understand intermediate band materials for application in thin film solar cells. The question of whether the metal atoms are incorporated on octahedral or tetrahedral lattice sites in the defect spinel-type structure of In 2 S 3 is particularly important in this regard.</p><p>Polycrystalline In 2 S 3 thin films with a thickness of approximately 1 µm and substituted with V, Ti, or Nb were prepared by co-evaporation on either glass or silicon substrates <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The growth temperature was varied from 300 to 500 °C. The chemical composition was determined by energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealing concentrations of the metal substitutes between 0.1 and 5 at%. Crystal structure and morphology of the films are analysed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>EXAFS spectra had to be recorded in fluorescence mode due to the low concentration of the metal substitutes. Unfortunately, the technologically relevant glass substrate containes small amounts of Ti, thus rendering the as-grown films on glass unsuitable for fluorescence measurements. Therefore, a set of thin films were grown on silicon substrates. Additionally, thin films grown on glass substrates were scraped off with a cleaved piece of silicon wafer and mixed with high purity graphite powder. Subsequently, the mixture was ball-milled and then pressed into pellets of 8 mm diameter. TiO 2 and V 2 O 5 reference samples were prepared from commercially purchased nanopowders in a similar fashion.</p><p>Measurements were first attempted at the Ti K-edge (4.966 keV). However, due to the low beam intensity in this energy range and the low concentration of Ti in the samples, the fluorescence signal was too weak to record any reasonable spectra. At the V K-edge (5.465 keV), the beam intensity is already significantly higher. The detectable intensity of the resulting V fluorescence was further increased by replacing the Be window sealing the sample chamber towards the detector with a more transmitting Kapton foil. Putting the chamber under vacuum was not possible in this configuration, however, due to the large size of the Kapton window. Therefore, cooling of the samples was not feasible and the spectra were recorded in He atmosphere at room temperature instead. Two different V 2 O 5 reference samples, a pure In 2 S 3 sample and five different In 2 S 3 :V samples were</p><p>No T (°C) V (at%) 1 300 ~ 5 2 400 ~ 5 3 500 5.3 4 500 3.3 5 500 1.9 Table I: Growth temperature and V concentration for five In2S3:V samples measured at the V K-edge.</p><p>then successfully measured in this configuration. The In 2 S 3 :V samples differed with respect to both V concentration and growth temperature as summarized in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. All samples measured were graphite diluted powder pellets, which allowed the simultaneous measurement of a V reference foil in order to precisely align the energy scales of all spectra.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a) shows the k 2 -weighted EXAFS spectra for In 2 S 3 :V with ~ 5 at% V grown at either 300 or 500 °C. For each plotted spectrum, three or four measured spectra were merged. Reasonable data quality is observed up to a photoelectron wave number of k ~ 9 Å -1 . The corresponding Fourier transformations are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (b). A clear difference in both peak position and peak height is observed, indicating differences in bond length, coordination number and disorder. Similar spectra were obtained for the other three In 2 S 3 :V samples.</p><p>A detailed analysis of all spectra is currently under way using the IFEFFIT software package [2] and the computer code FEFF9 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Changes in the edge position measured for the different spectra could hint at changes in the average valence state of the V atoms. Moreover, structural parameters determined from an analysis of the EXAFS region, including bond length and coordination number, will reveal whether the V atoms are preferrably incorporated on octahedral or tetrahedral lattice sites. The latter is crucial for the development of intermediate band materials and will help to understand their formation as a function of growth conditions.</p><p>[1] L.
