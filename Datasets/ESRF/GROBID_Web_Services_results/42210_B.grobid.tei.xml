<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Due to a mismatch between the timing of beamtime allocation and experimental work, we could not perform the proposed study. Instead, we used the beamtime at DUBBLE for a pilot study to determine the potential of XAS for the speciation of Ag in sewer systems.</p><p>Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP) are used in a wide range of products because of their antimicrobial properties. The amounts of Ag-NP used are rapidly increasing, but little is known about their environmental impact. From most applications, Ag-NP are emitted into sewer systems. Therefore, the retention of Ag-NP in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is a critical factor controlling the potential exposure of environmental systems to Ag-NP and their transformation products. Thus, in order to assess potential environmental risks associated with the increasing use of Ag-NP, the processes controllling their retention and transformation in WWTP must be understood. In this context, information on Ag speciation is essential.</p><p>We performed a preliminary study to investigate the potential use of Ag K-edge XAS for determining Ag speciation in wastewater and sewage sludge focusing on two systems:</p><p>1) Speciation of Ag emitted from an industrial laundry using AgCl at three locations: Laundry effluent (~500 μg/L Ag), WWTP influent (~5 μg/L Ag) and WWTP sludge (~45 mg/kg Ag).</p><p>2) Speciation of activated sewage sludge from a pilot WWTP run with Ag-NP-spiked wastewater (~1500 mg/kg Ag-NP in sludge).</p><p>The Ag K-edge XANES and EXAFS spectra of these samples were recorded at room temperature in fluorescence mode at the DUBBLE beamline. For the interpretation of experimental spectra by linear combination fitting, a series of reference materials were analyzed (in transmission mode), amongst others metallic Ag, Ag-NP, AgCl, Ag 2 S, Ag 2 O, thiol-bound Ag + , Ag-lactate, and aqueous Ag + . Reference spectra and experimental spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and results from the analysis of experimental XANES and EXAFS spectra by linear combination fitting are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Reference spectra of metallic Ag, sulfur-coordinated Ag and oxygen-coordinated Ag produced clearly distinguishable spectra both in the XANES and EXAFS region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Linear combination fitting of the experimental spectra with the five most suitable reference spectra returned similar results for the XANES and EXAFS region (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Ag 2 O was included as proxy for oxygen-coordinated Ag). In the laundry effluent, AgCl used in the washing process was still detected but most Ag was sulfur-bound, either by complexation with thiol groups or as Ag 2 S. Sulfur-coordination further increased towards the WWTP influent and dominated Ag speciation in the WWTP sludge. In the case of the pilot WWTP plant running with Ag-NP treated wastewater, about 50% of the metallic Ag-NP had transformed into sulfur-coordinated Ag within the sludge (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). These first results emphasize that Ag undergoes substantial changes in speciation within sewer systems, with sulfur-coordination playing a major role. The data further demonstrated the possibility of speciating particulate Ag in water at concentrations as low as 5 μg/L (after pre-concentration of the particulate phase on filter membranes). With respect to Ag-coordination with sulfur, distinction between thiol-bound Ag + and Ag 2 S is not always unequivocal. Distinction between these species however could be improved by measuring spectra at 77K rather than at room temperature.

We plan further studies to investigate the fate of silver nanoparticles of different sizes and with different surface functionalization during wastewater treatment in order to provide a robust basis for the assessment of their transmission into the aquatic environment. Ag K-edge XAS will represent the perfect tool to rationalize macroscopic observations on the basis of distinct chemical species.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Ag speciation in wastewater and wastewater treatment sludge</figDesc></figure>
