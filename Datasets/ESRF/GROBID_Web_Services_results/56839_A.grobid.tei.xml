<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results:</head><p>The increasing need of the green energy and high technology sectors for rare metals (REE are HFSE) requires a better understanding of the processes favoring the formation and controlling the grade of rare metal ore deposits. The main aim of our experiments is to provide new constraints on the role of hydrothermal fluids in the formation of rare metals mineralization in large igenous provinces (e.g., Bayan Obo, ChinaThor Lake, Canada) by studying the REE high temperature aqueous chemistry using in situ XAS. To complement previous in situ XAS experiments investigating Yb solubility and speciation up to 400 °C (Experimental Report 20140566), we have now determined the efffect the effect of Cl, Si and Na on the speciation and solubility of Gd from 200 to 500 °C at 80 MPa. The experimental results provide unexpected insights on the role of fluid composition on REE mobilization and transport in hydrothermal systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study:</head><p>The experiments were conducted in the high temperature autoclave dedicated to in situ X-Ray absorption spectroscopy of hydrothermal fluids available on the BM30-B beamline <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. XAS spectra collected around the Gd L III -edge (7.243 keV) in transmission and fluorescence modes were used to determine both the speciation and the solubility of Gd in the high temperature fluids, using similar technique as described in <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3]</ref>. First, the effect of increasing Cl concentrations and decreasing pH on Gd solubility and speciation in acidic fluids (pH&lt;3) was investigated loading pieces of synthetic Gd 2 O 3 , GdPO 4 or Gd 2 Si 2 O 7 with 0.35-0.75m HCl solutions. As observed for Yb (Experimental Report 20140566) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, GdPO 4 exhibits significantly lower solubility than Gd 2 Si 2 O 7 and Gd 2 O 3 at T&lt;300 °C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). While all compounds present strongly retrograde solubility, increasing HCl contents appears to delay the solubility decrease to around 350 °C in 0.75m HCl compare to 250 °C in 0.35m HCl. In the 0.35m HCl solution, both Gd 2 Si 2 O 7 and GdPO 4 solubilities are below the limit of detection (~10-20 ppm) at 450 °C, while Gd concentrations in 0.75m HCl remain above detection limit up to 500 °C. Although the reported effect of HCl concentrations could just be related to a pH effect (e.g. REE solubility is higher in low pH -3), XANES and EXAFS spectra suggest that Gd speciation evolves both with increasing temperature and HCl contents. The XANES spectra and EXAFS oscillations of Gd in the 0.75m HCl are flatter and shifted to higher position compare to the 0.35m HCl (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). There are also significant changes of the XANES spectra in 0.75m HCl with increasing temperature, including a strong increase of the white line amplitude at T&gt;300 °C that is attributed to a complete change of the local geometry around Gd. Preliminary EXAFS modeling confirms the significant change of Gd local environment with increasing temperature and Cl contents. In the 0.35m HCl solution Gd coordination number decreases slightly from 9 to 8 while increasing temperature from 125 to 242 °C. The Gd-O bond distance remains constant around 2.41 ± 0.02Å within this temperature range. The dissolution of Gd as Gd(H 2 O) 9-8 + is in good agreement with solubility models that suggest the high stability of REE aqua ions at low temperature and low Cl contents <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. At 287 °C, the hydration number further decrease towards 6, while Gd-O bond distance increases to ~2.45 Å. For similar Cl contents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref> reported a reduction of Gd hydration shell associated with the onset of chlorination (involving ~1 Cl atom) at 300 °C. Such low number of Gd-Cl association could not be included in our fits. It is only at 385 °C that we monitor a significant speciation change that is modeled by a structure involving about 6 O and 2 Cl atoms located at 2.38 Å and 2.67 Å, respectively. We note that the incorporation of Cl in Gd local-environment is not associated to significant changes of the EXAFS oscillations shape and position (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). A similar observation can be made from experiments by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>. At higher Cl contents (0.75mHCl), the fits suggest that Gd hydration shell only involves 5-6 oxygens located at ~2.43 Å at 200 and 242 °C. The hydration number further decreases to about 4 at 287 and 334 °C, though no obvious Gd-Cl association could be modeled. At 385 °C and 439 °C, the quality of the fits are significantly improved by adding 4 and 3 Cl atoms around Gd. Both structures provide similar Gd-O and Gd-Cl bond distances, which makes it for now unclear whether GdCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 0 or GdCl 4 (H 2 O) 4 -is the dominant specie at T ≥ 385 °C. While REECl 2+ and REECl 2 + are generally considered the most stable chloride complexes in hydrothermal fluids [4], calculations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref> predicted that at T &gt;200 °C, the formation of high-order chloro-complexes involving 3-4 Cl should be significantly more favorable for Gd (and Dy) than Yb. Our preliminary results suggest that such complexes could in fact dominate Gd speciation in Cl-bearing fluids and should hence be further considered in future solubility models. We also note that such high-order Gd complexes have recently been invoked to explain extreme Gd enrichment in volcanic fumarolles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref>.</p><p>In a second part of our experiments, we tested a new hypothesis regarding the nature of hydrothermal fluids involved in REE transport and deposition in magmatic-hydrothermal environment. In a previous study, <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9]</ref> suggested that the formation of alkali-silicate complexes could significantly enhance HFSE solubility and favor their transport in Si,Na-rich high-temperature fluids. While such fluids have not yet been reported in rare metal deposits, HFSE-REE-rich hydrosilicate liquids (HSL -'gel-like' fluids rich in silicates and alkalis) have been identified in pegmatites <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, Si,Na-rich single-phase fluids containing between 20 and 70 wt% dissolved Si and Na are known to be stable over a wide P-T range in the H 2 O-Na 2 Si 2 O 5 system [11], and could hence be expected to form in fluorine and phosphorus-rich highly peralkaline systems such as some reported in association with REE mineralization (e.g., Dubbo/Toongi, Australia). Therefore, we investigated the potential of Si,Na-rich to mobilize and transport REE, loading Gd 2 O 3 with H 2 O and a piece of synthetic Na 2 Si 2 O 5 glass (NS2). At 200 °C, Gd 2 O 3 solubility in pure H 2 O is well-below our detection limit, we report up to 2500 ppm Gd in the H 2 O-NS 2 system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), a solubility almost as high as in the 0.35m HCl solution. At 287 °C, we report systematic precipitation of Gd 2 O 3 , which is due to unmixing of the H 2 O-NS2 'gel-like' fluid to form an H 2 O-rich aqueous fluid and a NS2 melt <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Upon quench, a REE-rich sodium silicate melt globules was recovered, confirming</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">!2# 0# 2# 4# 6# 8# 10# 12# 2# 3# 4# 5# 6# 7# 8# 0.35mHCl_125C# fit# 0.35mHCl#200C# 0.75mHCl_200C# fit# fit# 0.35mHCl_242C# 0.75mHCl_242C# fit# fit# 0.</formula><p>35mHCl_287C# fit# 0.75mHCl_287C# fit# 0.35mHCl_385C# fit# 0.75mHCl_385C# fit# 0.75mHCl_439C# fit# 125 °C 200 °C 242 °C 287 °C 385 °C 439 °C 0 10 6 8 4 2 2 3 7 8 4 5 6 k (Å -1 ) k 2 χ(k) 0.35mHCl 0.75mHCl Fig.2 : EXAFS oscillations of Gd in 0.35m and 0.75m HCl solutions with increasing temperature.

Those results provide evidence for a potential role of Si,Na-rich 'gel-like' fluids in the formation of rare metals deposits that we expect to further test in an upcoming experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>The BM30-B beamline provides a unique environment for the in situ study of aqueous fluids at the P-T relevant to the hydrothermal precipitation of economic minerals in shallow crustal environments (200 &lt; T &lt; 600 °C and P &lt; 200 MPa). The unpredicted formation of high-order Gd chloro-complexes and the enhanced Gd solubility in Si,Na-rich fluids both confirm the critical inputs of the in situ approach to provide new insights on the REE aqueous chemistry and the potential effect of fluid composition on the formation of rare metals ore deposits. In comparison to previous experiments at the Yb L III -edge (Experimental Report 20140566), the use of thinner Be high pressure windows (1.5mm) enable to significantly decrease the limit of detection for REE (i.e., now ~10-20 ppm for Gd, while it was close to 100 ppm with thicker Be windows). Recourse to this design should now facilitate future measurements at the Nd L III -edge. Unfortunately, different experimental and optical problems have been encountered during the allocated beamtime: the beam became increasingly defocused several times and critical parts of the high pressure vessel had to be replaced, most probably due to normal wear. Overall, we estimate that those problems resulted in the loss of at least 5 shifts and significantly compromised the interpretation of solubility in many runs. Furthermore, most of these troubles occurred at the beginning of experiments, i.e., at T&lt;300 °C, well below the most interesting temperature conditions for our study. Therefore, a follow-up proposal will be submitted in September 2015, with the aim to complete our actual data-set on the Nd, Gd and Yb solubility and speciation in high temperature fluids.</p></div>
