The possibility of sagittal focusing of SR by an asymmetric Laue crystal with profiled surface was experimentally demonstrated in our last experiment MI -751. This time we used two identical samples of Si single crystals with two parallel holes of the diameter of 8 mm (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) in a dispersive arrangement. The axes of the holes formed an angle of 7.95° with (111) diffracting planes. The minimum thickness of this Laue crystal was 0.5 mm.The 15.35 keV SR was diffracted in the space between the holes. The impinging and diffracted beam formed the angle of 0.55° with the local surface. The diffracted beam entered the second crystal under the same angle and was diffracted as well. The dispersive setting was used in the goal of canceling both the vertical and horizontal spread of the focus observed in the previous experiment. We observed a diffraction with a focusing effect (convergent beam) after the first crystal (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and after the second crystal (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) separately. After arranging the two crystals in a dispersive setting, we observed a diffraction, but with a quite different shape and possition as predicted (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). It turns out that it is not easy to observe a straight result of a focusing effect after the twocrystal arrangement due to its very delicate and sensitive settings. The displacement of the diffraction, which was found a little bit of the center, could be due to the different heights of both crystals with respect to the beam. Without any focusing effect, we would observe a horizontal (sagittal) divergence of the diffracted beam, which was not the case. The experiment confirmed the predicated convergence of the beam. Furthermore, additional interesting diffracting effects, like interference pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and scattering (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) were observed, whose origins are not clear and they are being intensively studied. We try to work out suitable models which could explain the origin of the observed diffracting effects and particularly the interference fringes. In order to get the maximum focusing effect we chose the wavelength such that the angle between the beam and the crystal surface was very small, 0.55 0 . Grazing incident scattering is very sensitive to (sub)surface inhomogenities, which in our case could be present even if the mechanochemical polishing was applied. Probably due to the scatering from the surface which we did not expect the diffracting spot is not sharp enough to calculate the focusing distance. On the other hand, the nature of the observed interference pattern and the scattering phenomena should be studied in detail. For this reason the experiment should be repeated with somewhat shorter wavelenght and better definition of the impinging beam. It will be very useful to compare this experiment with the measurement on 0.5 mm thick flat Laue crystal with the same asymmetry. Such a flat crystal may be better polished which should allow to separate the focusing image from effects caused by the scattering from the insufficiently flat surface. This may help to explain the nature of the interference pattern.  </p></div>
