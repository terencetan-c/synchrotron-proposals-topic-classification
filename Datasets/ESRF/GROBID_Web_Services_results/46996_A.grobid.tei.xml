<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the experiment</head><p>Primary aim of this experiment was to determine a depth profile of the oxidational state of noble metal films, which were deposited in oxidizing environment. In order to be able to link the depth profile to the exact sample structure, X-ray reflectivity measurements were planned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample description:</head><p>For the experiment HE-3605, four different thin films were prepared on previously annealed hydrothermally-grown oxygen-terminated c-ZnO substrates (purchased from Crystec). Subsequently, films were deposited using DC magnetron sputtering of Au and Pt. For each metal, one film was deposited in argon atmosphere and one film in a mixed argon/oxygenatmosphere. The deposition conditions were adapted, such that the thickness of the all thin films was about 20 nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement conditions:</head><p>Generally, all measurements could be comfortably performed and the local contacts supported the work satisfactorily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obtained Results:</head><p>For each sample, the zinc L 1 2s-level was measured. Furthermore, for each metal one core level was measured. The beam energy was varied between 9 keV and 16 keV. In the following the results obtained for the Pt grown in oxidizing conditions are sketched.</p><p>From the XRR spectrum, recorded at a photon energy of 9 keV, the thickness and the density of the overlayer film was extracted using the IMD extension of the XOP software package (cmp. fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The respective inelastic mean free path was calculated using the TPP-2M formula and the simulated depth dependence of the photoemission contribution reveals that the contribution of the interfacial region can be tuned by about a factor of three for the applied photon energy range. The core level spectra of the overlayer, corrected by a fitted background (using UNIFIT 2011 software) are depicted in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). Here, the photon energy was already corrected with the spectral position of the substrate core level. Luckily, the Zn exhibits a very low chemical shift, making the possible changing degree of oxidation of the Zn within the substrate unimportant. The peak position is obviously neither constant nor monotonically shifting with changing beam energy, which indicates a remaining charging effect for some samples. Therefore, for the following fitting procedure, the spectral position of the Pt 0 3d 3/2 core level has to remain as free fitting parameter. Generally, the overlayer spectra are fitted with a combination of 3 Voigt profiles, representing the known Pt oxidational states: Pt 0 , Pt +2 and Pt +4 . The resulting energetic position of the Pt 0 level is depicted in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>), reproducing the already mentioned uncertainty in the calibration of the photon energy. From the peak areas of the components, the fraction of the respective oxidational state can be calculated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, the experiment was successfull in terms of the determination of the depth profile of the oxidational state of reactively sputtered platinum on zinc oxide substrates. Thus, a valuable insight into the functionality of rectifying contacts to zinc oxide was gained.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: X-ray reflectivity measurement for film thickness determination at a beam energy of 9 keV (λ=1.38 Å).
