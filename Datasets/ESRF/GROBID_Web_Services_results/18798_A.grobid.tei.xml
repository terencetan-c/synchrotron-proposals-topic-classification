<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We recently solved the structure of the cytochrome bc 1 -complex from S. cerevisiae bound to an antibody Fv fragment at 2.3 Å resolution <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. This mitochondrial oligomeric membrane protein is one of the fundamental components of the respiratory chain. It catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, while the process is coupled to electrogenic translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Still, the molecular basis of fundamental processes of the enzyme mechanism is not known, e.g. the oxidation of quinol, the identity of primary proton donors during quinone reduction or the importance buried water molecules shown in the yeast structure for proton transfer pathways.</p><p>For the first time we obtained crystals without stigmatellin but in the presence of a different Qo site inhibitor. While the spacegroup (C2) of these crystals remained unchanged, the cell constants were slightly altered. We obtained a data set at 2.5 Å resolution, 92 % completeness and 6.6 % R-merge by scaling data from several crystals. The refined structure shows conformational changes of side chains in the Qo binding pocket compared to the stigmatellin containing structure. The observed alterations will be discussed in respect to the processes of quinol oxidation, since the binding of stigmatellin is thought to resemble an intermediate step of the oxidation.</p><p>Two data sets were measured after soaking co-complex crystals with Qi site specific inhibitors: I. 2.8 Å resolution, 7.2 % R-merge (overall), 77 % completeness; II. 2.9 Å resolution, 6.7 % R-merge (overall), 80 % completeness. These data will be used to characterize the quinone binding site.</p><p>The yeast cytochrome bc 1 -complex is crystallized together with a bound antibody Fv fragment.</p><p>The fragment is mediating crystal contacts and is therefore essential for formation of the crystal lattice. We modified the recombinant fragment to facilitate faster protein purification. Cocrystals of the cytochrome bc 1 complex and these fragments were obtained. We determined the space group C2 and cell constants of 620Å, 327Å and 217Å for these crystals. X-ray diffraction was below 5 Å resolution, i.e. these crystals are unsuitable for data collection.</p><p>All data collection was performed at 4 °C. The start of data collection was delayed due to a defect in the cooling of the CCD-detector.</p><p>[1] C. Hunte, T., J. Koepke, C. Lange, T. Rossmanith and H.
