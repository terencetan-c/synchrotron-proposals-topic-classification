<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In contrast to imaging 18 FDG-6P at millimeter length scales using 18 FDG PET, synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy (XRF) <ref type="bibr">(Westneat et al. 2008</ref>) allows imaging the structurally identical molecule, albeit non-radiolabeled, at subcellular spatial resolution. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of direct mapping in brain of 19 F in FDG-6P using soft (low-energy) x-ray fluorescence (LEXRF) in vitro and in vivo for cerebral and retinal glia <ref type="bibr">(Poitry-Yamate et al. 2013a</ref>). Those results were later extended to show that cerebral neurons also transport and phosphorylate 19 FDG (Poitry-Yamate et al.  2013b), an indication that both glial cells and neurons are glycolytically active. In proposal MD-711, we sought in vivo evidence for the cellular locus of IAA uptake by imaging the distribution of iodine in IAA over cortical brain regions using hard (high-energy) x-ray fluorescence (HEXRF). In spite of its extended use since the 1930's (Webb 1966), IAA has hitherto not been imaged by any modality in the literature. This prompted us to first perform a proof of concept IAA HEXRF experiment in the visual system, i.e. retina of the CNS where the effect of IAA on structure, function and metabolism has been exceptionally documented at great length, e.g. <ref type="bibr">(Noell 1951)</ref>. The rationale linking IAA and FDG-6P imaging and CMRglc follows from our working hypothesis that brain cells metabolizing endogenous glucose-6P down the glycolytic pathway during 18 FDG PET imaging are directly sensitive to the effects of IAA. Gadolinium measurements were also performed on brain tissue, and served as control samples within the context of the present project. Iodoacetate (IAA), a compound of choice to inhibit the metabolism of glucose through glycolysis to pyruvate/lactate, was administered systemically in rats to evaluate its effect on brain glucose utilization and its cellular target of uptake. Coadministration of iodoacetate (40mg/kg) and [ 18 F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ( 18 FDG, 50MBq) under euglycemic conditions reduced the mean rate of resting cerebral glucose utilization (CMRglc), from 50.1 0.3 to 23.6 0.3 mol/100g/min. Time-activity curves showed that 18 FDG extraction by the brain was reduced by IAA, while Patlak graphical analysis and 3-compartment modeling showed that this reduced extraction was linked to a reduction of phosphorylated 18 FDG per unit time, and not to glucose transport. IAA's concentration-dependent effect on intracellular metabolism was temporally linked to secondary increases of 18 FDG in plasma, and hyperglycemia at 50 min post-injection, at which time imaged 18 FDG-6P fell from 2.57 0.26 g/ml to 1.97 0.21 g/ml. These results suggest that IAA's inhibitory effect, at concentrations that block retinal glycolysis in vivo, limited cerebral ATP availability for the hexokinase reaction. Under these neuroglycopenic conditions, synchrotron-based hard x-ray fluorescence mapping of cortical IAA at &lt;1 micron spatial resolution was performed. Surprisingly, IAA was disproportionately high in cortical pyramidal neurons and interneurons, and its subcellular distribution mirrored that of 19 FDG-6-phosphate (Poitry-Yamate et al. 2013b). These results indicate that glycolytically active brain cells are directly sensitive to the effects of IAA, and they lend support for a glycolytic capacity of neurons in vivo. We concluded that both neurons and astrocytes contribute to the non-invasive 18 FDG PET signal.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Validation of HEXRF imaging of IAA in vivo at 1 m 2 resolution.
