<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Aim of the experiment</head><p>The aim of the present experiment is to investigate the low frequency dynamics in ionic liquids (ILs) using grazing incidence X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (GIXPCS), in the temperature regime in which the effect of viscosity is dominating, in order to provide information on how the strong damping of fluctuations due to an exponentially increasing structural relaxation time alters the capillary waves dynamics as measured by GIXPCS on approaching the glass transition temperature T g . For the present investigation we choose the ionic liquid PyR 14 TFSI (N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium bis[trifluoromethyl(sulfonyl)]imide). The glass transition temperature for this IL, as reported from calorimetry, is T g =183 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Dynamic surface height-height correlation functions g <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> (t) where measured with an avalanche photodide detector (APD) for different values of the axchanged momentum q x parallel to the surface, and for different temperatures. High quality data could be obtained over a large temperature and exchange momentu range. A selection of the g <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> (t) is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.a for a fixed value of q x . The data have been analyzed according to an exponential relaxation model .</p><p>(1) The extracted relaxation rates Γ(q x ,T) are reported, for all accessed temperatures and momenta, in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.b. Moreover, a linear regression procedure over the lowest q x points (see figure caption for more details) provides the angular coefficient D and intercept C of the Γ(q x ,T) trend. According to a Voigt-Kelvin model of viscoelasticity, the complex storage modulus is related to viscosity η and elasticity E: G(ω)=E-iωη. Once put into a linearized Navier-Stokes equation, this form of G(ω) gives the following behavior for the relaxation rate:</p><p>(2) Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: a. Normalized intensity autocorrelation functions g <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> (q x ,t), obtained from GIXPCS on PYR 14 TFSI for a fixed value of q x , and for temperatures ranging from 233 K to 300 K. The data have been normalized to the intercept value. Lines are fit to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). b. Relaxation rate Γ(q x ) for the temperatures investigated. Lines are linear fits (on the first 9 q x points) Γ=Dq x +C. c. Elasticity for PYR 14 TFSI as computed from Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). The melting point is indicated as a dashed line.</p><p>where γ is the surface tension. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.c the elasticity extracted from the linear fits of the relaxation rate as a fucntion of temperature, according to Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), is reported. We find that on cooling elasticity sets in at a temperature T E above T m . Moreover, from Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.b we find that for T&gt;T E a strong bending of the relaxation rate is observed at the highest accessed q x values. Thus, the temperature T E marks the onset of a new dynamical behavior. It has been proposed for molecular liquids that an elasticity E≠0 could be related to the occurrence of dynamical and structural heterogeneities, characterized by a slow relaxation rate, even several decades slower than the typical structural relaxation, which makes them appear as elastic clusters on the experimental time scales [1,2]. Moreover, the observed phenomenology, especially the onset of elasticity in PYR 14 TFSI at a well defined temperature, may be related to the ionic nature of this system. In perspective, a focused GIXPCS investigation on selected ILs, in the neat liquid and supercooled regimes, would provide confirmation of the present results as well as a more thorough understanding of the underlying dynamical phenomena.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Stefano Cazzato* (1), Maria Grazia Izzo* (1), Aleksandar Matic* (1) and Per Jacobsson (1).</figDesc></figure>
