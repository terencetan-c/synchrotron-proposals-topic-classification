<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary tests in preparation of beamtime in Fall 2021</head><p>These tests were done outside of the hutch and no beamtime was used. The purpose was to test the ESRF facility in terms of building compressed air for the experiment to come. This project aims at characterizing the dense two-phase flow exhibited in coaxial two-fluid atomization at high gas velocities. Hence, the flow loop for atomization, without the atomizer (no sample required) was brought to ESRF and the range of flow rates achievable was tested thoroughly for a couple of hours, as well as their stability.</p><p>The experiment was reduced to the compressed air lines only (no water) and consisted of tubbing, fittings, filters, pressure regulators, proportional valves, and flowmeters, controlled and monitored using a computer. The conclusion of these tests was that about a third of the operating conditions (highest flow rate) to investigate in Fall 2021 would require nitrogen cylinders, while the rest of the conditions could be performed using the building's compressed air supply seamlessly. Fours cylinders were requested prior to the experiments and permitted the good operation of the experiments during the Fall beamtime, so every condition was taken.</p><p>Experiment under proposal ME 1585 following this no-beam preparation work occurs from 17 to 20/09/2021 and lead to the following results:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample details</head><p>The sample is a water jet with an exit diameter of 2 mm, destabilized and fragmented by a high-speed air jet. Due to the large difference in absorption coefficients, only water is measured. The beam slits are adjusted to have a fairly homogenous beam over the measurement regions and reach a field of view of around 8x6 mm².</p><p>The beam traverses the sample and is absorbed by a scintillator that reemits in visible lights, which is captured by a Photron SAZ1 camera (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). A fast shutter is implemented, synchronized with the camera, to allow for 1 second of acquisition. Beyond that time, the scintillator suffers mechanical failure due to the heat load, as high energy is required to reach exposure times of 2.5 µs. Longer exposure time would result in large motion blurs. The field-of-view of view can be further reduced, effectively cropping the images, to increase the sampling rate up to 100 kHz. The pixel size is fixed at 6.7 µm for the whole measurement series. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental set-up and measurements conducted</head><p>Much care was taken to prevent droplet presence and moisture in the hutch, even at extreme atomization conditions, as illustrated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. This was successful and the humidity did not increase throughout the 9 shifts. Building air supply was used for a large portion of the conditions undertaken, while the most extreme gas velocities (up to Mach 0.95) were attained using nitrogen gas cylinders provided by ESRF. The set-up, while cumbersome, was successfully installed and implemented in the hutch and all planned operating conditions were captured. 102 conditions were captured (despite data throughput issues and beam being down for half a shift), corresponding to 204 movies at various locations along the spray near-field as illustrated in Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Snapshot from the near-field of coaxial two-fluid atomization captured by back-lit visible light imaging over a large field of view, at a low gas and liquid velocities displaying a long liquid core and highlighting the flapping instability and bag-breakup. The dashed lines correspond to the different locations that were explored for this condition at ESRF, using higher spatial and temporal resolution to study the underlying physical phenomena of the break-up process. Conditions with higher gas-to-liquid dynamic pressure ratio exhibit smaller liquid core and required less locations to be captured (one window at the exit of the nozzle was sufficient for the most intense atomization condition, while the case used here required 7 windows).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary quantitative results and difficulties</head><p>Beyond the immense gain brought by the qualitative observations of the high-speed X-ray radiography images, we tried to develop a method to retrieve the Equivalent Path Length (EPL), representing the total amount of liquid that the beam encounter along its path (i.e. liquid mass distribution integrated along the beam direction). Large spatial and temporal variation of the recorded intensity were the main challenges and sources of experimental uncertainties in this venture. Using the program developed by Dr. A. Rack, ANKA Phase, we were nonetheless successful at recovery the EPL for the bulk of the liquid jet, i.e. the liquid core, and were able to study its morphology and define regimes based on quantitative indicators (statistical distributions of its center of mass, power spectra and residence times to study the temporal dynamics) as displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. and high gas injection velocities here). Two transitions between the reported regimes can be explained in terms of simple kinetic energy balance between both phases since they are separated by iso-M lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The experimental session at ESRF was greatly successful. A large quantity of data was capture, covering a large parameter space that allowed to define finely transition among uncovered regimes. The role of the liquid Reynolds number and liquid turbulence in coaxial atomization will become much clearer thanks to this study. The results were already presented and well received by the community at the following international conference: N. Machicoane, O. Tolfts, A. Rack, 11th International Conference on Multiphase Flow, Kobe, Spray formation in two-fluid coaxial atomization with high-speed gas, from April 2 to 7, 2023. A publication is also in preparation for an international peer-reviewed journal. Future work would ideally tackle the role of gas turbulence is spray formation, which could explain the discrepancy between various works in the literature, since this parameter is often overlooked and not reported. The PI recently received funding by ANR to study this phenomenon (ANR JCJC FragTurb, 2023-2027).</p><p>Numerous difficulties were encounter and at least partially overcome, for this experiment. Beyond the difficulty mentioned earlier concerning intensity variations that makes quantitative results extraction harder, the amount of data and the associated processing time posed challenges already. However, a framework was implemented, and can now be built upon for future analysis on this data and future data to be collected. A list of improvements for future beamtime measurements was compiled, such as implementing synchronization between acquisitions and electron cycles in the ring, designing a calibration object to be placed at all times on the side of the field of view to drastically simplify analyses and increase measurement accuracy, and including the beam polychromatic nature in the analyses.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
