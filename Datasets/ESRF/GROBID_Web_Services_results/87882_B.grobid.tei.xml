The beamline and in situ aparatus have behaved nicely with no technical issues during the experiments, except that there was ~4 hour beam loss due to the storage rin shutdown.</p><p>The aim of this study was, using the in situ XAS techniques, to measure the coordination structure and solubility of molybdenum in hydrothermal chloride and hydrosulphide-bearing hydrothermal vapour and liquid at up to 600 °C and 100-1000 bar, so as to better understand the transport and deposition properties of Mo ore systems.</p><p>The objectives of the study have been largely achieved: we have measured EXAS and XANES spectra of total 18 solutions at temperature up to 450˚C and 800 bar. In general the data collected from the solution phase are of good quality at temperature up to 400˚C, but at higher temperatures and in the low density fluids the Mo oxides started to precipitates therefore we were not be able to measure the solubility/speciation of Mo in the vapour phase.</p><p>The XAS data of two series of sample solutions have been successfully collected:</p><p>1.</p><p>Mo speciation in sodium hydrosulphide solutions: We have for the first time identified a Mo-S species (likely species between MoO4 2-and MoS4 2-) predominate in the NaHS solutions with NaHS concentration ranging from 0.07-2 mol/kg. The spectra changes as a function of NaHS concentration are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. 2.</p><p>Mo speciation in HCl-NaCl chloride solutions: We found that Mo-Cl-O speciation predominate in the NaCl-free acidic HCl solution, and possibly polynuclear species in the acidic HCl-NaCl solutions. With increasing temperature, molybdate species (e.g., HMoO4-of H2MoO4(aq) become important in both solutions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>We are now conducting detailed data fittings, and plan to use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to aid data interpretation, aiming a better understanding of Mo speciation in Cl and S-bearing hydrothermal fluids.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
