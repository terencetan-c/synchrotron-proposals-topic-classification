<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A new sample environment was designed and constructed at Imperial College London specificially for this experiment (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), which enables the delivery of reactants and solvents via a syringe pump, through a catalyst bed mounted in a quartz tube, which can be heated and pressurised. Different heterogeneous Pd catalysts, including PdEncat (encapsulated Pd(0) and Pd(II) in a polyurea matrix), Pd/Al 2 O 3 (1-10 mol% loading) were tested for their catalyst activity prior to arrival at ESRF (to verify real reaction conditions).</p><p>The experiments use the vertical focus of the beam, with the recently acquired QuEXAFS, as well as scanning EXAFS, to examine the transformation of heterogenised Pd(0) and Pd(II) species, when they are exposed to reaction mixtures, as well as the reaction solvent (in this case, ethanol). The sample environment was mounted on beamline BM23 on a Huber motor.</p><p>Reaction examined and results: 1. Heterogenised Pd species were initially examined using scanning EXAFS and used as reference for later examinations. Pd(OAc) 2 encapsulated in a polyurea matrix (EnCat30) and Pd(II) (predominantly hydroxide) deposited on an alumina support show decernable differences, both from each other and from their comparable Pd(0) catalystsnanoparticulate palladium encapsulated in a polyurea matrix (EnCatNP) and the same alumina supported palladium which had been calcined (2 h, 500 ºC) and reduced under H 2 .</p><p>2. The reaction solvent (ethanol) was subsequently passed through the catalyst bed, at ambient, as well as elevated (80 ºC) temperatures. At ambient temperature, this had no discernable chemical effect on the palladium. At elevated temperatures reduction of the palladium occurs. A controlled ramp of the temperature shows this process only begins to take place above approximately 40 ºC. QuEXAFS were initially used to track the changes in the coordination and oxidation state of the Pd species at a fixed point of the bed, followed by a full mapping of the bed using scanning EXAFS.</p><p>3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -200 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 2.75 2.755 2.76 2.765 2.77 2.775 2.78 2.785 -200 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 R1Pd Clear reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) can be observed when the catalyst bed is exposed to solvent, or a reaction mixture (consisting of aryl bromide, aryl boronic acid and base).. Preliminary results revealed some highly unusual observations (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Initial assessment seem to suggest that the reduction process initially led to the formation of Pd nanoparticles of approximately 3-4 nm in size (&lt;300 scans). With subsequent exposure to the reaction mixture (&gt;300 scans), the Pd-Pd bonds lengthen quite significantly. This could be suggestive of numerous things (including the formation of bulk PdC and PdH phases) but is important in that it demonstrates that under reaction conditions the Pd nanoparticles display physical characteristics that are not, a priori, expected. Catalyst leaching was also observed at the top of the catalyst bed, which may be captured by the introduction of a pristine bed of Al 2 O 3 .</p><p>3. In contrast, the PdENCAT catalyst displayed very different behaviour. Firstly, the encapsulated Pd(OAc) 2 (PdENCAT30) appear to undergo a much slower reduction to Pd(0). The nature of the final Pd(0) also appear to differ significantly from the Pd(0) species obtained from the reduction of Pd(OAc) 2 supported on Al 2 O 3 . Furthermore, no catalyst leaching was observed in this system, suggesting that PdENCAT may be more robust to reaction conditions than Pd on an inorganic supported.</p><p>4. Rather unexpectedly, with subsequent mapping of the catalyst beds, it appears that there is spatial speciation of Pd species at the beginning and the end of the catalyst bed. This is also a very exciting result which has never been previously observed, as it suggests that spatialtemporal mapping of the reduction process may be possible. This will form the basis of a further proposal.</p><p>5. We next examined the supported Pd(0) nanoparticles, also encapsulated in polyurea (PdENCATNP) and supported on Al 2 O 3 . The reduction of the surface palladium oxide (PdO) was observed by passing heated ethanol through both catalyst beds (for example, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). However, reduction to Pd(0) appears to be much more complete with the catalyst supported on alumina. The precise nature of the reduced species, and temporal evolution data will require further analysis. In summary, a number of very interesting observations have been made during the performance of these experiments with different Pd catalyst, which revealed very important dependence of catalyst activation, and subsequent leaching on the type of heterogeneous support used. Although this observation is not new, the data acquired will allow us to delineate, for the first time, the key molecular interactions that determines these processes, which certainly warrant further experimentation and analysis. Further follow-up work will also be conducted at Imperial, to correlate the catalyst activation/leaching process, with the above observations. We expect that our preliminary work (on the evolution of Pd-Pd distances) will be the first to be communicated via a publication, as well as disseminated by</p><p>Dr. Hii at the meeting she has been invited to speak at, in December 2011 (McBain Medal Lecture, SCI, London).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. King Kuok (Mimi) Hii, a, * Dr. Luis Adrio, a, * Dr. John Brazier, a, * Dr. Bao Nguyen, a, * Dr. Klaus Hellgardt, a, * Dr. Mark NEWTON b a Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ, U.K. b ESRF, 6 rue Jules Horowitz, BP220, 38043 Grenoble, France.</figDesc></figure>
