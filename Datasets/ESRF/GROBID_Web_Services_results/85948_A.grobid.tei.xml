<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Following the original proposal, a series of xCaO -xAl 2 O 3 -(100-2x)SiO 2 glass plates of a few mm and ~20-40 µm in thickness were prepared as a compromise between scattering intensity and contrast at the fixed incident energy of 8 keV. We further prepared a second series of 20CaO -yAl 2 O 3 -(80-y)SiO 2 similar plates. The main aim of the proposed experiment was to evidence a composition-driven change of beaminduced dynamics when crossing an expected rigidity transition around the CaAl 2 Si 3 O 10 glass composition (x=y=20).</p><p>Within the allowed beam time, eight of these CAS glasses have been studied at room temperature. The plates were put in a vacuum evacuated sample container placed into the beam. We first measured the static structure factor S(Q) and time-series of speckle patterns at the first maximum Q p of S(Q) using the standard wideangle setup. Speckle patterns were detected with an IkonM CCD from Andor Technology (1024×1024 pixels, 13×13 µm 2 pixel size) installed perpendicularly to the horizontal scattering plane, ~70 cm downstream of the sample. In this way, the detector covers a solid angle corresponding to a Q resolution of about 0.04 Å -1 .</p><p>A typical example of the obtained two-time correlation functions is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the x=5 glass. The contrast is very good for a silicate glass, about 6% at Q p = 1.53 Å -1 . A slight broadening of the diagonal can be detected with time indicating an evolution of the measured dynamics. The latter is better seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> where the normalized intensity auto-correlation function g 2 (Q,t) at two different irradiation times (yellow squares in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is calculated with a constant time-window of 900 s, corresponding to 250 frames. On a fresh spot (green open triangles), the decay is well described by a compressed exponential, 𝑔𝑔 2 (𝑄𝑄, 𝑡𝑡) = 1 + 𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒 -2(𝑡𝑡/𝜏𝜏) 𝛽𝛽 , where the shape exponent parameter 𝛽𝛽 ≈ 1.7 and 𝜏𝜏 ≈ 80 s. At longer times, the shape differs as 𝛽𝛽 decreases to 1.2 and 𝜏𝜏 increases to about 140 s. It clearly evidences that in these ternary glasses the beaminduced dynamics is not stationary but evolves with irradiation time. We also verified that this behavior is similar at all Q values between 0.6 and 2.0 Å -1 .</p><p>Interestingly we found that the beam-induced dynamics evolves with the glass composition indicating a change around the expected x=y=20 composition. The analysis of the large amount of data is still ongoing but we are confident that these results will strongly improve our knowledge on the glassy state and will surely deserve to be published.  Finally, we used the last day to test the feasibility of the study of the intrinsic structural relaxation time at temperature close to 𝑇𝑇 𝑔𝑔 . To that effect, we chose the x=35 composition which is characterized by the slowest beam-induced dynamics of the CAS series (𝜏𝜏 ≈ 3000 s). Approaching 𝑇𝑇 𝑔𝑔 from below we have indeed detected a sudden decrease of the measured relaxation time. This indicates that the intrinsic structural relaxation time takes over the beam-induced dynamics. For that glass, it clearly gives the unique opportunity to study the structural dynamics at the atomic scale over more than three decades in time across the glass transition region using the Eiger detector.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (left) Two-time correlation function measured at room temperature at the maximum structure factor S(Q) on the x=5 CAS sample.
