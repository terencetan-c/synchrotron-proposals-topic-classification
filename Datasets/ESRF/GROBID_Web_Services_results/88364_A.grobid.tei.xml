<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The primary objectives of the study were (i) to investigate change in protien/protein interaciton during freezethaw of solutions of model pharmaceutical proteins, and (ii) develop experimental set-up to perform SAXS measurements during reconstitution of freeze-dried protein powders. Both freeze-thaw and reconstitution behavior are of primary interest for both applied (e.g., pharmaceutical science and technology) and fundamental science. The main part of the experiment was devoted to freeze-thaw experiments. In-situ SAXS/WAXS was utilized as the main experimental method, with the measurements performed at the ESRF ID02 beamline, both during freeze-thawing of aqueous solutions of proteins and reconstitution of freeze-dried protein powders. Three proteins (GCSF and two mAbs) in different formulations (containing buffer, ±disaccharide, ±sugar alcohol, ±surfactant) were investigated. The solutions were filled into 1 mm O.D. (0.01 mm thickness) quartz capillaries and cooled/heated using a Linkam temperature stage between RT and -50C. In addition, SAXS patterns were collected during reconstitution of protein powders; where a flow cell was used in an experimental setup comprising of a pump to circulate a reconstitution diluent (water) and a vessel containing the lyophilized sample, and the freeze-dried cakes were powdered and transferred into a bottle for the experiment. In mAb solutions (5 to 100 mg/mL), a peak attributed to protein-protein interaction (structure factor) was observed by SAXS, whereas it was not detected in less concentrated solutions (0.5 mg/mL) (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The absence of the peak at 0.5 mg/mL is most likely because of the detection limitThe two shoulders, which are observed at q values of approx. 1 to 2 1/nm in the IgG solutions at 50 and 100 mg/ml, are attributed to the form factor (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The posiiton of these shoulders is similar in both 100 and 50 mg/ml solutions. The form factor corresponds to the shape of individual scattering structures (in this case, protein molecules), and therefore can be expected to be independent of the concentration. SAXS patterns of the mAb solution (100 mg/ml) during cooling are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (top). The shift in the peak position is observed when the sample is cooled from +20 to -10C (first scan at -10C, sample is not frozen yet), reflecting an increase in the protein/protein center-of-mass distance from approx. 18.5 to 21 nm (d-spacing ~ 0.3 1/nm) between 20 and -10C. Similar trend is observed for 50 mg/ml solution, with the peak interaction peak shifting to lower-q values as the sample is cooled form 20 to -10C, while the form factor shoulders remaining essentially the same (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, bottom). For the 5 mg/ml sample, the temperature shift of the protein interaction peak is not detected (SAXS patterns are not shown). Such temperature dependence of the protein interaction peak has not been reported previously. After maintaining -10C for several minutes, the sample froze as observed by WAXS (WAXS patterns not shown), and major changes are observed in the SAXS patterns (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The protein interaction peak is no longer observed, the scattering intensity at higher angles is significantly reduced, and the lower-angle scattering increases with the decrease in the scattering angle. Upon further cooling to -50C, relatively minor but reproducible changes are observed as follows: (i) Gradual development of a very broad and weak peak at q 1 to 2 1/nm as the sample is cooled from -20 to -30C, then to -40C, and finally to -50C; (ii) small increase in low-q scatter after cooling from -20 to -30C; no further changes at -40 and -50C. This observation was reproduced with a second sample of the same composiiton, as shown in Fig 3 <ref type="bibr">(bottom)</ref>. Representative SAXS patterns during thaw are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The freeze-induced changes in the SAXS patterns were reversed upon thawing of the solution.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> (top) shows SAXS patterns obtained for reconstituted protein in the flow cell. A peak attributed to protein-protein interactions (q= 0.2 to 0.6) was detected in solution post reconstitution; the two shoulder peaks are attributed to the form factor. Kratky plot is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> (bottom). Observation of peaks in the Kratky plot is indicative of a folded protein structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion. The preliminary analysis of the data revealed the following:</head><p>▪ Protein interaction peak(s) were observed in the unfrozen as well as partially frozen solutions. ▪ The protein interaction peak was not observed in the frozen solution → attributed to lack of sensitivity or due to structural changes in the protein ▪ In a partially unfrozen samples, immediately post thawing at 0C, the d-spacing was ≈16.5 nm; it increased to 19 nm on completion of thawing.</p><p>In addition, the experimental set-up to collect SAXS data during reconstitution of freeze-dried proteins was established. 0.1 1 0.01 0.1 1 Intensity, 1/mm q, 1/nm 20C 5C 0C -10C -10C (hold) 100 mg/ml mAb1 0.1 1 0.01 0.1 1 Intensity (1/mm) q (1/nm) 20C 5C 0C -10C -20C 50 mg/ml, mAb1 Figure 2.
