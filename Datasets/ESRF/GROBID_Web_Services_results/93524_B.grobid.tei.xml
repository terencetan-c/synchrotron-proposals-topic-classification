<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>For this experiment, a 150-nm thick film of Dy was grown by molecular beam epitaxy at Institut Jean Lamour, following a well established process. The film was split in 3 samples. 2 of them were patterned by optical lithography to obtain arrays of cylindrical dots of diameter 4 µm and 2 µm respectively. These micron size objects were designed to facilitate the positioning of the focused X-ray beam, in order to measure the structural and magnetic reflections at the same position. The 3 rd sample was not patterned. The magnetic properties of the patterned samples were found to be identical to those of the continuous film. It turned out that we did not have time to measure the 4-µm diameter dots during the beamtime. Hence only the continuous thin film and the 2-µm diameter dots were measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental set-up</head><p>The samples were glued (one at the time) at the top of a quartz capilary, itself mounted on the piezo stage of the diffractometer.</p><p>A Nitrogen stream was used to cool the samples (the magnetic phase of interest exists in the 89 K -179 K range for bulk Dysprosium). The controler of the cryostream was not interfaced with the beamline control software, preventing from scanning the temperature. Measurements at several temperatures were done by manual adjustments.</p><p>The incident X-ray beam was tuned to the Dy L3 edge (7.79 keV), which enhances the magnetic scattering of Dy atoms. The beam was focused to a 300 nm x 300 nm spot with Compound Refractive Lenses (CRLs), delivering 8.10¹ ph/s. ⁰ Figure 2: View of the sample on its capillary, with the nose of the cryostream. The incident beam aperture is visible behind.</p><p>In collaboration with ID01 staff, we installed a polarisation analyser on the detector arm, with the Maxipix mounted at the exit of the analyser, in order to measure 2D diffraction patterns. The incident beam had the natural linear horizontal polarisation of the undulator, the sample was oriented to scatter in vertical geometry and the polarisation analyser in horizontal geometry, such that we rejected most of the photons with unrotated polarisation. The polarisation analysis was performed with the (333) reflection of a germanium single crystal borrowed from BM28 (XMaS, UK CRG beamline). At the Dy L3 edge, the bragg angle of the Ge (333) reflection is 47°, hence transmitting only 7% of the intensity with unrotated polarisation. Ge was preferred over graphite, whose (006) reflection provides a better rejection at the Dy L3 edge, because the high mosaicity of the graphite would distort the transmitted diffraction pattern, while the high crystalline quality of Ge minimizes such distortion.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental results: continuous Dy film</head><p>The rocking curve of the (002) reflection of the Dy film yields 1.10 cts/s at the peak (without the analyser, ⁸ integrated on the Maxipix), with FWHM 0.23°. The speckles denote the structural defects of the Dy film.</p><p>Similarly to the measurements on the direct beam, only a vertical slice of the speckle pattern is visible when measured with the analyser, and an integration over the analyser angle must be done. By compairing vertical slices of speckles with and without the analyser, we can estimate the efficiency of the analyser at ~20%, with no loss of speckle visibility (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Bulk Dysprosium host a helical antiferromagnetic order between 89 K and 179 K, whose periodicity is incommensurate with the crystal lattice and varies with temperature. Even at the Dy L3 edge, where magnetic scattering is strongly enhanced, the magnetic satellite reflections (0,0,L+/-τ) are hidden in the tails of the Bragg reflections. They can be however measured with the polarisation analyser, which rejects most of the Thomson scattering while retaining the magnetic scattering.  We tried to record speckle patterns of the Dy(002) and Dy (0,0,2-tau) at the same position on the continuous film, but there is no way to know by how much the beam drifted between both angular positions. Nevertheless,  a general idea of the speckle pattern was obtained. For each reflection, 2 orthogonal slices of the reciprocal space were measured by scanning successively the analyser angle and the sample rocking angle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results on patterned samples</head><p>We measured the sample with patterned dots of diameter 2 µm (see optical microscopy in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The ID01 in situ optical microscope, combined with fast scanning diffraction maps, allows to find a particular dot that had been chosen from SEM images. In addition, the patterned sample allows to precisely position the sample and the beam at the centre of rotation of the diffractometer. The diffraction patterns measured at the Dy (002) reflection of the dots were highly speckled, similarly to the ones of the continuous film (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>). This speckled structure indicates the presence of many structural defects in the dots. Unfortunately, there was some drift between beam and sample, possibly because of the cryostream, andwe were not able to stay reliably on one dot to align the polariser and look for a magnetic reflection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>On the positive side, our polarisation analyser was used for the first time to extract the rotated polarisation and allowed to measure the magnetic reflection from the continuous film, and to measure its speckle pattern by integrating a scan of its rocking angle. The Ge crystal used for polarisation analysis was of sufficiently good quality to avoid strong distortion of the speckle pattern. This is however quite inefficient, as each pixel column of the detector is measured at a different position of the analyser angle. It would be interesting to use a bent crystal instead of the flat one, in order to integrate the diffraction pattern in a single snapshot. For this, the radius of curvature would need to be D*sqrt(2), where D is the sample-to-analyser distance.</p><p>Let us note that, to our knowledge, the speckle patterns recorded at the magnetic reflections are he highest energy measurements of pure magnetis speckles. Previously, the higest energy reported for such measurements was the Uranium M4 edge (3.7 keV), in compounds like UO2, UAs, USb, and UGa3, by some of us. This improvement has been made possible by the EBS.</p><p>The magnetic reflection was found to behave like in the bulk, with similar temperature dependence (a quantitative comparison remains to be done).</p><p>We were also able to find pre-selected dots and measure their speckle patterns at the Dy (002) reflection.</p><p>On the negative side, beam/sample drift prevented us from measuring the magnetic reflection from the dots. It is probably due to the cryostream, although we did not have time to investigate the issue. For future measurements, a different cooling system could be tried.</p><p>Without measurements of the magnetic speckle pattern from individual dots, the initial goal of the proposal could not be done. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Optical microscopy images of the patterned samples (left: 4-µm diameter, right: 2-µm diameter)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,33.95,42.90,266.45,199.55" type="bitmap" /></figure>
