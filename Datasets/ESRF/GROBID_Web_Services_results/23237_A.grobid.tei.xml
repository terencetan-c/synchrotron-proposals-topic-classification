<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Using data collected at the ESRF, we have determined the structures of two members of the Lrp/AsnC family of transcription regulatory DNA-binding proteins. The Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins is found in both archaea and bacteria. Members of the family have been shown to influence cellular metabolism in both a global (Lrp) and specific (AsnC) manner in response to exogenous amino acid effectors. E.coli Lrp regulates numerous operons encompassing a variety of processes such as transport, degradation and pili formation in pathogenic bacteria. The first structure determination was of the family archetype E.coli AsnC with bound asparagine. The asparagine acts as an effector molecule to modulate positively or negatively the gene regulatory activity of AsnC. Structure determination required a full MAD data collection on E.coli AsnC because molecular replacement efforts at the time using our previously determined structure of P.furiosus LrpA had been unsuccessful. Data was collected on a selenomethionine-incorporated form of the protein to a resolution of 3Å and the substructure solved using SHELXD. Selenium sites were refined and phases calculated using SHARP and a model fitted to the resulting map. Subsequently a 2.4Å data set was collected on a second crystal form and the model from the MAD phased maps used for successful molecular replacement with MOLREP, making this the highest resolution structure on a family member to date. The second structure determination was of B. subtilis LrpC, an unusual bacterial DNA architectural protein, which constrains positive supercoils in the DNA in addition to its gene regulatory role. Data was collected on this protein also to a resolution of 2.4Å and used for molecular replacement with the structure of P.furiosus LrpA as the search model. Our asparagine-bound structure of AsnC is the first example of a family member with its effector clearly bound. The structure reveals AsnC to be an octameric disc, similar to that observed by us for P.furiosus LrpA. It identifies key residues involved in both ligand recognition and oligomer formation. The LrpC structure also reveals a stable octameric structure that is supportive of a topological role in DNA packaging. Taken together these structures confirm the Lrp/AsnC family's oligomerization states, the probable mode of action of the effector molecules and the basis of DNA binding. A manuscript is in preparation describing the details of both these structures and how they correlate with biochemical and genetic data.</p></div>
