<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Thirdly, we found significant background from the fiber optics of the FReLoN detector as well as image distortions from the CCD camera of the detector. Because our study focuses on subtle effects in the diffraction images corresponding to intensity fluctuations on the order of a few percent or lower, the detector background and distortions made it impossible to reliably extract the desired information. Neither we nor the beamline staff were aware of these problems before the beamtime, because the detector had normally been used for simple XRD characterization with nano-focusing which was not sensitive to these detector issues. Since the FReLoN camera was the only 2D detector available for the proposed experiment, the original goal to extract orientational order could not be achieved.</p><p>Nonetheless, we discovered some intriguing orientational properties of the sample. Shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are four diffraction patterns corresponding to different positions on the same sample, each divided by the average over the entire scan (7749 patterns). Large anisotropies around the azimuthal angle can be clearly observed in the diffraction ring, and the exact pattern varies with the position on the sample. We have corrected for some of the background and distortion mentioned above, and the remaining effects should be well below the ±10% anisotropy level observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, so we believe these effects originate from the sample. Notably, no change is observed in the position of the structure factor maximum as a function of the azimuthal angle, so the anisotropy cannot be explained by strain effects. Thus, the results suggest the existence of structural ordering beyond the pair distribution function.</p><p>Such high levels of anisotropy were quite unexpected. Because the sample was ~5μm thick, the illuminated volume for each pattern was on the order of 50nm × 50nm × 5μm. If there is only short-range (&lt; 2nm) structural ordering in the metallic glass as commonly believed, there will be approximately 1.6×10 6 correlated volumes that are illuminated, which means the anisotropy (arising from number fluctuations) should be on the order of (1.6×10 6 ) -1/2 = 8×10 -4 , much less than the 10% we observe. Therefore, there must be medium-to longrange structural ordering present in the amorphous sample, presenting a challenge to generally accepted theories on the structure of glasses.</p><p>However, because of the aforementioned limit on the X-ray energy, we were only able to examine this particular sample, so we could not determine whether these effects were sample-specific or universal among these glasses. Therefore, another experiment is necessary to evaluate the universality of the phenomenon described above and its scientific value. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Anisotropy in vapor-deposited PdCuSi glass measured at ID16B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Firstly, the K-B focusing mirrors had mechanical problems which limited the X-ray energy to 18.5 keV and above. This is above the Zr K-edge (18.0 keV) and makes it impractical to measure our main sample-Zrbased bulk metallic glasses. Therefore, we resorted to the backup sample-a PdCuSi metallic glass.</p><p>Secondly, there appeared to be a large background from air scattering, partly due to the fact that &gt;18 keV Xrays could easily penetrate the plastic sample mount. We tried to minimize this background using lead tape. This reduced the background significantly, but some still remained. Because this background changed with sample position, it significantly complicated the data analysis.</p></div>
