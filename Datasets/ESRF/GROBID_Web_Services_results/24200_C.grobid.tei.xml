<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Charge-density-wave (CDW) systems such as the blue bronze (K 0.3 MoO 3 ), KCP or NbSe 3 undergo Peierlstransitions into modulated states at low temperature. This transition is driven by an instability of the quasione-dimensional conduction-electron density leading to an electron-density-as well as a lattice-modulation with a wave vector of 2k F (k F is the Fermi wave vector). Inelastic neutron scattering studies on K 0.3 MoO 3 (J.P. <ref type="bibr">Pouget et al, PRB 43 (1991)</ref> 8421) and KCP <ref type="bibr">(K.Carneiro et al., PRB 13 (1976)</ref> 4258) have revealed an extremely steep phonon softening, the Kohn anomaly, of a low-energy phonon branch at the modulation wave vector, precursor to the phase transition, in agreement with theoretical expectations. However, inelastic X-ray scattering experiments carried out on NbSe 3 so far, did not show any sign of phonon softening upon cooling towards the Peierls transition <ref type="bibr">(H.Requardt et al., PRB 66 (2002)</ref> 4303), as well as they did not present splitting of a phonon branch into distinct CDW-phase and -amplitude excitations below the Peierls-transition temperature, as it has been observed in K 0.3 MoO 3 (J.P. <ref type="bibr">Pouget et al, PRB 43 (1991</ref><ref type="bibr">) 8421, B.Hennion et al., PRL 68 (1992</ref><ref type="bibr">) 2374)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this experiment was to extend the available phonon dispersion data to develop a basis for a more detailed understanding of the dynamics and its detailed features in the CDW-system NbSe 3 .</p><p>The measurements were carried out at the ID28 inelastic X-ray scattering instrument at an incident photon energy of 17794eV (Si999 backscattering monochromator reflection, energy resolution: 3meV) on a sample of thickness 3µm and dimensions 200µm x 3mm (V x H) transverse to the X-ray beam. During most of the data collection the sample was mounted to have the (H, K, H)-plane in the horizontal scattering plane. The orientation (0, K, L) was tested but found poluted by intense phonon signal coming from the sample holder. Low-energy phonon dispersion data was taken at room temperature in the (4, 0, 4)-Brillouin-zone along the propagation directions (H, 0, H), i.e. longitudinally polarized, and (0, K, 0), i.e. transversally polarized.</p><p>Phonons of mainly transverse polarization were recorded as well along the (0.5, K, 0.5) Brillouin-zone boundary. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents two inelastic spectra taken at Q=(4, 0.15, 4) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) and Q=(4.53, 0.17, 4.53) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) showing the Stokes-and Antistokes-lines of the acoustic and, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, also a low-energy optic phonon excitation. The lines represent fits by damped-harmonic oscillator profiles to the data. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows dispersion curves of longitudinally (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and transversally (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>) polarized phonon excitations. In the spectra taken closer to the Brillouin-zone centre than (0.1, 0, 0.1), Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, or (0, 0.1, 0), Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, the phonon peaks were too strongly merged into the intense elastic line to be separated by the fits. The transverse acoustic branch shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref> could not be followed beyond ∆K=0.3 due to the strongly decreasing intensitity of the phonon signal which had already vanished to below the background level at ∆K=0.4. Furthermore, it is interesting to note the very low excitation energy over the complete Brillouin-zone of the longitudinal acoustic phonon branch along (H, 0, H), Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, a branch which corresponds to vibrations of entire NbSe 3 -chains with respect to each other. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: NbSe 3 -phonon dispersion curves with polarization principally along the (H, 0, H)-direction. The data was taken at room temperature in the (4, 0, 4)-Brillouin-zone: a) longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch, b) transverse acoustic (TA) branch propagating along the direction (0, K, 0) (quasi-one-dimensional direction). c) Dispersion of transversally polarized acoustic (TA) and low-energy optic (TO) phonon branches at the Brillouin-zone boundary along (0.5, K, 0.5). The dotted lines are guides to the eye.</p><p>0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 2 4 6 8 10 a) phonon energy [meV] (∆H, 0, ∆H) [rlu] LA 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 2 4 6 8 10 b) phonon energy [meV] (0, ∆K, 0) [rlu] TA 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 c) phonon energy [meV] (0.5, ∆K, 0.5) [rlu] TA TO -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 0 10 20 30 40 50 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15 0 10 20 30 40 (4, 0.15, 4) a) intensity [cts/230sec] energy [meV] (4.53, 0.17, 4.53) b) intensity [cts/230sec] energy [meV]</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: NbSe 3 -phonon spectra (Stokes-and Antistokes-lines) taken at room temperature.
