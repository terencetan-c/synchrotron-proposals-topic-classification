<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Dental enamel is the most highly mineralised and strongest biological hard tissue. It comprises 95% hydroxyapatite (HA) mineral, 5% water, and 1% organic matter (non-collegenous protein). The hydroxyapatite crystal structure of dental enamel has been determined previously by several workers. HA has space group P6 3 /m with lattice parameters a=9.513Å and c=6.943Å. In all previous reports, the measurements were made on powdered enamel collected from many teeth, therefore any texture information regarding the growth of the HA crystallites was lost. This information however is extremely valuable in the understanding of the formation of enamel, and in improved design of dental composites for restorations. Our recent experiment on XMaS for the first time maps the change in preferred orientation as a function of position in an intact section of tooth. We used the MAR ccd area detector and the travelling sample platform to collect diffraction images every 50-300µm from various sections of teeth ~500µm in thickness. Over the four days we collected diffraction images from healthy teeth, lesionous teeth, teeth from high fluoride water areas and teeth with genetic defects (amelogenesis imperfecta).</p><p>An example of a 2-D map is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>The regions of highly crystalline enamel and poorly crystalline dentine are clearly visible. Additionally, it can be seen that below the groove between the two tooth cusps (the fissure), there is a circular region of enamel which is less crystalline than the surrounding structure. We believe this to be caused by a fissure lesion in the enamel which has affected the crystalline structure of the enamel. This type of lesion is undetectable by inspection of a whole tooth that has not been sectioned.</p><p>Diffraction patterns generated using fit2D from images b) and d) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Two orthogonal peaks 002 and 310 are marked in order to compare their peak intensities. In polycrystalline HA the value of the ratio of 002/310 should be between 2-3. In this highly textured enamel, the value of 002/310 varies enormously between 0.14(3) for Fig 2 <ref type="figure">ii</ref>) and 92.6(1) for Fig 2 <ref type="figure">iii</ref>). We are currently using Rietveld refinement of each diffraction pattern with texture and strain parameters included to produce complete 2-D texture and strain contour maps of tooth enamel. Preliminary results suggest that the strongest preferred orientation was found along the 002 direction. Cuspal areas of high crystallite alignment match the expected occlusal surfaces of the teeth. Within individual teeth different cusps had quite different intrinsic strain profiles, which would agree with previously published theoretical calculations where independent cuspal movement was described. Such results reveal new information on the texture and strain profiles within teeth which may have potential in the future to optimise dental composite materials for restorations.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): M.
