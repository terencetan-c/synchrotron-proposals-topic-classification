<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>(configurational entropy) naturally raises local atomic distortion, thus, the energy barrier for atomic diffusion (sluggish diffusion effect), leading to slower dynamics. But our XPCS results of Zr20Nb20Cu20Ni20Ti20, shown in right plane of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, reveal that the relaxation behavior of the disordered state (high configurational entropy) is significantly faster than that of the ordered state (low configurational entropy). Moreover, to get quantitative information of the relaxation process, the time average intensity autocorrelation functions, 𝑔2(𝑞,𝑡) are calculated, shown in left plane of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, by averaging each TTCF along the tw axis. In order to get the relaxation time and shape parameters, we use a modulated Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) model function: 𝑔2(𝑞,𝑡) = 1 + 𝑎 + 𝑐[exp(-2(𝑡/𝜏) 𝛽 )] to fit the 𝑔2 (𝑞,𝑡) functions. However, through the comparison of 𝑔2(𝑞,0) (the value of 𝑔2(𝑞,𝑡) when t=0, parameter regarded as a reflection of the strength of β relaxation), we found that the β relaxation of the disordered state is significantly stronger than that of the ordered state.</p><p>Our preliminary findings have led us to realize that the impact of the high-entropy effect on the dynamics of MGs is more complex than a simply expectation of sluggish diffusion, and its impact on glasses is more intricate than anticipated before. Furthermore, conventional techniques relying on the relaxation of macroscopic physical parameters are inadequate in accurately reflecting the effect of high-entropy at the atomic structural level in MGs. Therefore, we need more time to conduct a further XPCS experiment to systematically investigate these abnormal dynamic behaviors of the HEMG systems from multiple aspects, such as q-dependence of steady relaxation and aging (at temperatures close to the glass transition temperature) behavior, dynamics feature change through the glass transition into supercooled liquid. These results will provide a more complete picture of the entropy effect on the dynamics of HEMGs and guide our future efforts to regulate dynamics in MGs by adjusting the configurational entropy.
