<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We aim to solve the crystal structure of protein effectors from Legionella pneumophila, a bacterial intracellular pathogen responsible for Legionnaire's disease. Those proteins are secreted into the eukaryotic host cell cytoplasm during the infection cycle, and interact with various protein targets to "hijack" the normal cellular processes in order for the bacteria to survive and replicate. Solving their structure will allow a better understanding of the molecular basis of the infection process. A native dataset was previously collected from crystals of one of those purified effector, an enzyme that catalyses dephosphorylation reactions. To solve the structure, we are now trying experimental phasing using selenomethionine protein and co-crystalization with heavy atoms.</p><p>The beamtime was used to screen selenomethionine protein crystals for structure solving (SAD), and for Mn2+ co-crystallization in the native protein crystal. A total of 6 crystals screened.</p><p>Crystals were not good enough for whole data collection, but allowed us to investigate better crystallization conditions.</p></div>
