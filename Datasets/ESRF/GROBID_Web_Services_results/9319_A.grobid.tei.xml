<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>According to the preparation procedure described in the application we have prepared transient intermediates, obtained 25 ns and 200 ns after the mixing of 57 Fe-enriched cytochrome P450,, (low-spin form) with m-CPBA. The reaction procuct (compound I) was freeze-quenched at -78°C in an isopentane cooling bath. The resulting frozen material was collected as "snow" (50 -lOOu1) and packed into sample holders which are appropriate for nuclear resonant forward scattering (NFS) experiments using Synchrotron radiation. Parallel to this procedure we have also prepared the compound I analog of 57 Fe-enriched irontetramesityl porphyrin (FeTMP; -50 111). After setting up the experiment (installation of cryostate and counters) we have performed an NFS experiment at 4.2K with the enzyme as-prepared (compound I). After several hours of measuring time we were unable to detect a quantum beat spectrum in single bunch mode. (Note that we have applied for 16 bunch mode). Therefore we have continued our experiment with the 57FeTMP compound I analog at 4.2K. Within -2h we were able to record a NFS spectrum which exhibits reasonable statistics up to -150 ns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Beyond this delay time the obtained statistics are not satisfactory within the experimental conditions available (5Opl sample volume, -2h measuring time, single bunch mode). Nevertheless, we were able to show that the experimental time spectrum between -20 and 150 ns exhibits remarklable similarities compared to the theoretical time spectrum which results from a simulation using the SYNFOS program package [l]. This simulation represents (parallel) spin coupling between the ferry1 iron (S=l) and the porphyrin cation radical (S = l/2), as expected for a compound I analog.</p><p>In summary we have shown with a compound I analog that the proposed experiment with the compound I enzyme is promising, however, we need 16 bunch mode (instead of single bunch II.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Angular Resolved Molecular Vibrations Studied by Nuclear Inelastic Scattering</head><p>Within the remaining beam time (3 shifts) we have investigated the time-integrated nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) intensity at energies from -lOOmeV to +lSOmeV arround the resonance energy EC of the 57 Fe Miissbauer transition in [CNsH&amp;[Fe(CN)sNO] at room temperature. Two different orientations of single crytals were investigated, i.e. c-axis and aaxis parallel to the Synchrotron beam. The obtained NIS spectra clearly indicate the presence of angular resolved molecular modes (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We are presently analyzing these modes on the basis of molecular orbital calculations in the local density approach. [l] M. Haas, E. Realo, H. Winler, W. Meyer-Klaucke, A.X. Trautwein, 0.
