<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p>Recently thermodynamic modelling predicted that contrary to the established consensus, hydrosulfide complexes may be the predominant form of base metals in many natural fluids at high temperatures. This project aimed to test this hypothesis by determining the molecular structure, stability constants, and competition among Pb(II) chloro-and hydrosulfide-complexes at T up to 500C, 800 bar.</p><p>A secondary aim was to to collect some data on the Pb-Cl and Pb-Br systems to complement the transmission only experiment conducted in Australia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Data were collected at the Pb L 3 -edge (13035 eV) at the BM-30B (FAME) beamline, using the high T-P autoclave developed by the Institut Neel. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General observations/preliminary fits</head><p>1. Sol3: PbS in 1 m NaHS -an intriguing "bump"/tiny step was observed at 300 o C, an actual step at 400 o C which decreased with time, indicating that the solubility of PbS could be higher than that previously expected. However given the noise in the spectra it was not out if the realm of possibility that the PbS solid that had been loaded into the cell was floating in the beam. The evidence while intrigung was not convincing.</p><p>2. Sol7: PbS in 1 m NaHS + added S(s) -to decrease the pH of the solution, a piece of S was added. For this system a surprisingly large edge step was obtained. However, the spectrum varied suspicously little with time or temperature. The last time we had such an unusal result it transpired that we must have been measuring the solid (and when we tried to repeat that experiment the results were radically different). Given the lack of variability of the spectra with temperature, the data are suspicious and not convincing. 3. Preliminary fits indicate that Pb(II) has a low coordination number in salty solutions (&lt; ~1 m salt). EXAFS fitting struggles to decide between a total of 3 or 4 ligands total at low temperatures (eg 30-100 o C). Some quick ADF calculations suggest that the structure is happier with 3 ligands. NB for higher temperatures (~500 o C) the coordination number seems to decrease even more. 4. Preliminary fits indicate that Pb(II) has a higher coordination number in more "watery" solutions (ie 0.1 m HBr), that drops with increasing temperature. This higher coordination number is more noticable (and higher) for Br-bearing solutions than for Cl. 5. Preliminary fits indicate that under the conditions measured, Pb(II) is never fully clorinated, there is always some O present. And conversely, even under rather low Br concentrations (0.1 m HBr) (and Cl?), there is evidence of Br being coordinated at low temperatures.  </p></div>
