<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SC-5009 was performed on the nanobranch of ID13 with a beamsize of (300x300) nm² at an energy of 15.2 keV with exposure times between 0.1 s and 1 s per point. The original intend of the proposal to perform XRF/XRD tomography was changed to 2D mapping due to travel restrictions for better feasibility of the remote experiment. This did not compromise the quality of the data obtained and the insights gained into the system investigated. Generally, during the day shorter measurements with several sample changes were conducted and over night long macros for multi-ROI mapping were launched to ensure optimal use of the time available.</p><p>The aim of the project was to unravel the distribution of Br/Zn and the chitin/protein organization in the Limulus polyphemus cornea on the micron and sub-micron scale. This we achieved for smaller maps with a high resolution mesh (300x500) nm² and larger maps with a coarser mesh (1x1) µm² both for multiple longitudinal and cross sections from different animals. The simultaneous detection of XRD and XRF data ensured highquality correlative data for structure and composition of the samples investigated. It was possible to measure all planned samples and a few additional ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To study the interaction of chitin and proteins, references of intact and deproteinized L.p. tendons were measured. These show a clear shift especially of the (020) chitin reflection to lower q values when proteins are present (see also <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>). The same effect is also observed in the L.p. cornea sections, indicating co-ordering of chitin and proteins therein. Preliminary analysis of the chitin packing peak at around 1 nm -1 suggests that the chitin/protein ratio decreases towards the center of the corneal cones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>) which is supported by lowered intensity of the (020) intensity when fixed to 6.67 nm -1 (position in pure chitin, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). The intensity variation of the chitin packing peak peak is caused by the orientation of chitin fibers given by its helicoidal plywood architecture leading to a lamellate pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). A higher intensity indicates chitin fibers being oriented in the direction of the beam. The packing peak is not present in the outer layer of the corneal cones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>), whereas Zn is, as can be seen in the XRF maps (Fig 1C , <ref type="figure">green)</ref>. The high-resolution maps of selected regions give a more detailed insight into the structure and composition of the L.p. cornea, however, the general trends seem to be the same. Just as for the large maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), the bromine distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) is inversely correlated with the q position of the chitin packing peak (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). A more detailed evaluation of these and other datasets (e.g. maps of cross sections) is still pending.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: High resolution (300 nm x 500 nm mesh) map of the outer cornea protrusion, correlation of the chitin fiber center-to-center packing peak q position, Intensity and Br map. (A) A higher q value shows a higher chitin/protein ratio (B) The high intensity lines show lamellae with chitin fibers oriented normal to the image surface. (C) The Br map shows more Br in regions where the chitin fiber packing peak is shifted to lower q values.</p><p>Due to the great number of individual diffraction patterns per dataset, the data analysis procedure is yet to be optimized. The data analysis pipeline is currently as follows: Reduction of 2D diffraction patterns to 1D q vs I profiles in dpdak <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. After exporting these, the background profile is created with a python script by averaging multiple profiles of SiN membrane/air, normalized over the primary beam. Then, in a second scipt the whole dataset profiles are normalized by the primary beam and corrected by the previously created background. The resulting profiles are exported in a format that can be read by dpdak for peak fitting.</p><p>Additionally, we were able to sucessfully perform test measurements on spider tactile hairs of Cupiennius salei, to assess the signal to noise ratio and identify putatively interesting elements present for future experiments.</p><p>[1] Sviben, S. et al</p><p>., Epidermal Cell Surface Structure and Chitin-Protein Co-assembly Determine Fiber Architecture in the Locust Cuticle.
