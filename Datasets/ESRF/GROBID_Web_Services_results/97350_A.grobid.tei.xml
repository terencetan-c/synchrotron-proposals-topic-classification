<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the spectroscopy part of this proposal was to determine the oxidation state of lanthanum in the novel LaN2 phase by XANES to check the preliminary conclusion of unusual La 2+ oxidation state made from crystal-chemistry analysis of LaN2 structure.</p><p>All sample preparation was done at our home laboratory in Bayreuth. The planned preparation of diamond anvil cell (DAC) with special purchased mini-diamonds for XANES measurements (thickness of 0.5 mm) was not successful (diamonds broke during the nitrogen gas-loading). Hence, DAC equipped with standard diamonds (thickness of 1.5 mm) composed of LaN2 sample at 25 GPa, which was studied before at X-ray diffraction beamline was used to investigate LaN2 sample. Usually, such thick diamonds do not allow to measure La LIII-edge due to the low transmission of the diamond at such energies. Therefore, backup DAC#2 was prepared containing laser-heated Yb piece embedded in molecular nitrogen at 50 GPa. The DAC#2 was previously studied at X-ray diffraction beamline, where a mixture of two new Yb-N phases with unique N8 nitrogen units and N6 rings respectively were found. Ytterbium could possess two typical Yb 2+ and Yb 3+ oxidation states, that's why this sample is also an interesting case for XANES spectroscopy. A grand total of two diamond anvil cells and three reference samples (La2O3, Yb2O3 powders and Yb metal piece) were brought to ID12 beamline. After setting up the ID12 beamline and many attempts to optimize it for lanthanum XANES highpressure measurements we managed to get-though weak-the La LII-edge XANES signal from LaN2 sample in the DAC. The comparison of the collected spectrum with La2O3 reference sample spectrum revealed the oxidation state of +3 for lanthanum in LaN2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). This result refutes the hypothesis about the unusual La 2+ oxidation state and shows that instead the nitrogen species should have unusual charge states in the LaN2 structure. We had enough time to study backup DAC#2 cell with Yb-N sample. As long as Yb LII,III absorption edge energies are higher than La LII,III edge energies the diamond transmission is higher which results in the much better quality of high-pressure XANES signal. The analysis of Yb LIII edge XANES spectra of Yb-N sample at 50 GPa, Yb (Yb 2+ spectroscopy standard) and Yb2O3 (Yb 3+ spectroscopy standard) reference samples clearly demonstrated that both Yb-N phases contain only Yb 3+ . This result will help to shed the light on the charge state of exotic N8 and N6 nitrogen units.</p><p>The results of this beamtime together with previously obtained X-ray diffraction data should result in two scientific publications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure. 1. a) La LII edge XANES spectra of LaN2 sample at 25 GPa and La2O3 reference sample at ambient conditions. b) Yb LIII edge XANES spectra of "Yb-N" sample at 50 GPa and Yb and Yb2O3 reference samples at ambient conditions.</figDesc></figure>
