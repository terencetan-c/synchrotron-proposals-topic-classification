<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Growth dynamics of organic thin films of Phthalocyanines using simultaneous real-time diffuse and specular scattering: Determination of the Ehrlich-Schwoebelbarrier Please note: Since the main proposer, Dr. Rupak Banerjee, was, due to personal reasons, unfortunately not able to attend the beamtime himself, we had to adjust the exerimental program in order to guarantee the success of the experiment. Unfortunately, we were not able to replace Dr. Banerjee's expertise in the field of diffuse scattering and phthalocyanines so that materials related, but slightly different from that originally proposed, were employed. The experiment was very successful as reported in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview:</head><p>Mixtures of small organic semiconductors are interesting for the use in devices, such as organic photovoltaic cells. For these kinds of devices the crystal structure and the orientation of the individual molecules are of great importance for their efficiency. In the experiment SC-3762 we investigated mixtures of diindenoperylene (DIP) and C 60 buckminster fullerene. Films were prepared in a portable ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber and investigated via real-time in situ X-ray scattering methods. The film growth was controlled precisely via home-build Knudsen cells, a quartz-crystal-microbalance and a sophisticated substrate temperature regulation. A beryllium window in the UHV chamber allowed us to trace the progress of the film growth without any exposure of the samples to ambient conditions.</p><p>We investigated a wide growth parameter space during the experiments performed. Mixtures with three different DIP:C 60 ratios were prepared: 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3. For each of these mixing ratios three different substrate temperatures (303 K, 343 K, 373 K) were used. For all of these, the total growth rate was chosen to be 0.2 nm/min. So in total, we were able to prepare nine different films within the allocated twelve shifts. The film growth was followed via grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) scans using a PILATUS II detector. For all samples, we performed detailed post-growth measurements including wide-range, highresolution GIXD, X-ray reflectivity (XRR) scans with corresponding diffuse and rocking scans. Furthermore, we mapped the reciprocal space using the PILATUS detector and checked for beam-damage on the films by repeating selected measurements at different spots of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of the measurements and the data:</head><p>A reliable beam and no technical problems with the equipment allowed us to measure all samples uninterruptedly. In order to follow the growth in real-time we selected a compromise between time resolution, spatial resolution and examined q-range of the scans. This resulted in a timeresolution of 150 seconds. Since the total growth time of one sample was approximately 100 minutes, a detailed timeresolved study of the film growth could be followed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and progress of the evaluation:</head><p>The measurements of the different samples were compared to each other. The datasets were background-corrected and converted to reciprocal space (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The reflectivity data were fitted using Parratt's formalism. Furthermore, the observed Bragg reflections were related to known crystal structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results:</head><p>In general, we saw interesting influences of the substrate temperature on the film growth. The top surface roughness increases with increasing substrate temperature. On the other hand, the crystallinity (in-plane and out-of-plane) improves with increasing substrate temperature. The influence of the mixing ratio can be summarized as follows: Having an excess of one material leads usually to smoother films. Furthermore, films with more DIP exhibit a better out-of-plane crystallinity of the DIP domains as well as of the C 60 domains. For the in-plane structure, usually the excess material shows a higher coherent crystallite size.</p><p>We want to thank the ESRF for granting us beamtime and our local contact for his excellent support and his help. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Christopher Lorch*, Simon Weimer*, Johannes Dieterle*, Dr. Alexander Gerlach*, Dr. Rupak Banerjee, Prof. Frank Schreiber all Universt채t T체bingen, Institut f체r Angewandte Physik, Auf der Morgenstelle 10, D-72076 T체bingen, Germany Report:</figDesc></figure>
