<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to perform reflectometry and grazing incidence diffraction (GID) experiments from phase separated di-and tri-block copolymers deposited onto silicon substrates. As we have not previously performed such experiments on BM28 there was also an element of determining the appropriate conditions for such measurements with a view to doing more experiments in the future. We measured both grafted and non-grafted films of polyalkylmethacrylate-polystyrene diblock copolymers and a polystyrenepolybutadiene-polystyrene (PS-PB-PS) triblock copolymer (from BASF). The triblock copolymer was also measured as a compression moulded film (courtesy Joanna Stasiak and Geoff Moggridge from Chemical Engineering, University of Cambridge as part of an EPSRC funded project).</p><p>The GID experiments were performed using a circular MAR detector and a sample result is given in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As can be seen from this image it wsa found that it is possible to resolve several diffraction features in these samples -in this particular case a hexagonal lattice is present. Although this measurement was performed in a manner which selectively probes the surface of the mould sample, such hexagonal ordering is consistent with the expected formation of cylinders of PS in a PB matrix.</p><p>Although not all of the samples yielded observable diffraction features it is clear that certain samples display the laterally phase separated structures that we anticipated we would see when we applied for this beamtime.</p><p>Along with the GID measurements reflectometry profiles were also collected. Currently we are modelling these profiles and so cannot 1.E-09</p><p>1.E-08</p><p>1.E-07</p><p>1.E-06</p><p>1.E-05</p><p>1.E-04</p><p>1.E-03</p><p>1.E-02</p><p>1.E-01</p><p>1.E+00</p><p>1.E+01 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 Q / Ã… -1 Normalized Intensity</p><p>give specific results for them. However from an initial analysis of the Kiesig fringes it has been possible to determine the film thickness of many of the sampsles (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Ultimately it is hoped that the reflectometry models will be able to illucidate the composition profile of the films normal to the surface. The information from the reflectometry and GID measured would then be combined with complementary results from atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry mearurements to generate a consistent set of results for publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1 -GID of PS-PB-PS triblock copolymer as a moulded film</figDesc></figure>
