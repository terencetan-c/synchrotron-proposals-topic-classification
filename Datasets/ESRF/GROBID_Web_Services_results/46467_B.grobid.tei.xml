<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Rationale: MD438 and MD531 beamtime allocations allowed us to investigate the effects of synchrotron-generated interlaced MRT coupled to pink-beam imaging on the GAERS rat. Since recent data had shown that absence seizures arise within the somatosensory cortex before they diffuse to the rest of the cortex and the thalamus, we irradiated this cortical region bilaterally using 4 interlaced ports of 50µm-wide microbeams resulting in a homogenous dose of 200Gy into the targeted areas. This procedure resulted in a 50% reduction of the seizure duration compared to sham animals that appeared as soon as 3 weeks after irradiation and was still significant after five months. Histological and electrophysiological data suggest that this effect is not mediated through simple tissue necrosis, but probably via a disruption of the local cellular network, which prevents the neurons from hypersynchronizing and generating epileptic discharges, without impairing their ability to perform their physiological tasks. This non-destructive effect of MRT becomes extremely suitable when seizures originate from a brain structure with a critical role like the hippocampus -the structure most commonly involved in pharmacoresistant MTLE. In order to address the applicability of MRT on MTLE, we propose to investigate its effects on a predictive and drug-resistant model obtained after intrahippocampal injection of kainate in the mouse. This mouse model was preferred to the one developed in the rat because of the stability and recurrence of the seizures over a long time period, (ii) the resistance to several anti-epileptic drugs and because (iii) intracellular recordings were recently collected by our group in this model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>-Timeline -Experimental groups:</p><p>Irradiated kainate mice 50Gy n=5 Irradiated kainate mice 100Gy n=5 Irradiated kainate mice 200Gy n=4 Irradiated kainate mice 400Gy n=2 Irradiated kainate mice 800Gy n=1 Control kainate mice 0Gy n=6</p><p>Results:</p><p>-Kainate injection One of the two cannulas used for intra-hippocampal injections of kainate was occluded.</p><p>As a result some of the mice did not become epileptic.</p><p>The mossy fiber sprouting induced by the kainate injection was visible on the T2 anatomical MRIs performed before irradiations. All mice showing no hippocampal sclerosis were excluded from the results.</p><p>-T2 anatomical MRI &gt;&gt;&gt; Mice which indeed received kainate in their hippocampus show a clear hypersignal within the right hippocampus. Right hippocampus appears bigger, as a result of the sclerosis.</p><p>List of mice with sclerosis: 0Gy: SK17, SK15, SK28, SK16 (n=4) 50Gy: SK34, SK31, SK13, SK33 (n=4) 100Gy: SK12, SK20, SK14, SK19, SK25 (n=5) 200Gy: SK24 (n=1) 400Gy: (n=0) 800Gy: (n=0)</p><p>-Irradiation: we modified the size of the microbeam for the different ports in order to better fit the shape of the dorsal hippocampus. ` However, the posterio-ventral hippocampus (which did not receive the kainate injection) was not irradiated. Note that 2 animals irradiated at 800Gy died within 1h post-irradiation (not shown here).</p><p>-EEG Are included only the animals which showed a hippocampal sclerosis on the T2-MRI and the histology. Note that some animal lost their headstage connector between 2w and 4w postirradiation which explains the difference in the number of animals.</p><p>2 weeks post irradiation 4w post-irradiation -Histology: 0Gy: SK15 &gt;&gt;seizures 50Gy: SK34 &gt;&gt;seizures SK13 &gt;&gt; No seizures 100Gy: SK19 &gt;&gt;seizures SK12 &gt;&gt; No seizures Conclusions:</p><p>-An antiepileptic effect was obtained at 50Gy and above.</p><p>-At 50Gy no necrosis was visible on histlogical slices. However, a functional effect was quantifiable. Neuromodulation? -Despite the improvement in the conformation of the irradiation target, it is still difficult to target both the dorsal and the ventral hippocapus. -The antiepileptic effect appears to increase between 2 and 4w post irradiation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Jean Laissue* -Institute of Pathology Bern Tanguy Chabrol* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Antoine Depaulis* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Elke Brauer-Krisch* -ESRF Raphael Serduc* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Benoit Pouyatos* -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 François Estève -Grenoble Institut des Neurosciences, INSERM U836 Report:</figDesc></figure>
