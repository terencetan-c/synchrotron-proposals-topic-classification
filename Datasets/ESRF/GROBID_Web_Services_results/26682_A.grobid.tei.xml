<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A quite unexpected sevenfold coordination of the hydrated Hg(II) complex in aqueous solution is revealed by an extensive study combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and quantum mechanics/ molecular dynamics (QM/MD) calculations. As a matter of fact, the generally accepted octahedral solvation of Hg(II) ion cannot be reconciled with XAS results. Next, refined QM computations point out the remarkable stability of a heptacoordinated structure with C2 symmetry, and long-time MD simulations by new interaction potentials including many-body effects reveal that the hydrated complex has a quite flexible structure, corresponding for most of the time to heptacoordinated species. This picture is fully consistent with X-ray absorption near-edge structure experimental data which unambiguously show the preference for a sevenfold instead of a sixfold coordination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Mercury is a toxic and an environmentally hazardous element able to replace biological Zn(II) in enzymes, proteins, and nucleic acids, altering the normal activity of these species. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Once released to the environment by a variety of sources (e.g., waste combustors or coal-fired power plants), metallic mercury is oxidized to Hg(II) by water and ozone, and when it falls on the ground of acidic soil (around pH ) 4), it transforms to the neurotoxin methyl mercury that causes severe neurological damages (e.g., Minamata disease). <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref> Despite the calamitous effects on human health arising from mercury pollution of streams, lakes, and oceans, 4 the solution structure of aqua Hg-(II) ion is still poorly defined due to the lack of experimental techniques able to provide reliable information about the coordination structure of this ion. 5 Hg(II) is normally described as being hexacoordinated by water, <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> but due to the occurrence of hydrolysis and of different coordination geometries that mercury adopts in complexes, a conclusive description of the structural properties of this ion is still lacking. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Moreover, like Zn(II) and Cd(II), the d 10 Hg(II) ion has no electronic spectroscopic handle, and the few attempts made to study its hydration structure by X-ray diffraction are in support of retention of the same octahedral structure as present in the solidstate X-ray structure of Hg(ClO 4 ) 2 โ6H 2 O. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> However, the radial distribution function obtained from X-ray diffraction of Hg(II) in aqueous solution showed a broad peak corresponding to an unexpectedly large variation in the Hg-O bond lengths. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The wide bond distance distribution has been explained by a pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in the hexahydrated mercury(II) complexes leading to four equatorial Hg-O bonds about 0.05 ร shorter than the axial ones. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In addition, the residence time of water molecules in the first hydration shell of Hg(II) is quite short (of the order of nanoseconds) <ref type="bibr">8</ref> as compared with divalent first row transition ions which form octahedral hydration complexes in aqueous solution. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We have undertaken a combined experimental and theoretical investigation to unveil the detailed structure and dynamics of the hydrated Hg(II) ion complex in aqueous solution. We used a combined extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis to explore the Hg(II) hydration structure. Quantum mechanical ab initio calculations support the experimentally determined structural results, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the dynamic behavior of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>X-ray Absorption Measurements. A 0.1 M Hg(II) water solution was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of Hg(ClO4)2 in freshly distilled water and adding HClO4 in order to prevent hydrolysis. Hg LIII XAS spectra were obtained at the X-ray absorption spectrometer BM29 9 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Spectra were recorded in transmission mode using a Si(311) double-crystal monochromator detuned to 50%. Data points were collected for 1 s each, and three spectra were recorded and averaged. The solution was kept in a cell with Kapton film windows and Teflon spacers of 4 mm. XANES Data Analysis. The raw experimental data (see Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>) were deconvolved of the whole tabulated Hg LIII core hole width (ฮ ) 5.50 eV). <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> This treatment largely facilitates the detection of spectral features and the comparison with theoretical calculations. The XANES data analysis was carried out with the MXAN code. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The X-ray absorption cross section was calculated in the framework of the full multiple-scattering scheme within the muffintin approximation for the shape of the potential. The real part of the exchange term was calculated using the Hedin-Lundqvist energydependent potential, while the inelastic losses did not include the corehole lifetime broadening as it was previously eliminated from the experimental spectrum. A least-square fit of the experimental data in the space of the structural parameters was achieved using the MINUIT routine of the CERN library, 13 which minimizes the Rsq function defined as where n is the number of the independent structural parameters, m is the number of experimental points (88 for all the reported analyses), y i theor and y i expmtl are the theoretical and experimental values of the absorption cross section, and i was constant and equal to 0.5% of the experimental jump. The MIGRAD subroutine of the MINUIT package calculates the reported statistical errors. The resolution broadening was taken into account using a Gaussian function.</p><p>Quantum Mechanical Details. All the quantum mechanical computations have been carried out with the Gaussian 03 package. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> In view of previous experience, <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> we have selected the pseudo-relativistic LANL2 17 effective potential for mercury and optimized a corresponding valence basis set (describing 5d, 6s, and, possibly, 6p orbitals) including multiple f and g polarization functions (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), whereas H2O has been described by the cc-pVTZ basis set, augmented by diffuse s and p functions on the oxygen atoms taken from the aug-cc-pVTZ set. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Test computations performed on the Hg(II)-H2O system have shown that at this level the basis set superposition error (BSSE) is very low (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). Furthermore, the very reliable CCSD(T) (Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles with noniterative account of Triple excitations) approach <ref type="bibr">19</ref> and the less CPU demanding second order Moeller-Plesset (MP2) method 20 provide essentially equivalent results, while sizable differences are obtained from Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). All following computations have thus been performed at the MP2 level.</p><p>The potential energy surface (PES) of the Hg(II)-H2O system has been characterized by means of 1833 grid points with a tilt angle ฯ equal to 0ยฐ(ion-oxygen distances ranging from 1.2 to 4 ร and steps of 0.02 ร; ion-oxygen-hydrogen ฮธ angles ranging from 7.745ยฐto 127.745ยฐand steps of 10ยฐ), and 572 grid points with a tilt angle different from 0ยฐ(ฯ equal to 30ยฐ, 45ยฐ, 60ยฐ, 90ยฐ, and 135ยฐ; ion-oxygen distances ranging from 1.7 to 2.7 ร and steps of 0.1 ร; ion-oxygen-hydrogen ฮธ angles ranging from 7.745ยฐto 127.745ยฐand step of 10ยฐ). The initial 2405 grid points were reduced to 2163 by imposing a threshold of 4000 kJ mol -1 for the interaction energy, thus not including the most repulsive conformations in the PES.</p><p>After MP2 computations in vacuum, bulk solvent effects have been taken into account by means of the latest implementation of the socalled conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> The effective potential governing Hg(II)-H2O interactions including nonadditive effects by other solvent molecules can be expressed as <ref type="bibr">24</ref> where the wave function ฯ is perturbed by the solvent effect according to the CPCM, and the Hamiltonian operators H ห(0) refer to the Hg(II)-H2O, bare Hg(II) ion, and bare water molecule in a vacuum. At variance with previous studies <ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">26</ref> the energy has been computed at the MP2 level using the HF wave function polarized by the solvent reaction field. The optimization of the CPCM Hg(II) cavity radius has been performed along the line of the previously described procedure, <ref type="bibr">15</ref> giving rise to a cavity radius of 1.14 ร, while radii of 1.68 and 1.44 ร have been used with an R scaling factor of 0.965 for the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, respectively. Each sphere forming the solute cavity has been subdivided into finite elements (tesserae) with a constant average area of 0.05 ร 2 , without any charge compensation. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> (9) Filipponi, A.; Borowski, M.; Bowron, D.

The MD simulations have been carried out using the GROMACS package version 3.2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">27</ref> modified in order to include our Hg(II)-H2O effective two-body potential functions, by means of the following expression where r io, rih1, and rih2 are the ion-water distances; qi, qo, and qh are the electrostatic charges of mercury, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms, respectively (2, -0.8476 and 0.4238 au); and the Ao,...., Fo, Ah,....,Dh parameters are reported in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, for both the effective two body potential that accounts for many-body terms by means of PCM calculations and, for comparison, a pure pair additive potential, obtained by the in vacuum MP2 calculations.</p><p>A system including one Hg(II) ion and 819 SPC/E water molecules 28 has been simulated enforcing periodic boundary conditions in the NVT ensemble. A cutoff of 9 ร has been used for the nonbonded interactions, using the particle-mesh Ewald method to treat the long-range electrostatic interactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">30</ref> A homogeneous background charge was applied to compensate for the ionic charge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">31</ref> The temperature was kept fixed at 300 K by weak coupling to an external temperature bath using Berendsen's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">32</ref> with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. The simulation has been carried out for 65 ns, with a time step of 1 fs. The first 5 ns have been utilized to equilibrate the system and discarded in all the analyses. In order to test the stability of the heptacoordinated first hydration species, after 15 ns of unperturbed MD simulation, the final coordinates have been used to carry out six additional simulations of 2500 ps each, where the starting velocities have been randomly generated. After the starting perturbation, the heptacoordinated structure was restored in all of the simulations and it was the only observed first hydration shell species. A last MD simulation has been carried out with the Hg(II)-water pure pair additive potential, obtained by MP2 in vacuum calculations (eq 3 and Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) for 25 ns of simulation time. The trajectories of the last 20 ns have been saved every 25 ps for analyses.</p><p>The residence time ฯ of water molecules in the first coordination shell of Hg(II) has been estimated following the method of Impey and coauthors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">33</ref> According to this method it is possible to define for each water molecule a binary survival probability function Pj(t, tn, t*) that takes the value 1 if the water molecule j lies within the referred hydration shell at both time steps tn and t + tn and does not leave the coordination shell for any continuous period longer than t*. Otherwise, it takes the value 0. From Pj it is possible to define an average quantity nion(t) given by the expression where N t represents the total number of steps. At long times, nion(t) decays in an exponential fashion, with a characteristic correlation time ฯ which defines the residence time of the water molecule in the shell. We have chosen a t* value equal to the time interval between saved configurations (25 fs). A water molecule has been considered in the first hydration shell if the Hg(II)-oxygen distance was shorter than 3.8 ร.</p></div>

The coordination number of the Hg(II) hydration complex cannot be accurately determined from the EXAFS data analysis due to its large correlation with the Debye-Waller factor. However, the structural oscillations decrease very rapidly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), giving somehow larger Debye-Waller factors than expected for an octahedral coordination complex. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> The presence of a Hg-Hg interaction has been discarded as the Hg-Hg two body signal presents a high amplitude in the k-range between 6 and 10 ร -1 in contrast to the experimental data behavior. XANES is extremely sensitive to the geometric environment of the absorbing atom as multiple-scattering effects make large contributions to this region of the X-ray absorption spectra. A quantitative analysis of the XANES which includes the rising edge and about 200 eV above it can address some of the aforementioned shortcomings of EXAFS.</p><p>To examine the compatibility of the XANES spectrum with the existence of an octahedral geometry of the solvated Hg(II) ion, we performed a minimization of the experimental data imposing T h symmetry (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>). In this fit, only the Hg-(II)-water ligand distance was allowed to vary, resulting in a Hg-O best-fit distance of 2.29(3) ร and R sq ) 15.7 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). A second minimization has been carried out using an equatorially constrained Jahn-Teller distorted octahedron (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>). In this case the equatorial Hg-O distances obtained from the fit were equal to 2.24(3) ร, while the two axial distances were found at 2.41(3) ร, with an R sq ) 15.2 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Note that even if the agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectra is not satisfactory, the results of the fitting procedure point toward a structure with a very large difference (0.17 ร) between the equatorial and axial distances.</p><p>Finally, to assess the compatibility of the XANES with a more disordered hexacoordinated hydration complex, we performed an additional minimization of the experimental data using an unconstrained hexacoordinated cluster, where all of the six Hg-O bond distances were refined (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>). In this case the Hg(II)-O distances are spread between 2.19 and 2.44 ร, with an average value of 2.31 ร, and R sq is 9.9 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Thus all the hexahydrated models lead to a quite poor agreement between the experiment and the calculated spectra, especially in the low-energy region of the spectrum. In particular, the measured XANES spectrum exhibits a shoulder at the main transition edge that could not be reproduced (insets of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), and a poor agreement between the experiment and the calculated model is found also in the high-energy range of the spectrum (12350-12600 eV) for the regular and Jahn-Teller distorted octahedra. In the case of the unconstrained hexacoordinated model, the Hg(II)-O distances are quite spread and the structural disorder reduces the amplitude of the signal at high energy, resulting in a better agreement with the experimental data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>). Nevertheless, the frequency is not completely correct and the shoulder at the main edge is not reproduced (see inset of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>). All together these findings suggest that, at variance with all the previously reported results, 5,7 the Hg(II) aqua ion does not adopt an octahedral coordination, and it forms a quite flexible hydration complex.</p><p>We have thus performed a comprehensive quantum mechanical study of different [Hg(H 2 O) n ] 2+ (n ) 6-8) clusters both in a vacuum and simulating bulk solvent effects by the PCM   (polarizable continuum model). <ref type="bibr">21,</ref><ref type="bibr">22</ref> Full geometry optimizations lead to true energy minima (all positive Hessian eigenvalues) for hexa-, hepta-, and octacoordinated species with T h , C 2 , and S 8 symmetry, respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Furthermore, displacement of one water molecule from the first solvation sphere of [Hg(H 2 O) 7 ] 2+ leads, as already found for other metal ions, 37 to a structure retaining C 2 symmetry in which the seventh water molecule forms two hydrogen bonds with two water molecules of the first coordination sphere. The structure with one water molecule in the second shell is significantly more stable for the isolated clusters, but the hexaand heptacoordinated species become nearly isoenergetic (โE ) 0.0003 au ) 0.8 kJ/mol) when bulk solvent effects are taken into account through the PCM (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</p><p>It is remarkable that such a strong solvent induced energy variation occurs with only negligible geometry modifications, i.e., a shortening by about 0.05 ร of a couple water molecules in the heptacoordinated species (Hg-O4 distance in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Inclusion of nonpotential energy terms (zero-point energy, thermal enthalpic, and entropic contributions) <ref type="bibr">38</ref> does not modify the results in an appreciable way. Thus, our QM computations suggest that in aqueous solution the Hg(II) ion could have a quite flexible coordination. Furthermore, charge transfer is negligible for all the studied systems (maximum charge of 0.02 on a single water molecule from a Mulliken population analysis), so that effective two-body potentials can be confidently derived.</p><p>In order to proceed further, we decided to perform a 60 ns long MD simulation of the Hg(II) ion in aqueous solution (at least 1 order of magnitude longer than the estimated residence time of water molecules in the first Hg(II) shell). <ref type="bibr">8</ref> This simulation length allows one to predict the water exchange rate with the bulk of the liquid and to evidence transitions between different possible coordination geometries of the Hg(II) hydration complex. The long simulation time needed to evaluate water residence time and the ongoing discussion about the reliability of current density functionals in the description of water exchange mechanisms 37 do not allow the use of first principle extended Lagrangian dynamics. Thus, we resorted to fitting reliable two-body empirical Hg(II)-H 2 O potentials from MP2 computations in a vacuum and to adding effective many-body contributions by the procedure validated in our previous studies, which relies on the proper use of PCM computations. <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16</ref> As previously mentioned, the simulated system consists of one Hg(II) ion and 819 SPC/E water molecules, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">28</ref> and the simulation started from a hexacoordinated first shell configuration. After a quite long induction time (about 630 ps) the system goes to heptacoordination, which remains stable for most  a Ri (ร) are the Hg(II)-O distances, Res (eV) is resolution broadening, Eo (eV) is the theoretical absorption edge position, Rsq is the fit index parameter (eq 1), and n is the number of independent structural parameters used in the fitting procedure.  a Energy values of the isolated water molecule and of the most stable isomer of the hexacoordinated cluster with one water molecule in the second shell are also reported.</p><p>of the remaining simulation time except for a few transitions to hexa-(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>) and octacoordinated clusters (8 and 13 transitions from hepta-to hexa-and octacoordinated clusters, respectively). It is noteworthy that during the induction time we observe a number of attempts of a seventh water molecule to enter the first solvation shell of Hg(II) resembling the results of previous short QM/MM simulations, which were interpreted in terms of a heptacoordinated transition state between two different hexacoordinated energy minima. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> The obtained radial distribution function g HgO (r) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>) shows a well-defined first solvation shell with a peak distance R HgO of 2.28 ร and with a hydration number of 7 by integration up to 3.8 ร. The structural results, therefore, evidence the dominance during the simulation of the heptahydrated complex since the hexa-and octacoordinated species are present only for about 2.6 and 0.6% of the analyzed time (i.e., from 5 to 65 ns of simulation time), respectively. The longest lifetimes for the hexa-, hepta-and octacoordinated hydration shell are 0.37, 8.02 and 0.14 ns, respectively. The mean residence time of the water molecules in the first hydration shell is 7.4 ns, of the same order of magnitude of the experimental estimated value (about 1 ns), obtained by Eigen in 1963 with ultrasound absorption, where the rate constants are estimated from SO 4 2-complexation reactions. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Inclusion of explicit many-body effects is crucial for the description of ions in aqueous solution, <ref type="bibr">40</ref> and we have already shown for Cd(II) in water that the approach summarized by eq 2 accounts for averaged many-body terms in an effective twobody classical potential. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We have estimated the effect of manybody contributions in the Hg(II) hydrated system by comparing the results issuing from use of the complete effective potential with those delivered by a conventional pair additive potential, obtained by the in vacuum ab initio calculations of the Hg(II) ion and one water molecule at the MP2 level. The pure pair additive potential is more attractive and gives rise to a longer Hg-O coordination distance as compared to the effective twobody one, in the Hg(II)-water minimum configuration (Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref>). An additional MD simulation has been performed using the pure pair additive potentials (see forcefield parameters in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), and the obtained radial distribution function g HgO (r) and hydration number N(r) have been compared with the corresponding curves for the effective two-body potential (Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2B</ref>). The most evident effect of the use of a pure pair additive potential concerns the increase in the number of water molecules coordinated around the Hg(II) ion (9.5 by integration up to 3.8 ร), as compared to the hydration number obtained with the effective two-body potential (7 by the same integration). This finding closely parallels the reduction in coordination number (from 7.35 to 6 for the Mg(II) aqueous solution) found by Spรฅngberg and Hermansson when adding three-body terms. <ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">41</ref> Moreover, in the case of the pure pair additive potential, the oxygen and hydrogen g(r)'s are not well separated between first and second hydration shells, indicating a more disordered coordination structure around the ion. Therefore, the inclusion of the many-body terms with our method has a clear effect on the structural and dynamic properties of the Hg(II) hydration shell, while its computational efficiency allows one to carry out extremely long MD simulations which are necessary to reproduce the dynamic properties of ionic solutions with flexible hydration shells.</p><p>The combined QM and MD results strongly suggest that the hydrated Hg(II) ion is characterized by a quite flexible heptacoordinated structure whose energy minimum has a C 2 symmetry. Therefore, we reinterpreted the XANES spectrum in terms of a heptahydrated Hg(II) ion. We performed a minimization of the experimental data starting from the ab initio energy minimum structure of the [Hg(H 2 O) 7 ] 2+ complex shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>, refining four structural parameters while retaining a C 2 symmetry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). The Hg(II)-O distances obtained from the minimization procedure are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>. The Hg(II)-O average distance is 2.31 ร in agreement with the EXAFS determination, and the R sq value obtained was 1.6 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>A second fit was performed using an unconstrained heptacoordinated model where all seven Hg-O distances were refined separately. Also in this case a similar geometry was obtained from the minimization procedure with a Hg(II)-O average distance of 2.32 ร and R sq ) 1.1. The availability of new degrees of freedom in the minimization procedure does not significantly change the quality of the fit, and it produces a slightly different set of structural parameters, still corresponding to a C 2 symmetry. An additional fit of the experimental data was performed starting from a cluster having seven equal Hg-O distances arranged in a C 2 symmetry and keeping such a symmetry during the minimization by refining a single distance. The optimized Hg(II)-O distance is 2.30 ร, and the agreement between the experimental and theoretical data was not good (R sq ) 15.0), thus showing that the water molecules in the Hg-O heptacoordinated cluster are arranged in a less symmetrical fashion. Attempts to fit the XANES spectrum with a mixture of hexaand heptahydrated clusters showed that the experimental data can be reproduced only for a strong dominance (higher than 90%) of the heptacoordinated species.</p><p>The picture emerging from these tests is both enlightening and intriguing. If a single first shell model cluster is used to fit the XANES data, the best agreement is obtained when a sevenfold coordination within a C 2 symmetry and a quite large distance dispersion (defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum Hg-O bond length) is considered (0.38  ร). However, the dispersion of distances obtained for the heptahydrated cluster from MP2 calculations is much smaller (0.09 ร, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>), and this is also the case for the MD simulations (0.12 ร). Note that the distance dispersion along the MD simulation has been estimated selecting a window (Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>) around the longest lifetime of the heptacoordinated species. One might therefore conclude that a proper fit of the XANES data needs a wider distance dispersion than that obtained from the theoretical heptahydrate models. This discrepancy can be due to two main reasons: the need to account for the structural disorder within the first hydration shell in the analysis of the XANES data, and the influence of the second hydration shell on the low-energy range of the absorption spectrum.</p><p>Unfortunately, the effect of the high mobility of the second hydration shell does not allow construction of reliable static models including its effect. One must, therefore, resort to analysis of the XANES spectra by the microscopic description of the system derived from MD simulations, as done, for instance, with remarkable success for the case of Ni(II) and Cr-(III) ions in aqueous solution. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Ongoing application of the same procedure to a Hg(II) aqueous solution faces the need for major computer resources connected to the high atomic number of the photoabsorber atom and the flexibility of the hydrated structure. In the meantime, we thought it interesting to analyze a limited number of snapshots issuing from MD simulations, including all the water molecules providing nonnegligible contributions to the spectrum: this defines a cutoff radius of 5.2 ร from the cation and 17 water molecules. In particular, we have considered two sets of 10 snapshots each for the heptacoordinated complex (characterized by distance dispersions in the first shell of 0.12 and 0.28 ร, respectively) and a third set of 10 snapshots for the hexahydrated complex (with a distance dispersion of the ion in the first shell of 0.11 ร). The agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectra is much better for the heptacoordinated set with a small distance dispersion (average R sq values ) 5.2, 10.2, and 16.3, respectively). This suggests that the second hydration shell provides a detectable contribution to the XANES spectrum and that the wide distance dispersion obtained from the XANES minimization using a single representative configuration tries to mimic the contribution of the neglected second hydration shell. Moreover the compatibility of the XANES data with a heptahydrated Hg(II) first shell cluster is confirmed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We have reported the main results of the first quantitative analysis of the XANES spectrum of a Hg(II) aqueous solution using the recently developed MXAN method, starting from QM ab initio and MD theoretical results. The combined use of XAS experimental data, accurate QM calculations, and MD simulations allowed us to determine, in contrast to all the previously reported results, a quite unexpected sevenfold coordination of the hydrated Hg(II) complex in aqueous solution. The generally accepted octahedral solvation structure of the Hg(II) ion could not be reconciled with XAS results, and refined QM computations pointed out the remarkable stability of a heptacoordinated structure with C 2 symmetry. Moreover, long-time MD simulations by new two-body interaction potentials, taking into account nonadditive solvent effects in an effective way, revealed that the hydrated complex undergoes frequent transformations among several flexible heptacoordinated complexes.</p><p>The best-fit model cluster, obtained from the XANES data analysis, shows a larger distance dispersion as compared to the MP2 and MD theoretical models. This discrepancy is most probably due to the necessity of including the second hydration shell in the calculation of the XANES spectra, and additional investigations are underway to shed light on this point.</p><p>In conclusion, while none of the separate techniques available to study metal ions in solution would be sufficient to give an unequivocal structural result, the coherent picture provided by accurate QM calculations, MD simulations, and XAS experimental results provides convincing evidence for a dynamical picture of the Hg(II) first hydration shell involving a flexible heptacoordinated cluster. This is at variance with the octahedral structure usually present in the solid state <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">43</ref> and suggested by previous short time MD simulation. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> These findings are exemplary in pointing out the limits of transferring solid-state results to assess the structural properties of metal ions in aqueous solutions, as already observed, for example, in the case of the Cu(II) hydrate in the solid state and solution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">44</ref> The original application of both experimental and computational techniques used in the present research paves the route for the systematic use of an integrated approach, with increased reliability, in the structural investigation of liquid samples and biological media.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>(</head><figDesc>36) D'Angelo, P.; Barone, V.; Chillemi, G.; Sanna, N.; Meyer-Klaucke, W.; Pavel, N.
