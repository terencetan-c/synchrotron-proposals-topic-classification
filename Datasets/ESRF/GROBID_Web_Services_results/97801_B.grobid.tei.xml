<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aim Graphene has the potential to revolutionize the field of printed electronics thanks to its high conductivity, chemical stability and natural abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. We have previously developed conductive screen printing inks through the gelation of graphene-polymer dispersions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. The gelation mechanism of these inks and the role of polymeric stabilizers therein is still poorly understood. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we aim at mapping the effects of synthesis parameters on the dimensions of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) at low concentrations, and the effects of polymeric stabilizers on the colloidal interactions and stability of GNPs at higher concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>To study the effect of synthesis parameters on GNP dimensions, GNPs were prepared from raw graphite according to an intercalation and thermal expansion protocol followed by exfoliation via high-shear mixing as published previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. The exfoliation conditions were varied to investigate the effect of several additives, additive concentrations and solvent choice on the platelet morphology. The raw graphite source and intermediate products of the intercalation and expansion process were also studied to understand the morphological changes induced by these transitions.</p><p>Commercial GNPs with a diameter of 5 µm were dispersed in several solvents (water, ethanol, ethyl acetate) with a high-shear mixer. Several additives (ethyl cellulose, sodium deoxycholate) were added in varying concentrations to study the effect of additives on the GNP colloidal interactions.</p><p>All samples were brought to ID02 in quartz capillaries for the efficient measurement of a high number of samples. In addition, a series of dispersions with several additive concentrations were sedimented in situ to quantify their colloidal stability. Furthermore, several dispersions were heated in situ to investigate temperature-induced morphological changes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results</head><p>We investigated the production process of GNP through intercalation and thermal expansion of raw graphite <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. The WAXS pattern of raw graphite (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) contains a peak at q = 18.5 nm -1 , corresponding to the graphene layer spacing of 0.34 nm (4). Interestingly, this peak broadens and flattens significantly upon intercalation of graphite with small molecules, producing intercalated graphite (IG). After thermal expansion and intercalation, the typical graphene layer spacing returns. In contrast, the SAXS patterns (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) reveal no changes after intercalation with the slope remaining -3.4, while thermally expanded graphite (TEG) has a slope of -2.3. The absolute slope increases slightly to -2.8 after exfoliation. The decrease in fractal dimension from raw graphite to GNP thus confirms exfoliation of the particles. Next, we will fit form factors to the SAXS patterns to extract deeper morphological information from these patterns. In addition, we will investigate how exfoliation conditions, e.g. solvent type and additive concentration, affect the GNP form factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 Evolution of SAXS (left) and WAXS (right) patterns for the processing of raw graphite into graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) via intercalation with small molecules to produce intercalated graphite (IG), followed by thermal expansion yielding thermally expanded graphite (TEG) and finally liquid-phase exfoliation resulting in GNPs. Slopes of the SAXS curves are -3.4 for raw graphite and IG, -2.3 for TEG and -2.8 for GNP.</head><p>To investigate the colloidal stability of GNP dispersions in ethanol with varying additive (ethyl cellulose) concentrations, we let our samples sediment inside the capillary overnight. After sedimentation, the scattered intensity at the top of the capillary increased with ethyl cellulose concentration, indicating a decrease in sedimentation rate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Therefore, it is concluded that additives can be used to tune the colloidal stability of GNP dispersions.</p><p>We produce graphene nanoplatelets via high-shear exfoliation of expanded graphite. This produces nanoplatelets with a range of thicknesses depending on the exfoliation conditions. To investigate the thickness distributions, we fitted a form factor for lamellar disks to the SAXS pattern. The procedure is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> for two types of graphene nanoplatelets. The data shows that our in-house GNP is approximately ten times thinner and less polydisperse than its commerical counterpart. Next, we will investigate changes in the form factor (platelet stacking versus proper dispersion) and structure factor induced by the addition of additives. Although our GNP model system turned out slightly too large to characterize the full lateral dimensions of the particles, we expect to obtain significant insight by fitting form factors to the SAXS patterns according to the procedure detailed in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. We will complement the SAXS data with in-house dynamic light scattering measurements to obtain the full platelet dimensions. Next time, we would use a slightly smaller model system. </p></div>
