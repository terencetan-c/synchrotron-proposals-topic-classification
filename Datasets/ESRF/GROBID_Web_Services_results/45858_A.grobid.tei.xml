<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal summary:</head><p>Phase Change Materials (PCM) such as GeTe or Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) are currently excellent candidates for use in non volatile memories in Phase Change Random Access Memory (PC-RAM). In PC-RAM, the material switches from a high resistance amorphous state to a low resistance crystalline state, which allows to store information. For applications a high retention time, a high thermal stability of the amorphous phase and a high cyclability are mandatory. GeTe and GeSb6 have shown promising results with respect to thermal stability. The aim of this proposal was to anneal in situ during the diffraction experiments some films of GeSb6 and GeTe, 30 and 150nm thick. Although GeSb6 was a promising phase change material <ref type="bibr">(REF 3 of proposal: Cabral et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 93 (2008)</ref> 071906.), difficulties met later in its integration in PCRAMs have lead to discard its use. Therefore we focused only on the study of the crystallization of GeTe. Morover, confining the phase change material has a strong impact on the crystallization mechanism. For GST thin films it has been demonstrated that the crystallization temperature increases when reducing the thickness of the film under 30nm, with a clear influence of the interface material (R. E. <ref type="bibr">Simpson et al., Nano Lett., 2010, 10 (2)</ref>, pp 414-419). Considering the continuous scaling of devices and recent studies performed at CEA-LETI, we extended the thickness range down to 5 nm and studied the impact of the material interface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment &amp; results:</head><p>Samples of GeTe thin films with different material interfaces (Ta, TiN and SiO 2 ) have been prepared. For each interface material, GeTe film of various thicknesses has been deposited: 5, 10, 30 and 100 nm. The incident X-ray energy has been chosen equal to 17.485 keV and the 2D detector was the CCD Princeton@ camera (16 bits dynamics &amp; 1340x1300 pixels of 50x50 µm 2 ).</p><p>In order to find the best conditions for the in situ experiments and check the feasability of measurements on the thinnest samples, we first performed X-ray diffraction on samples annealed ex situ (one sample of each kind) for 15mins@450°C. The 2θ range has been chosen between 10° and 25° and each sample has been measured both in t he θ-2θ configuration (angle of incidence 8.5°) and in the same 2 θ range with an incident angle of 2°. From these ex situ experiments we found that crystalline films interfaced with SiO 2 are strongly textured, those interfaced with TiN are only slightly textured while those interfaced with Ta are isotropic. We validated the possibility of measuring the thinnest samples (5 nm). To perform X-Ray diffraction experiments during in situ annealing we used an Anton Paar DHS900 furnace equipped with a PEEK plastic dome. We had difficulties in installing the experimental setup and in choosing the best dome. Finally we have been able to measure films of 5, 10 and 30 nm interfaced with SiO 2 and films of 10 and 30 nm interfaced with TiN. For each sample the temperature has been raised by steps of 5°C each 10 minutes and three measurements were performed for each temperature step. Some runs were spoiled by bad command transmission to the furnace current supply. Quantitative analysis of the images is in progress.</p></div>		</body>
