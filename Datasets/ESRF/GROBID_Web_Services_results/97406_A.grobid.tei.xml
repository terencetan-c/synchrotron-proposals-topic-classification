<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed XAS measurements on YBa2Cu3O7/Ndx(Ca1-ySry)1-xMnO3 (YBCO/NCSMO) multilayers for which different kinds of Cu-based density wave orders can be induced via the hole doping, x, and the Sr:Ca ratio, y, (or the tolerance factor, t) of the manganite layer. We measured high resolution XAS in TFY and TEY mode around the Cu L-edge as well as Mn-L-edge at grazing incidence geometry. In these samples, the YBCO thickness being 7 nm, the measurement took aprox 6 hours per temperature per magnetic field at LV, LH, C+ and C-polarizations. We measured NYN heterostructures with (1) x=0.5, y=0.25 (2 samples), (2) x=0. <ref type="bibr">35, y=0.3 and (3) x=0.42, y=0.3</ref> (2 samples), (4) x=0.42, y=0.7.</p><p>Further, long-range scans from 500 eV-1000 ev and scans around the Oxygen edge (500 -600 eV) were recorded.</p><p>Additionally, we performed similar scans for two Sr2IrO4 (SIO, 20nm)/YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO, 14 nm) hterostructure sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary for NYN heterostructure samples:</head><p>They scans reveal that the charge/orbital ordering of NCSMO has a strong influence on the anomalous orbital occupation of the interfacial Cu ions of YBCO. Correlation between the strength of the charge/orbital order in NCSMO and the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial Cu ions in YBCO (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Temperature and magnetic field dependence on the Mn-edge shows a complex evolution of Mnmagnetic moemnt. However, the Mn-FY data suffers from self-absorption and hence need to be treated more carefully. In summary, we observe much stronger charge transfer and orbital reconstruction for x ≤ 0.42, whereas we have observed a completely new Cu-TEY peak at ~ 2.5eV higher than Cu-L3 edge, that gets modulated with applied magnetic field (marked by ↓ in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Summary for SIO/YBCO heterostructure samples: Summary for S/Y heterostructure samples: We have measured XAS spectra of the Cu L-edge (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(c)</ref>, <ref type="figure">(d</ref>)) for a LSAT-SIO-YBCO sample. The XAS data in zero field (Fig. <ref type="figure">(c</ref>)) exhibit ≈ 500 meV difference for the in-plane polarization between the interface (Total Electron Yield (TEY)) and bulk contributions (Fluorescence Yield (FY)) from the YBCO layer indicating a charge transfer at the interface. While the maximum of the TEY line is polarization dependent (with a difference of ≈ 100 meV), the differently shaped 2-component FY spectra exhibits a much larger XLD. An increase of magnetic field to 9 T decreases the TEY absorption dramatically even though the line shapes remain unchanged. To obtain a complete picture of the electronic/spin interactions in these samples, we need complimentary information from the absorption on the Ir-L edge. This will help us to explain the nature of the atomic orbitals involved in forming the electronic structure at the interface.</p><p>We are still analyzing the remaining dataset by means of simulation and are trying to correlate with the measurements from other experiments like RIXS, REXS and transport measurements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Dr. Christian Bernhard, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Dr. Subhrangsu Sarkar, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Dr. Roxana Gaina, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Jonas Knobel, University of Fribourg, Switzerland</figDesc></figure>
