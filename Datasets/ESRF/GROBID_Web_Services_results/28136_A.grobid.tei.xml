<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Lithium electrochemical intercalation-deintercalation in host structures results most of the time in phase transitions that are either 1 st or 2 nd order. Displacive structural transitions are associated to small hysteresis whereas hysteresis larger than 0.2V have been reported for reconstructive phase transitions. This experiment mainly concerned Li 4 VO(PO 4 ) 2 , that exhibits first order structural phase transformations upon Li insertion-removal associated to potential hysteresis values that span from a few mV to more than 1.8V. Li 4 VO(PO 4 ) 2 is obtained from VO(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 upon a H + /Li + exchange using Li ethanolate solutions. First structural refinements allowed to determine the structure of Li 4 VO(PO 4 ) 2 which is isostructural with that of the protonated form VO(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 but with vanadium disordered over two sites (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> a=8.820008(1)Å, c=8.754524(1)Å, P 4 /ncc, R wp =14.7%, R exp =12.3%, R B =6.72%). The structure is also characterized by an increase of the V-O bonds in the c direction as expected from the increase of the c parameter (+10%) upon the ionic exchange. The microstructure was assed from profile analysis using spherical harmonics, specific profiles for (h+k+l)=2n+1 lines (stacking faults) for the size contribution to the FWHM and an axial strain model to take into account the microdeformation contribution. Results clearly showed that starting rod like crystallites of VO(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 break apart in the c direction to give parallepipedic like objects. Electrochemical deinsertion of Li + from the lithiated form occurs in two steps. Corresponding compounds could be indexed with the same metric. Structural refinements are underway. The overall effect of the delithiation-oxidation is a decrease of the intra-layer distances due to V(IV) oxidation to V(V) and an increase of the inter-layer distances owing to the removal of the polarizing Li + ions. Regarding the insertion process, three new compounds appear but we could not index the corresponding diagrams so far. This experiment also permit to determine space groups and indexations using Dicvol and Checkcell of two new compounds LiV 3 O 8 .H 2 O (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) (a=15.5719(3)Å, b=7.1676(1) Å and c=12.1413(3) Å, β=91.708(1)°, P2 1 /m, R wp =6.3%, R exp =5.2%). and a decavandate of lithium (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). (a=17.6243(3)Å, b=10.3259(2) Å and c=9.2277(2) Å, Pnnm, R wp =8.9%, R exp =7.6%). According to the metric the former is presumably of the hewettite type as Ba 0.5 V 3 O 8 .6H 2 O. Ab-initio structural determination is underway.   u + 2È (°) 2è (°)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Structural refinement of Li 4 VO(PO 4 ) 2 (λ=0.79943 Å).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,109.44,138.80,377.76,297.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
