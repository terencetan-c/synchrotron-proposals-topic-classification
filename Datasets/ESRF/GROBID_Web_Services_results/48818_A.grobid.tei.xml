<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments undertaken during the previous beamtime were aimed at understanding the electronic structure of oxy-myoglobin (MbO 2 ), specifically regarding the nature of the bound O 2 . The state of the O 2oxy, superoxo, or peroxo-has been an outstanding question in bioinorganic chemistry for many decades and has important implications for the chemistry of oxygen activation. To attempt to understand this system, Fe Kβ x-ray emission spectra (XES) and Kβ high resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) x-ray absorption data were taken on MbO 2 as well as deoxy-Mb and oxidized met-Mb.</p><p>Kβ HERFD spectra for the three protein states are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. As expected, the edge for met-Mb appears slightly more than 1 eV higher in energy than that for deoxy-Mb, reflecting the presence of a more oxidized Fe in met-Mb (Fe III versus Fe II in deoxy-Mb). Interestingly, the edge for MbO 2 lies very close to that of met-Mb, suggesting MbO 2 possesses an Fe III , as well. An Fe III present in MbO 2 would then indicate that the O 2 must exist in its singly-reduced form, superoxide (O 2 -). To further support this hypothesis, we next employed Kβ XES.</p><p>The XES mainlines and valence-to-core regions are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and b, respectively. The mainline region of the spectrum is known to be sensitive to both spin state at the metal center as well as metal-ligand covalency, with the intensity of the Kβ' feature (~7045 eV) gaining intensity as the number of unpaired spins at the metal increases. Most straightforwardly, the mainline of deoxy-Mb clearly shows a high spin state, consistent with previous characterization of the Fe as high spin Fe II . Similarly, with reference to the HERFD data, met-Mb is consistent with a relatively covalent high spin Fe III complex. This high covalency can be explained by the significantly shorter bond lengths present in met-Mb compared to deoxy-Mb; similar effects have been seen in studies of other systems. The mainline for MbO 2 , in contrast, indicates a low spin Fe III center, also consistent with previous assignment.</p><p>The valence-to-core region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) consists of transitions that result from dominantly ligand localized valence orbitals and thus acts as a probe of ligand identity and electronic structure. Of greatest importance for the current study are the so-called "satellite" features occurring between 7085 and 7100 eV that originate from predominantly ligand 2s-based orbtials and that can be used to assess the O-O bond length. Broadly, the valence-to-core data are consistent with what has already been seen: deoxy-Mb has the lowest intensity Kβ 2,5 feature (~7107 eV), consistent with a high spin state and long metal-ligand bonds, while met-Mb and MbO 2 have a higher intensity, sharper Kβ 2,5 that is typically associated with a lower spin state and/or shorter bond lengths. Unfortunately, the satellite features we were hoping to observe were of very low intensity. From attempts to deconvolute the spectra, it is known that peaks exist in this region, but the intensitites are too low to assign precise energies.</p><p>One idea to remedy this situation was to employ resonant excitation via a RIXS experiment to enhance certain valence-to-core features, similar to what is done in resonance Raman. By taking advantage of the ligand localized transitions that dominate the valence-to-core and pre-edge regions of XES and XAS, it was hoped that valence band resonant RIXS could be employed to enhance the weak satellite features we hoped to see.</p><p>To test the feasibility of this experiment, we examined a selection of manganese model compounds known to have intense pre-edge and valence-to-core features. A representative valence band RIXS plane as well as a comparison between standard total fluorescence detected XAS and a valence-to-core detected XAS spectrum are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>, respectively, for the compound (NH 4 ) 2 [Mn(CN) 4 N]. It is very easy to see that dramatic enhancements of pre-edge intensity are attainable by detecting XAS from certain valence-to-core region features <ref type="bibr">(over 200% enhanced intensity)</ref>. This observation suggests that applying RIXS to the myoglobin system will enable much more definitive conclusions to be drawn that could be done from the standard, non-resonant techniques.  </p></div>
