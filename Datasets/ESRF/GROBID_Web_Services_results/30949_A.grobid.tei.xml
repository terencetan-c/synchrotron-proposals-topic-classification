<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment HE1867 aimed at developing a novel technique for the analysis of heterogeneous magnetic systems, namely the detection of elemental ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra by means of XMCD on samples resonantly excited at microwave frequencies. The successful outcome of the experiment is reported below.</p><p>Our method exploits the XMCD dependence on the relative orientation between the sample magnetization M and photon polarization P to detect time-averaged variations of the x-ray absorption signal due to the resonant excitation of precession modes that affect the projection of M onto its equilibrium direction. The latter is set parallel to P by an external field B 0 , as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The experimental setup schematically represented in the figure was mounted and tested prior to the beamtime at the EPF Lausanne by means of conventional FMR methods. It consists of a coplanar waveguide λ/2-resonator placed in a static magnetic field B 0 that can be swept between 0 and ± 0.5 T. A YIG (Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 ) polycrystalline slab was chosen as test sample, owing to its intense FMR response. The sample was positioned at the center of the resonator, which produced a microwave magnetic field B 1 ≈ 0.1 mT parallel to the sample surface at its resonance frequency ω = 2π x 2.47 GHz. The experiment was carried out at beamline ID08 using the photon beam generated by its two helical undulators with nearly 100 % circular polarization rate. The beam incidence direction was aligned with B 0 and set perpendicular to the sample surface. X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were measured by recording the sample fluorescence yield by means of a Si photodiode as a function of the incident photon energy. X-ray FMR spectra (XFMR) were recorded at fixed photon energy as a function of B 0 in the presence of the microwave field. For the XFMR measurements, the microwave generator output [Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>] was pulse-modulated at a frequency of 3.5 kHz. The amplified photodiode signal was fed into a lock-in amplifier, which was set to measure the amplitude of the input signal at the pulsemodulation frequency.</p><p>The L 2,3 XMCD spectrum of Fe in YIG is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> (a) as I DC (P + )-I DC (P -), where I DC indicates the DC photodiode current measured in standard fluorescence experiments. The largest dichroic effects at the L 3 and L 2 edges are observed at 709.4 and 722.8 eV, respectively. Figures <ref type="figure">2 (b</ref>) and (c) show the I DC recorded at these energies as a function of B 0 in the four P +-B 0 +-and P +-B 0 -+ configurations. Note that the I DC difference between these configurations, i.e., the XMCD, decreases to zero as B 0 tends to zero, owing to the negligible remanent magnetization of our sample, while it tends to a constant value for B 0 &gt;0.2 T owing to the saturation of the magnetization. The XFMR measurements were performed by setting the photon energy to either 709.4 or 722.8 eV and recording the amplitude of the AC photodiode current I AC at the pulsemodulation frequency of B 1 as a function of B 0 . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the XFMR spectra obtained for the different combinations of P and B 0 . In all cases, we observe a peak at | B 0 | = 0.25 T, in good agreement with the resonant field ω/γ + µ 0 M s = 0.27 T given by Kittel's formula for the uniform precession of the magnetization in a perpendicularly magnetized thin plate. Here, µ 0 M s = 0.18 T for YIG, where M s is the saturation magnetization. The asymmetric character of the resonance peak and its width (∆B 0 ≈ 10 mT at -3 dB) are attributed to imperfections of the sample surface and edges, and to variations of the demagnetizing field across the sample surface. The key feature of the spectra in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> is the reversed sign of the XFMR peak for the P +-B 0 -+ configurations with respect to P +-B 0 +-. This, together with the sign inversion at the L 3 and L 2 edge, represents compelling evidence of the XMCD origin and photon energy dependence of the observed signal. By comparing the amplitude of the XFMR peak (15 pA) with the variation of I DC in Figs. <ref type="figure">2 (b</ref>) and (c) corresponding to the complete reversal of M (5 nA), the variation of the z-component of the magnetization with respect to its static equilibrium value M s is estimated to be about 1 %. An interesting point to be investigated further is that the negative and positive XFMR peaks do not have the same amplitude. Part of this effect is due to the asymmetry of I DC at | B 0 | = 0.25 T with respect to the intensity level of the demagnetized state of the sample, but additional effects related to the influence of microwave absorption on the fluorescence yield might come into play. The signal amplitude was found to increase linearly with applied microwave power (α B 1 2 ), as expected for B 1 &lt;&lt; ∆B 0 . Moreover, we found that I DC and I AC increase linearly with the beam intensity whereas the noise level is proportional to ◊I DC . Therefore, the signal-tonoise ratio can be ameliorated also by maximizing the beam intensity and the solid angle covered by the photodiode.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new method to measure continuous-wave FMR spectra based on the core-level absorption of circularly polarized x-rays. The x-ray FMR signal was shown to be energydependent, which makes the technique element-sensitive and opens up new possibilities to perform elementresolved FMR in magnetic alloys and multilayers <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Given the XAS surface sensitivity, XFMR can be applied to samples with thickness down to a few tens of nm without considerable loss of signal. This makes it straightforward to extend XFMR to metallic samples where the skin-effect limits the penetration of microwave radiation. Future experiments will test the possibility to perform XFMR on metal multilayers and to use the photoelectron yield rather than fluorescence yield detection to further augment the surface sensitivity of the technique. X-ray detection of electron paramagnetic resonance, e.g., on metallorganic compounds, constitutes a possible extension of this technique.</p><p>[1] M. <ref type="bibr">Bonfim et al., Phys. Rev.
