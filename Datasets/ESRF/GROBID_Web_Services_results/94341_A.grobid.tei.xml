<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was carried out remotely in continuos collaboration with the beamline staff, that we thankfully acknowledge. All the procedures carried out to send samples, obtain data and receive back the samples went by smoothly. Our investigation included a total number of 104 samples, measured at two or three sample-todetector distances either in flow-through or regular capillaries. This beamtime allowed us to investigate novel nanovectors obtained by extracting lipids from dry algae biomass and loaded with natural hydrophobic antioxidants of widespread commercial interest, i.e. curcumin, piperine and tocopherol (Vitamin E). Such nanosystems thus obtained usually have complex supramolecular arrangements,so that in-depth structural and morphological studies are needed to formulate robust models. Indeed, we firstly measured the complex nonlamellar systems obtained by this route, then we measured a lamellar systems series obtained form algal material treated with different growth conditions and compared the two series of nanosystems in a complex-tosimple progression. Lastly, our interest lied in the de-structuring and eventual structural rearrangement of the nanocarriers measured at various times during a controlled disruption and release experiment, that we conducted previously in our lab. The aliquots taken from the samples at different time points during such experiment were then sent together with the other samples in their regular state. Such measurement allowed us to assess the structural stability of the nanovectors in hostile pH and temperature conditions, and to complement previous information obtained through spectroscopic techniques.</p><p>Moreover, the comparison of such data among the two series of nanostructures evidenced which types of lipids in the mixture mainly contribute to the assembly in certain phases. This information was then also combined with the role played by type, concentration and localization of cargo bioactive compounds in the structuring. Two exemplificative 1D intensity plots obtained are shown below for complex nonlamellar samples loaded with different cargos (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and lamellar samples loaded with the same molecules and concentrations (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). A paper is in progress using the data collected in this SAXS experiments. Figure 2.
