<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.)LCP type jet provided by ASU</head><p>To have a alternative method to deliver sample for diffraction experiments a liquid injection system developed by ASU was tested at ID 29. Here viscous media allow low flow rates of embedded crystals.</p><p>Here we tested two different media 8M PEG and Cellulose to achieve flow rates of below 2ul/min.</p><p>Stable jets could be achieved with both media. For each sample conditions of crystal flow and embedding have been tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample NendoU</head><p>NendoU crystals could be embedded in 8M PEG as in Cellulose. Not only the embedded crystals looked by microscopy intact, diffraction was obtained to similar and sometime better resolution than the fixed target of the same mutant. A quantitative assessment has to be made in detail,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Photosystem I</head><p>Photosystem I crystals have been embedded in a wide range of concentration of 8 M PEG media. High concentration of media showed already damage via microscopy and even low concentration could not produce diffraction of crystals. With cellulose as embedding media a stability not only in the microscopic picture could be achieved. Here the problem is the embedding in the high viscous media. So far we could obtain diffraction up to 4 A resolution with a hit rate of .3 %</p></div>

For BRD 3-1 high resolution data (2A) and better have been achieved as an new Apo protein structure. C-Phycocyanin can be used for light dependent experiments Photosystem I has found a delivery medium which has to be optimized to achieve a diffraction of 3 A or better.</p><p>Overall, more than 150 TB data have been collected which are waiting for evaluation in detail with several publishable results. <ref type="bibr">(Jernigan et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zerio et al., 2023)</ref> </p></div>			</div>
