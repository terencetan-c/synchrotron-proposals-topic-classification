<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Within the allocated beamtime, we conducted high-presssure (P) and -temperature (T) in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on Fe 3 S samples in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell at ID27. The principal research goal is to place constraints on melting phase relations of Fe 3 S under high pressure.</p><p>In-situ XRD experiments were performed at ID27 with a monochromatic wavelength of 0.3738Å. The sample temperature was measured by the spectroradiometric system availiable on the beamline and the sample pressure was obtained from the Raman shift of the diamond anvil before and after heating.</p><p>We operated ten separate runs: 1 at 32 GPa, 2 at 48 GPa, 1 at 49 GPa, 3 at 56 GPa, 2 at 57GPa, and 1 at 101 GPa. First we increased the pressure at room temperature. At a constant load, the temperature was then increased by laser. XRD patterns were repeatedly collected during laser heating. Laser alignment was made on each sample and the amorphous starting material was turned into crystallline Fe 3 S phase during the alignment. With further increasing temperature, the XRD peaks from Fe 3 S disappered. Also the temperature was getting hard to increase when we lost the peaks. The disappearance of XRD peaks and the observed socalled plateau in temperature may be associated with melting of the sample. Another important observation was that Fe 3 S congruently melted as we did not observe any other solid phases in the system Fe-S.</p><p>Textural observation in a SEM will be made at Univeristy of Edinburgh to provide independent evidence of melting of Fe 3 S.</p></div>			</div>
