<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since NpP had been proposed from neutron experiments <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> to have antiferromagnetic structures of the single-k, double-k, and triple-k classes, we undertook experiments on ID20 to try to confirm this by observing new satellites in the diffraction pattern associated with the multi-k states. We did not observe these resonant magnetic satellites, which suggested that the commensurate magnetic structure of NpP is of the single-k class. We also found evidence for this type of magnetic structure by examining the interplay between the crystal symmetry and the Fourier components of the magnetic structure.</p><p>The high wave vector resolution intrinsic to synchrotron radiation has also proved to be important to obtain a complete picture of the NpP magnetic phase diagram. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows reciprocal lattice scans along the [0, 0, L] direction about the (0, 0, 2+k) position as a function of temperature. The energy and polarization dependencies confirm that all the peaks shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are magnetic, and bulk properties. In agreement with Ref. 1, T N is of the order of 130K. The initial ordering is incommensurate with the crystal lattice and persists down to about 70K until a first order transition occurs to a commensurate phase (k=1/3). The excellent wave vector resolution is especially useful when there are coexisting modulations and has revealed a "splitting" of the incommensurate satellite.  Although we did not observe the k i +k j satellites of a multi-k structure, we did observe a weak resonant satellite at 2k. See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Resonant magnetic harmonics have previously been reported at this position for the cycloid structure of UPtGe <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. It was therefore important to establish whether or not our 2k harmonic was intrinsic to the resonant scattering process. Measurements of the polarization, energy, and temperature dependencies confirmed that the 2k peak is associated with a lattice harmonic, and not related to the magnetic resonant cross section confirming the single-k nature of the commensurate magnetic structure.</p></div>

The energy dependence of the 2k modulation is much narrower than that of the antiferromagnetic resonance (dashed line). The energy dependence of a lattice reflection and the charge harmonic are shown in Fig. 3. The 2k lattice harmonic is resonantly enhanced at the Np M 4 edge. We believe that this resonance is related to the two different lattice sites that the Np atoms occupy in this material. A publication of this experiment is now in draft stage,</figDesc></figure>
