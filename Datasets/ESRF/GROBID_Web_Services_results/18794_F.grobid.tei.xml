We have obtained biochemical evidence of RNA binding to CEF. Therefore CEF crystals were this time submitted to soaks with some short RNA oligonucleotides (4 to 6 bases ) in the presence or absence of the GTP analog or the GpppA cap analog.

AGX1 and AGX2 are the human enzymes responsible for UDPGlcNAc biosynthesis from UTP and GlcNAc-1P in presence of Mg2+. These enzymes are isoforms of the same gene and differ by the insertion in AGX2 of an additional 17-residue segment near the C-terminus. Substrate specificity studies showed that these two enzymes have both UDPGlcNAc and UDPGalNAc synthesis activity at a ratio of 1:3 for AGX1 and 8:1 for AGX2, suggesting that the 17-residue insert is responsible for a change in the enzyme activity 1 .</p><p>To better understand the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes as well as the 17 residue-induced substrate specificity change, we have solved the structures of AGX1 and AGX2 complexed with UDPGlcNAc. The structure of AGX1-UDPGlcNAc was solved by Se-Met MAD at beamline BM14 and refined it at 1.9 Å resolution, whilst that of AGX2-UDPGlcNAc was obtained by molecular replacement using the AGX1 model and data collected on beamline ID14-3. (in first part of the year 2000).</p><p>These structures reveal an AGX fold composed of 3 domains: a large central domain reminiscent of the Rossmann fold, as found in other nucleotidyltransferases, flanked by two smaller extra domains, the N-terminal domain which defines a new fold and the C-terminal domain which is mostly involved in dimerisation of AGX1. Our results provide new features in the architecture of the UDPGlcNAc binding site located at the dimer interface of AGX1. Yet, a better understanding of the reported substrate specificity change between the two enzymes further required the structures of these enzymes complexed with UDPGalNAc. Crystallisation of AGX2 in presence of UDPGalNAc allowed the obtention of the structure from a data set collected during a previous shift. However, a different strategy was employed for AGX1 which required the dissociation of the dimer. Data were collected on one of the crystals obtained and the structure solution showed that UDPGalNAc had partly replaced UDPGlcNAc already present in the active site of AGX1. Experiment title: Protein Crystallography at AFMB CNRS Marseille Experiment number: LS1796 Beamline: ID14 EH2 Date of experiment: from: 5 fev 2001 to: 6 fev 2001 Date of report: Feb 01 Shifts: 3 Local contact(s): Stefanie Monaco Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Mirjam Czjzek, CNRS-AFMB Marseille Bernard Henrissat, CNRS-AFMB Marseille Julie Allouch, CNRS-AFMB Marseille Report: CBM module (family 6) from the xylanase U from C. thermocellum</p><p>Many glycoside hydrolase enzymes are composed of a catalytic domain coupled with one or several "carbohydrate binding modules" ( further called CBM's). These modules, such as the catalytic domains, can be grouped in families, having the same structural fold. Within a family the specificity may vary but the members are marked by highly conserved residues, responsible for the binding sites. The CBM from xylanase U, 133 amino acids long, has been classified in family 6 of the CBM's and we recently determined the structure by MAD on a seleno-methionine, mutant protein. To get high resolution information of the residues involved in substrate binding, the 3D structure of the complex will be of great help. A first temptative of getting a binding module/substrate complex by soaking experiments was performed and a data set of CBM6 crystals soaked for several hours with soluble xylupentaose was collected on ID14 EH2. Unfortunately, it seems that the binding sites are involved in crystal packing contacts and no substrate molecules could be identified in the 2.2 Å density maps. In future experiments we will try to acheive complex structures by cocrystallisation of the CBM6 with xylopentaose and shorter substrate molecules.</p><p>Table 1.

This variability is caused by the presence of one or several variable CBD modules associated with the family 9 catalytic domain within the primary sequence. Cellulase E (82000 Daltons, ~850 aa 1molecule per AU), from C. cellulolyticum is composed of a catlytic domain of family 9, a immunoglobulin-like domain and a CBD of family 4. In order to understand the synergy of the independently structured modules a 3-D structural model of the entire enzyme is of great interest. The molecular replacement with representative 3-D structures of family 9 enzymes failed up to date, since the data collected so far were not complete enough. We modified or cryocooling conditions in order to get crystals displaying less mosaicity and collected a hihgly complete data set at 1.6 Å resolution on ID14</p><p>EH2. The data revealed that the crystals belonged to space group P2 1 2 1 2 (unit cell : a=96.6Å, b=110.6Å c=79.8Å).

They have been the focus of much research recently because of their important roles in a variety of fundamental biological and biotechnological processes. For example, plant β-glucosidases have been implicated in defense against pests, phytohormone activation, lignification and cell wall catabolism. They belong to families 1 and 3 of the glycoside hydrolases and hydrolyze either O-linked β-glycosidic bonds, or S-linked β-glycosidic bonds (myrosinase). The mechanism and the site of substrate (i.e., aglycone) recognition and specificity was directly investigated in maize β-glucosidase by x-ray crystallography using crystals of a catalytically inactive mutant (ZMGlu1E191D) in complex with synthesized inhibitor molecules. The inhibitors are glucose units with the C1 position rigidified by a double bond to a nitrogen group (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These inhibitor molecules mimic the transition state and give helpfull informations of how the substrate olecules are bound within the catalytic active site.</p><p>Table 1.
