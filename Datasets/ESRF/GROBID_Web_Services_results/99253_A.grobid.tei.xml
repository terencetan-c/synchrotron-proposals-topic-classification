<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Here we report on our HR-X-ray diffraction experiments at ID22 on coloured calcite synthesised with organic pigments (naphthazarin, lawsone, Echinochrome A, Spinochrome (B, D, E) and juglone). HR-XRD measurements were carried out to study the effect of the pigment molecules on the crystalline structure of calcite. To do so the HR-XRD profiles were refined with the Rietvelt procedure to evidence possible lattice distortions within the colored calcite samples as respect with pure calcite. In order to enhance eventual and small lattice distortions due to the presence of pigment we also performed HR-XRD measurements upon in situ heating up to temperatures at which the pigments are degraded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>Samples: Calcite samples were prepared by four different methods in the presence of the different organic pigments (at three different concentrations): A, B) precipitation in water at pH=10.5 and 12.5, respectively through the precipitation of ACC particles by the addition of CaCl2 to a Na2CO3 solution and its complete crystallization into calcite after 48 hours under stirring in the absence of NaOH (pH=10.5) and after 5 hours stirring in presence of NaOH (pH=12.5); C) physical mixing by grinding in an agate mortar for 10 min the CaCO3 powder previously synthesized by A) or B) and the pigment powder (0.5wt.%); and D) vapour diffusion in ethanol leading to the formation of ACC particles further filtered, rinsed with cold ethanol and dried for a few minutes in a desiccator under a vacuum. ACC powders were divided into two parts: One part was converted to calcite by heating and the other by stirring it in water for 48 hours. All powder samples were filled in capillaries and mounted on the magnetic spinner for measurement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Methods: HR-XRD measurements were performed at ID22 beamline, ESRF. For our measurements, the beam energy was set to 35KeV and the beam size was 1.0x1.0 mm 2 in crosssection. Si standard NIST 640c was used for calibration. The heating of the samples was carried out by a heat blower available at the beamline and the temperature was increased from 25°C to 450°C at a rate of 10°C/min and stopped for 20min at each relevant temperatures during HR-XRD acquisition.</p><p>Data acquisition and evaluation: X-ray scattering data were acquired using the flat panel Perkin Elmer XRD 1611CP3 detector, which is suited for total scattering measurements at high energies. Recorded 2D patterns were processed using 2D powder diffraction data reduction software available for calibration and data integration. The data integrated was plotted using Origin software. The Rietveld refinement was carried out using a script provided by ID22 beamline scientist for the TOPAS software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Here, we report the results obtained for the syntheses A), B) and C) performed in the presence of naphthazarin molecules for two different concentrations (20 and 100 µg/mL) (Figure1) as these data are being summarized for a first publication, the data obtained for the others pigments will be analyzed in details in a second step.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Naphthazarin-calcite powders obtained after A) precipitation in water at pH 10.5, B) precipitation in water at pH 12.5 and C) physical mixing of naphthazarin with CaCO3 previously synthesized at pH=10.5 and pH=12.5.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> A) shows the HR-XRD profiles of pure and naphthazarin-calcite powders confirming that all samples were indeed calcitic. Figure <ref type="figure">2 B</ref>) displays the ( <ref type="formula">104</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">006</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) reflection of geological calcite and pure calcite synthesized by precipitation in water at pH 10.5 and 12.5 evidencing the difference in structure between the three samples. Calcite synthesized at pH=12.5 is less crystalline whereas once synthesized at pH=10.5 it is as crystalline as geological calcite but present peak shift to lower 2Theta, suggesting higher lattice parameters as confirmed by the results of Rietveld refinement (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Lattice distortions were calculated as compared to geological calcite. For pH=10.5, calcite lattice distrotions are isotropic with relatively low Δc/c and Δa/a (0.05%) while for pH=12.5, lattice distortions are anisotropic with Δa/a quite important (0.24%) and Δc/c very low (0.01%).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. A) X-rays diffractograms of pure calcite and naphthazarin-calcite powders synthesized at pH=10.5 and B) ( <ref type="formula">104</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">006</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) reflection of geological calcite as compared to pure calcite synthesized at pH 10.5 and 12.5.</p><p>Table1: Calcite lattice parameters extracted by applying Rietveld refinements to the HR-XRD profiles of the different samples with one calcite phase (in red) and two calcite phases (in black).</p><p>The comparison of ( <ref type="formula">104</ref>), (006), and (110) peaks of HR-XRD profiles of calcite synthesized at pH=12.5 without and with naphthazarin molecules suggests that the presence of pigment introduces a significant peak shift only for the (110) (Figure <ref type="figure">3 A</ref>)). This is reflected in the calculated anisotropic lattice distortions with |Δa/a|=0.12% and neglegible |Δc/c|. The comparison of ( <ref type="formula">104</ref>), (006), and ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) peaks of HR-XRD profiles of calcite synthesized at pH=10.5 without and with naphthazarin molecules suggests that the presence of pigment does not introduce significant peak shift (Figure <ref type="figure">3 B</ref>)). Indeed |Δc/c|= 0.001-0.008% indicates that the lattice distortion in the c axis direction is negligible when compared to sea urchins spines (0.03%) or mollusk shells (0.1%). The addition of naphthazarin however only introduces a broadening of the peaks. In addition, it can be observed a peak splitting of the (110) peak suggesting the possibility of another phase in our system. Therefore, Rietveld refinement has been also perfomed with two different calcite pahses (Table1). This sencondary peak is much broader than the main peak suggesting smaller cristallites. However, this peak is also present in the pure synthetic calcite and is the most intense in the sample formed by physical mixing therefore, its origin must still be investigated.  <ref type="formula">104</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">006</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) reflections of HR-XRD profiles once normalized of pure calcite, 20 and 100 µg/mL-naphthazarin-calcite synthesized at A) pH=12.5 and B) pH=10.5.</p><p>One clue is its disappearing after heating (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). In situ heating experiments were conducted to reveal small calcite lattice distortions induced by the presence of pigments before and after heating. In biogenic samples, 400°C is sufficient to guarantee most of the organic destruction and colors were observed to fade away at 200°C in sea urchin spines. Here, we observe that at 400°C the color is still present even if changed from bleu to purple. However, despite the disappearing of the peak splitting at 200°C no significant peak shift and slight peak broadening are observed. At 200°C structural water associated (or not) with the pigment molecules might be the origin of this change of structure but furhter studies are needed.  <ref type="formula">006</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) peaks for pure calcite and calcite + 0.02mg/ml naphthazarin at 25°C, 200°C and 400°C.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure 3.
