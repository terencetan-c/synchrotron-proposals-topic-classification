<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Small angle x ray scattering (SAXS) measurements have been performed on a solution of 4methyl-piridyne (4MP) (C 6 H 7 N), α-cyclodextrin (αCD) (C 36 H 60 O 30 ) and water as a function of the temperature in the range 300÷475K. The incident photons had an energy of 10.2 keV ( λ= 1.21 Å ). The sample was confined in a 2 mm diameter borosilicate capillary. The detector was placed at a distance of almost 7.6m from the centre of the sample and the intensity was collected in the Q range 0.07÷1 nm -1 . The geometrical parameters of the measurements were calibrated via a standard of collagen and the two dimensional diffraction patterns were collapsed to a 1D patterns using the FIT2D software package . The sample has been prepared at three different concentrations of αCD, water and 4MP with molar ratios respectively of 1:6:x, and x=80,120,200. Previous x-ray diffraction experiment performed in the Q range 1.5÷32 nm -1 , as a function of the temperature in this concentration region confirmed the existence of a disordered structure both below and above the transition temperature detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) [1]. These data showed an increasing of the scattered intensity in the low Q region suggesting the hypothesis of being in presence of a critical phenomenon.</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to try to understand the nature of the transition detected by DSC and x-ray diffraction and in particular to focus the attention on the low Q behaviour of the scattered intensity. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> a sample of the scattered intensities at the three indicated</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Structural determination of the liquid-liquid phase transition in a 4-methylpiridyne/alpha-cyclodextrin/water solution At increasing temperature an abrupt increase of the low Q scattered intensity is observed for all the three investigated concentrations, showing therefore a different behaviour between the low and high temperature samples. This difference although less evident is still present as the concentration is lowered (1:6:200). A power law behaviour, with a slope of approximately -3.2, is shown in double logarithmic representation for Q&lt;0.26nm -1 in the solution 1:6:80, for Q&lt;0.23nm -1 in the solution 1:6:120 and for Q&lt;0.16nm -1 in the solution 1:6:200. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>function of the temperature across the thermodynamic endothermic transition observed by DSC [1] is shown in double logarithmic scale.</figDesc></figure>
