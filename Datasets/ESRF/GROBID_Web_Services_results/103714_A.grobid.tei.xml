<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>along with modulation of properties of OSMs by molecular design allows to fabricate various electronic devices such as organic solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> , organic photodetectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> , and organic fieldeffect transistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> with desired functions. In the last decade, organic semiconductors with conjugated backbone structure have also found application in perovskite solar cells as dopant-free hole-or electron-transport materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> . The efficiency of organic or hybrid electronics is strongly influenced by the charge carrier mobility of OSMs, which in turn is closely related to their electronic structure, conformation, and molecular ordering in solid state <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Charge-transport characteristics of conjugated polymers are usually limited due to their inherently disordered nature resulting in a large number of charge traps <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> .</p><p>In this regard, the small conjugated molecules exhibiting well-defined structure and a high degree of order attract much interest since these advantages are beneficial for efficient transport of the charge carriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . The charge mobility of small molecules can be additionally improved by thermal annealing of films based on them. This approach allows to govern the morphology and increase the crystallinity of thin films through the rearrangement of small molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> . Since the transport of charge carriers within the crystalline domains is facilitated, thermal annealing can be considered as a powerful and straightforward tool for enhancing the performance of organic and hybrid electronic devices.</p><p>In our previous works, we reported the synthesis of a family of thiophene(T)-benzothiadiazole(B) small molecules with the general formula of TBTBT, which were shown to be promising components of active layer for organic solar cells, p-type semiconductor materials for field-effect transistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> , and hole-transport materials for perovskite solar cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . Although the performance of devices was limited mainly by moderate charge-transport characteristics of investigated materials.</p><p>Herein, we performed a modification of TBTBT compounds in order to explore the impact of the molecular structure of small molecules on their optoelectronic properties, thermal behavior, texture and morphology of thin films, and as a result charge mobility. We used electron-rich thiophene (T), rigid benzodithiophene (BDT) or more flexible1,4-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzene (TPh) moieties as a central linker. Additionally, terminal thiophene rings were functionalized with tributylsilyl and n-octyl side chains to provide good solubility along with enhanced crystallinity of novel materials in solid state <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , since longer C-Si bond length compared to C-C bond is beneficial to enhance the π-π stacking and planarity of organic semiconductors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> .</p><p>The BDT-containing compounds were shown to be more promising in terms of tuning the morphology upon thermal treatment. Impressive enhancement of hole mobilities by 51.5 times was found for films based on a compound M4 comprising triisopropylsilyl functionalized BDT core. These results provide a favorable experience and strategy for rational design and modification of state-of-the-art OSMs.  The energies of frontier molecular orbitals of synthesized small molecules were estimated by cyclic voltammetry. This allows to additionally evaluate the potential of compounds as semiconductor materials for thin-film electronics. The onset of oxidation potentials was extracted from oxidation waves measured for films of corresponding molecules (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The perovskite absorber material, whereas LUMO energies lie above its conduction band <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that facilitates efficient hole extraction and blocking the transport of electrons, respectively. To get more insight into the morphology of M1-M4 films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out before and after annealing of spin-coated films. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns of as-cast films of M1-M4 and annealed films at 150°C. It is worth noting that the thin ring at all patterns is machine error due to reflection of detector protector film. Surprisingly, the preferential π-π stacking orientation seems absent for all samples. For as-cast M1 film, four wide reflections at 18.8 Å, 11.6 Å, 6.9 Å and 4.6 Å are found indicating the formation of a small defected crystal phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). After annealing, one can see only reflection at 4.3Å typical for an inter-chain distance of alkyl side groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</p><p>Thus, the crystallinity of M1-based films is damaged after annealing that correlates well with changes in the texture of films revealed by POM. The neat M2 films showed a diffraction pattern similar to that of M1 with reflections with d-spacing 17.2 Å, 5.6 Å and 4.5 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>). However, the crystal structure is recovered after annealing revealing a faster crystallization process that is in agreement with POM data. Crystals remain small and imperfect that suggest a high nucleation rate and low growth rate during crystallization from the melt at room temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>). For as-cast film of M3, GIWAXS patterns show narrow intense reflection at 0.039 Å -1 and two broad peaks with d-spacing of 4.6 Å and 3.6 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>). Such pattern was indexed as smectic liquid crystalline (LC) phase with inter-layer distance asm=25.6 Å, which is close to length of conjugated backbone of M3 (approx. 32 Å). After annealing of M3, the smectic peak shifted to smaller angles resulting in increasing asm to 26.3 Å along with increasing intensity of reflection at 3.6 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f</ref>). We suppose that annealing of M3 at 150°C occurs in an LC state that allows to improve the local ordering of conjugated cores.</p><p>A similar structure demonstrated the thin film of M4. The neat film showed a smectic peak at 0.053 Å -1 and oriented crystalline reflections with d-spacing 6.8 Å, 4.6 Å and 3.8 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g</ref>).</p><p>Annealing in the LC state destroyed the crystalline phase keeping phase-separated smectic morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3h</ref>). Such partially-ordered organization formed during processing and posttreatment (deposition method, solvent variation, annealing) can provide larger domains without sharp inter-grain boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . Thus, LC active layer could be preferred compared to amorphous or semi-crystalline ones.</p><p>Next, we investigated the charge-transport characteristics of small molecules M1-M4 using spacecharge limited current method (SCLC) to estimate the impact of structure of small molecules and thermal annealing of thin films on charge mobilities. The hole mobilities were measured in holeonly devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/M1-M4/MoO3/Ag) with the thin films as-cast and annealed at 150°C The detailed procedure is given in Supporting Information and the results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. It can be noted that the variation of central electron donor block in small molecules resulted in remarkable changes in hole mobilities measured for as-cast films. M1 showed highest hole mobility of 4.41×10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 , while h values for benzodithiophene-linked M3 and M4 are significantly lower. Replacing of n-decyl side chains on BDT unit in M3 with triisopropylsilyl substituents in M4 lead to some improving of charge-transport characteristics. As we mentioned above, this fact can be explained by the formation of thin films with liquid-crystalline morphology with phase-separated aliphatic and conjugated blocks. However, higher content of alkyl chains in M3 promotes stronger phase separation of conjugated and non-conjugated parts that weakens the hole transport.</p><p>Thermal treatment of M1 resulted in a decrease in hole mobility by one order of magnitude. This can be explained by the amorphous disordered morphology of M1 films that was supported by POM and GIWAXS data. On the contrary, annealed films based on M2 demonstrated 1.6 times higher h values due to recrystallization after annealing. The films based on both BDT-containing materials exhibited improved charge transport after annealing. Impressive enhancement in hole mobilities from 3.67×10 -5 cm 2 V -1 s -1 to 1.89×10 -3 cm 2 V -1 s -1 was found for M4. These is attributed to better ordering of BDT-based molecules in solid state upon annealing, which was also confirmed by wide-angle X-ray scattering technique and POM measurements. Thus, the structure of central donor linker affords critical control over self-ordering of developed molecules in solid state and consequently their semiconductor properties. Despite the fact that thiophene-linked small molecule M1 exhibited higher hole mobilities, its application in optoelectronic devices operating under realistic conditions (increased temperatures) could result in the deterioration of their performance over time. In this regard, M2 and benzodithiophene-based compound M4 have great potential as semiconductor materials for thin-films electronics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><figDesc>HOMO energies were calculated as HOMO = -𝑒(𝐸 𝑜𝑥 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 + 4.8) eV. It can be clearly seen that HOMO energy levels are influenced by the structure of the central donor block of molecules. The high-lying HOMO level of -4.93 eV was obtained for molecule M2 consisting of the strong electron-donor thiophene-phenylene-thiophene motif in the backbone, while benzodithiophenebased molecule M3 exhibited low-lying HOMO energy of -5.19 eV. The LUMO energies were calculated as Eg+EHOMO. The relative positions of frontier energy levels of designed molecules feature them as electron-donor materials for bulk-heterojunction OSCs, since photo-induced charge transfer could be allowed between M1-M4 and state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptors (Y6, ITIC-4F). Furthermore, small molecules are suitable as hole-transport materials in perovskite solar cells. The HOMO energies of M1-M4 are well aligned with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3</figDesc></figure>
