<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The preliminary results from the first run at ESRF were very encouraging. The most important goal was accomplished: we determined that it is feasible to carry out time-resolved X-ray footprinting experiments at ESRF. X-ray footprinting is a relatively new methodology which was developed at NSLS<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . It is based on the production of hydroxyl radicals by the radiolysis of water caused by the X-rays. These radicals are used to cleave a polynucleotide (either DNA or RNA) at its solvent-accessible sites. If a protein covers the DNA for example it will protect the DNA from cleavage only at those sites that are in contact with the protein. The advantage of using a synchrotron X-ray beam to produce the hydroxyl radicals is that they can be produced fast enough (a few milliseconds) to carry out time-resolved experiments to study the formation of proteinnucleic acids complexes.</p><p>The time required to carry out this reaction at ID9 was about 2-3 ms. At NSLS the exposure time required is more in the order of 20 ms. We have used both hybrid mode and 16 bunch mode (the latter in the presence of both insertion devices) and had similar results, thanks to the helpful staff at the beamline, who also set up an easy way for us to align our sample. The only limiting factor right now for increased time-resolution is the size of the beam (1 x 3 mm), which allows us to expose only one tenth of the sample at a time. However under these conditions we were able to carry out some preliminary time-resolved experiments by placing a stopped-flow apparatus in front of the beam. This stopped-flow controls both the mixing time and exposure time of the sample.</p><p>In our laboratory we are studying the mechanism by which E. coli RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter on the DNA. It is known that this process involves several steps, including a large conformational change, as the protein changes its role from one in which it recognizes a specific DNA sequence and places the active site in the correct position, requiring tight contacts with the DNA, to that of a polymerase which has to be able to quickly slide on the double helix as it carries out the chemical reaction necessary to copy the DNA sequence into a new RNA molecule.</p><p>We are currently using a set of time-resolved techniques that allow us to follow different aspects of the conformational changes that take place during this mechanism.</p><p>The results from the time-resolved X-ray footprinting experiments measuring the rate of formation of the complex (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), are in good agreement with the data we had previously collected in the laboratory using different methods. The advantage of this synchrotron-based technique is that it can give us data of a much higher resolution than the other techniques we have available. X-ray footprinting will allow us to determine exactly where the protein is contacting the DNA at what time, instead of just measuring the rates of global changes. The next step therefore is to increase the quality of our samples, which will allow us to obtain a detailed picture of the different contacts made by the protein (E. coli RNA polymerase) on the DNA in the process of recognition of the promoter and the subsequent changes in conformation that take place during the formation of an active complex.</p><p>In the future this technique can be applied to the studied of the formation of multi-component systems on the DNA, where several proteins regulate the transcriptional activity of a given gene. X-ray footprinting has already been successfully applied to the study of the folding of a large RNA molecule 2 . In addition it can be used to look at the changes in solvent accessibility of the surface of a protein to directly study its changes in conformation and its interaction with other molecules 3 . Another future application of this technique is in vivo footprinting, which will take advantage of the fact that the radicals are produced directly from the water surrounding the macromolecules to be studied and there is no need to add any additional components for the cleavage reaction to take place.
