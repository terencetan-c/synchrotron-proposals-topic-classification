<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Among the volatile elements present in our solar system, iodine is involved in mechanisms of primary importance during planet's evolution. The understanding of iodine's behaviour in terrestrial or extra terrestrial magmas, in present, and past geochemical cycles (magma ocean stages), at deep and shallow levels, is of crucial importance. The different isotopic signatures of 129 Xe/ 132 Xe for mantle and atmosphere between the Earth and Mars may reflect an early fractionation of xenon with respect to iodine. The role of fluids and more especially water is seriously envisaged to generate such a fractionation because whereas iodine is hydrophilic, xenon is not. Therefore iodine's early degassing with a water-rich fluid from a magma ocean is a good hypothesis to explain iodine, but also chlorine and bromine losses during early differentiation stages of the Earth. It was also shown that iodine is involved in natural ozone destruction in the Earth's atmosphere. Today we are able to detect iodine in volcanic emissions. The intensive subduction-zones volcanic degassing may explain the presence of iodine in the atmosphere if degassed together with water.</p><p>This project aims at monitoring iodine's degassing from hydrous silicate magmas during decompression (i.e. magma ascent from depth). Due to the volatile properties of water and iodine, such a study has to be performed at pressure and temperature. The combination of synchrotron X-Ray characterization with diamond anvil cells, applied as magmatic and mantelic reactors to simulate pressure and temperature conditions of the planet interiors allows: (1) the characterization of fluids (aqueous, melt, supercritic) existing in the Earth; (2) element transfers via such fluids from depths to planets surfaces. This experiment was following the experiment EC656 performed at the Id27 beam line in June 2010. We have followed the same strategy in order to experimentally monitored iodine degassing from high pressure hydrous melts in situ in diamond anvil cells DAC by measuring iodine partitioning between aqueous fluids and hydrous melts during decompression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). DAC experiments have been combined with high energy Synchrotron X-Ray Fluorescence, at the FAME beam line. All of the runs were devoted to experiments performed with internally heatted diamond anvil cells IHDAC. We use a magma analogue: haplogranite, and saline solutions containing iodine. We focussed on the pressure and temperature conditions missing after the EC656 experiment in order to complete the set of data we obtained in june.</p><p>This time, partition coefficients (D I fluid/melt = C I fluid /C I melt ) have been measured in situ from 480°C to 735°C and from 0.1 to 1.3 GPa (compared to EC656 conditions : 700 to 910 °C; 0.5 to 1.8 GPa). All of the results show that partition coefficient range from 1.9 to 35. Thanks to the data obtained in FAME we are able to confirm that (1) the partition coefficient tend to be equal to one close to total miscibility between melts and aqueous fluids. (2) At low pressures (&lt; 0.5 GPa) iodine partition coefficients are higher than those of bromine <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bureau et al., 2010,)</ref> for similar pressure and temperature conditions, confirming the stronger affinity of iodine for water during magma degassing.</p><p>These results show that a iodine early magmatic degassing process has possibly generated I fractionation from Xe. They also evidence that for modern volcanism, iodine is efficiently degassed during volcanic eruption, which may be the source of iodine mesaured in the stratosphere and strongly involved in ozone depletion. A publication is in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : central :picture of the sample chamber at pressure and temperature.
