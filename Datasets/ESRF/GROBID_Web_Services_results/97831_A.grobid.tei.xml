<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Amorphous Ge45Cu5Te50 (GCT-9110) exhibits an increased crystallization temperature compared to binary GeTe <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. EXAFS measurements revealed the formation of Cu clusters emebedded and linked to the surrounding Te enriched GeTe matrix in GCT-9110 and also . In order to investigate possible structures of the Cu clusters and the structural effect of the clusters on the amorphous matrix it is necessary to have information not only about the short range order but also about the intermediate and extended range ordering in GCT-9110. This information can be obtained by anomalous x-ray scattering (AXS) which utilizes the change of the dispersion form factors f' and f'' near an absorption edge of an element of the sample to enhance the structural information around this element using the difference of two scattering laws, ΔS(Q).</p><p>The beamtime was divided into two parts. During the first part we used primary energies near the K-edges of Cu, Ge, Ni and near the Te K-edge during the second part. The experimental setup was as proposed. The samples were measured at room temperature under vacuum using a Be-dome to reduce air scattering. The scattered intensity was reflected by a graphite analyzer crystal to discriminate against fluorescence radiation. The detector for the first part was a two dimensional pixel detector with whom it is possible, in combination with the analyzer crystal, to analyze inelastic Compton scattering. This makes it possible to subtract the unwanted Compton intensity from the elastic line.</p><p>For the second part at high energies the detector was changed to a point-detector since the effectivity of the pixel detector strongly decreases at these high energies. Additionally, slits were mounted in front of the detector.</p><p>In the first part we measured successfully the differential structure factors ΔS(Q) at the Cu and the Ge K-edge of the proposed material GCT-9110. Therefor we measured the scattering intensity of the sample (3° &lt; 2θ &lt; 110°) at 8.779 keV and 8.959 keV to obtain ΔSCu(Q) and at 10.903 keV and 11.083 keV to obtain ΔSGe(Q). The primary beam intensity at these energies was much higher than expected, sufficient intensities were collected for one measurement within 1 or 2h. These measurements were also conducted for GCT-7310. Additionally, we changed the primary energy to the Ni K-edge to measure the backup samples GdNi and La55Ni20Al25 before changing to higher primary energies. These samples are metallic glasses which can be rejuvenated by cryogenic treatment changing the mechanical properties strongly. Thus, to understand the effect of the treatment the knowledge of how the amorphous structure changes upon treatment is crucial.</p><p>After finishing the scattering measurements at the low primary energies, the monochromator in the optical hutch was changed from the Si(111) to the Si(311) reflection for the usage of high primary energies. After the mentioned setup changes the primary energy around the Te K-edge was used. We measured the scattering of GCT-9110 at 31.513 keV and 31.783 keV. Since the bunch mode was changed (16b, 35mA beam current) the intensity was lower and longer measurements were scheduled by us. However, the intensity drop was stronger than expected, thus, to meet better statistics the number of points was reduced, the q-range shortened. Nevertheless, the statistics were not entirely satisfactory. For future measurements the 16b mode with 35mA beam current can not be recommended for AXS measurements.</p><p>The resulting ΔS(Q)s of GCT-9110 for each edge are depicted in  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Benedict Paulus*1, Benjamin Klee 1, Wolf-Christian Pilgrim*1, Jens R.

Analysis of the RMC model shows that the Te enriched GeTe matrix of GCT-9110 is built of tetrahedral and defect-octahedral units whereas in comparison with GCT-7310 the fraction of defect-octahedral sites diminshes with increasing Cu content. Furthermore, the RMC simulations indicate the preferred formation of disk-like Cu clusters.Literature[1] Y. Saito, Y. Sutou, J. Koike, J.Phys. Chem., 118, 26973, 2014, 10.1021/jp5066264. [2] B.
