<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the experiment, we performed X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements upon compression of iron alloyed with silicon and carbon up to 120 GPa. The XRD experiments were conducted using the facilities of the ID15B beamline. The high-pressure chambers for the experiment were prepared from Re gaskets. The alloys in the Fe-Si-C system were pre-synthesized at the University of Münster employing piston-cylinder and multi-anvil highpressure apparatuses. The synthesized materials were characterized by the microprobe and diffraction analysis.</p><p>Polycrystalline samples with linear dimensions of ~10x10x10 μm 3 were loaded into the pressure chamber together with the KCl that served as a pressure transmitting medium. Data processing is currently in progress.</p><p>During the diffraction experiment, we measured the pressure dependence of the unit cell volume of hexagona l Fe-1.5 wt % Si-0.2 wt % C alloy up to 100 GPa and of Fe-2 wt % Si-2 wt % C up to 120 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These data will be used to construct the P-V equations of state of these alloys. Laser heating experiments were performed ex-situ employing the facilities of ID18 and later analyzed with diffraction at ID15B. Heating of Fe-1.5 wt % Si-0.2 wt % C, Fe-2 wt % Si-0.4 wt % C and Fe-2 wt % Si-2 wt % C alloys at 20, 40, 60 and 80 GPa and 2400 K GPa lead to decomposition of the corresponding hcp-Fe alloys and formation of Fe3C and facecentered (fcc) iron-silicon-carbon alloy (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) which retained to 20 GPa upon decompression. We also determined the P-V equations of states of the run products upon decompression. The recovered samples are currently being analyzed by the microprobe for their full chemical characterization.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.
