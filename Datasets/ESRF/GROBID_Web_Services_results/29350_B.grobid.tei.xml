<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The macroscopic properties of aqueous foam as ageing behaviour or rheological properties are a very important topic for a large variety of industrial applications such as food processing, firefighting or mineral flotation. Our research consists in studying these properties at different scales in the foam (i.e. film scale as well as bubble or whole foam scale) in order to correlate them each other. The experiments presented here are a sequel of previous ones using small angle neutron scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> (LLB and IFF) and small angle X-ray scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (ID02, ESRF). During these previous experiments it has appeared that it was possible to perform neutron or X-ray reflectivity on films of a three dimensional aqueous foam. The aim of these new measurements is to analyse the signal of an individual film and to correlate it with the data obtained for a foam. Two kinds of samples have been studied: a well-known surfactant (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) with a concentration (12 g.L -1 ) far above its critical micellar concentration and an amphiphilic protein (egg ovalbumin).</p><p>These experiments have been performed on BM26B beamline with an XY detector, the wavelength was 0.954 Å and the sample to detector distance was either 1.5 m (i.e the Q range was 0.0107 to 0.2313 Å -1 ) or 2.5 m (i.e. the Q range was 0.0008 to 0.1614 Å -1 ). In order to prepare our samples we have used a little solution volume (around 0.5 mL). With a syringe we put some air bubbles into a 4 mm diameter Kapton ® tube to obtain a "bamboo" foam described by an assembly of regularly spaced parallel films (distance between two films, 2 mm). The tube was then mounted on a sample holder and a goniometric head allowing micrometric shifts.</p><p>We have observed for the first time an anisotropic signal for a single flat film. The figure 1 illustrating an intensity versus Q curve shows distinct oscillations. This shape is described by the specular Xray reflectivity theory and the periodicity of the oscillations is directly related to the film thickness (here 280 Å). We have followed the time evolution of this film, from a wet state to a dry one, and the thickness decreases down to 190 Å (this value is in agreement with the previous ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> ). We interpret this signal as being a specular reflectivity signature for a slightly curved interface. It corresponds to a small angle distribution for a thin film. For "bamboo" foam, the film is almost flat ; in the neighbourhood of the Plateau borders (the link between the film to the tube) it is bending progressively. Then the contribution of Plateau borders is negligible because of their high thickness (in comparison with the wavelength) and their large curvature hindering any interference phenomenon. We also changed the angle between the beam and the film and the result of this step (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) confirms the reflectivity signature. Namely changing the angle in a sufficiently narrow range does not modify the shape of the intensity. We clearly see that the positions of the oscillations remain quite the same. The little shift, inducing a little change in the film thickness during these measurements, is attributed to the film drainage (due to gravity and capillary suction).</p><p>In a second step we have compared the signal obtained for the upper and the lower sides of a film. The figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> presents the data of the same investigated film with two angles of +0.5° and -0.5°. The signal corresponding to the lower side of the film is not as well defined as the one obtained for the upper side. This result opens the question of the film symmetry which will be one of our next investigations.</p><p>In comparison with previous neutron scattering studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> we have measured the X-ray signal of a three dimensional foam, using the same set-up (30 mm inner diameter cylinder with Kapton ® windows). We have compared the shape of the intensity obtained by a radial integration of the anisotropic signal with the one obtained by the integration along two independent spikes (figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). As expected we interpret the intensity of the whole foam as being an average of all the spikes. The extracted thickness corresponds to a global behaviour of the foam hiding some structural information. For example, the intensity of the spike labelled 2 has a different shape as the spike 1 and the oscillation positions are different. We will expect to pursue these experiments to follow the thinning kinetics and the distribution inside surfactant foams and also for protein ones.</p><p>Finally we also carried out experiments on egg ovalbumin films. The data are still under treatment but it has appeared the spectra resulting from the angle variations are totally different from the SDS ones (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). For such samples other complex phenomena have to be taken into account and we plan to perform some new measurements with better controlled physico-chemical parameters.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: typical shape of the signal measured Figure 2: variations of the angle between the film and the beam. for a SDS foam film (insert : XY pattern).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,294.84,369.90,265.23,167.34" type="bitmap" /></figure>
