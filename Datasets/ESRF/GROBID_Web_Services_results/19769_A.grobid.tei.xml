<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Results expected Determination of the strains in the surface shell layers in SiC nanocrystals as a function of grain size and chemical composition (environment) of the surface. Effect of size on the structure of grain cores. Materials: For the purpose of making comparative studies 3 kinds of nanocrystalline powders were used: SiC ( average crystallite size 10 and 20 nm), diamond (6 and 10 nm), GaN (6 and 30 nm). Experiment: The diffraction data was collected in transmission geommetry with application of 4 scintillation counters and secondary beam monochromators, λ~ 0.5 Å, room-temperature. Silicon standard was used to callibrate the instrument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method of data elaboration</head><p>We investigated the effect of the chemical state of the surface of the nanoparticles on the relaxation in the near-surface layer with application of a method of determination of apparent lattice parameter, alp, measured for different diffraction vectors Q [1,2]. Apparent lattice parameter is the lattice parameter determined taking into account a particular (limited) part of the diffraction pattern. It appears that at low diffraction vectors the Bragg peak positions are affected by the structure of the near-surface layer while at high Q only the interior of the nano-grain shows. Following the measurements on raw (as prepared) powders we investigated powders cleaned (annealed at 400 o C) under vacuum and those wetted by water. Subsequent alp-Q plots have shown that the structure of the surface layer changed with the of treatment of the sample. Semi quantitative analysis was based on the comparison of experimental and theoretical alp-Q plots. Theoretical alp-Q plots were obtained from diffraction patterns calculated for models of nanocrystals with strained surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A strong dependence of experimental alp-Q plots on grain size was observed for all examined samples. Also dependence of alp values on purity of materials and its surrounding was observed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nanocrystalline silicon carbide SiC. Raw nanocrystalline SiC powders show a strong increase of measured alp values at small Q-values, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. There is much stronger increase of alp values measured for 8 nm powder than for larger grains 20 nm.</p><p>According to theoretical calculations, this shape of alp-Q plots corresponds to a core-shell model of nanocrystals where the atomic structure of the surface shell is similar to that in the grain core but it is expanded -its under tension.</p><p>The estimated thickness of the shell is 4-6 Å, the strain is around 10%. Annealing of powders at 400 o C in vacuum leads to a strong decrease of the surface strain: theoretical calculations show that the initial tensile strain in the surface becomes significantly smaller and shows a tendency to convert in compressive strain (note that the measured alp values are smaller than the lattice parameter of a relaxed SiC lattice). The shape of alp-Q plot changes again when the powder is wetted by water. This is obviously the effect of changes of surface energy (surface tension) of SiC due to interaction with strongly polar water molecules.</p><p>Nanocrystalline GaN Raw powder of 6 nm nanocrystalline GaN shows a decrease of alp values measured at low Q. This shape of the plot corresponds to a core-shell model of nanocrystal with a compressed surface shell. The estimated thickness of the shell is around 7Å, the strain is 10-15%. Annealing of the powder leads to a very strong change of measured alp values suggesting complete reconstruction of the atomic structure of the surface. The increase of alp above the lattice parameter of the relaxed lattice suggests that in the surface shell, there is a combination of tensile and compressive strains.</p><p>Nanocrystalline diamond Raw powder of 10 nm nanocrystalline diamond shows an increase of alp values al low Q, what demontrates presence of tensile strain in the surface shell. Evaluated thickness of the shell is 4-5Å, the strain is around 5%. After annealing of the powder the strain disappears.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and conclusion</head><p>The alp-Q plots demonstrate a strong dependence of the structure of the surface shells of all examined materials. At large Q, above 10-12 [1/Å] the measured alp values correspond to lattice parameters of relaxed lattices (that measured for bulk crystals). This is a clear indication that there is no internal pressure generated in the interior of the grains, although there are very strong strains present in the surface of nanocrystals.
