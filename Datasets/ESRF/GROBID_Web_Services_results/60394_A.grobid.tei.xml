<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of this experiment was to capture the migration of Mn in the LiMnO2 structure as it occurs during operation in a bespoke lithium ion cell. We manufactured suitable cells based on the Swagelok union fitting with a custom-made PEEK central piece that accomodates a cell with a diameter of around 1 mm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>). This narrow geometry was required to achieve a high signal to noise ratio during the XRD experiments. This cell was then cycled whilst taking 2D high-speed XRD measurements (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>), hence simultaneous electrochemical measurements and XRD were carried out. Before and after each cycle, 3D XRDCT scans captured a slice of the entire electrode (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>) to monitor the spatial and temporal degradation of the LiMnO2 electrodes. In total, we successfully imaged 3 x LiMnO2 cells for between 2 and image using high resolution XRDCT ex-situ, the results of which will contribute to building a map of the short-term as well as long-term degradation effects observed in Li-ion batteries.</p><p>In addition to the LiMnO2 cells, we imaged one cell with a Si-graphite composite electrode. Utilising the high speed point XRD capability of ID15, we constructed an experiment where during charging a different electrochemical potential would be achieved between the Si and graphite particles. Hence, when the cell is switched to open circuit (OCV), the Si and graphite would continue to communicate via transfer of Li ions. Imaging at 100 Hz, we hope to capture this communication at open circuit and show that equilibration periods need to be considered in composite electrodes.</p><p>At ID15 we achieved a 1 Âµm resolution point XRD scans as well as 3D XRDCT recontrustions. Using the Pilatus Dectris CdTe 2M detector, we were also able to achieve measurements at up to 100 Hz at 75 keV monochromatic beam. This capability cannot be achieved anywhere else, making this experiment stand out as a technological precipice. The preliminary images shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> are demonstrative of the success of this experiment. The crytalline particle features are clearly observed and, for the first time, sub-particle spatial XRD information can be extracted. The unique high flux and high energy capability of ID15, as well as the skills of Marco Di Michiel and Antony Vamvakeros, made this proposed experiment possible. Based on the resultes observed so far, we expect one or more high impact publications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Swagelok union-inspired cell design with a PEEK core.
