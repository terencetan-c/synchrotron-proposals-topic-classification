<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Pure N 2 and pure H 2 systems have been extensively studied under pressure. These are model systems for studying the effects of pressure on chemical bonding. Interesting phases have been observed, such as the formation of 'black hydrogen' <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the formation of non-molecular poly-nitrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The observation of the pressure-induced metallization in these two systems remains a challenge, however the study of N 2 /H 2 mixtures under pressure is a potentially promising next step toward this goal. Studies of such mixtures open the possibility for a rich array of chemical effects that are not evident by examination of the end-member components alone: existence of stoichiometric compounds; binary chemical reactivity in the solid solutions and possible new routes to the pressure induced metallization of N 2 /H 2 systems. Binary mixtures of N 2 and H 2 with rare gases have already been studied, disclosing two van der Waals compounds, Ar(H 2 ) 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, proposed as a new mechanism for the metallization of hydrogen, and (N 2 ) 11 He <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which shows a structural evolution useful for understanding that of pure solid N 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The understanding of the interplay between the pressure-induced chemistry and the various microscopic arrangements has the potential to lead to the synthesis of very interesting solids, including metallic forms of N 2 /H 2 and/or polymeric forms of nitrogen doped with hydrogen.</p><p>We measured the N 2 /H 2 binary phase diagram at 296 K by visual observation and Raman spectroscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Our results suggested the existence of two N 2 /H 2 compounds with visually distinct morphologies under optical microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). The motivation for this proposal was thus to characterize these newly identified compounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>Six shifts were requested and awarded on ID09 in order to characterize single-crystal samples of the two apparent compounds at high pressure and to determine their structure by means of single-crystal x-ray diffraction. In particular, we aimed to examine the following: -To identify whether the apparent N 2 /H 2 compounds shared structural similarities with the corresponding end-member solid structures. -Evaluate the pressure-volume equation of state of these structures. -Examine the possible integration of H 2 into the N 2 lattice and any possible pressure-induced reactivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Technique</head><p>Three samples were prepared in our laboratory in wide-aperture (35° cone) membrane diamond anvil cells (MDAC). These were equipped with 150 and 300 µm culet Almax-Boehler anvils. Single crystals were grown by pressurization at room temperature from N 2 /H 2 mixtures prepared with concentrations of 60% H 2 and 70% H 2 , near the condtions under which the compounds were observed in our lab. The ruby luminescence scale was used to determine pressure.</p><p>Angle-dispersive single-crystal diffraction was be carried out using a monochromatic beam (~0.4 Å) focused to 15-30 μm. The samples were were rotated about a vertical axis from -29° to 29° to take advantage of the wide cell aperture while not contaminating the CCD with scattering from the experimental apparatus. Images were be collected in steps of 0.5° using the online MAR555 detector. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Two of the three samples performed well and yielded good-quality single-crystal diffraction patterns. Though very high-quality data is challenging to collect on such weakly scattering (low-Z) materials, we were able to extract structural information for both of the compounds. We identify them as (N 2 ) 6 (H 2 ) 7 (R-3m) and N 2 (H 2 ) 2 (Pm-3m). In the first case, the structural solutions converge sufficiently well to allow placement of the hydrogen molecules by calculation of the charge distribution and the known stoichiometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). In the case of the cubic structure, N 2 (H 2 ) 2 , peak broadening due to apparent disorder of the N 2 molecules in the lattice complicates the analysis, though it appears likely that the compound shares a structural resemblance to that of pure N 2 at the same pressure.</p><p>Though we hoped to carry out equation of state measurements with a third sample equipped for higher pressures, we were unable to carry out these measurements beyond 45 GPa due to a poorly formed crystalline sample. Though we attempted to melt and regrow the crystal in-situ as well as transform the sample to a powder by rapid pressurization, neither attempt resulted in sufficiently high-quality spectra and the remaining beamtime was dedicated to obtaining the best possible structural data below 10 GPa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The (N 2 ) 6 (H 2 ) 7 compound identified at 54% H 2 concentration presents a novel structure very different from that of pure N 2 . As shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>, hydrogen molecules (gray) are confined by chain or tube-like arrangements of N 2 . This structure thus presents intriguing possibilities for examining the pressure-induced metallization of H 2 by confinement as well as the possible facilitation of poly-N by pre-arrangement of the N 2 molecules in a quasi-linear fashion. Additional studies are underway to characterize these compounds more fully, though the structural data obtained at ID09 has been tremendously important for the synthesis of this project.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>le-Chatel DPTA-SPMC Centre DIF F -91297 BRUYERES-LE-CHATEL CEDEX</figDesc></figure>
