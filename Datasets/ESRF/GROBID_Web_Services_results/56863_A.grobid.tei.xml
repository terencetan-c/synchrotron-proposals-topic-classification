<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective &amp; expected results</head><p>Hydrotreating catalysts consist of molybdenum sulfide slabs promoted by nickel (or cobalt) and supported on an oxide (alumina, silica-alumina, etc.). The aim of this study was to lead to a detailed description of the multi-scale structure of MoS 2 sulfide catalysts thanks to ASAXS measurements. These results should help us to understand the role of various parameters such as the surface and textural characteristics of the support, but also of the synthesis and sulfidation conditions, on the arrangement of the sulfide slabs. Using the ASAXS technique close to the Mo K-edge should help us to characterize the length of the sulfide slabs but also their organization (stacking, aggregation, dispersion) inside the porosity of the alumina support. The data analysis is supported by various simulation of scattered intensity performed on molecular models and by complementary techniques such as HR-STEM that allows visualizing the geometry of the MoS 2 slabs. Thanks to these characterizations, issues of interest will be addressed such as: i) the impact of the alumina properties (surface chemistry, crystallite size, pore distribution) on the sulfide slabs (size, stacking, aggregation and spatial repartition) ii) the effect of the organic additive and the amount of molybdenum (suspected to be antagonist) on the aggregation, iii) the differences generated between a gas and a liquid sulfidation, iv) the possible synergy between these synthesis conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</head><p>16 catalysts and 2 alumina supports were analyzed varying the support (γ/ δ-alumina), the sulfidation environment (gas/ liquid), the presence of organic additives (with/without) and the amount of molybdenum oxide (8%/22% wt). ASAXS experimentations were recorded slightly below the Mo K-edge, at 6 different energies <ref type="bibr">: 19700, 19860, 19940, 19975, 19990 and 19999</ref> eV. As we wanted the largest q-domain as possible (typically between 10 -2 and 1 A -1 ), two detector/sample distances were used (1m and 30cm). The samples, in powder form, were analyzed in capillaries, using the sample changer. As a first step, the curves of intensity measured for the 6 energies were substracted two by two in order to obtain the intensity scattered by the sulfide slabs and to minimize the contribution of the porous support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Information obtained from the ASAXS data. First, we have shown that ASAXS is totally suitable to characterize the sulfide active phase of this kind of catalyst as it gives information on the size of the slabs and the size of their stacks and aggregates. The exploitation of the ASAXS data was successfully helped by the simulation of scattered intensity performed with an home-made software <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and from molecular models obtained by DFT calculations (see figures 1, 2 and 3).   The q-scale can be divided into two parts: (i) the large q that are related to the scale of the slabs : the intensity depends on the size of the slabs and on their stacking, (ii) the low q that are related to the cluster/aggregate of the slabs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results</head><p>The quantity of information is significant so the main results are presented on figures 4 and 5.</p><p>-Effect of the organic additive: At low amount of molybdenum (8% wt of MoO 3 ) and for a gas sulfidation, on gamma alumina, it is observed (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, curves n°3 and 4) that the slabs are significantly smaller in the absence of organic additive. This is not so obvious when performing a liquid sulfidation on the same sample (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, curves n°5 and 6). At large scale and so at smaller q, it seems that the shape and the size of the aggregates of slabs are not impacted by the presence of organic additive. At high amount of molybdenum (22% wt of MoO 3 ), for both kind of sulfidation, it seems that the organic additive does not affect the size of the slabs (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, curves n° 13 and 14 and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, curves n°11 and 12). However, some changes are observed on the aggregates scale for the gas sulfidation, but not for the liquid sulfidation: the aggregates or clusters of the sulfide slabs seem to be bigger when using an organic addtive. To resume, it appears that the effect of the organic additive is not trivial : it depends on the sulfidation conditions, but also on the amount of molybdenum. The size of the slabs is higher in the presence of additive, and the size of the aggregates seems to be also higer when performing a liquid sulfidation. These results are in good agreement with characterization performed by high resolution scanning transmission electron micrsocopy (HR-STEM).</p><p>-Effect of the amount of molybdenum: The effect of the amount of molybdenum is also not very obvious and depends on the other parameters : After a gas sulfidation (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), in the absence of organic additive, increasing the amount of Mo allows to increase the size of the slabs and to keep constant the size of the aggregates. On the contrary, the size and/or shape of the aggregates seeems to be changed in the presence of addtive. After a liquid sulfidation (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), whatever the presence or absence of additive, the increase of amount of Mo does not modify the size of the slabs but does impact their aggregation.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>At first sight, the influence of the sulfidation conditions (gas or liquid) is not significant on gamma alumina as the curves are not very different, whatever the amount of Mo or the presence of additive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives</head><p>For instance, these observations are only qualitatives. Consequently, the exploitation of the data should be performed basing on the scattering theory. The slabs will be modelled by discs or thin ellipsoids and the aggregates could be, at first approximation, modelled by ellipsoids. The results will be compared with the ones obtained by electron microscopy. Let's precise that the results are very interesting and allow to imagine lot of perspectives as the ASAXS technique, that nowadays is not used on these kinds of samples, is very complementary to the electron microscopy but can also go further in the characterization, bringing information on the aggregation of the slabs, which is suspected to affect significantly the catalytic properties of the catalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.):</head><p>The allocated shifts were divided into three sessions : the first session of 2 shifts was used to validate and to set up the experiment: optimisation of the acquisition conditions, choise of the energies, creation of the macros that control the sample changer. The second session was used to record the data at the first detector/sample distances. And finnally, after the manual change of distance and so the set up of the beamline, the third session has consisted in recording the data at this short distance. This global beamtime was necessary to success recording good data as the anomalous experiments with 6 different energies is not trivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication(s):</head><p>-Publication under progress.</p><p>-The results have been proposed for a presentation at the international congress MACS7 "7th International Symposium on Molecular Aspects of Catalysis by Sulfides".</p></div>			</div>
