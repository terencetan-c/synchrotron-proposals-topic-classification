<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>This experiment represents the initial part of a long project that aims at elucidating the binding mode and the structure of the Prep1-Pbx1-HoxB1-DNA complex. Indeed, the protein Prep1 in complex with its binding partner Pbx1 and possibly also with HoxB1 acts as tumor suppressor by interacting with DNA. In parallel with X-ray crystallography studies that, once obtained the crystals, will elucidate the structure of the complex, SAXS is used to clarify the Prep1/Pbx1 interactions and the DNA binding architecture in solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY WORK</head><p>SAXS datasets of the binary (Prep1-Pbx1 ~ 73 kDa) and the ternary (Prep1-Pbx1-DNA ~ 90 kDa) complexes have been collected at ESRF (ID14-3). Both the complexes with and without DNA appear to be soluble, homogeneous and suitable for SAXS. In addition from my SAXS data it seems that Prep1-Pbx1 complex undergoes some shape rearrangement upon binding DNA. Due to the conformational change after DNA binding, I did not obtain a satisfactory model from MONSA multiphase reconstruction. Although the quality of my SAXS data allows me to obtain ab initio models of the two complexes, due to the limitation of SAXS method, I am not able to distinguish in my models the DNA from the protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>SAXS datasets of the binary (Prep1-Pbx1 ~ 75 kDa) and the ternary (Prep1-Pbx1-DNA ~ 87 kDa) complexes have been already collected at ESRF (ID14-3). Both the complexes with and without DNA are soluble, monodisperse and suitable for SAXS. Although Prep1-Pbx1 binary complex at higher concentrations tends to aggregate, data can be collected free from interparticle effects from low concentrations (approx 0.5 mg/ml) estimated from the change in Rg, Dmax , and Volume (table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>protein concentration Rg (nm) Dmax (nm) Volume (nm 3 ) mW (kDa) expected mW (kDa) Prep1Pbx1 7 mg/ml 5,77 19,60 311 194 75 3.5 mg/ml 4,88 17,01 203 127 75 0.6 mg/ml 4,23 14,30 174 109 75 Prep1Pbx1 + DNA 14 mg/ml 4,30 15,25 162 101 87 7 mg/ml 4,30 15,24 160 100 87 3.5 mg/ml 4,30 15,00 158 98 87 1.8 mg/ml 4,30 15,00 155 97 87 Table 1: Summary of SAXS parameters calculated with Primus and Gnom (ATSAS 2.4 package).The SAXS data provided ab initio models (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) of the two complexes and although they overlay it is not possible to adequately distinguish the position of the DNA relative to the protein as the reconstruction from Prep1-Pbx1-DNA complex is affected by the density differences between protein and DNA. Multiphase reconstruction from this data was also inconclusive probably due to conformational changes upon DNA binding.</p></div>		</body>
