<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Epitaxial growth of Fe on a stepped Cu(111) surface leads to the formation of stripes if the coverage is less than 1.5 monolayer (ML) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Therefore this "self organized" system allows us to produce easily magnetic 1D nanostructure which are of great potential. Actually the sensitivity of the XMCD technique on ID12B allowed us a study far below the 1D percolation in the ~5% of a monolayer thickness range where the clusters are made of few hundred atoms.</p><p>In order to make a correlation with the previous result on this system obtained with Kerr effect <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> we plot in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>  Using the specificity of the XMCD and the high sensitivity at ID12B we determine the magnetic moments using the sum rules. Due to the very small coverage considered in our experiment we expect an increase of the orbital magnetic moment (P / ) and the spin moment (P 6 ) due to the isolated atoms effect.</p><p>More, correlated to the 1D and 2D percolation we can also expect some slight structural changes in the fcc Fe parameters which can lead to some modification of P 6 . In order to be sensitive to these changes we plot P / and P 6 in figure 2 rather than the ratio P / /P 6 . Assuming uniaxial anisotropy, we use Bruno's model describing the orbital magnetic moment We tentatively ascribe these features to some slight changes in the Fe atomic volume taking place at these morphological transformation, as it is well known that such change can drastically modify the γ-Fe</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">magnetic properties [2].</formula></div>

Effectif spin moment (include the magnetic dipole term) and orbital magnetic moment for Fe/Cu(111) deduce from the XMCD spectra using the sum rules. We can see from this plot that P / show the expected behavior with an increase of 100% for the lowest coverage compared to the 2D value. However surprisingly we found for the coverage's below 1ML an in-plane contribution for the magnetic anisotropy, and even if it goes to fully polar above 1 ML this result is quite different from the Kerr experiment where a strict polar anisotropy is observed in the full fcc thickness range, i.e. below ~2.5 ML. This discrepancy is certainly due to the highest sensitivity of XMCD. But we still do not know if our observation is due to a quenched anisotropy or a mixing of domains with polar and in-plane anisotropy.</p><p>But the more striking result come from the spin moment indeed it shows very important features which are correlated with the morphological transition, i.e. decrease of P 6 at the 1D percolation and increase when the film reach the 2D percolation.</p><p>0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 P 6 eff (µ B ) Thickness (ML) 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 P / (Fe bcc ) ' SHUFRODWLRQ ' SHUFRODWLRQ P / (pol) P / (//) moment (µ B ) 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 P 6 (Fe bcc ) P / (µ B )</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>1DPHV DQG DIILOLDWLRQV RI DSSOLFDQWV (* indicates experimentalists): Ph.
