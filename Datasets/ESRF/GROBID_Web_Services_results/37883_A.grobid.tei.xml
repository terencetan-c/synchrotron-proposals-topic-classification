<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In situ real-time tomography of fuel cell diffusion layers under hydrodynamic flow conditions </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment consisted of two logical parts which were investigated independently. Since the experiment is non-standard, it was in the first place required to optimize the experimental parameter set in order to find the best trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. The occurrence of artifacts reduces (and hence the spatial resolution increases) with the number of projections, while the temporal resolution decreases. Furthermore, the distance between detector and sample needs to be optimized with regard to the image contrast. The use of potassium iodide (KJ) salts as a tracer was tested also to increase the contrast. In the second part of the experiment, water was pumped through the sample and the tomograms where taken as a time series.</p><p>The Optimization Experiment included the variation of the beam energy (20.5 keV and 33.4 keV), the use of KJ as a contrast agent to enhance the absorption contrast and the detector distance (10 mm, 20 mm and 40 mm) for optimized edge enhancement due to phase contrast. The test specimen was Toray 060 with 7% PTFE, pre-saturated. The sample diameter was 3 mm in all cases.</p><p>The Comparison of the Different Detector to Sample Distances are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The contrast between fibers and fluid-phase is fairly poor for a distance of 10 mm, it improves at a distance of 20 mm. At 40 mm, the transition between fiber and fluid phase is over pronounced and the number of artifacts increases significantly. For further experiments, the distance 20 mm was chosen.</p><p>The Energy and Tracer Variation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Two energies (20.5 keV and 33.4 keV) had been tested with and without KJ as a tracer. It turned out that the contrast is reduced at the higher energy. The reason is the reduced flux density of the beam at this high photon energy and decreased detector efficiency. The use of contrast agent did not improve the contrast significantly, therefore it was abandoned.  The Flow Experiment was performed under conditions shown in Table 1. Parameter Value Unit Beam Energy 20.5 KeV Distance detector -sample 20 Mm Number of projections 800 Time resolution 90 S Spatial Resolution 2.8 µm Water flow rate: 3 µl/min Corresp. current density 17.7 A/cm² Water pressure 4 -12 kPa Sample diameter 3 mm</p><p>The experimental setup is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The sample was mounted in a PTFE tube with silicon foam sealing and a filter paper above the top sealing. The function of the filter paper was to avoid accumulation of water on the low pressure side. This is supposed to be a variable in a later experiment to study the influence of the boundary condition on the water inside the diffusion media. The flow rate was set to 6 µl/min and the sample diameter was 3 mm.</p><p>The data from the second experiment shows the same location within the 3D dataset at six successive time steps (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Each tomogram took 90 s (30 s for the image taking and 60 s for the data storage). 90 s elapsed between two consecutive images. It was found that the shape of the individual water "filaments" changes during the experiment. The data had been segmented automatically by threshold setting. The porosity of the dry fiber structure of the depictured section was 87.5% ± 1.62% (three standard deviations) and the saturation 23.8% ± 3.14 %.</p><p>The standard deviation for the porosity is a quality measure for the segmentation algorithm (based on the fibers). The larger standard deviation of the saturation is based on the fact that the water is flowing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result</head><p>The demonstrated spatial resolution allows us to resolve the fibers, as well as the interface between water and air due to the phase contrast. The time resolution demonstrated in this work, enables the study of the dynamic three dimensional evolution of liquid water structures inside the carbon fiber structure which is unique to this experiment. The contrast of the images obtained is sufficient to perform automated image analysis to separate the water and the fibers from the original image. All these properties enable the visual investiagtion of slow flow processes in porous substrates, particularly usefull for investigation of fuel cells. The influence of different porous material treatments on distribution patterns under flow can be studied with the choosen setup. The results also indicate the clear prospect that in the future the time-dependent 3D water distribution of running fuel cells could be investigated in situ.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Lukas Helfen*, ANKA, Karlsruhe, Germany Armin Schneider*, Adam Opel GmbH, Rüsselsheim, Germany Dr. Christian Wieser*, Adam Opel GmbH, Rüsselsheim, Germany Jörg Roth*, Adam Opel GmbH, Rüsselsheim, Germany</figDesc></figure>
