<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main goal of this experiment was to apply Coherent X-ray Diffractive Imaging (CXDI) in the hard X-ray regime on unstained freeze-dried and frozen-hydrated cells, especially of Dictyostelium Discoideum. This implied testing the relevant preparation techniques as well as the specially designed sample environment. As the application of CXDI to biological specimens in the hard X-ray regime has not been performed before, questions of feasibilty, required dose as well as achievable resolutions were also addressed. In addition, a new approach towards the problem of parasitic aperture scattering in CXDI was tested by generating a rotationally symmetric illumination function, which yields a highly localized far-field diffraction pattern in order to isolate scattering contributions from the sample, which fill the whole q-range. In the first part of the experiment a multi-pinhole illumination function was generated by placing a system of three circular apertures (Pt, thickness 100-200m,  = 5-10m) into the mirror-focused monochromatic undulator beam of the ID10C end station. Our simulations had shown before that the generation of highly localized intensity distribution in the detector plane is feasible with a system of three pinholes, increasing in diameter towards the sample, so that one pinhole cuts into the first or second Airy minimum of the preceding one suppressing higher-order contributions. Unfortunatelly, in contrast to our previous experience and although all pinholes had been prepared very carefully by Focused Ion Beam polishing, the far-field diffraction pattern even of a single pinhole was strongly distorted by non-isotropic contributions in the exiting wave-field.</p><p>Similarly, strong distortions of the wavefront by the monochromator and focusing mirrors were observed in pinhole line scans through the incoming wavefield and have most probably contributed -in combination with partial coherence effects and the small distance of the sample from the optical elements -to the non-ideal scattering from the pinhole apertures. The localization of the far-field diffraction pattern was partly achieved (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), however, it is concluded here that designing a special illumination function to separate the scattering from the sample and the illuminating aperture should be experimentally possible, but needs individual investigation and highly optimized conditions to provide a better plane-wave illumination of the aperture system. No ice crystals are visible in the optical microscopy image suggesting a successful vitrification. This is supported also by a speckle size similar to the case of freeze-dried cells. An angular integration in the lower right quadrant of the right graph shows that the descrease of intensity at high scattering angles can be described by a power law (~q -3.1(1) ).</p><p>As a consequence the optical setup was changed, i.e. the focusing mirrors were removed and two pairs of rectangular polished slits were inserted into the beam path (beam defining aperture was 10x10m 2 ). Sample cells had been prepared by rapid freezing in liquid ethane on thin Kapton films (d = 10-20m) mounted on metal holders (MiTeGen, USA) and could be visualized in-situ during the experiment by an on-axis microscope (Accel, Germany), mounted coaxial with the beam path (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Now smaller and more localized freeze-dried cells of the procaryotic species deinococcus radiodurans were introduced into the beam (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). As visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> the smaller cell size allowed for sufficient oversmapling with a speckle size of 3-5 pixels, yielding a cell size of ca. 2-5m, which is very consistent with the optical micrographs. In summary, it could be shown that unstained prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells could be prepared in freezedried and frozen-hydrated state and reciprocal space data could be collected in the relevant q-space up to an angle of q = 50 m -1 yielding a real-space half-period of ca 60 nm. From an extrapolation of the algebraically decaying scattering intensity it could be concluded that a resolution of 10 nm would require a total flux of 10 10 photons at 12 keV. This is an important experimental result towards answering the question of an optimum wavelength to minimize the dose at a given resolution. It was shown that biological specimens act as nearly pure phase objects at 8keV photon energy and a resolution of 50nm and higher with hard X-ray CDI on unstained biological materials should feasible. Reconstruction attempts based on iterative procedures have not been successful yet mainly due to reasons of lacking q-data and partial coherence. However, by combination with the optical images from the in-situ-microscope this might become possible.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Klaus Giewekemeyer*, Sebastian Kalbfleisch*, André Beerlink*, and Tim Salditt* Institut für Röntgenphysik, Friedrich-Hund-Platz 1, 37077 Göttingen</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1: Experimental setup used for multi-pinhole coherent diffractive imaging on biological cells. The pinhole positions were controlled by 8 translation stages with tens of nm accuracy (cf. lower right inset). Using an optical microscope (Accel/Maatel, Germany/France) with a drilled lens the sample on a thin Kapton holder (MiTeGen, USA) could be monitored during the experiment with 1m resolution. The detector was placed 2.75 m away from the sample and was protected by a circular beamstop (different sizes were available) mounted on Kapton films on a motorized in-vacuo-stage. The diffraction pattern (lower left inset, absolute value of difference of diffraction with and without the sample) was collected by illuminating a group of freeze-dried Dictyostelium cells (cf. middle inset). Although the scattering signal from the beam-defining apertures could be restricted to a certain q-range and speckles outside this range from the sample are visible, the pinhole scattering should have been much more localized according to simulations based on numerical Fresnel propagation.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,43.50,419.70,496.20,230.10" type="bitmap" /></figure>
