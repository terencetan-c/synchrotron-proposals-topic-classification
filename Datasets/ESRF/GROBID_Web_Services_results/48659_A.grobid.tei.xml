<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Real-time monitoring of diffuse x-ray scattering: Measuring in-plane length scales of binary organic semiconductors In this study, we have investigated the growth of two popular organic semiconductors, particularly Pentacene (C 22 H 14 , PEN) and Diindenoperylene (C 32 H 16 , DIP), as pure and mixed films on SiOx. As stated in the proposal, we are interested in how the film morphology changes during growth of blends with different mixing ratios and substrate temperatures. All films were grown in a portable UHV-chamber with a base pressure better than 10 10 9 -× mbar. During the deposition of molecules we followed the growth by taking grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) snapshots every few seconds. The sample was then post-growth characterized via X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) to check for consistency with our in-house ex situ measurements and to exclude a time-dependent reorganization of molecules. Films were grown in a consistent manner, at substrate temperatures of 30°C and 100°C, respectively. The composition of the mixture was changed in the range PEN:DIP 4:1, …1:1, …1:4. In situ GISAXS-, XRR-and GIXD-measurements were performed with the Maxipix detector. Since the data analysis is still in progress, we present only some preliminary findings.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> shows the molecular orientation of the two compounds PEN and DIP within their respective unit cell. As shown in previous studies, both materials favour an intermixed rather than a phase seperated molecular arrangement. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> a typical XRR-scan for a PEN1:DIP3-mixture is presented. Pronounced Kiessig oscillations indicate a relatively smooth film growth. Bragg-reflections are measured up to the second order. Both Bragg peaks are accompanied by corresponding Laue oscillations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> shows two snaphots of the GISAXS real-time data, taken at 1.5 monolayer (ML) and 2.5 ML coverage for the mixing ratio PEN1:DIP4, respectively. The main features in the images are a bright central spot, which corresponds to the specular reflection and two side-streaks, due to diffuse scattering of the system. The incident angle of the beam was chosen such that the specular point coincides with the anti-Bragg condition. Due to the large dynamic range of the Maxipix detector we were able to capture the weak diffuse signal without saturating the pixels in the specular spot. Since the absolute intensities in the specular and diffuse maxima differ by several orders of magnitude, these real-time experiments are challenging. The distance between both streaks, i.e. || q ∆ , changes during the film growth, indicating a non-trivial evolution of the in-plane film structure. Moreover, at 1.5 ML a stronger scattering on the specular rod is observed as for 2.5 ML of coverage. This has to be attributed to a modified film morphology between both layer. We wish to acknowledge the excellent collaboration with our local contact Jakub Drnec as well as the beamline scientist Roberto Felici, which made this experiment such a success.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1</head><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *C.
