<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We studied the switching mechanism of resistive memories comparing NiO/Pt full sheet samples in the pristine state (OFF) and after forming (ON). An innovative forming process allowing the creation of a large amount of conductive paths was implemented. Therefore, meaningful comparative HAXPES analyses could be performed on both ON and OFF states in a non destructive way. Photon energies of 2.1, 6.5 and 9.75 keV were chosen to probe the NiO surface, the NiO bulk and the NiO/Pt interface. Measurements were performed with secondary monochromators for a detailed analysis of chemical states with high energy resolution. After forming (ON state), a shift of same magnitude was observed for core levels (Ni2p3/2 and O1s) and valence band spectra toward higher binding energies (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This was attributed to Fermi level pinning toward the conduction band due to n-type defects such as electrons trapped at oxygen vacancy sites or delocalized over neighboring Ni 2+ ions giving rise to metallic nickel defects. Our results highlight the role played by defects in the switching mechanism. We suggest oxygen vacancies are created in the NiO conductive state as shown by the core level shifts and band gap states. N-type defects such as oxygen vacancies and metallic nickel could be responsible for the low resistive state of NiO after forming. The non-destructive characterization technique HAXPES was proven a powerful tool for characterizing defects that would otherwise be altered or obscured by destructive characterization techniques. Besides, the link between oxygen defects and resistivity change is established here by direct physicochemical characterization, rather than indirect electrical measurements. This is an important step towards understanding and further development of resistive memories <ref type="table">[1</ref>,<ref type="table">2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results obtained for the CMOS devices</head><p>For sub-32 nm nodes, new materials such as high-k dielectrics and metal gates are integrated together with a thin LaO capping layer to obtain band edge CMOS devices (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). The aim of the experiment was to investigate the impact of high temperature anneal (1065°, 10s) on the diffusion phenomena across the stack. Indeed, La is expected to diffuse towards the high-k/SiO 2 interface creating a dipole that modifies the band alignment of the structure. Two LaO thicknesses (0.4 and 1 nm) were deposited to evaluate the impact of the La quantity on the dipole strength. Taking advantage from the high photoelectrons escape depths, analyses were performed without removal of the TiN layer, in order to preserve the thin LaO underlying layer. This is a real advantage compared to laboratory XPS. HAXPES measurements were performed at two photon energies: 3.81 and 7.95 eV. High energy resolution (300 meV) was reached thanks to a beam spectral width optimized with a post monochromator. In these conditions, we were able to perform high-resolution analysis of the in-depth La-related chemical states <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Binding energies are given relative to the Fermi level measured with a clean gold surface. In order to take into account the decay of the beam intensity during acquisition, all spectra were normalized to the secondary electron background at low binding energies, which is assumed to be directly proportional to the photon flux. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows the La 3d 5/2 core-level spectra for the as-deposited and annealed samples with 1 nm of LaO x capping. Upon annealing, a decrease of the La 3d 5/2 intensity is observed, which suggests the diffusion of lanthanum towards the bottom interfaces in the gate stack. In addition, the line shape (known to be extremely sensitive to the La first nearest neighbours) drastically changes: this indicates an evolution of the La-related chemical states upon annealing.</p><p>The Si 1s core level was used to further investigate the interfacial chemistry of the buried interfaces. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> also shows the Si 1s spectra obtained for both as-deposited and annealed samples with 1 nm of LaO x capping layer, respectively. A detailed decomposition of the spectra was made based on the analysis of the reference spectra (samples without LaO x capping layer, not shown), and previous work to identify Si sub-oxides and nitrided states. Four components are identified and characterized by their chemical shift relative to the bulk silicon Si 0 located at 1838.2 eV: i) Si 1+ (1839.1 eV), ii) Si-N (1840.3 eV), iii) Si 3+ in Hf silicate oxinitride (1841.4 eV) and iv) Si 4+ in SiO 2 (at 1842.5 eV). After insertion of La into the gate stacks, an additional component appears at an energy shift of ~ 2.6 eV relative to the bulk Si 0 . This new component is ascribed to La-O-Si bonds and exhibits a clear enhancement after annealing, thus indicating the formation of La silicate as a result of La diffusion inside the high-k and interfacial layers.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Ni2p 3/2 (a), O1s (b) core level and valence band (c) photoelectron spectra obtained by HAXPES at 2.1keV.</figDesc></figure>
