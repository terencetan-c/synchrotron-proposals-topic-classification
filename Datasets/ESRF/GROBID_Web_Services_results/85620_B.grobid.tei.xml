<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Decoupling absorption and decoherence in single-bunch X-ray phase contrast images of laser-shock-induced compression waves </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Tomography Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the tomographic slices obtained at varying static compression pressures. Pore collapse can be clearly observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radiography</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the radiographs obtained at varying sample-to-detector distances and varying pressure. As the foam was compressed, the average transmission through the foam decreased by 16%, which is the same between the contact images (d = 0.05 m) and the phase-contrast images (d = 7.2 m). This indicate that the dark band in dynamic shock experiment [1] is mainly due to changes in transmission due to pore collapse, and the contribution from decoherence effect (if any) is negligible. We need to find news strategies to quantify the pore sizes as they collapse. We note that at d = 7.2 m (the same propagation distance used in the dynamic experiments), the image is dominated by speckles. A shorter propagation distance d=1.2 m is necessary if phase retrieval is desired for future data analysis. We also note that the measured change in transmission in static compression, was 23% is less than the measured in dynamic compression. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>From theoretical considerations, it is expected that the maximum pressure achieved during static compression is well beyond the onset of compaction in dynamic compression. Consequently we have seen that the measured transmission of the XPCI images during static compression is comparable to the values obtained during dynamic compression. We can therefore say that the pore collapse we observed from tomography during static compression can give the real picture of pore collapse in dynamic compression. We can therefore say that the observed dark band attributed to a compaction wave in dynamic compression experiment is indeed related to pore collapse. 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 average transmission pressure (MPa) d=0.05 m d=7.2 m T = -0.17 T = -0.16 Figure 3.
