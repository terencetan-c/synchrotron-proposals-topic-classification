<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this proposal is to investigate local lattice distortions in epitaxial layers of the topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) SnTe, Pb 1-x Sn x Te and Pb 1-x Sn x Se by the measurement and analysis of the temperature dependence of diffracted Bragg peaks in order to assess the impact of structural perturbations on the topological properties of these materials. Recently, the existence of local electric dipoles in SnTe was reported well above the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Similar observations were also reported for PbTe <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, for which an order-disorder transition was proposed to exist at 250K, based on the analysis of pair-distribution functions (PDFs) of polycrystalline PbTe samples and the temperature dependence of the first PDF peak. This was interpreted as evidence for a displacement of the atoms from their lattice positions by ~0.24 Ǻ along the 100 directions. Our calculations based on kinematical diffraction theory show that such small atom displacements affect the structure factor and hence the integrated intensities of the diffractions with large hkl's. In order to detect the mentioned atomic displacements, we have measured x-ray diffraction intensities in reciprocal lattice points hhh starting from h = 2 up to h =14 using a high photon energy. We have investigated four samples with 1 μm thick layers of Pb 1-x Sn x Te with different concentrations x ranging from 0.0 to 0.6, on BaF 2 (111) substrate. The experimental conditions were the following. We have used fixed energy of 69 keV (0.17833 Å) in order to detect as many diffraction spots as possible from the layer and from the substrate. Diffractometer was set-up to allow low and high angles of diffraction from planar samples and azimuthal rotation of the sample. As a detector, we have used FReLoN camera 2k (2048×2048 pixels) with pixel size of 47.5 μm, thus the field of view being slightly less than 10×10 mm. It was mounted on a vertical arm behind the sample which allowed linear scanning of the detector plane from low to high positions (angular motor for two-theta was not available). Different types of scans were performed for substrate and layer diffraction peaks, mainly omega-scans and azimuthal scans. Field of view of the FReLoN camera allowed us to measure symmetric diffractions from 222 to 14 14 14. Additionally to the integrated intensities of diffraction maxima we measured also threedimensional intensity maps of diffuse scattering between the diffraction maxima; these measurements allow us to detect possible correlatios of the occupations of the Pb/Sn lattice places. The tree-dimnesional reciprocal space maps have been measured by performing omega-scans through diffraction maxima and large azimuthal scans over a 120deg range, so that large three-dimensional regions of reciprocal space were scanned. All measurements were carried out at 10 temperatures between 100K and 300K, the samples were cooled by a nitrogen cryostream. During the beamtime we obtained a huge amount of experimental data, the analysis of which is not finished yet. In this report we present the following examples of measured data. In   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig 1 we show the intensity distribution [panel (a)] and the maximum intensities [panel (b)] around the 222 maxima of the Pb 1-x Sn x Te layer (x=0.4, broad maximum) and the BaF 2 substrate (sharp peak). The image in panel (a) was obtained by integration of about 150 detector frames obtained during an eta scan (incidence angle scan) at 100K. The curve in panel (b) was obtained by taking the maximum intensities from individual detector frames at various icidence angles eta. Figure 2 shows the reciprocal-space image and the diffraction curve of the same sample in diffraction 888. From the integrated intensities we determine the magnitudes of the layer structure factors and the mutual displacements of the Pb/Sn and Te sublattices as a function of temperature. [1] K. R.
