<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Boosting the ethanol synthesis from CO 2 hydrogenation over Rh-based catalyst generated via SOMC Overview Gallium (Ga) has emerged as a promising promoter in several systems (M/support), from the classical Cu-based catalysts to Ni-based and Pd-based systems. Thanks to tailored made materials prepared using Surface Organometallic Chemistry, that enable to better control composition and interfaces, this change of reactivity has been ascribed to the (reversible) formation of MGa alloy and M/GaOx or MGa/GaOx interfaces. Such promotional effect is particularly noteworthy for Ni-and Pd-since both of these metals are not known to promote CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, but rather methanation (Ni) or be prone to poisoning by CO (Pd). We thus further explore a series of Ga-promoted bimetallic catalysts (MGa@SiO2, M = Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir) prepared via an SOMC approach and show that in all cases the presence of Ga promote the selective hydrogenation of CO2 hydrogenation towards methanol/DME with selectivity &gt; 50%, in contrast to the mono-metallic cases (M@SiO2 catalysts) that always favor methanation reaction (CH4 &gt; 97%). By conducting ex situ as well as in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments to identify the speciation of these monometallic and bimetallic catalysts especially under working state, we hope to elucidate the interplay between structure and catalytic performance for Ga-promoted catalysts. In combination with other spectroscopic (IR, XPS), microscopic (TEM, STEM-HAADF, EDX) techniques and computational approaches (AIMD or static DFT) on these catalysts, we hope to clarify the universally promotional effect of Ga and the associated reaction mechanism. The outcomes of this proposal will enable to rationally design the next generation of catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, which would have an important impact on decarbonizing our economy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data obtained and experimental parameters</head><p>In situ X-ray adsorption spetrac data were collected on powered sample of monometallic M@SiO2 and Gapromoted bimetallic MGa@SiO2 catalysts (M = Ru, Rh and Ir) packed into the quartz capillaries (1.5 mm with 0.02 mm wall thichness). Data were collected at beam energies range from 22-23.1 keV for the Ru K, from 23.21-24.21 keV for the Rh K, from 11.12-12.22 keV for the Ir L3 and 10.27-11.37 keV for Ga K. Flow rates (Ar, H2, CO2) were controlled using mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and pressure was set at 20 bar using a back pressure regulator (Bronkhorst, EL-PRESS). The temperature for H2 reduction (400 o C) and CO2 hydeogenation (230 o C) were maintained using a SiC heating element. Outlet gas was detected using a mass spetrometer (MS, Pfeiffer vacuum) mounted after the back-pressure regulator.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Scheme for the temperature profile for a typical experiment.</p><p>In a typical experiment, EXAFS spetra were first collected after the sample was mounted and exposed to air. Subsequently, H2 pretreatment was carried out under 10 mL/min of H2 for 1 h at 400 o C (300 o C h -1 ramp), while continously collecting XANES spectra. After the pretreatment and cool down room temperature, EXAFS spetra were collected for the reduced sample. Then, heating to reaction temperature (230 o C) under 10 mL of H2/Ar mixture (300 o C h -1 ramp), followed pressurizing to 20 bar and keeping 20 min. Subsequently, switching to CO2/H2/Ar mixture for CO2 hydrogenation 2 h,then, the XANES spetra were collected druing the CO2 hydrogenation. After CO2 hydrogenation, the gas was switched to Ar and the temperature was cooled to room teperature for the post-CO2-hydrogenation EXAFS spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work and anticipated output</head><p>The XAS data has currently been processed. The XAS data has already shown insights into the evolution of catalyst structure in the duration of H2 pretreatment and CO2 hydrogenation, such as the MGa (M = Ru, Rh, Ir) alloying detected after H2 reduction and CO2 hydrogeantion. The in situ DRIFTS will be further carried out to monitor the differences in the intermediates over the monometallic catalysts Ga-promoted catalysts bimetallic catalysts. Two manuscripts for the universal role of Ga on the transition metal for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol are expected once the complementary characterizations are at hand. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>van Beek, Dr. Dragos Stoian Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Wei Zhou*, Colin Hansen*, Xiaoyu Zhou*, Christian Ehinger* Laboratorium für Anorganische Chemie, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland Report:</figDesc></figure>
