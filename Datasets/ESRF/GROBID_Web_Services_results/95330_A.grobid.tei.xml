<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Variable Induced Defects in Hybrid Perovskites MAPbI3 exists in three temperature dependent morphologies (shown below) and certain research has shown that the cubic phase is the most efficient structure for photovoltaic devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Despite its promising photovolatic capabilities in research, these solar cells have not yet made it to the commerical market -largely due to its instability when in contact with moisture or at elevated temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. One such suggestion for improving stability is suppressing or shifting the transitions of MAPbI3 or even stabilising the high temperature cubic phase at room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We have been developing a number of post-synthetic annealing treatments that have shown to alter structure of MAPbI3 at room temperature.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in France during the beamtime schedule, users were unable to be present for this experiment and so measurments were carried out by the local contact Dr Charlie McMonagle, with contact occuring remotely between himself and the us as the users. During this time we were able to study several of these the samples of MAPbI3 that we had previously treated post-synthetically, where the annealing time had been varied. Each of these samples were packed into capillaries and measured from 100 K -400 K with a wavelength of 0.64114 Å. This temperature range allowed us to observe all three phase transitions that occur in MAPbI3 so we could study any differences between pristine MAPbI3 that is reported in literature.</p><p>Initial measurements were taken at 300 K, Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> highlights a section of the pattern for each sample where there is noticable suppression of the 211 reflection with increasing treatment time. The suppression of this reflection is synonymous with the increasing presence of a cubic phase within the samples. This hypothesis is further supported by the peak shape evolution that is seen is Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> where as treatment time is increased, a merging of the doublets seen between 11.6° -11.8° and 12.9° -13.2° to a single peak.</p><p>9.0 9.2 9.4 9.6 9.8 10.0 10.2 10.4 10.6 10.8 11.0 11.2 11.4 11.6 11.8 12.0 12.2 12.4 12.6 12.8 13.0 13.2 13.4 Intensity (a.u.) b) Intensity (a.u.) 2q (°) 2h 1h30 1h 0h30 0h15</p><p>a)</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. a) Observed decrease in peak intensity 211 reflection with increasing the annealing time of treatment. b) evolution of peak shape from 'tetragonal' doublet to 'cubic' singlet peak with increasing annealing time of each sample. Patterns were measured at 300 K.</p><p>We also observed a shifting of the tetragonal to cubic transition temperature, which was dependent on how long MAPbI3 had been exposed to the post-synthetic treatment. The contour plot seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates this lowering of the tetragonal to cubic phase transition temperature upon heating from 300 K -400 K, and further lowering of this temperature when cooling down from 400 K which suggests there is a hysteric effect of these transitions in the treated samples. Another possible reason for this supposed lowering of the phase transition temperature is that the sample may have been a slightly different temperature than the cryostat reported value. We use Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> to show the estimated temperature at which these transitions occur for each sample, however the difference in temperature between each measurement is 4 K and so further work would need to be done to gain more precise data the transition temperature for each sample. Further support for this shifting of the transition temperature is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, where sequential refinements of the data for each sample were performed based on the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3. From this the lattice parameters were extracted and the ratio between the c and a lattice parameters have been plotted as a function of temperature. Doing this enables us to see more clearly the temperature at which the material transitions from a tetragonal to cubic structure. a) b) c) d) e)</p><p>Despite clear shifting in the high temperature phase transition, we are unable to see any observable temperature shift for the lower transition between the tetragonal to orthohombic phases. Each sample went through the transition to the orthorhombic phase at 160 K, which is the temperature that has previously been reported for pristine MAPbI3. This leads us to believe that this post synthetic treatment does not have an effect on the structure of MAPbI3 at lower temperatures.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Jessica Dawber Professor Mark Green University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, CT2 7NH, UK Report: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have attracted attention in the development of efficient photovoltaic devices due to their low cost synthesis and power conversion effieiences that are competitive to silicon.
