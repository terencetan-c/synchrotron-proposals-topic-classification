<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Ice exhibits a stunning number of phases (at least 13 crystalline phases have been identified so far), which is of fundamental interest to condensed matter physics. The high-pressure polymorphism of ice is also relevant to applied sciences such as geophysics and planetary physics. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> An earlier XRS study on low-temperature ice phases <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> demonstrated that the near-edge spectra show marked differences between the different ice phases (especially in the pre-edge region), and linked these to changes in proton ordering and the Madelung potential. Low statistics, however, prevented a systematic comparison with electronic structure calculations. Given that the structure of the hydrogen bond network in liquid water is still not completely characterized [3], ice phases provide very interesting model systems. Difficulties in modeling the pre-edge signal in liquid water and its implications of a substantial hydrogen-bonding asymmetry in the liquid phase has lead to an ongoing debate. Providing new experimental information on structurally known H 2 O systems will be highly relevant to this issue, and also in the modeling of other hydrogen bonded liquids.</p><p>X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) allows the measurement of low-energy x-ray absorption edges (535 eV for the O K-edge) using high-energy x-rays (∼10 keV at ID16). This lifts the constraints of soft x-ray measurements and allows access to difficult sample environments such as high pressure cells. We applied an earlier developed setup for measuring high-resolution XRS spectra using a panoramic diamond anvil cell with a beryllium gasket (HE-2740) to three previously unmeasured ice phases: VI (tetragonal, ρ = 1.37 g/cm 3 ), VII (cubic, ρ = 1.60 g/cm 3 ) and VIII (the proton-ordered form of ice VII). The cell was loaded with ultrapure water and a small ruby chip for pressure calibration using the pressure dependence of the ruby fluorescence line. The diamond culet size was 1 mm, the gasket diameter 5 mm, and the sample size under pressure ∼300 µm. XRS spectra were recorded at 1.7 GPa and room temperature (RT) (ice VI), 2.2 GPa and RT (ice VII), and 2.2 GPa and -10 • C (ice VIII). For ice VIII, the cell was cooled with a cryo-cooled flow of dry air. The phases were identified with in situ x-ray diffraction using a Mar CCD area detector.</p><p>The incoming radiation was monochromatized with a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator followed by a Si(440) channelcut. The beam was focused into a 130(H)×50(V) µm 2 spot by a Rh-coated toroidal mirror. The measurements were performed utilizing a multianalyzer spectrometer, in which the scattered radiation is focused on the 2D photon-counting Maxipix2 detector by 9 spherically bent Si(110) crystal analyzers. Spectra were gathered scanning the incident energy while analyzing the scattered radiation using the Si(660) reflection near backscattering, giving an elastic energy E 0 = 9.68 keV and energy resolution of ∆E = 0.5 eV (FWHM). Spectra were measured at two spectrometer positions, 2θ = {46 • , 134 • }, corresponding to momentum transfers q = {2.1, 5.0} a.u.</p><p>Preliminary results for ice VI are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. The quality of the background-removed spectra are substantially improved compared to the previous highpressure ice XRS measurement <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. We will analyze the results with the help of density-functional theory based spectral calculations [4] using model clusters, taking into account the effect of momentum transfer; an example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
