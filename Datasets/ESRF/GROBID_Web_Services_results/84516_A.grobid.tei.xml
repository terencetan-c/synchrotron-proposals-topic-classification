García-López (Universita degli Studi di Palermo, Dipartimento di Energia, Palermo, Italy) Giuseppe Marcì (Universita degli Studi di Palermo, Dipartimento di Energia, Palermo, Italy)Report:The present research aimed to shed a light on the structural deformations of HPA structure, while it is supported on the oxide surface, which determine the material's catalytic and photocatalytic activity by modifying the composite's acidity. It was supposed that the establishing of such HPA rearrangements would help to elaborate and improve the existing preparation procedures of this important catalyst. The proposed XAS investigations in-situ under catalytic and photocatalytic conditions gave invaluable information about the contribution of oxidation state and structural changes under light irradiation or thermal treatment to the activity of the material, thus providing a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the HPA catalytic performance.XAS study of pristineKeggin and HPA supported on various metal oxides, earlier tested in catalytic propene hydration (E.I.
