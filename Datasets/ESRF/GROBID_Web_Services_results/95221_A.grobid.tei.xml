<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Based on these previous works, in beamtime 25-02-981 we have carried out an X-ray spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction investigation of the magnetite/hematite bilayer, which is an ideal system to study magnetic exchange effects at the interface. The beamtime has focused on the chemical state and structure of the system, using Surface X-ray Diffraction (SXRD), X-ray Reflectometry (XRR), X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) and Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES). The aim of this work has been also to obtain microscopic information on the as-grown system and on the evolution of the system during a high temperature annealing of the bilayers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details and Results:</head><p>Due to COVID-19, this beamtime was not presential, and we had to adapt to the special circumstances. The initial plan was to take to the beamline a single crystal with a pristine epitaxial hematite thin film grown on it, and to monitor the chemical and structural evolution as it was modified in-situ by an ion beam. This plan required the presence of several external researchers, since the experiment was not stardard (it required the installation and continuous control of an ion gun). Due to its complexity and the lack of external researchers in the beamline (motivated by COVID-19) we decided to send the samples already modified from our laboratory in Madrid.</p><p>All the samples were grown in the PLUO (in-house lab) of beamline BM-25 SpLine by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Under the proper conditions, epitaxial α-Fe2O3(0001)/SrTiO3(111) films were grown, as monitored by RHEED and LEED. The samples were then sent to Madrid for the ion-beam modification, which was done with Ar at 1 keV. Previous to the ion-bombardment, the samples were annealed in oxygen to clean the surface and see the LEED pattern before and after the ion bomardment. Two samples showed, after low and medium ion doses, the diffuse LEED pattern of hematite. 2 samples showed, after high and very high ion doses, the diffuse LEED pattern of magnetite. Al the samples were then sent back to SpLine for further anaysis during the beamtime. So, there have been 4 samples under study: #1 α-Fe2O3(0001)/SrTiO3(111), ion bombarded (low dose) (hematite in the surface, according to LEED) #2 α-Fe2O3(0001)/SrTiO3(111), ion bombarded (medium dose) (hematite in the surface, according to LEED) #3 α-Fe2O3(0001)/SrTiO3(111), ion bombarded (high dose) (magnetite in the surface, according to LEED) #4 α-Fe2O3(0001)/SrTiO3(111), ion bombarded (very high dose) (magnetite in the surface, according to LEED)</p><p>The X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) curves show the typical oscillations of a thin film with well defined interfaces and with a thickness around 25 nm.</p><p>The scans in reciprocal space shows the multiple reflections of the different parts of the system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>1.75 1.8 1.85 1.9 1.95 2 2.05 0.5 1 1.5 2 L_STO H_STO 1.000 1.259 1.585 1.995 2.512 3.162 3.981 5.012 6.310 7.943 10.00 12.59 15.85 19.95 25.12 31.62 39.81 50.12 63.10 79.43 100.0 125.9 158.5 199.5 251.2 316.2 398.1 501.2 631.0 794.3 1000 1259 1585 1995 2512 3162 3981 5012 6310 7943 1.000E+4 1.259E+4 1.585E+4 1.995E+4 2.512E+4 3.162E+4 3.981E+4 5.012E+4 6.310E+4 7.943E+4 1.000E+5 intensity STO a-Fe2O3 k=0 1.75 1.8 1.85 1.9 1.95 2 2.05 0.5 1 1.5 2 L_STO H_STO 1.000 1.259 1.585 1.995 2.512 3.162 3.981 5.012 6.310 7.943 10.00 12.59 15.85 19.95 25.12 31.62 39.81 50.12 63.10 79.43 100.0 125.9 158.5 199.5 251.2 316.2 398.1 501.2 631.0 794.3 1000 1259 1585 1995 2512 3162 3981 5012 6310 7943 1.000E+4 1.259E+4 1.585E+4 1.995E+4 2.512E+4 3.162E+4 3.981E+4 5.012E+4 6.310E+4 7.943E+4 1.000E+5 intensity STO a-Fe2O3 k=0 Fe3O4  <ref type="formula">111</ref>)), a rather elongated and diffuse spot of magnetite (just below the "Fe3O4" mark) and a less elongated reflection of hematite (just above the "Fe2O3" mark). On the contrary, sample #2 (left) has received a medium ion dose which has not been enough to clearly form magnetite. Just a tiny reflection is barely visible above the intense hematite reflection (around L=1.8). The annealings of the bilayers, both in UHV (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) and in a background oxygen pressure of 5x10 -6 mbar, showed the irreversible reduction of the hematite into magnetite, yielding a single magnetite thin film. This result is rather interesnting, and somehow, unexpected.</p><p>Also, XPS and HAXPES photoemission spectra of the different samples show the different components of the iron oxides (Fe 3+ , Fe 2+ , magnetite and/or hematite) depending on the specific sample, excitation energy (depth sensitivity) or annealing procedures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and future work:</head><p>Despite the special circumstances, the results of this beamtime have been very positive. We have identified reflections, degree of epitaxial order, crystalline order, domain size, thicknesses... of the different samples. Furthermore, we have identified that a high temperature annealing, in UHV or HV with a slight presence of oxygen gas, does not avoid the chemical reduction of the hematite and its transformation into magnetite. We have now more control on the system, which will allow us to further continue its investigation (mainly related to its magnetic properties).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Física de Materiales, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, SPAIN) Low energy ion bombardment (LEIB) can be used on single-crystalline oxide thin films to produce epitaxial layers of the corresponding suboxide. There have been successful examples using LEIB to obtain titanium oxide (TiO(001)/TiO2(110)) and iron oxide (Fe3O4(111)/α-Fe2O3(0001)/Au(111)) epitaxial heterostructures.</figDesc></figure>

The temperatures, from left to right and from top to bottom, are RT, 125 ºC, 225 ºC, 325 ºC, 400 ºC, 430 ºC, 475 ºC and 515 ºC. Around 430 ºC, hematite has dissapeared, driven by its chemical reduction. The continuous loss of oxygen transforms the initial bilayer into a single well-ordered magnetite thin film.</figDesc></figure>
