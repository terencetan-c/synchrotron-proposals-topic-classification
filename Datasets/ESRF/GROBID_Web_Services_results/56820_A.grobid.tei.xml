<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The beamtime allocated to proposal MX 1704 was used to perfrom solution SAXS measurements on the large dimeric glycoprotein Von Willebrand factor (VWF), in order to probe the conformational states under varying pH and salt conditions. VWF plays an important role in thrombosis and hemostasis. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> gives an overview of the tested samples. On each sample we performed concentration series of 0.25 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml and 1mg/ml. We performed 10 runs in 'flow' mode using the automated sample roboter installed at BM29.</p><p>Sample profiles were analyzed for radiation damage and matching profiles were averaged. Appropriate buffer profiles were averaged and subtracted from the sample profiles. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an example of SAXS data of VWF dimers at a pH of 6.2 for the three different concentrations scaled to each concentration. At low qvalues the profiles exhibit deviations and possible aggregation effects. This behaviour could be seen for all pH conditions. Thus, an adequate Guinier analysis could not be performed. However, when performing dynamic light (DLS) measurements, aggregation could not be observed. When comparing scattering profiles of dimeric VWFs at different pH and salt conditions deviations in the scattering profiles can be detected, indicating a pH and divalent ion dependent conformational change of the dimers. At a pH of 6.2 the SAXS profile in Kratky representation assumes a rather plateau-like shape implying an ensemble of mostly folded (closed) dimer conformations (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). A closed conformation of the dimer was also observed by AFM imaging measurements that we performed in parallel. The conformation of the dimers changes when changing the pH to 7.4. At this pH and in the absence of divalent ions the Kratky plot exhibits a nonparabolic diverging shape for higher q-values, indicating that the dimers adopt a more flexible ensemble (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We succeeded in getting highly purified samples of VWF dimers, which we measured under the same solution conditions at the P12 BioSAXS beamline in Hamburg. The obtained SAXS data confirmed the results from BM12 and a Guinier analysis was possible. A paper including the data is now under review at PNAS.</p><p>Table I pH and salt conditions for SAXS measurements on VWF dimers. pH Divalent ion concentration 6.2 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 7.4 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 7.4 20 mM EDTA 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 VWF pH = 7.4 20mM EDTA VWF pH = 7.4 1mM CaCl 2 VWF pH = 6.2 1mM CaCl 2 q (nm -1 ) I(q) • q 2 (arb. units) Fig. 2 Kratky representation of VWF dimers at a pH of 6.2 and a pH of 7.4 in the presence and absence of divalent ions.
