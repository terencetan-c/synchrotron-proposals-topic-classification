<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This was a highly successful session. Scanning XRD was performed on two self-healing polymer systems. Representative data from one of these materials is presented below. Scheme 1 shows the two polymeric components which form a supramolecular non-covalently linked complex due to hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking interactions of polydiimide 1 and polyamide 2. Details of synthesis and characterization were published previously. 1 Scheme 1. The two components of the supramolecular healing polymeric system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The size of the microfocus beam was 350 × 400 nm and the sample was scanned through the beam with two configurations: (a) low magnification -horizontal step size of 53 μm, vertical step size of 20 μm; (b) high magnification -horizontal step size of 4 μm, vertical step size of 16 μm . Arrays of microfocus XRD patterns are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for a specimen in which damage was induced by cutting the edge of a film, perpendicular to the edge as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (right-hand side). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows a scanned array of XRD patterns obtained with the larger step size (scale shown), the cut can clearly be seen top centre because the XRD patterns are shaded darker, corresponding to reduced transmission, thus mapping the damaged regions. Further detailed analysis of integrated 1D intensity profiles will be discussed shortly. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows a zoom-in (smaller scan step size). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows profiles obtained for the sample before annealing. In agreement with our previous report, 1 the primary peaks in this pattern correspond to spacings of 3.4 Å and 5.1 Å. The former spacing has been assigned to a π-π stacking distance of the pyrenemethylurea units, and the latter has been ascribed to the distance between hydrogen bonded urea/urethane units within the polymer. An additional broad peak is observed at 2.1 Å (outside the q range previously investigated). At low q, two sharper peaks are observed with spacings of 13.2 Å and 15.9 Å. The three profiles in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> show that the XRD patterns in the undamaged regions are the same (similar profiles were obtained from patterns elsewhere outside the damaged area), however the profile in the damaged region is different. The main difference is the reduced intensity (due to a reduction of the amount of sample in the beam). However, there is an additional change in the shape of the background. Detailed analysis (vide infra) of the region comprising the 3.4 Å and 5.1 Å peaks shows in fact no qualitative difference in these peaks in the damaged area. During annealing, differences in XRD profiles between previously damaged and surrounding areas disappear as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. This in fact is a central finding of this work. The fact that the microfocus XRD patterns in the previously damaged regions recover, and that the 3.4Å and 5.1 Å reflections are retained shows that self-healing occurs within the damaged region. In other words, the supramolecular structure with π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions is involved in the self-healing in the damaged region. Alternative possibilities such as fractionation on heating, or the involvement of non-supramolecular interactions in the healing process, can be excluded. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> also contains profiles obtained on cooling back to 30 o C, following annealing. The three profiles plotted (two in undamaged regions, one in the previously damaged location) all superpose. The profiles have a different background to those measured during annealing, but contain the same diffraction features confirming that the healed structure is retained. In summary, these data indicate that self-healing occurs via re-establishment of hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions in the damaged region. This work is presently being prepared for publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
