<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Analysing the data we received during out stay in the ESRF we found that biomolecules in ZnO, indeed, have a strong effect on lattice parameters caused by intra-crystalline strain. This result can be seen from figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, presenting the most intense peak ( 11.05 θ = °) of four ZnO samples (pure ZnO, ZnO with 3mg/ml glutamic acid, 3mg/ml lysine and 3mg/ml serine added to solution during the crystallization process). A clear shift of the peak center position can be noticed. A low intensity of serine peak (pink colour) was caused by the existence of an addition phase of Zn(OH) 2 . This phase formed due to inhibition of ZnO growth induced by the presence of serine in the solution during the crystallization process. The coexistence of both phases influenced peak intensity but had no effect on peak position. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, presents the same XRD peak after heating the samples to 0 300 Cfor 90 min. It can be seen from the figure that all the peaks returned to the original position (indicated by the pure ZnO sample) due to strain release caused by amino acid destruction. The Zn(OH) 2 phase of serine disappeared due to water evaporation. Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> shows that there is a strong correlation between amino acid concentration and the resulting peak shift for glutamic acid in different concentrations in solution (0.5mg/ml, 1mg/ml, 3mg/ml, 6mg/ml). The same correlation was noticed for many others samples. We can conclude that increasing amino acid concentration in the solution leads to stronger XRD peak shift and therefore an increase in lattice parameters.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> presents the same XRD peak for two glutamic acid concentrations (3mg/ml, 6mg/ml) after heating the samples to 0 300 Cfor 90 min. The figure shows that both peaks returned to the original position and overlap with the pure ZnO sample. In addition, it can be seen from figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> that the peak for ZnO grown with 6mg/ml glutamic acid is split up. The reason for this is anisotropic interaction between the amino acid and the bulk material. The incorporation of the amino acid crystal took place in some of the crystals whereas some of them remained pure. After the thermal heating, the peak returned to its original position and form (fig2b).</p><p>In order to prove that the peak position shifts is caused by the presence of intra-crystalline amino acids, we performed EDS analysis for a ZnO sample grown in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml in the crystallization solution. This sample showed a strong shift in peak position. We chose cysteine due to the presence of Sulphur atoms in the molecule structure, which can be easily noticed by EDS. The analysis showed that there is at least 1atomic% of cysteine inside the crystal (fig 3). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: a) Main XRD peak position of pure ZnO (blue) and ZnO crystallized in the presence of 0.5mg/ml of glutamic acid (red), 1mg/ml of glutamic acid (green), 3mg/ml of glutamic acid (pink) and 6mg/ml of glutamic acid (maroon). b) The same peak for 3mg/ml of glutamic acid (pink) and 6mg/ml of glutamic acid (maroon) after thermal treatment at 300°C for 90 min.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: EDS results for ZnO crystal grown in the presence of 0.5mg/ml amino acids.</p><p>ZnO pure ZnO with 3mg/ml Glu.

Lattice parameters were received and the strain calculated as the change in lattice parameter for each direction of the Wurtzite structure (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The quality of the estimation is presented by chi^2 parameter. From table 1, it can be noticed that a significant strain value (more than 0. 1%) was received for ZnO crystals incorporated with Glutamic acid 3 and 6 mg/ml, Histidine 3mg/ml, Lysine 4mg/ml, Serine 6 and 3 mg/ml, Cysteine 0.5 and 0.3 mg/ml and Seleno-cysteine 0.5mg/ml. For all samples, except cysteine and seleno-cysteine, the strain released after thermal treatment of 300°C for 90 min. For cysteine and seleno-cysteine, the presence of sulphur and selenium atoms in the molecule caused a strong chemical interaction, which could not be released by a simple low temperature thermal treatment.</p><p>Band gap energy was measured using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer with the addition of an integrated spear. The band gap energy was estimated from reflectance spectra in diffusion mode. A clear shift of band gap energy is noticed in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, for the ZnO sample crystallized with 3mg/ml of serine in solution (red). Moreover, the band gap moved toward the pure ZnO value (3.3eV) after heating to 300°C for 90 min and coincides with pure ZnO band gap after additional heating to 500°C for 90 min. Inset in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> is a zoom-in on the band gap area.</p><p>For a better understanding of the incorporation of amino acids within the crystal structure, an accurate concentration measurement of intra-crystalline amino acids is required. To achieve this the samples have been sent to Aminolab laboratory Rehovot, Israel, for chemical analysis, but the results have not yet been received.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: Cary 5000 spectroscope reflectance (using integrated spear) for pure ZnO (blue) and ZnO crystallized in the presence of 3mg/ml of serine at different temperatures.
