<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The valence state of uranium has been confirmed for the three sodium uranates NaU V O 3 /[Rn](5f 1 ), Na 4 U VI O 5 / [Rn](5f 0 ), and Na 2 U VI 2 O 7 /[Rn](5f 0 ), using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Solid-state 23 Na magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) measurements have been performed for the first time, yielding chemical shifts at -29.1 (NaUO 3 ), 15.1 (Na 4 UO 5 ), and -14.1 and -19 ppm (Na1 8-fold coordinated and Na2 7-fold coordinated in Na 2 U 2 O 7 ), respectively. The [Rn]5f 1 electronic structure of uranium in NaUO 3 causes a paramagnetic shift in comparison to Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 , where the electronic structure is [Rn]5f 0 . A 23 Na multi quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) study on Na 2 U 2 O 7 has confirmed a monoclinic rather than rhombohedral structure with evidence for two distinct Na sites. DFT calculations of the NMR parameters on the nonmagnetic compounds Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 have permitted the differentiation between the two Na sites of the Na 2 U 2 O 7 structure. The linear thermal expansion coefficients of all three compounds have been determined using high-temperature X-ray diffraction: α a = 22.7 × 10 -6 K -1 , α b = 12.9</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) have been selected as a promising concept for the next generation of nuclear reactors by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> From safety perspectives it is essential to gain a thorough knowledge of the potential products of reaction between the (U,Pu)O 2 mixed oxide fuel and the sodium coolant, as the two might come into contact in the event of a breach of the stainless steel cladding, even though such events are extremely rare under normal operating conditions. Numerous studies have been carried out in the past to assess the direct consequences, including further cladding failure, restriction of the flow of coolant within a subassembly of fuel pins, or contamination of the primary coolant with plutonium, minor actinides, or highly radioactive fission products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> As part of our program of research at the Joint Research Centre-Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU, Karlsruhe, Germany), we are currently investigating the structural, thermomechanical and thermodynamic properties of the numerous compounds forming in the Na-U-O, Na-Np-O, and Na-Pu-O phase diagrams. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> We report herein a X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), and high-temperature X-ray diffraction study of NaUO 3 , Na 4 UO 5 , and Na 2 U 2 O 7 . XANES is a powerful technique to determine the valence state and coordination environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR offers deep insight into the structure of the material, giving information on the number of Na sites, the structural order/disorder, the local Na coordination environment in terms of Na-O distances, and the degree of asymmetry of the coordination sphere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Uranium has a [Rn](5f 1 ) electronic configuration in NaUO 3 and a [Rn](5f 0 ) electronic configuration in Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 . The effect of unpaired f electrons on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR spectrum is particulary interesting and has been investigated here. We have also carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations of NMR parameters using the DFT-GIPAW <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> (gauge including projector augmented wave) code, specifically devised to treat periodic solids: i.e., not limited to the cluster approach as recently described for UO 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2+</head><p>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> It is shown that for the diamagnetic phases Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 good agreement with the experimental data is obtained, offering interesting perspectives for future investigation of similar materials (though this approach is not yet applicable to paramagnetic phases). To the authors' knowledge, reports of the high-temperature behavior of these compounds are limited, if not nonexistent. The study of the materials' thermal expansion properties appears, however, to be a critical issue for the real-time modeling of the evolution of a pin failure in case of an accident.</p><p>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) Studies. All the details of the X-ray diffraction studies performed on the NaUO 3 , Na 4 UO 5 , and Na 2 U 2 O 7 compounds are given in the Supporting Information. We have confirmed the known structures of NaUO 3 12 and Na 4 UO 5 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> NaUO 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Pbnm, with lattice parameters a = 5.778(3) Å, b = 5.909(3) Å, and c = 8.284(3) Å, while Na 4 UO 5 has a tetragonal structure, space group I4/m, with lattice parameters a = 7.548(3) Å and c = 4.637(3) Å. We have also found clear evidence that Na 2 U 2 O 7 is isotructural with Na 2 Np 2 O 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> and K 2 U 2 O 7 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> i.e. monoclinic, in the space group P2 1 (with two Na sites which are 7-and 8-fold coordinated), and not rhombohedral R3̅ m (with a 6-fold Na site) as reported in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> The corresponding cell parameters were determined at a = 6.887(3) Å, b = 7.844(3) Å, c = 6.380(3) Å, and β = 111.29(5)°. The unit cell volume is slightly greater for the uranium (321.2 Å 3 ) than for the neptunium compound (313.9 Å 3 ), which is consistent with the ionic radii of U 6+ and Np 6+ . <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> XANES spectra of the three phases were collected at the U-L III edge together with U IV O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and U VI O 3 reference compounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The energy positions of the inflection points and of the white lines are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Soldatov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> already measured NaU V O 3 , and our results are in very good agreement with their work. The low-energy shoulder is an intrinsic feature of the uranium unoccupied (6d) electronic states of the U V within the NaUO 3 phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> The inflection points and white lines of Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 are perfectly aligned with those of U VI O 3 . A shoulder is also observed for these two compounds about 15 eV after the white line, a feature specific to U VI , <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and no shoulder is found below it, as is the case for U V . <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Those results are consistent with uranium being exclusively in the oxidation state VI in Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 and therefore having a [Rn]5f 0 electronic shell. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Magic Angle Spinning (NMR-MAS) Measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR has proven to be an efficient tool to probe the local structure in a wide range of materials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> complementary to X-ray diffraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> for crystal structure investigation. The compounds NaUO 3 and Na 4 UO 5 possess a single crystallographic site for Na. Their <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR spectra and fits are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The line shapes are typical of a powder second-order quadrupolar broadening, and the well-defined (i.e., sharp) singularities are indicative of well-ordered phases. For each compound, a single resonance is observed, in agreement with the X-ray diffraction data. 12, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The 23 Na signal of the 8-fold coordinated sodium in NaUO 3 was identified at -29.1 ppm, with a quadrupolar coupling constant C Q and an asymmetry parameter η Q equal to 1.7 MHz and 0.5, respectively (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). This asymmetry parameter η Q is consistent with the distorted NaO 8 octahedra. The isotropic chemical shift δ CS of NaUO 3 was compared with those previously reported for other crystals (reference data of Mackenzie <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> and Ashbrook <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> ) and is slightly outside the range expected for 8-fold coordination (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> in the Supporting Information). As the NaUO 3 compound is paramagnetic at room temperature (χ = 395 × 10 -6 emu mol -1 ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> the variation of δ CS at higher fields can be explained by a paramagnetic shift due to the pentavalent uranium ion (5f 1 ): i.e., following an interaction between sodium nuclei and unpaired electrons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref>   The <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR spectrum of the 6-fold coordinated sodium site in Na 4 UO 5 was identified at 15.1 ppm and is in agreement with the fact that sodium atoms are surrounded by uranium(VI), where no paramagnetic shift contribution is expected (-20 ≤ δ CS (Na(VI)) ≤ +20). A quadrupolar constant of 3.2 MHz and an asymmetry parameter of 0.2 were determined by fitting of the line shape. Such a low η Q value is consistent with the symmetry of NaO 6 , which is close to a regular octahedron (i.e., η Q = 0 for cylindrical symmetry).</p><p>In contrast to the spectra of NaUO 3 and Na 4 UO 5 , the MAS NMR spectrum of Na 2 U 2 O 7 is featureless with a line shape (asymmetrical tail) suggesting structural disorder (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The synthesized compound was obtained with a rather poor crystallinity, as explained in the Supporting Information. Imperfect stoichiometry as a source of disorder was ruled out by the XANES results, which indicated pure U(VI) valence. A possible explanation could lie in the grain size of the synthesized product.</p><p>At first glance, the MAS NMR spectrum can be interpreted as a single site with local disorder. However, to gain more insight, a <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na multi quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) NMR study was performed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). MQMAS yields a twodimensional spectrum in which the second-order quadrupolar anisotropic broadening is suppressed in the indirect dimension (isotropic dimension F 1 ), as is well illustrated by NaUO 3 (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> in the Supporting Information). The sheared 3QMAS spectrum of Na 2 U 2 O 7 is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The lower crystallinity of this compound is confirmed in the 2D spectrum by a distribution of chemical shift anisotropies. This spectrum can be compared with that of NaUO 3 , which presents a well-defined quadrupolar line shape (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> in the Supporting Information). The direct differentiation between the two sodium sites of the monoclinic structural model is therefore not obvious at first sight. Nevertheless, the isotropic spectrum (free of anisotropic second-order quadrupolar broadening, as provided by a projection of the 2D MQMAS on the isotropic dimension) can be fitted using Gaussian line shapes identified at δ ISO (corresponding to the isotropic shift in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na Chemical Shifts (δ CS ), Quadrupolar Coupling Constants (C Q ), Asymmetry Parameters (η Q ), and the Quadrupolar Products (P Q ) of the Three Sodium Uranates Inorganic Chemistry Article The occupancy of each site is found at 64% for Na a and 36% for Na b . This deviation from 1:1 can be explained by the nonquantitativity of the MQMAS experiment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> Using slices extracted at these values of δ ISO , the values of the total isotropic shift (i.e., the center of gravity) of the central transition (δ MAS ) can be determined for each site, yielding -23.5 (Na a ) and -23.4 ppm (Na b ), respectively. Given its complex shape, a precise fitting of the MQMAS spectrum is difficult and was not attempted. Nevertheless, the shift δ ISO and δ MAS can be used to obtain δ iso and P Q (the quadrupolar product) without fitting the MQMAS spectrum. For a spin 3 / 2 , one can obtain the two values using the equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">compd δ CS (ppm) C Q (MHz) η Q P Q (MHz)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">δ δ ν ν = -( 10 )/(10 ) Q MAS iso 2 6 0 2</formula><p>(1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">δ δ = + v v 17 /8 ( 10 )/(8 ) Q ISO iso 2 6 0 2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">I = 3 / 2 . ν Q is the quadrupolar frequency (ν Q = 3C Q (1 + 2η/3) 1/2 /2I(2I -1))</formula><p>, and ν 0 is the Larmor frequency. Applying eq 1, δ iso was found to be equal to -19 (Na a ) and -14.1 ppm (Na b ), and P Q to be equal to 1.4 (Na a ) and 2.0 MHz (Na b ), respectively. The order of magnitude of P Q values is consistent with that found for NaUO 3 and Na 4 UO 5 (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</p><p>As the compounds Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 have no unpaired electrons (5f 0 shell, U VI ), they offer the opportunity to assess DFT calculations of NMR parameters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> As shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, a good correlation is obtained by plotting the experimental isotropic chemical shift against the theoretical isotropic chemical shielding (σ iso ), with a slope of 0.91. This shows that such calculations can predict well the observed difference in δ iso . Linear regression analysis provides the reference isotropic chemical shielding (σ ref ) (the intercept value) yielding σ ref = 519 ppm. On this basis, one can now attribute the two sodium sites in Na 2 U 2 O 7 , where Na a corresponds to Na2 (NaO 7 7-fold coordinated) and Na b to Na1 (NaO 8 8-fold coordinated), using the same notation as for Na 2 Np 2 O 7 in the work of Smith et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> in the Supporting Information). Hereafter, the two sodium sites in given the known high sensitivity of NMR to slight structural variations, this discrepancy can be ascribed to the structural models used in our calculation that would need further refinement, especially to account for the disorder as revealed by the MQMAS spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>A linear decrease of δ iso with increasing site size was observed in several sodium compounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> Similarly, the isotropic chemical shift is plotted against the mean Na-O bond distance (denoted ⟨Na-O⟩) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>. A decrease of δ iso with increasing ⟨Na-O⟩ is observed for the four Na sites. Nevertheless, due to its additional paramagnetic shift, the sodium site in NaUO 3 is not aligned with the three other Na sites of the nonmagnetic compounds. Considering only the latter, a regression line of δ iso = -96(⟨Na-O⟩) + 250 (R = 0.999) is obtained. By placing its ⟨Na-O⟩ bond length on this line, one can obtain a rough estimate of the isotropic chemical shift (i.e., isotropic shift free of paramagnetic interaction) of NaUO 3 . A δ iso value of -7 ppm is obtained, suggesting a paramagnetic shift of -22 ppm.</p><p>High-Temperature Behavior. NaUO 3 . To our knowledge, the only high-temperature X-ray diffraction experiment reported in the literature on NaUO 3 is one by Sali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> The aforementioned study goes up to 973 K, while the present study extends the range of temperatures up to 1373 K. Up to 1273 K, no change in crystal structure was observed except for a shift to lower 2θ following the expansion of the unit cell. At 1373 K, NaUO 3 started to decompose into Na 2 U 2 O 7 and UO 2 . A possible reaction of decomposition is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">→ + + 3NaUO (s) Na U O (s) UO (s) Na(g) 3 2 2 7 2</formula><p>(3)  The evolution of the lattice parameters with temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>) was fitted by linear regression. The experiment showed that the cell parameters increased with temperature in all three directions. The corresponding linear thermal expansion coefficients were calculated using eq 4.</p><p>The values obtained were α a = 22.7 × 10 -6 K -1 , α b = 12.9 × 10 -6 K -1 , α c = 16.2 × 10 -6 K -1 , and α vol = 52.8 × 10 -6 K -1 for the temperature range 298-1273 K. Sali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> reported α a = 22.74 × 10 -6 K -1 , α b = 9.34 × 10 -6 K -1 , α c = 15.69 × 10 -6 K -1 , and α vol = 45.71 × 10 -6 K -1 in the temperature range 298-973 K.</p><p>Na 4 UO 5 . There is no report in the literature of hightemperature diffraction experiments carried out on Na 4 UO 5 . No change in crystal structure was observed up to 1073 K. NaUO 3 appeared at 1273 K and was obtained as the major phase upon cooling. We suggest the possible decomposition reaction (5) to explain the occurrence of the latter compound.</p><p>Using eqs 4, the linear thermal expansion coefficients were estimated along the crystallographic axes up to 1073 K (Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> in the Supporting Information): α a = 37.1 × 10 -6 K -1 , α c = 6.2 × 10 -6 K -1 , and α vol = 81.8 × 10 -6 K -1 . The expansion is significant along the a and b directions and limited along the c direction. This evolution can be explained in relation to the particular structure of Na 4 UO 5 . The UO 6 octahedra being oxygen bonded along the c axis, there is limited space for expansion in this direction, in contrast to the a and b directions. The expansion is related to the stretching of the Na-O distances. At 873 K the unit cell parameters obtained were a = 7.703(3) Å and c = 4.654(3) Å. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> gives the atomic positions at 873 K. Between room temperature and 873 K, it is mainly the distance U-O2 that increased, from 1.93(1) to 2.05(1) Å. Na-O2 remained constant at 2.36(1) Å, and Na-O1 increased from 2.38(1) to 2.42(1) Å. As a final point the distance U-O1 exhibited a minor change, from 2.32(1) to 2.33(1) Å due to expansion of the cell parameters. The positions of U and O1 are not refinable.</p><p>Na 2 U 2 O 7 . Cordfunke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> performed thermodynamic measurements on Na 2 U 2 O 7 in 1982, comprising low-temperature (5 to 350 K) heat capacity determinations by adiabatic calorimetry and enthalpy increments in the range 390-926 K by drop calorimetry. The authors reported a slow (α to β) phase transition for the compound above about 600 K. In the present study, the Na 2 U 2 O 7 compound was carefully prepared as described in their publication, in particular with an annealing treatment in oxygen at 500 K, below the α to β phase transition. High-temperature X-ray diffraction measurements were subsequently carried out so as to visualize the transition and determine the coefficients of thermal expansion.</p><p>The X-ray diffraction pattern did not show any significant changes up to 773 K, except for a shift to lower 2θ caused by the thermal expansion of the unit cell. At 873 K, NaUO 3 appeared which formed according to the decomposition reaction (6). At 973 K, Na 2 U 2 O 7 had completely disappeared, and UO 2 was detected at 1073 K following the decomposition of NaUO 3 .</p><p>The materials' coefficients of thermal expansion were estimated up to 573 K, yielding α a = 6.9 × 10 -6 K -1 , α b = 17.3 × 10 -6 K -1 , α c = 29.8 × 10 -6 K -1 , α β = -9.5 × 10 -6 K -1 , and α vol = -217.6 × 10 -6 K -1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> in the Supporting Information).  α α α = ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ a a T b b T c c T 1 1 1 a b c 298 298 298 (4) = + + Na UO (s) NaUO (s) 3Na(g) O (g) 4 5 3 2</p><p>(5) From the present experiment, we could not confirm the existence of an α to β phase transition above about 600 K. The latter transition could not be detected in our DSC experiments either, when the sample was heated to 923 K at various heating rates (5, 7, and 10 K/min). A possible explanation could lie in the very slow kinetics of the transition. In the drop calorimetry experiments performed by Cordfunke et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> the Na 2 U 2 O 7 sample was kept isothermal for several hours in a closed container before being "dropped" at 298 K. In this case, the prolonged heating at constant temperature could allow the formation of the α and β forms of the compound.</p><p>The coefficients of thermal expansion of all three phases are larger than for uranium oxide (α vol = 32.4 × 10 -6 K -1 in the temperature range 298-1600 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> ). This means that local swelling could be a real issue in case of a clad breach and sodium coolant-fuel interaction, potentially inducing further cladding failure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The present work illustrates the powerful combination of MAS NMR and MQMAS in materials chemistry studies, as a complementary tool to X-ray diffraction and as a signature for paramagnetic phases with an unpaired number of 5f electrons.</p><p>The particular [Rn](5f 1 ) electronic structure of uranium in NaUO 3 causes a paramagnetic shift in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR spectrum: the chemical shift was recorded at -29.1 ppm. The quadrupolar coupling constant C Q was 1.7 MHz and the asymmetry parameter 0.5, consistent with the distortion of the NaO 8 octahedron. The coefficients of linear thermal expansion of NaUO 3 were estimated at α a = 22.7 × 10 -6 K -1 , α b = 12.9 × 10 -6 K -1 , α c = 16.2 × 10 -6 K -1 , and α vol = 52.8 × 10 -6 K -1 in the temperature range 298-1273 K.</p><p>XANES studies carried out for the first time on Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 have confirmed the hexavalent state of uranium in those compounds and therefore the [Rn](5f 0 ) electronic configuration. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MAS NMR spectrum of Na 4 UO 5 yielded a chemical shift at 15.1 ppm consistent with the hexavalent uranium. C Q was 3.2 MHz in this case and η Q 0.2, as expected for the regular NaO 6 octahedron. The thermal expansion is high along the a and b directions (α a = 37.1 × 10 -6 K -1 ), and limited along the c direction (α c = 6.2 × 10 -6 K -1 ) as a consequence of the oxygen bonding of the UO 6 octahedra along c and of the (probable) stretching of the Na-O distances.</p><p>The monoclinic structure of Na 2 U 2 O 7 , in space group P2 1 , was supported by our X-ray diffraction studies and a <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na MQMAS experiment, which confirmed the existence of two Na sites with chemical shifts at -14.1 (NaO 8 ) and -19 ppm (NaO 7 ), respectively. The latter chemical shifts are in the expected range for hexavalent uranium. The thermal expansion coefficients of Na 2 U 2 O 7 were found at α a = 6.9 × 10 -6 K -1 , α b = 17.3 × 10 -6 K -1 , α c = 29.8 × 10 -6 K -1 , and α β = -9.5 × 10 -6 K -1 in the temperature range 298-573 K.</p><p>Finally, first-principles calculations were performed on the compounds Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 , which have no unpaired 5f electrons. A rather simple procedure was used to extract the NMR parameters: the resulting parameters have to be considered as mean values of the distributions that characterize each site. Our predictions, which are in good agreement with the experimental results, are very encouraging and clearly validate the use of DFT-NMR calculations for f 0 systems and for future investigations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION</head><p>Raw Materials and Solid-State Synthesis. The NaUO 3 and Na 4 UO 5 compounds were kindly provided by NRG (Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group, Petten, The Netherlands). Na 2 U 2 O 7 was synthesized by a reaction between depleted uranium oxide (UO 2 from JRC-ITU stocks) and sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 99.95%, Sigma) at 1123 K under an oxygen flow in a tubular furnace followed by an annealing treatment at 500 K for 48 h. The starting uranium oxide, being hyperstoichiometric, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> was first reduced to stoichiometry under an Ar/6% H 2 flow at 993 K for 8 h. The X-ray patterns recorded revealed a cubic fluorite structure with the cell parameter 5.468(7) Å, in very good agreement with the value reported in the literature of 5.468(7) Å, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> indicating that the uranium oxide was pure and stoichiometric after thermal treatment.</p><p>Room-Temperature X-ray Diffraction. The crystal structures of the compounds were determined at room temperature by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer mounted in a Bragg-Brentano configuration with a curved Ge monochromator (111) and a ceramic copper tube (40 kV, 40 mA) equipped with a LinxEye position sensitive detector. The data was collected by step scanning in the angle range 10°≤ 2θ ≤ 120°, with an integration time of about 8 h, a count step of 0.02 (2θ), and a dwell of 5 s/step. The sample preparation for XRD analysis consisted of dispersing the powder on the surface of a silicon wafer with 2 or 3 drops of isopropyl alcohol. Structural analysis was performed by the Rietveld method with the Fullprof2k suite. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> High-Temperature X-ray Diffraction. The thermal stabilities of all three compounds were also assessed by high-temperature X-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer mounted with a curved Ge monochromator (111), a copper ceramic X-ray tube (40 kV, 40 mA), and a Vantec position-sensitive detector and equipped with an Anton Paar HTK 2000 chamber. Measurements were conducted in helium up to 1273 K. From these data, some reactions of decomposition were characterized and the material's coefficients of thermal expansion calculated.</p><p>X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES). XANES measurements were performed at the Rossendorf BeamLine (ROBL) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> Small amounts (5-10 mg) of powdered sample were mixed with boron nitride (BN) and pressed into pellets for the transition measurements. The storage ring operating conditions were 6.0 GeV and 170-200 mA. A double crystal monochromator mounted with an Si(111) crystal coupled to collimating and focusing Rh coated mirrors was used. XANES spectra were collected at room temperature in transmission mode at the U-L III edge. A step of 0.5 eV was used in the edge region. The E 0 values were taken at the first inflection point by using the first node of the second derivative. The position of the white-line maximum was selected from the first node of the first derivative. Several acquisitions were performed on the same sample and summed to improve the signal to noise ratio. Before averaging scans, each spectrum was aligned using the XANES spectra of the metallic Y foil (17038 eV). The ATHENA software <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> was used to remove the background and normalize the spectra. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Experimental Methods. The 23 Na MAS NMR spectra were measured at a Larmor frequency of 105.8 MHz on the 9.4 T spectrometer installed at the JRC-ITU (Joint Research Centre-Institute for Transuranium Elements). This one of a kind spectrometer allows measurement of high-resolution MAS NMR spectra of actinidebearing compounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> A 4 mm probe was used for the NaUO 3 and Na 4 UO 5 compounds, and the rotor was spun at 15 kHz. For Na 2 U 2 O 7 , the NMR measurements were conducted with a 1.3 mm probe at a MAS rate of 55 kHz. A radio frequency field of 42 kHz (π/2, 48 transients with a 0.5 s relaxation delay) was applied to be in the selective excitation regime. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na RIACT MQMAS experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> carried out on Na 2 U 2 O 7 were acquired with optimized excitation and reconversion pulses p 1 = 2.5 μs and p 2 = 4.5 μs. Chemical shifts were referenced to 1 M NaCl(aq). Spectra were fitted using the dmfit software. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> Inorganic Chemistry Theoretical Methods. First-principles calculation of the NMR parameters and geometry optimizations (atomic positions and cell parameters) of the nonmagnetic crystalline compounds Na 4 UO 5 and Na 2 U 2 O 7 were performed using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO package, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> which relies on a pseudopotential plane-wave expansion formalism of density functional theory (DFT). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na electric field gradient (EFG) and magnetic shielding tensors were computed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> and the gauge including projector augmented wave approach (GIPAW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> formalisms, respectively, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PBE functional. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> Core electrons were described by norm-conserving Trouiller-Martins pseudopotentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> and generated with the atomic code (<ref type="url" target="http://www.quantum-espresso.org">http://www.quantum-espresso.org</ref>) using the parameters given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. Before the NMR parameters were computed, their structures were optimized. For all calculations a 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid and kinetic cutoff energy of 120 Ry were used (NMR parameters are converged by &lt;0.5 ppm and &lt;0.05 MHz). As the optimized unit cell volumes were overestimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> by about 4%, the optimized lattice parameters were rescaled (isotropic rescaling) so as to span a unit cell with the experimental volume.</p><p>The isotropic chemical shift, δ iso , was obtained from the isotropic magnetic shielding, σ iso (with σ iso = 1/3Tr/{σ⃡ }), using the following equation: δ iso = -(σ iso -σ ref ).</p><p>As the <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Na is a quadrupolar nucleus (i.e., nuclear spin I = 3/2, greater than 1/2 possess a nonvanishing nuclear quadrupolar moment, denoted Q) it is subjected to the quadrupolar interaction. The latter is characterized by two constants: its (quadrupolar) coupling constant C Q and its asymmetry parameter η Q (which measures the deviation of the EFG from a cylindrical symmetry η Q = 0 (1 ≥ η Q ≥ 0). These parameters are linked with the electric field gradient tensor through C Q = (eQV zz /h) and η Q = V xx -V yy /V zz . The V ii values are the eigenvalues of the (traceless symmetric) EFG tensor ordered according to |V zz | ≥ | V yy | ≥ |V xx | and Q is the nuclear quadrupole moment Q( 23 Na) = 0.104 × 10 -28 m 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were performed with a SETARAM MDHTC96 apparatus equipped with a furnace and a detector monitoring the difference in heat flow between sample and reference crucibles. The Na 2 U 2 O 7 material (55.0 mg) was encapsulated for the measurement in a stainless steel crucible with a screwed bolt to avoid vaporization, as described in another publicaion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> The crucible was brought up to 923 K with heating rates (and respective cooling rates) of 5, 7, and 10 K/ min successively. The temperature was monitored throughout the experiment by a series of interconnected S-type thermocouples.</p><p>■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Text, tables, figures, and CIF files giving X-ray crystallographic data, a detailed description of the room-temperature X-ray diffraction characterization of NaUO 3 , Na 4 UO 5 , and Na 2 U 2 O 7 , </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
