<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vladimir Martis</head><p>Report:</p><p>This report is on an experiment carried out at DUBBLE from 3rd of March till 8th of March 2010.We used combined EXAFS/XRD technique to investigate the structural changes that took place during isothermal hydrothermal reaction of multicomponent mixed metal molybdates .</p><p>Here are presented only data from hydrothermal reaction of Bi 2 MoO 6 at 150 0 C, though an experiment was carried out at another 3 temperatures. The precursor Bi 2 MoO 6 was synthesised by precipitation method. The resulting gel was loaded into hydrothermal cell and then heated at 150 0 C for several hours, until it completely crystallized.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> are shown EXAFS data of formation γ-Bi 2 MoO 6 from amorphous precursor gel at 150 0 C collected at Mo K-edge. It is known that intensities of the pre-edge peak and white line are indicators for determining the coordination environment of Mo (IV) species.</p><p>Initially the EXAFS spectrum was collected from freshly prepared gel at room temperature in order to identify species present in the starting gel. As we can see in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> the EXAFS spectrum in red suggests that tetrahedral species are present in the initial precursor gel because of the strong pre-edge peak (marked as A) and weak shoulder on the top of the edge. The pre-edge peak is higher due to 1s -4d transition in tetrahedrally coordinated system compared to octahedral one (1s-5p transition is lower for tetrahedral compared to octahedral one). During isothermal crystallisation over period of ~ 240 min we can notice the decrease in pre-edge intensity and increase in the intensity of the shoulder on the top of the edge. This corresponds to changes in coordination of Mo(IV) from tetrahedral to octahedral. The EXAFS spectra in blue illustrates Mo(IV) in octahedral coordination.  Inel detector was used for collecting diffraction patterns. XRD patterns were noisy with a poor angular resolution but sufficient for following changes taking place during isothermal crystallisation of amorphous gels. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> is illustrated formation of γ-Bi 2 MoO 6 during hydrothermal reaction at 150 0 C. At time 0 was taken XRD pattern from freshly prepared gel which was amorphous. After 40 min of hydrothermal reaction at 150 0 C the initial gel crystallized and formed the γ-Bi 2 MoO 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sum up</head><p>We were able to collect high quality EXAFS data during isothermal crystallisation of precursor gels. These EXAFS spectra are suitable for complete EXAFS analysis which gives us information about interatomic distances and coordination numbers. We used diffraction measurements for following phase transformation during isothermal crystallisation of gels. Following changes during the isothermal crystallisation of NiMoO 4 at various temperatures didn't work well, as sample never fully crystallized. The rest of data have been analysed and assessed.</p><p>A B</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Mo K-edge EXAFS data of γ-Bi 2 MoO 6 collected during crystallisation at 150 0 C. Red EXAFS spectrum was collected from freshly prepared gel at room temperature. The feature marked as A is characteristic of Mo (IV) in tetrahedral environment. Blue EXAFS spectrum was collected after 240min at 150 0 C.
