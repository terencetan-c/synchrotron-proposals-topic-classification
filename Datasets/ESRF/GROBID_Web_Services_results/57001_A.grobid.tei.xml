<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>characterisation. After the 40 cycles of deposition were realised, we performed a fast characterisation to verify the quality of the layer, and we moved to the deposition of the n layer, alternating synthesis and characterisation. In particular, we performed:</p><p>-XRR before starting the E-ALD of the p layer -XRR after ending the E-ALD of the p layer -l and (h, k) scans on two different Bragg reflections of the CuS phase (every 10 E-ALD cycles of the n layer) -l and (h, k) scans on two different Bragg reflections of the CdS phase (every 10 E-ALD cycles of the n layer) -XRR afte ending the E-ALD of the n layer -X-ray diffraction maps at several relevant l quotes of the obtained junction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Results</head><p>Exemplar h-k X-ray maps of the two ex situ samples are shown in the Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. As it can be noticed, the two samples reveal a complex composite structure, consisting of at least two phases. In both samples, Cd was identified as own phase, well crystallized and well oriented. Cu2S and CuxZnyS revealed the already studied crystal structure of Cu2S, whereas a further additional phase was found, whose lattice parameters are not compatible with already known structure of the considered binary and ternary systems. It is noteworhty to mention that the roughness of the p layer surface, which was found relatively low in the previous experiments, is increased after the 40 E-ALD cycles of CdS over it.</p><p>Coming to the in situ results, we decided to start investigating the CdS/CuS film, because in this system the ex situ sample appeared slightly less complex. We focussed, in fact, at a first attempt, to reduce the complexity of the E-ALD procedure in the in operando characterisation. Preliminary h-k X-ray maps are shown in the following figure.</p><p>An attempt of analysis of the growth process from a crystallographic point of view has been attempted, in fact 3 Bragg peaks has been observed on the plane and out of the plane. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows one of this peak, out of the plane the normalized signal deacreases over the whole deposition of CdS on top of Cu2S. On the plane, the signal seem to be constant, deeper analysis is needed in order to understand possible mistakes about these considerations. The Bragg peaks we considered are broader very little coherence respect to what expected, in particular we cannot be sure of the formation of two different phase very closely related in h,k since the peak expected at 0.73 is not clearly defined. In conclusion, we performed several h-k maps at different l for the ex-situ experiments (CdS/Cu2S, CdS/CuxZnyS and CuxS/CdS) and for the in-situ experiments (CdS/Cu2S and CdS/CuxZnyS). For the CdS/Cu2S apparently, we found two different pattern on the ex-situ h-k maps very close in l, involving also a spatial disorder as shown by the Bragg rings not detected during the ex-situ experiment on Cu2S (MA2082). For the CdS/CuxZnyS apparently, we found three different pattern on the exsitu h-k maps very close in l. Thus, the results doesn't allow the full interpretation of the structure or of the growth process while giving a crucial insight on the materials analyzed by SXRD. Exploiting the results of this experiment we can define the best possible condition for the structural analysis of such composite thin films. Further SXRD experiments will be necessary to get a deeper description of the underlying mechanism of the growth.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 2: (a) l scan and (b) h=k scan on the peak (0.7 0.7 1.15)</figDesc><graphic coords="4,22.95,423.75,267.85,267.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div><head>Aims</head><p>The aim of the present proposal was the in-operando characterization of the growth process and structure of p-n junctions of thin films semiconductors obtained by means of <rs type="programName">Electrochemical Atomic Layer Deposition (E-ALD</rs>). The present experiment represents the first attempt to characterise a p-n junction grown by <rs type="person">E-ALD</rs>. The structural analysis of the films has been carried out both ex situ and in-situ by Surface X-ray Diffraction and X-ray reflectivity.</p></div>
<div><head>Methods (1): experimental set up</head><p>The experiment was performed in the hutch EH1 of the ID03 beamline, using the six circle diffractometer equipped with the ID03 electrochemical flow cell setup (represented in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), already used in our previous experiments <rs type="grantNumber">MA-2082</rs> and <rs type="grantNumber">MA-2251</rs>.</p><p>The experimental set up included the Maxipix detector mounted on the diffractometer arm and a Pilatus 300k-w detector used for fast acquisition of in-plane powder diffraction pattern (covering a 2θ range between 10 and 20 with one single images at the energy of 24 KeV).</p></div>
<div><head>Methods (2): samples</head><p>Two different kind of samples were considered in the experiment: ex situ and in situ films. The ex situ films were realised in the <rs type="institution">Electrochemical Lab at ESRF</rs>, using the electrochemical flow cell setup. Two samples were realised in this set up: <rs type="programName">CdS over CuxS</rs> (hereafter labelled as <rs type="institution" subtype="infrastructure">CdS/CuS) and CdS over CuxZnyS</rs> (hereafter labelled as <rs type="institution" subtype="infrastructure">CdS/CuS</rs>). Samples were realised according to the E-ALD procedure, i.e. alternating the underpotential depositions of the considered elements, assembling layer-by-layer the junction. Equal number of deposition cycles (40) were used for both the p and n layers.</p></div>
<div><head>Methods (3): in situ measurements</head><p>In situ measurements were also realised in the electrochemical flow cell setup, located in the hutch, with the flow cell mounted on the diffractometer. As in our previous experiments we got an exhaustive characterisation of the p layers (<rs type="affiliation">CuS and CuZnS</rs>), we deposited this layer without intermediate</p></div>
