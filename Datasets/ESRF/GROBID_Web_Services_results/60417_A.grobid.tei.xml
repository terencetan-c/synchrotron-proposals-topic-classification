<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REPORT OF THE ESRF EXPERIMENT HC-2646</head><p>Thermal dependence of the structural and microstructural properties of La(Fe1-xMnx)As(O0.89F0.11) samples Selected members of the La(Fe,Mn)As(O0.89F0.11) system were analysed using high resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. As a result, the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition is progressively recovered in the optimally electron-doped LaFeAs(O0.89F0.11) phase by very light Mn-substitution; at the same time, superconductivity is suppressed whereas magnetic ordering is restored. Distinct incommensurate satellite peaks develops within different thermal ranges and mark the occurrence of charge density waves; in particular, some of them arise in conjunction with the structural transformation process. The thermal evolution of the satellite reflections indicates a strong competition between the charge density waves and the superconductive state.</p><p>X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data ( = 0.400020 Å) were collected between 5 K and 295 K (on warming) at the ID22 high-resolution powder diffraction beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).</p><p>Mn-substitution progressively recovers the symmetry breaking that is suppressed in optimally Fdoped compounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As a rule, the structural transition in these compounds is marked by a selective peak splitting of the tetragonal hhl reflections; nonetheless, in some cases only a selective peak broadening of the same tetragonal hhl diffraction lines can be detected, depending on the amplitude of the orthorhombic distortion and/or the instrumental resolution. A closer inspection of the XRPD patterns reveals the presence of some extremely weak Bragg reflections that cannot be indexed by three-integer indices, possibly marking the occurrence of an incommensurate modulated structure involving a CDW state. In particular, these satellite reflections are observed at Q ~ 1.93 Å -1 , ~ 1.975 Å -1 , ~ 2.00 Å -1 and ~ 2.36 Å -1 , but their intensities differently evolve in the different samples, pointing to distinct incommensurate periodicities depending on temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In conclusion, our analysis confirmed the occurrence of incommensurate structures in Fe-based superconductors, as already detected in the homologous La(Fe,Mn)AsO system [1].</p><p>[1] A. <ref type="bibr">Martinelli et al., Phys Rev.
