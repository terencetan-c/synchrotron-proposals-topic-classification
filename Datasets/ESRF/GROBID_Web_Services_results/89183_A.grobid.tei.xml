We were scheduled in February 2018 (12/2 -16/2). Our local contact was Eaazhisai Kandiah. We brought several grids from two different batches, which were pre-screened on our Polara microscope. Unfortuantely, we cannot recover the grids from the Polara to use them on the Titan. In this sense, it is difficult for us to know what the actual grids will look like on the Titan. I am explaining this because we ran into some problems: all the grids we checked at ESRF had a lot of cracked carbon and we had a hard time finding intact squares (without cracks). Thanks to the great support by our local contact we collected data on two different grids and ended up with a bit over 2600 images.</p><p>We had some minor problems related to the K2 camera: at one point, part of the recorded images contained a completely black area -luckily we monitored data collection remotely and noticed the problem relatively soon (the setup to monitor progress of the data collection is extremely useful). I am not sure but it looked like as if part of the camera temporarily failed. Our local contact was able to fix the problem by restarting the camera and computer remotely and we did not loose too much time. On the second day there was a software problem, where EPU was not able to map the holes (at the magnification required to image the grid squares). We started collection anyway because it seemed EPU was still able to find the holes (at the higher magnification required to locate the individual holes). However, our local contact noticed that still many holes were skipped. She was kind enough to select more squares and holes in our absence and continue data collection for us! I would like to emphasise that we would not have been able to get the quality and size of the dataset without the support from Eaazhisai Kandiah. Although we are still refining the structure, we have a reconstruction at about 4Å resolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We could fit X-ray models of RNA polymerase and can see all ligands. One problem we face is that the RNA 3'-end seems disordered and/or degraded.</p><p>We have since performed additional biochemical experiments and ordered new and chemically modified RNA oligonucleotides that give greater chemical stability and result in a more homogenous sample (according to our transcription assays). We would like to collect data on this complex and hence I would like to apply for more time on the Titan KRIOS at ESRF. Unfortunately, the reconstruction did not resolve the 3'-end of the RNA transcript in the active site (not shown).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.: A reconstruction of functional RNA polymerase complex resulting form data collected at ESRF.
