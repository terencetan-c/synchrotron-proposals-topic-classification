<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The general aim of the experiment was to probe charge transfer at the electrochemical interface using resonant surface x-ray diffraction. A fundamental understanding of the nature of the charge transfer, especially the influence of the applied potential and the screening by the electrolyte, is a major goal in electrochemistry (which is itself a key enabler in many energy technologies) and we expect the results to have a significant scientific impact. After previous measurements on the I/Au(111) system we had identified halide adsorption onto Cu(001) electrodes as the ideal system in which to attempt this measurement, as the halides, Br and Cl, both form simple ordered c(2x2) adlayers on the Cu(001) surface. These measurements demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment and are very exciting in that clear shifts in the resonance behaviour can be observed for Cl adsorption but not Br adsorption. This indicates a difference in the bonding mechanism despite the identical nature of the atomic structure.</p><p>Illustrative figures are shown below. For both Cl and Br adsorption onto Cu(001) the adsorbates form c(2x2) adlayers, which are simple square structures with a coverage of 0.5 halide atoms per surface Cu atom and adsorption uniquely into the 4-fold Cu hollow site. The c(2x2) cell gives rise to additional surface scattering that is independent from the Cu crystal truncations rods (CTR's). Due to the symmetry of the surface the contribution to the superstructure scattering is due to the halide anion and the second (subsurface) atomic layer of Cu atoms which are buckled. In the experiment it is therefore possible to probe the surface Cu atoms, by performing resonant measurements at the 'anti-Bragg' positions of the Cu CTR's (in this case the (1, 1, L) CTR which has Bragg reflections at L=1,3,â€¦..) and the sub-surface Cu atoms (second atomic layer) by performing resonant measurements at the c(2x2) superstructure positions. The c(2x2) structure forms at the open circuit potential, i.e. when no potential is applied across the interface so it was at this potential that we initially performed the resonant x-ray measurements.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the resonant diffraction data through the Cu K edge (8979 eV) measured at different positions along the (1, 1, L) CTR, i.e. at L=0.8 close the the Bragg peak where the contribution is dominated by the bulk Cu atoms, down to L=0.2 which is very close to the anti-Bragg position at (1, 1, 0) where the scattering from the bulk of the Cu crystal is essentially cancelled and the surface signal dominates. Clearly at this surface-sensitive position a shift in the adsorption edge can be seen indicative of a change in the charge state of the surface Cu atoms. These results are currently being analyzed using calculation of the structure factors (including the anomalous dispersion corrections obtained from simultaneous measurements of the fluorescence from the bulk Cu crystal and measurements of Cu standards, e.g. CuBr). Figures <ref type="figure">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref> compare the resonant measurements made at two positions on the (1, 1, L) CTR for Cl and Br adsorbates (in both cases the c(2x2) structure was formed). At (1, 1, 0.8) (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) the results are essentially identical, which is expected since the measurement is probing the bulk Cu environment. At (1, 1, 0.2), however, the scattering from the bulk is cancelled and the signal arises from the surface Cu atoms and the adsorbed halide adlayer, Due to the differences in the atomic form factors for Cl and Br the changes in the atomic form factor either lead to a descrease in the scattering through the resonance (Cl) or an increase (Br). What is clear, however, that for Br (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) there is no shift in the edge compared to Cl. This data is currently being analysed both using a simple interpretation (in terms of shifts in the oxidation states of the surface Cu atoms) together with a more sophisticated approach using density functional theory to calculate the surface density of states with subsequent input into the resonant x-ray intensity calculations.
