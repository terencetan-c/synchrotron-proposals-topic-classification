<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A</head><p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for numerous infections. Antibiotic abuse, leading to the outbreak of multiresistant bacteria and the intrinsic resistance of this pathogen to antibiotics, led to a multiplication of infections by P. aeruginosa. This Gram-negative bacteria secretes a number of virulence factors such as degradation enzymes and toxins including exotoxin A which is a major virulence factor and could be used for immunisation against P. aeruginosa. The mechanisms of exotoxin A translocation across the two bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic membrane is performed using a typical type II pathway with three different stages. The unfolding of the protein is required for the translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm through the inner membrane. Several mutants of exotoxin A devoid of different disulphide bonds have been studied by SAXS in order to see their importance on the folding of the protein when it should pass the membrane.</p><p>The experiments carried out on ID02 have shown a slight aggregation of the mutants. However, we could anyway see that the radius of gyration of the different mutants compared to that of exotoxin wild type was not significantly altered by removal of the corresponding disulphide bonds. This suggest that the protein needs a further unfolding to cross the membrane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Natively unfolded nucleoprotein of Measles Virus</head><p>The Measles virus is an important human pathogen responsible for 1 million deaths per year in the world, especially in the developing countries and up to now there is no therapeutic treatment. We have therefore undertaken a study of the replicative complex of this virus. The replicative complex of the Measles virus is made of the nucleoprotein (N), which encapsidates the single-strand RNA genome to form a helical nucleocapsid, and by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which acts in association with the phosphoprotein (P). A computational analysis of the Nucleoprotein N indicates that the C-terminal moiety of N, N TAIL , is natively unfolded. Moreover, circular dichroism experiments performed on N TAIL showed that there is no secondary structure. We have therfore carried out SAXS experiments on N TAIL in order to measure its degree of compaction and to determine whether it was a random coil or not.</p><p>The radius of gyration of N TAIL extrapolated at zero concentration (guinier plots on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) was 27.5 ± 0.7 Å and the deduced Molecular mass (M w ) was 15,250 Da, which is in perfect agreement with the expected M w for a monomeric form (15,300 Da). The expected R g of N TAIL according to its M w would be 15 Å for a globular protein and around 35-38Å for a denatured, fully unfolded protein. Therefore, the observed R g indicated that N TAIL is not globular. However, the protein is more compact than a random coil, suggesting that it possess some residual structure.</p><p>The Kratky plot of N TAIL displays a bump at q≈0.08Å -1 followed by a plateau for q&gt; 0.15 Å -1 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The absence of a maximum clearly indicates that N TAIL is not globular and does not posses a tightly packed core. However, the observed bump may be indicative as well of some residual structure. We determined the distance distribution function, deduced from the scattering intensities of N TAIL , which had a bell-shape, with a maximum dimension D max of 120-130 Å. This value, while being indicative of an extended, non globular conformation, is lower than expected for a random coil. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A B</head><p>All these results, together with the data obtained by circular dichroism indicate that N TAIL does not behave as a random coil but adopts a typical non globular, premolten globule conformation in solution. N TAIL probably displays residual structures that would initiate the induced folding when in presence of its physiological partner.</p><p>These results have lead to the publication an article :</p><p>S.
