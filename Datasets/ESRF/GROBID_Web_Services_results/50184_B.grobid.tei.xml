<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiments were performed both on neat [Fe(mepy) 3 tren](PF 6 ) 2 and on the diluted system [Fe x Zn 1-x (mepy) 3 tren](PF 6 ) 2 (x=0.37). Icing was sometimes problematic but for each system we were able to collect good datasets as a function of the laser power. From these dataset, structural model could be found at each laser power. The evaluation of the power dependence using a mean-field approach allowed extrapolation of the lightinduced structure to a HS fraction of 100%. The extrapolated structural parameters are in very good agreement with those of the analogous zinc compound as well as with the related system having a lifetime of several hours at 10 K. The mean-field model parameters for the cooperative effects extracted from the dynamic photocrystallographic study agrees with those independently collected from the thermodynamic treatment of the thermal spin transition. This protocol was successfully applied to the neat compounds and to the diluted one, and both experiment allowed with the corresponding reference structures also allowed an accurate determination of the molecular structure of the short-lived HS state.</p></div>
