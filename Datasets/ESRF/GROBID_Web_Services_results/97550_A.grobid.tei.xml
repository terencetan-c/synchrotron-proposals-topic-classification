<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>unconventional sodium and potassium halides (like Na3Cl, NaCl3, and KCl3) at pressures of 20 to 70 GPa indicate that chemical relations in alkali halides systems may be very different from those know from classical chemistry. In particular, usually extremely chemically stable halite, NaCl, may become reactive at high pressure that may result in the synthesis of novel compounds with potentially unusual electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.</p><p>In order to test this hypothesis, we loaded a rare earth metal yttrium and dried NaCl powder into a DAC with a pressure chamber of 120 μm in diameter made in a rhenium gasket pre-indented to the thickness of 30 μm. The mixture was compressed to 41 GPa.</p><p>After double-side laser heating of the sample to ~2000 K with a YAG laser, the samples were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The SCXRD data allowed us to identify a new phase among other reaction products. The structure of the new rhombohedral phase (space group #166, R3 ̅ m , a=3.364(2) Å, c=17.72(7) Å in the hexagonal setting; the rhombohedral cell parameters are a=b=c=6.21 Å, α=β=γ=31.46°) was solved and refined to R1=7.5% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>According to the result of SCXRD data analysis, the chemical composition of the phase is Y2CCl. Theoretical calculations perfectly reproduce the details of the Y2CCl structure at 40 GPa and demonstrate that the phase is dynamically stable at the synthesis pressure.</p><p>In the structure of the novel carbidochloride, yttrium atoms form a distorted cubic close packing (ccp) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). If one considers Cl and C as equal balls, the alternating closepacked layers of C and Cl also form a distorted ccp (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Thus, the structure can be described as of the distorted NaCl (B1) type with carbon and chlorine atoms forming  The synthesis of Y2CCl by a direct reaction of Y and NaCl in a laser-heated DAC suggests that sodium chloride indeed not chemically inert at high pressures and temperatures. That limits alkali halides application as thermal insulation and pressure medium materials in DACs experiments at high temperatures, but opens up great perspectives for the synthesis of novel materials with unusual chemistry.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>the ccp, whose octahedral voids are occupied by Y atoms. The Y-C contacts (~2.30 Å) are significantly shorter than Y-Cl (~2.59 Å), as expected. One of the Y-Y contacts is relatively short (~3.14 Å) that is close to the Y-Y distances in yttrium metal, thus indicating possible metallic character of the material.</figDesc></figure>
