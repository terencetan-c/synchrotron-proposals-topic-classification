<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cysteine regulatory complex (CRC), isolated from Salmonella typhimurium and Planctomyces limnophilus and was characterized as a multi-enzyme assembly comprised of two oligomeric enzymes, serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and O-acetylserine sulfhyrdrylase (OASS), that drive the last two steps of cysteine synthesis. SAT is a critical enzyme in the formation of cysteine in plants and bacteria, but not in vertebrates, and as such, it might be a good target for novel antibacterial drugs. Five simulated hit compounds were acquired and evaluated against Salmonella and Planctomyces SAT. In a 96-well plate format, a screening approach employing Ellman's reagent to indirectly quantify SAT activity was established, giving five compounds with a concentration of 1µM and 10µM in the case of Salmonella.The results obtained from this study is interestingly good and need crystallography data to support our research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Application for beam time at ESRF -Experimental Method</head><p>Cysteine regulatory complex (CRC), isolated from Salmonella typhimurium and was characterized as a multi-enzyme assembly comprised of two oligomeric enzymes, serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and Oacetylserine sulfhyrdrylase (OASS), that drive the last two steps of cysteine synthesis. SAT is a critical enzyme in the formation of cysteine in plants and bacteria, but not in vertebrates, and as such, it is proposed to be a good target for novel antibacterial drugs. Five simulated hit compounds were acquired and evaluated against Salmonella. In a 96-well plate format, a screening approach employing Ellman's reagent to indirectly quantify SAT activity was established, giving few compounds with a inhibition concentration of 1μM and 10μM in Salmonella. The results obtained from this study is very promising and we need crystallography data to study the mechanism of inhibition and develop better inhibitors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background:</head><p>We resolved few crystal structures of the SAT from Salmonella and Plantomyces in both apo and ligated states (unpublished data). We continue to screen computationally predicted selected few compounds. Among those, we have tested five different compounds against StSAT (Salmonella).</p><p>Compounds were incubated with at two different concentrations (1μM and 10.0 μM for StSAT). The final concentration of SAT was ~40ng/well. Control experiments was also carried out in which no SAT protein was added. Nevertheless, 10 minutes time point was selected as the optimal endpoint measurement for calculation of the percent inhibition. The most important finding was the identification of a hit chemical compounds which inhibit SAT. All five compounds exhibited better inhibitory effect on SAT activity in case of Salmonella at 1μM and 10μM. We have used an indirect assay (DTNB assay). with the release of CoASH, SAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl moiety of acetyl-CoA to serine. The dip in absorbance at 232 nm caused by the hydrolysis of the acetyl-CoA thioester bond can be used to calculate SAT activity. However, because most organic compounds have a high absorbance at 232 nm, this approach is not ideal for screening compound libraries. We employed an indirect test to determine SAT activity since the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA is transferred to serine along with the release of the free thiol CoASH </p></div>			</div>
