<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A new, costum designed setup to study surface induced precipitation (i.e. heterogeneous nucleation) of solid phases from supersaturated aqueous solutions, developed in a collaboration between ISTerre (CNRS &amp; Univ. Grenoble Alpes) and BASF (Germany), was installed and tested for the first time at ID10. This setup allows simultaneous in situ GISAXS &amp; quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. GISAXS provides information about the size and shape of the formed particles, and their evolution over time. The information obtained from the QCM measurements is highly complementary: it allows not only to quantify the deposited mass on the substrate, but also gives information about the elastic properties of the precipitates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The first two days were devoted to the installation of the setup, including beamline (vacuum tube) and beamstop adjustments as well as integration and optimization of the wet chemistry ancillary equipment (connection to peristaltic pump system for flow-through experiments, preparation of stock solutionsetc.). Incident X-rays with an energy of 22 keV were selected in order to cover an appropriate q-range and to have enough transmission through the ~12 mm thick liquid cell. Two photos of the setup are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. First tests with the whole system running were performed to observe CaCO 3 nucleation on bare gold substrates (commercial QCM sensors). A 2D image of X-rays scattered from the substrate and detected by the used Pilatus detector is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The QCM setup contains a liquid cell, which is tightened using a home-made kapton gasket allowing transmission of the X-ray beam. Supersatured solution is flown through the liquid cell using a peristaltic pump and a Y-mixer to combine two stock solutions (e.g. CaCl 2 and NaHCO 3 ). Several technical problems were detected during days 3 and 4, related to (i) a misfunctioning of the Y-mixer (the stock solutions were not mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio), (ii) to the bending of the QCM sensors upon fixation into the fluid cell, and (iii) the need to optimize the beamstop position in order to protect the detector from the reflected beam. Addressing this last issue allowed us to increase our experimental sensitivity to successfully study poorly scattering systems such asCaCO 3 in water. All other problems were also solved or taken into account in data analysis (for example, substrate bending leads to a slightly higher direct beam image on the detector). Note that most of the measurements were performed without one or two of the attenuators, in order to take advantage of a large part of the high flux available at ID10 from the three inline undulators. This highlights the need of a high-flux beamline such as ID10 for the targeted kind of experiments.</p><p>From day 4, a good correlation between QCM and GISAXS data evolution was observed. Subsequently, a series of experiments were performed to study heterogeneous CaCO 3 nucleation (a system previoulsy studied by our group using in situ GISAXS) at different solution conditions (e.g. different levels of supersaturation) and on a variety of substrates with different surface chemistry. These include pure Au, thiol-functionalized Au, and silica substrates. Both solution conditions and surface properties were found to have a strong influence on the kinetics (and mechanisms) of heterogeneous nucleation (as expected). A typical result is highlighted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, where an increase of scattering intensity is observed with time for thiol-functionalized Au substrates. The corresponding change in resonance frequency recorded by the QCM is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.  After this first successful test, a new series of experiments will be designed in order to systematically study heterogeneous nucleation rates for relevant mineral systems such as CaCO 3 , CaSO 4 and silica. Currently, work is in progress to avoid substrate bending and to improve the mixing of stock solutions. Data analysis of QCM and GISAXS is in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
