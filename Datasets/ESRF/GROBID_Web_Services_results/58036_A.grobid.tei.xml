<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Were you able to execute the planned experiments?</head><p>YES; we have been able to perform the planned measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Did you encounter experimental problems?</head><p>NO, we did not encounter any significant problems. However, a technical problem at the ESRF disrupted the data acquisition at about 4:00 on 01/02/2016. Allegedly, a remote restart of ESRF servers impaired experiments at several beamlines. We were not able to restart the acquisition programme with standard procedures and the beamline scientist had to restart the beamline including new energy calibration of the monochromator so that we have not been able to collect more spectra after the incident.</p><p>Furthermore, an unexplainable jump in the recorded beam intensity at the first ionization chamber (I0) when passing an energy of 13250 eV limited the energy range we could use for EXAFS analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Was the local support adequate?</head><p>YES local support was perfect and collaboration with dr. Dipanjan Banerjee was very valuable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned on the project proposal? YES and No. See additional remarks for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Are you planning follow-up experiments at DUBBLE for this project?</head><p>NO this project has been finished, but proposals for new projects have been submitted. 8. Do you expect any scientific output from this experimental session (publication, patent, ..) YES, the results from this experiment will be part of the PhD thesis of drs. Alwina Hoving and the related manuscripts are expected to be submitted until the end of the year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Additional remarks (short summary of preliminary results)</head><p>Samples were measured from experiments in which Boom Clay, or the silt and clay fraction of Boom Clay, were reacted with Se(IV). Prior to the experiments, the Boom Clay had been redox-modified januari 2015</p><p>by chemical oxidation and reduction. Measurements from experiments from untreated Boom Clay material confirmed the results from our previous experiment 26-01-1016: Within the time scale of several days, Se(IV) became reduced to Se(0) as exemplarily shown for the unseparated and untreated Boom Clay in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The presented relative concentrations of the three components are the result of the ITT analysis, which is part of the ITFA software 1 . For obtaining these results, all XANES spectra collected from 35 samples were complemented with a suite of spectra from reference materials. Depending on the loading of the vectors after the varimax rotation, reference spectra, which were related to vectors with low loading on the spectra from the experiments, were stepwise removed until only three spectra of reference material remained. The spectra of the data set with all sample spectra plus the remaining reference spectra can be very well reproduced using three components. The three extracted components by ITT analysis can be assigned to adsorbed Se(IV), red Se(0) and FeSe, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The third component, assigned to FeSe, contributes only marginal to spectra from samples of untreated Boom Clay. However, reproduction of spectra from reduced and oxidized Boom Clay material require the third component. It is expected that chemical reduction of the Boom Clay enhances the reductive capability of the material. It is therefore in line with the expectation that this could lead to the formation of Se(-II) which is the oxidation state of Se in FeSe. It is, however, surprising that the third component is the major Se fraction the most oxidized material (oxidized 2). After one treatment with H 2 O 2 (oxidized 1) the kinetics and extent of Se(IV) reduction decreases. However, several treatments with H 2 O 2 seem to activate a reductive constituent in the material which is capable to reduce Se(IV) to Se(-II). This implies that the capacity to reduce Se(IV) is not necessarily lost when Boom Clay is exposed to chemical oxidants such as H 2 O 2 . Furthermore, chemical redox-modfication of Boom Clay, including oxidation and reduction, appears to activate reductants for Se(IV) in the samples. Activation of these reductants can lead to the formation of other reduction products than Se(0) which is the dominant product of the reaction of Se(IV) with untreated Boom Clay. 1 Rossberg, A.; Reich, T.; Bernhard, G.

Se XANES spectra collected from samples which were retrieved after different reaction times from experiments in which Se(IV) had been added to Boom Clay suspensions. In addition to untreated, unseparated Boom Clay(unmodified), Boom Clay material after chemical reduction (reduced) and after one (oxidized 1) and several (oxidized 2) treatments with H 2 O 2 were used. The lines are the reproduction of the spectra by using three components.
