<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we demonstrate that it is possible to remove a protective o-As layer from a GaAs(001) wafer in an electrolyte (here HsSO*), and to obtain a smooth surface with well defined stoichiometry at the solid/liquid boundary. Using an electrochemical cell of new design, we monitor the reductive etching of the As cap at sufficiently negative potential by x-ray diffraction. For the experiments, n-GaAs(001) wafers with a 1 pm thick homoepitaxial n-type film grown by MBE and protected by a smooth 50 nm thick o-As layer were used. The doping level in film and substrate was 1 x lOr8 cmm3 Si. The samples were cut to a size of M 2 x 2 mm 2 and ohmic contact was made with an In/Zn alloy annealed to the back of the sample. Using epoxy resin, the samples were mounted in a way that only the arsenic capped face was exposed to the electrolyte (0.5 M H 2 S0 4 ). The experiments were performed under potentiostatic control in a three-electrode setup with a saturated calomel reference electrode. The As stripping is performed at an electrode potential of -1.2 V (SCE), where hydrogen is generated strongly at the GaAs surface and a thin-layer electrochemical cell, typically employed for x-ray diffraction measurements', could not be used. Our cell features a hemispherical quartz dome of 1 cm diameter and wall thickness of 100 pm which contains the electrolyte and serves as x-ray window. The x-ray diffraction measurements were performed on the "big kappa" diffractometer at ID11 at 20 keV where a transmission of 50% was obtained. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> the intensity of the x-rays diffracted by GaAs(220) planes which are normal to the GaAs(001) surface is plotted as a function of incident glancing angle oi at a fixed angle of = 0.5" of the outgoing diffracted wave (see inset in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Total reflection of the incident x-ray wave leads to a rapid decay of the diffracted intensity for angles smaller than the critical angle, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. For incident angles oi &gt; o, the ql is real and its value increases with o;. Because the (220) Bragg point lies in the surface plane, and increasing value of q: means a movement along the (221) crystal truncation rod. This is the reason of the slow decay of the intensity on the right side of the intensity profile shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>In order to monitor the stripping of the As cap, the incidence angle was fixed at (Y; -o. = -0.05" on the rapidly decaying part of the curve (see arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and the electrode potential set to -1.2 V (SCE). The intensity of the GaAs(220) surface reflection was recorded as a function of time, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a). A linear increase, a broad maximum and a final decrease of the intensity is observed. The reason for the increase in intensity of the (220) surface reflection, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>(a), is the stripping of the arsenic layer with time. Since the penetration depth de of the x-rays in the a-As cap is constant, the x-ray intensity increases at the GaAs:As interface with decreasing thickness of the layer, thus leading to higher scattering amplitudes from the GaAs(001) substrate. The explanation for the observed maximum in the intensity is based on the structural properties of the interface between the GaAs(001) surface and the arsenic film. Whereas the bulk of the arsenic film is known to be amorphous 2 , the first As layers at the interface may be epitaxially ordered. These layers are thought to be more stable than amorphous As, and will dissolve less easily. Since the thickness of the ordered fraction of the As cap is very small, it will not affect the penetration depth d, to a significant extent; however, etching of the underlying GaAs is inhibited until the film is completely dissolved.</p><p>This explanation is corroborated by the current/time behavior of the etching process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2(b)</ref>). For comparison, a curve obtained under the same electrochemical conditions in our home lab is shown. The current increases with a nearly constant slope for the rising part of the x-ray intensity curve. When the scattering intensity is almost constant, the current increases at a much higher rate, indicating that strongly passivating material is removed from the interface. After the complete removal of the arsenic cap, the electrode current saturates. While the electrical properties remain constant, the morphological properties of the interface change due to some surface roughening, i.e., the scattered intensity goes down. 1.
