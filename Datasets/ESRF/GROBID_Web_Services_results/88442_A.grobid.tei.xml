<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Microtubules are key components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Dynamic conversion between tubulin dimers (free unit protein before assembly in cytoplasm, MW=110,000) and assembled microtubules (polymerized state) occurs in a controlled manner, which modifies intracellular microtubule networks along with the whole cell activities such as cell-migration, shape changes, mitosis, differentiation and so on. Since microtubules are one of the most crucial targets of anti-cancer chemicals (e.g., paclitaxel) that knockout cancer cells, our question is how such tubulin-binding drugs and related derivatives affects the structure of microtubules, and how such binding depends on the chemical states of tubulin dimers during the reaction of GTPhydrolysis. For these purposes, we applied our original technique for the rapid shear-flow alignment of biological filaments <ref type="bibr">(Sugiyama et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kamimura et al 2016)</ref> to observe Xray fiber-diffraction signals from microtubules at higher resolutions (up to 0.45 nm), the Qrange of which is expected to provide us with crucial signals from the internal structures of tubulin molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION</head><p>In the present study, we finihsed the following two improvements in our experimental methods, eventually both improvements worked well as we expected. First, according to the test results obtained during our previous beam time (LS2703, 26-02 852), whch showed a high bachground of scattering at high Q-range, we replaced all the quartz and kapton windows in the apparatus to mica plates. The effects of this improvement were tested during the first session of our beam time (27-29/03/2018). Effects of noise reduction were obvious, in particular, at the Q-range of WAXS signals (&gt;0.5 nm in a reciprocal space). Second, we planned to execute a series of observations of microtubule fiber-diffraction with various tilting angle of specimen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, differently from conventional methods of SAXS or powder scattering, diffractin intensity and angle from aligned biological fibers should vary depending on the tilting angle of specimen (β) against the beam axis of X-ray. Therefore, we can expect the signal position in diffraction pattern moved in an expected manner depending on β+α, where α is the off-set of tilting angle of structures within microtubules. The variable α is expected to have a certain specific value in the case of secondary structures of tubulin (helices or strands), but it should be equal to 0 for the structures regularly arranged in the longitudinal direction of microtubule axis. This approach seems to be working well at the high Q-range (1.25 Å -1 , ~0.5 nm in a reciprocal space) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a (*)</ref>. Further details analysis, changing β in a wide range should be required to test this hypothesis more exactly, and to obtain definitive conclusion which high-Q signals reflects the structural dynamics within tubulin molecules. We thank Ganadería Fernando Díaz for the supply of purified calf brain tubulin, and staff of beamline of BM26 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) for technical supports as well as PSCM (Partnership for soft condensed matter, ESRF) for 3D-printering machine parts used in our shear-flow apparatus.
