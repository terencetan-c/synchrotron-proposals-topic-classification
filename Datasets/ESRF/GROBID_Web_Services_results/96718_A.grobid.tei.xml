<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The production of chemicals from biomass-based sugars has emerged an important research topic in the last decades. A key reaction, known as Retro-Aldol Condensation (RAC), allowing the synthesis of short-chain oxygenated compounds has been extensively investigated. 1 The main product of this reaction is ethylene glycol, a C 2 molecule, obtained through the hydrogenation of glycolaldehyde intermediate. Homogenous tungsten-and molybdenum-based monooxyanions and polyoxyanions such as (WO 4 2-, MoO 4 2-, W 12 O 40 8-, Mo 7 O 24 6-, …) are efficiently selective catalysts for this reaction. Tungstate precursors are still more selective than molybdenum ones despite the similarity of the chemical properties of both metals. However, tungstate and molybdate do not show, strictly, the same behavior in aqueous solution. Tungstate tends to form more easily polyanions than molybdate. 2,3 Therefore, a deeper investigation at a molecular scale was required to comprehend this dissimilarity. An operando study of the activity of both metals for the conversion of glucose to glycolaldehyde was undertaken on the FAME beamline in ESRF using a dedicated cell for liquid samples developed by the team members 4 (experimental report n° 30-02-1150). A follow up of the existing W/Mo species in the presence of sugar under relevant conditions for RAC during the course of the reaction was carried out using High Energy resol ved Fluorescence detection XANES at L 3 -edge for tungsten and K-edge for molybdenum.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Samples prepared at standard conditions consist of aqueous solution s of 5 mmol/L of glucose and 1.32 mmol/L of W or Mo. The experiments occurred conventionally at 150°C and 40 bars of He inert atmosphere. The influence of a set of various parameters on the activity of W and Mo oxyanions was investigated (Temperature, pH of the reaction medium, metal concentration). XANES spectra were recorded during the reaction each 8 min at an interval of time of 1 to 2 hours depending on the temperature of th e experiment. Ex situ analysis were performed for 3 tungstate and 2 molybdate solid precursors for which the geometry and the oxidation state of the metallic center are well known. The EXAFS spectra of these reference catalysts were recorded in a transmission mode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). For tungstate precursor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) the white line is either splitted or not depending on the structure of WO x unit. Sodium tungstate (Na 2 WO 4 ) consisting of four-fold coordinate tungsten sites exhibit one peak while tungsten (six-fold coordinated tungsten sites) centers of ammonium metatungstate (AMT) catalyst display a white line clearly consisting of two peaks. The splitting of the white line into two peaks is attributed to the existence of distorted octahedral structure that has an Oh symmetry. The largest difference between the spectra of the 3 catalysts is the shift of the L 3 -edge maximum by 1.2 eV to higher energies when going from WO 2 , for which the tungsten atom is of 4+ oxidation state, to AMT and Na 2 WO 4 catalysts whose tungsten centers are of 6+ oxidation state. As for molybdenum-based precursors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the spectrum exhibited by sodium molybdate (Na 2 MoO 4 ) represents an intense pre-edge while ammonium heptamolybdate (HMA) catalyst displays a signal with a blurry pre-edge. Molybdenum can be either located in four-fold coordinated sites as in the case of Na 2 MoO 4 or in six-fold coordinated sites as in the case of HMA. The less the environment is centrosymmetric, the more intense is the pre-edge peak, as it is seen by comparing the pre-edge feature of the tetrahedrally coordinated Na 2 MoO 4 and the octahedral molybdenum center of HMA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>For the conversion of glucose over AMT catalyst at 150°C we observed an unchanged signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) during the reaction and all the spectra were coincident with the spectrum displayed by a reference aqueous solution of AMT at ambient temperature ([W] = 1.32 mmol/l). Although, in the case of the reaction over HMA catalyst, molybdenum sites have shown a change of structure during the course of the reaction. This evolution has been characterized by an increase and a decrease of the pre -edge intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4-A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>) and the presence of isosbestic points indicating a change of molybdate species (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4-A</ref> and <ref type="figure">C</ref>). According to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, before the beginning and after 8 min of reaction time, the spectra showed a blurred pre -edge similar to the pre-edge of HMA spectra in which molybdenum sites are octahedrally coordinated metal centers. At 16 min till the end of the reaction, the spectra have suddenly adopted the shape of a tetrahedrally coordinated metal site signal by showing the formation of an intense pre-edge. Then, when the reaction medium has been put back to the ambient temperature, the spectrum got back in a shape of an HMA spectrum. Such observation As a preliminary conclusion, under relevant conditions for RAC, tungstate species are probably octahedrally coordinated speci es, while molybdate anions are tetrahedral sites. The treatment of data is still ongoing, and it must be completed by further theoretical studies (DFT calculations) and experimental RAMAN measurements to clearly points the structural difference leading to the dissimilarity of the activity of both metals.
