<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The mining activity on the Iberian Pyritic Belt (Portugal and Spain) is known since Phoenician times, and was more intense during the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula (for Gold) and after the industrial revolution (for gold, copper, zinc, lead and sulphur).</p><p>The commonest ore of this region is a massive polymetalic sulphide accumulation, where pyrite (FeS 2 ) is the main mineral, with variable concentrations of chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2 ), sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), arsenopyrite (FeAsS 2 ) and other sulphides and sulfosalts. Furthermore, the ore compositions include several minor elements like Mn, Co, Ni, Se, Cd, Sb, Te, Hg and Bi. Some of the main and minor elements of these ores are hazardous and the drainage basins of pollutant source areas often induce health concerns in the resident population <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The problem is particularly serious at the abandoned mine of S. Domingos (southern Portugal) where the acid mine drainage is very intense. Moreover, since the main exploration purpose was the extraction of sulphur, large piles of metals-enriched slag were left "in-situ" for at least forty years. The soil contamination is so strong that several square kilometres exhibit a complete depletion of vegetation resembling a desert-area or display small clusters of metal hyper-accumulator plant species.</p><p>The present experiment focuses on iron and lead elements and on slags and their weathering products. The first element is a major constituent of these materials and its speciation must constrain the behaviour of pollutant cations. The lead is a hazardous element, highly mobile that harmful consequences on live is wellknown.</p><p>The instrumental set-up of BM-29 beamline was used to collect absorption spectra in transmission and fluorescence mode at Fe K and Pb LIII edges. Slags (come apart by grain size) and their weathering products are the main centre of our attention in this experiment. But in order to modelling the various speciations of both metals, spectra was collected in model compounds (glass, Pb-jarosite, jarosite and others oxyhydroxides, oxides and sulphate minerals phases)with known environment of iron and lead ions, figuring out different geometries and bond distances of oxygen, hydroxyls and water molecules. The samples was crushed and pelletized with BN. A total of 91 useful summed EXAFS Fe K and Pb LIII edges spectra were collected from model compounds, slags, weathering products and sediments.   The model compound glass (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and Pb-Jarosite (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) seems constrain almost all the variability of the Pb speciation on the abandoned nine of S. Domingos materials.</p><p>The slags are granulometrically sieved, in the fraction where the grain is bigger than 0,5 mm (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>), the Pb shows an X-ray absorption pattern similar to Pb in glass (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>). By the other side, the fraction inferior to 45 µm is similar to Pb-jarosite in what concern to Pb-L III X-ray absorption (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). But it is clearly that each spectrum must have others contributions.</p><p>The sediment transported by the drainage system shows also Pb-L III spectra (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>) that resembles the Pbjarosite spectra. This aspect support the hypothesis that jarosite is the main Pb retainer in the region of S. Domingos abandoned mine, after the slags weathering Further work on Fe K-edge Pb LIII-edge is in progress. The reliability of data in other samples is been tested and Linear combination fitting is carrying out. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3</figDesc></figure>
