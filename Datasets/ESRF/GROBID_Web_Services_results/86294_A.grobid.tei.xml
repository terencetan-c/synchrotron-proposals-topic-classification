<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Supported bimetallic nanoparticles (BMNPs) often exhibit improved catalytic activity, selectivity and/or durability compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects. However, these effects require a precise control on the size, shape and composition of the BMNPs during synthesis. Recently, atomically precise synthesis of supported BMNPs has been achieved by ALD, a vapour phase deposition method. In colloboration with DUBBLE, we recently developed a strategy for the preparation of alloys containing a non-noble metal next to Pt 1 (selected as one of the ESRF Highlights of 2016). The present campaign aimed at extending this ALD-route to noble-metal-free compounds, such as Ni-Fe and Ni-Ga. In view of their catalytic importance, a systematic study was carried out to study how the final particle size, shape and distribution can be controlled by varying the ALD and annealing conditions. In addition to experiments related to the proposed research topic of Ni-based BNMPs, two additional research topics have been addressed during this campaign. Firstly, in situ GISAXS was performed during annealing of Pt NPs with Al 2 O 3 overcoats (remaining experiments of a previous study (26-02-726) that were needed to finalize a manuscript). Secondly, exploring a new topic in view of future synchrotron beam time proposals, we deposited Au NPs via ALD while performing in situ GISAXS at the DUBBLE beamline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Our dedicated vacuum chamber, described in ref. 2, was used for the ALD and annealing experiments. The energy of the X-ray beam was set to 12.7 keV (we aimed for 12.0 keV, but we found that the monochromator had an offset of 0.7 keV), and the detector-to-sample distance to 4.2 m. The beam size was 1 x 0.5 mm 2 (H x V) at the sample position. In view of our first objective (Ni-Fe BMNP synthesis), a series of Fe 2 O 3 /NiO bilayer samples were prepared in our lab at Ghent University (UGent). TBF and Ni(MeCp) 2 precursors were used for Fe 2 O 3 and NiO ALD, respectively, and O 2 plasma was used as reactant. The deposition temperature was 200 o C on Si with native oxide. The thickness and composition [described as Ni wt% = Ni/(Ni + Fe)] of the bilayer samples were determined by XRF measurements at UGent. At DUBBLE, the as-deposited Fe 2 O 3 /NiO bilayers were subjected to a temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) in H 2 to 700 °C using a ramp rate of 0.2 °C/s while the formation of Ni x Fe y BMNPs was monitored with in situ GISAXS. For the second objective, Pt NPs with distinct size and spacing but same Pt loading were pre-prepared on SiO 2 surfaces. Finally, Au ALD was performed at DUBBLE on Si with native oxide at 120°C using Au(CH 3 ) 3 P(CH 3 ) 3 as the precursor and O 2 plasma or H 2 plasma as the reactant. In situ XRF and GISAXS measurements were performed during the ALD process at an incidence angle of 0.5°.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In situ GISAXS during reduction of Ni-Fe bilayers Bilayer samples with three different compositions, Ni wt% ~ 75, 50 and 35, were prepared by changing the NiO and Fe 2 O 3 thicknesses (dNiO and dFe 2 O 3 , Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref> shows in situ XRD data recorded during the TPR of a Fe 2 O 3 /NiO bilayer with ~ 75 wt% Ni. At 450°C, the diffractions of NiO disappear and Ni 3 Fe is formed. A similar experiment for a bilayer consisting of ~ 50 wt% Ni resulted in a NiFe phase, demonstrating that our approach enables tuning of the Ni-Fe alloy composition. Similar samples were then annealed at DUBBLE while recording in situ GISAXS patterns using 30 s measurements (α i = 0.5°). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> shows the evolution of the scattering features while annealing. Iniatially a very faint scattering lobe is visible, attributed to the rougness of the as-deposited film. At 450 o C, i.e. the onset of alloying as indicated by in situ XRD, the scattering lobe clearly shifts to lower q y values and increases in intensity. These observations indicate that the formation of particles occures upon reduction. In view of catalytic applications, the size tuning of the Ni x Fe y BMNPs was investigated by preparing bilayers with different total thicknesses, but with same compositions. SEM and in situ GISAXS measurements revealed the formation of smaller particles with decreasing dTotal. In situ GISAXS measurements also revealed that the alloying temperature decreases with increasing Ni wt%.</p><p>We propose that during the annealing the NiO gets reduced to Ni first, which then facilitates the reduction of Fe 2 O 3 and eventually the formation of alloyed BMNPs. . With this last experiment, we confirmed that the particle size evolution during annealing depends only on the particle size and not on the particle preparation or thermal history, since after heating to 600 ºC, then overcoat and annealing, the particle size evolution behaves similarly to the as deposited Pt-A with 10 Å of Al 2 O 3 overcoat.</p><p>In situ GISAXS during ALD of Au NPs: In a published work by Griffiths et al. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> , it is shown that supported Au NPs with a bimodal size distribution can be obtained by using Au(CH 3 ) 3 P(CH 3 ) 3 as precursor and O 2 plasma (O 2 * ) as reactant. Recently, we discovered at UGent that the same precursor can also be used in combination with H 2 plasma (H 2 * ) to grow Au NPs. Ex situ SEM showed that the NP coverage for both processes is quite different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3a</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3b</ref>), motivating the interest for studying these processes with in situ XRF and GISAXS. The Au/O 2 * process results in a combination of larger particles with a large inter-particle distance and smaller particles with a small inter-particle distance. The Au/H 2 * leads to a more uniform particle distribution and a small inter-particle distance. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3c</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3d</ref> show the in situ GISAXS results for the Au/O 2 plasma process and the Au/H 2 plasma process, respectively (cuts along q y ). The q yposition of the scattering maximum for the Au/O 2 * process appears around 0.25 nm -1 and stays at this position for the entire ALD process, consistent with the large spacing of the Au NPs in the SEM images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3a</ref>). A lobe for the expected smaller particles is not present, probably because scattering mainly occurs between the larger particles with a large inter-particle distance. For the Au/H 2 * process the lobe appears around q y = 1.0 nm -1 and shifts with increasing number of ALD cycles to lower q y values. This shows that the morphology of the surface changes during the ALD process, starting with particles that have a small inter-particle distance which merge during the process creating larger particles with a larger inter-particle distance.</p></div>

Supported Pt NPs with same loading but distinct initial particle size (i.e. Pt-A and Pt-B) were prepared via ALD. In previous campaigns, we investigated the effect of the O 2 partial pressure and the as-deposited morphology on the particle size evolution during annealing up to 1000 o C in different partial pressures of O 2 in He.3  We also investigated how a thin Al 2 O 3 overcoat (few Å) via ALD increases the onset temperature for particle coarsening during annealing in 18% O 2 /He. Here, we performed additional in situ GISAXS experiments to finish this overcoat investigation (Fig.2): i) annealing of the as-deposited samples (Pt-A and Pt-B); ii) overcoat Pt-A and Pt-B with 10 Å of Al 2 O 3 and annealing; and iii) Pt-B annealing up to 600 º C to reach a particle size equivalent to the as deposited Pt-A (Fig.2black line (arrow 1)), and then overcoat with 10 Å of Al 2 O 3 and anneal up to 1000 ºC (Fig.2black line (arrow 2)). With this last experiment, we confirmed that the particle size evolution during annealing depends only on the particle size and not on the particle preparation or thermal history, since after heating to 600 ºC, then overcoat and annealing, the particle size evolution behaves similarly to the as deposited Pt-A with 10 Å of Al 2 O 3 overcoat.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.35,63.00,253.60,152.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>
