<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to map the spatial distribution of first order martensitic transformation induced by various loading conditions in superelastic NiTi wires of diameter 0.1-0.2 mm. We focused our experiments on tension, combined tension/torsion and bending loading conditions. The bending conditions were reached by using a specific snake-like wire shape while the other conditions were applied to straight wires. To probe the spatial distributions of parent austenite (cubic, B2) and stress induced either R-phase (trigonal) or martensite (monoclinic, B19') structure, the NiTi wire gauge volume was scanned with a microbeam (~20um x 5 um) in two directions. The volume distributions were reconstructed while assuming the axial symmetry (tension, tension/torsion) or planar symmetry (bending).</p><p>The post-processing of collected 2D diffractograms was performed using batch processing based on PyFAI library used for calibration and 2D diffractogram integration and Maud and GSAS softwares used for Quantitative phase analysis applied on fully integrated diffraction spectra.</p><p>NiTi wire under bending Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> presents the experimental setup aimed at analysing distributions of R-phase and martensite induced by bending of a snake-like shape set NiTi wire. Here a gauge volume of 0.5x0.12 mm was scanned by microbeam as shown in the inset figure in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. 2D diffractograms collected from each scanned point, where fully integrated and subsequently analysed by Rietveld refinment in order to obtain the volume fraction of three considered phases -austenite, R-phase, martensite. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> show colormap resulting from Rietveld refinement that actually proves that tension-compression asymmetry effectively shifts the neutral axis of the bending deformation from the wire axis. The results also allowed to calibrate material model of the constitutive behaviour of superelastic NiTi as published in [1]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NiTi wire under combined tension/compassion</head><p>The post-processing approach adopted in the case of bent NiTi wire was also applied on 2D diffractograms collected in-situ on superelastic NiTi wire subjected to combined tension/torsion with different loadings rations. The analysis is actually still in processes.</p><p>In fact, the development of reliable programming codes for post-processing of thousands of collected 2D diffractograms have been time consuming and, therefore, we postponed the report elaboration until first results and publications were available.</p></div>
