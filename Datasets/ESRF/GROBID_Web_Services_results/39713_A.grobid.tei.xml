<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>EXPERIMENT MX-805 on ID14-2 (05-12-2008/07-  In this experiment we have analyzed the photoreduction of Ngb, recording optical spectra before and during X-ray exposure. We also attempted the determination of the structure of the photolytic intermediate of NgbCO (NgbCO*).</p><p>Experimental set-up:</p><p>3 2 1 1) Loop mounted crystal 2) On-line microspectrophotometer 3) Helium-jet</p><p>The first 24 hours were dedicated to setting up the beamline: Helium-jet installation and microspectrophotometer installation and alignment were carried out. This work has been possible due to the strategic collaboration of Peter Van Der Linden, from the Experimental Support Group and Martin Weik from the IBS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection:</head><p>We have mounted Ngb crystals in the ferric form and we have recorded optical spectra with the online microspec before and during X-ray exposure, as shown in figure 1. We have followed the photoreduction of protein caused by X-ray flux. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> represents the photoreduction of met-Ngb crystals kept at 30 K.   In this part of the experiment the formation of ice on the crystal surface has been much more detrimental than during off-line spectrophotometric measurements. This was probably due to the geometry of the system and to the rotation of the sample during data collection that increased gas turbulences, enhanced by the need to change manually the temperature adjusting the needle valve of the He-jet. It was very difficult to reach 15K and it was impossible to carry out data collection at this temperature. Consequently we could not attempt data collection in conditions where the photolytic intermediate NgbCO* is trapped. Data statistics from collection carried out at 30K show that crystals diffract to 1.8 Å resolution (see table below), allowing the determination of the structure with the detail necessary to detect CO docked within the protein matrix, as expected in the photolytic intermediate NgbCO*. In conjunction with the data reporting the experimental session at the Cryobench, we could nevertheless assess the feasibility of the determination of the structure of NgbCO*, provided that the performance of the He-stream is improved, eliminating the severe icing effect. Experiment set-up: Instead of the standard setup with a nitrogen stream, we have used a helium-jet to achieve temperatures as low as 15K, keeping in mind that this is the nominal temperature of the instrument controller. The actual temperature of the sample was not measured, but it is likely to be higher, although in the same range.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection:</head><p>The first samples analyzed were Ngb crystals in the ferric form (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>). Subsequently spectra from Ngb crystals in the ferrous form (reduced with Na dithionite) were collected. The absorption spectra of these two crystal forms have the typical aspect of met-Ngb and ferrous Ngb, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.  A photolytic intermediate of NgbCO (NgbCO* ) was observed by FTIR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, this state can be trapped only at temperatures lower than 40K, since at higher temperatures geminate rebinding does not allow it to be populated. As far as spectrophotometric measurements are concerned, the NgbCO* should correspond to a deoxy pentacoordinated species, which is very different from the deoxy hexacoordinated species shown in figures 1 and 3, that is also the spectrum observed in solution.</p><p>Indeed Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> shows a spectrum at 15K that corresponds to a deoxy pentacoordinated state, which so far has never been observed for Ngb in crystals, indicating that the even the lamp probe of the microspectrophotometer is sufficient to achieve full photolysis and consequently we were able to trap the, NgbCO* species at 15K. Consistently, at temperatures higher than 30K, geminate rebinding becomes dominant, leading to a spectrum that corresponds to the NgbCO spectrum as reported in the literature. In order to confirm that the spectum reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> corresponds to NgbCO* we tested its reversibility, by cycling the temperature induced transition from 15K to 30K and vice versa. The transition from photolitic intermediate NgbCO* at 15 K to Ngb CO-bound at 30 K was clearly followed, with full reversibility, after several cycles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref>). The temperature was varied manually, rotating the 'needle valve' of the Helium-jet because the computerized controller was not available. This posed a problem, because the change of temperature is connected with a brutal change of helium flux, enhancing the formation of ice on the crystals. Crystal icing and mechanical microfluctuation due to gas flux led to a variation of the focus and optic length, thus affecting the quality of the spectra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The experimental session was very successful, since we obtained the data we were aiming to: spectra of different species of Ngb in crystals and isolation and characterization of the temperature stability of the NgbCO* photolytic intermediate. The optical spectra of Ngb, always correspond to an hexacoordinated form, since in the absence of a gaseous ligand such as CO, O 2 or NO the proximal histidine occupies the sixth coordination position. For the first time a pentacoordinated state was trapped in the crystal (the NgbCO* species). This result is interesting per se and demonstrates the feasibility of the determination of the 3D structure of this photolytic intermediate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1Absorption spectra of photoreduction of met-Ngb crystals kept at 30 K that have been taken before and after X-ray irradiation at 13.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> KeV with a flux of 7.3 X 10 -9 photons s -1 and focused beam.
