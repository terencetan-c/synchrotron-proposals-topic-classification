<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It seems that we can now formulate very general trend in the thermal decomposition of many coordination compounds. In inert atmosphere, compounds are stable up to relatively high temperatures and form metallic products directly without formation of visible crystalline intermediates. In reductive atmosphere, fcc-structured metallic products can be found at relatively low temperatures with a mixture of (NH 4 ) 2 [MCl 6 ] as the main crystalline intermediate. Further heating results in a formation of fcc-structured alloys which decompose to fcc+hcp mixtures at high temperature according to equilibrium metallic phase diagrams. Early studies of thermal behaviour of coordination compounds were based on sporadic TG-DSC and ex situ PXRD (mainly in house), IR and Raman data. Previously in the literature, opposite trends were proposed: sequentional formation of several intermediates in inert atmosphere and absence of any cristalline structurally characterizable intermediates in reductive environment. Likely, some intermediates were previously interpreted wrongly as products of degradation of labile and reactive species. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>H 2 /</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Ar flow (reductive atmosphere). Individual compounds (NH 4 ) 2 [Ir/Pd/Re/Os/PtCl 6 ], (NH 4 ) 2 [IrBr 6 ], (NH 4 ) 3 [Ir/RhCl 6 ], [Pd/Pt(NH 3 ) 4 ][Os/ReCl 6 ], (NH 4 ) 2 [Os x Pt 1-x Cl 6 ],[RuNO(NH 3 )  4 OH][Cu(C 2 O 4 ) 2 (H 2 O) 1.5 ], [RuNO(NH 3 ) 5 ] 2 [Cu(C 2 O 4 ) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ][Cu(C 2 O 4 ) 2 H 2 O] 2 •2H 2 O, [Ir(NH 3 ) 5 Cl][OsCl 6 ], xH 2 [PtCl 6 ]@graphene, were chosen to support our systematic study of the thermal decomposition of coordination compounds. Compounds were used as single-source precursors for nanoporous refractory alloys active as heterogeneous and electrocatalysts. Thermal decomposition was performed in dynamic gas-flow with constant heating ramp (6 or 12 K/min); powder diffraction data were collected with time-resolution (scans were collected every 2 seconds); simultaneously, evolved gases were analysed using mass-spectrometry. Data obtained will be further supported by complementary techniques such as in-house TG-DSC-EGA curves, SEM/EDX, SEM, as well as IR and Raman in situ and ex situ studies; to characterise chemical nature of key intermediates we are also going to perform in situ quick-EXAFS studies (ROCK / SOLEIL / March 2018 and BM23 / ESRF /April-May 2018). Typical temperature-dependent PXRD patterns for [Pd/Pt(NH 3 ) 4 ][Os/ReCl 6 ] are given in Figure below. Their thermal decomposition in Ar and H 2 /Ar can be associated with a formation of (NH 4 ) 2 [Os/ReCl 6 ] + Pt/Pd. Further heating results in a formation of fcc-structured defect single-phase alloy which decomposes with heating to thermodynamically stable fcc+hcp mixture. Thermal decomposition of (NH 4 ) 2 [Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 Cl 6 ] has been investigated to support our study of Os-Pt alloys under high-pressure high-temperature conditions. (NH 4 ) 2 [Os x Pt 1-x Cl 6 ] salts were used as single-source precursor for electrocatalitically active Os-Pt alloys as well as were applied to probe Os-Pt phase diagram under high-pressure. In Ar flow, (NH 4 ) 2 [Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 Cl 6 ] gives directly fcc-Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 (Figure below). In H 2 flow, (NH 4 ) 2 [Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 Cl 6 ] transforms to β-trans-[Pt(NH 3 ) 2 Cl 2 ] + NH 4 Cl + fcc-Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 (above 200 °C) and later to alpha-trans-[Pt(NH 3 ) 2 Cl 2 ] + fcc-Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 (above 250 °C). Above 300 °C, only fcc-Os 0.40 Pt 0.60 can be detected. Further annealing results in a formation of fcc+hcp mixture. [Ir(NH 3 ) 5 Cl][OsCl 6 ] shows similar behaviour: direct formation of two phase Os 0.50 Ir 0.50 in Ar and formation of (NH 4 ) 2 [OsCl 6 ] + Ir with further crystallisation of single phase fcc-Os 0.50 Ir 0.50 . We also investigated thermal decomposition of (NH 4 ) 2 [Ir/PdCl 6 ], (NH 4 ) 2 [IrBr 6 ], and (NH 4 ) 3 [Ir/RhCl 6 ]. It is surprising that all salts decompose with a formation of crystalline intermediate compounds such as (NH 4 ) 2 [PdCl 4 ] and (NH 4 ) 2 [Ir/RhCl/Br 5 (NH 3 )]. Such findings will support our previous studies where Ir-based compound (now detected as (NH 4 ) 2 [IrCl 5 (NH 3 )]) was proposed as key intermediate in a formation of Os-Ir and Re-Ir nanoporous metastable alloys.</figDesc></figure>
