Drops of this suspension were deposited 011 collodion coated electron microscope with a large central cavity in order to prevent from I undesirable scattering. The grids were photographed with optical microscopy and mounted on the microfocus beam line IDl3. 11 4 pm X-ray beam (h = 0.92 A) was produced by a tapered glass capillary. Background scattering was cut with a 10pm aperture positioned between the capillary exit and the sample. Individual granules were second for 16 second using an image intensified CCD camera Photomicrographs taken after the experiments showed clearly the areas that had been irradiated by the X-ray probe (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES -L'ising images intensified from the CCD readout, we were able to record a large number o,f meaningful diffraction patterns on pea starch.</p><p>Most of them were characteristic of mixtures of A and B crystalline types present in the same 4 pm area within a single granule (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The B type was proved to be more present in the center of the granule with a strong intensity for the specific 100 reflexion at 1.6nm. This reflexion is very sensitive to hydration which shows that our sample preparation technique is convenient even for hydrated substrates. No well oriented diagrams were obtained on contrary to those obtained in the preceding trials (SC282). This could be due to the larger beam used in this experiment. These results are of great interest for understanding of specific properties of C-type starches and their biosynthesis (especially the crystallization step). They ~110~ unambigously that a natural polymorphism may be present inside a single granule. Very preliminary results were also obtained 011 amylose-rich starches from maize which exhibit a pure B type (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>); a poor crystallinity and a weak radial orientation on the edges of granules. Further studies on specific single and double mutant starches should lead to a more complete description of the biosynthesis scheme and therefore to opimization of plants for production of starch with  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -Typica! sample of pea-Mch after scanning with 5 micron steps.
