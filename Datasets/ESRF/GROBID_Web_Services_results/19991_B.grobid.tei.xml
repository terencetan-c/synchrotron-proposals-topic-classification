<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Bulk metallic glasses constitute a new class of materials mostly discovered by the team of the co-proposer Akihisa Inoue of Tohoku University since 1989. They are muticomponent alloys that can be amorphized by ingot casting from the liquid state in thicknesses from several mm to centimeters. They were developped by careful additions of selected elements to well known glass-forming near-eutectic alloys such as ZrCu, FeB, PdNiP or lanthanide-Ni with the aim of depressing the liquidus temperatures T l and increasing the temperature range ∆T = T x -T g between the glass transition at T g and crystallisation at T x . The state of the alloy in this temperature range, referred to as the supercooled liquid, is of technological importance because it undergoes Newtonian viscous flow that allows shaping of the alloy at fairly low temperatures (often between 300 and 500 C). The first metallic glass-forming alloys discovered by Paul Duwez required cooling rates of the order of 10 6 degrees/s to suppress nucleation and growth of crystals and attain the glassy state. The new bulk metallic glasses require cooling rates in the range of 10 to 100 K/s thus allowing time for in-situ diffraction studies of their transformations. However crystal nucleation can occur heterogeneously on the surfaces or homogeneously inside such that conventional diffraction in reflection is inadequate and high energy high intensity beams are needed for diffraction in transmission.</p><p>The present project (following HS-299 and HS-822), which has enabled in-situ examination of phase transformations and glass transition in bulk glass-forming alloys at the ESRF, is part of a broader European and international research effort towards a better (more funamental and more quantitative) understanding of these new materials, understanding that has so far been largely empirical. The opportunities at the ESRF and the fruitfull collaboration with the ID11 team have allowed us to obtain thermodynamic (phase diagram information) and structural results of funamental importance (quasi-crystal nucleation) as well as of significance for optimisation of preparation processes and mechanical and magnetic properties of bulk metallic glasses. The participation of the ESRF team being collaborative through EU fellowships (as compared to supportive only), the results have lead to a large number of joint publications. Due to this report's space limitations, the next page gives examples of the most recent results only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ground-breaking results: The first study of the glass transition in metallic glasses by diffraction</head><p>The exact nature of the glass transition in metallic glasses is still under debate mainly because it can only be studied by calorimetric techniques which show an endothermic event corresponding to a specific heat ∆C p difference between the glassy and supercooled liquid states. This can be referred to as the "isentropic T g " occuring to avoid the Kauzmann paradox (see Physics of Amorphous Materials, S.R. Elliott). The specific heat change ∆C p is expected to be accompanied by changes in the compressibility ∆κ T and the thermal expansion coefficient ∆α T ., the three properties being related through the constant R of Prigogine and Defay in R = ∆κ T* ∆C p /{TV * ∆α T 2 }. During heating of a glass below Tg, there is no atomic mobility for structural change and an isostructural thermal expansion coefficient α T is easily obtained by diffraction data hence an "isochoric T g " which may or may not be at the same temperature should be detectable by diffraction. The problem was that near T g , metallic glasses are unstable and crystallise during the diffraction experiment. This limitation does not occur in bulk metallic glasses with large supercooled regions ∆T = T x -T g . The ID11 facilities combined with the quality of our innoculent free, bulk glasses has allowed this collaborative project to become the first capable of comparing "isentropic T g " with "isochoric T g ". The next figures show isentropic T g (measured by DSC) and isochoric Tg (from diffraction data) for two of several bulk metallic glasses recently studied. Several papers are in preparation for presentation and discussion of recent finding. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>T g determined from diffraction data</figDesc></figure>
