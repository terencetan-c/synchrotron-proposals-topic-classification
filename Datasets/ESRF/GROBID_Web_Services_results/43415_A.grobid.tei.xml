<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the experiment and scientific background</head><p>Deubiquitinating enzymes or DUBS are essential for regulating critical ubiquitin pathways <ref type="bibr">(Nijman et al, 2005)</ref>. Usp7/HAUSP is a ubiquitin specific protease that regulates P53 levels in the cell, by cleaving ubiquitin off P53 and Mdm2. It is important for decision making between proliferation, apoptosis and senescence. For these reasons it is pursued a drug target for cancer therapy.</p><p>The C-terminal domain of Usp7 is critical for its full catalytic activity. We have expressed this domain from the human Usp7/HAUSP and crystallized it. Our recent, yet unpublished X-ray structure revealed a modular arrangement. We would like to confirm their relative arrangement in solution using SAXS in order to understand if this arrangement is due to crystal contacts or present in solution. In addition we would like to understand how this domain activates the catalytic domain.</p><p>Crystal structures of the Usp7 catalytic domain are available <ref type="bibr">(Hu et al, 2002)</ref> and we would like to study the complex of the catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain in solution in order to understand it activating effect.</p><p>Drosophila GMP synthase can active Usp7 against P53 and histone H2b (van der <ref type="bibr">Knaap et al, 2005)</ref>. The groups of Peter Verrijzer and ourselves have confirmed this interaction for the human GMP synthase and shown that it maps to the C-terminal domain. A crystal structure for human GMP synthase is available in the PDB. We have expressed human GMP synthase in insect cells and we would like to study the complex between the Usp7 C-terminal domain. and GMPS using SAXS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>Usp7/HAUSP C-terminal domain is expressed easily and can be purified very well. It is a single peak on a gelfiltration column with a monomer size. Constructs expressing the catalytic domain are also well behaved and amenable to SAXS experiments and this is also true for the insect cell expressed GMP synthase. In addition we measured samples of the Catalytic+C-terminal domain of Usp7 and truncations thereof.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained</head><p>We measured 15 samples from 5 constructs. Our measurements showed well behaved protein, with some aggregation and inter-particle effects at the highest concentrations. For the construct for which a crystal structure is available, the C-terminal domain, we performed fitting to zero. By comparing the SAXS curve with the theoretical scattering curve from our crystal structure, we could confirm the structure is different in solution (Fig 1 ) The curves did not fit and the differences exceeded Chi-values of 20. The crystal structure already suggested flexible hinges, and might therefore not be in one conformation. Sofar attempts to determine the SAXS structure using ab initio and rigid body modeling were not succesful, as the modeling did not converge to a single conformation. For some of the other constructs we did not have sufficient data to obtain the optimal experimental curve. Meanwhile we have also made additional constructs that we would like to test, in order to analyze the activating properties of this domain and the relative orientation with respect to the catalytic domain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1: SAXS data of Usp7/HAUSP C-terminal domain was measured at three different concencentrations (1, 2 and 5 mg/ml), and thereafter scaled and extrapolated to zero concentration to correct for interparticle effects. When comparing to the theoretical scattering curve from our crystal structure, we observed large differences between SAXS data and crystal structure.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,34.02,288.60,300.78,220.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
