<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have been synthesizing bioinspired metal organic frameworks (BioMOFs), using active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and non-toxic metals for application into biological and medicinal chemistry. Recrystallization in order to obtain single crystals suitable for structure determination using lab standard diffractometers, has been an impossible task and we were/are strongly relying in powder diffraction to proceed with the structural characterization. This was the reason for requesting time at the ESRF ID31 beam line in 2013. A total of 14 samples were analyzed during our stay, from 5-10 September 2013 at ESRF by M. Teresa Duarte, Vânia André and Sílvia Quaresma at ID31, having Dr. Christina Drathen as a contact person at ESRF. Collected data is under analysis and progress has been done, but it is still an on-going work. Partial results have already been presented in two oral presentations ( [1] Vânia André, XRDa fundamental tool in the world of pharmaceutical crystal forms, Methods of Structure Elucidation -2013, Instituto</p></div>

We believe that the data obtained will result in at least one publication.</p><p>The results obtained form high-resolution data collected at the ESRF ID31 beam line, revealed to be most promising and this is indeed the best/only way for accurate structural elucidation of our compounds, we intend to apply for a continuation proposal of this project at the new beam line ID22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background</head><p>The project that led us to ESRF applies the underlying concepts of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) in biological and medicinal chemistry for the synthesis of BioMOFs, "bioinspired" MOFs, using active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and mainly safe metals, such as Fe, Mg, Zn, Mn and Bi, for potential use in the transport and release of APIs. One approach that is undoubtedly promising is to use the API as the organic fragmentlinker, turning BioMOFs into one of the best possible nanocarriers. Early steps are being taken using nalidixic acid (system A), dapsone (system B), norfloxacin (system C) and pipemidic acid (system D) as linkers. Details on the function, preparation and characterization of these samples can be found in APPENDIX 1 at the end of this report. The products are obtained via conventional solvothermal synthesis or by mechanosynthesis and thus are mainly microcrystalline powders from which structural solution using conventional powder X-ray diffraction proved to be unsuccessful. Data collected at ESRF was of upmost importance for our work.</p></div>

Data was collected from -5 to 30° for most samples and -5 to 45° for the samples that revealed to be most promising for structural solution; longer data acquisition was carried out for higher angles.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>As stated before, the results obtained form high-resolution data collected at the ESRF ID31 beam line revealed to be most promising and this is indeed the best/only way for accurate structural elucidation of our compounds, prompting us to apply for a continuation proposal of this project at the new beam line ID22.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>structural characterization on the novel compounds: (a) index powder pattern and determine lattice; (b) check data bases for related structures; (c) determine space group;(d) gather as much supporting information as possible (chemical composition, density, solid state NMR), (e) extract integrated intensities / structure factors; (f) and ultimately solve structure and refine the model. For some of the samples we unfortunately concluded that this was not possible either due to their sensitivity to radiation damage or to their very low crystallinity. Unfortunately, also a few samples revealed to be a mixture of phases what has been delaying the process and structure solution is most likely unviable for these cases. With five samples we have succeeded in the early steps and we hope to be able to go further in the structural characterization.From all the samples the DAPNi is the most promising for a full structure characterization, due the quality of the diffraction pattern. With this experiment we are expecting to fully elucidate the fine structural details of the DAPNi systems to explain its behaviour under physiological environment.</figDesc></figure>
