<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The complied results from these experiments have been published in Environmental Science and Technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Thalmann, Voegelin, Sinnet, Morgenroth, and Kaegi, 2014)</ref>. A brief summary of the paper is provided below.</p><p>Recent studies have documented that the sulfidation of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP), possibly released to the environment from consumer products, occurs in anoxic zones of urban wastewater systems and that sulfidized Ag-NP exhibit dramatically reduced toxic effects. However, whether Ag-NP sulfidation also occurs under oxic conditions in the absence of bisulfide has not been addressed, yet.</p><p>We, therefore, investigated whether metal sulfides that are more resistant towards oxidation than free sulfide, could enable the sulfidation of Ag-NP under oxic conditions. We reacted citrate-stabilized Ag-NP of different sizes (10 -100 nm) with freshly precipitated and crystalline CuS and ZnS in oxygenated aqueous suspensions at pH 7.5. The extent of Ag-NP sulfidation was derived from the increase in dissolved Cu 2+ or Zn 2+ over time and linked with results from X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of selected samples. The morphological changes of individual Ag-NP occurring during the sulfidation reaction was evaluated based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The respective XAS analyses were proposed within the current experiment 01-01-906.</p><p>The degree of sulfidation derived from the dissolved Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ concentrations by UV-vis measurements were in good agreement with the results from LCF analyses of XAS spectra (Tabel 1). The results of the LCF analyses of the experimental spectra using Ag(0), Ag 2 S and Ag-CuS (used as a proxy for Ag adsorbed to metals sulfides and/or poorly crystalline Ag 2 S) as reference materials are given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In addition, the metallic fractions derived from XANES and EXAFS spectra were also in good agreement.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Metallic Ag fractions derived from UV-Vis measurements and from speciation analysis resulting from LCF of EXAFS spectra using Ag 0 , Ag-CuS, and Ag 2 S as reference spectra. MS refers to metal sulfides and size to the diameter of the Ag-NP.</p><p>The sulfidation of Ag-NP followed pseudo first-order kinetics, with rate coefficients increasing with decreasing Ag-NP diameter and increasing metal sulfide concentration and depending on the type (CuS and ZnS) and crystallinity of the reacting metal sulfide.</p><p>Results from analytical electron microscopy revealed the formation of complex sulfidation patterns that seemed to follow preexisting subgrain boundaries in the pristine Ag-NP (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The kinetics of Ag-NP sulfidation observed in this study in combination with reported ZnS and CuS concentrations and predicted Ag-NP concentrations in wastewater and urban surface waters indicate that even under oxic conditions and in the absence of free sulfide, Ag-NP can be transformed into Ag 2 S within a few hours to days by reaction with metal sulfides.</p></div>		</body>
