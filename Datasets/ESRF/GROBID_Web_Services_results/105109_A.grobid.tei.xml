<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>We obtained SOI samples, diced into 25 mm x 25 mm squares from a 300 mm diameter (001) wafer, with a nominal reported SOI thickness of 12 nm from the Global Foundries (GF) branch of OnSemi Corp. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This thickness was tentative; an oxidation designed to thin the film ended up removing more film thickness than anticipated, and the remaining film thickness could not be characterized by GF. Our in-house reflectivity measurements at Columbia and Grenoble (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) were not sensitive enough to detect the SOI, but showed the presence of the buried oxide layer, with a thickness of approximately 35∓0.5 nm. We initially thought that this was the Si layer, and tried to decrease the thickness by using an isotropic Hydrofluoric-Nitric-Acetic acid (HNA) etch. This etch has very high Si removal rates, around 1 -3 µm per minute (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). However, its SiO ! removal rate is very slow (~10 Å per minute). After several etching studies, followed by in-house reflectivity measurements at the IM2NP (Aix-Marseille University), we noted that the reflectivity signal stabilized after one minute of etch, indicating that the (unresolved) SOI signal was completely removed in one minute or less. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Plot of etch rates versus temperature for the 2:7:1 (HF:HNO3:CH3COOH) solution <ref type="bibr">(fromHamzah, et.al., J. Micromech. Microeng. 22 (2012)</ref> 095017)</p><p>Consequently, we chilled the HNA etching solution using an ice-water bath, and prepared several samples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The SOI thickness of these samples were determined by X-ray reflectivity experiments at the beamline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).   This figure shows that the as-received SOI film was very thin (around 15 Å), and low-temperature etching successfully decreased this film thickness while somewhat increasing the surface roughness as observed from the increasing diffuse scattering, broadening and increasing asymmetry of the in-plane reflections from the SOI (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffraction Measurements ESRF-BM32</head><p>To verify the presence of the SOI layer we conducted in-plane scans of the 220 reflection in the grazingincidence geometry. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>-a shows these in-plane peaks from both the SOI layer and the substrate. The relative intensities of these peaks could be adjusted (6-b), as expected, by adjusting the grazing-incidence angle; shallower incidence close to the critical angle could completely eliminate the substrate peak. Careful radial scans of the SOI and substrate peaks were used to obtain the in-plane Si lattice parameters for these layers.</p><p>While we could locate the out-of-plane 004 peak of the substrate easily, we could not locate the peak for the film despite one day of reciprocal space mapping of the as-received substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>); thus we could not fulfill the primary goal of our experiment, a careful measurement of the peak shape and position of the out-of plane SOI reflections as a function of thickness. This might be due to the very strong signal from the substrate washing out the signal from the SOI. The horizontal diffraction geometry we used to scan for the out-of-plane reflections might have also contributed to the problem due to the large beam divergence associated with this geometry. Unfortunately, we did not have time to do extensive reciprocal space mapping since we ran out of beam-time; it took far longer to align the sample than we anticipated, and we were able to start acquiring real data only on the final night. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Out-of plane reciprocal space mesh of the "Center" sample. While the 004 substrate peak is clearly visible, we were not able to locate the SOI peak.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Work</head><p>Our results show that we need a set of SOI samples on a substrate other than Si or, if this is not possible, to obtain samples with large mis-cut angles, preferably greater than 0.75°. Our current results illustrate some issues which need to be resolved: 1-The large difference between in-plane substrate and film lattice parameters, corresponding to ~0.35% strain. 2-The large difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters of the Si substrate. 3-Spurious intensity peaks which have very strong dependence on theta but no dependence on 2-theta. We hypothesize that they might originate from the fluorescence of particles (Fe?) located on the sample edges and possibly related to the dicing process. Most importantly we need to check and verify the dependence of critical diffraction parameters on film thickness in the nanometer range. Our theoretical analysis shows that peak shape (peak asymmetry, FWHM), peak intensity (integrated and maximum) and peak position depend very strongly on the number of atomic layers participating in diffraction at this level, and the influence of such changes on the structural parameters determined from analysis of experimental data from nano-sized samples should be quantified.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SOI sample mounted on the diffractometer.
