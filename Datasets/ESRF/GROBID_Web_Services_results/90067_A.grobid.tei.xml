<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this experiment was to elucidate the interactions of ions of an ionic liquid (IL) with metal single crystal electrodes by surface X-ray diffraction and measure any potential dependent structural changes observed at the surface. The experiment involved using a new setup which was previously successfully tested and validated during experiment CH-5134 at the ESRF, 2017. Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces were investigated in neat purified [BMPyr]  [TFSI] IL, along with a protonated system containing 0.1M HTFSI/[BMPyr] [TFSI]. During the later stages of the experiment the effects of CO was measured by saturating the experimental chamber with purified CO gas. By using CO as a test molecule it was possible to probe the influence of the electrolyte ordering on surface restructuring and electrochemical reactivity of the systems. The electrode | IL interface has been shown to form structured multilayers in certain ILs 1 and displaying potential dependent structural behaviour 2 . X-ray reflectivity measurements have shown varying IL to demonstrate different surface layering dependent on cation size 3 . In this experiment crystal truncation rod (CTR) profiles alongside X-ray voltammogram were performed, a full data set of the (1 0 L), (0 1 L) and the (1 1 L) rods were recorded between in an extended potential range to our previous experiment between -2400 -1500 mV in 200 mV increments vs a Ag wire reference electrode. XRV measurements were recorded at the (1 0 4.7) and the (1 0 0.5) and (1 0 3.5) positions in reciprocal space to measure any relaxations or structural changes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Contrary to other studies there is no evidence of a reconstructed surface in either the Au or Pt surfaces in the typical potential regime for aqueous systems, or even those reported in STM for IL <ref type="bibr">4</ref> . CTR profiles for the Au(111) system are in line with that of a smoothly terminated gold surface at potentials close the OCP and PZC.</p><p>Potentially dependant behaviour can be observed however with relaxtion or absorption processes being visible from a change in the intensity at the anti-Bragg position. Upon driving the potential more negative a loss in intensity. This process is reversible as the intensity recovers again at positive potentials. XRV measurements have shown no alteration of the intensity in the negative regime with only a reversible relaxation seen in the positive regime. This process coincides with voltametric features. The Au protonated sytem shows similar behaviour to the clean gold with a larger roughening at potentials negative of -1000 mV. The Pt acid system shows interesting electrochemical behaviour with a double nucleation loop being visible in the negative regime at potentials indicative of surface restructuring/reordering (-100 mV) just negative of the PZC. This indicates there could be a process blocking the surface, which could be due to the cataltic absorption H+ from solution at negative potentials. Preliminary data anlysis shows again the presence of relaxation processes. Data anlysis for Pt/CO system is underway.</p><p>References: 1. Fedorov, M. V. &amp; Kornyshev, A. A.
