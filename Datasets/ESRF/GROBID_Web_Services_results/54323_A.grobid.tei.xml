<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BM3001931 1. Crystal structures of SMV norovirus P domain</head><p>We collected a new crystal structure of SMV norovirus P domain. The protein crystal was collected from the screening plate. Data was collected at 1.8 Å resolution with a completeness over 97%. We solved the structure with Molecular replacement and found a dimer and one monomer in the unit cell. This was the first time we could achieve such high resolution. We will try to solve the structure of the P domain in complex with HBGAs in the next visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Crystal structures of HV norovirus P domain</head><p>We collected a new crystal structure of HV norovirus P domain. We were unable to produce any crystals before with this protein and the protein crystal was collected from the screening plate. Data was collected at 1.99 Å resolution with a completeness over 98%. We will also try to solve the structure of the P domain in complex with HBGAs in the next visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Crystal structures of NV93 norovirus P domain</head><p>We collected a new crystal structure of NV93 norovirus P domain. Data was collected at 1.984 Å resolution with a completeness over 99%. The protein crystal was collected from the screening plate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">026 P domain 1152 norovirus P domain</head><p>We collected a new crystal structure of 1152 norovirus P domain. Data was collected at 3.2 Å resolution with a completeness over 86%. The protein crystal was collected from the screening plate.</p></div>
