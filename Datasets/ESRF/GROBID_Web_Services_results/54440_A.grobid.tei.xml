<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 ALBA Synchrotron Carrer de la <ref type="bibr">Llum,</ref><ref type="bibr">08290 Cerdanyola del Vallès,</ref><ref type="bibr">Barcelona (Spain)</ref> Report:</p><p>Scientific background: Radiation damage has become a serious problem in third-generation synchrotron light sources, especially for biological SAXS <ref type="bibr">(BioSAXS)</ref>, where macromolecules are analysed in solution and usually at room temperature. In these conditions, hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals, and superoxide anions, are produced due to the radiolysis of water present in the buffer solution. These radicals lead to the modification of amino acid side chains, which could result in protein aggregation, unfolding, and/or fragmentation of the polypeptide chain. Typical additives used in SAXS against radiation damage are reducing agents like dithiothreitol (DTT), which are not advisable in proteins with disulphide bridges, or cryoprotectants like glycerol, at the cost of worsening the signal-to-noise ratio. Interestingly, synergistic action of hydroxyl radical scavenging compounds like uridine, and superoxide anion scavenging compounds, like manganese and orthophosphate, have been described to show radioprotective properties on enzyme function up to 17.5 kGy exposure <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. These compounds are found in high concentrations in Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremely radioresistant bacteria that can withstand up to 12,000 Gy [1]. Nevertheless, these mixtures have not been investigated as potential scavengers for SAXS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal Summary:</head><p>The aim of this proposal was to characterize the radiation damage on proteins in solution using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments. The efficacy of common additives used to limit radiation damage in SAXS, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and glycerol was compared to uridine, which has shown radioprotective properties [1], but has not been tested as a potential additive to decrease radiation damage on proteins in SAXS. Radiation damage is an issue not completely solved at third-generation synchrotrons, and it is a limiting factor specially for proteins in solution. For this purpose, a wellcharacterized model protein, lysozyme, and human aldose reductase (ALDR1), were analysed in presence and absence of different additives used to decrease radiation damage.</p><p>Experimental methods: The efficacy of uridine as a scavenger for SAXS experiments was compared to DTT. SAXS data were collected at BM29 Beamline using a DECTRIS PILATUS 1M photon counting detector. The SAXS intensity data [I(q) versus q, where q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle] were acquired at 12.5 keV. Measurements were carried out at 25ºC by using the sample changer robot in the static mode, in order to speed-up radiation damage. SAXS data were collected for lysozyme at 1 and 2.5 mg/ml, in the presence of increasing concentrations of DTT and uridine (1, 5 and 10 mM), at pH 5 (50 mM diammonium citrate, pH 5.0) and pH 7.5 (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). Unfortunately, aldose reductase (ALDR1) precipitated after thawing, and it was impossible to collect data from this sample as the protein was aggregated. In addition, samples of lysozyme containing glycerol and control samples without additive were loaded by the robot but not exposed to the beam, due to an under-estimation of the time needed to collect all the images. This underestimation led to a mistake in the programming of the automated collection mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The efficacy of uridine as a scavenger for SAXS experiments was compared to DTT, a common additive used to limit radiation damage. As radius of gyration (Rg) increases proportionally to radiationinduced protein aggregation [2], the dependence of Rg on the accumulated dose was determined for lysozyme in the presence of the different additives. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a representative result of the experiment, corresponding to the increase of the Rg of lysozyme at 1 mg/ml (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>, top) and 2.5 mg/ml (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>, bottom) at different absorbed doses, in presence of increasing concentrations of DTT (left panels) and uridine (right panels).</p><p>Conclusions and future work: Although a slight initial aggregation (prior to irradiation) is present in all the samples, the results show that uridine between 5 and 10 mM decreases radiation damage with a similar efficiency as DTT, which could maintain the Rg of lysozyme 2.5 mg/ml until 1.57 kGy even at 1 mM concentration. Samples containing 2.5 mg/ml lysozyme show in general less radiation-induced aggregation than 1 mg/ml samples, as it is known that protein concentration also influences radiation damage <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. We consider that the results obtained suggest that uridine could be a possible scavenger for SAXS experiments, although it would be necessary to study the increase of Rg in presence of the different additives until higher absorbed doses, and most probably higher uridine concentrations should also be tested.  </p></div>
