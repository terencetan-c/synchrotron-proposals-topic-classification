<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We applied the method of nuclear resonant scattering to investigate the depth profile of magnetic properties in exchange bias bilayers of FeF 2 /Fe as well as MnF 2 /Fe. The results point to significant changes of the interfacial spin structure upon cooling through the Néel temperature of the antiferromagnet (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This was the first study where the spin structure in a ferromagnetic layer in contat to an antiferromagnetic film was investigated at different depths on the same sample. Such an approach is not feasible with CEMS because of the lower countrate. The high sensitivity of the method combined with its high spatial resolution allowed us to measure on samples with an Fe 57 wedge, which covers different depths in the FM layer (cf Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). 60 Å Fe-56 10 Å Fe-56 10 Å Fe-57 40 Å Cu However, at the present stage the results are not conclusive. Due to a lack of beam time, the required number of systematic measurements for different directions of the incident beam and different applied magnetic fields could not be performed and several of the prepared samples could not be measured at all. The reason for this is that the experiment was scheduled at beamline ID22N instead of ID18 as originally proposed. Therefore the x-ray flux at the sample position was a factor of 5 -10 less than expected. Particularly, measurements of the spinstructure at different points of the magnetic hysteresis loop are required for a more conclusive understanding of the influence of the spin structure in the ferromagnetic layer on the exchange bias effect of the whole system. To complete the promising and unique investigations we will apply for a continuation beam time. For these experiments at ID18 we estimate a count rate of 10 -20 Hz from samples with probelayer at the interface. This leads to a data acquisition time of 30 -60 min per spectrum and thus should allow for a conclusive set of data within a beam time of 15 shifts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig.1Sketchof the wedge sample MXJF17A.
