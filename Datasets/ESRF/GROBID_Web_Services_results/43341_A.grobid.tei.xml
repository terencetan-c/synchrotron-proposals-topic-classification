Grenoble, France Mr. CHIVALL James*, U.C.L., London, UK Dr. WARD Roger C. C., University of Oxford, Oxford, UK Dr. ZOCHOWSKI Stanley W., U.C.L., London, UK</p><p>The light actinides exhibit some of the most intriguing properties of all the elements. Bulk alphauranium is rare in being a single-element system exhibiting a charge-density wave (CDW) groundstate. The rearrangement of charge at low temperature is accompanied by a periodic lattice displacement, and observed by the appearance of satellite-peaks in the diffraction patterns obtained from neutron or X-ray scattering.</p><p>The first part of this experiment was given to completing the picture of the effect of thickness on the intensities of the CDW satellites in samples of U grown on Nb substrates. The results of these investigations, including data from samples studied during the present experiment, are included in the experimental report form for experiment 28-01862.</p><p>The direction of the greatest component of the strain due to the CDW displacement is in the [100] direction. For thin-films of uranium grown on W (U:W), the [100] direction lies in the plane of the film-surface, and is therefore constrained in its movement by the rigid substrate. It is supposed that this constraint will suppress the CDW transition. For thin-film samples there is as yet no method available for the verification of the presence of a CDW other than X-ray diffraction of synchrotron radiation. The next part of this experiment was primarily devoted to searching for charge-density wave satellites in these samples. Surprisingly, after a comprehensive survey of the reciprocal lattice positions that the satellite-peaks are seen at in previous samples, no satellite-peaks were seen.</p><p>In samples displaying the CDW transition, a minimum is seen in the a and b lattice parameters near to the transition temperature. In both U:W samples studied, a minimum was seen in the d 206 latticespacing [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>], which suggests that the CDW is present in these samples, but with a different CDW wavevector. Further experiments are planned to exploit the CCD area detector at XMaS to search for CDW satellites at further positions of reciprocal space. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The temperature dependence of the d 206 latticespacing in U:W samples of (left) 500 Å and (right) 50 Å.
