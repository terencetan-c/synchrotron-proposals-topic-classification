<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Investigation of the local environment of cobalt in cobaltcontaining mesoporous catalysts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The experimental work done at the ESRF which this report is based on, is part of a larger project entitled "Interfacial chemistry of cobalt (II) during sol-gel synthesis of cobalt-containing mesoporous materials". A manuscript including all the results from this project is now under preparation. Cobaltcontaining mesoporous materials have potential applications within heterogeneous catalysis, and the objective of this project was to understand the chemistry during the synthesis of these materials. Cobalt was incorporated into two types of mesoporous materials; MCM-41 and MCM-48.</p><p>At the ESRF, several samples were investigated by EXAFS spectroscopy. The purpose of this work was to investigate the local environment of cobalt in the samples before and after calcination, i.e. to verify that the cobalt was actually incorporated into the silica mesoporous framework during synthesis, and to observe any changes during calcination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The results from the EXAFS curve fitting for some of the samples are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, and the EXAFS curves and Fourier Transforms for as-synthesised and calcined Co-MCM-41 are shown in Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>, respectively. These figures are representative for all the samples investigated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The EXAFS investigations performed at the ESRF verified that the cobalt was successfully incorporated into the silica mesoporous framework in all the samples.

No cobalt shells were detected for any of the samples, which indicate that no cobalt oxide or metallic cobalt is present in the samples. Some changes in local environment occured during calcination, but the cobalt remained incorporated into the silica framework.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Co-MCM-48</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Sample</cell><cell>Shell</cell><cell>N</cell><cell>R (Å)</cell><cell>2σ 2 (Å 2 )</cell></row><row><cell>41 as-synth</cell><cell>Co -O</cell><cell>4.9</cell><cell>2.073 (3)</cell><cell>0.0096 (9)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Co ••• Si</cell><cell>6.9</cell><cell>3.297 (3)</cell><cell>0.0091 (9)</cell></row><row><cell>41 calcined</cell><cell>Co -O</cell><cell>4.0</cell><cell>2.055 (4)</cell><cell>0.013 (1)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Co ••• Si</cell><cell>6.3</cell><cell>3.275 (4)</cell><cell>0.014 (1)</cell></row><row><cell>48 as-synth</cell><cell>Co -O</cell><cell>5.5</cell><cell>2.056 (5)</cell><cell>0.016 (2)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Co ••• Si</cell><cell>8.0</cell><cell>3.300 (4)</cell><cell>0.010 (4)</cell></row><row><cell>48 calcined</cell><cell>Co -O</cell><cell>4.3</cell><cell>2.026 (3)</cell><cell>0.015 (1)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Co ••• Si</cell><cell>4.1</cell><cell>3.254 (4)</cell><cell>0.0108 (9)</cell></row></table></figure>
