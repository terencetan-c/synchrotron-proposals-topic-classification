As the toxicity of Ag strongly depends on its speciation, the physical-chemical transformation during the transport of the AgNP in the sewer and during the wastewater treatment needs to be evaluated in detail <ref type="bibr">(Kaegi et al. 2012)</ref>. Applied studies performed on full-and pilot-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) <ref type="bibr">(Kim et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, Kaegi et al. 2011)</ref> as well as fundamental investigation on the lab scale <ref type="bibr">(Levard et al. 2011)</ref> suggest that Ag-NP are readily transformed into Ag 2 S for example during anaerobic stages of the wastewater treatment. A surface coating, e.g. an organic coating, does not protect Ag-NP from corrosion (transformation into Ag 2 S or AgCl) but could influence the kinetics of the transformation reactions. In our previous report (01-01-813) we have shown the feasibility to determine the speciation of Ag present in low concentrations (ppm) and in complex environmental matrices, such as sewage sludge. However, rather fast transformation kinetics could lead to artifacts regarding the speciation of Ag caused by the sample preparation. Therefore, we used different sample preparation techniques to assess the effect of the sample treatment on the speciation of the Ag-NP. In parallel we also performed electron microscopic analysis (scanning-and transmission electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive xray analysis) to further contain our findings.</p><p>Experiments were performed with Ag-NP (10 and 100nm diameter) stabilized with citrate either under non-aerated (sealed reaction vessels with no headspace) or aerated (constant bubbling of air in open reaction vessels) conditions. The reaction time was 20 minutes. The concentration of Ag in the spiked sewage sludge was only about 500 µg/l (ppb), and therefore Ag had to be concentrated in the samples to be analyzed at the synchrotron using XANES. Based on our previous studies we knew that the AgNP were dominantly attached to the sewage flocs and therefore, the AgNP were concentrated by centrifugation (10min at 3000 x g). The sediment was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were freeze dried and pressed into 13mm pellets in a glove box under anoxic conditions. Alternatively, selected samples were kept frozen and analyzed in the frozen state. An additional experiment was conducted by spiking AgNP into frozen sludge followed by a short period of mixing in a ball mill using liquid nitrogen cooled buckets, followed by freeze drying. Samples for electron microscopy were prepared by either filtering 1mL of sludge using 0.05µm membrane filters or by putting a drop of sludge (100 µl) on a lacy TEM grid. To be comparable with the synchrotron preparation techniques, additional frozen samples were embedded in epon resin in the frozen state and 200nm thick TEM sections were cut with a diamond knife. The Ag K-edge XANES spectra of these samples were recorded at 80K using a He-cooled cryostat in fluorescence mode at the DUBBLE beamline. For the interpretation of experimental spectra by linear combination fitting, a series of reference materials were analyzed (in transmission mode), amongst others metallic Ag, Ag-NP, AgCl, Ag 2 S, Ag 2 O, thiol-bound Ag+, Ag-lactate, and aqueous Ag+. LCF fits revealed Ag 2 S and metallic Ag as the most relevant spectra. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> these two spectra together with selected experimental spectra are given. Results from the LCF are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.  <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Experimental XANES spectra of references (Ag 2 S, and Ag(0) and the experimental spectra A visual comparison immediately reveals the similarity of the samples that were kept frozen and the samples that were freeze dried and pressed into pellets. The AgNP from the frozen samples remained dominantly metallic but the freeze dried samples always consisted of a significant proportion of Ag 2 S. Even Ag-NP that where we spiked into the frozen sludge turned out be sulfidic after freeze-drying / pelleting the sample. Also the AgNP which were reacted with the activated sludge under aerated conditions (constant aeration of the sludge during the experiment) transformed into sulfidic species. These surprising results suggested that the freeze drying process severely affected the speciation of the AgNP.</p><p>To constrain these findings we carried out TEM analysis of a sample reacted under aerated conditions and embedded in epon resin in the frozen state without freeze drying. High resolution TEM images (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) and EDX analysis of individual Ag-NP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) confirm that the particles remained metallic and did not sulfidice, in contrast to the XANES spectra that suggested near complete sulfidation after freeze drying.</p><p>These results suggest that the preparation technique, e.g. the freeze-drying process, can lead to severe artifacts in the speciation of Ag-NP as revealed by Ag K-edge XANES in combination with analytical electron microscopy. Freeze drying is a frequently used sample preparation technique for speciation analysis and therefore we will further investigate the effects of the freeze drying process on the speciation of Ag-NP is more detail. The results will possibly have a significant impact on the interpretation of published literature.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3: EDX spectrum of the Ag-NP shown on the right.Figure 2: High resolution TEM images of a Ag-NP (100nm citrate, aerated)</figDesc><graphic coords="4,41.15,270.60,204.75,204.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
