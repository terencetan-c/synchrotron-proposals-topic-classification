<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific objectives</head><p>In Complex Metallic Alloys (CMA), phases are formed with crystal structures based on giant unit cells containing tens, up to more than a thousand atoms per cells. Up to now, the growth mechanisms of these materials is unclear, in particular the arrangement of the giant unit cells to form the final periodic structure. Then, it would be of great interest to determine the lattice perfection of CMA and the nature of defects in this class of solids. In the frame of the European Network of Excellence entitled Complex Metallic Alloys [<ref type="url" target="www.cma-ecnoe.org">www.cma-ecnoe.org</ref>], we have proposed to characterise in situ and real time the solidification dynamics of these systems in order to understand several critical pending issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments</head><p>Three different samples were prepared for this experimental session. Two samples (provided within the CMA -framework) with the composition Zn 91 Mg 9 , dedicated to the study of the Laves phase growth and one Al -10 wt% Cu sample for performing some feasibility tests with a 3µm optics. The sample dimensions used were similar to previous experiments (for instance MA-514), about 35mm x 6mm x 200μm.</p><p>The samples were mounted in a new type of crucible, which is made of two rigid boron-nitride walls glued together, one with a caved rectangular section. This crucible design was chosen instead of our "traditional" graphite sheets to ensure i) a uniform sample thickness once the sample is molten and ii) a more tight crucible.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>One of the aims within the CMA-network is to study the solidification structure of the Bergman phase (Mg32(Al,Zn)49) and the complex phases of the Zn-Mg system, as the Zn2Mg Laves phase or Zn 11 Mg 2 . The Bergman phase is a 1/1 approximant of the fci-Ho-Mg-Zn quasicristal, and Zn 11 Mg 2 is an 1/0 approximant. The primitive cubic cell of the Zn 11 Mg 2 structure holds 39 atoms (Pearson : CP39) within a volume of 625.5 Å 3 . This is rather small for a CMA (compared to 22526 Å 3 of the β-Mg 2 Al 3 phase [HS-2791]). However as for the β-Mg 2 Al 3 phase we expect a facetted growth of Zn 11 Mg 2. This intermetallic phase is obtained by a peritectic reaction in a concentration window from Zn 91 Mg 9 to Zn 92.2 Mg 7.8 and a temperature range from 381°C to 364°C followed by a eutectic reaction L→ (Zn)+ Zn 11 Mg 2 .</p><p>Due to the high vapour pressures of Mg and Zn, the crucible has to be tight. Although we changed the crucible design and material, we were not able to fulfil this constraint. As we heated the sample, an increase of the pressure in the HUV chamber was measured, showing a large sample out gassing. Moreover, to melt the sample we had to heat tenth of degrees above the expected melting temperature, which indicated a variation of the average Mg-concentration. Despite the higher vapour pressure of Zn, its lost was outdone by the depletion of Mg due to oxidation. After solidification we found the (Zn)-phase and a Manganese oxide shell at the level where the X-rays hit the sample. SEM micrographs of the polished sample are shown in figure below: The first micrograph shows a region of the mother alloy. The dark phase is Zn 11 Mg 2 whereas the light one is Zn. The larger pattern of Zn 11 Mg 2 solidifies first followed by the eutectic reaction. After the experiment at ID19 the sample was grinded to remove the oxide layer. Those regions of the sample that were not exposed to X-rays show the eutectic solidification pattern. The oxidation of the sample in the X-ray window was more pronounced, and the sample becomes thinner. The oxide layer remains at a level where the rest of the sample shows a metallic aspect after grinding as shown in figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). A further polish reveals the (Zn)-phase below the oxide layer, explaining the higher temperatures needed to melt the sample. Further investigations have to be done to test new crucible design in order to prevent both samples out gassing and chemical reaction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>a) Micrograph of sample before experiment; part with Zn 11 Mg 2 -phase and eutectic pattern Zn 11 Mg 2 +(Zn) b) Micrograph of sample; lower part with eutectic pattern Zn 11 Mg 2 +(Zn) c) Micrograph of sample; central part exposed to the beam: crystallised Zn surrounded by oxides.</figDesc></figure>
