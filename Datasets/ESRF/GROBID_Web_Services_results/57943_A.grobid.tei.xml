<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the project was to study the nature, the details, and the peculiarities of magnetic state in the iron chalcogenide (Fe1-xCox)7S8 system by means of core-to-core (ctc) and valence-to-core (vtc) x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at different external conditions (the proposal #p37148).</p><p>As is known, the shape of core-to-core XES (Kα1,2 and Kβ1,3 lines) is directly connected to the magnetic moment of an element studied. Within the limits of experimental error (≤0.1 eV) no temperature-induced changes of ctc-XES lineshape were detected in the range 10-700 K for both cobalt and iron in any compound. In illustration, the Kα1,2 spectra of Fe7S8 at different temperatures are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. This fact points on the completely localized nature of local moments in this family of chalcogenides, and disprove the hypothesis of transition "localized moments → band (Stoner) magnetizm" upon cobalt doping put forward previously.</p><p>The iron and cobalt Kα1,2 spectra of representative compounds obtained at room temperature are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>; in the inserts, the Kα1 FWHMs along with corresponding local moment values µ for all compounds are presented. The numerical values of µFe,Co were extracted by means of usual reference technique (with pure iron, pure cobalt, FeS2 and Co7S8 as reference samples). In this investigation, the formation of magnetic moments on Co atoms in these compounds have been established for the first time. The size of the moments allows one to suggest their "induced" nature. µFe shows gradual reduction with increasing cobalt content. Also, the dependence of µFe on lattice parameter c (the spacing between Fe layers) reveals two distinct branches: at small and intermediate lattice parameters µFe is almost linearly proportional to c, while at highest lattice parameters a kind of "saturation" effect was discovered. Such behavior of µFe resembles strikingly gradual collapse of a magnetic moment in an itinerant system upon applying external pressure.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the vtc-XES (Kβ2,5 spectra) of iron in the (Fe1-xCox)7S8 series are shown. The increasing sharpness of Kβ" low-energy satellite reflects increasing overlapping between iron 3d and sulfur 3s orbitals upon increasing Co content, following by lattice contraction. The growing "hump" on the high-energy side of the spectra might suggest the increasing injection of electrons by Co to the valence band. Ab-initio calculations of the density of states near the Fermi level in these compounds will clarify this issue.</p><p>Finally, the high-pressure experiment on (Fe0.6Co0.4)7S8, surprisingly, have revealed no transition to low-spin state for pressures up to 22 GPa, the highest value achievable in the utilized highpressure cell. This is in drastic contrast to Fe7S8 and FeS cases, in which spin transitions occurs at P≤6.5 GPa. Such an effect can be attributed either to increased porousness of the crystal lattice due to the smaller atomic radii of Co with respect to Fe, or to increase of stiffness of atomic bonds upon Co doping. The future XES and EXAFS experiments at higher pressures could shed light on the exact physical nature of this result.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,304.90,466.30,215.45,345.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
