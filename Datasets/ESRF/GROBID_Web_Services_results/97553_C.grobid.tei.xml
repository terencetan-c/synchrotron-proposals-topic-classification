<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the beamtime ES-1058, (DOI:10.15151/ESRF-ES-502121336), performed between august 25th 2021 and august 28th 2021 at ID15b, ESRF, single crystals of inyoite and jadarite have been compressed, at ambient temperature, up to ⁓17 and ⁓18.5 GPa respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), using helium as pressure-transmitting medium. In the case of jadarite, 1 additionally powder experiment (up to 20 GPa) was performed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Results concerning jadarite are currently been analysed, but they clearly show that jadarite undergoes a first order phase transition, at about 16.5 GPa. The crystalline structure of the high-pressure polymorph of jadarite has been successfully resolved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), a paper has been accepted and published in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society (DOI: 10.1111/jace.18659) Data regarding inyoite also reveal a first order phase transition, occurring at about 8 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) but, above the phase transition, the poor-quality of the data (due to the loss of crystalline order) prevented the resolution of the crystal-structure of the inyoite high-pressure polymorph. Nonetheless, data reveal interesting features that have been addressed and published in Physics and Chemistry of Minerals (DOI: 10.1007/s00269-021-01173-3)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final remarks</head><p>Overall, ID15b produced high-quality data and the results are really promising: ideally, 2 papers will be produced. ID15b is the ideal beamline for this kind of experiment due to the small-size of the beam, its Eiger2 9M detector and its user-friendly set-up. We will submit, in the framework of a broader project, that aims to study the high-pressure and temperature stability of hydrated borates, in order to better understand the presence of common features that could be used to forecast their P-T range of stability, further proposals on other hydrated borates.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: High-pressure evolution of the unit-cell volume of jadarite (left) and inyoite (right).</figDesc><graphic coords="2,308.50,72.00,235.01,174.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
