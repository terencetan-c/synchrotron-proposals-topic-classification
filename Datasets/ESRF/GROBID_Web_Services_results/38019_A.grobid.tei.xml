<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Crystals of the XPD protein have been measured at BM14 and a total amount of 5 datasets have been collected so far. The protein crystals belong to the space group P6 5 with unit cell constants as indicated in table 1. The statistics of the best two data sets (used for substructure determination) are given in the table below. Both data sets are from the native protein with the iron sulfur cluster present as confirmed by an edge scan at the iron edge and have been collected at a wavelength of 1.7Å and 1.0Å, respectively. Other datasets include XPD co-crystallized with an iodized ATP (1.7Å), a quick Platinum (PT)-soak (1.0Å), and another native set at a wavelength of 1.7Å.</p><p>The substructure of the iron sulfur cluster could be solved using Sharp. The substructure was solved using the best two data sets for a 2-wavelength MAD experiment. Combinations with any of the other data sets did not yield any improvement so far. Working on other combinations of datasets employing MIRAS or SIRAS strategies is still in progress and initial processing of the data indicates that the PT-soak could be a promising strategy to get sufficient phase information, combined with the iron sulfur cluster. This is based on a difference Fourier map revealing additional peaks that could represent PT sites. To further pursue this the soaking time and PT derivative needs to be optimised and more crystals have to be tested. However, due to the limited resolution of a maximum of 2.9Å and the size of the protein (620 amino acids) the building of a sensible model has not succeeded yet.</p><p>To improve the diffraction quality of the crystals a new purification and crystallization scheme is currently being employed. The key point is to purify and crystallize the protein under anaerobic conditions. Since in previous purifications heavy precipation was observed after the affinity purification step the protein was purified and crystallized under anaerobic conditions leading to higher yield and much lesser precipitation during purification. Crystallisation experiments are currently running.
