<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The biosynthesis of the cell wall is an attractive target for structure-assisted drug design of novel antibacterial drugs mainly because there are a large number of compounds in the cell wall that are not found in mammalian and other higher organisms. One such compound is galactofuranose (Galf). Galf is a component of the LPS in many gram-negative bacteria, found in the O antigens of ma ny species including Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli Galactofuranosyl residues are also an important component of the arabino-galactan complex that forms part of the mycolitic layer in the cell walls of mycobacteria <ref type="bibr">[Weston, 1998 #6]</ref>. Galf is incorporated into cell walls from UDP-Galf, formed by the enzyme UDPgalactopyranose mutase (mutase) from UDP-galactopyranose (Galp). The chemistry involved in this ring contraction mechanism is completely unprecedented and is the source of great interest. Complexes of UDP-galactopyranose mutase with 4 different inhibitors/substrates were prepared by soaking crystals with 5-10 mM of ligand for 1-2 hrs. No in-house data collection is possible due to the very weak diffraction from the crystals (see previous reports). Crystals were frozen and data collected at 30 sec. Exposures, 0.5 ° oscillation, 180 images. The resulting data are listed in the Table I below. Ligand 4 only gave mosaic crystals to at best 4 Å resolution. The data sets for the other three complexes were solved and refined, however no electron density could be seen for any of the ligands. We have therefore concluded that we require to crystallize the enzyme from a different species to determine co-complexes.</p><p>Table I UDP-galactopyranose mutase + ligands Ligand 1 Ligand 2 Substrate Resolution (Å) 48.8 -2.5 74.5 -2.7 52.7 -2.5 Space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 P2 1 2 1 2 1 P2 1 2 1 2 1 Cell constants (Å; º) 56.33 90.29 131.93 90.0, 90.0, 90.0 56.39 96.84 131.71 90.0, 90.0, 90.0 55.40 95.16 127.92 90.0, 90.0, 90.0 Total measurements 63902 81405 74686 Unique reflections 18743 25616 23509 Average redundancy 3.4 2.8 3.2 I/s 5.4 3.5 4.0 Completeness (%) 98 99.4 97.9 R merge 9.6 13.5 15.5 3-Methylaspartase (E.C. 4.3.1.2) catalyses the reversible anti-elimination of ammonia from L-threo-(2S,3S)-3methylaspartic acid to give mesaconic acid as well as a slower syn-elimination from the (2S,3R)-epimer, Lerythro-3-methylaspartic acid. The anti-elimination reaction occurs in the second step of the catabolic pathway for glutamic acid in Clostridium tetanomorphum. The reverse reaction is of particular interest because the addition of ammonia to substituted fumaric acids is highly stereoselective and gives highly functionalised amino acids. Access to these synthetically useful compounds by conventional synthesis is extremely difficult and not well developed. However, engineering of 3-methylaspartase is greatly hindered by the lack of structural information and the absence of homologues in the Protein Data Bank. The crystal structure will facilitate future efforts to engineer 3-methylaspartase by directed evolution. The structure will help unravel the complex mechanism of this transformation. We have obtained native crystals and collected the data summarised in Table 1. This work has been accepted for publication in Acta Cryst D.
