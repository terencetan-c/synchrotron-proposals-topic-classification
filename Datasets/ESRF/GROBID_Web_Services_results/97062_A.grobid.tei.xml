<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment has allowed us to elucidate the relationship between Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy (PMA) in Co/Pd heterostructures and the structure and composition of the Co/Pd multilayer. We explored the effect of low energy ion bombardment, that can increase interfacial roughness, induce intermixing or even clustering and alloying. We have performed a combination of XRD, XRR, supported by energy-dependent HAXPES and XAS to get a complete structural and compositional map of the multilayers, and we have correlated it with the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.</p><p>We have characterized the compositional and chemical depth-profile of Co/Pd heterostructures grown at the same conditions, before and after being modified by low energy ion bombardment. We have measured 1 pristine sample and 5 ion-bombarded samples, treated with different ion doses at an ion (Ar + ) energy of 3 keV. The samples (formed by 20 Pd/Co bilayers) were fabricated by magnetron sputtering in Madrid at a base pressure better than 10 -7 torr by sequential deposition of Co and Pd.</p><p>We have determined, by XRR, the thickness of each sample and found results matching our expected primarily thicknesses. XRD results show a preferential growth in the (111) out-of-plane direction for the Pd. But they also show a lack of clear structural transformations with increasing ion doses, even though our magnetic measurements showed a trend, were the PMA is clearly reduced with the increasing dose. At the highest dose the PMA completely disappears, and the easy magnetization direction is the in-plane direction, typical of ordinary thin films. So the transition from out-of-plane (PMA) to in-plane easy magnetization is not accompanied by clear structural transformations, at least clearly detected with the techniques available during the beamtime. The disorder induced by ion bombardment at the topmost interfaces is not evidenced by XRD, but clearly unbalances the delicate equilibrium which stabilizes the PMA. HAXPES and XAS measurements show that the metallic Co deposited in the multilayers is in fact not fully metallic, but approximately 50% of it was oxidized, also in the pristine sample. We have not found a trend relating the ion dose to the degree of oxidation of the samples. The nature of the oxide is probably closer to CoO than to any other phase. The existence of a satellite in the HAXPES spectra is a clear hint supporting the presence of octahedral CoO. XAS measurements also support the presence of the monoxide CoO as the most compatible phase.</p><p>XPS spectra show that the presence of the Cobalt oxide is more evident at the surface (where XPS is more sensitive) than in the bulk (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Probably, the most interesting and surprising result of the beamtime has been to get the evidence that Cobalt is oxidized to a high extent. So, the study of the nature of the magnetic interactions present must necessarily include this fact. To check that the presence of the oxide has not been induced by the synchrotron beam, we have checked, after the beamtime, in Madrid, that the pristine sample keeps the PMA untouched and that it is essentially the same as before taking the sample to the ESRF.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows some of the other most relevant preliminary results of the measurements taken <ref type="bibr">(HAXPES, XAS and XRD)</ref>. HAXPES has allowed us to get compositional information from the deepest layers of the heterostructure. This is evident from the Si 1s core level, where we detect both the Si and SiO2 phases (that later coming from the native oxide of the substrate before growing).</p><p>In summary, the beamtime has been fruitful and we have obtained interesting results, which are now being summarized and discussed in a manuscript which will be soon submitted for publication. a b c</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Departamento de Física de Materiales, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas Plaza de las Ciencias 1, ES -28040 MADRID Dr RODRIGUEZ DE LA FUENTE Oscar PARENTE CAMPOS Ana Dr MUNOZ NOVAL Alvaro SEBASTINI Eugenia</figDesc></figure>
