<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a potential bioscavenger of toxic organophosphates. It can be used as an antidote to protect acetylcholinesterase and is a protein of choice for development of detoxification biocatalysts for clinical applications. To date, all the attempts to obtain the atomic structure of the full-length glycosylated tetrameric BChE were unsuccessful. The aim of the project was to use Cryo-EM technique to reveal the structure of the native tetrameric BChE and to clarify the details of its tetrameric and dimeric interfaces. Based on our preliminary experiments we estimated the optimal concentration of the sample for the experiment, prepared the grids and conducted Cryo-EM experiments at the ESRF instrument equipped with K2 detector.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">RELION 2.1  3 According to ResMap 1.1.4</ref> Examples of obtained images are shown on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Noteworthy, that side view on BChE tetramers can also be projection of BChE dimers. Obtained images were processed as described below (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data processing</head><p>Frame alignment and dose weighting were performed using UCSF Motioncor2. CTF estimation on aligned, unweighted, micrographs was performed with Gctf. All data processing steps except for the particle picking procedure were conducted in RELION 2.1. The BChE particles were picked automatically using Gautomatch software (<ref type="url" target="https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/">https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/</ref>) with an automatically generated template. This resulted in 170,963 particles, which were extracted (256×256 pixels) and downsampled (128×128 and 64×64 pixels) for the iterative reference-free 2D classification. In total, 49,261 particles of 2D classes that possessed the quaternary structure features (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) were subjected to 3D classification. A low-resolution initial tetramer model, required for the 3D classification stage, was built in EMAN2 using the corresponding class averages. The 3D classification resulted in five 3D classes, of which only one class had the quaternary structure features characteristic of tetramer. Subsequent 3D refinement of this tetrameric class containing 6712 particles was done without applying symmetry. This subset of particles was used for the final refinement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The refinement was made using a soft mask encompassing the whole map and C2 symmetry based on preliminary knowledge of the tetramer structure and led to an improvement of the resolution. The 7.6 Å resolution of the final map was estimated by the 0.143 FSC criterion after a postprocessing procedure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Estimation of the local resolution was done with ResMap with the soft mask used in postprocessing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). The final 3D map was deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under the accession code EMD-0256. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CryoEM model of BChE tetramer</head><p>The dataset was collected using a K2 detector on a Titan Krios electron microscope. Raw particles showed a moderate distribution of the expected tetramers, and reference-free 2D averages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) clearly demonstrate the presence of the expected oligomeric state. An initial reconstruction without symmetry applied gave a 10.5 Å resolution. C2 symmetry application, together with mask-enforced reconstruction, provided a 9.1 Å resolution, which was finally increased to 7.6 Å after postprocessing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). This confirmed that the tetramer is a dimer of dimers, as previously stated. The final cryoEM map exhibited characteristic features of the BChE tetramer: a four-monomer arrangement with well-resolved secondary structural elements, as well as a left-handed superhelical C-terminal tail which lies in the center of the molecule along the 2-fold axis of the tetramer, perpendicular to its "plane" (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1a :</head><label>1a</label><figDesc>Fig. 1a: Top view on BChE tetramers are highlighted by green circle.
