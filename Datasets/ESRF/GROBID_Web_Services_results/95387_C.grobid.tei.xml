<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to use dark-field X-ray microscopy to observe how the microstructure in a ferroelectric KNbO3 single crystal changes when an alternating voltage is applied in a stroboscopic fashion. To this end mosaicity scans were performed while triangle pulses at 300 Hz were applied. Strain scans were attempted, but drift in the motors positioning the lens made this approach challenging. The experimental setup is sketched and outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. An optical chopper with a 10% duty cycle was syncronized to the AC voltage of a signal generator. The AC voltage output is sent to a x20 amplifier and then applied to the sample. The chopper time delay (phase) is then scanned across the triangle pulses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>In the mosaicity scan the sample was rotated around two axes orthogonal to the Q-vector, ùúî and ùúí, where the axis of rotation for ùúî is also orthogonal to the beam.The KNbO3 sample was poled along a (0,0,1) pseudocubic axis, resulting in four possible domian orientatins, all of which were observed. Only one of the four pseudocubic (1,1,0) reflections were observed in any one mosiaicity scan. The summed intensity is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>. There is little variation in this while the voltage is cycled, suggesting that no non-180¬∞ switching occurs.</p><p>The center of mass (COM) in ùúî and ùúí is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>. The COM varies as the electric field is cycled, both due to the piezoresponse but also due to switching of neighbouring domains. The experiment showed that this response is qualitatively different at 30 and 50 V, and there is significant variation in behaviour accross the sample, but only at 50 V. At 30 V the behaviour is to a large extent homogeneous. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2d</ref> shows how the average COM behaves during the voltage cycle. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref> shows how the COM (center) deviates from the mean COM value of each pixel. There is a qualitatively different behaviour in the red and green parts of the figure. The selected mosaicity scan is from the rising edge in voltage, and the red part of the figure has switched, while the green part has yet to switch. This demonstrates the dynamical and inhomogenous switching dynamics of an otherwise (nearly) defect-free single crystal. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2</figDesc><graphic coords="3,77.35,318.23,446.25,218.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
