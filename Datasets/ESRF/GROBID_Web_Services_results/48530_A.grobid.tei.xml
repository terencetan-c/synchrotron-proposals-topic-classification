<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of this proposal was to determine the molecular-scale mechanisms of As retention and dissolution in flooded soils (up to 4000 mg/kg As) impacted by a heavily contaminated acid mine drainage (AMD) in the Gard department, France. Beyond the natural attenuation processes related to As and Fe biomineralization in this AMD, little is known on the evolution of As-rich iron-oxide colloids deposited on riverbank soils upon large flooding events. Evaluating the mobility and toxicity of arsenic in these soils over which housing and local agriculture has developed is of prime importance for soil and water management. As K-XANES indicated changes in As oxidation state from topsoil to deep horizons and As K-EXAFS analysis of the investigated soil samples was expected to reveal As bearing phases. Unfortunately, severe difficulties were encountered for recording EXAFS data on these impacted but natural soil samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Data were recorded using 220 Si monochromator with saggital focusing of the second crystal. Sample fluorescence was measured using a 30 elts Ge detector. Similar difficulties were encountered in obtaining EXAFS data on river sediments from the same and other localities (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Figure2.ExamplesofEXAFSdatacollectedattheAsK-edgeinfluorescencemodeat10KonfinelygroundnaturalAMDsedimentscontaining 400ppmwt.As(V).Althoughthethreescansarecollectedatthesamespotposition,dataarenotreproducible,whichmightberelatedtothe difficulty of recording EXAFS data on natural heterogeneous samples with grain size of few tens of microns, using a small heterogeneous focusedX-raybeamofafewhundredmicronwidth.</p><p>In order to optimize the beamtime, As K-edge data were recorded on laboratory samples consisting of Assorbed pure iron minerals obtained from abiotic as well as biogenic pathways and containg 0.1 to 3 wt% As. On these homogeneous samples, good quality data could obtained by merging 3 to 10 scans (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). In addition, Fe K-edge data were also recorded on natural sediments and on laboratory samples in transmission mode (40 wt% Fe) and were of very good quality for both types of samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> and 5 , respectively). Data collected on AMD sediments samples are used to comlete an already existing data set and are thus already included in a manuscript in preparation.</p><p>Besides, data at the As and Fe K-edge for the flooded soils samples are still missing and are the goal of the resubmission of this proposal for experiments at the SAMBA beamline. 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 xas.ext exp_k3 fit_k3 exp_k3 fit_k3 unfiltered k 3 χ(k) k (Å -1 ) Fh B Fh A 0 1 2 3 4 5 FT R + ∆r (Å) Fh B Fh A -5 0 5 10 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 qxp_k3 fit_k3 qxp_k3 fit_k3 FT -1 for R = { 0 -2 Å} k (Å -1 ) Fh B Fh A -2 0 2 4 6 4 6 8 10 12 14 qxp_k3 fit_k3 qxp_k3 fit_k3 FT -1 for R = { 2 -4 Å} k (Å -1 ) Fh B Fh A Figure5.ExamplesofhighqualityEXAFSdatacollectedattheFeK-edgeintransmissionmodeat10KonAs-sorbedhydratediron-oxyhydroxide samplespreparedinthelaboratory.Shell-by-shellfittingconfirmlocalstructuresclosetothatofferrihydritewithdistortedFe-Oshellandtwo Fe-Fe distances at 3.0Å and 3.45Å.
