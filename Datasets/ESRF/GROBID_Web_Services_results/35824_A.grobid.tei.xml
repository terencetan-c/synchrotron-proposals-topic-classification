<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Water oxidizing photosynthesis producing dioxygen is a key reaction sustaining life on earth. In the future, light-driven water oxidation may be coupled to H 2 -production by hydrogenases for fuel production. O 2 formation proceds at the manganese complex of photosystem II (PSII) in a complex reaction cycle involving a series of intermediates (S-states). We have established the existence of an intermediate, S 4 , in the crucial O 2 -evolving reaction step S 3 →S 0 +O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The properties of the S 4 state were scrutinized in time-resolved X-ray experiments at the Mn K-edge using laser flash excitation of PSII samples in the Xray beam. The lifetime of the intermediate was extended by varying the sample pH and using the replacement of H 2 O by D 2 O. Most interestingly, the experiments provided evidence for a further intermediate in the Mnoxidizing S 2 →S 3 transition that needs to be further characterized. These observations strongly support our extended reaction cycle of photosynthetic water oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. (2) Preliminary Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) experiments were performed on Ni-Fe hydrogenases and model compounds. RIXS on biological metal centers is feasible at ID26 and will be used in 2008 to study the Mn complex of PSII. Results: Multilayer samples of PSII were prepared in H 2 O at pH 6.3 and in D 2 O at pD values of 5.8 and 6.8. The rationale was to kinetically label those reactions coupled to protolysis in the water oxidation cycle and to extend the lifetime of intermediates. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows X-ray transients in H 2 O and D 2 O on the four transitions between the semistable S-states. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> The ratio of the rates k H /k D of Mn oxidation on transitions S 0 →S 1 and S 0 →S 1 is close to one. These reactions apparently are not coupled to proton release. (2) There is a pronounced isotope effect on the S 2 →S 3 and S 3 →S 4 →S 0 transition where O 2 is produced. (3) The lag phase attributable to S 4 formation is prolonged by a factor of ~2 in D 2 O. (4) In D 2 O, there is evidence for a lag phase in the X-ray transient also in the S 2 →S 3 transition which has not previously been observed (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This lag is the first experimental evidence for an intermediate also in this Mn oxidizing reaction step. (5) At a higher pD the rates of Mn oxidation/reduction and of intermediate formation were similar to those in H 2 O, as expected for the compensation of H/D and pH effects. The H/D and pH effects reveal: (1) The fornation of the S 4 state is coupled to a deprotonation at the Mn complex and not to Mn oxidation. This deprotonation may be crucial for subsequent O 2 formation [**]. (2) The first observation of a lag in the S 2 -S 3 transition, particularly in D 2 O, may point to a crucial deprotonation reaction also in this step. It is highly important to characterize the nature of this state in further time-resolved X-ray experiments. The preliminary evidence for an intermediate in the S 2 -S 3 step may bring us closer to the characterization of all of the at least eight states [2] in the reaction cycle of water oxidation. 0 1 2 0 -0.5 S 2 →S 3 D 2 O time [ms] 0 1 2 0 -0.5 S 2 →S 3 D 2 O time [ms] -1 0 1 2 3 0,1 0 1 1E-3 0,01 0,1 tim e [m s] S 2 -S 3 S 3 -S 4 -S 0 -1 0 1 2 3 0,1 0 1 1E-3 0,01 0,1 tim e [m s] S 2 -S 3 S 3 -S 4 -S 0 0 1 1E-3 0,01 0,1 tim e [m s] S 2 -S 3 S 3 -S 4 -S 0 Fig. 2: Left: Kinetic X-ray transient on the S 2 →S 3 transition; red = simlation using two consecutive reactions, blue = single exponential fit, bottom = residual plots.

B. Friedrich, M. Driess, C. Limberg (all Berlin) and A. DeLacey, Madrid) on the single-crystal spectrometer at ID26 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). We are grateful for additional in-house beamtime. RIXS on ultra-dilute (1 mM metal) biological samples is feasible. Radiation damage can be minimized; the signal-to-noise ratio is reasonable.

<div><head>Conclusions:</head><p>. The results on the O 2 -evolving step are part of a manuscript in preparation. For the first time, preliminary evidence for a further intermediate in the S 2 -S 3 transition became visible. It is highly important to characterize this intermediate in future time-resolved X-ray experiments. Preliminary RIXS data have been collected at the Ni K-edge and the feasibility of RIXS on biological samples at ID26 was established. These challenging experiments are expected to provide high-resolution information on the atomic structure and also on the electronic configuration of metal sites in the future.We consider the April run as particularly successful. Valuable new information on intermediates in the O 2 -evolving reaction cycle of water oxidation has been obtained which supports our hypothesis of the involvement of crucial deprotonation reactions at the <rs type="institution">Mn complex</rs> <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.
