<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment, we focused on the body distribution of SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) in mice, with special attention to the biodistribution in liver and lung. Mice were exposed to SiO2 core shell NPs, containing a magnetic core of Fe4O3, by two different exposure routes (lung aspiration and intravenous (iv) injection) and organs were analysed by μXRF and XANES. The biodistribution in the lung and liver was assessed. At the same time, the composition of the SiO2 NPs was assessed by looking at the fitting of the Si and Fe signal. If the particles keep their original core-shell structure, both signals fit well. Millimetric parts of lung and liver were immersed in a water soluble embedding compound resin (FSC 22 from Leica Biosystems, Germany) and were frozen using methyl butane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Samples were sectioned at 15 µm thickness using a cryomicrotome. The sections were transferred to a freeze-drier using pre-cooled Al holders and freeze-dried for 12 hours. The sections were then mounted in a sample holder between two thin layers of ultralene foil.</p><p>The beam was focused to 0.3 x 1 (h x v) µm2 by means of Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror arrangement. Fluorescence signal is collected using a large-area (80 mm2) Bruker silicon drift placed at 60° scattering angle. Maps were recorded at 7.12 keV to avoid detector saturation by Fe signal and be able to record at the same time lower element signal like Si. Pixel size was 2 x 2 µm2 for the large maps and 0.5 x 0.5 µm2 for the small ones and integration time 100 and 150 ms per pixels, respectively. Fe K-edge XANES spectra were recorded to determine Fe speciation on Fe-rich pixels identified by XRF. Spectra were collected between 7.05 and 7.35 eV with a 0.6 eV step in continuous scan mode. At least ten spectra were recorded on each selected point in order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. XANES spectra were also recorded on the pure SiO2-Fe3O4 ENPs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intravenous injection exposure protocol</head><p>The elemental distribution of Fe and Si was studied by synchrotron XRF on thin liver sections. No spots of Fe and Si were observed in non-exposed control animals (data not shown). Liver slices of mice 7 and 84 days after intravenous exposure to SiO 2 -Fe 3 O 4 ENPs show clear spots of Fe and Si, with an overlap of both signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>). Maps collected with a 0.5 µm step on the Fe and Si-rich spots show spot sizes of around 5 µm. The XANES spectra of the two Fe-rich spots, collected after 84 days, show no differences in terms of position and shape of the pre-edge, white line (the most intensive peak) and oscillations, in comparison to the reference material (pure SiO 2 -Fe 3 O 4 ENPs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>). These results show that the SiO2 NPs are present in the liver, even 84 days after exposure. Furthermore, these results give strong evidence that the ENPs retain their original core-shell structure during the whole observation period  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intratracheal instillation exposure protocol</head><p>The elemental distribution of P, Fe and Si was studied by synchrotron XRF on thin lung sections. No spots of Fe and Si were observed in non-exposed control animals (data not shown). Spots of Fe and Si were observed 7 and 84 days after exposure to the ENPs, with an overlap of both signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). In both times, the P signal, showing cellular structures, correlated quite well with Fe-and Si-rich regions. The number of spots appears lower after 84 days than after 7 days. The XANES spectra of the Fe-rich spots, collected after 84 days, show no difference in terms of position and shape of the pre-edge, white line and oscillations, in comparison to the reference material (pure SiO2-Fe3O4 ENPs) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). The variations of intensity observed on the spectra of spot 1 can be assigned to self-absorption effect resulting from too high concentration of Fe in the investigated point. These results show that Fe and Si spots are omnipresent in lung tissue at 7 days after exposure, where only a few spots could be found after 84 days. This indicates that some SiO2 ENPs are still present in the lung. Furthermore, Fe and Si spots correlate quite well with the P signal, suggesting that the ENPs are taken up by cells. We hypothesize that the largest part of the instilled particles are taken up by alveolar macrophages and will be removed from the lung by respiratory mucociliary clearance.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific production</head><p>One paper is in review in the journal Particle and Fibre Toxicology: Abstract: Nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) is used nowadays in several biomedical applications such as drug delivery and cancer therapy, and is produced on an industrial scale as additive to paints and coatings, cosmetics and food. Data regarding the long-term biokinetics of SiO2 engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) is lacking. In this study, the whole-body biodistribution of SiO2 core-shell ENPs containing a paramagnetic core of Fe3O4 was investigated after a single exposure via intravenous injection or intratracheal instillation in mice. The distribution and accumulation in different organs was evaluated for a period of 84 days using several techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES). We demonstrated that intravenously administered SiO2 ENPs mainly accumulate in the liver, and are retained in this tissue for over 84 days. After intratracheal instillation, an almost complete particle clearance from the lung was seen after 84 days with distribution to spleen and kidney. Furthermore, we have strong evidence that the ENPs retain their original core-shell structure during the whole observation period. This work gives insight into the whole-body biodistribution of SiO2 ENPs and will provide guidance for further toxicity studies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Stijn Smulders, Peter Hoet</figDesc></figure>
