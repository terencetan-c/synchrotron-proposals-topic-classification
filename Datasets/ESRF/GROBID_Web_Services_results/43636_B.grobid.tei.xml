<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We studied the mechanical deformation of GaAs nanorods by combining the new in-situ "Two-Tower" atomic force microscope of ID01 and nanofocused X-ray diffraction. While in previous works, in-situ deformation studies were performed at one fixed Bragg angle only, we repeated the deformation studies at different rocking angles. These experiments at various rocking angles will pave the way to obatin in-situ the three-dimensional intensity distribution of mechanically deformed nanostructures and, thus, gaining more detailed information of the mechanical properties of individual nano-objects. For our current studies, the X-ray beam was focused to 250 x 350 nm 2 by means of a Fresnel zone plate. GaAs nanorods with a diameter of 600 nm and a height of 300 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>) were grown on a GaAs substrate by means of selective-area metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. For that purpose, a SiN x layer of thickness 15 nm is deposited on the substrate and subsequently structured by means of both electron beam lithography and wet chemical etching. The circular openings in the SiN x layer define the position of the rods grown afterwards. The two stacks of piezo stages of the new in-situ AFM allowed for the independent alignment of the sample and the AFM-tip with respect to the nanofocused X-ray beam. A scanning X-ray diffraction map (SXDM) of the sample and an absorption image of the AFM-tip at the GaAs (111) Bragg angle are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b</ref>) and (c), respectively. The SXDM shows both the quadratic arrangement of the GaAs nanorods and a clear separation of neighbouring pillars enabling us to select an individual rod with the nanofocused X-ray beam. When scanning the AFM-tip through the X-ray focus, the tip may either block the direct beam or the X-rays diffracted from the sample. Thus, two shadows of the AFM-tip are visible in the absorption image. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>), the upper shadow originates from the absorption of the direct beam while the lower one is caused by the absorption of the X-rays diffracted from the sample. The position of the X-ray focal spot is located in the center between the two shadows being marked by a cross. After alignment, the AFM-tip is brought into contact with the selected nanorod and, subsequently, it is moved down stepwise increasing the force applied on the pillar. After reaching a certain deformation the AFM-tip is retracted stepwise. This compression test was repeated at different rocking angles. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> presents two sequences of nano-XRD images for a GaAs pillar during compression taken at two different rocking angles. The two series were taken close to the GaAs (111) Bragg peak of the nanorods and the GaAs substrate. In the first images of the first sequence, the crystal trunction rod (CTR) of the substrate, the Bragg peak of the GaAs nanorods, and the diffuse Bragg signal of the GaAs substrate are visible. For the second serie, the substrate CTR and the substrate Bragg peak overlap and cannot be distinguished anymore. While increasing the pressure applied on the nanorod the intensity of the nanorod's Bragg signal decreases, the intensity of the substrate Bragg peak increases, and, finally, an additional flare appears at a q z position larger than for the substrate Bragg peak. Thus, the atomic lattice of the nanorod is compressed during the experiment to the same value as the substrate and even beyond. During the experiment the substrate CTR stays at the same position proving that the sample does not tilt under pressure application. Every two-dimensional diffraction image represents only a cut through reciprocal space whereas every sample is three-dimensional. Consequently, the ultimate goal is the in-situ measurement of the threedimensional intensity distribution in the reciprocal space of the nanostructure under investigation. Thus, our new approach of performing in-situ compression tests at various rocking angles will enable us to record a complete three-dimensional reciprocal space map and gain information about the deformation of single nanostructures in-situ.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: a) Scanning electron micrograph and b) scanning X-ray diffraction map at the GaAs(111) Bragg peak of GaAs nanorods. c) Scanning absorption image of the AFM-tip.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,47.52,626.64,578.40,265.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
