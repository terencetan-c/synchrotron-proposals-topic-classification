Diffraction peaks of the HP-phase could be indexed exactly to the GLVWRUWHG corundum structure with. space group 3EQD. This structure with formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">$</formula><p>2 2 3 can be assigned only in case of a single cation position. This is in full agreement with the recent obtained Mössbauer data revealing a single MS component at P&gt;72 GPa [2]. 1. T. Suzuki, T. Yagi, A. Akimoto, A. Ito, S. Morimoto, and S. Syono, in 6ROLG 6WDWH 3K\VLFV XQGHU 3UHVVXUH p. 149, KTK Scient. Publ., Tokyo (1985); J. Staun Olsen, C. S. G. Cousins, L. Gerward, H. Jhans,, and B. J. Sheldon, 3K\VLFD 6FULSWD , 327 (1991). 2. M.

The XRD studies of PrFeO 3 performed to ~ 52 GPa, have shown that at ~30 GPa the low-pressure orthorhombic perovskite phase (space group 3EQP) starts undergoing a first order phase transition to a new high pressure (HP) phase. The diffraction patterns of the pure HP phase recorded at 52 GPa could be tentatively attributed to the same orthorhombic perovskite structure but with a reduced Faxis The first-order phase transition is accompanied by a ~2% volume decrease and a precipitous drop, by more than four orders of magnitude, of the resistance explained as due to an accelerated gap-closure.</p><p>Further pressure increase causes a sluggish metallization process with an incipient metallic state at ~130 GPa as well as a a VSLQFURVVRYHU process, from a high to a low-spin Fe 3+ . To elucidate the nature of these electronic and magnetic transformations a further XRD studies to higher pressures is necessary.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>RI DSSOLFDQWV (* indicates experimentalists): Moshe Pasternak, School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University Gregory Rozenberg, School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University 5HSRUW: +LJK3UHVVXUH 6WUXFWXUH RI )H 2 . The high-pressure (HP) form of hematite has been the subject of extensive investigation primarily because of its significance to earth sciences. Early HP experiments have shown that at 50 GPa Fe 2 O 3 undergoes a structural phase transformation to a considerably denser structure, with a volume decrease of ~ 10% [1]. This phase could be equivalently assigned to a GLVWRUWHG corundum (Rh 2 O 3 II-type) or orthorhombic perovskite structure. Based on HP Mössbauer studies (MS) it was concluded that the HP phase is characterized by iron ions of WZR different valences. This incited Suzuki HW DO [1] to favor the perovskite option to the HP phase with formula $%2</figDesc></figure>

They are 0RWW insulators, which driven by temperature, undergo a metal-insulator transition with the concurrent loss of the Ni 3+ moments [1]. Though this temperature-driven phenomena has been observed only with 5NiO 3 , we have recently selected the Pr-orthoferrite, to investigate the structural aspects of the basic phenomena of GG FRUUHODWLRQ EUHDNGRZQ resulting from very high static pressures.</figDesc></figure>
