<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Ga 2 O 3 is a transparent semiconducting oxide (TSO) with fascinating optical and electrical properties. It covers a band gap between 4.7 eV and 5.3 eV, very closely related to its five polytypes (α throung ɛ ). Due to the large value among all TSOs, it is considered as a promising candidate in various applications such as deep UV photodetectors, high power electronics and gas sensors. On the way to commercial applications there are, however, still several issues that need to be addressed, especially the requirement for single-phase formation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>The a-plane sapphire substrate is loaded in a plasma-assisted MBE with indium bonding on a piece of silicon. Except for the 700 o C substrate temperature, the growth condition remains the same: T ga =900 o C, flux of gallium=2E-7mbar, O 2 flux=1sccm, plasma power=300W, background pressure=3E-6mbar. The estimated growth rate is around 0.4Å/s and the growth time is set to be 86 seconds and 260 seconds. After the growth, the layers are characterized by AFM to probe the surface morphology and then checked at BESSY II by the synchrotron radiation beam line U125-2_KMC with the photon energy of 10KeV.</p><p>The [11.0] crystal truncation rod (CTR) of the α-phase Ga 2 O 3 layer, as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (A)</ref>, has the same scale of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) with the single crystal Al 2 O 3 substrate, 0.014° and 0.012°. The narrow FWHM of the Ga 2 O 3 layer can be explained by an ideal stacking of the atoms in the layer with rare stacking faults and misorientation in the specular direction. The grazing incidence diffraction (GID) in [00.1] direction probes the in-plane crystal property of Ga 2 O 3 layer. The FWHM of the Ga 2 O 3 (00.6) peak is 1.129°, 56 times larger than the FWHM of the substrate. The broad FWHM can be explained by the in-plane misorientation of the nano-grains. According to the Scherrer equation, with a dimensionless shape factor of 0.9, the mean-grain size is about 5.7nm. Compared with the structure of the ideal α-phase Ga 2 O 3 bulk crystal, the epilayer is relaxed in both specular [11.0] direction and in-plane [00.1] direction. So the broad FWHM in the in-plane direction is mainly caused by the in-plane misorietation of the nano-grains but not strain. Both AFM and SEM measurement on the surface of the epilayer show a hilly structure.  The thickness of the α-phase Ga 2 O 3 layer is 6.59nm as indicated by the [11.0] diffraction fringes. However, on a c-plane sapphire substrate, the α-phase Ga 2 O 3 layer is only stable in the first 2nm either grown by MBE or PLD or MOVPE, and subsequently transfer into the thermodynamically stable β phase. Therefore, it seems like that the α-phase Ga 2 O 3 grows more stable on a-plane sapphire substrate. The mismatch in the c plane is just half of the mismatch in (11.0) plane, 3% to 5.6%, which causes smaller in-plane strain in the (11.0) Ga 2 O 3 layer growth.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and outlook</head><p>The α-phase Ga 2 O 3 can be grown on a-plane sapphire substrate with very high crystal quality in respect of the out-of-plane CTR. Since there is no phase transfer from α-phase Ga 2 O 3 to β-phase Ga 2 O 3 , it seems like the αphase Ga 2 O 3 has more stable growth in [11.0] than [00.1] direction. The in-plane GID shows large FWHM of the RC and AFM and SEM indicates a hilly surface, however these could be improved by further study in the MBE growth.</p><p>The a-plane sapphire substrate may give us a chance to produce high quality single crystal α-phase Ga 2 O 3 thin film for further study on the property of α-phase Ga 2 O 3 . With the HR-XRD in a synchrotron radiation facility, it would be interesting to grow α-phase Ga 2 O 3 layer with different thickness from several mono layers to tens of nanometers, in order to study the strain relaxation process in the Ga 2 O 3 thin film. Besides that, the influence of the growth conditions on the size of the in-plane nano-grains should also be investigated trying to understand the growth mechanism in the α-phase Ga 2 O 3 and subsequently achieve the growth of single crystal α-phase Ga 2 O 3 .</p></div>			</div>
