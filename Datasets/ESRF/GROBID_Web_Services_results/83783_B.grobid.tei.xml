<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Bacteria containing benzoyl-coenzyme A reductases (BCR) play a crucial role in the degradation of aromatic compounds. The mild conditions may serve as inspiration for an environmentally-friendly alternative to the harsh Birch reduction regularly used in synthetic inorganic chemistry. Recently a subunit of a class II BCR from Deltaproteinbacterium Geobacter metallireducens was shown to contain a Wbispyranopterin monophosphate active site (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, left) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Our aim was to understand the electronic structure of the active site and identify an unknown ligand as well as disclose the oxidation state of tungsten.</p><p>During the assigned beam time, we collected W Lb 3 high-energy resolution fluorescence detected Xray absorption (HERFD) spectra from the subunit of a benzoyl-coenzyme A reductase (BamBC) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, left) and several model complexes with different oxidation states (a: W(0), b: W(II), c: W(IV). d: W(VI), Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, right). The samples were kept at ~10 K by using a LHe-cooled cryostat. W Lb 3 HERFD were collected by scanning the L 1 -edge XAS, while monitoring the W Lb 3 emission line (9819 eV) using Si(660) crystals at 80.55°. Radiation damage tests were performed to assess the maximum dose per spot. Comparing the spectra for the protein with and without dienoyl-CoA as substrate it is possible to see a small shift in the rising edge to lower energy for the sample with dienoyl-CoA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This shift can be assigned to a lowering in the W oxidation state, which is consistent with literature 1 . The spectra on the right side of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show a comparison between the two different protein preparations and four selected model compounds. It is nicely visible that the compounds with two or more CO ligands show distinct spectra compared to the protein ones. Only the fourth compound (d) with three dithiolene ligands and therefore six sulfurs bound to the W overlaps really nicely with both protein spectra. This is consistent with the crystal structure showing two dithiolenes and a cysteine ligand (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In addition, the W L 1 -edge seems to be sensitive to changes in the local site symmetry around the tungsten atom showing tremendous differences in the edge intensities for compound a and b.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the comparison between an experimentally measured spectrum and a spectrum calculated using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). It can be ascertained that the TDDFT calculations can really nicely reproduce the experimental spectra especially for the edge and the pre-edge region and will therefore help to understand the electronic structure for the different tungsten compounds and the protein.</p><p>Overall it can be summarized that the L 1 -edge shows sensitivity for changes in the oxidation state of tungsten as well as for changes in the local site symmetry around tungsten. Compared to the featureless L 3edge, the L 1 -edge seems to be a powerful tool for analyzing tungsten compounds and tungsten containing proteins using x-ray absorption spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . With support from TDDFT calculations it should be possible to increase the information we can get from the W L 1 -edge and build up a good basis for a calibration study on tungsten compounds using XAS spectroscopy in combination with TDDFT calculations. The results of these studies are presently being prepared for publication. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: left: X-ray structure of the BisWPT cofactor in the BamBC subunit; right: Different model compounds, a: [W(Me 2 pidpt(CO) 4 ]; b: [W(mdt)(CO) 4 ], c: [W(mdt) 2 (CO) 2 ], d: [W(mdt) 3 ].</figDesc><graphic coords="2,58.33,589.45,213.60,155.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
