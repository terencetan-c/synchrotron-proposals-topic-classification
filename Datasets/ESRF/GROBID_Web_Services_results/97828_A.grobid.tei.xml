<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Short description of the actual experiment</head><p>The aim of this beamtime was to gain insights into the metal alloy formation and evolution of Ni-Fe/SiO2 and Ni-Cu/SiO2 CO2 hydrogenation catalysts by operando ASAXS. To realize ASAXS, we performed operando SAXS experiments at 5 different energies around the Fe, Ni, and Cu K edge first during reduction where metal alloy formation takes place and subsequently during CO2 hydrogenation. Hereby, we measured ASAXS during both ramping and holding steps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Importantly, the holding steps were adjusted to the possibilities at BM02, i.e., we considered all motor movements and recording times for the images both with and without kapton. These operando experiments were conducted in a self-supplied setup, which was inserted at BM02. Our setup comprised a capillary cell with integrated IR-heaters, a gas rig with various MFC's and gas filters, a temperature controller, and a gas chromatograph to simultaneously conduct product analysis. Before starting the experiments, we decided to slightly modify the planned operando ASAXS experiments by additionally adding a WAXS detector so that we finally performed operando ASAXS-WAXS experiments at BM02. The addition of the WAXS detector did not affect the ASAXS experiments but rather enabled to yield additional information on the catalysts. Eventually, we will combine the ASAXS-WAXS results with those from product analysis to deduce a fundamental understanding of synergistic effects in bimetallic catalysts and their influence on catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation. This is particularly important for the rational design of next generation bimetallic catalysts for CO2 valorization and our journey towards a more circular economy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Difficulties encountered during the experiment</head><p>We had several beam losses and one very long beam loss of 9 h due to issues of the storage ring. These beam losses induced problems for the operando experiments as we had to pause the current program step. However, pausing such a complex reaction program (total time ~11 h) is not possible at each step. Hence, we had to abord several measurements and restart the experiment after the beam was back with a new sample, which was very time-intensive. In view of the limited time, we had to adjust our plans and decided to focus on the influence of varying additional metal, i.e., replacing Fe by Cu, by measuring 2 Ni-Fe/SiO2 and the corresponding Ni-Cu/SiO2 catalysts. Hence, the influence of varying metal ratio on both Ni-Fe/SiO2 and Ni-Cu/SiO2 catalysts could not be investigated operando in this beamtime. To complete the proposed study by measuring operando ASAXS-WAXS at the Ni-Fe/SiO2 and Ni-Cu/SiO2 catalysts with varying metal ratio, additional beamtime would be needed. All catalysts are SiO2-supported metal(oxides) with only 6wt% total metal loading. Therefore, we expected that the signal from SiO2 and the metal particles cannot be entirely deconvoluted and we decided to perform a complete operando ASAXS-WAXS experiment with a capillary filled only with SiO2. Moreover, as all catalysts were located inside a glass capillary, we additionally performed a complete operando experiment with an empty capillary as background measurement. In view of the complexity of the supported bimetallic catalysts, we decided together with the local contacts that it is worth to spend a comparatively long time on measuring possible backgrounds, which might become beneficial for the data analysis after the beamtrip. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exemplary results</head><p>Currently, we are still in the process of data analysis. As the normalization is crucial for ASAXS, N. Genz is in close contact with F. De Geuser to optimize the data analysis. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> exemplarily depicts some slight changes (intensity and slope) in the scattering curves dependent on both Ni energy and sample, i.e., varying Ni/Fe ratio (Ni/Fe higher for pink curves). From Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> it is evident that (1) SiO2 shows the same scattering curves independent of temperature and gas composition (2) Ni-Fe/SiO2 shows slightly different scattering curves compared to SiO2 (3) Ni-Fe/SiO2 shows a temperature-and gas composition-dependency. Based on the preliminary data processing, we can already conclude that we reveal both changes in the scattering curves between the different samples, i.e., varying additional metal and varying metal ratio (note although we could only conduct operando experiments for 2 different metal ratios being not sufficient for profound conclusions, various metal ratios were measured ex situ to get a first impression about metal ratio dependent differences in preparation for a future beamtime), and during the operando experiments, i.e., varying temperature and gas composition which is related to the reduction (metal alloy formation) and CO2 hydrogenation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Scheme of the performed operando experiments at BM02.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,67.15,230.03,466.63,123.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
