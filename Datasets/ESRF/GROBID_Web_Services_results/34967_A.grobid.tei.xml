<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The original purpose of the beamtime was to study the excimer formation in thin films of Perylene in the αform. In a previous beamtime<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> we saw some promising results, which we were going to investigate further during this beamtime. Unfortunately the chopper used at ID09b to create the very short X-ray pulses was being repaired for the full duration of our scheduled beamtime, hence only a time resolution of 50µs was obtainable, which is much to slow for us to observe the excimer formation or decay, as we have seen in previous experiments that the system is back to its original state within 30µs after laser excitation.</p><p>We instead used the beamtime to test and implement several improvements to our experimental setup, which will allow us to better control our experiment. We also examined the long term heating effects arising from continuous laser irradiation, which we have observed in earlier experiments, hoping to gain a better understanding of this and possibly find a way of avoiding the heat build-up in the sample during future timeresolved experiments without having to decrease the laser intensity.</p><p>The first improvement we implemented was a second motor allowing us to rotate not only the phi angle, but also the chi angle -the idea is that running the motor continuously during X-ray exposure will allow us to average over several of the nano-crystallites in the sample, which will give a smoother peak structure and thus allow us to better determine the time evolution of the peak positions. Also rotating the sample during exposure will give each sample site a longer break between laser and X-ray exposures, which we hope will not only lengthen the lifetime of the sample but also help eliminate the long term heating effects. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> rotating the sample during the X-ray exposure really smoothes the peak giving us a much better peak profile for determining the peak center, which will be a great help for determining the peak shifts observed in earlier experiments.</p><p>The second improvement is the addition of a spectrometer, which will allow us to monitor the fluorescence spectra of the sample during the experiments. This will not only make it possible for us to ensure that excimers are being formed after laser excitation, but also allow us to optimize the number of excimers by looking at the fluorescence signal, while changing different parameters like laser polarization and intensity. Finally it will allow us monitor any changes in the sample quality during the experiments. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) Fluorescence spectrum recorded with the spectrometer showing the number of photon counts as a function of wavelength. The broad peak is the excimer fluorescence and the small thin peak is leftover 800nm from the laser.</p><p>We were able to see the fluorescence from the excimers as seen in spectrum in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, but we discovered that the spectrometer was probing the fluorescence from a too large area of the sample, hence we were not able to see when the sample were destroyed in the X-ray probed area just by looking at the fluorescence spectra. To A) B)</p><p>solve this problem we are at the moment making and imaging setup, which will allow us to image just a small area of the sample onto the fiber of the spectrometer; this will hopefully give us the needed sensitivity for these experiments.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> The final setup after all improvements were added.</p><p>To study the long term heating effects we kept the sample stationary and recorded a series with the time delays 0, 100, 300 and 900µs and compared the images to laser off images at different laser intensities and different cooling conditions. This allowed us to investigate if the sample was back to its original temperature before being hit by the next laser pulse, if the sample is not back to its original temperature before the next excitation pulse hits the sample, it will slowly heat up during the experiment, which might influence our results or at least complicate the data analysis. We discovered that even just having the cryostat letting out a very small air stream keeping the sample at room temperature had a positive effect and helped the sample release the excess heat that the laser excitation produces in the sample.</p><p>To sum up the results, despite the problems with the beamline chopper, the excellent support from the beamline staff made it possible for us to have a very productive beamtime, where we managed to implement two improvements that will help us a great deal in future experiments. Also we managed to study the long term heating effects, which have been giving us trouble in the data analysis and found ways of reducing them greatly.</p><p>Spectrometer Second rotation stage Sample Cryostat</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 )</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1) Images of a peak with and without rotating the sample during X-ray exposure.
