<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this proposal is to study the structural changes taking place under working conditions in MgO-based CO2-sorbents. Total scattering experiments have been carried out during carbonation and regeneration processes on a NaNO3-modified MgO sorbent in cyclic operation. For this experiment, the material, MgO-20NaNO3 (molar ratio NaNO3/MgO=0.2), was prepared by mixing MgO and NaNO3 powders. The experiments were carried out in a quartz capillary cell (1.0 mm outer diameter) heated by a gas blower. The sample was first pre-treated at 450 °C under N2 (7 ml/min); and afterwards subjected to 10 cycles of carbonation-regeneration. The carbonation was performed at 315 °C, under a flow of 7 ml/min of CO2, followed by a regeneration step at 450 °C under 7 ml/min of N2. The overall time of the cyclic experiment was ~26 hours. Reference compounds (MgO, MgCO3, NaNO3) were studied under in situ conditions (ramp from 50°C to 315°C under 7 ml/min N2 for MgO and NaNO3 and under 7 ml/min CO2 for MgCO3).</p><p>The wavelength was set to 0.1771 Å and the data were collected using a Pilatus3 X CdTe 2M detector positioned at two different sample-to-detector distances (d=83cm and d=23cm for XRD and PDF data analysis, respectively). The data acquisition during each carbonation cycle was the following: i) Time resolved (1s) XRD data were acquired at during the first 50 min of carbonation process to capture the fast changes that may occurring at the beginning of the carbonation stage (as observed in a previous experiment MA-3415). ii) In the following 40 min of carbonation, XRD and PDF data were acquired alternately (time resolution=60s). We should mention that several problems with the data acquisition software occurred during experiment. The ESRF local contact and computing staff have intervened actively to solve the problems. The overall experiment gave relevant information about the carbonation and regeneration processes. Rietveld refinements of the data in reciprocal space as well as the analysis in real space by PDF have been performed using TOPAS software package. The results of Rietveld refinement combined with kinetic modelling (Avrami-Erofeev model) show the deactivation-activation behavior of the sorbent, which has been attributed to the interplay between increase in average crystallite size of MgO and formation of minor amounts of additional Na2CO3/Na2Mg(CO3)2 phases (to the best of our knowledge they have never been reported to form during the cycling before). The formation of the phases is associated with the partial decomposition of the molten promoter during regeneration step and further interaction of the decomposition products with CO2 during the carbonation step. The results of the combined XRD and PDF analyses provide comprehensive understanding of factors affecting the cyclic performance of the sorbent (both for crystalline phases and liquid promoter). A manuscript summarizing the obtained observations is currently under preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
