<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the experiment CH-3240 the potential formation at high pressures and temperatures of non molecular CO 2 /SiO 2 alloys with the C and Si cations in tetrahedral coordination by oxygen was investigated by reacting CO 2 with various forms of SiO 2 . This kind of alloy was predicted to exist by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and its discovery would give rise to a completely new class of oxides of great interest for fundamental chemistry, Earth science and materials science. We already discovered the high P-T formation of disordered carbonate compounds between CO 2 and SiO 2 (silicon carbonate), at 20-25 GPa and 300-700 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. After this, it became soon clear that the formation of crystalline, tetrahedral alloys would have required more extreme P-T conditions. In fact, pressure in excess of 30-40 GPa and temperatures above 700 K are needed, where it is shown that CO 2 itself forms non molecular solids built up of CO 4 units <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>We tryed to obtain tetrahedral CO 2 /SiO 2 alloys under pressures and temperatures of 40-50 GPa and 1500-2000 K, respectively, using CO 2 laser heated DACs, by chemical reactions of CO2 and various silica based solids such as silicalite (a pure SiO 2 zeolite), quartz nanopowder and silicic acid, [SiOx(OH)4-2x]n. The temperature quenched samples were analyzed by the XRD on ID27. The CO 2 laser (10.6 microns wavelength, power of 60 W, 40 microns spot) resonates with IR absorption bands of silica and non molecular CO 2 , therefore it is directly absorbed by the sample, not requiring the use of additional absorbing materials as otherwise needed with using NIR lasers (Nd:YAG). This allows to simplify the reaction environment and to avoid unwanted chemical reactions. Also, in order to make the environment very simple and clean we did not use coating on the diamond surface, which in turn limited the high temperatures actually achieved and the thermal stability of the sample.</p><p>In all the investigated samples we always got a macroscopic mixture of tetrahedrally coordinated CO 2 (phase V) and octahedral SiO 2 , stishovite, whereas the expected CO 2 /SiO 2 tetrahedral alloys where never observed. A possible rationale for this is that the P-T range where CO 2 is thermodynamically stable in the tetrahedral forms, as phase V, corresponds to P-T conditions where instead SiO 2 is stable in the octahedral form (SiO 6 ). In other words the P-T range where CO 2 and SiO 2 are tetrahedrally coordinated do not seem to overlap, which most likely prevents the formation of the alloy. Nevertheless, the formation of a metastable tetrahedral alloy could always be possible in some P-T intervals, maybe at intermediate temperatures between 700 K, where the silicon carbonate forms, and 1500 K where CO 2 and SiO 2 chemically separate each other and form CO 2 -V and stishovite, respectively.</p><p>The experiment presented a very positive outcome. In fact, the very clean laser heating preocedure allowed us to prepare additional samples made of pure CO 2 in order to study the structure fo the remarkable phase V, whose determination was the matter of a long standing debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Based on high quality CO 2 -V samples, we performed a very reliable Rietveld refinement of the structure of this material, which assessed phase V to be in a partially collapsed variant of SiO 2 betacristobalite, space group I 4 2d, in which the CO 4 tetrahedra are tilted by 38.4° about the c-axis (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The existence of CO 4 tetrahedra (average O-C-O angle of 109.5°) is thus confirmed. The results add to the knowledge of carbon chemistry with mineral phases similar to SiO 2 and potential implications for Earth and planetary interiors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we understood that a tetrahedral alloy including CO 4 groups could be obtained, in principle, by reacting CO 2 with other oxides which remain tetrahedral at high P-T conditions, such as BPO 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We then prepared two samples made of a mixture of CO 2 and BPO 4 and performed laser heating (1500-2000 K) at pressures of 40-50 GPa. Although this run was very preliminary, we probably achieved some hint of the existence of a tetrahedral CO 2 /BPO 4 alloy. We now think this study urgently needs a follow up in near future synchrotron XRD runs, that we intend to propose. It is likely that more extreme temperatures (2500-3000K) are required to complete the reaction between CO 2 and BPO 4 . We are confident to achieve this temperature range by upgrading the laser heating procedure.</p></div>
