<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Imaging the in vivo dynamics of regional lung ventilation and blood perfusion in an experimental model of asthma Rationale and Objectives: A hallmark of asthma is airway inflammation and an exaggerated narrowing in response to environmental stimuli, leading to regional abnormalities in lung ventilation. Defects in regional ventilation are significant because they alter gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, and impact the distribution of inhaled drugs in asthmatic subjects. The importance of understanding the structure and function of very peripheral airways and lung acini (clusters of alveoli) in asthma has been appreciated only recently. Post-mortem examination shows extensive disease in peripheral airways and alveoli in asthma. However, there are currently no data on how regional lung ventilation, blood perfusion and tissue geometry change during the course of a single breath, during an asthma attack. This is due to the lack of quantitative imaging techniques with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to allow the study the dynamics of regional lung function in vivo. The aim of this experiment was to assess the within-tidal dynamic changes in regional lung gas and blood volume, in an experimental model of asthma in rabbit, using a novel approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>The experients were performed in 10 anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (Wt ∼3 kg) at baseline and during acute bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of methacholine (MCH). The animals were mechanically ventilated in volume control mode with an infant ventilator (vt = 6 ml/kg; I:E =0.5; PEEP=3 cmH 2 O). K-edge subtraction imaging was performed on ID17, successively at 34.56 and 33.17 keV, using a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ge detector, allowing for continuous tomographic acquisitions at 350 µm pixel resolution over 2-3 min. True time resolution was 720 projections/s. We used a gaited imaging sequence (see: MD679 report), where projection images were collected continously during ∼3 min of breathing, during steady-state inhalation of 70% Xe, or injection of iodine.</p><p>Results: Quantitative images of inhaled Xe, injected Iodine and simultaneous tissue-density images included in each data set, were acquired. These data can be post-reconstructed to reproduce a single representative respiratory cycle as 30 consecutive images. These data, currently still under analysis, will allow us to produce for the first time, a video of the withinbreath regional changes in blood and gas volumes during a respiratory cycle in rabbit lung.</p><p>An example of the changes in static distribution of regional blood volume before and after the induction of acute bronchoconstriction (asthma attack) by MCH inhalation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, obtained by standard KES imaging for comparison with the gaited images.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Sample static KES images showing the regional distribution of iodine in blood within the lung and surrounding tisuues. A: in vivo image at baseline in healthy lung; B: after MCH inhalation (asthma attack). Note the apearance of regional lung perfusion defects (white arrow). Regional blood volume is measured based on regional iodine and corresponding tissue density. Note central blood vessels and cardiac chambers (red). Color scale represents: 0 (black), 1.2 mg/ml (blue), 6.5 mg/ml (red).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The experiment was successful in acquiring the necessary data that will allow reconstructing dynamic maps of within-breath changes in regional lung gas and blood volume distributions, both in healthy lung and in follwing acute bronchocontriction. Since this is a time-consuming analysis, the present is a preliminary report. However, given the quality and quantity of obtained data, we expect to fulfill the main objectives of the study.</p><p>A B</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): S.
