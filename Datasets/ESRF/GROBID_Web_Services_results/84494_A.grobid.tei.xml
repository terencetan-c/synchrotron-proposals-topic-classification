<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental report on Proposals ID : 20160911 (BM32)</head><p>Interfacial coupling for FeRh clusters deposited on a BaTiO 3 crystalline surface</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Background</head><p>Controlling magnetism by means of an electric field is a key issue for future developments of low power spintronic that would reconcile electronic and magnetic devices. The major importance of surface atoms in small nanoparticles offers the opportunity to tailor the magnetic properties by playing with the interface between a nanomagnet and its surrounding. FeRh has attracted a lot of attention because, when it is in the chemically ordered B2 phase (CsCl-like), it presents an antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order (AFM-FM) transition close to room temperature. Moreover, in this system the crystalline and magnetic properties are intimately linked (magneto-elastic effects). Recently for epitaxially grown FeRh films <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> both strain and field effects from an underneath BaTiO 3 ferroelectric crystal has been exploited to electrically drive, with only a few volts, the FeRh metamagnetic transition temperature (just above room temperature).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample preparation and Characterization</head><p>We have previously studied the structural and intrinsic magnetic properties of FeRh nanoclusters, prepared using Mass-Selected Low Energy Cluster Beam Deposition (MS-LECBD) available at the PLYRA platform of Institut Lumière Matière. In sharp contrast to film and bulk studies, we have put into evidence the persistence of FM order down to 3 K (ferromagnetic alignment of the Fe and Rh magnetic moments of respectively 3 and 1 μ B in size-selected 3.3 nm diameter FeRh clusters crystallized in the B2 phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This anomalous magnetic order has been ascribed to finite size induced structural relaxation.</p><p>In the present case, FeRh nanoclusters have been deposited on a crystalline BaTiO 3 layer epitaxially grown on a Nb-doped SrTiO 3 layer, using a MBE technique (at INL-ECL). Different particle sizes have been studied (3 and 6 nanometers) thanks to the size-selection capabilities of the MSLECBD setup, with a relative diameter dispersion lower than 10 % on the surface (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), but ensuring a large enough diffraction signal. Samples deposited at room temperature have been compared with deposition at higher temperature (200-300°C). The nanoparticle samples are then capped by amorphous carbon (protection against oxidation) before x-ray measurements at ESRF but also by Pt capping layer which can be used as the top electrode for measurements involving electric manipulation. We have also studied uncapped samples transferred under UHV between Lyon and Grenoble (thanks to a UHV suitcase, already successfully used for previous experiments at BM32 on our deposited clusters).</p><p>In the following table, are listed the samples probed by GISAXS and XRD during this experiment</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental results</head><p>The sample which gave us the best results was TM17-33. At the moment, only results on this sample have been meticulously analyzed, as follow:</p><p>1. GISAXS (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> on the left) and XRD before annealing 2. Incremental thermal treatment from 250°C to 600°C 3. During annealing, characterization of the sample with GISAXS and fast HKL scans in &lt;100&gt; and in &lt;110&gt; directions 4. After annealing at 600°C for several hours (typically a night), back to RT and GISAXS and XRD characterizations As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> from TEM observations, performed prior to the run at ESRF, the 3 nm in diameters FeRh nanoparticles (NPs) are composed of several smaller clusters. We hoped that the morphology would become more spherical upon annealing. The thermal evolution of the GISAXS patterns is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. First of all, the absence of remarkable form factor which could be due to the partitioning of the as-prepared sample is seen on the left. While after annealing, a monodisperse shape can be assumed from the form factor evidenced on the right pattern with the apparition of an intense form factor around the direct beam. On the figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, from XRD scans performed before annealing, we can see the BTO peaks surrounded by a lot of features and small peaks which are mostly artifacts (at the top). The peak situated at 0.22 nm corresponds to the Molybdenum sample holder. While after annealing (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> at the bottom), it is possible to see some changes in the two peaks situated at 0.15 nm and 0.212 nm both on the &lt;010&gt; (red curve) and &lt;-1-10&gt; (blue curve) directions, which correspond to two epitaxial relationships as presented on the right of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Indeed, the peaks at 0.212 nm on the red curve and at 0.15 nm on the blue curve, represent the well-known epitaxial relationship as shown on the top of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. While the peaks at 0.15 nm on the red curve and the one at 0.212 nm on the blue curve, are coherent with a new relationship rotated to the previous configuration, depicted on the bottom. Such 'cube on cube' relationship has never been observed on thin films. In order to confirm those relationships, we did omega scans and omega maps. A map has been taken in the [HK0] plane starting from [H,K,L] = [0,1.68,0] to [H,K,L] = [0,2.88,0]. On this map, at K = 1.85 it is possible to see highlight every 45° corresponding to the known epitaxy and the new epitaxy. The omega scan has been probed out of the plane, at the [111] bragg peak and visible on the Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>One can underline that it is the first evidence of epitaxial relationship between the faces of nanocrystallites pre-formed in gas phase and a mono-crystalline oxide surface. Moreover, these specific interface coupling between FeRh clusters and the BaTiO 3 surface would pave the way towards the manipulation of the atomic structure, and hence the magnetic properties, through a voltage-driven control of the ferroelectric (and piezoelectric) substrate.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="1,136.52,589.81,350.00,150.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
