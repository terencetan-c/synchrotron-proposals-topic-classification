<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the strain effects on the exotic magnetic properties of the large spin orbit driven Mott Insulator Sr2IrO4, with Jeff=1/2 ground state. The experiment was undertaken at the XMAS CRG beamline, using X-ray Resonant Scattering (XRS) with photon tuned to the Ir L3 absorption edge. The experiment focussed on investigations, the correlation lengths, temperature dependence and azimuthal dependence of the thin films in the thickness range of 20nm to 120nm. The first part of the experiment were performed in zero field and the second part in applied magnetic field. The Ir L3 absorption edge, is know. to produce very large XRS magnetic signal in Sr2IrO4, which we exploited to investiged the magnetic structure of our thin films down to 20nm thickness, even using the moderate flux of a bending magnetic beamline of the ESRF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Part I -Zero Field Studies.</head><p>The main results found in the films in zero field it that we found a dramatic tuning of the c-axis magnetic correlation length out of plan of the films, by varying the thin film thickness. The magnetic scattering because very sharp and strong above a critical thin thickness of around 60nm as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a&amp;b</ref>. Surprisingly, we find that this growth in the magnetic correlation length is independent of the film strain state, but only the film thickness. As shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, the magnetic correlation length grows irrespective of the film strain state (tensile or compressive strain) and follows an easy to model power law function. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Part II -Applied Magnetic Field Studies.</head><p>Bulk Sr2IrO4 is known to undergo a metamagnetic phase transition at about B=0.2T, with a change of magnetic structure. The nominal magnetic reflections defined at (1 0 4n) and (0 1 4n+2) change to become (1 0 2n+1) and (0 1 2n+1) type reflections. We have discovered a dramatic switching of the c-axis magnetic correlation length from long range order to short range order under applied magnetic field, which is not observed in the bulk material (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This effect is not reported in the bulk material and further enriches the results of the tuning of the magnetic correlation length with. thickness described above.</p></div>

A dramatic change in the Lscans is observed in applied field, reflecting the switching from long range magnetic order to short range order. Similar effects are not observed in the in-plane H and K scans. The effect is not reported in the bulk compound.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1(a) (left).
