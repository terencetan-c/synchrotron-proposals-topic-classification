<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It as been found from previous measurements that even at rather low temperatures the hexahydride phase (Li 3 AlD 6 ), from the decomposition of LiAlD 4 , was partially decomposed, see Eq. 1 and 2. 3LiAlD 4 →Li 3 AlD 6 + 2Al +D 2.</p><p>(1) Li 3 AlD6 →3LiD + Al +3/2D 2.</p><p>(2)</p><p>For this reason, the isothermal decomposition of (i) pure Li 3 AlD 6 , (ii) Li 3 AlD 6 added with 2 mol% VCl 3 , and (iii) Li 3 AlD 6 added with 2 mol% 3TiCl 3 .AlCl 3 has been studied. The purposes of these measurements were to get quantitative measurements of these second decompositions as well as clear insight on this reaction. For all samples diffraction diagrams were collected at five temperatures, for the undoped sample: <ref type="bibr">136, 138, 140, 144, 148, 207 °C and</ref> for the two doped samples: 122, 126, 130, 134 138 and 207°C. 3LiAlD 4 →Li 3 AlD 6 + 2Al +D 2.</p><p>(1) Li 3 AlD6 →3LiD + Al +3/2D 2.</p><p>(2)</p><p>Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the results obtained for the decomposition of pure and doped Li 3 AlD 6 with VCl 3 at 207°C. The figure shows the integrated intensities of the measured diffractograms plotted as a function of 2θ and scan number. The total decomposition of the hexahydride is completed, after 72 min. and 24 min for the pure and doped sample, respectively. The efficiency of the VCl 3 to promote the second step reaction is then clearly shown. For the doped sample a new phase is coming up after the completion of the reaction. This phase has never been observed and is certainly due to the presence of the V phase in the sample. It has to be identified. For the measurements made at lower temperatures no clear trend can be observed directly from the Fid2D integrated plots. Thus, further analyses in term of phase composition using Rietveld refinements have to be done to get clear insight and quantitative data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) Decomposition of KAlD 4</head><p>The decomposition of KAlD 4 has been previously studied with a constant heating rate of 2°K/min. The decomposition follow the two steps described in the following set of equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">3 KAlD 4 → K 3 AlD 6 + 2Al+3D 2 (3) K 3 AlD 6 → 3KD + Al+3/2D 2 (4)</formula><p>The obtained results were not clear. Both decompositions were found to be fast and a possible melting of KAlD 4 was suspected to occur during the first decomposition step. In this new set of experiments the decomposition was studied at lower heating rates: 1°K/min, with a starting temperature of 100 o C. From these data it is clear that no melting occurs. Isothermal measurements have also been performed. Analysis of the data is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>c) Decomposition of NaAlH 4 with 10% TiF 3 additive</head><p>The thermal decomposition of sodium alanate, NaAlH 4 added with 10 mol% TiF 3 , at constant heating rate of 1 o K/min has been measured. The starting temperature was 50 o C. As the other alanates, sodium alanate is supposed to decompose in a two steps reaction. On the following picture one can easily see that the decomposition does not follow this "simple route". At least five different composition can be seen. d) Decomposition of Mg(AlH 4 ) 2</p><p>The thermal decomposition of magnesium alanate, Mg(AlH 4 ) 2 , at constant heating rates of 2, 5 and 10 K/min has previously been investigated by our research group. Supplementary constant heating rate experiments, as well as five constant temperature decomposition experiments were performed on this occasion. Analysis of the data is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>e) Decomposition of BaMgNiD 4</head><p>The thermal decomposition of the complex deuteride BaMgNiD 4 was studied during heating at a constant heating rate of 1 K/min. Decomposition was only observed at temperatures &gt; ~300°C. Analysis of the data is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>f) Decomposition of TbNiAlD ~1.1</head><p>Thermal desorption measurements on TbNiAlD ~1.1 were performed with a constant heating rate of 0.5 K/min. Two phase transitions could be seen in the measured temperature region.</p><p>The first phase transition is thought to correspond to the transition from orthorhombic Amm2 to hexagonal P62m at a D content of ~0.67, whereas the second phase transition most likely is the transition from hexagonal P62m to hexagonal P62c at a D content of ~0.33 by comparison with literature data. Analysis of the data is in progress. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( a )</head><label>a</label><figDesc>Li 3 AlD 6 both pure and 2 samples with different VCl 3 and (Ti,Al)Cl 3 doping.
