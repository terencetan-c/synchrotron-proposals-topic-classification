<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>In situ synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) study was conducted on sodium and potassium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4 and KBF4) to elucidate structural changes across solid-solid phase transitions over multiple heating-cooling cycles. The phase transition temperatures from diffraction measurements are consistent with the differential scanning calorimetry data (~240 °C for NaBF4 and ~290 °C for KBF4). The crystal structure of the high-temperature (HT) NaBF4 phase has been determined from synchrotron PXRD data. The HT disordered phase of NaBF4 crystallizes in the hexagonal, space group P63/mmc (No. 194) with a = 4.98955(1)Å, c = 7.73498(3)Å, V = 166.768(1) Å 3 , and Z = 2 at 250 °C. Thermal expansion coefficients for both phases were determined from high precision lattice parameters at elevated tempeartures, as obtained from Rietveld refinement of PXRD data. Interestingly for the HT-phase of NaBF4, the structure (upon heating) contracts slightly in the ab plane but expands in the c direction such that overall thermal expansion is positive.</p><p>Variable Temperature Powder x-ray diffraction measurements. The samples were contained in 1 mm diameter thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries that were spun at 919 rpm on the axis of the high resolution powder diffractometer at beamline ID22 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The X-ray wavelength was calibrated as 0.354331(7) A (35 keV) via NIST standard 640c Si powder. Diffraction patterns were collected in continuous-scanning mode using the 13-channel Si 111 multianalyser stage at 10 or 20 degrees per minute and recording data every 3 ms or 1.5 ms, respectively. Data were corrected for the effects of axial divergence and the 13 channels were combined and rebinned into steps of 0.0007 degrees. Heating was via a hot-air blower. and rebinned into steps of 0.0007 degrees.</p><p>Rietveld analysis Rietveld analysis of PXRD patterns was performed using the Topas Academic V7. Crystal structures of KBF4 and NaBF4 were refined using orthorhombic Pnma and Cmcm space groups, respectively. The scale factor, background parameters, instrumental zero-point, lattice parameters, peak profile parameters (a full Voigt function was used) were initially refined. To fit the highly anisotropic peak shapes Stephens hkl dependent peak shape model was used. In the final Rietveld refinements, all atom positions were reliably refined without restraints Neither set of data would give a stable refinement if the occupation factors and thermal parameters were simultaneously refined. The occupation factors for all the atoms were therefore constrained to achieve charge balance. Isotropic thermal parameters (Biso) for the individual atoms were refined for the ordered structures. However, for the HT disordered phases, Biso for individual atom types yielded high and unreliable values; and therefore, an overall common Biso for all the atoms were set and refined. Thermal expansion coefficients were calculated using the PASCAL program.</p></div>
