We were scheduled in December 2018 (07/12 -10/12). Our local contact was Gregory Effantin. Two users from my team (Maria Takacs, a research technician, and Michael Webster, a postdoc) traveled to the ESRF. We brought several grids from a batch, which was pre-screened locally on our Polara microscope. Thanks to the outstanding support by our local contact Maria and Michael were able to identify a good grid very quickly, select enough squares and holes and collect data that gave us about 5200 images. This was the fourth time we came to the ESRF but we have never started data collection as early as this time (around 3pm in the afternoon).</p><p>We had collected on RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation complex before at the ESRF (February 2018, July 2018, and November 2018) and in each case obtained high-quality data. We have recently submitted a paper, which is curently under review and contains reconstructions obtained from ESRF data. This is to say that we were extremely pleased with te quality of the data we have received so far and were looking forward to the results from this trip. Maria and Michael had already spent some time on optimizing complex formation and grid-freezing protocols. We brought several grids frozen under different conditions and Gregory Effantin, our local contact, helped us screen those grids and select a suitable one for data collection. He selected all the holes for data acquisition and everything went extremely smoothly.</p><p>We collected in total 5220 micrographs and have picked more than 600.000 particles. We were very excited because initial CTF estimations suggested that 80% of the micrographs contained information to a spatial resolution corresponding to 2.3Å or better and only a very small proportion of micrographs were worse than 4.5Å. I would like to stress that this complex is very challenging because we have compositional and conformational heterogeneity, which we cannot control biochemically. Processing and refining is therefore a time consuming task and we are far from being finished. After 2D classification and clean-up, Michael started to process the data using downscaled particles corresponding to a pixel-size of 4.4Å. He obtained initial 3D reconstructions and was able to classify the particles based on whether or not density for RNAP was present. The reconstructions refined to the theoretical limit of 8.8Å. Michael now uses the classified and re-extracted particles (1x binned, 2.2Å pixel size) and refined them to 4.4Å resolution (again, the theoretical limit). He is able to control for conformational heterogeneity using novel software tools (Relion 3) and his results are already much better than anything that has been published before. We are confident that this dataset will be an important step forward in our efforts to obtain a high-resolution reconstruction of a transcribing/translating RNAP-70S ribosome complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Preliminary reconstructions</head><p>Using downscaled particles, we have obtained reconstructions that refine to the theoretical resolution limit (left). At lower contour level (right), density for an RNAP tethered to the ribosome becomes visible. Focused refinement as well as multi-body refinement allowed us to confirm that this density is indeed RNAP, which is bound to the ribosome but rotates relative to the small ribosomal subunit.</p></div>		</body>
