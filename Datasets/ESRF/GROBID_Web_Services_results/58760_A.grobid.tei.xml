<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We report a series of measurements on a 0.5 mg sample of <ref type="bibr">248</ref> Cm metal. SQUID measurements (at ITU) show it is magnetic with an AF transition at ~ 65 K, in agreement with earlier reports on dhcp Cm. XMCD measurements at the M 4,5 absorption edges (at ID12) show that the element has an orbital moment of ~ 6% of the spin moment, and the two are parallel. This confirms the predictions of intermediate coupling, which has already been suggested for Cm by other spectroscopies. During these measurements we have found that the application of a 17 T field at 2 K changes the nature of the susceptibility, which initially shows AF correlations developing around 65 K. The application of this high field results in an induced ferromagnetic state.</p><p>The challenge at XMaS was in trying to determine if either a portion of the sample was single-crystal in nature, or whether the polycrystalline nature of the sample could be detected. The initial difficulty was in locating the small sample. This was done by having the sample glued to a Si(111) wafer. By rastering the sample over a 1 x 1 cm area with the diffracting beam at the Si(444) Bragg reflection, we were able to locate the sample (of 1 x 0.8 mm 2 ) by the absorption of the beam by the curium over this area. This was successful.</p><p>Diffraction experiments were unable to determine the crystallinity of the sample -as shown by the diffractogram (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) -suggesting that the sample may be partly amorphous due to its preparation by splat cooling. The H=0 ground-state antiferromagnetic structure remains unresolved.</p><p>Many other efforts were made to detect Bragg scattering from the sample, but were unsuccessful. The Be reflections in the above pattern are double because the walls of the cryostat are made from Be as well as the cover over the sample. The reflections from the walls of the cryostat are displaced in 2θ.</p><p>We can make a rough estimate of whether we should be sensitive to diffraction lines from polycrystalline Cm, based on the intensity from the 100 μm of Be covering the sample. At this energy (~ 13 keV) the Be (ρ = 1.85 mg/mm 3 ) is transparent to such X-rays, so the overall scattering mass from a volume of 0.1 mm thickness and a 1 x 1 mm 2 beam is 185 μg. For the Cm sample (ρ = 13.5 mg/mm 3 ) we take a penetration depth of 3 μm and a 1 x 1 mm 2 cross section to get a scattering mass of 40 μg. The effective scattering power (at Q = 4 Å -1 for example, here 2θ = 35 0 ) is proportional to the relevant scattering powers (squared) at this value of Q, which is ~ (70/1.65) 2 , giving a factor of ~ 1800. The final result is a factor of ~ 10 in favor of Cm at Q = 4 Å -1 , so the scattering from Cm should be readily observed, and be about 10 times as great as that from Be, if the sample is polycrystalline.</p><p>Efforts are now underway to see whether the sample can be annealed to induce crystallinity. Turning this sample into a powder is not an option, as it is very rare, and in powder form there is the risk of losing some sample.</p><p>The ITU staff would like to thank Simon Brown and Didier Wermeille for their heroic efforts in trying to find reflections and determine the nature of the Cm sample in this experiment! Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> A diffractogram taken at T = 300K with E = 12.966 keV (λ = 0.9562 Å). Impurities lines from the Be (on top of the sample and in the cryostat) and Al (from the sample holder) may be readily identified, but no clear indication of polycrystalline Cm. Scan taken on the XMaS diffractometer at the ESRF.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,48.84,85.68,312.00,231.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
