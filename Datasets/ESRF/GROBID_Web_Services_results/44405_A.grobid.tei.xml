<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this project was the in situ investigation of dynamic processes in vimentin intermediate filament self-assembly. Vimentin is a cytoskeletal protein which forms filaments, bundles and networks. These networks contribute greatly to the mechanical and biochemical properties of eukaryotic cells and a detailed knowledge of the assembly mechanism is desirable. In the past, mainly static measurements (using, e.g., electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy) have been performed, revealing snap shots of the assembly intermediates at different stages of the reaction. By performing small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements of the assembly process within continuous flow microfluidic devices, we overcame this limitation and obtained dynamic data.  A special microfluidic flow chamber was developed in which vimentin protein solution (~3 -4 mg/mL) is hydrodynamically focussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> by buffer streams from the side containing a high salt concentration. The increase in salt concentration initiates vimentin assembly. The 3D flow chamber (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) is fabricated in a way that the vimentin stream never touches the channel walls (see simulation of upper half of the channel in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>, high protein concentration is encoded in red, low concentration is encoded in blue) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Furthermore, we used UV curable adhesive, which shows a very low SAXS signal itsself and is at the same time moldable at high resolution (see photograph in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). We used a channel width of ~300 µm and the resulting protein stream was about 100 µm wide. By contrast the beam at ID02 was one order of magnitude larger in each directions (50 x 50 µm 2 ) and thus on the same order of magnitude as the protein stream in the flow device. The advantage of this beamline is the extended q-range (0.03 ... 2 nm -1 ) as compard to ID13 (0.3 … 1 nm -1 ). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref> show that taken together the data will provide a complete picture of the dynamic assembly process. The ID02 data (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>) cover a large q-range and show emerging features in the SAXS signal during the assembly process. Clearly the assembly kinetics can be followed in situ using this method. A complete analysis and interpretation of our ID02 data is currently not yet possible for a technical reason: During our measurements at ID02 accidentally a q-dependent factor had been applied to our raw data. This mistake was only discovered after the beam time and the recovery of the original data by the beam line staff is still in progress. The ID13 data of a very similar experiment (flow rates and exact channel positions vary slightly) are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>. In the overlapping q-range the data are consistent and ID13 offers the additional possibility to analyze data points from more (and more closely spaced) positions in the channel (data not shown).</p><p>In addition to the assembly process of vimentin, which was initiated by the inflow of salt buffer, we were able to test the additional inflow of divalent ions, in this case magnesium ions (Mg 2+ ). This inflow was located at a position further downstream in the channel. A device similar to the one shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> was used, but with additional side inlets (see sketch in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). This experiment goes beyond what was proposed for this beamtime and was a first test of the effect of multivalent ions on the SAXS signal of intermediate filament protein. The promising results convinced us to continue these studies in the future. Again, the overlapping q-range shows agreement between the measurements at ID02 and ID13 further validating the method and the setup. Further data analysis and interpretation is necessary and will be performed as soon as we can work with the original data for our measurements at ID02.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Sarah KOESTER*, Martha BRENNICH*, Sarah SCHWARZ G.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Micro-focused SAXS in combination with microfluidics is a high-resolution technique in two respects. First of all, a microfocused beam with a diameter smaller than the channel dimensions provides a high spatial resolution. The device is "scanned" through the beam and data from different positions are obtained. Secondly, x-ray scattering itself provides high resolution in q-space. We used two different beamlines in our experiments, which are complementary concerning the resolution properties. The microbeam at ID13 was focused to a very small spot size (5 x 5 µm²) and thus provided a lateral resolution of 5 µm. Additionally the in-line microscope provided the possibility to exaclty determine where in the flow chamber the measurements were performed. The lateral spatial resolution in a laminar flow mixer as used in our experiments corresponds directly to the time resolution of the experiment. The laminar flow allowed us to use long exposure times (0.8 to 5 s) while fresh material was streaming through the beam. We could thus resolve the reaction kinetic on the second time scale. Since there are no tubulences in the steady state flow, the reaction conditions, local concentrations etc. do not vary over time and data taken from one spot represent an esemble average.</p></note>
