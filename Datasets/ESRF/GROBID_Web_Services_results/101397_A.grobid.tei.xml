<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Revealing crystal structure of novel high-pressure tungsten borides</p><p>Experiment number: HC-5074 Beamline: ID-27 Date of experiment: from: 15 November 2022 to: 18 November 2022 Date of report: 28.02.2023 Shifts: 9 Local contact(s): Mohamed Mezouar, Tomasz Poreba Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr Sergey Ovsyannikov* Bayerisches Geoinstitut, University of Bayreuth Dr. Elena Bykova* Bayerisches Geoinstitut, University of Bayreuth Report:</p><p>Inexpensive superhard materials find numerous industrial applications. Several theoretical and experimental studies suggest that mechanical characteristics of some tungsten borides could exceed those of widely used tungsten carbide, WC. Nevertheless, there are still many inconsistencies on possible crystal structures, chemical compositions, stability fields, and mechanical properties of tungsten borides. The aim of the proposed experiment was to apply methods of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) in laser-heated DACs in order to determine crystal structures and chemical compositions of possible high-pressure phase(s) in W-B system.</p><p>A mixture of boron and tungsten were loaded into a DAC equipped with 120 um Boehler-Almax diamonds; neon was used as a pressure medium and as a pressure standard. The sample was laser-heated at 95 GPa to a maximum 3000(100) K. We observed formation of at least two novel tungsten boride phases: a high-pressure polymorph of tungsten tetraboride, HP-WB4, that crystallizes in sp.gr. C2/m (Z = 2, a = 2.8651( <ref type="formula">18</ref>), b = 4.8677(9), c = 4.6863(17) Å, β = 97.42(5)°, R1 = 6.3%) and tungsten hexaboride, WB6, with sp.gr. I2/m (Z = 2, a = 7.3256( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), b = 2.7508(2), c = 8.8094(7) Å, β = 103.034( <ref type="formula">14</ref>)° , R1 = 3.3%). Crystal structure of HP-WB4, is similar to one of LP-WB4. In the crystal structure of LP-WB4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, left), the metal atoms form the flat hexagonal close packed layers perpendicular to c-axis that follow ABABA… sequence. Covalently-bonded boron networks are located between layers of tungsten atoms. The networks consist of two puckered layers connected through short B-B bonds. In the crystal structure of high-pressure polymorph the boron layers flatten, while tungsten layers have no translational shift i.e. follow simple AAA… sequence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, center). Due to higher metal:boron ratio, the crystal structure of WB6 appears to be more complex and consists from WB14 polyhedra connected through common edges and faces (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, right). It resembles motifs found in other highpressure transitional metal borides composed of MBx polyhedra such as FeB4, Fe2B7 and Co5B16. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
