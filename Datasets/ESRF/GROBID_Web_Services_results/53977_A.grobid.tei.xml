<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Local probing of the structural properties in the working OFET devices</p><p>Experiment number: SC 3830 Beamline: ID 13 Date of experiment: from: 16 July 2014 to: 21 July 2014 Date of report: 27 February 2015 Shifts: 15 Local contact(s): Manfred Burghammer, Thomas Dane Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Souren Grigorian* Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Ullrich Pietsch, Linda Grodd* Eduard Mikayelyan* Department of Physics University of Siegen Germany Report:</p><p>We studied real size functioning thiophene based organic field effect transistors (OFET) by nanobeam grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (nanoGIXD). The pronounced changes of the conductive polymer channel and, in particular, at the polymer/gold electrode interfaces as a function of applied voltage have been found. A manuscript for publication of the results is currently in preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimentals:</head><p>Poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT/ chloroform solution (2 mg/ml) was drop cast onto thermally oxidized silicon substrates with interdigitated gold electrodes (Fraunhofer-Institut für Photonische Mikrosysteme, Dresden, Germany).</p><p>The studied channel lengths were in the range of 10 µm to 20 µm, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. The samples were scanned through the nanobeam (&lt; 200 nm in size, energy 14.9 keV) for spatially resolved examination of the active polymer channels and polymer/gold electrode interfaces undervoltages in the range of 0 V to 100 V which were applies using a Keithley 2612A sourcemeter. Diffraction images were captures with a FReLoN detector. Exposure times were kept short (≤ 1 s) to avoid radiation damage.</p><p>300 µm commercially available OFET substrates with 10 µm channel length The grazing incidence geometry allowed for a spatial resolution of approx. 200 nm in the vertical and 43 µm in the horizontal direction (beam footprint on sample). In case of top-contact geometry, it is well known that gold can diffuse into the polymer layer especially when thermally treated. In our experiment we used OFETs with a bottom-contact geometry to avoid this problem. The spatially resolved nanoGIXD mappings of the pristine OFET device show little variation of the diffraction patterns within the polymer channel regions and electrode regions, respectively, with well defined borders. Application of a source drain voltage V SD leads to irreversible changes as shown by the nanoGIXD mappings that were done at V SD = 10 V, 50 V and 100 V with stronger variations and less defined borders. Interestingly, some diffraction patterns contained contributions from gold amidst the polymer channel. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows a strong change of initial diffraction pattern under applied voltage.</p></div>
