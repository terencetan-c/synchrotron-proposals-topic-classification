<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to study naturally occurring irregular zones in plant cell walls, so-called dislocations, especially to study their crystalline characteristics in the unloaded, humidified state, and during tensing (also in a humid state). The hypothesis is that in the wet state and at moderate stress levels, dislocations dissipate stresses rather than function as failure initiation points and thus are useful to the plant in maintaining cell wall integrity during the life span of the plant. The first step in testing this hypothesis is to study the structure of dislocations, specifically whether their structure differs from the surrounding cell wall and whether structural changes are induced by tensile stresses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Initial tests</head><p>The experiment was carried out using hemp fibres (Cannabis sativa (L.)) as model plant fibres. These fibres are comparably long (5-10 mm and 10-30 µm in diameter), which facilitates handling. In addition, earlier studies focusing on dislocations carried out by the participants have been performed on hemp fibres. Before the start of the beam time we performed off-line tests on fibres with the tensile testing setup provided by ID13to get used to the setup, to confirm earlier tensile test results and especially to assemble the humidity cell around the samples and to monitor the achieved relative humidity. The stipulated 80% relative humidity were reached at room temperature, but later when mounting the assembly at the beamline, we observed that the temperature in the hutch was higher (~25 ˚C) and that the maximum relative humidity achievable was 73%. Consequently, experiments were carried out at this humidity level. In additional off-line tests fibres were strained under a light microscope with crossed polars in the user laboratory. These tests confirmed that dislocations gradually became less visible during straining in tension, and that they were no longer discernable at a force level of approximately 400 mN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data capture</head><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives an overview of the data successfully captured, i.e. unsuccessful attempts are not shown. Since the light microscope at the beamline could not be used simultaneously with the tensile stage and the humidity cell, the original plan of performing line scans across a dislocation was deemed unviable, as the exact location of the dislocations was impossible to confirm once the fibre had been mounted. Instead mesh scans were performed. To avoid radiation damage influencing the second and later mesh scans captured for a given fibre, great care was taken not to re-measure any region. Due to the tensile strain and the lack of a microscope, this was not trivial. Two different approaches were used: Displacement in the longitudinal direction of the fibre, and displacement in the transversal direction of the fibre.</p><p>In the first case the mesh position was moved in the opposite direction of the strain-induced movement of the fibre. For this approach fibres were chosen which were either filled with dislocations or nearly without dislocations. The rationale behind this choice was that different positions would not be too different from each other, and that any differences between meshes would be predominantly due to differences in tensile stress. In order to try to catch data from the exact same dislocation before and after tensing, an alternative transversal displacement approach was also attempted. For these fibres a distinct dislocation surrounded by normal cell wall was chosen, and the upper and lower half of the fibre was mesh-scanned before respectively after tensing, extending the lower mesh to compensate for the strain. Up till now it had been found that at ID13, fibres failed at much lower force levels than experienced in earlier tensile tests. ESRF staff confirmed that fibres could behave differently when tested in the line, and that X-ray radiation most likely damaged the fibres. Therefore modest tensile force levels were chosen. However, tensing these fibres to failure after the second mesh had been collected revealed that they were much stronger than the fibres tested previously, and the supposed 'after tensing' mesh scan therefore does not represent a state where the dislocations are no longer visible using polarized light. Unfortunately, when this was realised our beam time was over.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Overview of successful measurements obtained at ID13 on hemp fibres during the allocated beamtime.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a colour coded image of one of the 24×63=1512 X-ray diffraction patters in the mesh scan obtained from sample A74 before tensing. The parameters to be compared between dislocations and normal cell wall, as well as between different tensing levels include: 1) the intensity of the 200 signals, 2) the angle compared to horizontal of a line connecting the two 200 signals, and 3) the length or angle between the upper and lower edges of the 200 signals. Analysis of these parameters will help clarify possible differences in crystallinity and microfibril angle between dislocations and the surrounding cell wall and how these characteristics differ between the tensed and the un-tensed state.</p></div>
