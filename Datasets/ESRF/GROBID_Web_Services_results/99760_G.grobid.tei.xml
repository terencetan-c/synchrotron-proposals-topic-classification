<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Preliminary results</head><p>We have conducted scanning µXRD at ID13 and scanning µXRF at ID21. The preliminary results are extreme informative. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we have performed µXRD and µXRF on a section of Dentate Gyrus of a subject diagnosed with Pick's disease. These data provided significant information on the distribution of fibrillar polymorphs among different plaques and tangles. The fibrils within Amyloid plaques and NFT is composed of β-sheets structures having a periodicity of 4.7 Å along longitudinal direction. µXRD exhibited patterns correlated to this featured structure, which allowed us determine the distribution of plaques and tangles. Furthermore, µXRD exhibited distinct patterns (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) correlated to the novel structures, having periodicity of 5.2 Å, for the plaques and NFTs. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> showed the significant difference between the distribution of the map of 4.7 Å and the map of 5.2 Å. µXRF provided high resolution map of different element distribution, especially light element like Phosphate and Calcium, which has been thought great impacting the formation of plaques and tangles. The µXRF results were well correlated to µXRD results.(Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) The preliminary results indicate that the abnormal accumulation of Calcium and phosphate could give rise to a novel structure other than β-sheet structure for Amyloid plaques and neurofibrils tangles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Improvement on samples preparation and experiment setup</head><p>Due to limited beamtime and initial issues with tissue flatness, we have not yet been able to measure tissue sections from all relevant brain regions for subjects with a full range of disease stages. However, we have developed a protocol for mounting tissue samples flat on Si3N4 membranes that has greatly enhanced data quality. Thus, to complete our characterization of the pathological pathway of Tau pathology, we propose to measure six brain regions from three patients at different stages of disease by µXRD at ID13 and µXRF at ID21. We will track -as a function of disease stage -the distribution of polymorphs and abnormal elemental distribution within the six brain regions most severely impacted by disease. These observations should reveal clues as to the molecular mechanism of disease progression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific expectation</head><p>The preliminery results are very interesting and encouraging. Combation of µXRD and µXRF could resolve the molecular structural variation directly from tissues. With the improvement of sample preparation and sufficient beam, we should be able to measure the tissue samples from different regions of pathological pathway of neurodisease. Thus, we propose to apply for the additional beamtime, that will provide the missing structural infromation between synthesized plaques firbils and real fibrils deposited within tissues. We highly appreicate the support from the local contact from ID13 and ID21. Their supporting and suggestions are essential for the successful experiment.</p><p>Figure 1. Combining scanning XRD and scanning XRF are could reveal unprecedent information within tissue samples. From a. we could find that XRD pattern from different region of tissues shows different patterns. (top-left, 1D intensity profiles shown weak 4.7 Å and 5.2 Å structural pattern; bottomleft shown 1D intensity containing signficant 5.2 Åpattern; center is the integral intensity map of 4.7 Å pattern; top-right is 1D intensity profile containing both 4.7 Å and 5.2 Å structural pattern; bottom-right is 1D intensity profile from tissue region with plaques and tangles.) b. the distribution of the XRD patterns shows clearly morphological distribution. (Left is the opitical microscope image shows the tissue and roi for µXRD; top-right is the map of 5.2 Å pattern, center-right is the map of 4.7 Å pattern; bottomright is the map of 4.12 Å pattern.) c. correlating XRF and XRD, the element distributions, such Zn, Ca and P, are well correlated to the morphological features in the map of 5.2 Å patterns (90 rotated red box in the map of 5.2 Å patterns).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
