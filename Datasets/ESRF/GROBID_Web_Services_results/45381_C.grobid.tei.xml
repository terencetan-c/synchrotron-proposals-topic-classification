<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Aim</head><p>Understanding gold (Au) biomineralisation in metallophillic bacteria such as C. metallidurans will allow us to use these organisms for the production of gold nano-particles, as bioprocessing tools and as whole cell biosensors in gold exploration. While Au(III)-complexes are easy to work with (esp. with respect µXRF-and µXANES method development in 3 previous experiments) and occur in highly oxidising chloride rich environments, our recent research suggests that Au(I)-complexes such as Au(I)-thiosulfate and Au(I)-cyanide are the most likely to occur complexes in surface soil environments [4]; in addition cyanidation of Au is the most common process used in Au ore processing [1].</p><p>In recent experiments we have shown that Au(I)-complexes are readily accumulated by C. metallidurans cells and the apparent formation of nano-particulate Au was observed in Au(I)-thiosulfate amended cells but not in cells amended with Au(I)-cyanide, yet the mechanisms are not understood [5]. Thus before we use this organism for any type of biotechnological application such as biosorption for ore processing or nano-particle formation, we need to understand the Au accumulation process including the formation of the Au(I)-complexes . Preliminary data on Pt uptake in cells were also measured.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General observations (ligand, time, medium)</head><p>Au-CN: Unsurprisingly these spectra resemble the non-bacterial Au-CN standard collected previously. There is a slight decrease of the pre-edge, which occurred for (i) samples that had longer incubation times (18 days), and (ii) those cells that were inactive or dead. For the kinetic series, the 24 hour sample (Au-CN 3-16) resembled that of Au-23118 (6 days); the Au concentrations in the other samples were low and the spectra very noisy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Au-thiomalate:</head><p>The kinetic data showed some Au up-take, but the concentrations were low and the spectra very noisy. However, the spectra had a small edge peak, indicating that the Au was not metallic (sample 2-16 can be described by a linear combination of 67% Au-CN + 33% metallic Au; spectrum 2-14 is similar to 2-16). For the other series, again the samples with the longer incubation time (18 days) had a smaller pre-edge. However this time the dead and inactive cells had a higher pre-edge than the live cells (all 6 days). Au-S 2 O 3 : The kinetic data showed a decrease in the pre-edge peak with increasing incubation time. The pre-edge in the 6 day data was the same for the inactive and dead cells (21218 &amp; 21318), and was higher than that for the live cells (21118). The 18 day data (11129) was similar to the 6-day data for inactive or dead cells. Pt-cisplatin: There is little variation in these spectra. There is a small increase in the white line with increasing incubation time for the kinetic series, but such small changes could be experimental artefacts. The spectra for the other series are almost identical. Pt-Cl: The kinetic series spectra were identical. The spectra for the other series are similar -there is a small decrease in the white line with increasing incubation time (6 to 18 days). 1. It should be noted that some of the variation noted in the spectra could also be artefacts due to noisy spectra induced by low elemental concentrations. This needs to be explored further. 2. It is interesting that while the Au-CN and Au-thiomalate spectra could be well matched by using a linear combination of the Au-CN and metallic Au standard spectra, a third standard was required to get a good match for the Au-thiosulfate spectra.</p></div>
