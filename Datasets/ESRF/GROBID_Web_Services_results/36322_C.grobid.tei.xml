<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cortical bone from human radius and pleistocene hominoid have been analyzed to characterize quantitatively the bone structure at the fibre composite. The complete orientation distribution of mineral components (apatite) have been measured by quantitative texture analysis with synchrotron X-rays. However due to the hierarchical organization of bone tissue structural characterization below osteon scale need to be done with microbeam set-up. At this level the quantitative knowledge of the orientation distribution of mineral particles are very limited. Diffraction experiments were carried out at ID13 Beam line (ESRF) in order to analyze not only apatite texture at very low scale (lamella) but also to establish a procedure to extract in situ macromolecule orientation information (collagen) with a combined SAXS-WAXS setup. Analyses were done at λ~ 0.9919 Å (E: 12.51keV) and focused to 1 μm. Detail information about nanostructure is crucial to detect evolutionary trends in organic tissues as well as to know bone behavior.</p></div>
