<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This is a preliminary report on the status of proposal HE1093. The proposal aims at looking at the orbital ordering in perovskite manganites using soft x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (SXRMS) and angledependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The experiments are to be conducted in a purpose built uhvdiffractometer. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the assembly of the uhv-compatible goniometer at the manufacturer's factory. The manufacturers (RMP) are currently completing the first test phase of the goniometer and the ESRF envisages fully testing the goniometer at the manufacturer's premises in the next two weeks. Unfortunately, the diffractometer is in delay which means that HE1093 has been postphoned until the middle of June. The delay arises from the fact that in the initial design phase RMP wanted to use piezoelectric motors for the motions, but after several weeks of testing these were found to be incompatible with the specifications document which I supplied. The adjustements to the mechanics in order to realise a small sphere of confusion are also taking longer than expected since the goniometer has to assembled and disassembled each time an adjustment has to be made. This is mainly due to the damage done to the differentially pumped seals if the adjustments are made without disassembling the goniometer. RMP have now added more technicians to the project and are confident that we will be able to begin factory tests in May. All other components of the uhvdiffractometer have been delivered on site. I hope to provide a more detailed scientific report in the near future.</p><p>In terms of the next scheduling round the uhv-diffractometer will almost certainly be ready for any SXRMS user proposals that may be accepted in the current round. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows that the goniometer is assembled and that fine tuning of the mechanics is all that is required now. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 uhv goniometer undergoing first phase tests at the RMP factory.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,35.24,68.08,512.04,384.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
