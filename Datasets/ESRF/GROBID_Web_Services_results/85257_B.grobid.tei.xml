Furthermore, the influence of the ionic strength was 13 examined by different background electrolytes. For low ionic strength (I = 0.3 M) artificial cement 14 pore water (ACW, pH = 13) and for high ionic strength (I = 2.5 M) cement pore water based on the 15 diluted caprock solution (ACW-VGL, pH = 12.5) were used. Sorption experiments were performed 16 under Ar atmosphere using HCP in the binary system HCP / GLU ([GLU]0 1×10 -1 -1×10 -8 M) and 17 the ternary system HCP / Pu(IV) / GLU ([ 239 Pu(IV)]0 = 1×10 -8 M, [GLU]0 = 1×10 -2 M) with solid-to-18 liquid ratios (S/L) of 0.1 -50 g L -1 within a contact time of 72 h. GLU sorbs strongly on HCP; a 19 saturation of the sorption sites of HCP with GLU was observed at [GLU] ≥ 1×10 -4 M at S/L = 5 g L -1 . 20</p><p>The effects of the order of addition of the components Pu(IV) and GLU showed a low sorption of 21 Pu(IV) to HCP. In the absence of GLU, quantitative uptake (S% = 99%) of Pu(IV) by HCP was 22 observed. GLU had a significant effect on the sorption of Pu(IV) to HCP independent of the ionic 23 strength of both background electrolytes. 24</p><p>For XAFS measurements powder samples with Pu ([Pu(III)]0 = 5×10 -6 M) sorbed on HCP (S/L = 2.5 25 g L -1 ) were prepared in ACW and ACW-VGL, respectively, at pH ≈ 13. With ACW-VGL as 26 electrolyte, one additional sample was prepared in the presence of GLU ([GLU]0 = 1×10</p><p>-2 M) for 27 comparison. Pu LIII-edge XANES spectra indicated that after uptake by HCP Pu is in the tetravalent 28 oxidation state. The EXAFS structural parameters and comparison with literature indicate 29 incorporation of Pu(IV) into calcium-silicate-hydrates phases of HCP. The different ionic strengths 30 and the presence of GLU had no influence on the near-neighbor environment of Pu in HCP. 31 1 Introduction 32 In nuclear waste management, the assessment of environmental issues regarding the long-term 33 disposal of radioactive waste is essential. Cement will be used as part of the technical barrier in a 34 deep geological nuclear waste repository. It is used not only as a building material, but also as a 35 technical barrier (Duro <ref type="bibr">et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tyupina et al., 2023)</ref>. In this context, hydrated cement phases 36 buffer the pH value and thus three main states of cement degradation are described by the interaction 37 with inflowing groundwater. In the first state, the cement pore water evolves from a solution 38 dominated by NaOH and KOH ([Na] ≈ 0.1 M, [K] ≈ 0.2 M, pH ≈ 13.3) to a solution saturated with</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(HCP), prepared from ordinary Portland cement, was investigated by batch 9 experiments in diluted caprock solution (I = 2.5 M) as a function of solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratio (0.5-10 20.0 g L -1 ) and pH (9-13). Independent of the oxidation state of the actinides, strong sorption was 11 observed with Rd values between 10 3 -10 7 L kg -1 . For the hexavalent actinides U(VI) and Np(VI), a 12 decrease in sorption was observed with increasing pH values, which could be due to the formation 13 of the AnO2(OH)4 2-species. CE-ICP-MS measurements of the supernatant solution from the U(VI) 14 batch sorption experiment at pH &gt; 9 show that UO2(OH)3 -and UO2(OH)4 2-dominate the speziation. 15 Pu LIII-edge XANES and EXAFS measurements showed oxidation of Pu(III) to Pu(IV) when inter-16 acting with HCP. Calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) phases effectively immobilize Pu(IV) by incor-17 porating it into the CaO layer. This was observed in a C-S-H sample with C/S = 1.8 and HCP at pH 18 12.7. A comparison with data published in the literature on the retention of actinides on cement at 19 low ionic strength showed that the influence of high ionic strength (I = 2.5) on the sorption behaviour 20 was insignigicant.</figDesc></figure>

In Germany, possible host 26 rocks for such a repository are clay rock, salt rock or granite as natural barriers. Suitable 27 clay formations can be found, for example, in Northern Germany, a region with pore and 28 formation waters of medium and high ionic strength. [1,2], which is well above 1 M and 29 even up to 4 M at appropriate depths [3]. These values are significantly higher than in 30 other clay formations (e.g., Switzerland, France, Belgium) considered as host rocks for 31 nuclear waste repositories . In addition to the natural barrier of the host rock, the technical 32 components of the repository also have an influence on the confinement of the emplaced 33 radiotoxic waste. Cementitious materials are used widely as construction materials and 34 engineered barriers in high-level waste (HLW) repositories and posses a high capacity for 35 actinide retention [4-6]. Hydrated cement consists of different phases such as portlandite, 36 calcium aluminate/ferrite phases and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) phases, the latter 37 having a mass fraction of 50-70% [4,7]. These phases can retard actinides due to their large 38 surface area, microcrystalline structure with defect sites and the presence of binding sites. 39 The actinides can be adsorbed on the surface or incorporated into their structure, where 40 the C-S-H phases play an important part in the sorption process of actinides (or radionu-</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This submission has been reviewed and requires minor revision.  The retention of actinides in different oxidation states (An(X), X = III, IV, VI) by a calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) phase with a Ca/Si (C/S) ratio of 0.8 was investigated in the presence of gluconate (GLU). The actinides considered were Am(III), Th(IV), Pu(IV), and U(VI). Eu(III) was investigated as chemical analogue for Am(III) and Cm(III). In addition to the ternary systems An(X)/GLU/ C-S-H, also binary systems An(X)/C-S-H, GLU/C-S-H, and An(X)/GLU were studied. Complementary analytical techniques were applied to address the different specific aspects of the binary and ternary systems. Time-resolved laser-induced luminescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) was applied in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to identify retained species and to monitor species-selective sorption kinetics. 13 C and 29 Si magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to determine the bulk structure and the composition of the C-S-H surface, respectively, in the absence and presence of GLU. The interaction of Th(IV) with GLU in different electrolytes was studied by capillary electrophoresis-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (CE-ICP-MS). The influence of GLU on An(X) retention was investigated for a large concentration range up to 10 -2 M. The results showed that GLU had little to no effect on the overall An(X) retention by C-S-H with C/S of 0.8, regardless of the oxidation state of the actinides. For Eu(III), the TRLFS investigations additionally implied the formation of a Eu(III)-bearing precipitate with dissolved constituents of the C-S-H phase, which becomes structurally altered by the presence of GLU. For U(VI) sorption on the C-S-H phase, only a small influence of GLU could be established in the luminescence spectroscopic investigations, and no precipitation of U(VI)-containing secondary phases could be identified.
