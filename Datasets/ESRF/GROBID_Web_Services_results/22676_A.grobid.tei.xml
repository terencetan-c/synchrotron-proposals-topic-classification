<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Previous to this experiment we have demonstrated, that a one dimensional focusing of hard x-rays using linear silicon fresnel zone plates (FZPs) can be achieved <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. By using a tilted arrangement of the FZP, the effective height of the diffractive structures can be increased by a significant factor (10 or more) to match the optimum phase for a given photon energy (see <ref type="bibr">Fig 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">left)</ref>. For a binary FZP, the diffraction efficiency is limited to about 40% even for zone structures with negligible absorption. To obtain higher diffraction efficiencies, so-called blazed zone plates with asymmetric zone structures are needed. Di Fabrizio et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> were able to obtain more than 50% diffraction efficiency in the multi-keV region using electroplated Nickel zone plates with 4-level zone structures.</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to test linear Si zone plates with 4-level structures applying the above mentioned tilted arrangement to access a much higher energy range (10-15 keV) and to exceed the existing efficiency record. A SEM micrograph of such a lens is shown in  74 76 78 80 82 84 86 88 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 efficiency / [%] tilt angle/[°] diffraction efficiency of a zone plate at 10.0 keV 12.4 keV 15.0 keV 80 82 84 86 88 0 20 40 60 80 diffraction efficiency / [%] tilt angle/[°] diffraction efficiency of a grating zero order first order second order (A) (B) Fig. 2. (A) Measured diffraction efficiencies of different orders and theoretical results (solid lines) for a grating with 1 µm period and a height of 1.5 µm at 12.4 keV photon energy. (B) Measured diffraction efficiencies of a zone-plate for different tilt angles and energies.</p><p>We performed efficiency measurements of several 4-level diffraction gratings and FZPs. In case of the gratings it was possible to record the diffraction efficiency of several diffraction orders to be able to perform a Fourier analysis of the diffraction structures. Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref> shows, that the measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, which indicates the excellent structure quality. Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref> shows the measured diffraction efficiencies of a zone plate with 200 µm aperture, a focal length of 0.75 m (at 12.4 keV photon energy) and a minimal grating period of 800 nm. For optimum tilt angles efficiencies between 64% and 67% were obtained in the energy range from 10 to 15 keV. This is already very close to the theoretical limit and higher than any efficiency value reported so far for x-ray optics. Limited by the vertical source size of the dipole beam line, the spatial resolution of the lenses could not be tested. These results have been presented at the XRM2002 Conference in Grenoble <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the initially planned experiments, we were able to perform efficiency and resolution mesurements on planar refractive lenses etched 40 µm deep into CVD-diamond substrates (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). We obtained transmission values of up to 78% spot sizes of down to 3 µm and gains up to 17. This work is of special relevance for the planned X-FEL sources, a publication has been submitted to J. Syncrotron Rad. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Future work will focus on the implementation of blazed Fresnel lenses for coherence-matched 2dimensional micro-focusing. We gratefully acknowledge the excellent support of Joanna Hoszowska in this experiment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig 2, right.</figDesc></figure>
