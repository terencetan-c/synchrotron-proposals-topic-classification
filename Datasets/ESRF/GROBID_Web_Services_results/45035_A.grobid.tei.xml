Tensile tests have also been performed at room temperature on these grades. Data confirmed the existence of a TRIP effect which led to high uniform elongation and a depletion of volume fraction of austenite near the fracture. A load of 2 kN was sufficient to apply a stress of 150 MPa on a specimen with a section of 1 mm².</p><p>During the beam time we also encountered several problems with the plate detector. We have indeed observed intensity variation on the integrated diagrams made from the data acquired with the Pixium detector. This behavior has been observed on all series of tests and seems to only affect the 0.4 s exposure mode. After investigations on the beamline, the problem comes from a fast shutter with no reproducible movements. Moreover, we have encountered another issue with the detector after a crash of the server. The images displayed on the computer during the acquisition are observed with a shift of 5 images, which means that the image displayed was in fact an image acquired before.</p><p>From our tests some comments could pointed out concerning the ETMT device:</p><p> The ETMT device is very efficient to control thermomechanical cycles, although the temperature measured by the thermocouple has to be taken with care since it measures an additional tension from the thermocouple itself. We have observed a gap of ± 30°C from the real temperature at the range of austempering temperature we worked with.  The ETMT device is efficient to perform tensile tests, although the tensile specimens have to be design with the specificities of the ETMT device in mind (max load of 3 kN, and nonlinear response above 1.5 kN).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig. 2: C</figDesc></figure>
