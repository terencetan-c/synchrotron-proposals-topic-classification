<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Abstract:</head><p>Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are an emerging class of rechargeable electrochemical cells with applications in specialty electric vehicles, including aviation, and grid-scale energy storage. In-situ X-ray computed tomography and diffraction have provided a wealth of information on crystalline transformations during cell cycling, but are unable to probe the solution-based processes thought to be responsible for capacity fade. These conversions between lithium polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sn, where n = 2-8) underpin Li-S battery operation but are poorly understood. To date, these species have not been unambiguously observed by X-ray scattering techniques, obscuring their local structure and behaviour in situ. Progress has been inhibited by the lack of "standard" solutions and the typically low concentrations of these species present in in-situ cells. Recent work has established methods to produce concentrated solutions (&gt;1 M) with quantified compositions and phase diagrams in commercially-relevant electrolyte systems. We will build on these results to report the first X-ray pair-distribution-function (PDF) analysis of these species, shedding light on their structure, interactions with different electrolyte systems and paving the way to track these species in situ, enabling long-life Li-S batteries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Details:</head><p>All sample preparation were prepared at University College London (UCL). The desired stoichiometric amounts of dry S8 and Li2S powders were dissolved in various solvent systems (tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dioxolane (DOL):dimethoxyethane (DME), at 80 °C in sealed vials for 72 hours with constant stirring, to yield standard solutions of varying concentrations (10 M in terms of sulfur) of the desired Li2Sn (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). All handling took place under inert atmosphere in an Ar-filled glovebox, and glass capillaries were flame-sealed under Ar (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Four additional capillaries will contain only solvent mixtures, which were used for subtraction of the electrolyte and container contributions in differential PDF analysis. These samples were critical as the solvent and container comprise a large proportion of material in the X-ray beam and thus were significant in the raw scattering data collected. All scattering data was taken at room temperature. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the G(r) functions for the THF and DOL:DME solutions. As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, at least two distinct peaks can be identified from the scattering data of the Li2Sn solutions that are distinct from the neat solvent. The first of which, at ~2.1 Å, corresponds to the nearest neighbour (NN) S-S correlation from the dissolved Li2Sn species. This is followed by the next (NNN) S-S correlation at ~3.3 Å. The other two distinct peaks at ~1.7 and ~2.3 Å, present in both the solvent sample and Li2Sn solutions, are consistent with contributions from the C-C and C-O bond lengths of the solvent. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> we can see each of the functions overlayed and here it is observed that the solvent signatures (C-C and C-O) have a shift to smaller bond lengths in the Li2Sn solutions. This made the background subtraction of the solvent non-trivial as the shift in bond length suggests that the solvent molecules strongly interact with the Li2Sn species.</p><p>In terms of differentiating each chain length Li2Sn it is difficult to judge from these results whether X-ray scattering can reliably distinguish between the species. It is possible that the magnitude of the NN S-S correlation could be used as an indication of sulfur content. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> we can see that the longest chain length Li2Sn (Li2S8) has the highest intensity for this peak. This is understandable as this species has the highest sulfur loading. This trend continues in the other samples as the intensity of this peak decreases with decreasing chain length, until it disappears in the solvent sample. This correlation can also be observed in the NNN S-S peak, which shows a decrease in intensity for Li2S2 in comparison to Li2S4 and Li2S8. However, Li2S4 shows little difference in intensity for this peak compared to Li2S8, which is likely due to the disproportionation reactions that can occur in these solutions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>This work investigated the structures of the species by total X-ray scattering with PDF analysis, which revealed signatures of the dissolved species. Furthermore, the data highlighted the importance of the solvent interactions to understanding the structures of the Li2Sn species, which has inspired further neutron studies of the solvent sysmtes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Gavin Vaughan (vaughan@esrf.fr) Received at ESRF: 15 th October 2022 Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Alex Rettie (University College London) -a.rettie@ucl.ac.uk *Michael Johnson (University College London) -michael.johnson.19@ucl.ac.uk</figDesc></figure>
