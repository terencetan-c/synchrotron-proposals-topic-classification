GCM1 contains a 150 amino acid residues DNA-binding domain of unknown structure. We have crystallized GCM1 in complex with its target site in different crystal forms. The best crystals diffract to 2.8 Å resolution. In June 2000 an initial MIR elctron density was obtained using iodo-substituted oligonucleotides. This electron density allowed tracing of about 80% of the model. More recently on different brominederivatives helped to improve the experimental phases. At the same time we tried to extend the resolution of the native data. Furthermore data were collected from two other crystal forms with DNA and the quality of crystals without DNA were tested. At this stage refinement of the GCM/DNA complex at 2.8Å is almost completed.</p><p>Manuscript in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Outstation BAG (Protein-DNA group of Christoph Muller) a member of the IκB protein family. IκB proteins associate via their ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain with the transcription factor NF-κB. Bcl-3 is an unusual IκB protein because it is primarily nucleoplasmic and can associate with DNA-bound homodimers. Using data collected at ID14-1 we have solved the crystal structure of the ANK repeat domain of human Bcl-3 at 1.9 Å resolution. The structure contains 7 ankyrin repeats and it is the first structure of an IκB protein in its unbound form. The structure provides a basis for understanding the functional diversity of IκB proteins. Publication: Crystal structure of the ankyrin repeat domain of Bcl-3. F. Michel, M. Soler-Lopez, C. Petosa, P. Cramer, U. Siebenlist &amp; C.W. Müller (submitted).</figDesc></figure>
