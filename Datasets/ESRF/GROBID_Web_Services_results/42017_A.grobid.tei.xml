<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Series of ZnO single crystals implanted with Co and B have been characterized by synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction technique at ROBL. These experiments partially represent one of the research topics of Nanofunctional Films Group at FZD, namely, development of magnetically active semiconductimg materials. The ZnO substrates were implanted with B ions and with Co ions with energies 30keV and 80 keV respectively. The fluences of implanted Co were chosen as 8×10 16 and 16×10 16 (cm -2 ).</p><p>The dose of B ions has been varied from 5×10 15 up to 32×10 16 cm -2 for different samples.</p><p>According to the aim of the application it was necessary to identify the origin of magnetism in these samples. Such a source supposed to be represented by magnetic Co-based secondary phases.</p><p>Using coplanar x-ray diffraction technique in a wide range of angles, we performed set of measurements which did not reveal presence of additional crystalline phases, except of ZnO host material. We would note that in the case of nanoparticles self-organization, the concentration of Co-inclusions should be sufficient for their detection, similarly to MgO:Fe systems, where the doses of implanted ions where equal to those studied in the current proposal. Absence of diffraction pattern from secondary (Co-B)-based phases, leads us to a conclusion that those inclusions are in the amorphous state. High-resolution diffraction of the ZnO substrates proves an enhanced diffuse scattering near the reciprocal lattice points of ZnO.</p><p>Using the relations of Huang and Stockes -Willson scatterings the average size of nanoparticles was estimated. We have found that dimensions of (Co-B) -inclusions are in the range from 10 to 40 nm. The size of nanoparticles increases with an increasing of B fluence being in good agreement with SQUID measurements. At the present state, the results of the experiments performed at ROBL, as well as at FZD, are in preparation for publishing.</p><p>In addition to the measurements of Co-B implanted ZnO, the structural investigations of Fe implanted GaN have been performed. The results of these structural measurements show the correlation between structural and magnetic properties of ion implanted GaN:Fe. It was concluded that spinodal decomposition is the preliminary stage before the formation of precipitates. The results of this experiment jointed with the data of magnetic and spectroscopic investigations are submitted to Physical Review B.</p></div>		</body>
