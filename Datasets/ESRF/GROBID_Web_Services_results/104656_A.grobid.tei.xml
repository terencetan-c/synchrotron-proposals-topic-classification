<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of this project is to study recently reported MXene synthesis method in situ using reaction of T3AlC2 (MAX-phase) with Lewis acid molten salts. This method has huge advantages over previously used MXene synthesis methods, as it does not involve highly dangerous HF. Until our experiments at ESRF the reaction products were studied only using ex situ methods after cooling back to ambient temperature and melt solidification.</p><p>Experiments were performed at BM20 beamline using powder samples of Max phase pre-mixed with powder of ZnCl2 in different proportions. The samples were heated rapidly ove rthe melting point of ZnCl2 (290 0 C), above melting point the heating was done with 2 degrees/min up to 550 0 C. Our experiments confirm that the reaction of Max phase with molten ZnCl2 takes several hours. When the reaction was complete or the changes in structure stopped (~5-7 hours), the samples were cooled slowly to the pont of salt solidification and after that rapidly cooled back to ambient temperature. In some experiments the heating was repeated after shifting the capillary to new (not yet melted) spot in order to verify reproducibility.</p><p>Summarizing results, experiments were successfully performed with samples of Max phase immersed in molten ZnCl2 demonstrating expected transformation into new Mxene phase reported in published studies (performed ex situ). The reaction could be observed visually due to formation of bubbles of gases (AlCl3) and change in the sample color. Bubbles disturbed some experiments if the powder sample was moved slightly leading to changes in absolute intensity and background.</p><p>XRD patterns confirmed complete transofrmation of MAX phase into Zn-Mxene which occurs according to proposed mechanbism by etching away Al from Ti3AlC2. New set of XRD reflections was observed to emerge in a sample ZnCl2:Max (6:1, g/g) over period of several hours at 550 0 C. The relative intensity of new peaks was increasing during the annealing and intensity of Max phase decerasing. In the best sample we observed complete transformation (Figure.1). After preliminary analysis we have not found any evidence for formation of intermediate Ti3ZnCl2 phase (Max hase with Al substituted with Zn). This phase was suggested in some literature reports but evidence by XRD presented in these studies was weak.</p><p>We performed also similar experiments with etching Max phase by another salt not yet tested in literature, SnCl2. In situ experiments demonstrated that etching of Max phase by SnCl2 is also posisble, but we did not achieved complete transoformation into Mxene, some XRD reflections from pristine Max phase were still present even after prolonged high temperature annealing. Additional experiments with larger loading of SnCl2 are posisbly needed to achieve complete transformation. More detailed analysis of XRD data will be performed until the end of 2023. Overall we consider our experiment be successful and expect to use collected data for publication. All the goals specified in the proposal were achieved and some additional completely new data recorded.</p><p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Intensity, arb.units Diffraction angle 2Q, degrees Pattern number (002) Max phase (001) Mxene (002) Mxene</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.In situ XRD data recorded during annealing of MAX -phase in molten ZnCl2. The data recorded at 550 0 C (60s per frame) over the period of ~5 hours. Initial pattern shows reflections of MAX-phase, new set of reflections from Mxene emerge and after several hours completely susbtitutes reflections from precursor phase. Experiment shows co-existance of both precursor and Mxene phase over period of several hours.</figDesc></figure>
