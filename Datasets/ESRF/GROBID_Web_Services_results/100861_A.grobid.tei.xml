<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of this experiment was to perform a depth profile study on the nanometric solid electrolyte interphase layer (SEI) formed at the surface of SiO2 anodes for Lithium-ion batteries since a precise control of its chemical composition and structure is crtitical to overcome performance issues related to initial capacity loss, cycle life and rate capability of the anode material. Anodes having different salt (LiPF6 and LiFSI) and different electrolyte additives (FEC, VC and FEC+VC), were subjected to 4 electrochemical cycles until a stable SEI was formed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Cycled anodes were prepared for HAXPES characterization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) inisde a glovebox. In all cases, the SEI was found to be composed of electrolyte decomposition products and silicon-containing species. However, the specific components of the SEI vary depending on the electrolyte used. The C1s spectra with FEC for both LiPF6 and LiFSI contain Li2CO3 togheter with lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) and poly(VC), indicated by the broad shoulder of C-O-C and O--C-O at 12 keV. The sample with pure LiPF6 has a very different curve at 12 keV, compared to the curve with LiPF6+FEC. For the curve with additive we see a clear shoulder from the CO3 signal. According to literature, the additive FEC would increase the Li2CO3 content generated at the SEI [1], which agrees with our results. When comparing with the cells that had VC as additive, the CO3 peak is a bit less intense than with the FEC additive. Here the peak is flattened, which can indicate that there are more signal from the species at lower binding energies, that can indicate there are more poly(VC) with the addition of VC than FEC. The electrochemical performance was better for the samples with FEC than VC additives, this is mabye caused by the increased amount of poly(VC) in the VC SEI. Poly(VC) is described of being a poorly ion conducting polymer, which leads to high cell impedance, and a lower electrochemical performance <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The additive VC have also been reported to inhibit the reduction of EC, therefore decreasing the generation of LEDC and ethylene[3]. This could be the case of what we see in the HAXPES spectra with VC, since there is a lower intensity of the O--C-O shoulder. One of the main difference in the SEI with the different electrolytes is related to the LiF component. One major differences between FEC and VC is the additional flourine atom, and therefore more LiF should be found in the anode cycled with FEC additive. Another thing to report is that the LiPF6 salt is known for the formation of LiF, which regarding the common use of this salt must be an important component of the SEI [3]. In the spectra LiF is present in all the samples. For both samples without additives a peak or shoulder at higher binding energy corresponding to F-S and F-P is observed, which indicates the presence of LiFSI and LiPF6 salt respectively. The spectrum of LiPF6 shows that the peak corresponding to the F-P bond is the strongest, which can indicate incomplete removal of the electrolyte when washed with DMC. All electrodes cycled with additives display a shoulder on the Si1s spectra corresponding to lithium silicates (LixSiOy). Such shoulder is more distinct for the sample with VC as additive, but the reason for this is unclear. It is possible that the SEI is thinner with VC than with FEC, therefore increasing the LixSiOy signal. In some cases, the precence of unreacted SiO2 can also be observed. Quantitative analysis of the acquired datasets is under progress.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1-a) Schemed of SEI formed at the surface of SiO2 negative electrode, b) Mounting of the sample at SpLine HAXPES measurements were performed at two excitation energies: 7 keV and 12 keV, in order to investigate the entire SEI.
