<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Software used for location of sulphurs</head><p>Twenty out of thirty expected selenium positions were determined using Shake-and-Bake version 2.1. These selenium positions were refined and phases were computed using SOLVE 2.01, resulting in a figure-of-merit of 0.34 at 2.25 Å resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Software used for Refinement of sites/phasing/solvent flattening</head><p>A SAD data set was collected at the beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) in Villigen. This data set was used to solve and refine the structure initially. Later, slightly higher resolution data were collected at the ID14-14 beamline at the ESRF Grenoble. Redundant data sets were collected at the peak wavelength which was determined experimentally by fluorescence scans. Data were integrated and scaled with MOSFLM/SCALA <ref type="bibr">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref> or XDS <ref type="bibr">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr">40]</ref>. Data collection statistics are given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Solvent modification was effected with RESOLVE 2.01 <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref> and increased the figureof-merit to 0.58 at 2.05 Å resolution using the SLS data. The resulting electron density map was easily interpretable. Further density modification was carried out using ArpWarp <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref> and concomitantly a partial model including sidechains was built automatically. The resulting model was completed using O <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>. Refinement was carried out with CNS [46] against the anomalous peak data. Care was taken to partition both Friedel mates either in the test or working set. Anomalous scattering factors for selenium were refined using CNS after the model had reached an R free of 0.28. In the final stages of refinement NCS restrains were removed. This procedure was judged to be valid by the drop in both R and R free by about 1%.</p></div>
