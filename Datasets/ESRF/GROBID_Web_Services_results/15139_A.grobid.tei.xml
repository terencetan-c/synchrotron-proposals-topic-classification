<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Photosystem II (PS II) samples were exposed to X-ray irradiation and simultaneously illuminated by single-turnover flashes of intense light (at room temperature). For illumination three synchronized flash-lamps were used (µs flashes, 500-800 nm).</p><p>The results of this study prove that a combination of flash illumination and XAS can facilitate investigations on intermediate states of the catalytic S-state cycle of PS II. For the first time, evidence has been provided by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy at physiologically relevant temperatures that the S 1 -S 2 transition of the oxygen-evolving complex is coupled to manganese oxidation and that the oxygen-evolving S 3 -S 0 transition is coupled to manganese reduction. We feel that these experiments pave the road to a new type of XAS experiments.</p><p>Due to the use of Xenon flash lamps, pronounced S-state mixing occurred (flashes too weak and too long, inappropriate spectral characteristics). Therefore, publication of the results of this (successful) feasibility study would be premature. A satisfactory S-state population requires the use of ns LASER flashes (green light; e.g. 532 nm). We intend to pursue further this promising line of experiments using LASER illumination. The S 1 -S 2 transition was initiated by application of a single µs-flash of intense light; both sides of the optically thick sample were illuminated simultaneously. Within a few milliseconds after the µs-flash, a rapid XAS scan was started.</p><p>Even though the S 1 -S 2 transition proceeds in less than 1 ms, the S-state decay requires several minutes. Therefore the S-state decay during the scanning period of only 1 s is negligible. The observed edge shift is indicative of manganese oxidation upon the S 1 -S 2 transition.</p><p>Figure2. Five µs-flashes of intense light were applied to samples exposed to the X-ray beam (flash frequency of 3.3 Hz). The timecourse of the Xray fluorescence intensity was monitored (fixed X-ray energy).</p><p>The shown data points represent the fluorescence intensity averaged for 300 ms (between flashes). For energies close to the inflection point of the edge, a decrease (increase) in the fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption points towards manganese oxidation (reduction). The results prove that a combination of flash illumination and XAS can facilitate investigations on intermediate states of the catalytic S-state cycle. Due to the use of inappropriate Xenon flash-lamps pronounced S-state mixing has occurred (estimated miss parameter of 40-50%). Excitation by green-light LASER pulses (of ns duration) should result in significantly reduced S-state mixing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Dr. Holger Dau, Freie Universität Berlin, FB Physik, Arnimallee 14, D-14195 Berlin (former address: Philipps-Universität Marburg, FB Biologie, Lahnberge, D-35032 Marburg) The experiments at the ESRF were carried out at ID 26 by: Holger Dau (Marburg, Berlin) Pavel Pospisil (Marburg, Berlin) Jens Dittmer (Marburg, Florence) Armando Solé (ESRF)</figDesc></figure>
