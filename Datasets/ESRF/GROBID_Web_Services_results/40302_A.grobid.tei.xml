<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Computed tomography studies of failure processes in polymer composite laminate </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Background: The experiment addressed the canonical problem of failure from notches in carbon fibre composite laminates, with the particular aim of providing detailed visualisation and measurements for model initialisation and validation 1,2 . Via the combination of in situ loading of samples and internal 3D visualisation of internal structure, exceptional fidelity of micromechanical measurement has been achieved, with full field 3D microstrain mapping being obtained for the first time in this important class of material. Highlights of this work included: (i) In situ testing of samples with and without a sparse population of 5µm Al particles to act as fiducial marks. Processing constraints required these to be placed at ply interfaces, with an air dispersal process being developed to produce consistent in-plane spacings of the order of 100-200µm. Potential effects of this relatively sparse distribution were checked, with both macroscopic measurement of laminate fracture strengths and micromechanical observation of failure (via SRCT) showing no significant effect of the aluminium fiducials on composite behaviour.</p><p>(ii) Large volumes of material were sampled via rastering of the imaging region along the sample length, allowing quantification of failure to higher loads (cf. the initial CT element of experiment MA313), as cracks in longitudinal splits progress many millimeters prior to failure.</p><p>(iii) Several material variants were addressed, specifically toughened vs. non-toughened matrices, and quasi-isotropic vs. simple cross-ply laminates.</p><p>Parallel use of acoustic emission sensing to detect the early onset of failure unfortunately had to be abandonded due to the loss of key staff in the immediate runup to the experiment, however the opportunity was taken to consider the alternative material variants (noted above) that had not been considered feasible in the original experimental design.</p><p>Results: Whilst analysis of the data obtained is ongoing, the comprehensive characterisation of failure that has been achieved is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> for a toughened matrix cross-ply laminate, from earliest crack onset in the narrow notched region, to just loads just below the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The microstructual dependence of cracking was clearly seen, with local crack pinning events attributable to the presence of inter-and intra-ply matrix rich regions, and the discontinuous, cross-hatched nature of delamination attributable to a mix of fibre and toughening phase debonding in the resin rich inter-ply region. The present experiment clearly demonstrated and quantified the unexpectedly high levels of unbroken ligament area maintained across delaminations in toughened matrix systems right up to the point of failure. The full field 3D mapping of internal strains is also ongoing, however initial findings can be reported, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. In particular, a combination of digital image correlation and quasimanual single particle tracking is being used to validate data reduction methods. It is our ultimate intention to make the datasets freely downloadable to the community, providing a unique common resource for composite modelling.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. I.

Wright, A.J. Moffat, A. Renault, I. Sinclair, S.M. Spearing Abstract: In situ synchrotron radiation computed tomography has been used during tensile testing of CFRP [90/0] S laminates to obtain 3D images of initiation and propagation of sub-critical damage. The damage has been quantified to provide exceptionally detailed initialisation and validation of 3D finite element modelling of splitting in 0º plies and transverse ply cracks.
