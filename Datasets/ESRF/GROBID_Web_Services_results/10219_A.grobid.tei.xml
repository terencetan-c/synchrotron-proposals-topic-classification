<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to demonstrate the feasibility of recording the Bragg peaks of higher order (cl l&gt; or ~20~) associated to a 2D hexagonal crystal of 1-hexadecanol. In precedent experiments realized at ESRF in July 95 and February 1996 (SC-176), we have established the scenario of melting of the 1-decanol and the 1-dodecanol <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. However neither with decanol nor with dodecanol, we could observe Bragg peaks of higher order <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>.</p><p>We have determined that the Bragg peak &lt;lo&gt; is a power law singularity, with S(Q) = IQ-Q01-2+n (l), where Q is the momentum transfer and Q. is the Bragg position. In the framework of the bidimensional melting theory, it is found q = TQo2/h (2), where h is the chain length. After 2D powder averaging, the relation (1) leads to an intensity of the Bragg peak proportional to IQ-Q,,l-'+n; then q=l is an upper limit above which no other peak can be observed. Far from melting, we obtain a value of 7-\ &gt; 0.31 for decanol and = 0.24 for dodecanol, for the &lt;lo&gt; reflection. This implies for decanol a value of q &gt; 1 for the nearest peak, associated to the &lt;l l&gt; reflection then impossible to detect. For hexadecanol the expected value of q is &lt; 1, which means a detectable intensity at least of the &lt; l l &gt; reflection. In 2D systems, the bidimensional fluctuations lead to strong decrease of the X-ray scattering intensity with Q. But according to equation ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), the longer the chain is, the more rigid is the monolayer which implies that the fluctuations are less important. Therefore the Bragg peaks of higher order are more likely to be observed with alcohol monolayers of chain length &gt; C13. All of these explain difficulties of the experiment and demand of high flux of the X-ray beam.</p><p>We have used a high resolution set-up of X-ray grazing incidence diffraction to measure the Bragg peak of alcohol monolayer. The incident beam was shaped at h= 1.40873 A by a Si( 111) monochromator, followed by a flat mirror. The incident angle on the water surface was 2.03 mrad (0.8 0,). The sample was inside our specially designed trough having a good thermal stability and homogeneity and water level regulation better than +5 pm. We analysed the diffractted intensity with an Ge(111) analyzer (resolution 0.011") and a vertcal PSD.</p><p>The experiment began with the installation of our home-made trough. The trough was flowed with He to reduce background. We tune and test of all the setup with reflection &lt;lo&gt; from well studied 2D crystal1 of 1-dodecanol. The monolayers of 1-hexadecanol were deposited in their liquid phase (Tzn melting is 67 "C) then the temperature was decreased until 30 'C. We recorded spectra around position of Bragg peaks &lt;lo&gt;, cl l&gt;, c20&gt; during the increasing temperature (from 30 "C to 67 "C) until the melting of the monolayer and decreasing of temperature (from 12 'C to 5 "C).</p><p>Some of the spectra for of Bragg peaks &lt;lo&gt; are shown on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. We found that in case of hexadecanol broadening of the peak has oposit from short alcohols (decanol, dodecanol) behavior. With decreasing the temperature from the melting point (67°C) to SC, the Bragg peak for short alcohols becomes weaker and broader whereas for hexadecanol it becomes stronger and thinner. This difference could come from the increase of interaction between chains with increasing of alcohol length that leads to slight distortion of hexagonal cell with decrease of temperature. Analysis of the Bragg peak shape using power law gives that coherence length vary from 14300 A at 57.5 'C to 750 A at 5.2 'C.</p><p>Rodscans of &lt;lo&gt; Bragg peak (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) show that thickness of the monolayer is almost the same in wide range of temperatures (30 'C &lt;T&lt;60 "C) but is twice thick at 5.2 'C.</p><p>At each temperature we systematically tried to find Bragg peaks of higher orders: cl I&gt;, &lt;20&gt; and corresponding to &lt;r/20&gt;. We expect to have very weak and broad peak so we made wide range of scan in 28. In all cases for peaks &lt;20&gt; and &amp;O&gt; we saw only background that linearly increase with decreasing of 28. Calculation of parameter TJ for peak &lt;lo&gt; carried out after the experiment gives 77 &gt; 0.4 for Tc30 'C. So it is not surprising that we did not observe higher orders of Bragg peak. But for T&gt;30 'C q is less then 0.4 and we could detect at least &lt; l l &gt;. Indeed at T=30 'C and 53.2 'C we got the spectra (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) that could be interperet as &lt; 1 1 &gt; Bragg peak. But these spectra was none completely reproducible and on rodscans we did not see clear Vineyard peak that could be also very weak due to large width of the peak. So we are not completely sure that observed peaks are higher order Bragg peaks. Obviously that intensity of the peak is very weak and could be smeared out with diffuse scattering from the water if the position of monolayer is not at the optimum. The latter may be one of the reason of n-reproducibility of the spectra.</p></div>			</div>
