<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The spin-orbit exciton and thus peaks B and C can be reasonably well described by a simple picture of individual Ir ions in a non-cubic crystal field. The observation that peaks B and C are located at the same energy for all three compounds immediately tells us that both the non-cubic crystal field and the size of spinorbit coupling are very similar in all three compounds, despite the different crystal structures.</p><p>The excitonic interpretation of peak A requires to go beyond a simple single-site picture, In agreement with the data of Gretarsson et al.</p><p>[1] on Na 2 IrO 3 , the spectra we measured on α-Li 2 IrO 3 at different transferred momentum q show negligible dispersion of all three excitations, see figure on p. 2. For peaks B and C, this agrees with the predominantly local character of the spin-orbit exciton. However, it also indicates a local character of peak A. Furthermore, we observe that the intensity of peak A shows a strong dependence on the transferred momentum q, see figure. This explains why peak A was less pronounced in the powder data, averaging over all directions of q. It furthermore will allow us to reveal the precise character of peak A based on a detailed analysis of the observed q dependence. We will also compare the energy of peak A determined in the RIXS measurement with results of optical measurements for the Mott gap.</p><p>[1] Gretarsson et al., <ref type="bibr">Phys. Rev.

Physikalisches Institut, University of Cologne Chin Chyi Loo * II. Physikalisches Institut, University of Cologne Report: High-resolution RIXS has been measured at the Ir L 3 edge at T = 10 K on the tricoordinated Mott-insulating iridates α-Li 2 IrO 3 , Na 2 IrO 3 , and β-Li 2 IrO 3. The first two show a monoclinic lattice structure featuring stacks of quasi-2D honeycomb layers. Samples of both compounds show stacking faults that lead to the formation of three different domains. By scanning the samples' surface we found a spot where a single domain was dominant (&gt; 90%). In the case of Na 2 IrO 3 , we measured on an ab surface with b in the scattering plane. RIXS data of α-Li 2 IrO 3 were measured on an ab surface with the b axis forming an angle of 60° with the scattering plane. The compound β-Li 2 IrO 3 shows an orthorhombic crystal structure. Here, we measured on an ab surface with b perpendicular to the scattering plane. Gretarsson et al. [1] Previous RIXS data on single crystals of Na 2 IrO 3 by Gretarsson et al. [1] revealed three peaks denoted as A, B, and C, see figure on bottom right on p. 1. Peaks B and C were attributed [1] to the spin-orbit exciton, i.e., the excitation from the j=1/2 ground state to the j=3/2 excited state. The peak splitting signals a non-cubic crystal field. Furthermore, Gretarsson et al. [1] interpreted peak A as an exciton in the vicinity of the Mott gap. RIXS data on polycrystalline α-Li 2 IrO 3 show similar features but a much broader peak A [1]. Our RIXS data on Na 2 IrO 3 are consistent with those measured by Gretarsson et al. [1]. Remarkably, our data on single crystals of α-Li 2 IrO 3 and β-Li 2 IrO 3 reveal a stunning similarity between all three compounds, see figure on bottom left of p. 1. The energies of peaks A, B, and C are very similar in all three compounds, In contrast to the powder data of Gretarsson et al. [1], the single-crystal data on α-Li 2 IrO 3 show a very sharp peak A, in close agreement with the other compounds.</figDesc></figure>
