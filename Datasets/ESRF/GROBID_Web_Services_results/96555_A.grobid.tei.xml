<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unraveling of nsp14 interactions with nsp10 and various ligands</head><p>Samples were measured in SEC-SAXS mode at BM29/ESRF, Grenoble France on 12.12.2020. (session ID MX2341). Samples (100 µL) were measured on Agilent AdvanceBio SEC 300 with 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 150mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol running phase at 0.16 mL/min flowrate. The measurements were performed at 0.99 Å wavelength. The sample to detector distance was set at 2.83 m with Pilatus2M detector for data acquisition.</p><p>Guinier analysis of scattering profiles established that the largest radii of gyration (Rg) characterized the ternary complex (40.3±1.0 Å). Nsp14 and the nsp14/nsp10 complexes were characterized by significantly smaller Rgs (28.0±0.5 and 30.1±1.8 Å, respectively); the nsp10/16 complex was characterized by the smallest (Rg = 21.0±1.5 Å). This data corresponds with the expected molecular weights of tested complexes at 1:1:1 stoichiometry, further supporting the stoichiometry of the ternary complex.</p><p>The estimated molecular weights of a scatterer differ from the expected values, perhaps the result of the flexibility of the tested system (SAXS averages all conformations). Nonetheless, the relative values follow the expected pattern, with nsp10/16 characterized by the lowest and the nsp10/14/16 ternary complex by the highest molecular weight, as determined by SAXS.</p><p>When reconstructed in real space using the indirect Fourier transform software GNOM, the scattering profiles present roughly Gaussian shapes with significant tailing for nsp10/14/16 and nsp10/14, indicating an elongated globular nature for the protein complexes, with peaks overlapping with radii of gyration obtained using Guinier analysis. The calculated maximal distances within scatterers support the trend established above, with nsp10/16 constituting the smallest complex at 80.0 Å, nsp14 at 95.8 Å, nsp10/14 at 122.0 Å, and the nsp10/14/16 at 140.0 Å (longest axis). Molecular envelopes which best represent the scattering profiles were calculated using DAMMIF software. Crystal structures of nsp10/16, nsp14 and nsp10/14 and a model of the ternary complex, created assuming the "lid" hypothesis, were fitted into the envelopes using the SUPCOMB software. The crystal structures of nsp14 and nsp10/14 fit the molecular envelopes poorly, suggesting that these two remain flexible in solution. The structure of nsp10/16 fills the envelope tightly, suggesting complex rigidity in solution. The initial model of the ternary complex already filled the envelope relatively well and was further optimized via normal mode analysis using the SREFLEX software. SREFLEX rotates and translates rigid body domains of the input model within the constraints of flexible loops, optimizing the fit to the experimental envelope. The resulting heterotrimer model was characterized by a value of 1.08 for goodness-of-fit to the experimental SAXS data, suggesting a likely solution. The model fits the envelope tightly, suggesting rigidification of nsp14 structure upon ternary complex formation (compare nsp10/nsp14 envelope fit).The decomposition of the triplex scattering profile into volume fractions calculated from the binary complexes nsp10/14, nsp10/16 crystal structures or extracted individual protein in the software Oligomer suggest that the signal can be divided 1:1 into nsp10/16 and nsp14. This further implies that nsp10/16 interface within the triplex is retained, while it is nsp14 that</p></div>
