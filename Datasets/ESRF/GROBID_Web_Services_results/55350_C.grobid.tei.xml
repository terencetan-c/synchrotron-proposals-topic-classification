<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We aimed to investigate the cellular distribution of a series of Os(II) and Ir(III) drug candidates, namely [Os(ŋ 6 -p-cym)(Azpy-NMe 2 )I]PF 6 [1], [Os(ŋ 6 -bip)(Azpy-F)I]PF 6 [2] [Ir(ŋ 5 -cp xph )(Azpy-NMe 2 )Cl]PF 6 [3] and [Ir(ŋ 5 -C pxbiph )(phpy)(py)]PF 6 [4] (p-cym = p-cymene,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Azpy-NMe 2 = 2-(p-[dimethylamino]phenylazo) pyridine, bip = biphenyl, Azpy-F = 2-(p- [dimethylamino]phenylazo)-5-Fluoropyridine, cp xph = tetramethyl(phenyl)cyclopentadienyl, cp xbiph =</formula><p>tetramethyl(biphenyl)cyclopentadienyl, phpy = 2-phenylpyridine, and py = pyridine), at ID16A using X-ray fluorescence nanoprobe (XRFN). These potent anticancer complexes show interesting in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative properties due to alteration of the cellular redox balance (possibly involving mitochondrial pathways), 1,2,3 and identifying their intracellular target sites, would be key to understanding their mechanism of action, and contribute to their advance towards phase I of clinical trials against platinum resistant ovarian cancer.</p><p>A2870 ovarian carcinoma cells treated with different concentrations of 1-4 (IC 50 to 10 µM) were prepared on 5x5 mm carbon frames with 500 nm silicon nitride windows (Silson Ltd, UK), both as epon embedded sections (500 nm thickness) and whole cells (fixed with Methanol or PFA). Untreated cells were prepared similarly as negative controls. The frames were placed under vacuum (in a sample holder with capacity for four frames) and irradiated individually using ID16A standard energy setting (17 KeV). XRF emission was collected using two six elements silicon drift diode detectors. Fast coarse scans were taken to identify interesting areas (beam size 400x400 nm, dwell time 100 ms), that were then studied using higher resolution (beam size 50x50 or 20x20 nm, dwell time 40ms or 50 ms). No phase constrast images could be obtained due to lack of time, so a density of 2 µm or 500 nm was estimated (for whole cells and sections respectively) for the processing of the images (that were normalised according to the beam flux).</p><p>A clear and distintive set of peaks corresponding to Os-L emission was observed in samples treated with 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Unfortunately, no Ir emission could be detected on cells treated with 3 or 4 and we did not have time to study samples treated with 2. Initial scans also showed that PFA is better preserving the structure of A2780 cells than methanol (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), and that our fixation proceedure did not managed to dehydrate completely cells, as some of them exploded when irradiated.</p><p>Images of cells incubated with 1 (1 µM or IC 50 : 0.14 µM; Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) showed that Os did not overlap with Zn or P maps. This suggests that the drug does not localise in the nucleus. Cells treated with 1 also showed abnormal shaped nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>; compared with untreated cells, Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>), and possible membrane blebbing; which might indicate that they are going through an apoptotic process.</p><p>Remarkably, 1 was concentrated in small elliptical areas around 0.3-0.4 µm in length, similar in size and shape to the mitochondria of fast growing tumour cells (as A2780), but also to vesicles and other organelles. Unfortunately, mitochondrial localisation could not be assesed as planned in the proposal (using antibodyconjugated nanogold) due to lack of experimental time. Nevertheless, these results are the first to bring light on the intracellular distribution of this kind of compounds and a fast publication is envisioned.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="1,307.75,442.85,258.00,196.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
