<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Crystallographic studies of proteins involved in vitamin B1 biosynthesis and polyuridylation of mRNA Proposal number MX-1392. Assigned number of Shifts: 2.</p><p>We came to the synchrotron with numerous ligand-soaked crystals (~140) of two proteins involved in poly(U) polymerization and in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>The aim of the first project was to determine the structure of the substrate-or product-bound forms of Thi5, an enzyme implicated in the vitamin B1 biosynthesis pathway in yeast. Therefore, we tested Thi5 protein crystals soaked or co-crystallized with PLP (pyridoxal 5'phosphate) or HMP (hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine), respectively the expected subtrate and product of Thi5. Moreover, we tested Thi5 protein crystals soaked with iron atoms, which seem to be required for the enzymatic reaction of Thi5, in order to have a complete overview of this mechanism.</p><p>We have collected 8 data sets at a resolution of 2.7 to 3.2 Å with the different combinations of soaking. The analysis of these diffraction data are on going and the preliminary results indicate clearly the presence of PLP (and HMP?) in the active site of Thi5. However, the iron ions seem to be absent in our models.</p><p>The aim of second project was to determine the structure of Cid1, a template-independent poly(U) polymerase which we have recently obtained the UTP-bound crystal structure by SAD method <ref type="bibr">(Munoz-Tello et al., 2012)</ref>, in complex with its product and substrate. Since this protein is able to add either a poly(U) or poly(A) tail, we did several soaks and cocrystallization trials of the native Cid1 and an inactive mutant with ATP, UTP, UMpNpp and ApCpp with a minimal product in other to better understand Cid1's function and selectivity. We hope that this mutant will particularly block the substrate and product in the active site. We collected 13 data sets at 2.5 and up to 1.5 Å resolution with the different combinations of ligand and product. So far, none of the ATP/ApU soaked crystals or UTP/UpU crystals had the two forms in the active site: most of them had either only the UTP, or nothing. Interestingly, one data set of the inactive protein showed an ApU molecule in the active site.</p><p>In conclusion, these two shifts have allowed us to successfully collect multiple datasets for both projects. The data collected for the first project allowed us to build a model of the substrate-bound (and product-bound?) forms of Thi5 and gave us some insights into the reaction mechanism of this enzyme. For the second project, the analysis of the data sets collected will give us a hint on Cid1 polymerization mechanism and substrate/product accomodation. Preliminary results show the abscence of a ATP-bound form of the protein which will hep us understand the out-competition of UTP over ATP of this enzyme. Other 3 data sets have to still be analyzed for the presence or absence of the substrate/product molecules. Finally, model building and refinements for the ApU-bound Cid1 protein are ongoing.</p></div>
