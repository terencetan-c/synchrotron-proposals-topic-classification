<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Nanocrystalline thin films are in the focus of many investigations due to their outstanding properties. The presence of nanotwins was discovered to enhance the strength of pure metal films. Alloying of the films, furthermore, can stabilize microstructural features like grain boundaries but also twins, which enhances, in turn the thermal stability of the films. In that context we investigate magnetron-sputtered Ni-W films exhibiting a nanocrystalline and {111} fiber-textured microstructure, showing pronounced nanotwinning parallel to the surface. In this experiment, in particular, the evolution of the nanotwin structure upon annealing was studied non-destructively and partially in-situ on the basis of the associated weak diffuse scattering.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>The nanotwins aligned parallel to the film surface cause streaks of diffuse intensity in the reciprocal space, which can be evaluated using the software DIFFaXplus [J. <ref type="bibr">Appl. Crystallogr. 37 (2004)</ref> 166] in order to determine the twin density. For each film and temperature, approximately 100 Θ-2Θ scans were performed by the use of a Mythen detector at different tilt angles χ. The construction of the intensity distribution along a diffuse-intensity streak in the reciprocal space as a function of the reciprocal space coordinate L hex by the use of the measured Θ-2Θ scans is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The averaged intensity of the middle 5 % of each Θ-2Θ scan corresponds to one point of the intensity distribution along the streak in the reciprocal space. The temperature program was performed by the use of an Anton Paar DHS 900 heating chamber, heating from 305 K to 800 K in steps of 50 K and cooling down in 3 steps. Additionally, the intensity distributions along the streak in the reciprocal space of previously annealed films at 800 K for different aging times were investigated at ambient temperature. The described in-situ investigation was unfortunately interrupted twice due to beam dumps, leading to deviations from the initially planned thermal treatments and thus difficultly interpretable diffraction data. Moreover, problems with the temperature control arose, which were not encountered earlier. Therefore, not all planned experiments could be performed and an additional beamtime would be appreciated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results</head><p>The evolution of the intensity distribution along the analyzed streak in the reciprocal space of the NiW12 film, i.e. containing 12 at.% W, as a function of temperature is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>. At 700 K, the intensity maxima sharpen slightly, whereas no distinct change could be observed at lower temperatures. Upon further heating, the sharpening proceeds, as also during the first cooling step from 800 K down to 650 K. The occurrence of intensity-maxima sharpening along the investigated streak in the reciprocal space corresponds to detwinning processes: The sharper the intensity maxima the smaller the twin density. The exact twin densities were extracted by the use of the program DIFFaXplus. As an example, a successful fit of the intensity distribution along the streak of a NiW12 film heated ex-situ 1 h at 800 K is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, indicating a twin probability of 17 %.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implication of the Results</head><p>We could demonstrate that it is possible to measure twin probabilities in-situ during heating and cooling. Moreover, reliable and meaningful measurements of ex-situ annealed samples could be performed, i.e. the measurement method is robust. The measurements indicate that the thermal stability of nanotwins is strongly influenced by the W content. Further and more detailed evaluation and interpretation are in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example for a construction of the intensity distribution along the investigated streak in reciprocal space as function of the coordinate L hex by the use of Θ-2Θ scans.
