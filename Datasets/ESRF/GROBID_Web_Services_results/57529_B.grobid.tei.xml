<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We measured inelastic X-ray scattering on the triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLA) LiCrO 2 . We observed a large change of the phonon spectrum from 300 K down to 5 K. The changes are attributed to the magnon phonon interaction present in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>We aligned our sample in the (H,H,L) plane to access both the triangular (H,K,0) plane and the perpendicular direction. This particular choice of orientation is also due to the shape of the crystal which is plate like in the ab-plane, with this orientation we could optimise the location of the beam spot on the sample. In order to measure the phonon spectrum with high enough Xray flux, we chose the Œª=0.6968 √Ö using the Si(9,9,9) reflection of the main-monochromator, which provided an overall energy resolution of 3.0 meV full-width-half maximum. The beam size was about 50x50 ¬µm 2 which we positioned on the sample surface where the incoherent scattering was the weakest to reduce background, see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The momentum resolution was set to 0.3 (horizontal) x 0.9 (vertical) nm -2 . Energy transfer scans were performed at constant momentum transfer (Q), selected by appropriate choices of scattering angle and sample orientation. The maximum scattering angle in this setup was limited to 48¬∞, which restricted us in reciprocal space to ùêª ‚â≤ 1.5 along the Q=(H,H,0) direction in the triangular plane. The analyzer efficiencies and energy resolution was determined during calibration prior to our experiment. The sample was aligned in the scattering plane on the (0,0,6) and (1,1,0) Bragg peaks. The temperature was controlled by a closed cycle refrigerator with a Joule-Thomson stage to reach 7.1 K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>At 295 K we observed acoustic phonons at zone boundary energies of 30.8(4) and 34.6(2) meV and an optical phonon mode at 59.2(1) meV at Q=(1.5,1.5,0), in good agreement with our previous ab initio phonon calculation, see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Upon cooling the sample, the optical phonon mode was continuously shifting upwards in energy while the lower acoustic phonons decrease in intensity enormously almost disappearing at 7.1 K, see Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. Beside we observe a new excitation appearing at 7.9(7) meV at 100 K and increasing in energy up to 10.3(2) meV at 7.1 K. We attribute these large changes to the magnon phonon coupling and the new peak around 10 meV to a magnon mode that strongly mixes with the lower longitudinal acoustic phonon mode.</p></div>

Note the temperature dependence of the excitations at 10 and 30 meV. The peak around 10 meV was identified as a magnon by INS. (b) Dispersion of the excitations found by IXS at T = 7.1 K, the area of the circles is proportional to the quasiparticle peak intensity, while radius of the circles on (c) are proportional to the intrinsic line width of the excitations. Note the roton minimum in the dispersion at H = 1.5, E ~ 10 meV.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,58.56,353.28,478.08,347.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
