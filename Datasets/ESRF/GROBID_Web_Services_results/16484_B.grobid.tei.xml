<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We performed small-angle scattering experiments from an oriented sample of diblock copolymer melt of poly(dimethyl siloxane)-b-poly(ethylene propylene) in its lamellar phase. The sample was placed in a glass capillary of cross section 100 µm x 1 mm, the lamellae being parallel to sample walls. In all experiments, the sample was positioned with the lamellar planes along the beam, to produce (small-angle) Bragg diffraction. In one control experiment the sample was positioned with lamellar planes perpendicular to the beam, which gave no diffraction at all; in this way we verified the proper orientation of the lamellar planes. Both the CCD detector and the image plate were used for detection.</p><p>The scattering pattern consisted of two well-localized first order peaks on each side of the beam catcher, characteristic of an oriented lamellar structure. Second order diffraction could hardly be detected as commonly observed with weakly segregated copolymers. We studied, as a function of temperature, the intensity I B and position q 0 of the first order peak, as well as its line shape. We have found 4 temperature regimes in the temperature dependence of I B and q 0 with transitions at 42, 64 and 66 o C. The last transition is the order-to-disorder temperature (ODT) above which the sample becomes a homogeneous melt. The smectic period of this sample in the lamellar state is of the order of 7 nm. It decreases continuously on heating towards the ODT of 66 o C but just before this temperature it exhibits an unexpected small stepwise increase shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The main purpose of this experiment was to observe the Caillé wing in the profile of the first order diffraction peak, arising from thermal fluctuations in the distance of the lamellar planes. We have indeed observed this wing. It is in principle possible to calculate from its shape the product of the splay and bulk elastic moduli of the material. We have found that the dynamics of the CCD detector is not sufficient to perform the experiment at all temperatures, since the Caillé wing decreases as the temperature approaches the order-todisorder temperature. Thus we were led to use the image plate for detection in many of the experiments with which we got usable results; a typical Bragg line profile is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The Caillé exponent that we can calculate from these data is slightly larger than the expected value. One of possible reasons could be residual imperfections in the alignment of the sample.</p><p>A manuscript describing the obtained results is being finalized and will be submitted for publication in the coming weeks. -6 -4 -2 0 0 1 2 3</p><p>log (q-q 0 ) log I</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.
