<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Methylaspartate ammonia lyase (MAL) catalyses the magnesium-dependent reversible α,β-elimination of ammonia from L-threo-(2S,3S)-3-methylaspartic acid to give mesaconic acid. This enzyme has considerable biotechnological potential for the chiral synthesis of novel amino acids but, currently, its three dimensional structure is unknown, as is the molecular basis of substrate specificity and catalysis.</p><p>Data were collected to 2.1Å resolution at three wavelengths (0.979628 Å, 0.979463 Å &amp; 0.968634 Å) from a single cryo-frozen Se-Met form A crystal at station BM 30A of the ESRF, using the inverse beam geometry rotation camera method and a MAR345 image plate. The wavelengths corresponded to the Se K-edge f' minimum, f" maximum and high energy remote positions, as determined on the basis of an X-ray fluorescence spectrum collected directly from the crystal, which was analysed by the program CHOOCH (Evans, G. 1994).</p><p>A solution for all 10 of the selenium atoms in a single polypeptide chain was found in space group P4 1 22 using the program SOLVE.</p><p>To produce an atomic model of MAL automatic model building was performed with the program ARP/wARP 5.0 (Perrakis, A., 1999) using the phases output from SOLVE at 2.1 Å. The warpNtrace procedure within ARP/wARP 5.0 produced a partial model containing 380 of the 413 residues with a mixture of fully and partially built side chains. The remaining parts of the main chain structure were built manually using O ( Jones <ref type="bibr">et al., 1991)</ref>, side chains were not rebuilt at this point. This model was then subjected to the side-chain identification and sequence docking procedure associated with warpNtrace <ref type="bibr">(Perrakis et al., 1999)</ref>. The sequence was docked with 100% certainty and the resulting model was subjected to several rounds of rebuilding and refinement with REFMAC <ref type="bibr">( Murshudov et al., 1997)</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>using data in the resolution range 20 Å-2.1 Å. Water molecules were added with the program ARP( Lamzin et al., 1997)  which was run in conjunction with REFMAC.Each subunit of MAL comprises two domains, one of which adopts a folding pattern reminiscent of the triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel. Substrate binding studies have identified the active site as lying at the Cterminal end of the barrel. Structure comparisons have shown that, despite very low sequence similarity, the structure of MAL is closely related to representative members of the enolase superfamily including Mandelate Racemase, Muconate Lactonising Enzyme I and Enolase. On the basis of its structure, the mechanism of MAL is clearly related to that of the enolase superfamily and involves the initial abstraction of a proton α to the 3carboxyl of (2S,3S)-3-methylasparic acid, to yield an enolic intermediate. Key residues involved in catalysis are a cluster of 3 carboxyls that bind the Mg 2+ (Asp 307, Glu 273 &amp; Asp 238) and a base (Lys 331) to abstract the proton. This analysis resolves the conflict which had linked MAL to the histidine and phenylalanine ammonia lyase family of enzymes, which require a post-translationally modified residue at the active site and for which the structure of MAL provides no support.</figDesc></figure>
