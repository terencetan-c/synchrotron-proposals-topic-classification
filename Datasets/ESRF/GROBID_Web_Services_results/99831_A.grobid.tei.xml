<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The planned experiments aimed at gaining more details about the in-plane structuring of different thiols selfassembled on gold-coated silicon blocks. They are used in the PhD project of Serena Cozzolino as mimetics of normal or damaged hair surface, to study adsorption of model surfactants and polymers (components of haircare products). Two techniques were envisaged: X-ray Reflectometry (XRR) and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD). Most of the allocated time was needed to set up the appropriate configuration to perform experiments on the desired system. Gold, in fact, is not ideal for X-rays but it was needed to compare the results to those obtained by other techniques, and because it is the easiest way to have hydrocarbon chains covalently attached on the surface (necessary for experiments at the solid/liquid interface).</p><p>Measurements were done on test samples of bare or functionalized silicon, whose expected signal was known, to check the modified set-ups. Then they were performed on the actual samples, i.e., gold-coated silicon or glass chips functionalized with: 1. Octadecanethiol 2.</p><p>50:50 octadecanethiol:sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate 3. Butanethiol 4.</p><p>50:50 butanethiol:sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate 5.</p><p>2-methyl-1-butanethiol 6.</p><p>50:50 2-methyl-1-butanethiol:sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate Samples 1, 3 and 5 give hydrophobic surfaces with different chain packing, i.e., they mimic different types of "healthy hair" surfaces. Samples 2, 4 and 6, as hydrophilic, partly charged surfaces, are "damaged hair" models. GIXD measurements could not give the expected results, as the ring due to polycrystalline gold covered other signals, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Left, the signal (at about half of the pink line) expected for a hydrocarbon chain on a silicon test sample. Right, the signal for Sample 1; the rings are present also on the bare gold surface, no signal due to the hydrocarbon chain is detectable XRR measurements allowed the characterization of samples 2-6 in air (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), after optimization of the conditions to avoid beam damage. The first measurement with a standard set-up, in fact, immediately burnt the sample.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. XRR curves on samples 2-6. The 3 chips produced for sample 1 were all damaged looking for the best settings for XRR measurements.</p><p>A different gold-coated substrate was in the meantime functionalized with octadecanethiol and measured by XRR. An experiment at the solid/liquid interface was also performed (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Sample 1 (on different substrate) in air and in water without and with a surfactant solution. The curves in water are overlapping as there is not enough contrast between the various species to distinguish between adsorbed surfactant layer and bulk aqueous solution.</p></div>		</body>
