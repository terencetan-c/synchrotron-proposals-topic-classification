Sanchez-Valle * , C. Kusebauch * and C. Plückthun * Institute for Mineralogy, WWU Münster, Germany D. Testemale * ESRF BM30B, CNRS Grenoble, France Report:</p><p>Arc magmas, which are produced when cold hydrated oxidized oceanic crust is subducted below the mantle in sudduction zones, are characterized by a higher oxydation degree compared to magmas from other locations. The oxidized signature is considered to be related to the influx of an oxidized fluid from the dehydrating subducted slab, but the nature of the oxidizing agent remains unclear. Although water may act as an efficient oxidizing agent in many terrestrial environments, this is not the case in the Earth's upper mantle.</p><p>The oxidized signature may be thus transferred by chemical components mobilized by the slab-flux, namely Fe, S or C. The aim of this proposal was to investigate the oxidizing capacity of slab fluids that infiltrate the source of arc magmas by monitoring the speciation/redox state of Fe by XANES in aqueous fluids and hydrous silicate melts at high pressure (up to 2 GPa) and different redox conditions relevant for the presentday mantle wedge (FMQ to HM).</p><p>The original experimental plan involved XANES measurements in the diamond anvil cell (DAC) using the micro-focus station of FAME. Unfortunately, short before the experiments the KB mirror of FAME was damaged and experiments could not be conducted in the diamond anvil cell. Therefore, the experimental plan was modified to investigate the speciation and solubility of Fe in shallow crustal fluids (up to 400 °C and 0.1 GPa) using the autoclave developed at FAME for the study of hydrothermal fluids. X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements were conducted at the Fe K-edge using a X-ray beam of 100x200 µm and energy resolution of ∼1.3 eV. The experimental setup included an inert glassy carbon cell and berylllium windows to reduce the attenuation of X-rays through the assembly. Fe signal in the fluid was monitored both in transmission and in fluorescence geometries by using ionization chambers and a 30-elements Ge detector, respectively.</p><p>A total of 8 solubility/speciation experiments at 1 kbar and temperatures between 30 and 400 °C were conducted during the allocated beamtime. Typically, the cell was loaded with the Fe-bearing mineral assembly, either Hematite-Magnetite (HM), with or without Quartz (HMQ), or Fayalite-Magnetite-Quartz (FMQ), and an aqueous solution with various chlorine concentrations and acidity (0.5M NaCl and 0.1-0.5M HCl). After reaching the desired P-T conditions, the dissolution of the Fe-bearing minerals was monitored by the fluorescence signal of Fe in the fluid until equilibration (∼45-60 min at 250 -400 °C). Once chemical equilibrium is reached, XAS spectra were recorded in 1) transmission mode to determine the absorption edge height that is proportional to the total Fe dissolved, and in 2) fluorescence mode to extract the structural information from the near-and after-edge spectrum. In some experiments, a 0.5 M FeCl 3 aqueous solution was equilibrated with the HM buffer (with or without quartz) to investigate the stability of Fe 3+ in hydrothermal fluids.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> highlights the most important results obtained from this study. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> shows the evolution of the total dissolved Fe in acidic chlorinated fluids in equilibrium with HM or HMQ between 30 and 400 °C. The concentration of Fe in the fluid decreases above 350 °C and the decrease is more pronounced as the oxygen fugacity in the system decreases (i.e, from HM to HMQ assembly). The changes in Fe solubility are most likely related to a change in the redox state of Fe in the fluid, from Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ as temperature increases. This interpretation is consistent with the limited stability of Fe 3+ in the fluid as temperature increases demonstrated by the XANES/EXAFS spectra recorded in FeCl 3 -NaCl-HCl aqueous solutions (total chlorine content 1M) in equilibrium with the HMQ assembly (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). The speciation is dominated by Fe 3+ at low temperatures but an important fraction of Fe 2+ is identified in the fluid at the highest temperature investigated here, 300 °C. The deconvolution of the spectra to determine the exact proportions of Fe 3+ and Fe 2+ in the fluid is currently in progress. Together with the total concentration of Fe in the fluid, it will allow to evaluate the redox state of hydrothermal fluids at crustal conditions, a key parameter to understand the formation of Fe and other metal ore deposits. Nevertheless, our results already demonstrate that even though hydrothermal fluids can transport significant amounts of Fe, the capacity to transport Fe 3+ at high temperature may be very limited, even at redox conditions relevant for the present-day crust/mantle. These preliminary results have been presented as an invited contribution at the Goldschmidt Conference 2016 held in Yokohama, Japan <ref type="bibr">(Testemale et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>A manuscript presenting the results and the implications for redox state of crustal fluids and their role in the formation of metal ore deposits will be prepared during Spring 2017.</p></div>
