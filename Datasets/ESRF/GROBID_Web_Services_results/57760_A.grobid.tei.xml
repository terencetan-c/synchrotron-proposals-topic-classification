<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Here we report on our high-resolution scanning SAXS/WAX experiments at ID-13 aimed at determining the micro-structure of the spider mechano-sensors, specifically the organization and orientatin of the chitin fibers within the samples. The two common classes of external mechano-sensory systems in spiders are the strain-sensitive slit-sensilla and the hair-like sensilla which are subdivided into airflow sensitive trichobothria and tactile hairs. As part of the spider's cuticular exoskeleton, the strain-sensitive organs and the hair-like receptors consist of chitin fibers embedded within a matrix of proteins. The properties of the cuticle are dependent on the fiber orientation as well as the properties of the matrix and its hydration level. The topic of this proposal is the structure-properties relationship in spiders mechanical sensors, specifically the air flow and touch-responsive hair-selsilla. We wish to perform scanning-diffraction experiments to determine the chitin-fiber content, orientation and alignment within individual hairs and how these change along the hair shaft.We collected data from 3 mechano-sensor types: (1) Tricobothria airflow sensors (2) tactile-hair touch receptor and (3) Slits strain sensors.</p><p>Experimental Procedure</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample preparation:</head><p>The hair-like sensors (trichobothria and tactile hairs) were mechanically removed from the spider (Cupiennuius salei) and placed on a silicon-nitrid window frame. The samples were fixed to the membrane with a small drop of glue. The slits organ were prepared as sestions where the entire matatarus of the spider were disected using a vibratome while immersed in water. these sections were then either glued to similar silicon-nitrid windows as the hairs with a drop of glue or sandwiched between two frames in order to perserve their humidity level.</p><p>Measurements were performed at ID-13 at the nano-focus station (hutch 3). Thanks to the small spot size avilable at this station (200 nm) we could obtain data with high spatial resolution. The beam energy was set to 15 KeV. In addition the newly acquiered large area Eiger detector with high dinamic range used allowed us to obtain high qulity SAXS and WAX data simultanesly. Acquisition time varied between 1-1.2 sec/point depending on the sample thickness and step size was 400 nm to minimize radition damage. All together we have measured 20 from 3 slits organs, 3 trichobothria and 3 tactile hairs. In addition we have performed preliminary experiments to test the possibility of micro-mapping calcitic sea urchin spine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data evaluation:</head><p>The data obtained in these measurements is being analyzing using fit2D and DPDAK to extract (1) and estimate of the chitin content (using orthogonal chitin reflections) (2) chitin fiber orientaion (using the packing peaks of chitin at q~1.3) (3) the degree of fiber orientatino (using rho parameter analysis). The SAXS data is being analyzed for variations is slope (form factor analysis) and structure factor. In addition we are mapping the position of the (020) peak which tells about the interaction of proetins with the chitin crystllites [1].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We have obtained strucutral data with high spatial resolution for all measured samples. The results still being analyzed and point toward major role of chitin fiber orientation with relation to the samples mechanical properties. The results on the slits are being finalized to be incorporated in a publication discussing the structure-propetes of the slits in relation to their mechano-sensing function. The data on hair-like sensors is a starting point for a thorough structural, chemical and mechanical charachterization of the hairs and the cuticle in which they are embedded. An example for the analysis and information we extract from the measurements are seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> produced from data obtained during our previous measurements (SC-3434). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
