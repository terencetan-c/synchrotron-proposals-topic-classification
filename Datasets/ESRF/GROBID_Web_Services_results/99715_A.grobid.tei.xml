<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>When colloidal dispersions reach a particular concentration, usually quantified by the volume fraction, they enter in an arrested state. Depending on the inter-particle interactions these states are typically associated to a gel (attractive) or glass (repulsive) phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Even tough being very similar, and in some cases composed by the same building blocks, these two classes of materials can manifest very different macroscopic properties, e.g. the mechanical response to an external stress. The amorphous soft materials can be found in many practical applications, being relevant in several industries ranging from medical and food to optoelectronic, but the lack of a fundamental coherent picture of these phenomena means that they are often treated with ad-hoc explanations. The consequence is that the reasons that produce these dynamically arrested amorphous systems are known only qualitatively [2], and a complete understanding of the general mechanisms are still lacking. Grasping the structural origins of the dynamical arrest in disordered systems is one of the long-standing goals of condensed matter physics, which is finally on sight with new theoretical and experimental techniques. Simulations and experimental works suggest the presence of a particular intermediate range structure, visible in higher order correlation functions, that appear to be correlated with the glass formation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The experiment was performed at ID02 with 12keV in USAXS configuration. we measured samples that are able to change reversibly the interparticle potential, thus capable to switch between an arrested glass and an arrested gel structure. More in detail the samples were nanoparticles composed by a silica core and a PNIPAm shell. In total we measured 6 different samples at 4 different volume fractions ( plus diluted samples for the form factor). We carried out our measurements at 6 different temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 45 °C to observe the transition between the glasssy state (swollen PNIPAm shell) to the gel state (collapsed PNIPAm shell). We collected an XPCS measurement for each temperature to control the dynamical condition of the sample and we collected speckle patterns from all the capillary volume to obtain information of the intermediate range order via XCCA analysis. In figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> some preliminary results concerning the sole structure factor are reported for 3 samples at the same nominal concentration. The shown samples have the same thickenss of the PNIPAm shell and differ only in the amount of cross-linker, with the sample in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.a the one characterized by the least amount of cross-linker and the sample in fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.c the one with the highest.</p><p>Currently the analysis to extract the angular cross-correlations from all the collected speckle patterns for all the investigated samples is still ongoing.</p></div>
