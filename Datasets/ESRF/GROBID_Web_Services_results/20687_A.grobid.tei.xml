<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Emissions of the greenhouse gas N 2 O from nitric and adipic acid plants pose a serious environmental problem. Catalytic decomposition of N 2 O with Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts seems a very promising option to abate these emission. It has been reported that, in contrast to other materials, Fe-ZSM-5 maintains a high activity for N 2 O decomposition even in the presence of NO, O 2 and water, which are all components of a real tail gas <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We focused our EXAFS investigation on the interaction of N 2 O with the catalyst to understand the reaction mechanism of the conversion of N 2 O to N 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Fe-loaded ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by sublimation of FeCl 3 , followed by washing and calcination in O 2 . The sample was pressed into a self-supported pellet, placed in the EXAFS and subjected to a thermal treatment at 673 K in pure He or a mixture of 1000 ppm N 2 O in He. After cooling down, the Fe K edge spectra were measured in transmission mode at liquid nitrogen temperature. The data was analyzed by standard procedures using the EXAFS Data Analysis Program XDAP-Version 2.2.3.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The fourier transformed spectrum (experimental and fitted) of the sample recorded after thermal treatment in He flow at 673 K is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The data analysis of the first coordination shell, assigned to the Fe-O backscattering pair, showed that four oxygen atoms are coordinated to Fe atom at a distance of 1.92 Å.</p><p>The second, Fe-Fe shell, was found at a distance of 2.97 Å. The coordination number of 1.5 revealed the presence of very small iron clusters.</p><p>The spectrum detected after the exposure of the catalyst to N 2 O is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The Fe-O and Fe-Fe shells are determined in the spectrum. The coordination number for the first shell increased and 4.8 oxygen atoms are coordinated to the iron atom at a distance of 1.95 Å. A relatively high Debye -Waller factor obtained for this shell points to the fact that more different distances are included in this shell . This shell will be therefore further investigated to improve the quality of the fit. The iron shell at a distance of 3.01 Å and with the coordination number of 1.7 shows that small Fe clusters are still present after the exposure to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N 2 O.</formula><p>The tentative interpretation of the results is that, in the first step of N 2 O decomposition, the O from N 2 O is added to the coordination shell of the Fe site, i.e. 0 1 2 3 4 5 -2 -1 0 1 2 FT R [A] 0 1 2 3 4 5 -2 -1 0 1 FT R [A]</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1</figDesc></figure>
