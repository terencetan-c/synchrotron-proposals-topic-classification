<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In-cubo crystallization of membrane proteins has attracted a huge amount of interest recently and is driving the structure determination of many proteins which have proved difficult or impossible to crystallize by other techniques, however the mechanism of this process has remained poorly understood. While it is accepted that key to the crystallization process is mixing solubilized protein with a lipidic lyotropic cubic phase, it has been suggested in the literature that it is in fact a lamellar lipid phase that mediates crystallization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Caffrey 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Qutub, Reviakine et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cherezov and Caffrey 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In this experiment, we have explored the role of lipid lamellar phases in in-cubo crystallization by in-situ studies of crystallization. Samples of the lipid monoolein, which exhibits wide areas of bicontinuous cubic phase in its binary phase diagram, were prepared with various concentrations of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) added. In all mixtures, we have observed clear cubic phase diffraction patterns but also see coexisting additional diffraction signatures corresponding to a lamellar phase. Furthermore, by varying the concentration of bR in the mixture, the study revealed that increasing levels of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) in a monoolein crystallization matrix promoted the formation of a lamellar phase at the expense of the cubic phase, note: this was observed both before and after significant crystallization had occurred. This is a highly significant result and demonstrates that the protein component is driving a phase transition in the lipid system, not the other way round. This observation, coupled with the fact that at all times the majority of the lipid adopts cubic symmetry indicates that the lamellar phase is a side effect or marker for the crystallization process and not a driving force as previously suggested. In mixtures where bR crystals have been allowed to form (all samples older than 5 days), lamellar phases are promoted close to the crystal edges where the concentration of bR in the lipid matrix is highest. Moving away from the edge-front of a bR crystal, the bR concentration falls and the lipid adopts its equilibrium cubic phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details:</head><p>SAXS patterns were gathered at the ID02 beamline, ESRF with an X-ray energy of 17 keV (Î»=0.07514nm).</p><p>Independent samples were prepared in 3 mm diameter capillary tubes every day for 15 days prior to the experiment commencing to maximize output from the beamtime. This sequential sample preparation allowed us to effectively study the effect of crystallization time. Diffraction patterns were recorded at several different points in the sample by moving the capillary sample holder between diffraction pattern acquisitions.</p><p>High hydrostatic pressure and pressure jumps were used to evaluate the relative stability of the cubic and lamellar phases (analysis ongoing).</p><p>This work forms the basis of a manuscript which is currently in preparation.</p></div>			</div>
