<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>The molecular structure of diiodoethyl radical </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have studied the elimination reaction of 1,2-diiodoethane (C 2 H 4 I 2 ) molecule, which after photo-excitation with 267 nm photons gives a short-lived iodoethyl radical (CH 2 ICH 2 •) and iodine atom (I).</p><p>For this purpose we used a pump-probe diffractometer installed at ID09B. The photoreaction was triggered by pulses delivered from a femtosecond CPA amplifier (λ=800nm) and further converted to third harmonic (267nm, 35µJ/pulse, 1 kHz repetition rate). Before reaching the sample the pulses were stretched with silica prisms to the pulse-length of ~2ps in order to avoid multiphoton excitations. The reaction was probed with the white beam (0.45 keV bandwidth centred at 18.2 keV) produced by U17 undulator. The chromophore concentration of 60 mM was chosen to maximize the photo-prducts signal while keeping the inter-solute contributions negligible.</p><p>We collected time-resolved data for the following time-delays: -3ns, -100ps, 50ps, 100ps, 300ps, 1ns, 3ns, 10ns, 30ns, 50ns, 70ns, 100ns, 300ns, 1 µs, 3µs. The data point at -3ns served as a reference point. To recover from the diffration signal the changes due to photo-excitation, difference signal (∆S) was generated by subtracting the reference data at -3ns from the data at each time-point. For C 2 H 4 I 2 in polar methanol, we extracted laserinduced signal to high precision through numerous repetitions. We also obtained preliminary data for C 2 H 4 I 2 in non-polar cyclohexane. The figure below shows the difference signal as a function of time delays in both methanol and cyclohexane. The ∆S(q) was multiplied by q and its sine-Fourier transform, ∆S(r), was multiplied by r to magnify the intensity at high q and r, repectively. Inspecting the figure, one can see that difference patterns at low q are markedly different in methanol and cyclohexane, whereas at high q they are nearly identical, i.e. independent of the solvent.</p><p>In the real space, the negative peak near 5 Å is due to the depletion of the I..I internuclear distance in C 2 H 4 I 2 . This feature would be common for all reaction channels potentially taking place. However, the peaks between 1 Å and 3 Å are sensitive to the position of the I atom relative to the two carbon centres. It is expected from the theory that the bridged structure will give only one peak in this region while the classical anti structure will give two peaks. Looking at the measured 100ps curves on figures C and E, it is clear that we have observed the bridged radical in both solvents. Another, unexpected, feature emerges with time. On the nanosecond time scale a new peak apperas at 2.7 Å. This feature corresponds to the I-I disntance of the nascent I 2 molecule. This process seems to be solvent independent too.</p><p>We also note that the low q data contains information about the structural change in the solvent. The peaks and valeys above 6 Å in figures C and E contain important information about the response of the solvent cage to the solute excitation, and of the bulk solvent to the energy released by relaxing solutes. To fully explore solvent dynamics, apparent temporal evolution of peaks and valleys at long distances (r &gt; 6 Å), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be necessary. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Maciej Lorenc (*), ESRF, Grenoble, France Hyotcherl Ihee (*), Department of Chemistry and School of Molecular Science, KAIST, Deajeon, Republic of Korea Michael Wulff (*), ESRF, Grenoble, France</figDesc></figure>
