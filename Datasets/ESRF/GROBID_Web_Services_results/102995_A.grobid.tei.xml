<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Assessment of the influence of manufacturing-and doping-induced stress on the performance of press-fit rectifier diodes by in situ GIXRD experiments Press-fit rectifier diodes commonly employed in the automotive field endure different effects during their performance (heating, mechanical stress…). These factors affect the behavior of the device (mainly the semiconductor component) to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the characteristics of the diode (technology, design…). As they usually occur simultaneously, the separate assessment of each one is complex.</p><p>Thus, the aim of the proposal was to study the influence of stress on the crystal structure of Si wafers whose characteristics, in terms of dimensions and doping level, are similar to those embedded in the diodes. This allowed us to evaluate the stress phenomenon separately from other effects to which the semiconductor component of diodes is subjected.</p><p>For that, several single-crystal (110) Si wafers implanted with different concentration levels of B were studied in situ by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) under the application of mechanical stress. Experiments were performed at the BM25-SpLine beamline at The ESRF (Grenoble, France) at an energy of 18 keV. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the samples evaluated in the experiment. After the implantation, wafers were subjected to a thermal treatment that helps doping atoms to place in active sites of the lattice.  The wafer, with a surface of 5 x 5 mm 2 and a thickness of 520 μm, was placed in the sample hole of the microtensile test device (Deben), which was coupled to the stage of the SCXRD system. Then, an increasing uniaxial compressive force is remotely applied from 0 to 110 N in steps of 10 N. Spectra were taken each time the force was increased and after stabilizing the system for ca. 5 min. In addition, reciprocal space maps (RSM) were performed in order to elucidate the presence of strain or other effects at the interfaces.   Detector Synchrotron beam Microtensile test device (a) Si wafer (b)</p><p>towards higher 2θ values. Since the B atomic radius is lower than that of Si, the structure of the sample may be compressing. These results will enable us to perform a calibration curve. This experiment enabled to isolate the stress and doping contribution from other effects that diodes endure, and which were evaluated in previous experiments. The deconvolution of the different effects provides a better insight into the behavior of press-fit rectifier diodes, which is useful for increasing their lifetime and diminishing costs.</p></div>
