<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>NbO2F adopts the ReO3-type structure which offers vibrational flexibility due to corner-sharing octahedra. This structure commonly exhibits low-or negative-thermal expansion (NTE) due to these vibrations which lead to a net reduction in volume during heating. NbO2F itself exhibits positive thermal expansion which appears to approach a maximum near to room temperature., in contrast to TaO2F which exhibits near-zero thermal expansion, despite having very similar unit cell parameters and ionic radii.</p><p>Another feature of the ReO3 structure, also linked with octahedral flexibility, is that it often transforms to a rhombohedral polymorph under moderate pressures (0.7 GPa and 0.4 GPa for TaO2F and NbO2F, respectively 1,2 ). These two effects compete with each other in some way, such that NTE requires volumereducing vibrations to be substantial at moderate temperatures, but not so prevalent that the structure is more stable in a rhombohedral phase.</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to measure the thermal expansion and phase transition behaviour of NbO2F under varying pressure and temperature conditions in order to determine how these two effects interact throughout the temperature/pressure phase diagram. During the experiment, it was also possible to measure an additional fluorine-doped sample (NbO1.9F1.1) for comparison.</p><p>Technical limitations around maintaining a relatively low pressure (&lt; 1 GPa) while changing temperature meant that it was experimentally challenging to access all of the P/T points originally proposed, and it was not possible to measure different temperatures at identical pressures. The phase transition into the rhombohedral phase was also kinetically slow at these temperatures, meaning that a coexistence of rhombohedral and cubic phases was frequently observed. Despite these challenges, however, using careful diffraction analysis using Pawley and Rietveld fitting we were able to determine the evolution of the phase transition with temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Our results find that in both NbO2F and NbO1.9F1.1 the transition to a rhombohedral phase occurs with pressure, but this critical pressure is lower for the NbO2F sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). On cooling, this critical pressure drops for both materials. For NbO2F we find evidence for the formation of a rhombohedral phase on cooling which has not previously been observed; neutron diffraction experiments are scheduled to investigate this subtle effect further. For the fluorine-doped sample, we see no evidence of a transition down to the lowest temperature measured (30 K).</p><p>Based on the temperature/pressure points measured, we were able to fit a combined temperature-pressurevolume equation of state (Fei-type thermal dependence and second order Birch-Murnaghan pressure dependence, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The results for the two compositions look very similar (within error) except for the thermal expansion terms α0 and α1 (the linear and quadratic temperature coefficients relative to 280 K). NbO2F has a larger linear dependence on temperature, which is consistent with a more positive thermal expansion behaviour. Interestingly, however, the quadratic terms (α1) show opposite signs for each composition. A positive α1 term could be important in understanding the origin of NTE in ReO3-type materials, therefore computational modelling is on-going to better understand this behaviour. The results obtained from this experiment have demonstrated that NbO2F-like materials become more likely to undergo a transition to a rhombohedral phase upon cooling. In particular, work is on-going to investigate a previously unseen temperature-driven transition in NbO2F. Fluorine substitution in NbO2F appears to increase this transition pressure as well as reducing its temperature sensitivity.</p><p>These results are currently underpinning a larger study on the thermal expansion behaviour in fluorine-doped NbO2F materials. Currently these results have been presented at peer-reviewed conferences (IUCR, ISNTE) but we expect they will form the basis of one or more publications in this area shortly.</p><p>[1] <ref type="bibr">Carlson, S. et al., Acta Cryst.
