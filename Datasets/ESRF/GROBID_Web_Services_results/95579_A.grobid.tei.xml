<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study of dynamic charge-density-wave correlations in HgBa2CuO4+d</head><p>This experiment was a follow up to HC-3030, in which we also used ID32 to measure charge-density-wave correlations in HgBa2CuO4+δ (Hg1201). In that previous experiment, dynamic CDW correlations were observed above the doping dependent CDW short-range-ordering temperature TCDW <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Our follow-up experiment extended that work to additional temperatures, and to additional samples at other oxygen doping levels, namely a lightly-underdoped sample with superconducting Tc = 80 K and TCDW ≈ 150 K, and an optimally-doped sample with superconducting Tc = 95 K and no static CDW order. RIXS measurements were performed in dependence on temperature and momentum transfer on both samples using a σ-polarized scattering geometry. We observed the expected static short-range CDW order below TCDW in the lightlyunderdoped sample (Fig. <ref type="figure">A</ref>), as well as a dynamic mode that potentially emanates from qCDW and disperses toward the Brillioun zone boundary at ~ 50 meV. This mode was actually visible in our data from HC-3030, however, the improved quality of the new data reveals it more clearly. This mode is also visible in the absence of static correlations, above TCDW (Fig. <ref type="figure">B</ref>). Notably, it is also observed in the optimally-doped sample which does not display static CDW order, both at low and high temperatures (Figs. C, D). A detailed analysis of these data is still ongoing. </p></div>
