<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The powder X-Ray diffraction measurement of zeolite ITQ-28 in the calcined and in the asprepred forms were carried out as planned. However, due to the extremelly large volume and low symmetry of the unit cell a strong peak overlapping was observed even at very low 2θ angles. Attempts to overcome this problem were performed by carrying out the measurement of the X-Ray diffraction patterns at different temperatures with the aim of solve some X-Ray diffractions if there is any anysotropy in the unit cell expansion upon heating. Additionally, our local contact, Dr.a Irene Margiolaki, has collected X-Ray diffraction data at higher wavelength trying to improve the resolution of the X-ray peaks. At the moment even after all this work, all the attempts of indexing the X-Ray pattern of ITQ-28 zeolite have failed. At the moment, we are working in the indexation of the different patterns collected in this beam allocation and also, we are attempting to synthesise larger and better crystals of ITQ-28 that could allow its measurement by single-crystal microdiffraction technique.</p><p>Additionally to the scheduled work on ITQ-28, we carried out some experiments (which were completed during experiment CH-1859) on a different zeolite, named ITQ-32. Two patterns were collected, one for the as-prepared solid and the second for the calcined material. With these two patterns and by applying a new methodology for solving complex crystal structures by direct methods, the structure was succesfully solved. Two papers have been submitted. A paper entitled 'Solving centrosymetrycal zeolites from powder diffraction data by combining the direct methods origin-free modulus sum function with the isomorphous replacement technique.X." in which our local contact is one of the authors has been sent to Journal of Applied Crysallography.</p><p>A second paper entitled 'Synthesis and Structure of the Bidimensional Zeolite ITQ-32 with Small and Large Pores' has been accepted for publication in Journal American Chemical Society.</p><p>The abstract of the accepted paper is as follows: 'A new bidimensional zeolite containing 8R and 12R pores, denoted as ITQ-32, has been synthesized and its strcuture solved from powder X-Ray diffraction data. This zeolite presents a relatively large pore volume (0.16 cm 3 /g) and pore apertures of 3.5 x 4.3 Å and can be prepared as nearly pure silica zeolite and as aluminosilicate. In the latest case, acidic properties are developed.' A copy of this publication will be submitted to the ESRF when published in the Journal.</p></div>		</body>
