<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5HSRUW</head><p>These experiments are part of an extensive study using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments to gain a better understanding of interactions in mixed valent rare earths such as Ce. During this session we studied the Ce / 3 -edge RIXS in CeSi x and also CeFe 2 . All samples were well defined arc-melted bulk alloys. CeSi x is γ-Ce like, Ce Fe 2 is α-like. CeSi x has attracted particular interest in recent years because the interpretation of very high resolution photoemission spectroscopy (PES) experiments has proved to be controversial (see <ref type="bibr">Garnier et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. , 4127, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">and Arko and Joyce Phys. Rev. Lett. , 1348</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1998)</ref>. According to Baer and co-workers the Kondo resonance predicted by the Anderson impurity model is intercepted by E F . So that the resonance shows-up as a small structure just below E F in the PES data and as a marked peak above E F in inverse PES (IPES). The indications are that, in CeSi x , the Kondo temperature decreases as x decreases. This would explain the decrease in intensity of both the PES and IPES 4 I 1 peak at E F with decreasing x and corresponds to a decrease in the 4I-conduction band hybridization (reduced 4 I 0 contribution in the groung state). Not only does the pre-absorption edge RIXS (Raman regime) show strong differences between the α-like and γ-like alloys as we would expect (see figure), but we also observe striking differences in the spectra for x=2 compared to x=1.7 in CeSi x . Furthermore we also note differences in the spectra as a function of temperature (the experiments were performed at 300 K and 15 K).</p><p>Unfortunately some instabilities in the beam during our experimental period due to a storage ring feedback amplifier place the temperature effects very close to the experimental limits and so require confirmation. (The experiments could not be repeated on a sufficiently short time scale because of the cooling down-warming up cycle). The other changes observed are well within the experimental limits. The main peak (886.1 eV energy transfer) corresponds to a dipole transition to the 5d6s conduction band. The excitation in the pre-edge region produces two resonances in CeSi x (880 eV and 882.5 eV) but one only may be distinguished in CeFe 2 (880 eV). The 880 eV structure is clearly reinforced relative to the 5d6s peak in CeFe 2 compared to CeSi x It is the result of 4I-conduction band hybridization leading to three final states. (We also observe a higher energy resonance in CeFe 2 at 895 eV. This is not shown in the figure). These may be labeled I 0 , I 1 , and I 2 according to the configuration that contributes most weight to each peak. We deduce from the relative intensities that the I 2 -related peak at 880 eV in CeFe 2 contains a significant contribution from dipole terms. The weight of the 880 eV and 882.5 eV features in CeSi 1.7 relative to that of the main I 1 peak is 30% smaller than in CeSi 2 . Here again the explanation must be found in the degree of interaction between the possible final states. To a first approximation, we can normalize data for both concentrations to the I 1 peak. If hybridization could be neglected between the various final states, the I 2 peak would have to be attributed to a quadrupole transition to the intermediate state only. The weight of the I 2 peak would then increase slightly (higher 4 I 1 count in the ground state) in CeSi 1.7 , not decrease by 30%. We are presently working on a quantitative interpretation of the data.</p><p>)LJXUH Ce L 3 RIXS for CeSi 2 (left panel) and Ce Fe 2 (right panel) taken at 15 K and plotted on an energy transfer scale.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>1DPHV DQG DIILOLDWLRQV RI DSSOLFDQWV (* indicates experimentalists): &amp;) +DJXH -0 0DULRW / -RXUQHO --*DOOHW /DERUDWRLUH GH &amp;KLPLH 3K\VLTXH0DWLqUH HW 5D\RQQHPHQW 805 8QLYHUVLWp 3 HW 0 &amp;XULH 3DULV DQG * .ULOO DQG -3 .DSSOHU /85( 2UVD\</figDesc></figure>
