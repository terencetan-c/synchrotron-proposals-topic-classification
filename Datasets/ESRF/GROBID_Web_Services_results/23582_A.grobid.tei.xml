<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiments was to utilize the coherence properties of a third generation synchrotron source to study the properties of the in-line holographic technique in terms of sensitivity, geometrical requirements and energy. Images of nylon, aluminum and copper cylindrical wires from 50 µm to 240 µm in diameter were recorded onto a FRELON camera developed at ESRF using an optical resolution of 1.8 µm. An analytical model based on geometrical optics was developped which gives a good prediction of the contrast enhancement effects and allowed the estimation of the fringes' frequency, the phase contrast amplitude and the measure of the refraction index from the wires images. A comparison of the images with the Fresnel diffraction theory proved the adequacy of the analytical model with experimental data. A nylon fiber was investigated in air, water and oil to study the effect of the relative electronic density on the edge enhancement effects. In order to demonstrate the potential of phase-contrast effects on biological tissue samples, phase contrast images of a pork kidney have also been produced at various distances between the object to be imaged and the detector.</p></div>

It was convoluted with the frequency response of the camera and the projected source distribution modelised by a Gaussian function. A sharp edge of 200 µm thick of tungsten placed perpendicularly to the beam was utilized to determine the frequency response (MTF) of the camera for each energy utilized. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the agreement between numerical simulations of the wire and the experimental results (black: numerical simulations from Fresnel theory / red: experimental results). A model developed on the basis of geometrical optics allowed to analyze the interference fringes comportment and the associated phase contrast.

The results for 5 defocalising distances between 0.2 to 1.8 m gave the mean values d = 1.05 . 10 -6 and d = 1.07 . 10 -6 respectively for the nylon fibers with the diameters of 74 and 240 µm.

The expected linear dependance of phase contrast level with the refractive index was investigated with images of a nylon wire in air, water and oil. Experimental results show a good linear correlation coefficient (fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>Phase contrast images of a pork kidney were recorded at 20 keV. To avoid air/tissue interfaces, the sample was immersed in a physiological liquid before acquisitions. The effects of phase modulations reveal an important improvement of small structures visibility due to edge enhancement. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Fig. 3 :</head><label>13</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Nylon wire (ø 74 µm) at 15 keV and 0.9 m Figure 2: Comparison between the analytical model (red) and Fresnel diffraction theory (black) 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0</figDesc></figure>
