<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Serpentinites forming in subduction zone environments present a major sink for fluid-mobile elements at depth [1-3]. Because of the experimental challenges, which include the low elemental concentrations and the generation of high P/T conditions, our knowledge on how these elements are absorbed, transported and released at depth, during the formation and stepwise breakdown of serpentine is mainly based on field observations and ex-situ fluid inclusion studies [4,5].</p><p>We have conducted experiments on the EXAFS beamline BM23 of the ESRF to study the uptake of the fluid mobile elements during serpentine formation, which complemented our previous results on nickel (ES 494 and report). We have focused in the present experiments on the elements Bromine, Rubidium and Strontium (Br, Rb, Sr). For the experiments, the X-ray beam was tuned to the energy of the K-edges of these elements (13.4737, 15.1997 and 16.115 keV) using a double-crystal fixed exit monochromator equipped with two Si(111) crystals. Beam focusing to 6 × 6 μm 2 and harmonic rejection was achieved through a Kirkpatrick Baez mirror system with Pt coating inclined to 4 mrad. EXAFS and XRF measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode using a Si SDD Vortex detector in backscattering geometry (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We have refined the present setup in adding a poly-capillary collimator on the fluorescence detector which allowed to improved significantly the signal-to-noise ratio in this geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[6]</ref>. To generate the high pressure and temperature conditions we used an externally heated diamond anvil cell (eRH-DAC) developed at the ESRF-sample environment that allows fine controlling of these parameters. The DAC was equipped with two full nano-polycrystalline diamonds. XRD data were acquired at 18 keV and a distance of 192 mm from the sample using a MAR164 CCD detector. XRF, XANES and XRD data were acquired at the target pressure and temperature (250 °C and 0.3 GPa) of serpentine formation in timesteps of 10 minutes to track variation of Sr concentration in the fluid and the newly formed phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1.</head><p>Experimental setup installed at BM23 to study the element uptake during serpentine formation in-situ at high pressure and temperature conditions. The X-ray beam is focused by the KB-system (right side). The sample was loaded in a diamond anvil cell contained in a vacuum chamber (centre). XRF data were are acquired in backscattered geometry using a Vortex detector equipped with a polycapillary. In addition XRD, Raman and XAS data were acquired in transmission geometry (left side).</p><p>The starting material consisted of a crystal of forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and/or enstatite (MgSiO3) loaded together with a ruby crystal and either a NaBr, RbCl2 or SrCl2 solution containing 0.5 m NaCl and 2500 ppm of either Br, Rb or Sr. The solutions were prepared at the ESRF chemistry lab by H. Mueller in nitrogen atmosphere to avoid moister contamination. The sample pressure and temperature was than raised to 0.3 GPa and a 250 °C and held constant for more than 14 hours. Serpentine formation reaction kinetics are very sluggish but are enhanced by aluminium from one week to 36 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[7]</ref>. We therefore added several spheres of Al2O3 in the sample chamber that dissolved at this conditions in the fluid and therefore accelerated the reaction.</p><p>We have conducted four experiments in total. In a first run we observed the absorption of Sr in the newly formed serpentine crystals three hours after P/T stabilization (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We conducted a second run on Sr-doped fluid loaded together with enstatite only. In this experiment we did not observe a reaction to serpentine at this conditions, which confirms field observations. In the experiments with Br-doped solutions a reaction between the fluid and crystal took place that induced the dissolution of forsterite. This unwanted chemical reaction suggests that Br at such concentrations leads to high fluid acidity which is inhibiting further experiments on Br doped solutions. In a third experiment Rb-doped solutions were employed. We encounter however a pressure drop during temperature stabilization, which lead to a formation of a gas bubble in the sample, inhibiting any further measurements. The present experiments remain very challenging as they involve a fluid phase with not yet fully constrained chemical properties at the target P/T conditions. In addition, the experiments require relatively low pressures but high temperatures. Upon heating the metallic gasket material may deform and plastically flow which may lead to its thinning and therefore to the opening of the cell and fluid loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Top-view on the samples contained in the Re-gasket through the diamonds at high pressure and before heating (left) and at the target P/T conditions (centre). Note, the formation of new crystals in the sample, which we identified as the serpentine variety lizardite from SEM and XRD. Figure on the right side shows XRF spectra taken in the fluid after 3 hours (pink) and compared to standard measurements (dark blue).</head><p>To complement the in-situ runs we performed additionally XANES measurements on the recovered Sr-bearing serpentine samples that have been picked from the cell after quenching and fluid release. Post-mortem FEG-SEM analysis of these quenched samples revealed that the serpentine variety lizardite formed at the experimental conditions which is consistent with the in-situ XRD data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>). The data on Sr uptake from newly formed serpentine have now been analysed. The XRF data revealed a minor uptake of Sr into serpentine of only 330 ppm. This is in stark contrast to our previous observations on Ni-uptake by serpentine (ES 494 and report) and suggest that Sr is an incompatible element in serpentine. The analysis of Sr-XANES spectra on quenched samples using full multiple scattering calculations suggested further that Sr is contained in serpentine as an intergrade SrO phase instead of being structurally incorporation into the lizardite crystal lattice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). The new results on Sr obtained in the present experiment and those previously acquired on Ni, allow constraining the solubility of these element in serpentine and their incorporation mechanisms. These are key parameters to understand fluid element cycling in subduction zones. The results of these two experiments (ES-494 and ES-706) are currently compiled in a manuscript that will be submitted to the journal Chemical Geology within the next months.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.
