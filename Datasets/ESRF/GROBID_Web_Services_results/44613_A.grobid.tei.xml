<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Temporary report</head><p>During this experiment we have elaborated in situ at BM32 beamline a layered system by growing ~3 nm of CoO on an ultra-thin (about 1.5 nm thick) PtFe layer on Pt(001). The PtFe layer is chemically ordered with the tetragonal c axis perpendicular to the surface and in coherent epitaxy. The average c/a ratio is about 0.93, smaller then the bulk value (0.96). The oxide structure corresponds in a first approximation to a CoO(111) film. A deeper structural study reveals a clear monoclinic distortion. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows how the CoO(111) and Pt(001) structure could match at the interface. Four of this domains are observed in diffraction owing to the symmetry of the substrate. Due to the anisotropic stress, the induced strain on the AFM film results in a slightly distorted cubic structure, which is then described by a</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Top view</head><p>Side view monoclinic cell (space group C2/m) like the bulk CoO low temperature phase. This distortion is clearly evidenced by the comparison between the experimental (-1 0) and the (0 1) rods of the hexagonal surface cell, which are equivalent in the cubic and non-equivalent in the monoclinic structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This experimental observation correspond to the fact that the c axis for the hexagonal surface cell is no more perpendicular to the surface. Such a distortion observed at room temperature is of the same order of magnitude as the one of the low temperature bulk phase. However, the monoclinic bc-plane results compressed instead of expanded. This difference would possibly give rise to a modification on the antiferromagnetic behavior of the layer. The system shows perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and exchange bias after field cooling from room temperature.</p><p>The results of this experiment have been presented at the ECOSS-28 conference, Wroclaw, 28 August-2 September 2011.</p><p>3.5 3.4 3.3 (-1 0) (0 1) monoclinic cubic |F| (Arb. units) Q z (Å -1 )</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Schematic top view (a) and side view (b) of the match at the interface between CoO(111) and Pt(001).</figDesc><graphic coords="2,204.70,595.90,164.90,131.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
