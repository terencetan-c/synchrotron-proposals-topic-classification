<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The principal aim of this experiment was to study the incorporation of III-element cations coming from the substrate or a GaN buffer layer into ZnO thin films.To this end, the samples studied were nominally undoped 5 µm thick (0001) ZnO layer grown on a 1 µm (0001) GaN buffer layer deposited by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy on sapphire at different temperatures. Moreover, a 20mm thick ZnO layer was deposited directly on a sapphire substrate at high temperature to validate the origin of the incorporation (Al or Ga). The growth time and temperature were varied to change the quantity of III-element cations incorporated into ZnO film. Further information about the growth parameters and optical, electrical and structural properties were published on Ref. 1. Involuntary doping of samples can introduce undesired results in the manufacture of thin films-based optoelectronic devices. Indeed, the incorporation of Al into ZnO coming from sapphire substrate has recently triggered the attention of several studies <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. Cathodoluminescence measurements along the interfaces of ZnO-GaN-Al2O3 showed a redshift of the photoluminescence peak as the excitation area approaches the ZnO/GaN interface <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Their origin could be clarified scanning the chemical composition along the interface. The wavelength dispersive spectrometer of the ID21 beamline employs the polycapillary x-ray optic for efficient x-ray collection and is operated in the flat-crystal geometry. In the present experiment, the x-ray fluorescence delivered by the polycapillary was diffracted on the TlAP(001) (2d=25.9 Ǻ) crystal and recorded with the gas proportional counter. The achieved overall spectral resolution was about 20eV in the energy range between 1keV to 1.5keV. The high-resolution of detection was necessary in order to resolve unequivocally the overlapping x-ray fluorescence lines of Zn, Ga and Al. Piezoelectric sample stage was used to scan the chemical distribution along the interfaces.</p><p>Al diffusion was considered responsible for the changes in the structural and optical properties close to the interface and it was demonstrated the effect of the growth temperature on the amount of Al diffused. In the sample grown without buffer layer, it is possible to observe the formation of an intermediate zone where there is a mix of the signals coming from the Zn and Al (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The complete XRF spectrum at different zones of the sample (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) allows concluding that the diffusion of Al dominates in these samples.</p><p>The inclusion of GaN buffer layer was used not only to reduce the lattice mismatch between the substrate and ZnO, but also to try to avoid the Al diffusion. Nevertheless, the results 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 Al Kβ Al Kα Zn Lβ Zn Lα Intensity (counts) hν (keV) ZnO Interface Sapphire Figure 2. XRF spectra taken in the ZnO, around the interface and into the sapphire.</p><p>obtained showed that Al is diffused along the buffer layer achieving the ZnO layer. In this case, the effect of the temperature on the amount of Al incorporated is a crucial parameter. Indeed, for samples grown at low temperature, it is possible to observe an overlaping of the signals, obtained by the multiplication amongst them, which reveals sharp edges around the interfaces ZnO/GaN and GaN/Al 2 O 3 . This result indicates the Al diffusion is very low, although non-nenglegible. With the increase of the growth temperature, samples exhibited the creation of a diffusion zone corresponding to the way that Al is incorporated into the GaN buffer layer and into the ZnO. In conclusion, the basic hypothesis of the proposal seems to be confirmed by the experiment. Many spectra recorded during the experiment are still being interpreted. Nevertheless, further investigations around the way that Al incorporates to the GaN and ZnO (interstitial, substitutional, forming a new crystalline phase…etc) is required to understand this fact.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a) Spatial distribution of fluorescence signals of Zn (red) and Al (green) around the interface. b) Map of Zn×Al signals</figDesc><graphic coords="3,306.60,117.00,180.00,207.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
