<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>BACKGROUND. The RE 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 family is a fascinating group of compounds which includes an unusual number of polymorph materials with optical, ferroelastic-ferroelectric and electric transport properties which make them useful in diverse technological fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This rich polymorphism is also made evident under changes of pressure and temperature. No less than ten different crystal structures are known to exist for these compounds from room temperature to their respective melting points, and from 0 GPa to their pressure induced amorphization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This makes them unique as flexible structures, and their study may help to develop new concepts about the physics of phase transitions and amorphization processes under high pressures, as well as related physical properties. At room temperature, and depending on the ionic radii and the synthesis conditions, all the known structures of this family belong to three different polytypes without any symmetry relation among them: the so called "modulated scheelites" for lighter rare earths (La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 [3] and α-Eu 2 (WO4)3 phases [4]), "ferroelectric-paraelectric phases" for RE with intermediate ionic radii (β'-Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and β-Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , respectively [5]), and "negative thermal expansion phases" (γ-Sc 2 (WO 4 ) 3 phase [6]) for the heavier RE. We are interested in completing the phase diagram (ionic radii-temperaturepressure) given by Bixner for this family [1] and clarifying the role of the thermal treatment (used in the sample preparation) in the sequence of phase transitions and reversibility observed by monitoring (using XRD in polycrystalline samples) their solid state reaction and following several heating and cooling thermal cycles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>EXPERIMENTAL. Samples were measured in the BM25A (ESRF, Grenoble). We established a compromise between obtaining a good resolution (angular range was measured between 2θ=4º to 15 or 30º), maximizing the number of diffractograms at different temperatures and providing enough time for the measurement of each diffractogram; Therefore the heating rate was not too fast (between 3ºC/min and 10ºC/min, excluding the quenching and each diffractogram was measured during ~15 minutes). As it can be seen, all samples could not be measured in the same conditions due to the short time, in total, around 100 diffractograms were measured. The wavelength (0.6502 Angstroms) was obtained by verifying the calibrated values with reference to the Si {111} lattice spacing. The temperature was calibrated from 25ºC to 1000ºC collecting data each 100ºC, in a heating process, by using a hot gas blower. Quartz glass capillary with 0.3 mm in diameter was filled with the polycrystalline reference standard of Si. The peak 111 was selected between 2θ=11.8 and 12.0º. Starting samples were the MoO 3 and RE 2 O 3 (RE=Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy and Ho) oxides in order to complete the solid state reaction of most of the rare earth trimolibdates. Note that starting oxides for the synthesis of Pr 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Tb 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , which belong to this series of lanthanides, do not have the same stoichiometry, thus, these compounds were not studied. Similar experimental conditions to the standard reference were used for our sample. The experiment consisted in a first heating process where the reaction occurred, until around 1000ºC. After that, a cooling process and several new cycles of heating and cooling were measured, in order to determine the complete sequence of phase transitions. Below, we detail the programming of measurements for 12 shifts: 23/07/2015 (08:00) -27/07/2015 (08:00).</p><p>-From 23 to 24/07/2015: 1) Standard calibration. 2) Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 solid state reaction: heating process (3ºC/min) from room temperature to 900ºC, around 40 diffractograms were measured. An important temperature gradient was detected, these diffractograms shown several phases collected at different temperatures. The hot air blower area for the sample was increased and the problem was solved. 3) Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 cooling-heating cycle (10ºC/min): 900-736-654-736-900ºC. 4) Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 quenching from 900ºC to 25ºC.</p><p>-From 24 to 25/07/2015: 1) Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was measured at 572ºC, 654ºC and 695ºC (heating rate: 10ºC/min). 2) Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 solid state reaction: heating process (3ºC/min) from room temperature to 900ºC, around 30 diffractograms were measured. 3) Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 cooling-heating cycle (10ºC/min): 900-572-900ºC, around 10 diffractograms were measured. 4) Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 quenching from 25ºC to 900ºC. 5) Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was measured at 572ºC, 645ºC, 695ºC and 25ºC using a heating and cooling rate of 10ºC/min. -From 25 to 26/07/2015: 1) Dy 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was measured at 25ºC, 900ºC and at 25ºC using a heating and a cooling rate of 10ºC/min. 2) Ho 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was measured at 900ºC after a very fast heating, after that it was measured two times at 900ºC waiting for 15 minutes between both measures. 3) Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 solid state reaction: heating process (10ºC/min) from room temperature to 900ºC, around 5 diffractograms were measured. 4) Quenching from 900ºC to 25ºC. 5) Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was measured at 400ºC, 550ºC, 700ºC and 800ºC with a heating rate of 10º/min. -From 26 to 27/07/2015: 1) Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was heating from room temperature to 675ºC (10ºC/min) and a diffractogram was measured at this temperature, these measurements correspond to the so-called "repeated experiment". 2) Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 solid state reaction: heating process (10ºC/min) from room temperature to 900ºC, around 15 diffractograms were measured. 3) Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , the temperature was decreased from 900ºC to 25ºC with a cooling rate of 10ºC/min. Diffractograms were measured at 900ºC, 818ºC, 695ºC, 450ºC and at 25ºC. 4) Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , starting from the alpha-phase at room temperature. The temperature was increased with a heating rate of 5º/min until 900ºC, 6 diffractograms were measured. 5) Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 was cooled at the same rate until 25ºC, 6 diffractograms were measured. 4) and 5) correspond to the so called "last experiment".</p></div>

In pink is represented the αphase after the third heating. The solid state reaction and the α-β phase transition is similar in Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , however we could not visualize the α phase in the following cooling-heating cycles. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we show the "last experiment" performed for Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , starting from the phase alpha (in red), reaching the β-phase at 900ºC (in olive). After cooling, at 490ºC (in green) it is possible to detect some peaks belonging to the α-phase which are kept at room temperature (in pink). The Le Bail refinements were performed with JANA [8] in order to confirm the pure phases of modulated scheelites: La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 for Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and α-Eu 2 (WO 4 ) 3 for Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Selected ferroelectric β'-phases at room temperature and paraelectric β-phase at 900ºC were refined for all compounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Observed data are in black, calculated data are in red and differences are the lower trace, in blue. Bars in green indicate de Bragg positions. Moreover we have refined by the Le Bail algorithm some diffractograms in order to detect mixed phases during the solid state reaction or during the thermal cycles. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> (left), we show the mix of α and βphases obtained at room temperature for Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 in the so-called "last experiment". These last data were collected by decreasing the heating rate because, following the same protocol used for Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 , the α-β and β-α phase transitions were not detected. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> (right) it is shown the mix of La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and α-phases, collected in the so-called "repeated experiment". These measurements were performed because, during the first solid state reaction, a gradient of temperature on the sample let to many mixed phases in each diffractogram, including the starting oxides; thus, we could not distinguish both modulated scheelite phases. RESULTS. The La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 phase and the α-phase are formed around 800ºC for Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and for Sm, Eu and Gd trimolybdates respectively. It is observed that these modulated scheelites are obtained at high temperature when the ionic radius of the lanthanide is increased. This is a result predicted by some authors but the solid state reactions have never been monitored by X ray diffraction. The La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 -β and α-β transitions undergo before 850ºC, as it can be observed from the diagram of phases given by Bixer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. During the first cooling, the β-α and β-La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 phase transitions were detected for Sm 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 respectively at around 700ºC. Also, during the first heating, the α-β and La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 -β phase transition were detected at the same temperature. These reversible transitions, without an appreciable thermal hysteresis, have been observed for the first time. This is an important result because the β and modulated scheelite phases are not related by symmetry, thus, a non-abrupt first order phase transition occurs. For Eu 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 the same result is expected but the heating and cooling rate must be slower and the transition temperature decreases. An important result, which has never been described, was the β-α (or La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 ) transition undergoing around 700ºC, when the β-phase was obtained by quenching from 900ºC to room temperature and the temperature was increased. Nd trimolybdate could be refined, using the Le Bail algorithm, with the modulated scheelite structure (La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 structure, C2/c space group) with different ordering of RE and stoichiometric vacancies than that of the Sm, Eu, Gd trimolybdates, which could be refined with the so-called α-phase (with the Eu 2 (WO 4 ) 3 structure and also the C2/c space group, but with a volume three times smaller). For all compounds, the tetragonal paraelectric phase of Gd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 (β-phase) at high temperature (P 2 1 m space group) and the ferroelectric phase (β'-phase) at room temperature (Pba2 space group) could be refined too. Another important result was the detection of a mixture of the phases α and La 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 for the Nd 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 during the solid state reaction ("repeated experiment"). This can be connected with the incommensurable phase observed for Pr 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. Finally, as it was expected, the αphase was not detected for Ho 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 and we had no time to study the γ-β and β-γ phase transition, in order to complete our recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
