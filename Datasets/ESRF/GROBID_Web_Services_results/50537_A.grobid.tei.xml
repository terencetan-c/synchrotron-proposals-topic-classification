<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Background and motivation</head><p>The objectives of the ThermoMag Integrated Project within the EU 7th Framework Program is to develop and deliver new energy harvesting thermoelectric (TE) materials based on 3D nano-structured bulk Mg 2 Si solid solutions.</p><p>The goal of experiments at ESRF was to determine the importance of doping versus microstructure versus temperature when compared to the evolution of the TE properties. One of the perspective routes to increase figure of merit of thermoelectric materials is a doping and co-doping with small quantities of additional elements to alter band structures, as well as purposely shifting the peak figure of merit temperature by changing doping concentrations. To understand the nature of the doping influence on the properties it is important to understand the doping distribution in Mg 2 Si lattice, besides that investigation of high temperature phase transformations, including the doping atoms behavior is of high importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head><p>Twelve samples were measured during the experiment, five of them with the in-situ heating up to 600 °C and cooling. For the high temperature experiments the capillaries with the powder samples were prepared under the He atmosphere, heating up the samples was provided by hot air blower.</p><p>Analysis of Mg 2 (Si-Sn) samples with small amounts of Sb doping have show the presence of multiple solid solution phases with different silicon-tin ratios (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Despite nominal composition of the samples declares 0.4/0.6 silicon-tin ratio, it was established that the main phase (~70%) has it as 0.3/0.7 respectively. Whereas the samples with a high amount of tin in the composition have shown the highest thermoelectric properties a problem of their phase stability arise after the analysis. The samples of almost the same composition produced recently contained 4 solid solution phases, the same time those which were produced a while before had already 6 solid solution phases. One of the most important results for the understanding of the doping-properties influence nature was obtained from the silver doped samples. The in-situ analysis was provided up to 600°C with the subsequent cooling. The diffractogram pattern from the Ag-doped sample at the room temperature is presented on the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> a. As can be seen from the Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> the change of Ag occupancies with the temperature correlates with Seebeck coefficient change. Also it was observed that after 300 °C minor amount of Ag appears in the sample, the same time not identified phase (Ag containing phase?) at 5.59° disappear (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>). Change of Ag occupancies with the temperature in samples produced in the different laboratories and using different methods have the same character and the same accordance to the properties change. For the samples doped with Bi no change of doping occupancies was observed, character of the temperature dependence of thermo power for the bismuth doped samples does not differ from the pure Mg 2 Si. 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Silver doped Mg 2 Si TM_CAEN_20120306 1st cycle 2nd cycle 3rd cycle Seebeck Coefficient (V/K) Temperature (K) Figure 3: a -Temperature dependence of silver occupancies on the silicon in Mg2Si doped samples, red curve -heating, blue curve -cooling; btemperature dependence of Seebeck coefficient for Mg2Si samples doped with Ag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Conclusions</head><p>The experiment allowed us to establish a link between the dopants content in the lattice and the thermoelectric properties. Besides this, obtained information about phase compositions and phase compositions changes with the time and temperature was important for the future decision about which of the compositions and dopants are perspective for future investigation and which are not.</p><p>b c a Ag occupancy Temperature, °C</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Typical diffraction pattern recorded from Mg2(SixSn1-x)ySb1-y samples</figDesc><graphic coords="1,164.15,634.70,266.90,142.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
