<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic mercury is a large-scale environmental problem at northern latitudes. In areas dominated by wetlands, organic soils and humic surface waters, high concentrations of the very toxic form of Hg, methyl mercury, is formed. Limited knowledge about the coordination chemistry of Hg 2+ and CH 3 Hg + in natural organic matter (NOM) of soils and streams has hampered mechanistic research about central biochemical processes in soils and surface waters such as methylation of Hg 2+ to CH 3 Hg + , demethylation of CH 3 Hg + and reduction of Hg 2+ to Hg 0 .</p><p>The main aim of this EXAFS study was to determine the coordination chemistry of methyl mercury (CH 3 Hg + ) and the inorganic ion Hg 2+ in soil and stream organic matter. Taking advantage of the high brilliance of Beamline ID26 this could be done at very low concentrations of metal, making EXAFS results as relevant as currently possible for natural situtations in soils and streams. Our hypothesis was that Hg in CH 3 Hg + is two-coordinated with one carbon (the methyl group) and one sulfur atom (RSH, thiols in NOM) and in Hg 2+ with at least one sulfur atom (RSH in NOM). Data on the concentration of RSH in soil and stream organics were obtained from earlier sulphur K-edge XANES determinations on the samples used.</p><p>Methods: EXAFS data at the Hg L III -edge (12 284 eV) were collected for pelleted organic samples in fluorescence mode using Si photodiodes. A Ga filter was used to reduce scattering radiation. No radiation damage was detected, except for a model compound consisting of a carboxyl resin added CH 3 Hg. We performed EXAFS experiments at molar CH 3 Hg / RSH ratios in the range 0.01 -1.62 (corresponding to 100-15000 ppm CH 3 Hg) and at molar Hg / RSH ratios in the range 0.01 -0.85.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Our hypothesis was confirmed. At low CH 3 Hg / RSH ratios, Hg was associated to one C atom (the methyl-group) at an average distance of 2.03 ± 0.02 Å and to one S atom (the RS -group) at an average distance of 2.34 ± 0.03 Å, in the first coordination shell. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 stacked k</ref> 3 data are presented together with fitted spectra (using FEFF-7) and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> corresponding Fourier transforms are shown. Experimental data were satisfactorily fitted by one C and one S atom in the first coordination shell for samples with a CH 3 Hg / RSH ratio of 0.01 -0.30. At higher ratios O and / or N atoms (which are not possible to separate) also were included in the first shell. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> the RSF peak at approximately 1.55 -1.60 Å (not corrected for phaseshift), most obvious in FP sample, represents the Hg-C bond within the methyl mercury molecule, whereas the peak / shoulder at 1.95-2.00 Å represents a Hg -S bond with the thiol group. At calculated CH 3 Hg / RSH ratios above 0.37 in organic soils, 0.32 in gently extracted organics from soil and 0.24 in stream organics, the organic RS -sites were completely saturated by CH 3 Hg + and therefore O and / or N atoms were found in the first coordination shell of Hg at an average distance of 2.09 ± 0.01 Å. This Hg -O/N bond is reflected by a peak around 1.60 Å in samples in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> with CH 3 Hg / RSH ratios of 0.95 and 1.08. Based on the assumption that RSH and RSSH groups take part in the complexation of CH 3 Hg + , whereas RSSR and RSR groups do not, our results suggest that approximately 17 % of total organic S consisted of RSH + RSSH functionalities in the organic soil. Corresponding figures for gently extracted soil organics and stream organics were 14 and 9 %, respectively. Also Hg 2+ was found to be two-coordinated in soil and stream NOM, with at least one S atom at low Hg / RSH ratios (data not shown). Overall the EXAFS experiment was very successful and the unique data generated will lay a basis for further in-depth biogeochemical research about Hg in the environment. Similar studies with other trace metals, using beamline ID 26, will produce results with an unique qualtity at a very low metal concentration as compared with existing EXAFS studies on metal-NOM associations.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. k3-weighted Hg EXAFS data for model compounds, organic soil (OS) and gently extracted organics from soil (PS) and fen peat (FP) att varying CH 3 Hg / RSH ratios.
