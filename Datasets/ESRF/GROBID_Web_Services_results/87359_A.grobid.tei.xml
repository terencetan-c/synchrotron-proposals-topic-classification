<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There were no technical problems with the beamline during the measurements. System 1 of proposal was concerned with the Box C/D snoRNP system from eukaryots, which is responsible for transferring the 2'-O-Methylations on ribosomal RNAs. This protein-RNA complex is composed of four different proteins (Snu13p, Nop1p, Nop56p and Nop58p) and one Box C/D guide snoRNA, which transfers the target specificity. Two chimeric complexes of different composition could be assembled for SAXS measurements. The first one consisted of the eukaryotic components Snu13p, Nop1p and a selected guide snoRNA and the chimeric Nop556 protein, which contains parts of the Nop5 protein, from the well studied archaeal Box C/D snoRNP complex, and the part of the eukaryotic Nop56p protein that interacts with the Nop1p protein.</p><p>The second complex consisted of the eukaryotic Snu13p and the same selected guide snoRNA and the Nop5 and Fibrillarin proteins from the archaeal Box C/D system. For both complexes only the selected guide snoRNA assembled into complexes good enough to perform meaningful SAXS measurements. Addition of targets was not performed because the complexes showed the formation of an non-homogeneous higher oligomeric state upon target RNA addition, on gel filtration during the sample preparation. For both complexes different concentrations (ranging from 0.5 -5.5mg/mL) were measured in batch mode. The obtained Rg values were found to increase with increasing concentration, signifying a concentration dependent change in the oligomeric state of the complexes, even though the best possible complexes were chosen. Despite the good indication on the oligomeric state of the complexes obtained from SAXS data further studies will be required to confirm the final oligomeric of state of this snoRNP.</p><p>System 2 of the proposal was concerned with the the reductase domain of the TomAB non-ribosomal peptide synthase. Reductase domain of the Non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) is a unique domain that catalyzes both product release and reduction as the last step in the biosynthesis of the peptides, using the cofactor NADPH. Unfortunately, the different constructs of reductase domain of the TomAB system severely aggregated at concentrations required for the dilution series in the SAXS measurements and hence were not amenable for further studies. Moreover, the cofactor NADPH was found to be highly unstable in the solution conditions required for SAXS measurements. However, another domain of the TomAB non-ribosomal system involved in catalysis of peptide bond formation (BC), which also purportedly interacts with the reductase domain, was used for the experiments. The constructs of the protein with varying lengths of the N-terminus were probed by SAXS to check for the effect of the N-terminal residues on the folding and conformational properties of the protein. A dilution series was performed on both the constructs: BC and BCdelN. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the logarithmic plot of logIq vs s for BC. The linear behavior in the Guinier region indicates that there are no interparticle effects even at higher concentration of the protein indicating that this protein remains monodisperse and monomeric.</p><p>s(1/nm) s(1/nm) Log(intensity) Log(intensity) 0.72mg/uL Rg 4.95 nm 1.43mg/mL Rg 5.08nm 2.8mg/mL Rg 5.12nm 5.7mg/mL Rg 5.47nm 0.66mg/uL Rg 5.03 nm 1.32mg/mL Rg 5.18nm 2.65mg/mL Rg 5.11nm 5.7mg/mL Rg 5.21nm  Figure 1: Scattering curves for various concentration of BC of TomAB NRPS system. The inlet shows the linear guinier region of the curves alongwith their respective Rg and I(0).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the scattering curve for the truncated BCdelN. In case of BCdelN, different structural models predicted by homology modeling for this protein were scored against the observed SAXS data. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the scattering curve of BCdelN alongwith the predicted curve for one of the models. The observed and back-calculated curves match and so do the R(g)s. This shows that we could discriminate against current available structures that vary in conformational flexibility. We will use the best-fit models for further computational and structural studies. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Dhimole*: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER 2) Prof. Dr. Teresa Carlomagno: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER 3) Simone Hoefler*: Laboratory Leibniz Hannover University BMWZ Schneiderberg 38 DE -30167 HANNOVER Report: Samples from the proposal number MX-1974 were measured on 2 nd and 3rd of December 2017.</figDesc></figure>
