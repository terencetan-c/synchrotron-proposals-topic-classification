<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the structural response associated with photoinduced electron transfer in a Ru-Co photocatalytic model system (see beamtime application for further details about the scientific background).</p><p>During the beamtime, we succesfully measured time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) of the Ru-Co molecule and a series of reference compounds in solution. Additionally, we were able to implement an X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) setup at the beamline, which allowed us to record time-resolved XES data simultaneously with the XDS experiment. The XES setup formed the basis of the permanent XES setup that still exists at the beamline today.</p></div>

Lower panel: The residual from the fit contains features at the low-Q region that cannot be described by the</head><p>The XDS data of the Ru-Co molecule recorded 3 ns after excitation is shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The majority of the signal can be described by solvent heat/density and a solute signal based on DFT calculations of the ground state and excite state structures. With the best fit, however, there is still a small residual that cannot be fitted by these components.</p><p>The solute fit corresponds to a structural change of 0.2 Å, associated with a population of the 2 Ru(III)-4 Co(II) high spin state, as sketched in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. This confirms photo-induced electron transfer from the ruthenium site to the cobalt site, which was the main objective of the beamtime. The current challenge is to describe the solvent-cage interactions in a better way. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, lower panel shows the residual of the fitted data plotted against the solvent-cage scattering based on a molecular dynamics simulation of the solvent response. Such classical descriptions of the solvent response have been proved effective for molecules that have similar dipole moments in the ground state and excited state. In this case, however, the electron transfer changes the electronic environment around the Ru-site and Co-site drastically, and thus a quantum mechanical description of the solute-solvent interaction is required.</p><p>Currently, we are working with collegues from DTU chemistry to simulate the Ru-Co in acetonitrile solutions with a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics hybrid framework. The output from these simulations is expected to describe the solvent-cage effects observed in the data in a way that allows us to optimize the fit even more. Thus, we will not only learn about the solvent interactions of this photocatalytic model system, but we will also be able to furhter refine the structural information about the excited state molecule. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 Illustration of the process observed in the experiment. The ruthenium center is excited with visible light, which induces electron transfer to the cobalt site. The electron transfer results in a population of the intobonding e g orbital, which causes an expansion of the Co-N bond by 0.2 Å.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,151.68,432.56,292.08,195.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
