<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Stabilization of low-density polymorphs by negative pressure The combined SAXS-WAXS experiment allowed us to confirm the stabilization at room temperature of Rocksalt CsCl which was crystallized from the molten CsCl infiltrated within the SBA-15. In the experiment, we also investigated the possibility of stabilizing rocksalt CsBr and CsI within SBA-15 mesopores. The main findings reloated to WAXS and SAXS are reportedd below</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Findings obtained from WAXS:</head><p>These temperature-dependent experiments yielded several unexpected results: 1) CsCl rocksalt was stabilized at room temperature, but two Fm-3m phases were present with significantly different lattice parameter (7.012 Å for smaller crystals (F1) formed within the channels vs the 6.982 Å of the larger crystals stabilized outside the channels (F2)) (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). 2) Small nuclei of the rocksalt CsCl were already present above 320ºC, well below the 469ºC of the bulk transition. Since only a mix of CsCl+SBA-15 was investigated and not a capillary with only CsCl, it is not clear if such early nucleation is due to the presence of SBA-15 or common for CsCl (note that no reports exist on synchrotron XRD experiments on heating CsCl).</p><p>3) The infiltration of CsBr into SBA-1 did not occur (no diminution of the intensity of SAXS peaks observed, in contrast with the case of CsCl and CsBr) but in spite of that we observed the formation of Rocksalt CsBr at high temperature (between 600ºC and 530ºC, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>), not reported so far in heating-cooling experiments, but only in ultrathin epitaxial films 9 or in cluster beams in vacuum. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Here again, the lack of control experiment (heating a capillary with only CsBr) did not allow assessing the role of SBA-15 in the process. 4) The CsI infiltrated in SBA-15 did not crystallize in rocksalt on cooling. However, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>, the lattice parameter of the cubic primitive crystals formed within the pores (P1) is significantly larger than that of the primitive crystals (P2) formed outside the silica channels (aF1=4.698 Å, aF2=4.664 Å), suggesting that the liquid is subjected to tensile strain upon cooling. Besides confirming our previous findings, the aim of this proposal is getting further insights on the stabilization of rocksalt of Cs halides in nanoporous confinement, namely by addressing points 1)-4) discussed above. An additional experiment to complete the WAXS results will take place in June 2023 at the MSPD beamline of ALBA synchrotron</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Findings obtained from SAXS:</head><p>The temperature-dependent SAXS data is being analyzed by fitting experimental data using a home-made minimization procedure involving MINUIT [1] package program in collaboration with Alessandro Longo. Infinitely long cylinders are taken into account in the form factor P(q) and an hexagonal ordering is considered in the structure factor S(q) a Porod contribution has also been considered. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents the fits obtained for the sample before (A) and after (B) the heating experiment. The fits indicate that a fraction of the SBA-15 pores have been filled but that others have remained empty, while the hexagonal ordering is maintained. This confirms the findings obtained by TEM would indicate that the infiltration of molten CsCl does not destroy the ordering of mesopores.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Dr. Nico Dix, Dr. Martí Gich, Mr. Pierrick Merlin Institut de Ciència de Mterials de Barcelona-CSIC,</figDesc></figure>
