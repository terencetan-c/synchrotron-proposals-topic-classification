<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>At ambient pressure ZrTe 3 shows a transition to a charge-density wave (CDW) modulated ground state at T CDW = 63 K. The incommensurate propagation vector q CDW = (0.07,0,0.3333) lies in the a*-c* plane of the reciprocal lattice. Previous resistivity measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have shown that the filamentary superconductivity found at temperatures below T c ≈ 4 K is quickly suppressed by applying hydrostatic pressure. At the same time the CDW transition temperature rises to 100 K around 2 GPa and then decreases again before the CDW signature is lost around 5 GPa. We have measured the CDW related incommensurate superstructure reflections by single crystal diffraction at high pressure and low temperatures.</p><p>Single crystals of this two-dimensional material form platelets of several mm lateral size and up to 200 µm thickness. Small discs of 50 -150 µm diameter were cut using laser-cutting and captured by scotch tape, which also served to further cleave the samples down to thicknesses of ~30 µm. These platelets were loaded into a diamond anvil cell with 600 µm cutlet size and 300 µm diameter holes in a stainless steel gasket. The pressure medium was He and the hydrostatic pressure was measured by fluorescence of a ruby chip.</p><p>The cell was mounted in a He flow cryostat with an attached gas membrane for pressurizing the sample in situ. Precise control of the temperature and pressure in the range of 15 K &lt; T &lt; 300 K and 0.2 GPa &lt; P &lt; 6 GPa was employed. Diffraction data were acquired using the MAR 3450 image plate detector in the forward scattering direction with the focused x-ray beam of 2x2 µm 2 , which served to choose a spot of good crystallinity in the single crystal samples. The c* axis is naturally aligned to being close to parallel to the incoming beam, while the a* axis was chosen close to perpendicular to the φ rotation axis. In this way the a*b* plane is readily spanned on the detector in oscillations of φ, while different c* components are accessible within the opening of the cell of ±20°. The data were indexed and reconstructed high symmetry planes were extracted using the CrysAlis software.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the reconstructed a*-c* diffraction plane of ZrTe 3 at pressures of 0.2 GPa, 2 GPa and 5 GPa. The pictures have been taken with varying degree of over-exposing thus the different gray-scale contrast. In all cases the superstructure spots are clearly visible near (4 0 -1) in the center of each picture. The component q b of the CDW modulation remains zero, while the components q a and q c change with pressure, thus changing the angle of the CDW modulation within the reciprocal lattice. The lattice itself shows a slight, anisotropic compression with pressure, but no change of the monoclinic angle is observed. The data shown here were taken at T = 40 K &lt; T CDW for each case. Increasing the temperature toward T CDW reproduces the phase boundary reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and shows no change of the CDW modulation, which remains incommensurate at all temperatures. Also above P = 5 GPa, the CDW is lost as reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>From the data shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the components q a and q c of the CDW modulation can be extracted. q c = 0.3333 at ambient pressure corresponds to a tripling of the basic unit cell in the modulated ground state. The extracted components are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Upon slight increase of the pressure P , the component q c is quickly diminished. In an intermediate pressure range around 0.5 GPa, it is compatible with a value of q c 0.25, i.e. a quadrupling of the unit cell along c. At higher pressures this component, like q a , becomes incommensurate.</p><p>0.11 0.10 0.09 0.08 0.07 0.06 q a (r.l.u) 5 4 3 2 1 0 pressure (GPa) q a 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 q c (r.l.u) 5 4 3 2 1 0 pressure (GPa) 0.33333 0.25 q c</p><p>Figure 2: Pressure dependence of the components q a and q c of the CDW modulation vector as extracted from images as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The components are shown in untis relative to the respective basic crystal lattice at each pressure.</p><p>This results shows that the CDW modulation and thus the Fermi surface nesting condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> changes with pressure. Upon slight compression of the lattice up to 0.6 GPa the locking of the component q c to 1 / 3 is released. At the same time, the component q a is enlarged, thus corresponding to a larger opening of the Fermi surface. Effectively this change of components corresponds to a rotation of the CDW wave vector. This low pressure region is where resisitvity measurements have found a suppression of superconductivity and an increase of the CDW transition temperature. At pressures above 1 GPa, where the CDW transition is stable and then decreases until it is lost at 5 GPa, the diffraction data show a gentle continuation of the rotation of q CDW in reciprocal space. The loss of CDW at 5 GPa is found in our data, too, but it is not related to any special re-configuration of the CDW modulation and thus the Fermi surface nesting. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Reconstructed a*-c* planes of diffraction from ZrTe3 at T =40 K and pressures P of (a) 0.2 GPa, (b) 2 GPa and (c) 5 GPa.
