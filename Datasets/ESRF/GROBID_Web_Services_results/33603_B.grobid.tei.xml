<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Six samples have been chosen for current studies, four orthogallates LaGaO 3 , CeGaO 3 , PrGaO 3 and NdGaO 3 , whose perovskite lattice deformation increases smoothly with increase of periodic number of rare-earth element and two solid solutions La 0.50 Pr 0.50 GaO 3 and La 0.63 Nd 0.37 GaO 3 with magnitude of perovskite lattice deformation close to one in cerium gallate. All samples except cerium gallate were grown either by Czhohralski or floating zone technique, while CeGaO 3 was synthesized by solid state reaction method with subsequent arc melting. in argon. Crystal structure of chosen materials is well defined in a broad temperature range and their structural studies were already reported in the literature. More than 140 diffraction patterns have been collected for six samples at plenty of pressures during experiment. The data evaluation has been performed using the Rietveld method and full profile decomposition technique (Le-Bail) implemented into GSAS and FullProf program packages, while single profile decomposition was carried out using WinCSD software.</p><p>We have started experiment with lanthanum gallate. Among all rare-earth gallates this material possesses smallest perovskite cell distortion and its thermal and pressure behaviour of crystal structure were studied quite extensively. Thus it is well known from the literature that LaGaO 3 undergoes orthorhombic-to-rhombohedral phase transformation which can be either temperature (ca. 420 K) or pressure driven. In our experiment the first diffraction pattern has been collected already at 3.5 GPa and splitting of characteristic Bragg reflections reveals the LaAlO 3 type of structure at this pressure unambiguously. Similar behaviour occurs for other rare-earth gallates, where phase transformations have been observed, i.e. CeGaO 3 at 10(1) GPa, PrGaO 3 at 24(1) GPa, NdGaO 3 at 38(1) GPa, La 0.50 Pr 0.50 GaO 3 at 10.1(2) GPa and La 0.63 Nd 0.37 GaO 3 at 12.3(6) GPa.</p><p>Lattice parameters contract almost linear with temperature, obtained compressibilities</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P L L ∂ ∂ = β</formula><p>for a-and c-directions of rhombohedral lattice (β a and β c ) are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.
