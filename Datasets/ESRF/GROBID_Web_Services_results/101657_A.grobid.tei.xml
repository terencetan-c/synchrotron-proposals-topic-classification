<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the proposal is to collect diffraction patterns from single Loxosceles silk ribbons with a width of 6-8 microns and a thickness of about 50 nm in order to determine its hierarchical structural organization. Scanning SAXS/WAXS experiments were performed in transmission geometry at the nanofocus branch of the ID13 beamline using a 70 nm (hxv) beam of about 2x10 11 ph/s @ 13.0 keV.</p><p>Selected samples provided by the co-proposer Prof. H. Schniepp and his group are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>. For the most challenging sample of single ribbons on a Si3N4 substrate, promising areas with "flat" ribbons (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) documented at Schniepp' s lab, could be readily localized on-line using the ID13 beamline microscope. Scattering patterns were recorded with -typically-10-20 ms exposure to limit radiation damage. All samples shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref> were probed for a detector-to-sample distance covering the WAXS-range. Single, flat ribbons were also probed at a larger detector distance, optimized for SAXS.</p><p>A short summary of the experiments performed is provided below. A detailed analysis of the recorded patterns is in progress.</p><p>(1) Raw bundle of Loxosceles silk collected from a web.</p><p>The aim was obtaining a well-defined pattern for comparison with the patterns from single ribbons. WAXS patterns with fiber texture but with significant azimuthal spread were recorded at several positions of a raw bundle of ribbons from a web (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.).</p><p>(2) Single ribbon extruded from Loxosceles spiders by forced silking, wound around metal O-ring.</p><p>The aim was obtaining highly oriented SAXS/WAXS patterns by averaging multiple patterns from a single ribbon. Scanning SAXS/WAXS was performed with lateral resolution down to 50 nm normal to the ribbon's axis and down to 500 nm along the ribbons axis to limit radiation damage propagation. The ribbon could be imaged at the scanned areas by density projections based on the strongest equatorial peaks or SAXS. Preliminary analysis of a single scanned area scanned revealed the strongest (020)/(210) equatorial peaks of the poly(Lalanine) structure with a narrow angular spread.</p><p>(3) Single extruded ribbons deposited on Si3N4 substrates of 1-micron thickness.</p><p>The aim was exploring in particular the hierarchical organization at the ribbons interface. Multiple ribbons were scanned with the same lateral resolution as for (2), revealing SAXS&amp; WAXS density projections.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 a) Raw Loxosceles web silk stretched on Si3N4 membrane. b) Loxosceles ribbon obtained forced silking of spider, wound several times around metal O-ring. c) Area of Si3N4 membrane with deposited Loxosceles ribbons.
