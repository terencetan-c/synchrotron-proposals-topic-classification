<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to help in our interpretation of the highly complex behaviour of the RIXS data which we have obtained concerning mixed valent Ce compounds, we performed some preliminary high resolution 2p3d RIXS experiments on La and Nd compounds at the L 2,3 edges. Both types of compounds led to interesting results, but here we concentrate on those for La which are of greater relevance to the studies on Ce. Though the latter are the subject of on-going calculations, it has become clear that a proper understanding of the interactions between 4f and 5d states, where the latter are hybridized with 3d or 4d transition metals or plike states, calls for comparable work on the neighbouring elements. A good illustration of the usefulness of such studies is provided by comparing the data we have obtained for the CeF 3 and LaF 3 ionic compounds.</p><p>Our earlier experiments on CeF 3 (see ESRF Highlights 97/98, and Gallet et al 1999) revealed the presence of two low intensity peaks in the Raman regime attributed to quadrupole excitations. The two peaks separated by approximately 3 eV are interpreted as arising from excitations to parallel and antiparallel alignments of the two 4f electrons in the presence of the final-state 3d hole, i.e., 4f 1 5d 0 →2p 5 4f 2 5d 0 →3d 9 4f 2 5d 0 (see <ref type="bibr">Bartolomé et al 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">and Gallet et al 1999)</ref>.</p><p>It is striking to note that such a two-peak structure is also observed in the La L 3 RIXS (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Here the ground state is 4f 0 5d 0 so the interpretation is not the same as that given for the structure in Ce. Instead the two-peak structure must be the result of the alignment of a 4f electron whose spin is parallel or anti-parallel to that of the 3d core-hole. It therefore necessarily involves the high probability of a spin flip in the overall excitation-decay process. This in turn means that the spin is not a good quantum number as a consequence of spin-orbit interaction. An atomic multiplet calculation is underway to understand the exact origin of this unexpected structure We also performed RIXS measurements at the La L 2 -edge in LaF 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). A quadrupole transition is clearly observed. From XAS experiments it was previously concluded that quadrupole transitions were not observable at the rare earth L 2 -edges (see <ref type="bibr">van Veenendaal et al 1997)</ref>. We also measured similar structure in a La intermetallic (not shown).</p><p>Note that we have been able to improve the total resolving power to ~ 5000 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) which is close to the limit which can be obtained with a two crystal monochromator. We believe that under the present operating conditions our x-ray spectrometer, despite its very compact transportable size, introduces a broadening of ~0.2 eV.</p></div>
