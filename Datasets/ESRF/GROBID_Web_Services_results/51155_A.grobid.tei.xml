<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the high-performance and low-cost (Mn,Fe) 2 (P,Si) magnetocaloric compounds the ferromagnetic phase transition is accompanied by a large latent heat. The transition temperature can be conveniently tuned around room temperature by changing the chemical composition (Mn/Fe and P/Si ratios). As a result, this system is a promising candidate for magnetic cooling and power conversion applications. Recent first principle electronicstructure calculations indicate that at the first-order phase transition a strong electronic reconstruction takes place where in the paramagnetic state the Fe atoms lose their moment, while the Mn moments are conserved [1] .</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to experimentally test these predictions and probe the evolution of the magnetic moments in an element specific manner across the ferromagnetic phase transition, i.e., both in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states. The X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) experiments were performed at the ID08 beamline. The measurements were taken by tuning the energy at both the Mn and Fe L 2,3 edges (2p →3d transition). The X-ray absorption spectra were recorded using the Total-Electron Yield (TEY) mode, and normalized to the intensity of incident beam. The sample temperature was regulated in the temperature range from 230 to 330 K.</p><p>The X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra correspond to the sum of positive (µ + ) and negative (µ -) absorption signals, while the XMCD spectrum is calculated from the difference between µ + and µ -. Three polycrystalline materials MnFe 0.95 P 0.582 B 0.078 Si 0.34 , Mn 1.25 Fe 0.7 P 0.52 Si 0.48 and Mn 1.25 Fe 0.7 P 0.5 B 0.01 Si 0.49 were measured.

The incident X-ray beam and magnetic field are parallel to each other and oriented perpendicular to the sample surface. In order to assure the cleanliness of sample surface and remove surface oxidation, the pellets were scrapped in situ with a diamond file in the preparation chamber before the measurements. The extraction of the Fe and Mn moment from the experimental XMCD data has been performed using the sum rules and multiplet calculations.</p><p>As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, from XAS, it is found that no significant valence change and generally speaking no spectral shape modification is observed at the FOMT. From XMCD, the magnetic field and temperature dependences of the magnetic moments were obtained for the Fe and Mn moments for two Fe/Mn ratios. It is observed that the manganese exhibits a much lower magnetization on the 3f site than on the 3g. In contrast to theoretical predictions, it is observed that neither the Mn nor the Fe moments are fully quenched in the paramagnetic state (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). These results suggest that the magnitude of the reduction of the Fe 3f moments at T C is overestimated by ab-initio calculations. On one hand, part of this discrepancy might arise from the measurements that are done in the vicinity of the FOMT. The reduction in moment might be gradual due to the developing short-range order above the transition. On the theoretical side, the change in the balance between bond formation and magnetism for Fe and its neighbouring atoms might be overestimated. The paper on this work has been submitted.
