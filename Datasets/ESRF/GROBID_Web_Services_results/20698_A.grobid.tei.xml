<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reports accompanying requests for additional beam time</head><p>An experimental report on previous measurements -if necessary, a preliminary report -must be attached to all subsequent requests for beam time. The Peer Review Panel reserves the right to refuse to examine new proposals from groups who have not reported on the use of beam time allocated previously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructions for preparing your Report</head><p>• fill in a separate form for each project or series of measurements.</p><p>• include the reference number of the proposal to which the report refers.</p><p>• make sure that the text, tables and figures fit into the space available.</p><p>• if your work is published or is in press, you may prefer to paste in the abstract, and add full reference details • bear in mind that the report will be reduced to 71% of its original size. A type-face such as "Times", 14 points, with a 1.5 line spacing between lines for the text, produces a report which can be read easily.</p></div>

We have also demonstrated the role of the surface in inducing a preferred orientation of the polymer chains on crystallisation. The detailed kinetics can be followed in real-time using a compact high vacuum chamber for insitu studies.</p><p>Buried polymer interfaces are crucial for structural integrity of multilayers, for adhesion and for semiconducting polymer devices. In this experiment, we aimed to understand the kinetics of crystallisation at a buried polymer-polymer interface. Does the kinetics of crystallisation at such an interface proceed at a rate similar to that of the free surface or at a rate typical of the bulk polymer?</p><p>In order to investigate the upper interface of a buried polymer layer, we needed a suitable polymer complement having a lower electron density than PET. Polystyrene (PS) was selected for this giving the required refraction effects (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, the difference in the critical angle for PET and PS is of the order of 0.02° and hence considerable care was required to penetrate the PS while limiting the penetration in the PET film. PS also remains amorphous but the glass transition temperature is about 100°C close to the crystallisation temperature of PET.</p><p>The diffracted intensity was scanned with the Q vector parallel to the surface during in-situ anneals at temperatures of 90°C, 95°C, 100°C and 115°C. At 90°C, no crystallisation was observed, in contrast with a free PET surface where we observe crystallisation after about 60 minutes. For 95°C we observe peaks corresponding to crystalline PET after 90 minutes (fig. <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>). For longer annealing times, the crystalline peaks disappear. At 100°C, we do not observe crystalline PET peaks at all (fig. <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>). The disappearance of the crystalline peaks is caused by interdiffusion at the interface, as confirmed by reflectivity. The rate crystallisation at 90°C and 95°C is consistent with the crystallisation rate in bulk PET.</p><p>The results are currently being analysed for a publication. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 0 5000 10000 15000 3 hrs 4½ hrs 5½ hrs 90 min 40 min 25 min 8 min as spun Intensity (arbitrary units) Q(Å -1 ) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 4 hr 90 min 60 min 35 min 20 min 7 min as spun Intensity (arbitrary units) Q(Å -1 ) Fig. 2 Diffraction scans during in-situ annealing of a PET/PS bilayer at (a) 95°C, (b) 100°C (a) (b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): M Durell*, and J E Macdonald* Department of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University P Jukes*, A Higgins* and R A L Jones Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield Report:</figDesc></figure>
