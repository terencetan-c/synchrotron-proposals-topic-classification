<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of this experiment was to explore the capabilities of this beam line regarding the study of phonon dispersion curves and its advantages and disadvantages with respect to inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The scientific case we have chosen is the problem of the measurement of phase excitations in incommensurate quasi-one dimensional compounds, as it has recently been measured in the compound K0,3M003 by inelastic cold neutron scattering techniques. As it can be seen in the figure of the proposal, the phase excitations are characterised by a very steep dispersion around the superlattice peaks, as the phase mode velocity is proportional to the Fermi velocity. Due to the poorer q-resolution of the neutron experiments this task is a real tour de force for neutrons. We have used the Si(9 9 9) reflection of the monochromator which corresponds to an incident energy of 17 794 eV. The sample was mounted in a closed-cycle He refrigerator with a very limited angular range of the sample rotation (maximum 200). The scattering plane was the horizontal one, where the best energy resolution is achieved, and the maximum scattering angle was 14Â°. The sample was a ribbon 1.9*3 mmz in surface and 120~m in thickness (the best compromise between absorption and diffracted intensity at this wavelength). The sample was mounted with the (2x, m, -x) plane parallel to the scattering plane. As a result of these severe constraints we only have access to one Bragg reflection 01=(0 2 0) and, below the phase transition temperature &lt;Tc=l 83 K), to one superlattice reflection Q2=( 1; 1.264, -0.5), with a measured intensities ratio I(Q1)/I(Q2)=l .5.100. There is in addition a third peak centred at zero energy transfer which is attributed to diffuse scattering from the sample.</p><p>The resolution profile was measured on the diffuse scattering and the line shape is found to be a distorted lorentzian, with a fwhm= 2.4 meV. The quality of the data and the low counting time needed to obtain reasonably good spectra shows that the capabilities of this instrument, working at the Si(9 9 9) reflection, can be compared with those of standard thermal neutrons three axis spectrometers. In figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>-</head><figDesc>We first measured the low energy transverse acoustic phonon dispersion curve along the (2~, O, -~) direction, as it is shown in figure1. In these constant-Q scans we see the progressive development of 2 peaks, that corresponds to phonon creation and phonon annihilation, whose energy increases as we go away from the Bragg peak position (O 2 O).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>we have plotted the phonon dispersion curve and compared with similar data obtained with neutrons.Encouraged by these results we set up to measure the soft mode above T c along the (1, 1+~, -0.5) direction. No trace of any extra intensityc , and no trace of phase and amplitude modes appeared in our scans. This result must be taken with care, as the experimental constraints prevented us of searching the soft mode at optimum Q-positions. From our experience in neutron scattering studies on similar problems we expect variations of the phonon intensities of more than an the largest. Another important issue is the difficulty to deal with the lorentzian tails of the instrumental resolution that makes the diffuse scattering increase the effective background in the low energy part of the spectra. Finally the pure inelastic background is low (10 counts/60s) but not as low as in neutron scattering measurements (1 -2 counts/60 s).</figDesc></figure>
