<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we have investigated the structure of ice VII under high pressure and high temperature in the domain 0-25 GPa and 600-1000 K, i.e. close to the melting line. The measurements were motivated by recently published computer simulations by Takii et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and Aragones &amp; Vega <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> which claim that ice VII transforms into a plastic phase at high temperature, before melting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In this phase, the H 2 O molecules can more or less freely rotate around the oxygen, i.e. this is a dynamical transition to a "rotorphase", as found in other molecular solids at low pressure such as NH 3 and CH 4 . The timescale of rotations is typically in the ps range. Although x-ray diffraction pattern of such a phase can hardly be distinguished from "ordinary" ice VII due to the low scattering power of hydrogen, the simulations predict a measurable volume change between normal and plastic ice VII. The existence of a plastic phase would resolve the long-standing problem of the melting line of ice VII at high P/T. Some previous experiments obtained by visual observation in a diamond anvil cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> reported a melting line at considerably higher temperatures than expected from the extrapolation of the low P/T melting line and the possible existence of a "new ice phase" between the melting line and ordinary ice VII. Although these data are very controversial, they provide in fact considerable support to the computer simulations.</p><p>In our measurements HS-3939 we have carried out x-ray diffraction using externally heated DACs which is the only method which gives structural data under well defined and homogeneous temperatures. Our measurements can be regarded as a full success, despite the technical difficulties related to the extremely high chemical reactivity of the sample under such extreme conditions (to give an example, at ~1000 K, the ruby or SrB 4 O 7 :Sm 2+ pressure markers are dissolved within a few seconds as soon as ice VII melts, usually followed by a failure of the anvils). In total 4 DACs were preloaded in our laboratory with high purity water and various pressure markers. All cells were loaded with SrB 4 O 7 :Sm 2+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and a two of them had additionally a small piece of gold for which the equation of state is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. Temperatures were measuremed with a K-type thermocouple glued to the diamond anvil. External heating was achieved using our own setup reaching a maximum temperature of 950 K. At the highest temperatures the DACs were flooded with Ar to avoid excessive corrosion. XRD pattern from H 2 O and Au were collected using a monochromatic x-ray beam (0.414 Å) focussed to 20 x 20 µm 2 and a 2D image plate (MAR345). The DAC opening allows for collecting diffraction lines up to 2θ=35°, i.e. d&gt;0.7 Å. Althought the patterns of ice were strongly textured, the data quality was sufficient to derive lattice parameters with the required precision. Two of the loadings failed during isobaric heating (at ~ 700 K) prior to reaching the interesting P/T domain. Neverthless these runs helped to find out an experimental protocol (gasket material and dimensions, P-T path) which was succesful in the two other loadings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained</head><p>From the data we obtained on the two successful loadings we confirm that the melting line has a kink at ~750 K / 16 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We have measured the equation of state on an isotherm at 850 K and find a small but detectable difference of ~0.5% in the molar volumes in the plastic area compared to the P/T domain of "ordinary" ice VII, i.e. the extrapolation of the low temperature melting line. Such a volume jump is agreement with the prediction of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In a second loading we have attempted to reach 1000 K but unfortunately were able to collect only a few pressure points before the anvils broke.</p><p>The current dataset gives hence strong evidence of a plastic phase in ice VII, but the amount of data is too limited to draw a detailed phase diagramm, i.e. we are limited to 3 points at the melting line, 1 full isochore, and a maximum temperature 950 K. Additional beamtime to reach higher temperatures would be highly desirably.  : Phase diagram of H 2 O according to computer simulations of Refs. [1,2].

Note the apparent kink in the melting line and the possible existence of a plastic phase below of it which would reconcile all set of measurements.</p><p>diffraction pattern of ice VII obtained in 3939 in the "plastic" phase.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Phase diagram of H computer simulations of Refs.
