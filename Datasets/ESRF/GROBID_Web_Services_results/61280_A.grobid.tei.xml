<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The production of ammonia from inert dinitrogen is an essential process for all life forms. However, the detailed mechanism of how the triple bond of dinitrogen is activated by iron surfaces in the Haber-Bosch process has remained elusive and many open questions remain regarding the nature of formed surface nitrides, the oxidation state of the active iron and the role of promoters. XRS measurements allowed to obtain N K-O K-and Fe L-edges which provide information about both the surface and bulk composition of the catalyst studied and how this evolves at different stages of the catalyst lifetime.</p><p>During experiment CH4941 at beamline ID20, we obtained X-ray Raman data on series of ammonia synthesis and decomposition catalyst samples synthesized in the group of Prof. Malte Behrens at the University of Duisburg-Essen. The series of samples included calcined, reduced and spent catalyst after ammonia decomposition and after ammonia synthesis. The catalyst was present either in its pure form or was additionally impregnated with KNO 3 in the spinel state.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows Fe L-edge data of the calicned catalyst in its pure form (cal) and impregnated with potassium (cal_KNO 3 ). The spectra look similar and show no measurable influence of KNO 3 impregantion. Fe L-edges of both calcined samples are consistent with iron at Fe(III) oxidation state. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the Fe L-edges of the catalyst at different stages of the reaction: calcined catalyst (cal), reduced catalyst in its pure form (red) and impregnated with potassium (red_KNO 3 ), spent catalyst after NH 3 synthesis in its pure form (sy) and impregnated with potassium (sy_KNO 3 ) and spent catalyst after NH 3 decomposition (de). One can see that unfortunately during transfer of the samples to the sample chamber two of the studied samples: red and sy_KNO 3 partially oxidized to a form similar to the calcined samples. For the red and sy_KNO 3 samples one can see that the average oxidation state of Fe is much lower, with α-Fe being major component of the sample. In spent catalyst after NH 3 decomposition one can see that Fe is present in oxidized form.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> oxygen K-edges of catalyst at different stages of reaction are presented. Spectrum of calcined sample shows a lot of similarity to the spectra of FeO and Fe 2 O 3 suggesting that these two forms are major components of this sample. O K-edge spectra of the spent catalysts have similar shape to the spectrum of calcined sample, which may be another indication that samples oxidized during transfer or measurement. The different O K-edge spectral shapes of the reduced catalyst strongly suggest that FeO and Fe 2 O 3 are no longer major forms of oxygen in these samples. The O K-edges of the reduced catalysts are consistent with binding of oxygen to magnesium probably either as MgO or as Mg (1-x) Fe x O.</p><p>Nitrogen K-edge spectra were hard to measure due to low intensity of incident beam in this energy region and because of low content of nitrogen in the measured samples. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> the spectra of spent catalyst after NH 3 decomposition and a selected iron nitride reference (Fe x N, x=2-4) (which was determined by Moessbauer spectroscopy to be mixture of Fe 3 N and Fe 4 N) are presented. The presence of N K-edge in spent catalyst is consistent with bulk nitridation in the catalyst during ammonia decomposition.</p><p>The presented data are, of our knowledge, the first XRS spectra collected for a real catalyst and they pave a way towards further in-situ studies of low-energy edges in ammonia synthesis and decomposition catalyst. Future studies will focus on optimizing the sample environment for controlled in situ studies.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Dr. Serena DeBeer* -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion Prof.Dr. Robert Schloegl -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion, Fritz-Haber-Institut Dr. Aleksandra Wandzilak* -Max-Planck-Institut für Chemische Energiekonversion Dr. Christoph Sahle -ESRF</figDesc></figure>
