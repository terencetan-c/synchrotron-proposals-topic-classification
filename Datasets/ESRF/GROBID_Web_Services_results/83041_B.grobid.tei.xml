<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The charge-density-wave (CDW) phenomenon was studied in the model high-Tc superconductor HgBa2CuO4+ (Hg1201) via resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the L3-edge of copper. A crucial question regarding the nature of the CDW phenomenon in the hole-doped cuprates is whether the observed short-range order is static or associated with dynamic spectral features. We measured a single crystal of Hg1201 with Tc = 69K (hole concentration p = 0.083) and constructed energy-momentum RIXS intensity maps, with focus on the CDW momentum transfer, qCDW.</p><p>The spectrometer was set to its highest back-scattering angle (2θ = 149.5°). Different values of the inplane momentum transfer q along the Cu-O bond diretion (H in reciprocal lattice units) were accessed by rotating the sample about an axis perpendicular to the scattering plane. At each rotation angle θ, we measured the spectrum for several minutes, with the beamline and spectrometer conditions optimized for an energy resolution of about 50 meV. Prior to the acquisition of a Hg1201 spectrum, we obtained a spectrum on a thin layer of silver paint (located next to the sample) in order to pinpoint the zero-energy-loss pixel locationon the CCD camera detector.  This increase can be attributed to the CDW order phenomenon, as its momentum position corresponds to qCDW observed via resonant X-ray diffraction (RXD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Although the magnetic excitations (paramagnons) are clearly visible in the spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, no softening is observed at qCDW. Surprisingly, the spectra collected at 250 K, well above the TCDW = 200K <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, show an increase of the quasi-elastic peak intensity around qCDW.</p><p>Motivated by this interesting observation, we have performed detailed data analysis. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the RIXS intensity integrated over specific ranges of the energy transfer. The intensity integrated over the entire energy-loss range (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), which combines the quasi-elastic andinelastic signal, shows a clear peak at 70 K aroud qCDW = 0.28, and no CDW peak at 250 K. This is consistent with our prior RXD result; the analysis mimics the energy-integrated RXD experiment and yields consistent results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> shows the intensity only of the quasi-elastic region. An intense, well-defined peak at qCDW is observed at 70 K. However, a pronounced peak is still observed at 250 K, well above TCDW =200 K. The width of the peak does not became substantialy broader above TCDW, and hence the correlation length does not significantly change across TCDW. The intensity increase thus suggests that the CDW fluctuations are increasingly stabilized and static below TCDW. Furthermore, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref> demonstrates that the intensity integrated over the inelastic part of the spectra, including the magnetic excitations, exhibits a maximum around qCDW at 70 K. The absence of this peak above TCDW suggests that the magnetic excitations may be impacted by the static CDW order at low temperatures. In summary, we performed an initial RIXS measurement of underdoped Hg1201 and observed a pronounced CDW peak in the quasi-elastic signal not only around Tc, but also above TCDW, the characteristc CDW "onset" temperature as determined from prior RXD measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Although no clear evidence of a softening of magnetic excitations was observed, intensity integration that includes the scattering from the paramagnons was found to be clearly enhanced at qCDW in the low-temperature spectra. We anticipate that this line of research, involving a model cuprate compound, will have considerable impact on the field. In order to arrive at a benchmark dataset that will enable improved theoretical modeling of the CDW order and its connection to the pseudogap state and superconductivity, further study (a more detailed temperature dependence as the doping dependence) is required.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1Energy-momentum intensity map of Hg1201.
