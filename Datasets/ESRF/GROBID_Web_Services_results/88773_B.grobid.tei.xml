<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Four grids were mounted and screened, and we collected on the best one. It was not as goodlooking as the grid used for collection during the first session : there were fewer particles in each image. The reproducibility of grid preparation is still a bottleneck in our EM pipeline, as we don't have easy access to a screening microscope where we could unmount the grids and save them for later data collection on the ESRF Krios. One microscope like this will be installed on campus, and the closest one under operation is in Milano. For future data collection, we'll try to come with pre-screened grids to gain collection time! We used 9 second exposures and 45 frames, for a total dose of about dose of ~50e-/Å 2 . 3 images per hole were taken, enabling a data collection of more than 3000 images during the 9 shifts. The defocus ranged from -0.8 to -2.5 um. The microscope operation was very smooth.</p><p>We collected 3084 image stacks of good quality. A dataset of good quality (3.4-3.8 Å range at the moment of writing this report) can be extracted from these images, and features two conformations of the 5-HT3 receptor. The two conformations can be separated in silico using focused classifications and tigh masks. We have not yet published the structures derived from this dataset, which provide insight on the pre-active versus active equilibrium at a better resolution than previously (&gt;4 Å). Actually we are still treating the data, which will be an important part of a publication in preparation.</p><p>The data collected during the first microscope time (Nov 2017) has been included in a landmark publication for our team, and if I'm not wrong one of the first publications using data collected on CM01. </p></div>
