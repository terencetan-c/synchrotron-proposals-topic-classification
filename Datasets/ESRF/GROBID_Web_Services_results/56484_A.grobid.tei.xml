<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments, conducted at ID02 in March 13-15 of 2015, were aimed at gaining an improved understanding of interactions between colloidal particles bearing grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) using USAXS measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>In the present experiments, while the aim was on salt effects on interactions, it was also necessary to characterize the in-house-synthesized dispersions regarding size and size distribution. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the scattering is shown from dilute samples of three batches of pHFBMA particles, all with grafted PEG480 but produced with varying ratio between PEG macromonomer and fluorinated monomer. This ratio needs to be optimized so as to yield a low polydispersity without sacrificing the stability against salt addition. The analysis of the experiments shows that the size dsitribution exhibits a slight bimodality in general. It also shows that the lower the ratio is, the smaller the degree of size bimodality. As will be seen later (cf. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) the LP5 batch in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> exhibits also an extreme stability against the saltingout carbonate anion.</p><p>Turning to the effect of salt, which, in the case of sodium carbonate, worsens the solvent conditions for the PEG graft, this was investigated at constant particle concentration. As can be seen in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, adding sufficient amount of Na 2 CO 3 to the system results in attractions between particles. When the surface-graft consists of PEG2000 these attractions set in when the carbonate concentration exceeds 0.5 M. However, when the graft is shorter as for the particles in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> with PEG480, not even 1 M Na 2 CO 3 is enough to bring about any signs of attractions.</p><p>Particles were also transferred into ethanol in order to correlate the stability of the dispersions with the behavior of bulk PEG solutions. Ethanolic PEG solutions exhibit crystallization at temperatures below 35C. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, on transferring PEG-grafted particles into ethanol, fractal aggregates result indicative of non-equilibrium aggregation due to strong attractions among particles. This behavior can be contrasted with the salting-out of aqueous dispersions, for which attractions gradually strengthen as salt is added. Raising the temperature above 35C did not redisperse the particles in ethanol as anticipated based on the behavior of bulk PEG polymer solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>The fluorinated particles used in this study are nearly refractive index matched to the solvent (both for aqueous and ethanolic dispersions), which means that the der Waals interactions between particle cores are weak. Thus, the attractions observed in the scattering here must derive from polymer-solvent-polymer interactions.</p><p>Publication: Several results of the SAXS and USAXS measurements have now been published as part of an article, J. Ulama, M. Z. Oskolkova, and J. Bergenholtz, "Polymergraft-mediated interactions between colloidal spheres", Langmuir 32, 2882-2890 (2016).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Scattering intensity as a function of q for a constant particle concentration but with varying concentration of sodium carbonate, as labeled. The particles carry a PEG graft of 2000 g/mol molecular weight. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Scattering intensity as a function of q for a constant particle concentration but with varying concentration of sodium carbonate, as labeled. The particles carry a PEG graft of 480 g/mol molecular weight.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>: Scattering intensity from aqueous and ethanolic dispersions of the same pHFBMA-PEG particles. The agreement at high q point to particles maintaining their integrity on transfer into ethanol but the low-q scattering indicates that fractal aggregates form.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Form factors recorded at 10 and 20 m detector distances of three synthesized batches of pHFBMA-PEG particles as a function of the molar ratio between PEG macromonomer and HFBMA monomer.
