<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this project, fully glassy rods of composition Pd42.5Ni27.5Cu30P20 (at.%), 3 mm in diameter and 30 mm long, were prepared. Samples with height:diameter ratio of 2:1 were cut from the cast rods. Uniaxial compression tests were conducted at elevated temperature under flowing argon and constant-displacement-rate up to different inelastic strains (2%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 50%) and applying different strain rates (10 -4 , 10 -3 s -1 ). Full elasticity tensor was determined by RUS to ensure they were anisotropic. The aim of the proposal was to check the structural anisotropy expected in these samples.</p><p>The experiments were performed as scheduled and the whole set of prepared samples was measured. The pair distribution functions of the samples was calculated at different sectors of the images obtained form the 2D detectors in order to determine the structural anisotropy characterizing the position of the different atomic shells in the amorphous structure.</p><p>The determination of the change of the parameters determining the amorphous structure was not found to follow any consistent trend in the samples. This was attributed to the impossibility of reaching the desired precision as the estimation of the errors due to the small tilt of the experimental set-up were of the same order as the tiny structural anisotropic changes in the samples. The work is still in progress with the analysis of a complementary data from an experiment realized in ALBA synchortron on the same samples.</p></div>			</div>
