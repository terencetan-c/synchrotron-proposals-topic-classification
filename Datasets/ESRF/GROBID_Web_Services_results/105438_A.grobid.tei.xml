<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of our work at ID06 was to conduct a high-pressure multi-anvil experiment using a natural fertile mantle starting material (KLB-1) to recreate the pressure-temperature conditions of the mantle and transition zone at sub-solidus conditions (16-21 GPa and 1300-1600ËšC) while making simultaneous X-ray diffraction and density measurements to determine the phases present, their densities, and constrain the P-T conditions of phase transitions.</p><p>During 18 shifts of beamtime and with the excellent support of the ESRF team at ID06 (Wilson Crichton and Anja Rosenthal), four high-pressure multi-anvil experiments using natural and synthetic starting materials were successfully conducted. Each experiment was pressurized, run at temperature for about six hours, and depressurized over a span of approximately 30 hours. Experiments were monitored during the run-time to observe phase growth and changes to phase stabilities with changes to pressure and temperature. X-ray data collected over the course of the experiment was carefully documented and described with the assistance of Dr. Crichton.</p><p>The starting materials, pressure-temperature conditions at quench, and minerals produced are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Table 1. Experiment Starting materials Pressure (GPa), Temperature (K) at quench Minerals synthesized Run 1 KLB-1 natural 10 GPa, 1600K Diopside, clinoenstatite, garnet, olivine Run 2 KLB-1 natural 15 GPa, 1700K Diopside, clinoenstatite, garnet, wadsleyite Run 3 KLB-1 natural 15.4 GPa, 1700-1850K Diopside, clinoenstatite, garnet, wadsleyite Run 4 KLB-1 synthetic 17 GPa, 2000 Majorite, wadsleyite</p><p>The four run products were taken to the American Museum of Natural History in New York for mounting, polishing, and chemical analysis using the electron microprobe (EMPA). The mineral phases present have large, well-formed crystals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-d</ref>; SEM images) and EMPA confirms homogenous and well-equilibrated compositions. However, garnet grains have not equilibrated well, likely because of heating times were too short to allow for this. Run 4, using the synthetic starting material, resulted in small grain sizes and differences in composition to the natural counterparts. This experiment will require further investigation to understand why differences exist between the natural and synthetic starting compositions. 1c. Run 3 1b. Run 4</p><p>The findings from these experiments support previous unpublished work we have done using a natural KLB-1 starting mixture. This work is currently being written up for publication and we will incorporate the study conducted at ESRF into this work. We continue to discuss the results with ESRF scientists Crichton and Rosenthal to help interpret the results and develop ideas for additional publication and collaboration related to this work. The data will be used to re-evaluate the phase diagram for the transition zone, particularly where clinoenstatite transforms to a garnet structure, with implications for seismological observations of the mantle, thermodynamic models for phase equilibria, and the paragenetic relationships and depths of origin for sublithospheric diamonds.</p><p>The PI is deeply grateful to ESRF for this amazing opportunity and in particular to the ID06 for their scientific and technical support and collaboration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
