<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Two different types emitters (550 and 690 nm) have been identified in thermally (auto)reduced silver exchange LTA zeolites with promising perspectives for various applications such as biocompatible labels for intracellular imaging. Structural information suggested that Ag 6 + clusters with a doublet electronic ground state are associated with the appearance of the 690-nm emitter whereas the 550-nm emitter was tentatively assigned to Ag 3 + clusters. In parallel current investigations of the catalytic properties of these Ag LTAzeolites have shown that these materials reduced at high temperature featured promising performances in catalyzing CO oxidation at room temperature. In both applications the extent of the reduction process appears to be a crucial parameter in controlling the structure, charge and properties of the Ag clusters and the luminescence properties can be controlled by a precise treatment of the zeolites with H 2 or O 2 at various temperatures. More recently we have prepared series of bimetallic Ag/Au, Ag/Pd and Ag/Pt exchanged LTA zeolites that are expected to feature new luminescence properties with possibly different emission bands as well as improved performances and better stability over time.</p><p>Our previous in situ EXAFS investigation of Ag exchanged LTA zeolite carried out at Dubble beamline (see experimental report <ref type="bibr">26-01-865)</ref> showed that significant dynamic local structural changes were occurring around silver atoms during a simple heat treatment in air up to 450 ºC as shown in the Fourier transforms of Ag3Na-LTA zeolite. According to the reduction temperature two cationic Ag clusters possessing a complex structure presenting an Ag core with unusually short Ag-Ag distances have been identified. The smaller cluster, likely formed inside the sodalite cages, emits light at 550-nm while the larger one produces a 690-nm luminescence. However the detailed EXAFS analysis has revealed that a significant level of beam damage has been caused to some of the clusters.</p><p>This has led us, in addition to the bimetallic samples, to measured a second time a series of pure Ag LTA materials under different conditions to take into account the beam effect. XAFS data have been collected in transmission mode at Ag K-edge (25514 eV) and up to k= 14 Å -2 with typical acquisition times of 45 min (1 to 20 s/point) corresponding to a very good signal to noise ratio. Ionization chambers were filled with Ar/He gas mixture. Due to limitations of the Si (111) monochromator, the energy resolution at Ag K-edge did not exceed ca. 1.5 eV in the XANES regions. Except for the in situ measurements, 4 spectra were averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio to an optimal level. A set of samples have been measured as-prepared as self-supported pellets whereas 3 samples have been measured in situ in capillaries under various gas flows and temperatures. We have used the integrated gas rig system recently installed at Dubble to mimic the laboratory treatment of the zeolites at different temperatures and under H 2 and O 2 gas flows. The temperature provided with a N 2 heater gun has been raised up to 550ºC at a rate of 5 ºC / with 4 plateaus at RT, 150, 450 and 550 ºC programmed for combined XANES and EXAFS measurements. Dubble gas rig has proved to be very efficient and flexible to use although a faulty mass flow controller and a leaking gas pipe have prevented us from completing our last planned in situ measurements.  The EXAFS and XANES data have now been analyzed and the structural results are being correlated with detailed luminescence and absorption measurements as well as DFT theoretical modeling that is currently underway.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
