<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The relationship between hyperfine interactions and magnetism in fully ordered double-perovskites A 2 NiMnO 6 (A = Sc, In, Tl) is investigated by nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) with the 61 Ni transition, and compared to neutron diffraction measurements <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. In these perovskite-like oxides, the increased octahedral (Ni 2+ O 6 ) and (Mn 4+ O 6 ) tilting associated with decreasing A-site ionic radius (Tl 3+ →In 3+ →Sc 3 ) is a key ingredient in changing the sign of the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ni-O-Mn magnetic interactions.</p><p>In the case of Sc 2 NiMnO 6 with antiferromagnetic NN-interactions, exhibiting two magnetic transitions at 35 K and 17 K, the magnitude and sign of the magnetic hyperfine field (B hf ) on 61 Ni nuclei is determined using NFS measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The measurements of Sc 2 NiMnO 6 at 4.6, 14.9, 23.8 and 33.2 K were done at the magnetic region and above Neel point at 39.7 K (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a-e</ref>). The 39.7 K spectrum (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>) fit suggests that there is no measurable quadrupole splitting in the sample. The effective thickness of the sample was obtained from dynamical beats as L=5.68. L=µ n *z*f LM , where µ n = 0.00868 µm -1 -nuclear absorption factor, z -sample thickness, f LM -Lamb-Mossbauer factor. Using z=2000 µm, obtain f LM = 0.33 <ref type="bibr">(Fig 2b)</ref>.</p><p>The spectra below Neel temperature were fitted with 2 models: (1) one site with isotopically distributed magnetic field, (2) the site with magnetic splitting and the site with single line (non-magnetic). The second model was used to check possible transition of the Ni to the paramagnetic state above anomaly temperature around 17K. The parameters of the fit were scaling factor I 0 , time zero dt, Lamb-Mossbauer factor f LM (describing line broadening), hyperfine magnetic field B hf , and the relative contribution of the non-magnetic site a2 (see figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>). All fits were done using Motif software <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The fit of the data by these two models are shown for several temperatures in the Fig. <ref type="figure">1a-d</ref>, where red color corresponds to the first model, blue color -to the second model. Obtain the both models fit quite well measured data. Presence of the non-magnetic site is completely absent below 19K and is of the order of 1-2% between 20 and 40 K. Temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field, Lamb-Mossbauer factor and contribution of the non-magnetic site are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows NFS spectrum of Sc 2 NiMnO 6 sample was measured at 5 K with applied vertical field of B ex = 6 T. This spectrum was fitted using 2 models: (1) assuming that all magnetic moments aligned along the field (ferromagnetic alignment). In this case, one would expect that only lines with ∆m=0 will be present in the spectrum. Parameters of the fit here are total hyperfine magnetic field and additional broadening; (2)assuming that field does not affect isotropic distribution of magnetic moments, model with integrates over isotropic distribution with additional external field of 6T in vertical direction (antiferromagnetic alignment).</p><p>The small absolute value of the field B hf,2.5K ≈ 6.0 T on Ni 2+ ions in the octahedral oxygen coordination is explained by the large positive orbital contribution (B L &gt; 0) due to the 3d-4p orbital mixing via spin-orbit coupling. The negative sign of B hf in the external field underlines that the core polarization (B F ≈ -13 T) is the most important partial contribution to the experimental magnetic hyperfine field. The temperature evolution of the reduced hyperfine fields B hf (T) is reproduced by the Brillouin function (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) with S = 1 and magnetic transition temperature of 38(2) K, that is incompatible with the earlier assumption [1] that the low temperature transition at T N2 ≈17 K arises from the antiferromagnetic ordering in Ni 2+ sublattice. The significantly lower values of the hyperfine field in the ferromagnet Tl 2 NiMnO 6 (B hf,5K ≈ 1.7 T) and In 2 NiMnO 6 (B hf,5K ≈ 2.1 T) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) with a cycloidal magnetic structure References 1) W.

Taking into account the angular dependence of the B STHF (ϑ) field on the Ni-O-Mn bond angle ϑ, we have shown that, in opposite to Sc 2 NiMnO 6 , the B STHF field in A = In, Tl perovskites have the positive sign, thus drastically reducing the resulting B hf value.</figDesc></figure>
