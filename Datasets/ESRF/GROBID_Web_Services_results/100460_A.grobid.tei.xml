<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A complete set of ex-situ specimens has been explored for pure and Bi-doped orthorhombic Nb2O5 as well as monoclinic Nb2O5 cycled electrodes, complemented by an in-situ XANES study for pure Nb2O5 in the voltage range of 1.0 -3.0 V. For the abovementioned materials, the Nb K-edge and Bi L3-edge were investigated. A so far preliminary analysis of the results signifies that: i) The Nb K-edge for orthorhombic Nb2O5 shows an evident change in structure and local environment during the initial cycle, and the structure remained stable in the next few cycles; ii) the Bi in the Bi-doped samples shows a reduction to the metallic state and, possibly, alloying with lithium, which may be the reason for the higher capacity; iii) monoclinic Nb2O5 retains its original structure in the first cycle, which can explain the high initial Coulombic efficiency. We anticipate that these findings, following a detailed analysis, will provide us with an in-depth understanding of the structural transformations that are contributing to the electrochemical processes in orthorhombic/monoclinic Nb2O5 as well as the role of the bismuth dopant and, thus, help with the development of high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The realization of high-performance lithium-ion batteries has been a hot spot of intense research in order to satisfy the inevitable tendency towards a net-zero carbon emission landscape. Graphite, the state-ofthe-art commercial anode, is limited by its intrinsic sluggish kinetics, which leads to lithium plating during fast charging, especially at low temperatures. Considering the fast charging properties, insertion-type anodes, such as Nb2O5, are ideal candidates for next-generation batteries. However, the reported specific capacity of Nb2O5, cycled in a rather narrow voltage range, remained relatively low so far. When the voltage window of orthorhombic Nb2O5 is extended to 0.01 -3.0 V, the specific capacity can be doubled while retaining promising cycling performance. Bi doping increases the capacity even further compared with pure orthorhombic Nb2O5. Moreover, another crystalline type -monoclinic Nb2O5 -displays a better initial Coulombic efficiency. Therefore, to unveil the lithium storage mechanism in the extended voltage range of different Nb2O5-based materials, we have performed a detailed X-ray absorption spectroscopy study. Pellets of the pristine materials and model compounds as well as several cycled electrodes upon the first cycled and after several cycles were prepared and measured for all three materials. We also prepared pouch cells with the same electrodes for operando experiments. Even though we managed to run the pouch cells in the narrow voltage of 1.0 -3.0 V, we have experienced issues with the extended voltage range. These issues have not been observed in our previous experiments and were, therefore, not anticipated. Currently, we are investigating the reasons for the bad electrochemical performance. At present, most likely are different properties of the carbon-based current collector owing to a new supplier or issues with the lithium metal due to some power failure of the dry room prior to the experiment.</p><p>Anyhow, the results of the ex-situ study of electrodes prepared in an Ar-filled glove box with the O2 and H2O levels below 0.1 ppm have provided detailed insights into the structural transformation in the initial cycle for orthorhombic and monoclinic samples and provide the information of the role of bismuth doping to some extent. Overall, the analysis so far has been rather qualitative and so is the discussion herein, whereas a more detailed interpretation of the EXAFS data sets requires more time.</p><p>Starting from orthorhombic Nb2O5 samples, we can see from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> that, upon lithiation, the position of Nb main edge shifts to lower energy, confirming that the oxidation states of niobium is reduced during lithiation. Upon delithiation, the oxidation state of Nb shifts back to higher energy; however, the XANES features of Nb K-edge are different after the first de-lithiation process, suggesting that an irreversible structural change occurs. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>  Operando XAS data are shown in figures 2a-2d, the results are coherent with the ex-situ spectra. However, the precise determination of the oxidation states and coordination nature of Nb requires a more detailed analysis, which is currently underway.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>-3c indicate that, qualitatively speaking, the evolution of Nb in Bi-doped Nb2O5 is quite similar to pure Nb2O5. Interestingly, the Bi L3-edge (Figure <ref type="figure">3d</ref>) reveals that the bismuth is reduced to the metallic state during lithiation, probably leading to the increased capacity of this system. The reversibility of this alloying process, however, needs to be better understood and investigated. a) b) c) d) Figure 3. Ex-situ spectra of Bi-doped Nb2O5 cycled electrodes (a) Nb K-edge spectra in the first two cycles, comparison between pure orthorhombic Nb 2 O 5 and Bi-doped (b) at fully lithiated state, (c) at fully delithiated state, (d) the evolution of Bi L3-edge upon de-/lithiation. Lastly, Figure 4a describes the first cycle voltage profile of monoclinic Nb2O5 based on different "hold" voltages. Figure 4b and 4c show a reversible feature in the first cycle. To summarize, the analysis of data collected from this experiment is still at an early stage, but given the insightful information from ex-situ spectra, we consider that the experiment was successful. The preliminary data analysis illustrates that: i) the structural change happens in the first cycle and then become stable upon cycling for orthorhombic Nb2O5; ii) the alloy process of bismuth doping upon lithiation contributes to higher capacity; iii) the unchanged structure of monoclinic Nb2O5 somewhat results in initial Coulombic efficiency and good cycling performance. Accordingly, the collected data bear important information for the further improvement of anodes based on insertion-type mechanism for nextgeneration lithium-ion batteries. A further step yielding a deeper insight into these systems is the collection of operando data which could not be measured during the experiment due to issues probably related to the cell preparation. We would like to mention that we are very satisfied with the high-quality spectra collected at the LISA beamline and professionalism of the beamline scientists and staff.</p><p>(a) (b) (c)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
