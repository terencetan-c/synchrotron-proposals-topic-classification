<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The proposed experiment aimed to resolve, for the first time, the local atomic fluctuation in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). The key focus is the influence of atomic contributions on the intrinsic plasticity, hence detailed analysis of the corresponding structural variations in the medium and short range order was planned. Despite the fact that monolithic BMGs are intrinsically brittle, some of them undergoes large compressive plastic deformation and this is favored by local fluctuation of the atomic arrangements. High deformations of BMGs can be attained only if numerous shear bands are formed. The such-named shear transformation zones (STZs) serve as nucleation sites for the shear bands. The ability of a region to undergo a shear transformation depends on the local microstructure. The STZs occur preferentially in soft regions in BMGs and evolve into shear bands upon loading. Further, the shear-band propagation is impeded by the hard regions. This impedance alters the propagating directions and assists shear-band multiplication, postponing the catastrophic failure and enhancing the ductility. Therefore, to detect such local fluctuations and determine their nature is the crucial aspect to understand and to control the plastic deformability of BMGs. The collected X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was taken in computer tomography (CT) configuration and allow the calculation of pair distribution function (PDF). The XRD-PDF-CT approach was used for the first time on the BMG samples, with the purpose to map their structure at nanoscale. The experiment was designed for the following glassy alloy samples: Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Pt57.5Cu14.7Ni5.3P22.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> These BMGs show a relative large plastic deformation, which it is supposed to arise from a particular structure, consisting of an alternation of hard and soft zones, as shown in Fig.</p><p>1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, the discussion remains at the level of speculation and no real differences were detected in the TEM because the observations are strongly affected by the thinning rate of the sample, as well as the beam intensity, which do not allow for accurate measurements. Fig. 2 Amorphous phase-separated Gd27.5Hf27.5Co25Al20 sample. White: Hf-rich phase, black-Gd-rich phase</p><p>A main problem of the XRD-PDF-CT is that the diffraction data are prone to several measurement artefacts, which should be carefully analyzed and ruled-out. Therefore, during the allocated time, we performed several investigation, as detailed in the following.  Measurement algorithm: a line scan consisting of 51 equally distanced (i.e. at every 500 nm) points for every  rotation angle (CT approach). The rotation angle was set for  = 3°, so a total of 61 projections were taken.  The samples were placed in the rotation center of the hexapod sample holder, which was fixed on the piezoactivated table.  Defined a procedure to check if after every line scan and  rotation the samples comes back in the rotation center.  In order to prove the reliability of the method, a phase separated amorphous Gd27.5Hf27.5Co25Al20 sample, consisting of two amorphous phases (Hf rich and Gd rich, respectively, see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) was used as phantom sample.  In order to check the reliability of the method, every sample was line scanned as well for a  = 10°, in this way 19 projections were obtained.  The diffraction patterns were obtained upon radial and azimuthal integration of the 2D images recorded by a Frelon 4M pixels detector. The patterns must be corrected for the high-Q camera nonlinearity (the absorption of the X-ray beam in the phosphor screen may be less than 100% ("thin phosphor regime"), with a consequent detector response that depends on the incident angle and the effective thickness of the phosphor) as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Further, the corrected patterns are analyzed using the PDF-getX3 software.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Mihai STOICA * , Assoc.
