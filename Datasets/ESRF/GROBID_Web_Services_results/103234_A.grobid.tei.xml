<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>As mentioned in the proposal, the two objectives of this experiment were to :</p><p>-Identify complex phases of NiCrBSi alloy obtained by L-PBF -Establishing the equilibrium phases transformation sequence of NiCrBSi alloy</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase identification</head><p>According to the literature and our investigations, we suppose that the equilibrium structure of NiCrBSi alloy is composed of the Ni-rich matrix, CrB, Cr7C3, Ni3B, Ni2Si and Ni3Si. However, the microstructure of NiCrBSi produced by L-PBF is not described yet in the literature. Even with our investigations, nanometric crystals are still unidentified. Therefore, we utilised the angular resolution available at ID22. We studied the powder in order to obtain the diffraction patern of the raw material, a cast sample, 13 heat-treated cast samples, 9 L-PBF samples produced with different parameters and 13 heat-treated L-PBF samples. For all 14 cast samples, 5 measurements spaced out by 1 mm were required due to the heterogeneity. Those analyses were automatically performed during the night with the use of the robot arm. and Powder Diffraction File (PDF). Therefore, we followed advices of Jonathan Wright and created phases that match the diffraction pattern by tweaking cell parameters. The increase of preheating temperature on L-PBF samples does generate Ni3Si precipitates. Furthermore, high temperature preheating and laser remelting supresse the Ni31Si12 phase. In a similar way, we studied the influence of heat treatment on the microstructure. This work is still under progress but the method is dialed. Those data obtained at ID22 concerning cell parameters will be completed by XRD-CT performed at ID11 and local analysis via TEM-SAED-EELS / EBSD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equilibrium phase transformation sequence</head><p>No consensus concerning the equilibrium and non-equilibrium transformation sequence of NiCrBSi alloys during the solidification has been found in the litterature. According to our investigations via DTA, several transformations might appear between 950 and 1050 °C. Therefore, in situ, synchrotron XRD was performed on the powder at ID22 in order to determine the nature of those transformations. The radiation furnace developped at ID22 was used. A heating and cooling rate of 15 and 100 °C.min -1 were successfully explored until 1200 °C. Phase identification was done similarly to previously described. During heating, Ni31Si12 peaks disappeares around 600 °C and Ni3Si peaks appears at the same temperature. On the other hand, before melting, Ni3Si peaks disappears and Ni31Si12 peaks re-appears. Ni31Si12 is the first phase to melt followed by Ni3B, the Ni-rich matrix and CrB. During cooling, the Ni-rich matrix is the first phase to reappear at around 1100 °C followed by CrB, Ni3B and Ni31Si12. Furthermore, Ni3Si precipitates around 970 °C.</p><p>A similar analysis for data obtained at 100 °C.min -1 and at 50 °C.min -1 on the L-PBF sample are still to be performed but the method is dialed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The experiment was successfully carried on all samples. Phase identification was successfully carried and results match our expectations. Thus, they will be part of a paper concerning the microstructure of NiCrBSi produced by L-PBF and maybe another concerning heat treatments on those parts. In situ XRD analysis will be part of an article concerning equilibrium phase transformation of NiCrBSi alloy. Finally, those results will be part of my thesis concerning the understanding of NiCrBSi alloy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 Phase identification of a) the powder b) the L-PBF sample c) the cast sample.Compare to diffraction patterns previously obtained by conventionnal XRD, the angular resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio of those obtained at ID22 is far better. This angular resolution permit to separate intricated diffraction peak. Thus different phases were reliably identified. The powder and the L-PBF sample are composed by the Ni-rich matrix with CrB, Cr7C3, Ni3B, and Ni31Si12 phases. The cast sample is composed by the same phases but with added Ni3Si precipitates. It should be mentioned that cell parameters of those phases are slightly different compare with databases such as The Material Project (TMP), Crystallography Open Database (COD)</figDesc><graphic coords="1,34.00,585.38,533.50,106.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
