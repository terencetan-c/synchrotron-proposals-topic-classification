<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>High resolution powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the ternary X-Pt-Be phases have been successfully recorded at the BM20 Rossendorf beamline with a wavelength of Œª = 0.459317(1) √Ö. The diffractograms of X = Th, U, La could be indexed with a body-centered cubic unit cell with the lattice parameters a ‚âà 13.70 √Ö (T = 300 K). On cooling the lattice parameters showed a continuous decrease by about 1 % for T = 140 K, respectively, with no indication of a phase transition in this temperature range (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The data were indexed as a cubic body-centered unit cell and used to solve the crystal structure in the cubic space group ùêº4 ÔøΩ 3ùëë and refine the structure model. The high quality data enabled the localization of the light Be atoms next to the heavy atoms. The final structure model agreed nicely with the experimental powder pattern (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The isostructural compounds constitute new complex intermetallic compounds with over 200 atoms per unit cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The obtained structural data will enable a deeper understanding of the physical properties and serve as input to calculate the electronic structure of these compounds.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
