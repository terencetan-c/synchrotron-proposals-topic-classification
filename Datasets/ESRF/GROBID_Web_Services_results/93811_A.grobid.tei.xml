<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of the experiment was to carry out high pressure (HP) XAS measurements at the L 3edges of Ce and Mo in the magnetic layered compound Mo 4 Ce 4 Al 7 C 3 . In particular, we wanted to assess the evolution of the Ce mixed valence up to 40 GPa, and to see if some of the electronic charge leaving the Ce 4f orbital as pressure (P) increase was transferred to the Mo 4d orbital. We had also planned on measuring the evolution of the XMCD signal at the Ce L 3,2 -edge as a function of P, but a technical issue with the cryo-magnet kept us from performing these measurements.</p><p>A preliminary HP XANES experiment had been conducted on the Ce L 3 -edge at ID12, with P going up to around 20 GPa. This showed a linear evolution of the 4f valence from ~0.75 (i.e 75% of the Ce atoms in the 4f 1 configuration, the rest in 4f 0 ) down to ~0.55 at 20 GPa. At this point, our hypothesis was that one of the two non-equivalent Ce lattice sites was fully 4f 1 and carried the ferromagnetism of the compound, while the other one was 4f 0 and in a mixed valence state. This implied that passed a certain applied pressure, this mixed valence site would be fully emptied of its 4f electronic charge, bringing the total valence of the compound to 0.5. This called for a new HP experiment going to at least 30 GPa, giving us a chance to witness this saturation at 0.5. This was done using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) with a partially perforated diamond, in order to increase the signal. The resulting XANES spectra as well as the evolution of the valence as a function of pressure are displayed on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (a) and (b), respectively. There is a stabilisation at a valence of ~0.5, which proves the assumption mentionned above.</p><p>The HP study at the L 3 -edge of Mo was conducted using a fully perforated diamond, along with a thin diamond window. Indeed, given the considerable absorption in diamond at the energy of this edge, a partially perforated diamond would not allow for a good signal. This causes experimental constraints, and limits the attainable pressure at around 10 GPa. Nevertheless, as can be seen on figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, there is not a strong evolution of the shape or intensity of the white line as a funtion of pressure, which tells us that the Mo 4d valence remains quite stable up to 6.5 GPa.</p><p>Both these results will be published in a letter that will be submitted this autumn.
