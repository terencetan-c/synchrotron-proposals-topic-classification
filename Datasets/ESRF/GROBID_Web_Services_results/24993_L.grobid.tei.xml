<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cytokinins are a diverse class of compounds that are essential for plant growth. Cytokinin dehydrogenase (CKX) has a major role in the control of the levels of these plant hormones by catalysing their irreversible oxidation. The crystal structure of Zea mays CKX displays the same two-domain topology of the</p></div>

The X-ray analysis reveals a bipartite architecture of the catalytic centre, which consists of an internal cavity lined by the flavin ring and a funnel shaped region on the protein surface. A pore with a diameter of about 4 Å connects the two sub-sites. Snapshots of two critical steps along the reaction cycle were obtained through the elucidation of the complexes with a slowly reacting substrate and the reaction product, which correspond to the states immediately before (Michaelis complex) and after (product complex) oxidation has taken place. The substrate displays a "plug-into-socket" binding mode that seals the catalytic site and precisely positions the carbon atom undergoing oxidation in close contact with the reactive locus of the flavin. A polarising H-bond between the substrate amine group and an Asp-Glu pair may facilitate oxidation. Substrate to product conversion results in small atomic movements that lead to a planar conformation of the reaction product allowing double bond conjugation. The mechanism of amine oxidation in CKX differs from that observed in other flavin-dependent amine oxidases.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
