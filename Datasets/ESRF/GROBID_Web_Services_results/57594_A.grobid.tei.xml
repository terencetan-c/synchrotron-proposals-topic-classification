<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of the experiment conducted at ID19 in February 2016 was to capture the rapid failure mechanisms of commercial lithium-ion battery designs using high speed X-ray radiography. Lithium ion batteries can fail in particularly catestrophic ways, which can bypass integrated safety devices and containment strategies. The mechanism of battery failure is not well understood and therefore the magnitude of catestrophic failure is neither easily predicted nor controlled. We aim to elucidate key failure mechanisms that cause catestrophic failure and the efficacy of integrated safety devices for improving battery safety.</p><p>Our experimental setup consisted of a customised battery nail penetration system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) that clamped the tested cells in line with the X-ray beam. The clamped batteries could then be subject to mechanical abuse (in the form of nail penetrations or crushing), thermal abuse (through application of high resistance heating wires), or electrical abuse (by connecting the battery terminals to a power source) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). A thermal camera located at the rear of the nail penetration system simultaneously recorded a live feed of the surface temperature of the batteries being tested (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). A high flow-rate air pump was connected to the chamber in which the batteries were failed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) that extracted the generated gases outside. An additional vent cover was placed above the nail penetraion system to help capture any other escaping gases. The thermal camera, nail penetration system, electrical power, clamps, heating and ventilation were controlled from outside the hutch. Over the duration of the 4 day experiment over 100 batteries were safely and successfully failed during various different abuse tests and studies. The beamline was very simple to operate and there were no setbacks experienced. The high energy and high flux of ID19 allowed us to capture even faster phenomena than what was expected at more than 10,000 frames per secondthis allowed us to capture the most rapid failure mechanims; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the an example where vent clogging was seen to cause the rupture of a commercial 18650 cell (captured at 18,000 Hz). We completed all of our proposed tests during the allocated beamtime and are currently disseminating the results. Certain causes of catestrophic failure have been identified and we aim to disseminate this research through high impact publications over the coming months. This was a highly technologically and logistically challenging experiment that has shown very promising results. We thank the ESRF, as well as Alexander Rack and Marco DiMichiel who were exceptionally helpful during and leading up to this experiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1(a) Rear view of the nail penetration system showing placement of the thermal camera.
