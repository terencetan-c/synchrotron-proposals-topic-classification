<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The catalytic mechanism of phosphorylase kinase probed by mutational studies.</p><p>The contributions to catalysis of the conserved catalytic aspartate (Asp149) in the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (PhK; residues 1-298) have been studied by kinetic and crystallographic methods. Kinetic studies in solvents of different viscosity show that PhK, like cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase, exhibits a mechanism in which the chemical step of phosphoryl transfer is fast and the rate limiting step is release of the products, ADP and phosphoprotein, and possibly viscosity dependent conformational changes.</p><p>Site directed mutagenesis of Asp149 to Ala and Asn resulted in enzymes with a small increase in K m for glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) and ATP substrates and dramatic decreases in k cat (1.3 x 10 4 for Asp149Ala and 4.7 x 10 3 for Asp149Asn mutants, respectively). Viscosometric kinetic measurements with the Asp149Asn mutant showed a reduction in the rate-limiting step for release of products by 4.5 x 10 3 and a significant decrease (possibly as great as 2.2 x 10 3 ) in the rate constant characterising the chemical step. The date combined with the crystallographic evidence for the ternary PhK-AMPPNP-peptide complex (Lowe et al (1997) EMBO J. 6, 6646-6658) provide powerful support for the role of the carboxyl of Asp149 in binding and orientation of the substrate and in catalysis of phosphoryl transfer. The constitutively active subunit PhK has a glutamate (Glu182) residue in the activation segment, in place of a phosphorylatable serine, threonine or tyrosine residue in other protein kinases that are activated by phosphorylation. Site directed mutagenesis of Glu182 and other residues involved in a hydrogen bond network resulted in mutant proteins (Glu182Ser, Arg148Ala, Tyr206Phe) with decreased catalytic efficiency (approximate average decrease in k cat /K m by 20 fold). The crystal structure of the mutant Glu182Ser at 2.6 Å resolution (final statistics in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) showed a phosphate dianion about 2.6 Å from the position previously occupied by the carboxylate of Glu182. There was no change in tertiary structure from the native protein but the activation segment in the region C-terminal to residue 182 showed increased disorder, indicating that correct localisation of the activation segment is necessary in order to recognise and present the protein substrate for catalysis.</p><p>Table 1.
