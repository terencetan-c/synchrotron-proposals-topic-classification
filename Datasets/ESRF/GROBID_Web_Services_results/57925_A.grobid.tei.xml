<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A reduction of copper containing water redution catalysts (Cu WRC's) to metallic Cu occurs during the illumnination of UV-Vis light in presence of Ir photosensitizers (IR-PS's). Aim of these experiments was to correlate the redox properties of the catalysts with their activity in water splitting. Three different systems</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>were investigated in a systematic manner: CuI which showed the highest activity, copper(II) species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) with a medium activity and the nearly inactive CuO. A clear relationsship between the reducibility of the copper species and the activity can be established with the XAFS meausurements performed at this beamtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental description</head><p>Experiments on both edges, Cu K (8.9 keV) and Ir L III (11.2 keV) edges under light on and off conditions were performed. Our experiments were focussed on the Cu K edge due to the technicals problems at the beamtime at January 2015 (CH-4235).</p><p>The experimental setup was based on a reaction cell with two movable glassy carbon (HTW Hochtemperatur-Werkstoffe GmbH, Thierhaupten) to optimize the X-ray path through the sample. For the illumination a movable UV-Vis light source (Lumatec, 1.5 W Xe lamp) were used. It was possible to perform the XAS investigation with or without light using a UV shutter. Spectra were collected in both modi, with and without light. An advantage of the used setup was that it allows measurements without any perturbation by the hydrogen gas bubbles produced under UV irradiation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) For the in situ experiments the catalysts (160 µmol Cu for CuI and Cu/MCM-41; 120 µmol for CuO) and the Iridium photosensitizer (Ir(ppy) 2 (bpy), 60µmol) were added to the reactor. Then a solution of tetrahydrofurane (THF), triethylamine (TEA) and water (3:2:1, 30 ml) was added to the vessel. Afterwards, the reaction was started. In each sequence of 60 s eight spectra with and one spectrum without illuminaton were collected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>The XANES results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. CuI was measured for in total 70 min, Cu 2+ /MCM-41 and CuO for more than 200 min. Not all measured spectra are shown, the measurement time of one spectra is 10 s.</p><p>A clear correlation between the reducibility of the Cu compound and the catalytic activity could be established. At CuI at the beginn a mixture between Cu + and Cu 2+ were found confirming the former results obtained at BM 23 1 , for both other samples at the begin only Cu 2+ was observed as expected. During the illumination CuI is significantly reduced to Cu 0 , whereas for Cu 2+ /MCM-41 only a slight reduction and for CuO no reduction was observed. It can be stated clearly from these observation, that the more reducible the Cu is, the more active the sample is. Surprisingly, for CuI the reduction of the Cu was not finished after 20 min and slower as we observed in former investigations. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In contrast to these investigations, the amount of reduced Cu is much higher at this recent investigations. The most probable reason for these differences are the different reaction cell design we used for the different studies. At BM 23 we used a cappilary, for this recent measurements we used the reaction cell described above which allows measurements under conditions which are more realistic with the conditions in a "usual" chemistry lab or for further applications.  0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 1,2 1,4 1,6 8970 9000 9030 8970 9000 9030 Normalized Intensity / a.u.

The inset shows the increase of the reduced species for Cu 2+ / MCM-41 (marked by the cirlce).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>It could be shown that XAFS measurements are possible at ID 24 with a time resolution less than 1 sec or for low-concentrated samples with a time resolution in the second range. A clear relationsship between reducibility of the Cu species and their activity in water splitting could be established. The new reaction cell design allows measurements under realistic conditions for homogeneous and for heterogeneous systems with liquid/solid phases. One still existing problem is the data reduction and evaluation for the high amount of spectra meausred at such beamtime. It would be very helpful for the user, if the ESRF (or other members of the community) will find a good solution for this problem.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>1 H.
