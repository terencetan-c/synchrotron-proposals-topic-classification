We used for the first time the "column electrochemical cell" which has been specially designed and built for in situ SXRD during electrochemical process, experiments where an important quantity of electrolyte in front of the electrode is needed.</p><p>Working at grazing incidence, we firstly and successfully recorded the surface signal of Au( <ref type="formula">111</ref> To follow the Pd growth, we measured the diffracted signal at the anti-Bragg position (0,1,0.5) as a function of the time (of the deposition rate); Even if the quantitative analysis has just began (the experiment has been made at the end of June 2010), the recorded signals already allow to have some qualitative results.</p><p>The diffraction signal recorded for (0,1,0.5) sweeping the applied potential form 0.7 vs. SCE down to 0.4 vs. SCE at 0.1 mV/sec (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) shows a first oscillation, corresponding to the first complete deposited Pd layer, followed by a second one. It seems that a layer-by-layer growth is present for the two first deposited layers. We could verify that the first oscillation corresponds to the UPD peak we observe in the electrochemical deposition.</p><p>We recorded the diffraction signal in the (0,1,0.5) position for different chloride concentrations and different deposition rates, showing a strong influence of these parameters on the Pd layers growth mecanismes. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: In situ measurements on Au(111) (H 2 SO 4 0.1 M, 0.7 V vs. SCE): rocking scan measured for (0,1,0.5).</figDesc></figure>
