<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Brain tumours are still one of the main causes of death. In order to successfully combat the disease, it is extremely important to learn about the mechanism of its formation. It is believed that trace elements such as Fe, Cu and Zn play a significant role in neoplastic processes. Although present in the human body at low concentrations, trace elements are necessary for its proper functioning. These elements are present in enzymes and hormones and thus affect the metabolic processes that occur in cells. For this reason, information on the differences in their levels and forms in healthy and cancerous tissues with various malignancy grades may significantly contribute to the knowledge of biochemical reactions involved in oncogenesis.</p><p>The samples under study were collected intraoperatively and contained brain tumours with different malignancy grades. The tissues were placed in specially designed polypropylene rings in diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 1 mm. The front and the end of the ring are flat and covered by ultralene foil. Afterwards, the samples were immediately frozen to -80°C, which prevents all biological and chemical processes, e.g., oxidation. Altogether six samples of brain gliomas with various malignancy grades, including glioblastoma multiforme, oligodendroglioma anaplasticum, meningeoma monstrocellulare, meningeoma meningotheliale, astrocytoma diffusum and astrocytoma anaplasticum were analysed. Additionally, one metastasis and one non-cancerous control sample were measured. Inorganic reference materials (Fe, Cu and Zn foils, Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 •nH 2 O, FeSO 4 •7H 2 O, CuO, Cu 2 O and ZnO and organic reference materials (hemoglobin and transferrin) were examined.</p><p>The experiment was performed at beamline BM23 dedicated for X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The beam was monochromated with a Si(111) monochromator. The final beam spot size on the sample was about 7x1 mm. Special conditions were designed to avoid radiation damage. Containers with samples were placed in a liquid-helium cryostat (temperature about 20K) in a helium atmosphere. Absorption spectra of Fe were taken using incident radiation energies ranging from 7.0 to 7.7 keV, the spectra of Cufrom 8.9 to 9.6 keV and those of Znfrom 9.6 to 10.3 keV. The measurements were performed in fluorescent mode. The fluorescence radiation was collected by a 13-element Ge detector.</p><p>The first part of the measurements was intended to study the effect of sample preparation on the results obtained. For this purpose, metastatic cancer (adenocarcinoma metastaticum) material was used to prepare two identical samples, one of which was cleaned of blood. In both samples, EXAFS spectra were measured for Fe, Cu and Zn. Analysis of the spectra showed that the absorption edge positions for each of the elements did not significantly differ between the rinsed and unrinsed samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Neither were any significant differences found in the chemical environment of the analyzed elements between the two samples. It can be concluded that the contribution of the signal from blood present in the sample is negligible as compared to the signal from the tissue, which is important [from the point of view of/for] further preparation of samples.</p><p>The key findings from these measurements relate to the oxidation state and the chemical environment of iron in the samples. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the energies at which the absorption edges for the tumour samples with different malignancy grades were found. These energies were estimated from the XANES spectra using a mathematical "centre of gravity" of the absorption curve. A trend can be observed that the higher the tumour grade, the more Fe 2+ as compared to Fe 3+ the sample contains. Analysis of EXAFS spectra showed that the distance at which the atoms of the first coordination zone are located slightly increases with the increase in the tumour malignancy grade (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Further analysis will attempt to model the chemical environment of iron in tumour samples.</p><p>Analysis of EXAFS spectra of Cu and Zn showed differences in the chemical environment of these elements. As very few samples have been measured so far further studies are needed.
