Using resistivity and optical reflectivity measurements it was found that ultra-short laser pulses induce a new charge density wave (CDW) phase in 1T-TaS 2 , which is persistent and does not exist under normal equilibrium conditions.</p><p>Up to now nothing is known about the microscopic structure of this new laser-induced CDW. Hence, our goal was to use x-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to determine the modulation wave vector (q-vector), the correlation length and amplitude of the hidden CDW state. Note that we had a preliminary attempt for this experiment in May 2015 (see experimental report HC1957). In the following paragraph we will explain the improvements and achievements that have been made with respect to this previous experiment.</p><p>Starting from high quality bulk single crystals we prepared thin films of 1T-TaS 2 by mechanical exfoliation. These samples were deposited on 200 nm thick Si0 2 membranes spanning a 1 x 1 mm 2 hole in a silicon waver.</p><p>The thickness of the films was about 100 nm and typical lateral dimensions were 200 µm. The SiO 2 membranes provided much better support for the 1T-TaS 2 thin films then the previously used TEM grids and, hence, significantly improved the quality of the XRD data. In order to measure the electrical resistivity in-situ it was planned to fabricate contacts on the thin film samples using electron beam lithography. However, the fabrication of these contacts is very complex and demanding and needs to be developed iteratively. We managed to produce the first reliable contacts only several weeks after the beamtime, so that at the time of the beamtime the contacts were not available. Nonetheless, in order to get at least a qualitative macroscopic signature of the hidden state we contacted the samples using conductive paint which allowed for two point measurements (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 (a)</ref>).</p><p>The silicon waver was then clued on a sample holder which was mounted on the coldfinger of a continuous flow helium cryostat (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 (b)</ref>). We passed a current of 10µA through the sample using a Keithley 6220 current source and measured the voltage with a Keithley 2000 multimeter. A simple one-circle goniometer was used to rotate the sample.</p><p>The sample was exposed to a (60 x 100) µm 2 X-ray beam with a photon energy of 18keV. The XRD from the sample was collected with a rayonix MX170 detector. In order to optically pump the sample a Ti-sapphire laser with a wavelength of 800nm and pulse lengths of about 1ps was used. The laser beam had a size of about (1 x 1) mm 2 . At first we checked the crystallographic quality of our samples at room temperature. Therefore, we collected single crystal datasets consisting of up to 160 images measured over a sample rotation of 40 degree. Typical reciprocal space maps deduced from these datasets are shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 (a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Next we cooled the sample slowly down to 5K (1K/min) while measuring the resistivity. However, the conductive paint contacts were not stable enough and broke during cooling which prevented the resistivity measurement. We tried several cooling cycles with different samples but the contacts always failed. At 5K we again collected datasets over a sample rotation of 40 degree (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 (c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>)). As in our earlier attempt, the data clearly confirm the high crystallographic quality of our thin film samples. In our previous beamtime (HC1957) we used a helium CryoJet to cool the sample which turned out to be inappropriate as it could not reach the needed temperature below 30K and lead to shacking of the sample which disturbed the XRD measurement. These problems have indeed been solved by using the cryostat which provided a very stable sample temperature without disturbing the diffraction experiment. With this improvement and the use of the SiO 2 membranes as sample substrates, the experiment yields the desired q-space resolution also for temperatures below 5K which is necessary in order to study the switching into the hidden state. We could observe the expected superlattice peaks corresponding to the nearly commensurate CDW (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 (a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>)) and the commensurate CDW (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 (c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>)) at room temperature and 5K, respectively. In particular the intensity distribution along the crystallographic l-direction, i.e. perpendicular to the TaS 2 -layers, is well resolved (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 (b</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>)). These information are indispensable in order to elucidate the CDW layer stacking order and are commonly difficult to obtain from electron diffraction.</p><p>However, technical difficulties with the beamline delayed the actual setup of this complex experiment by 5 shifts. We conducted several cooling cycles with small cooling rates in order to prevent breakage of the conductive paint contacts which also took a substantial amount of time. In addition, we had to ascertain that the cryostat mount was not stable enough so that rotating the sample led to unreproducible movements. Therefore, the actual measurements took much longer than expected because the sample position needed to be realigned every two degrees. With the little amount of time available to us it was not possible to reinforce the cryostat mount. In the end, we had only the last two shifts left to optically pump the sample. However, due to misalignment between the position of laser and x-ray beam we could not conduct the planned measurement .</p><p>Nonetheless, this and our previous attempt clearly show that the proposed experiment is very well feasible.</p><p>Many technical difficulties have been solved in this second attempt and we are in close contact with the beamline staff in order to address the remaining issues. It should be noted that the development of such a highly nonstandard and complex experiment is very challenging and certainly needs some iterations. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a): 1T-TaS2 sample on a SiO2 membrane with conductive paint patches.
