<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>mesoporous SiO 2 nanoparticles has also been undertaken but first estimation of uptake capacity is inconclusive. We suspect that functionalization with aminocarboxylate functions has not occurred with the expected rate. This report is therefore based on results obtained with PEI derivatives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>FT-IR data for the commercial PEI and functionalized PEI-C and PEI-P have been recorded and show unambiguously the presence of carboxylate and phosphate functions (the presence of phosphate function is however more difficult to assess because the phosphorous bands overlap with the amine bands). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents a scheme of both polymers with an estimation of polymerization rate. An estimate of the total molecular weight has also been performed for PEIC-C (58 kDa) and the functionalization rate has been found to be around 89 % using 13 C NMR. IR spectra have also been recorded in the presence of uranyl and show that complexation occurs. Uptake curves (load curves) are currently being recorded. Several conditions (pH, synthetic conditions) have been explored and EXAFS at the U L III edge (pH 4 and physiological pH) has been recorded in solution around mMolar concentrations. The Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectrum of the PEI-C complex with uranyl at physiological pH is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> with corresponding fit. The best fit data lead to 2 O yl at 1.78 Å (σ² : 0,0026 Å²); 6 O eq at 2.36 Å (σ² : 0.0152 Å²); 1.7 C bid at 3.43(2) Å, (σ² : 0.0065 Å²) and 2.4 C mon at 2.89(4) Å (σ² : 0.0045 Å²) (S 0 ²=1.0, e0 = 6.52 eV, Rfactor = 0.4%). The data clearly show that both bidentate and monodentate carboxylic functions are bound to the uranyl cation. A fit without a mixing of bidentate and monodentate functions did not lead to a satisfactory agreement. The average U-O eq distance is in agreement with data reported in the literature : 2.28 Å for monodentate 2.46 Å for bidentate carboxylates 6 . In order to complement the structural study, a Molecular Dynamics model is also currently being calculated in collaboration with ICSM (CEA Marcoule). The adjustment of the complex PEI-P with uranyl at physiological pH is more problematic. First of all it shows the presence of clusters of uranyl like in the U-AMP (AMP = adenosine phosphate) complex. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> In this structure the cluster is composed 3 uranyl at a distance of 3.92 Å from each other. In the adjustment, the U---U distance is equal to 3.85 Å. But there is also an additional contribution of Br atoms at 2.42 Å that corresponds to the presence of bromopropylphosphonic acid that has been used in the synthesis of the polymer. This impurity that enters the uranyl coordination sphere was unexpected and another synthetic route without bromine is currently being tested. Nevertheless the occurrence of a tri-uranyl cluster with PEI-P is very surprising and must be further explored. A publication on the synthesis, complexation and characterization of the U-PEI-C is currently being prepared. * N N * N H 2 O 3 P PO 3 H 2 H 2 O 3 P 194 * N N * N O O O 194 OH HO HO</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 : drawing of the two polymers PEI-C and PEI-P Fig. 2 : Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectrum of the sample PEI-C-U, at physiological pH.
