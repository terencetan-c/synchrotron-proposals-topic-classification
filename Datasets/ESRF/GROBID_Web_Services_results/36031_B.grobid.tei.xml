<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>As outlined in the proposal, the purpose of the experiments at ID32 was to measure bonding distances and conformation of pentacene (PEN; Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and perfuoropentacene (PFP: Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) on noble metal surfaces. In combination with other complementary techniques the Xray standing wave (XSW) measurements will establish a fundamental understanding of the two prototypical organic semiconductors in the monolayer regime <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>We intended to use Au(111) and Cu(111) single crystals, but unfortunately the quality of our Au(111) crystal did not permit meaningful XSW measurements. The Cu(111) substrate, however, turned out to be of high quality, with the a normal incidence rocking width of ~0.90 eV (close to the intrinsic value), and could successfully be used for XSW measurements.</p><p>Below we give a short summary of results from the beam time (SI1526) at ID32.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">XPS and XSW measurements on monolayers of PEN and PFP</head><p>Several films of PEN and PFP with different coverages in the submonolayer and monolayer regime were prepared at a substrate temperature of T=80 °C. We used both C(1s) carbon signals shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and the F(1s) fluorine signal for our XSW experiments.</p><p>Due to the improved stability of the new monochromator we were able to acquire hi gh quality XSW data. The characteristic variation of the photo electron yield in the Xray interference field provides the coherent positions P eff and coherent fractions f eff for the atoms in the PEN and PFP molecules on Cu(111), see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Tab. 1. In the data analysis we followed the procedures established in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. After converting these data into distances and applying nondipole corrections we find an (average) CCu bonding length of (2.34 ± 0.02) Å for PEN and (2.98 ± 0.07) Å for PFP, i.e., a difference of 0.64 Å between the carbon cores of these two adsorbate systems on Cu(111). As we find that the fluorine atoms of PFP reside at a distance of (3.08 ± 0.04) Å, the XSW results suggest that the PFP molecule does not adsorb in a planar configuration on Cu(111). SI1526 2 Illustration 2: Carbon XPS signals from a submonolayer of <ref type="bibr">PEN and PFP on Cu(111)</ref>. Note the splitting of the C(1s) for PFP which corresponds to the different chemical environments of the carbon atoms <ref type="bibr">(CC versus CF bonded)</ref>.</p><p>Illustration 3: Xray standing wave scans obtained on submonolayers of <ref type="bibr">PEN and PFP on Cu(111)</ref>. The symbols represent the photo electron yield (circles) and reflectivity (triangles) data measured on both adsorbate systems. The solid lines show least square fits based on dynamical diffraction theory which provide the coherent position P eff and coherent fraction f eff for each element. The characteristic shapes of these curves reveal the different adsorption distances d of PEN and PFP, whereas the deviation of the coherent fractions from unity is related to disorder in the adsorbate system.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We were able to measure all relevant data for PEN and PFP on Cu(111), see Tab. 1. The surprisingly big difference between the bonding distance of PEN and PFP have been found. These results in good agreement with complementary measurements using photoemission and scanning tunneling microscopy data. A manuscript with all results has been submitted <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. We wish to thank our local contact for the excellent support on ID32.</p></div>
