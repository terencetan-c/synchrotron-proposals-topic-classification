<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The need for clean and abundant fuels will be one of the greatest challenges to mankind in the near future, as the peak oil discussion has settled, stating that the peak of oil production will be reached within the next 10-20 years. Fuel cells are one of the most promising alternatives, since their working principle is mostly understood and recent activities focus on increasing their efficiency. However, the production of "fuels" for fuels cells, i.e. hydrogen H 2 and oxygen O 2 in the simplest case, remains one bottleneck that prevents fuel cells to be already considered a serious alternative to fossil fuels. Solar light driven water splitting reactions are a very promising approach to overcome this limitation, since "The ultimate solution to satisfy the world's energy demand is the cleavage of water into its atomic building blocks, hydrogen and oxygen". <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Empiric studies identified iron-carbonyls as catalysts of rather high activity for light-driven water reduction (i.e. H 2 production), as revealed by increasing numbers of high-impact publications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Although the results are very promising, the activity of the catalysts does not yet allow a real industrial application. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> It is known that phosphine based ligands ("PR" in the following) increase the catalytic activity, but the mechanism induced by these phosphine ligands remains unclear. Therefore directed improvements are hindered by the lack of knowledge about the mechanistic details in the iron cycle. A proposed general mechanism is given in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> with Fe(CO) 5 as pre-catalyst. Despite EPR and IR/Raman studies, which gave first hints, no direct image of the species formed in course of the reaction is accessible yet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The aggregation degree of the iron core of the formed cluster in dependence of the used precatalyst is still a matter of debate and the number of remaining CO ligands and coordinating phosphine molecules are unknown. We therefore carried out XAS measurement to study the iron cycle of light-driven water reduction in-situ/in operando (part of the measurements were carried out at ANKA, Karlsruhe as well). Although the data analysis is still in progress, preliminary results can be presented here. The studied catalyst was Fe 3 (CO) 12 in the reaction solution consisting of a 4/1/1 mixture THF/triethylamin/H 2 O. The phosphine ligand used was P(PhCF 3 ) 3 , it was used in different stoichiometric ratios together with an Iridium photoactive system. The results from fitting the EXAFS results are given in the following table.</p><p>Sample Abs-Bs N(Bs) R(Abs-Bs) 0.01 M Fe 3 (CO) 12 in solution (1) Fe-C Fe-Fe Fe-O/CO MS 4.7 ± 0.5 2.0 ± 0.2 12.0 ± 1.2 1.80 ± 0.02 2.51 ± 0.03 2.99 ± 0.03 0.01 M Fe 3 (CO) 12 in solution + Ir-PS after 5 h irradiation (2) Fe-C Fe-Fe Fe-O/CO MS 4.4 ± 0.4 1.7 ± 0.2 11.6 ± 1.2 1.79 ± 0.02 2.57 ± 0.03 2.97 ± 0.03 0.025 M Fe 3 (CO) 12 in solution + 1 eq. P(PhCF 3 ) 3 (3) Fe-C Fe-P Fe-Fe Fe-O/CO MS 4.8 ± 0.5 0.3 ± 0.1 0.1 ± 0.1 14.0 ± 1.4 1.76 ± 0.02 2.18 ± 0.02 2.47 ± 0.03 2.98 ± 0.03 0.025 M Fe 3 (CO) 12 in solution + 1 eq. P(PhCF 3 ) 3 + Ir-PS after 9 h irradiation (4) Fe-C Fe-P Fe-Fe Fe-O/CO MS 3.5 ± 0.4 0.8 ± 0.1 1.6 ± 0.2 9.1 ± 1.2 1.79 ± 0.02 2.13 ± 0.02 2.42 ± 0.03 2.94 ± 0.03 0.025 M Fe 3 (CO) 12 in solution + 3 eq. P(PhCF 3 ) 3 (5) Fe-C Fe-P Fe-Fe Fe-O/CO MS 5.3 ± 0.5 1.2 ± 0.1 1.5 ± 0.2 14 ± 1.4 1.75 ± 0.02 2.17 ± 0.02 2.34 ± 0.03 2.99 ± 0.03</p><p>It can be seen, that the structure of Fe 3 (CO) 12 is preserve in solution, while under irradiation, a CO ligand is abstracted, as can be seen from the reduced Fe-C coordination number. When the phosphine ligand is added, its coordination can be detected by XAS. However, the trimeric nature of the iron species is destroyed, and only monomers are left. This changes again under reaction conditions, when the Ir photosystem is added and light is switched on. In this case, a significant Fe-Fe contribution appears again, which has to be understood </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): *Matthias Bauer, FB Chemie, TU Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schrödinger-Str. 54, 67663 Kaiserslautern *Roland Schoch, FB Chemie, TU Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schrödinger-Str. 54, 67663 Kaiserslautern</figDesc></figure>
