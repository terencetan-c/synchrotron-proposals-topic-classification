<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The beamtime allocated to proposal MX 1909 was used to perform solution SAXS measurements on threedimensional heteromultimeric DNA origami objects. The studied objects comprised DNA origami rectangles that have shape complementary double-helical protrusions and recessions that can precisely dock into each other and form a 3D cube in the presence of 50 mM MgCl 2 . The cubes can further assemble to create a 3D DNA origami lattice. For each SAXS measurement we carried out 10 runs in 'flow' mode using the automated sample roboter installed at BM29. Sample profiles were analyzed for radiation damage and matching profiles were averaged. Appropriate buffer profiles were averaged and subtracted from the sample profiles. We performed SAXS measurements on the DNA origami rectangle, cube and lattice objects at concentrations in the range of 50 nM and 100 nM. The obtained scattering data were of high quality with a dynamic range covering ~ 4 orders of magnitude in intensity and with features identifiable up to q-values ≈ 1 nm -1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Comparison of scattering profiles from the DNA origami rectangle, cube and lattice revealed clearly identifiable structural differences. In contrast to the DNA origami rectangle, the cube and lattice structures display several intensity peaks resulting from the highly symmetric structural arrangement.</p><p>This effect is even more pronounced in the DNA origami lattice structure. From the scattering data of the DNA origami lattice we could calculate the structure factor and fit the data with a rectangular lattice model.</p><p>Based on the fit we could determine a lattice constant in the order of ~ 50 nm, which is in good agreement with values obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of DNA origami cube objects.</p><p>In addition, we calculated theoretical scattering profiles based on atomistic models of the DNA origami structures generated from the software CanDo and compared and them to the experimental data. Although we observed slight shifts of the theoretical scattering curves with respect to the experimental data, the theoretical curves reproduce the observable intensity peaks. We are currently working on a manuscript to publish our data. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Dr. Jan Lipfert, LMU Munich, Chair of Biophysics and Applied Materials Dr. Linda Brützel*, LMU Munich, Chair of Biophysics and Applied Materials M.Sc.
