<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Glassy mixture of chalcogenides and Ag halides behaves as a superionic conductor even at room temperature. Thus it has received much attention due to the fundamental interest on the conduction mechanism as well as the application to solid-state electrochemical devices. In case of (As 2 Se 3 ) 1-x (AgI) x mixtures, glassy phases can be obtained over a wide concentration range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6. Usuki and coworkers [1] have investigated electrical, thermodynamic, and structural properties of glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 1-x (AgI) x mixtures, such as electrical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, density, Raman scattering, XAFS, diffraction using both X-rays and neutrons. All of these experimental results do not contradict a model of a pseudo-binary mixture of the As 2 Se 3 network matrix and AgI-related ionic conduction pathways. This structural model has, however, not been confirmed by any partial structural experiments covering the intermediate-range order (IRO), such as neutron scattering using isotope substituted sample or anomalous X-ray scattering (AXS). Thus, the conduction mechanism of this room-temperature superionic glass is still open to question. In this project, we have carried out an AXS experiment on glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgI) 0.6 mixture close to the As, Se, and Ag K edges. The glassy sample was obtained by simple iced-water quenching the sample in a fused silica ampoule after heating and rocking the melt for at least 48 hours. A pellet with a flat surface was made for the AXS experiment with a pressing tool. The concentration and the homogeneity of the sample were examined by measuring conventional X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis at several positions of the quenched sample. The AXS experiment was carried out at two energies below the K edges of As and Se (-20 and -200 eV), or Ag (-30 and -200 eV) at BM02/ESRF. For the diffraction experiment, we used a graphite crystal energy analyser together with a scintillation counter on a long (45 cm) detector arm, which we developed for the AXS experiment. The differential structure factors ∆ i S(Q) can be obtained by taking the difference of two scattering spectra, and the i-th element related partial structure factors S ij (Q) dominate the ∆ i S(Q). Figure shows the ∆ i S(Q) spectra close to the As (crosses), Se (circles), and Ag (triangles) K edges. For the comparison, the total structure factor S(Q) is also given by the solid curve. Clear contrasts are observed among the ∆ i S(Q) and S(Q) spectra. Differences from the other spectra are prominent in ∆ Ag S(Q): the oscillations are almost out phase of the others. Another difference is observed in the pre-shoulder in S(Q) near Q = 12 nm -1 , which is the clear evidence of the IRO in this glass. The ∆ As S(Q) spectrum has a large prepeak at about 12 nm -1 , where the small pre-shoulder locates in S(Q). The ∆ Se S(Q) spectrum also shows a small peak at the same Q position. However, ∆ Ag S(Q) shows almost no indication of the prepeak or pre-shoulder. It should be noted that both the ∆ As S(Q) and ∆ Se S(Q) results surprisingly look very similar to those of glassy As 2 Se 3 [2], although their S(Q) spectra are very different from each other. Thus the local structure around the As and Se atoms is very similar to that in glassy As 2 Se 3 . Although there has not been no experiment that obtained partial information on the structure of molten <ref type="bibr">AgI,</ref><ref type="bibr">Shimojo et al. [3]</ref> have recently carried out a first principles molecular dynamic simulation of this salt which reproduce well the S(Q) spectrum. The ∆ Ag S(Q) spectrum obtained from this simulation surprisingly coincides well with that of glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgI) 0.6 mixture. Thus, it is concluded that the local environment around the Ag atoms in (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgI) 0.6 superionic glass is absolutely molten AgI-like. Therefore, the pseudo-binary mixture of the As 2 Se 3 network matrix and AgIrelated ionic conduction pathway is a good structural model for this room-temperature superionic glass. The present results were obtained during two beamtimes (HS2798 and HD63).</p><p>[1] T. <ref type="bibr">Usuki et al., J. Non-Cryst.
