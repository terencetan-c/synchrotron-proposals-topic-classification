<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to bring insight into the mechanisms that rule the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP) to humans, we undertook this Ag K-edge XAS study. Our strategy consisted in the investigation of: 1) The complexes that Ag + forms with biological ligands in solution, especially in relation to its competition with Cu + binding.</p><p>2) The release of Ag + from Ag-NP in exposed cells and its recombination in cellulo.</p><p>Experimental details: Samples were prepared in a glove box in our home laboratory and measured at ~16 K in the He-cryostat of FAME-BM30B. Ag concentration in the solutions was low (down to 1 mM, i.e. ~100 ppm), however, thanks to the high photon flux provided in the 200 mA current mode and to the sensitivity of the 30-elements Ge detector, high quality EXAFS spectra could be acquired in fluorescence mode. All spectra were acquired in the 25.20-26.25 keV energy range (up to k=14 Å -1 ), the total integration time for each sample was chosen in order to provide 10 6 fluorescence counts above the absorption edge. A 3µm Ru filter was used to reduce the elastic scattering reaching the detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Ag + complexation with biological ligands was first studied by incubating the metal with biomimetic compounds synthesised in our home institute: P3, a peptide providing two metalbinding Cys side chains, and L1, a tripode presenting three converging metal-binding Cys. These ligands were designed by mimicking the Cu-binding motifs of proteins involved in Cu homeostasis, such as metallothioneins (MT) and metallochaperones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>; they were proven to efficiently bind also Ag + , as expected considering the similar electronic configurations of Cu + and Ag + . Their affinity for Ag + binding might therefore suggest a mechanism of Ag-NP toxicity based on the disruption of Cu homeostasis. Our UV/VIS and circular dichroism experiments proved that the two chelators form compounds with Ag + up to stoichiometries of [Ag]:[P3]=1.5:1 and [Ag]:[L1]=2:1. The EXAFS data were collected on four samples characterized by different Ag + /ligand ratios: Ag + /P3=1, 1.5 and Ag + /L1=1, 2. Ag + concentration in sub-stoichiometric samples was below the detection limit. The data reveal that, for Ag + /ligand=1, the Ag + binding sites in the AgP3 and AgL1 complexes present only S ligands, in number of 2.2±0.2 and 3.0±0.3 respectively. The AgS 2 site in AgP3 is compatible with a digonal planar geometry with an Ag-S average distance of 2.477 (7) Å; the presence of an Ag atom at 2.99 (3) Å from the absorber was revealed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (A)</ref> and <ref type="figure">(B)</ref>). The complex Ag-glutathion (GSH) showed a similar XAS spectrum and the same ligation pattern, confirming the pertinence of P3 as a model for the complexation of Ag with biomolecules. We are currently comparing our 1 st shell results with a survey of Ag + -thiolate complexes encountered in the CSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, in order to identify the putative models to fit the full EXAFS spectrum. The AgS 3 site in the Ag/L1=1 sample presents a trigonal planar geometry, with an average Ag-S distance of 2.489 (7) Å and no Ag-Ag interaction in the radius probed by EXAFS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (A</ref>) and (B)); this is compatible with the formation of a S-bridged network of AgS 3 sites. Unexpectedly, in the Ag/L1=2 sample the Ag coordination sphere is unchanged and no Ag-Ag interaction is detected, contrary to what we found in CuL1 complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Two Ag-MT complexes were as well studied by Ag K-edge XAS, revealing a number of S ligands of 2.5±0.2; this value suggests that the MT metal-binding site is populated with a cluster where Ag + shows both digonal AgS 2 and trigonal AgS 3 coordination.</p><p>The release of Ag + from Ag-NP and its complexation in cellulo was investigated in two cellular models: primary murine macrophages and HepG2 hepatocytes cell line. Cells were exposed to sublethal doses of Ag-NP for 6-to 24-hours, washed and then frozen in liquid N 2 and analyzed by Ag K-edge XAS at 16 K. In both cell lines, the features of the XANES spectra are progressively smoothed with increasing the exposure time to NP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (A)-macrophages and (B)-hepatocytes); the XANES and EXAFS spectra were fitted as linear combinations of model compounds, in order to discriminate the fraction of intracellular dissolved and recombined Ag + ions. As reference compounds we used the Agthiols complexes described in the previous section, as well as AgCl and AgNO 3 (prepared in pellet from commercial powders). Our data suggest the preferential recombination of Ag with SH groups in cellulo. A more advanced analysis of the EXAFS region of the spectra is currently in progress, aimed at discriminating the average coordination geometry of Ag + in the AgS x complexes formed. Interestingly, the same effect was encountered in the two cellular models, with a slightly faster kinetics in macrophages than in hepatocytes; the effect of the NP coating was also investigated (only in hepatocytes): Ag + release and recombination were more prominent in citrate-than in PVP-coated Ag-NP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives:</head><p>The allocated beamtime was fully exploited, and the experiment provided satisfactory results that will be the subject of two publications (one in preparation). The experimental protocol was validated, and the results open the possibility to new investigations, like: 1) Interaction between Ag-NP and biological ligands (biomimetic compounds and other Cu homeostasis proteins like the chaperon Atox1).</p><p>2) Ag + release and recombination in cells (macrophages and hepatocytes) upon chronic exposure to Ag-NP.</p><p>3) Dissolution and recombination kinetics in cellulo (several exposure conditions between 6-and 24-hours) and influence of the NP coating on the kinetics.
