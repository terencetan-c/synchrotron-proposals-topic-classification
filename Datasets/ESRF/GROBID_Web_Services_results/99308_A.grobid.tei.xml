<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of beamtime MA-5226 (including the following in-house time) was to investigate water management and salt precipitation in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers for CO2/CO electrolysis. For CO2 electrolysis (CO2E), we focused specifically on understanding how different alkali cations (Li, Na, K, and Cs) and their concentration could affect the occurrence of salt precipitation in the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and thus affect the CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR) selectivity. As for the CO electrolysis (COE), we investigated how water management changes in cathode GDEs with different PTFE contents. The results obtained from this work: (1) for CO2E, will be used to identify cations that can replace the existing alkali cations but without having to sacrifice the CO2RR selectivity and to develop membranes that are selective enough to prevent excessive cation crossover to the cathode; (2) for COE, will be used to identify the suitable GDE substrate for loading cathode catalyst as well as developing stable anode catalyst in alkaline conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup used:</head><p>We used an MEA-based cell which has earlier shown successful results during our last visit to ESRF in June 2021 (MA-4791). To explore the water and salt precipitation distribution in the GDE, we used wide-angle Xray scattering for all our experiments. The product measurement was done using an inline mass spectrometer (MS) and gas chromatograph (GC).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cation effect on salt precipitation in the GDE during CO2E:</head><p>First, we investigated the salt formation with different alkali cations in the GDE during CO2E. As expectedly, we found that lithium, sodium, and potassium cations allow salt formation in the GDE while no signs of salt formation were observed with the cesium cations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This is attributed to the high solubility of cesium salts as compared to other alkali cation salts. Surprisingly, with the lithium cations, we found that the lithium cations formed a salt layer right at the top of the catalyst layer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), while in the case of sodium cations, the salts seem to move from the interior to the exterior of the GDE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). With the potassium cations, the salt layer remains relatively stable at the interface of the micro and the macroporous layer of the GDE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modulating potassium concentration affects salt precipitation during CO2E:</head><p>Secondly, we investigated how salt precipitation in the GDE changes by modulating K + concentration in the anolyte. In principle, we should see less precipitation with reducing K + concentration given that diffusion should decrease. As expectedly, we observe a delay in the formation of salt precipitation with reduced concentration (0.001M) and significantly stable CO2R selectivity (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Water management over different Cu GDE substrates in COE:</head><p>With CO electrolysis, we were expecting a vastly different water flux due to the transfer of hydroxyl groups being the dominant anion species crossing over the membrane rather than carbonates in CO2E. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the increase in electrolyte intensity (which could also be termed flooding) in the GDE correlates well with an increase in HER in both 28BC and 39BC GDEs. However, in 39BC, the maximum intensity of electrolyte flooding was slightly lower than in 28BC, and that could very well explain why 39BC has slightly better CORR selectivity than 28BC. The reason for increased electrolyte flooding in 28BC could be its lower thickness than 39BC (235 vs 325 Âµm). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Our CO2E experiment with different alkali cations clearly shows that using a more soluble salt (e.g. cesium bicarbonates) could help prevent the salt formation in the cathode GDEs. Also, reducing the cation concentration in the anolyte could delay the salt precipitation phenomenon. Moreover, the COE experiment shows an increase in electrolyte content in the cathode GDE which correlates well with an increase in HER. In principle, the results obtained from the beamtime are excellent and we aim to publish at least two high-impact publications and hope to put a new proposal to continue investigating existing hurdles in the CO2/CO electrolysis field. The knowledge and techniques used by our group could also be helpful for other researchers working with different electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, water splitting, N2 reduction, etc.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
