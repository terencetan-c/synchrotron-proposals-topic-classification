<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The relative abundance of the Rare Earth Elements (REE) are often used in the earth sciences to proide insight into geological processes. Relative to the smoothly varying (normalised) concentrations of the other REE, anomalous abundances of Ce (enriched) or Eu (depleted) are a feature of many minerals and rocks. These anomalies are almost certainly related to the fact that Eu and Ce exhibit oxidation state variability (Eu 2+ /Eu 3+ and Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ), unlike the other REE. To interpret the significance of these anomalies it is necessary to understand how Eu 2+ /ΣEu and Ce 3+ /ΣCe vary in silicate melts as a function of the redox conditions (or oxygen fugacity, fO 2 ). The calibration of the magnitude of Eu and Ce anomalies with fO 2 would provide a new geochemcial tool.</p><p>The samples were homogeneous Ca-Mg-Al-Si±Fe oxide glasses containing 0.5 wt% of Eu or Ce that are synthetic analogues of natural melts. The glasses were quenched from melts equilibrated at different values of fO 2 to produce samples in which Eu 2+ /ΣEu and Ce 3+ /ΣCe are expected to systematically vary. The glasses are typically 5 mm in size and were presented as polished surfaces in epoxy resin.</p><p>Eu and Ce L 3 edge XANES spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode at room temperature. The relative signal to noise of spectra recorded using a single element Si-drift and a ten-element Ge detector were compared and the Ge detector was found to be better for these samples. Approimately 90 Eu and 75 Ce spectra were obtained. The spectra were compared after subtracting a constant offset and normalising to the fluorescence intensity above the edge. For both the Eu and Ce samples the spectra exhibit systematic differences with the fO 2 of equilibration corresponding to changes in the average oxidation state (see Figure ). The spectra were parameterised using features such as the intensity of the Eu 2+ peak (6.97 keV), the intensity of the Eu 3+ peak (6.98 keV), the peak ratio, and the edge energy. The oxidation state and hence a spectral feature should vary with fO 2 according to a thermodynamically predicted function. The fit of our parameterised spectral data to this function is good but not entirely convincing and we are currently correlating the XANES data with results obtained using other methods. In related work we have experimentally grown the mineral zircon (ZrSiO 4 ) from melts similar to those used in the XANES experiments as a function of fO 2 . Zircon incorporates trace amounts of all the trivalent REE but preferentially includes Ce 4+ and excludes Eu 2+ . The relative abundance of the REE in zircon and melt will hence depend on the oxidation state and fO 2 . In November 2010 we determined these abundances using an ion probe and will obtain more data using laser ablation ICPMS in March 2011. The results show systematic changes in the magnitude of the Eu and Ce anomalies with fO 2 . We are currently integrating the XANES and ion probe results in an attempt to properly understand the geochemical behaviour of Eu and Ce. This work forms part of the PhD project of Antony Burnham who is due to submit his thesis in March 2012. Publications arising from this beamtime are to be expected around this time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure :</head><label>:</label><figDesc>Figure: Eu L 3 edge XANES spectra of synthetic glasses equilibrated as a function of oxygen fugacity (decreasing from bottom to top) showing systematic changes in the oxidation state.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,136.56,-145.78,527.34,747.66" type="bitmap" /></figure>
