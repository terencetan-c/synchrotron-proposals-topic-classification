The experiments could be carried out very successfully, and the data analysis still in progress.

The intensity distribution along several symmetry independent crystal truncation rods (CTRs) was collected for the pristine surface first. In the next step, EuS was deposited in the ultra-thin film thickness range using a Knudsen cell loaded with EuS powder This takes about 2 hours at a temperature of 840°C. According to our in-house experiments (see STM image below) this leads to a film thickness of about 1 unit cell along the (111) direction of cubic EuS (a0=5.97 Å) which is equal to 10.34 Å. Fig. 1 shows for comparison the (01L) CTR collected for the clean and EuS covered Bi2Se3 (0001) surface, respectively. It can be seen that there is a substantial modification of the CTRs related to adsorption of EuS. LEED investigations (see Fig.2) has shown that there is only a (1x1) pattern present and no superstructure forms. Until now, no completely satisfying fit of the CTR instensities is available which would allow a clear-cut statement of the film and interface structure. Preliminary analysis suggests however, that there is substantial atomic intermixing across the EuS/Bi2Se3 interface. This observation might be important to understand the recently observed unusual magnetic properties [3]. The data anaylsis is still in progress. References: [1] Sumalay Roy, H. L. Meyerheim, A.
