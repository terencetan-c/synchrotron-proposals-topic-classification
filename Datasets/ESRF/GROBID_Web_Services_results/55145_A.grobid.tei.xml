<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Magnetic cooling based on the magnetocaloric effect could replace conventional vapor compression cooling, as it has a potentially lower energy consumption and does not rely on environmental hazardous gases [K. <ref type="bibr">A. Gscheidner Jr., et al., Int. J. Refrig. 31, 945-961 (2008)</ref>]. The intermetallic compounds in the system Mn x Fe 5-</p><p>x Si 3 (1≤x≤4) undergo a variety of magnetic phase transitions at different temperatures depending on their iron content which is distributed on at least one mixed Mn/Fe site and one pure iron site <ref type="bibr">[H. Binczyska, at al., Phys. Stat. Sol., Sect. A, 19, 13-17 (1973)</ref>] and contain only cheap non-toxic elements in comparison with other possible candidates [K. <ref type="bibr">A. Gscheidner Jr., et al., Int. J. Refrig. 31, 945-961 (2008)</ref>].</p><p>This system is an ideal choice to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of the MCE in multiple site driven magnetocaloric materials. To study the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the crystal lattice and structure we measured powder diffraction diagrams of two compounds of the system Mn x Fe 5-x Si 3 (x=1 and x=4) on beamline ID09A at the ESRF (λ=0.414038 Å). This facility is equipped with diamond anvil cells that can be introduced in a He-cryostat so that it is possible to measure at non-ambient conditions of pressure and temperature simultaneously.</p><p>For the x=1 compound Powder was mounted in a membrane driven diamond anvil cell modified for Boehler-Almax anvils and helium was used as a pressure medium to ensure quasi-hydrostatic conditions. A total of 52 powder pattern were taken upon compression (0.10GPa to 10.91GPa) at ambient temperature and 11 under decompression. Additional 42 datasets were taken upon compression (0.11GPa to 7.68GPa) at 373 K. Ruby luminescence method was used for pressure calibration <ref type="bibr">[Mao, H. K., et al., J. Geophys. Res., 91, 4673 (1986)</ref>].</p><p>For the x=4 compound Powder was mounted in an other membrane driven diamond anvil cell modified for Boehler-Almax anvils and helium was used as a pressure medium to ensure quasi-hydrostatic conditions. A total of 220 powder pattern were taken upon compression (0.63GPa to 10.95GPa) at 100K, 150K 200K and 250K using the instruments cryostat. Additional 24 datasets were taken upon compression (0.24GPa to 12.49GPa) at AT and a combined number 100 datasets were taken upon compression (0.12GPa to 6.16GPa) at 325K, 350K and 375K using the instruments high temperature option. Ruby luminescence method was used for pressure calibration <ref type="bibr">[Mao, H. K., et al., J. Geophys. Res., 91, 4673 (1986)</ref>].</p><p>Fit2D [A P Hammersley, ESRF Internal Report, ESRF97HA02T, ``FIT2D: An Introduction and Overview <ref type="bibr">'', (1997)</ref>] was used to carefully mask all strong diamond reflecions and integrate the data from the Mar555 detector.</p><p>To follow the temperature and pressure dependence of the lattice parameters refinements in the Le Bail method were started [A. <ref type="bibr">Lebail, et. al., Mater. Res. Bull. 23, 447-452 (1988)</ref>]. Started from the dataset measured at the lowest pressure of each temperature. All refinements were performed with the program Jana2006 [V. <ref type="bibr">Petricek, et. al.</ref>, Jana2006, Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, <ref type="bibr">Praha (2006)</ref>]. Two profile parameters (GW and LY) and the zero shift were taken into account in the refinement. The background was manually defined.</p><p>Complementary neutron (x=4 at SPODI MLZ) and in house x-ray (x=1,2,3) powder diffraction experiments as a function of temperature were taken to ilucidate the difference between the effect of temperature to the effect of hydrostatic pressure measured at ID09A. For direct comparisson a/c ratios were plotted over the unit cell volume (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The temperature dependant curves show a relatively small change in volume but a strong effect on the a/c ratio while hydrostatic pressure strongly affects the unit cell volume. This clearly show that the influence of temperature is significantly stronger than the influence of hydrostatic pressure in this caloric material.</p><p>The analysis of the temperature and pressure dependend data is currently being performed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Comparison of temperature dependant and pressure dependant cell volume and a/c ratio of four compounds of the series Mn 5-x Fe x Si 3 .</figDesc><graphic coords="3,47.40,423.22,250.00,184.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>
