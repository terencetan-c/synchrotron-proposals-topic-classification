The experiment was difficult but we succeed to perform it. In the experiment, the incidence angle (i.e. k) of the beam on the sample was changed while the sample was rotating within the ab-plane (azimuthal angle). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>This angle resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (ARXAS), in which the polarization and k of the photons were simultaneously changed, allowed us to establish directly the fact that the transition in the normal incidence geometry is not allowed due to k-selection rule. It should be mentioned that it is the first time we have experimentally demonstrated the k-dependence of the quadrupole transition. The results are being analysed.Due to non-trivial experimental conditions it was hard to complete the proposed work in the HE-518. However the compelling result need to be properly followed with further experiment, such as how the qudrupole transition amplitude changes from one sample to the other with different hole doping in high Tc compound and how the superconducting transition affects this amplitude. This further work is expected to establish some correlation between the qudrupole transition and the local lattice distortions. At the same time the dependence on the temperature is expected to help us in quntifying the phonon contribution to the pre-peak intensity. To complete the work we propose the experiment HE-518 to be continued.</figDesc></figure>

In plane polarized Cu K-edge XANES spectra weveused to study the Is-&gt; 3dx2-y2 quadrupole transition. For these studies, Bi2Sr2CaCu208 superconducting single crystals were model compounds.</p><p>The results show that the pre-peak intensity in the Cu K-edge spectra is very small (but non-negligible) when the polarization of the electric vector (E)of the synchrotron beam is parallel to the Cu-0-Cu bonds while it has maximum intensity when E is parallel to the orthorhombic a and b-axis, i.e., 450 from the Cu-0-Cu bonds.
