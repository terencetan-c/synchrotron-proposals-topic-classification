<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The X-ray absorption spectrum of a large variety of different samples (50 in total) has been successfully recorded within the 9 avialable shifts of 8 hours. The energy of the beam was varied to investigate the coordination of 6 chemical elements: In (main focus of the project), Sn, Pd, Eu, Co and Fe. The measurements went smoothly and high-quality spectra were obtained for all samples at all energies, although this was slightly more challenging for the light elements compared to the heavy elements. We are highly satisfied with the performance of the beamline and the support of the beamline scientist, including for the support in changing the gases in the ion chambers of the detectors and optimising/calibrating the beamline when switching to other energies and for advice in sample preparation.</p><p>The next coming months, we will focus on the processing of the spectra. Since a large variety of elements and samples were measured on different research topics, the data processing needs to be tailored to each sample separately. Finally, all results will be published in a number of different publications within the coming year.</p><p>The first part of In samples targeted the speciation of In in dry Cyphos IL 101, after dissolving InCl3 in three molar fraction: 0.25, 0.33 and 0.5. According to the literature on the speciation of indium in another type of ionic liquid, namely [C8mim][Cl], the speciation of indium varied with composition of the samples. It was verified whether it is also applicable to Cyphos IL 101. The (highly hygroscopic) samples were prepared in the home institute under dry conditions and had to be quickly transferred and measured to prevent uptake of water. After a visual check of the absorption spectra and extracted EXAFS at the beamline, the samples were concluded to be stable over the time of the data recording.</p><p>A postiori analysis of the EXAFS spectra of InCl3 dissolved in Cyphos IL 101 clearly showed the presence of the same species in all three mixtures containing a molar fraction of InCl3 of 0.50, 0.33 and 0.25 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The data were fitted with a model containing only one In-Cl single scattering path and revealed the presence of four chloride ligands in all three samples. It was thus concluded that the assumption of the formation of different In species depending on the amount of chloride ligands present in the sample, by changing the molar ratio InCl3 versus Cyphos IL 101, was not valid. The goal of the next set of In samples was to gain more in-depth understanding of the extraction mechanism of indium in (non-)aqueous solvent extraction to the quaternary phosphonium chloride extractant Cyphos IL 101. Speciation is studied as a function of the In concentration in both the aqueous/more polar phase and organic/less polar phase. These samples were all measured in plastic cuvettes, which allowed a nice homogeneous sample preparation and nice results. It should be marked that since the samples contained toluene, they needed to be measured immediately after preparation and discarded immediately after the measurement, since the plastic cuvette dissolves in toluene. Nevertheless, the results show that the samples remained stable during the measurement (each time, two scans were recorded).</p><p>A third part of the experiment was dealing with the dissolution and coordination chemistry of InCl3 and In(Tf2N)3 in several solvents, including 1,2-dimethoxyethane and polyethylene glycol. It has been observed that InCl3 is hardly soluble in these solvents, but upon the addition of In(Tf2N)3 it suddenly starts to dissolve. EXAFS will help us explain this phenomenon. These samples were easily measured in plastic cuvettes, allowing to obtained textbook absorption spectra. Each time, two scans were recored to allow statistical analysis.</p><p>Besides the samples in In, we also measured samples with Sn, Pd, Eu, Co and Fe. The purpose of these samples was: Sn: determine number of coordinating bromides after oxidative dissolution in a tribromide ionic liquid; Pd: type and number of ligands after extracting Pd to a iodide anion-exchange extractant; Eu: complex structure of Eu(II) in nitrate solution; Co and Fe: determination of the structure of the complex (number of ligands) after dissolution in ethylammonium nitrate and after non-aqueous solvent extraction to TBP. After processing, the results of these samples will be added to four different manuscripts, currently already under construction, as a extended proof to support the scientific hypothesis of each of these works.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: EXAFS spectra of InCl3 dissolved in dry Cyphos IL 101 at varying molar fractions x = 0.50, 0.33 and 0.25.
