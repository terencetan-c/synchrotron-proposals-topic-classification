<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The primary goal of the proposed experiment is to quantitatively investigate the sol-gel transition kinetics of sodium alginate caused by the diffusion to the interface of calcium chloride nanoparticles suspended in oil and surfactant by means of GI-XPCS.</p><p>The change in the interface dynamics was followed by monitoring the time evolution of the autocorrelation function (ACF): g 2 (q,t) ~ exp[-2(t/τq) b ] of silanized SiO2 nanoparticles (Ø ~ 100 nm) confined at the oil water interface. Thanks to the knowledge and experience acquired during the previous beam time <ref type="bibr">(SC 4654, February 2018)</ref>, in this instance we were able to overcome the challenges dictated by the complexity of our system, which led us to obtain promising data to better understand the 2D gelation dynamics of polyalginate at the oil/water interface. We focused on the gelation of 1.5 wt% polyalginate by the addition of cross-linkers (CaCl2 nanoparticles) suspended in vegetable oil. We monitored how the dynamics at a microscale changed and eventually slowed down by aquiring data at different time points. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>   Furthermore, the dependency of the relaxation time on q|| and q^ was investigated. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows how the ACF decay time depends strongly depends on q|| whereas it is almost negligeable on the account of q^. These findings suggest that the dynamics of nanometric domains at the oil/water interface slows down as the sol-gel transition proceeds. Further experiment and data analysis are needed to shed light on the impact of polymer and cross-linker concentration on the reaction dynamics at the oil/water interface.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>shows a selection of normalized autocorrelation function at different time points and at constant q||. Interestingly, as the gelation proceeds, the characteristic decay time of the autocorrelation functions increases (Fig.2b), which is accompanied by the increase of the form factor b (Fig 3c)which is reflected in a more prominent shoulder-like profile in the autocorrelation function. Last but not least, the relaxation time G plotted vs q|| suggests the suppression of interface dyamics by gelation.</figDesc></figure>
