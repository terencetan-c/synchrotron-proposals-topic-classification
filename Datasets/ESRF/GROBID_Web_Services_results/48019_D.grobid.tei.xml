<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Premise</head><p>The beamtime was divided approximately in two equivalent parts, dedicated at measurements at the Sn and Cu K edge respectively. At both edges, two kind of samples were investigated (together with the relevant standards): nanopowders of ternary and quaternary kesterite-like materials, and solar cells containing thin films of binary ternary and quaternary sulfides, still belonging to the same kesterite-stannite-kuramite system. Owing to the fact that the investigated samples are largely different, implying different experimental approaches, the correpsonding results are exposed separately in the following paragraphs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">-nanopowders 1.-Experimental procedures</head><p>All measurements were carried out at the Beamline BM08 at the ESRF. The list of the investigated samples is reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Samples st1495 and st1499/51 are natural specimens belonging to the Natural History Museum of Florence, and represent the most studied stannite reference materials (something like "international standards"). Stsyn is a synthetic sample obtained by a conventional synthetic route. St1495, st1499/51 and stsyn are indistinguishable by XRD, i.e. they are supposed to have exactly the same structure. NkurM and nst2 are two synthetic samples obtained through a novel solvothermal route. From XRD inspection, they seem to have the same structural model as that of standards, but with random cation distribution.</p><p>Table 1 sample Chemical formula Structural reference Sn K edge spectrum Cu K edge spectrum Type St1495 Cu 1.97 Fe 0.92 Zn 0.07 Sn 1.01 S 4.03 Bonazzi Transmission Transmission Std St1499/51 Cu 2.04 Fe 0.78 Zn 0.24 Sn 1.01 S 3.94 Bonazzi Transmission Transmission Std Stsyn Cu 2 FeSnS 4 Bonazzi Transmission Transmission Std nkurM Cu 3 SnS 4 unknown Transmission Transmission Unk nst2 Cu 2.9 Fe 0.1 SnS 4 unknown Transmission Transmission Unk All spectra were registered under vacuum at 80 K, in the Transmission mode, both at the Cu and Sn K-edges (8979 and 29200 eV, respectively). In addition to the samples of Table 1, most of the main sulphide minerals relevant to this investigation were analysed: CuS, covellite, Cu 2 S, chalcocite, CuFeS 2 , chalcopyrite, Cu 5 FeS 4 , bornite, Cu 3 AsS 4 , enargite; SnS, herzenbergite. Also non-sulfide minerals were investigated at the Sn K-edge: SnO, SnO 2 , SnCl 2 .2H 2 O, SnSO 4 . EXAFS data were extracted from the raw absorption coefficient spectrum with the ATHENA code. Data were analysed in the k-range, k = [2.8-12.0] Å -1 , and were Fourier transformed in the R interval, R = [0.8-6] . Å</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">-Results</head><p>In general, at both Cu and Sn K edges, the three stannite samples exhibit spectra adequately close to those of the unknown samples. As a consequence, we are confident that these three standards represent a good reference for the interpretation of the EXAFS data of our sulfides. In the following we will focus our comparison only to these references.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">-Experimental procedure</head><p>The samples consist of thin films of binary, ternary and quaternary sulphides of CuS, Cu x Sn y S z , and Cu x Sn y Zn w S z deposited by ECALD (ElectroChemical Atomic Layer Deposition) onto a single crystal of Ag( <ref type="formula">111</ref>). This technique allows to obtain a layer-by-layer growth of these compounds, based on a particular phenomena of surface limited deposition of the elements, namely UPD (Underpotential Deposition) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Every samples is realized performing n cycles of deposition of a chosen sequence. The samples investigated are summarized in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Three different samples of ternary compound were prepared changing the stoichiometric ratio between the number of layers of Cu and Sn.</p><p>Table 4 Sample name Chemical formula Sequence of deposition Number of cycles (n) label Bin CuS Ag/S/(Cu/S) n 20 binCuS20A5 Ter1 Cu x Sn y S z Ag/S/(Cu/S/Sn/S) n 10 ter117G Ter2 Cu x Sn y S z Ag/S/(Cu/S/Cu/S/Sn/S) n 7 ter21H Ter3 Cu x Sn y S z Ag/S/(Cu/S/Sn/S/Sn/S) n 7 ter127E Quat Cu x Sn y Zn w S z Ag/S/(Cu/S/Sn/S/Zn/S) n 7 quat1117L</p><p>The XAS spectra were acquired in the Fluorescence mode, having put the Ag electrode in the Grazing incidence position. In this way, the synchrotron radiation is only partly incident on the film. Acquisition times were significantly long, in order to improve the Intensity-to-noise ratio. Spectra were registered at both the Cu and Sn K edges, but in this case, the experiment were unsuccesful, due to the overlap of a Silver fluorescence spectrum in the energy region of the Sn K edge. Instead, at the Cu K edge, the spectra were acquired with conceivable easyness, although the total counts were low. Thus, most of the experimental beamtime was dedicated to the acquisition of multiple scans over the set of available films (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The registered spectra in the pre-edge and XANES region are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>. The spectra are apparently different for both edge position and XANES features: e.g., only two samples exhibit a "white line" unsual for tetrahedral Cu in sulfide). We decided to compare these two samples, ... and ..., with some oxidised standard, to verify if some oxidation has occurred in the sample (before or during the sample preparation and the measurements). The Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> evidence that only a partial similarity can be fostered between the spectra of the films and those of Cu(II) oxide and Cu carbonate (malachite). Accordingly, if present only a partial oxidation can be suggested from these data. Nevertheless, as evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>, the resemblance of these features with those of bulk stannite-like materials is very poor.  The EXAFS spectra of the thin films are obviously noisy, and only a limited k-range can be useful for the structural investigation (Figg. 8a-8c). Nevertheless, it is apparent a significant change in the period of the EXAFS, that implies significant differences at least in the distance of the first coordination shell. a b c Figure 8 -EXAFSs registered in the thin films: a) binary film, b) ternary films, c) quaternary film.

This is mainly due to the fact that Cu-S distances are significantly shorter.</p><p>2) although a precise attribution of the valence states is not yet available (spectra are under interpretation), it appears likely that Cu is mainly monovalent 3) only a partialy oxidation of the film could be considered: if present, this phenomenon appears not ubiquitous nor prevailing</p></div>			</div>
