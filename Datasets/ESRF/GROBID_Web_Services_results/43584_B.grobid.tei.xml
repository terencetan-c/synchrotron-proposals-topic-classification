<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In our proposal we suggested investigating x-ray diffraction from fibrillar and nano-crystalline deposits that naturally occure in granulocytes (purified core particles) of human eosinophiles and Drosophila Melanogaster larva crystal cells. In view of a small size of fibrillar and crystalline deposits, approximately ~1μm 3 or less, to date ID-13 is the only beamline capable of producing a suitable x-ray beam of 1μm 2 , or sub-micron size, for our purpuses. We find that these type of experiments are quite new and therefore, they initially focused on assessing our ability to obtain an x-ray diffraction images of deposits that show a high degree of symmetry and naturally appear in living cells, and also to evaluate effects of various sample preparation techniques on their ability to diffract.</p><p>Experimental setup: Due to the nano-meter size of our samples, we found that in order to record the weakest possible reflections, it is crucial to obtain the highest possible sensitivity and to reduce effects of background scattering. Therefore, the experimental setup invovled a secondary aperture; it was prepared of a lead sheet and mounted between the collimator and the beamstop. The apperture was skillfuly installed by our local contact, Dr. Manfred Burghammer to whom we are greateful for help and suport with our experiments. All samples were previously cryo-cooled and applied in a stream of 100K nitrogen gas.</p><p>Sample preparation: All sample were mounted onto various types of macromolecular crystallography cryomounts and were frozen in either liquid nitrogen or propane; several cryo protecting solutions were tested.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the optimal freezing procedurs include: 1. Samples of eosinophil granules provide best results if concentrated and frozen in a nitrogen streem, immedietely prior to their application, and MiTeGen kapton loops are the most suitable for their mounting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). 2. D. Melanogaster cells containing crystalline deposits were genetically marked with a fluorescent protein in order to ease on identification and centering, it was performed under a laser illumination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). MiTeGen kapton grids with 10μm aperture seemed to produce best results, and freezing in liquid propane reduced formation of ice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-ray data collection:</head><p>In case of eosiniphil granules, static x-ray diffraction images were collected in a mesh scanning mode, with steps of 2μm. Such a technique was applied since it is not possible to observe fibrillar deposits inside granules under a light microscope. Therefore, we had obtain images separated by periodic distances, thus attempting to identify points of interest. Images which showed increased low resolution scattering were further analyzed for diffracted reflections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Similar mesh scans were performed over the fluorescent D.Melanogaster cells. As in eosinophil granules, images that exhibited a increased low resolution scattering were further analyzed.</p><p>Preliminary results: X-ray diffraction image of eosinophil granules showed three major arc-shapped reflections at resolution of 4.8Å, 48Å and 59Å. D. Melanogater cells showed reflections at 4Å, 26Å and 39Å. We are currently analyzing results and would like to perform more experiments, collect more data on our existing samples and try specimens with other naturally appearing crystals and fibrils inside cells.
