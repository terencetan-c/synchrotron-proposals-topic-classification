<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Orbital and Electric Polarons in the Bilayer Manganites</p><p>Experiment number: 28-01-713 Beamline: BM28 Date of experiment: from: 15/02/06 to: 21/02/06 Date of report: 23/10/06 Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): Dr. S. Brown Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Peter Hatton* Dr. Thomas Beale* Mr Gordon Pearce* Report:</p><p>The beamtime was awarded in order to look at the effects of previously observed ordering in the bilayer manganites, using resonant scattering and in addition with an applied magnetic field. As such, this was one of the first user experiments using the 4 T magetic field specicifally developed. We therefore expected that we would encounter difficulties due to using a new piece of equipment.</p><p>The experiment was split into two sections, studying the bilayer manganites La 2-2x Sr 1+2x Mn 2 O 7 , initially with x=0.4, and then x=0.5. The initial section concerned the polaron ordering that we have previously obserbed using very high energy x-ray diffraction. This ordering is not very highly ordered, and as such forms weak diffuse scatter within the brillion zone. Because of the nature of the ordering, we were unsure as to whether we would be able to see it using incident x-rays at the Mn K edge. The aim of the experiment was to perform energy scans at the Mn K edge, as well as observe any magnetic field dependence. With no field, it was possible to use a Bicron detector (field sensitive), and we were able to observe the weak diffuse scatter. The energy dependence of the polarons was measured in the vicinity of the Mn K edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), suggesting that these are not simply uncorrelated charge ordering of the manganese ions, as there is no Mn resonant enhancement. In order to use a magnetic field, a suitable, non-field sensitive detector was needed, however these detectors measured a lower signal due to a reduced size. As such, it was impossible to measure the weak diffuse polarons with these detectors.</p><p>The second section of this experiment concerned the charge and orbital ordering in the half doped bilayer LaSr 2 Mn 2 O 7 . This ordering has been measured extensively, although not with an applied magnetic field. Superlattice reflections were observed with the sample at 180 K, at both the charge order (h±0.5,k±0.5,l) and orbital order (h±0.25,k±0.25,l) positions. The intensity of these signals was measured with respect to an applied field. Both of these signals were observed to decrease in intensity significantly (~30%), in contrast to the crystallographic Bragg peaks.</p><p>In addition to observing the intensity of the superlattice peaks, we monitored their energy dependence with increased magnetic field. No change was observed with applied field.</p><p>These results complement earlier results taken using high energy x-ray diffraction. The observed magnetic field dependence suggests that a ferromagnetic influence can be induced into the bilayer magnetics with a relatively low field, as such magnetic ordering has been shown to reduce the long range ordering.</p><p>Despite a few configurations with the magnet and cryostat, the experiment was on the whole succesful. We intend to publish these results in the near future in J. Phys. Cond. Matter. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Energy dependence of the polarons measured in La 1.2 Sr 1.8 Mn 2 O 7</figDesc><graphic coords="2,332.16,434.48,245.52,189.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
