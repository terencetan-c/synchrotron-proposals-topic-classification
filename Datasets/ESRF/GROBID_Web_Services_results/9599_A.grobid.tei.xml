<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in doped antiferromagnetic cuprate materials there has been a renewed interest in low dimensional quantum antiferromagnets. A linear S = l/2 chain with antiferromagnetic interaction along the chain interacting with the three-dimensional phonons can lead to a spin-Peierls (SP) phase transition. A dimerization of the spin chain below the transition temperature TSP leads to the formation of a non-magnetic singlet ground state. The transition is called a spin-Peierls transition because it is a magnetic analog of a Peierls transition in quasi-one-dimensional conductors. This transition was initially observed only in a few organic compounds. The discovery of a SP-state in the inorganic compound CuGeOs [l] h as renewed strong interest in this phenomenon. Recently Isobe and Ueda [2] h ave discovered a new inorganic spin-Peierls system a'-NaVnOs. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on both polycrystalline samples [2] and single crystals [3] have shown that a spin gap opens below Tsp M 34 K and Raman scattering measurements [3] show a crystallographic distortion below Tsp. Thus a'-NaVzOs seems to be a spin-Peierls compound with the highest critical temperature so far known Tsp = 34 K. Here we report the results of our synchrotron X-ray diffraction investigations on a single crystal of a'-NaVaOs.</p><p>Single crystals of a'-NaVaOs were grown by a self-flux method. A single crystal of dimensions of about 6 x 0.6 x 0.1 mm3 was mounted inside the helium cryostat of the triple-axis diffractometer of the high energy beam line ID15 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The X-ray wavelength was 0.105 8, which corresponds to the X-ray energy of 114.3 keV. We detected superlattice reflections below TSP = 34 K corresponding to the cell doubling along a and b and quadrupling along c. We measured the intensities of several main and superlattice reflections. The superlattice reflections are relatively strong in the X-ray experiment being of the order of about 10-l of the main reflections. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the temperature variation of the integrated intensity of the zfy superlattice reflection. The intensity of this reflection decreases continuously and becomes zero at TSP m 34 K showing that the phase transition is of the second order. We have measured thermal expansion anomaly due to the magnetoelastic effects close to the spin-Peierls transition temperature. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the temperature variation of y for the 005 reflection. For systems without any phase transition one expects the y value to attain the zero value at very low temperature. In the present case however the y value decreases with decreasing temperature but then starts increasing continuously at TSP. We interpret this abrupt increase in the y value due to the magnetoelastic coupling. The results of the present synchrotron X-ray diffraction study together with similar neutron diffraction investigations performed at the four-circle triple-axis diffractometer of the ILL on the same single crystal allow us to reach a very important conclusion about the structural modulation of a'-NaVzOs below TSP. The very fact that the intensities of the superlattice reflections in the X-ray diffraction experiment are of the order of 10-l those of the main reflections whereas in the neutron diffraction the corresponding ratio is of the order of 10m4 implies that the structural modulation below TSP is essentially due to vanadium atoms. A possible model for the low temperature structure can be obtained by "decorating" the zig-zag vanadium chains parallel to the crystallographic b axis. The doubling of the b axis can be easily achieved by modulating the V-V distance (short S and long L). In the high temperature phase they are equal (D) along the zig-zag chain. So if one has the sequence S-L-L-L-S-L.. . in the low temperature phase instead of the sequence D-D-D-D-D.. . at room temperature then the unit cell is doubled along b. If we also decorate the next parallel chains as we move along the a axis like L-S-L-L-L-S.. . , L-L-S-L-L-L-S. . . and L-L-L-S-L-L-L-S . . . we get cell doubling along the a axis. Now it is easy to stack these chains in the a-b plane along c in order to get the cell quadrupling along the c axis, although there are several ways of doing this. Such a model has indeed given a reasonable fit to the low temperature X-ray diffraction data which are limited to one reciprocal layer.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p>Experiment report form, August 1995 (LATEX Veraion 1.0)</p></note>
