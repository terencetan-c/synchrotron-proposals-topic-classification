<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the allocated beam time in ID22 (experiment <ref type="bibr">HS-1937)</ref>, in situ measurements of the solubility of strontianite (SrCO 3 ) in high pressure-high temperature (HP-HT) aqueous fluids (up to 11.60 GPa and 400…C) have been performed using externally heated diamond anvil cells (DAC) and Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF).It was the continuation of an experiment performed on ID22 during November 2002 (report HS-1632), which probed the feasibility of in situ measurements of mineral dissolution rates at HP-HT conditons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The cell was loaded with a single crystal of SrCO 3 , together with a ruby chip (pressure jauge), in Rbbearing aqueous solutions of known concentrations (0.01m or 0.1m). In some cases, 0.5m NaCl solutions were added in order to test the effect of chlorine in the dissolution of the mineral. The composition of the fluid surrounding the crystal was analysed in situ by monitoring the X-ray fluorescence of Sr 2+ cations, as long as chemical equilibrium was reached. These analyses are possible thanks to the high resolution monochromatic beam (18 keV) provided by the KB focusing mirror, which ensured a focal spot of 2x5 µm 2 at the position of the cell and a flux of 5.10 10 photons/s. X-ray fluorescence was collected in forward transmission geometry using a silicon solid stated detector set at 10 degrees from the incident beam.</p><p>The strategy for computing the molality of Sr 2+ in the fluid in equilibrium with the crystal, was to use the known concentration of Rb + as internal standard for the dissolution process. For this reasons, the fluorescence yields of Rb and Sr were previously calibrated in this experimental configuration (i.e., loaded in the DAC), using solutions with known concentrations of these elements. The calibrations allowed to retrieved the experimental correction factor accounting for the optimisation of the fluorescence yield for Sr atoms when a 18 keV beam is used. Calibrations also showed that quantitative analyses of Sr-bearing solutions can be accomplished down to the 20 ppm level using forward transmission geometry.</p><p>0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 500 1000 1500 200 S r 2 + m o l a l i t y i n t Elapsed time (s) 300 …C 4.85 GPa 1.78 GPa 2.76 GPa 2.80 GPa Filled symbols: Compression path Open symbols: Decompression path</p><p>Dissolution experiments of strontianite were then performed at different pressures (up to 11.60 GPa) along isothermal paths (25, 150, 200, 300 and 400 C). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> shows images of the experimental charge in the sample chamber during an isothermal compression-decompression path at 300 ¡C.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates typical X-ray fluorescence spectra recorded in 0.1mRb-chlorine free (3.a) and 0.1mRb-0.5m NaCl (3.b) fluids in equilibrium with SrCO 3 , during isothermal compressions at 400 C. It can be observed that SrCO 3 solubility strongly increases between 1.57 and 5.60 GPa in chlorine-free solutions (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.a) whereas SrCO 3 solubility in 0.5m NaCl is almost constant in the studied P-range (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.b). This result is in contradiction with previous low pressure solubility and partitioning studies in quenched samples which show that saline fluids (NaCl) are good solvents at crustal conditions due to the complexing of cations with chlorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. In dense fluids, ion-pairing must be inhibited by the elevated value of the dielectric A shapeless SrCO 3 cristal is initially in equilibrium with the solution (P=2,8GPa, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>.a). The dissolution is enhanced as pressure is increased at 300 C, the crystal reduces in size. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.b). Then, during the decompression path, recrystallisation occurs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>.c) and the initial shapeless crystal developps well-defined faces when the starting contidions are reached again (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1.d</ref>). This evidence of dissolution and reprecipitation during the experiment shows that equilibrium can be reach from both undersaturation and saturation side. Solubility at a given P-T point were obtained by analysing the fluid every 5 minutes as long as chemical equilibrium was reached. First analysis of the fluid (t = 0, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) was performed approximately half an hour after changing the P-T conditions. Kinetic data reveal that this time was enough for equilibrated the reaction at the highest temperatures investigated in this study (300 and 400 C).   This experiment gives the first data on the dissolution rate and solubility of strontium carbonate at conditions relevant to cold subduction zones.</p><p>At the present, data have been proceseed and the measured Sr 2+ concentrations are being used to determine the solubility constant (K s ) of SrCO 3 at HP-HT conditions, allowing further thermodynamic modelling of carbonate dissolution. These results will be presented in 2 international meetings and we expect to prepare a manuscript about the geochemistry of carbonate solubility in HP-HT fluids.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Isabelle Martinez * Laboratoire de Geochimie des isotopes stables, IPGP-Paris VII Carmen Sanchez-Valle * Laboratoire de Sciences de la Terre, CNRS-ENS Lyon-UCB Lyon 1 Isabelle Daniel * Laboratoire de Sciences de la Terre, CNRS-ENS Lyon-UCB Lyon 1 Bruno Reynard * Laboratoire de Sciences de la Terre, CNRS-ENS Lyon-UCB Lyon 1 Pascal Philippot * Laboratoire de Geosciences Marines, CNRS-IPGP, Paris VI-VII Alexandre Simionovici ESRF, Grenoble</figDesc></figure>
