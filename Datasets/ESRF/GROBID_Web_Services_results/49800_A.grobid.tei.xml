<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to in situ observe the formation and stability of Mg 2 C under high pressures and high temperatures, the mixture of Mg and glassy carbon has been compressed to 18 GPa and probed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) during heating. The sequence of XRD patterns has been obtained at ID07 beamline of ESRF using newly installed large-volume press allowing to probe the large enough amount (1-3 mm 3 ) of light-element samples to obtain a good quality powder diffraction paterns under pressures at least up to 20 GPa. Pressure and temperature have been estimated using the p-V-T equations of state of Mg and MgO.</p><p>The formation of Mg 2 C was observed at ~1500 K below the magnesium melting temperature which can be estimated as 1600-1850 K at 18 <ref type="bibr">GPa (Figure)</ref>. This can be explained by metastable eutectic melting of Mg and its interaction with glassy carbon. After the formation of Mg 2 C, the isothermal decompression at ~1550 K has been performed, and at pressures below ~12 GPa the new reflections have been observed, indicative that Mg 2 C is stable only above ~12 GPa at 1550 K. taken during compression to 18 GPa (at 300 K), heating to 1550 K (at ~18 GPa) and subsequent isothermal decompression (at ~1550 K). The formation of Mg 2 C was observed during heating at 18 GPa after the non-equilibrium melting of Mg at ~1500 K. At 1550 K Mg 2 C decomposes at the pressure of ~ 12 GPa.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure.
