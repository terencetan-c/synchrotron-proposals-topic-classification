<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The project objectives were: (i) to reveal the real phonon dispersion in FF nano-and microtubes, and (ii) to determine several related quantities (sound velocities, elastic constants, phonon density of states and specific heat) essential to their applications in nanotechnology. To do this we requested to use ID28 beamline, and 9 beamshifts were allocated.</p><p>During the project we have performed single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments on several individual FF microtubes grown from the solution and have chosen the best one with pure single crystal diffraction pattern without any evidence of twins or poly-crystallinity. At the same time we have chosen the working temperature (240 K) and conducted several experiments at this temperature. It is essential that we also revealed the gradual damage of the samples under the synchrotron beam and determined the parameters for more or less nondestructive regime of measurements. The estimated time for one measurement was about 6 minutes.</p><p>The chosen sample was then used for performing inelastic X-ray scattering measurements with optimized parameters. After the long settings of the setup we could measure the inelastic X-ray scattering in the vicinity of M-points of Brillouin zone. The obtained spectra are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. No peaks corresponding to inelastic scattering was observed. Probably the reason is insufficient intensity of the X-ray beam, which was reduced because of the tube damage. During the sample selection we noticed the formation of a set of additional reflexes in X-ray patterns of microtubes dried for several hours at elevated temperature. An example of such additional reflexes is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The observed reflexes copy the main ones, but lies between them. Their period is 7 times smaller, than the period of main reflexes that corresponds to formation of superstructure with the 7x period of lattice parameter along caxis of the tube. The nature of this effect is not clear yet and requires additional investigation using the facilities of ESRF. It is related to the behavior of nanoconfined water in the hydrophilic environment and should be studied in the future. To conclude, we suppose that regardless the problems with observation of inelastic X-ray scattering the project SC-4714 brought about new important results. Formation of the superstructures in FF nanotubes during their drying was not reported earlier. For sure, revealing the nature of these superstructures is of importance for understanding the role of water in phase transitions and physical properties of FF nanotubes. The obtained results will be published in high-impact scientific journals and presented at international conferences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
