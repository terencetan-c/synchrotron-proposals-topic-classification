<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The oligomerization properties of nonfarnesylated-(nf-)hGBP1 after nucleotide addition were reported first from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. Without nucleotides, nf-hGBP1 was reported to elute as a monomer, whereas after addition of non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs like GppNHp it was classified as dimer. Furthermore, in the presence of GDP and aluminium fluoride (GDP•AlF x ), which mimicks the transition state of hydrolysis, the apparent size was further increased and proposed to appear as tetramer.</p><p>When the purification of farn-hGBP1 was first described by Fres et al., it was proposed that hGBP1 undergoes structural changes after farnesylation and the surface therefore gets less hydrophobic, as can be seen from hydrophobic interaction chromatography. It was proposed that the C terminus is probably internally hidden after farnesylation. In this SEC-SAXS experiment on BM29, we want to compare the structural differences between the ground states (nucleotide free) of the unmodified and farnesylated protein in solution. We found differences for farn-and nf-hGBP1 in SAXS measurements and did further investigations using AUC, DLS and analytical SEC to clarify the origin of the differences. During further investigations, also using SEC-SAXS, we are able to distinguish a purely monomeric appearance of farn-hGBP1 in solution opposed to the monomer-dimer mixture of nf-hGBP1 in solution. With all different techniques, we found a concentration dependent equilibrium with a dimer fraction of around 17% under standard conditions (2 mg/ml or 30 µM in Tris buffered solution at pH 7.9) for the commonly used nf-hGBP1 even in nucleotide free solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>SEC-SAXS was measured on BM29 using different protein concentrations of farnesyl (farn) hGBP1 and non-farnesylated (nf) hGBP1. NF-hGBP1 was measured nucleotide free (NF) condition and in the presence of nucleotides GppNHp and AlFx-GDP that induce formation of higher order oligomers.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the SEC profiles of nf-hGBP1 and farn-hGBP1 are compared. Farn-hGBP1 elutes as monomeric species, while dimers and tetramers are observed for nf-hGBP1.  SEC-SAXS and batch mode SAXS data of nf-hGBP1 in the presence of the different solvent conditions is presented in figures 3 to 6.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation of SEC-SAXS data using structural modelling</head><p>The calculated SAXS profile of nf-hGBP1 monomer is compared to measured SEC-SAXS data of nf-hGBP1 monomer in figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Although theoretical curves first seem to agree with experimetal data, a close inspection of the residues shows systematic deviations from the measured data. A systematically better interpretation is obtained, when multiparameter set of experimental FRET &amp; EPR &amp; SEC-SAXS data is used for model building, see figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. The obtained model gives a significantly better agreement with experimental data as observed in the residuals.</p><p>Rigid body modelling was done to get a structural model of the nf-hGBP1 dimer. The result of the modelling approach is shown in figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. 0.01 0.1 0.1 1 10 100 I(q) Crystal structure c = 3.05 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 I(q)*q 2 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 q / Å -1 -15 -10 -5 0 5 10 Residuals Figure 8: Theoretical SAXS curve of refined nf-hGBP1 monomer structure. 0.01 0.1 0.1 1 10 100 I(q) SAXS + FRET + EPR c = 1.17 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 I(q)*q 2 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 q / Å -1 -4 -2 0 2 4 Residuals Figure 9: Rigid body modelling of the nf-hGBP1 dimer gave a good fit against the measured SEC-SAXS data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1: SEC elution profiles of hGBP1 with bound farnesyl (farn) and non-farnesylated (nf) state.
