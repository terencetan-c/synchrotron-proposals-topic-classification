<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This study was aimed to investigate whether synchrotron radiation (SR) can enhance cisplatin (CDDP) cytotoxicity in two different human cancer cell lines of non-glial origin (A549 non small-cell lung cancer and IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cells) and in human glioblastoma cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Three different series of measurements have been performed within this proposal. This is the report for the third serie that took place on February 2011 as recuperation day for technical problems that occured on December 2010 not allowing the measurements on glioblastoma CSCs cells. In this experimental session the beamtime has been used in order to investigate whether synchrotron radiation (SR) can enhance cisplatin (CDDP) cytotoxicity in two different human glioblastoma CSCs: VIPI and DEMI cell lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell preparation</head><p>Glioblastoma CSCs were plated in (20000 cells/well) into flat bottom 96-well plates coated with laminin in DMEM/F-12 and Neurobasal (1:1) (Invitrogen), supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml recombinant human bFGF (Milteniy) and 20 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (Milteniy), 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). After 24 hr both cell lines were treated with CDDP 3 µM for 24 hr. Untreated cells were used as control. After treatment plates were taken to the ID17 beamline to be irradiated and immediately washed with drug free medium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Irradiation</head><p>Glioblastoma CSCs cells were irradiated with a total dose of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy. Cells were irradiated either above (78.8 KeV) and below (78.0 KeV) the Pt K absorption edge (platinum K-edge = 78.395) according to the following schedule: Cell survival determination 96 hr after irradiation cell survival was determined by Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) cell viability assay. At the end of the incubation period cells were fixed with 10% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid and stained for 15 minutes, after which the excess dye was removed by washing repeatedly with 1% (vol/vol) acetic acid. The protein-bound dye was dissolved in 10 mM Tris base solution for OD determination at 510 nm using a microplate reader. The results obtained on DEMI glioblastoma CSCs and VIPI glioblastoma CSCs are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> respectively. Each experimental data point is represented as average value obteined from four replicates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Exposure to SR significantly enhances CDDP activity in both DEMI and VIPI human glioblastoma CSCs at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy at both 78.8 keV (above Pt K-edge) and 78.0 KeV (below Pt K-edge) for both the CDDP concentrations used. Both cell lines, but in particular DEMI cells, showed a high resistance to SR. The CDDP dose used (3 µM) induced about 50% survival in both cell lines while a 10% was expected. In these conditions the SR effect is hidden by the CDDP cytotoxicity. Further experiments would be usefull to clarify the CDDP toxicity in these cell lines in order to find a CDDP dose inducing between 5 and 10% of cel death.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>3µM +SR irradiation dose 1Gy 7.
