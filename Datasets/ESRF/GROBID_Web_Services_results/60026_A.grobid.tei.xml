<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Beamline Performance/ Use of Beamtime:</head><p>-There were no technical problems during our allocated beam time and we were able to conduct all our planned measurements. We were very satisfied with the beamline support in advance and are excited about the data we were able to collect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results:</head><p>-There were three major objectives that we aimed to achieve with our measurements i) Data collection for ongoing User projects for finalizing publications/planning further experiments ii) Identification of suitable systems that can be used for future time-resolved measurements at the BioSAXS beamline P12 (EMBL Hamburg @ PETRA III, DESY) iii) Collection of data for submission as Bench-Mark proteins in the SASBDB (<ref type="url" target="http://www.sasbdb.org/">www.sasbdb.org</ref>)</p><p>-The following data sets were collected Sample # data sets (subtracted data) Comments/Next Steps i) User Projects DNA origami structures 9 Data being used to support proposal at SLAC phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 9 Data being prepared to include in publication ii) Systems for Time resolved measurements Ferritin -pH induced dissociation and re-association 7 Successful dissociation of Apoferritin into smaller oligomeric states (see Figure 1) System will be used in future experiments Insulin -ligand prevented fibrillation 9 Data sets collected at different pH's in the presence/absence of scavengers Problems with buffer matching Catalase-pH vs salt induced dissociation 14 Generation of different dissociation models  further analysis to understand these differences</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,72.00,359.76,339.96,267.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
