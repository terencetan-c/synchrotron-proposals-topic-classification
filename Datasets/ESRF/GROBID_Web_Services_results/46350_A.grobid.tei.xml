<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In an industrial reactor catalysts are used in pre-shaped forms, i.e. as millimetre-sized catalyst bodies. As such, a study examining deactivation in real catalyst samples needs to consider the problem from a spatial perspective in order to assess quantitatively, macroscopic effects leading to catalyst deactivation e.g. 'shell progressive', 'shrinking core' and 'pore mouth' effects. To the best of our knowledge, such a spatially-resolved systematic study on the S-poisoning of pre-shaped catalyst materials is not available in the open literature. The results contained in this report details a study using both invasive and non-invasive characterization techniques in order to understand the process by which sulfur poisoning leads to a loss in catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO catalysts for the water gas shift reaction. We demonstrate in particular how the technique of XRD-CT revealed that these catalysts deactivate via the solid-state transformation of the active Cu/ZnO phase(s) to the inactive CuS/ β-ZnS phases respectively.</p><p>In order to determine the spatial distribution of the phases present in the extrudate samples, 2D intensity distribution maps were produced using the following 'diagnostic' peaks: Cu (111), ZnO (002), CuO (111), CuS ( <ref type="formula">103</ref>  Tomographic XRD-CT confirmed that the formation of the β-ZnS phase and previously unobserved crystalline CuS and Cu 2 S sulfided phases, formed via the reaction between H 2 S and the initial Cu and ZnO phases is the principle mode by which sulfur poisons Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst bodies for the WGS reaction. The resultant sulfided CuS phase is also mobile leading to Cu redistribution towards the sample edge, leading to promoted growth (sintering) of the Cu species which will also adversely affect activity. The ability of the Cu/ZnO catalyst body material to act as a H 2 S trap ensures against a rapid loss of catalyst activity although it appears that the catalyst body becomes inactive before all Cu/ZnO (that which remains in the core) has been sulfided. This suggests a diffusion problem related caused by the formation of Cu/Zn sulfided phases (from the Cu/ZnO phases) either by the blocking of pores by mobile sulfides or else through destruction of the internal pore structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Andrew M.

The colour maps show the distribution of the phases presented in the 1D plot and furthermore revealed changes in 2D spatial distribution with increasing [H 2 S]. The first key observations concern the phases initially present in the sample and their consumption with increasing [H 2 S] in the feed. The metallic Cu phase lost intensity and began to shrink towards the core of the extrudate (Figure1left hand side). The distribution of CuO (111) matches closely that of the metallic Cu phase although the intensity of this signal increased between 200 -350 ppm before being observed at its weakest and smallest (in terms of spatial distribution) at 500 ppm. This increase in CuO content between 200 to 350 ppm [H 2 S] relative to the amount of metallic Cu is most likely caused by differences in the passivation process. A similar distribution/intensity profile was seen for the ZnO response (although the profiled peak comprises a contribution for both CuO (-111) and ZnO(101)). Conversely then the new phases that evolved possess an inverse distribution (a broad shell around a core) to that of the initial phases with increasing [H 2 S]. With increasing [H 2 S] the shell of CuS and β-ZnS became thicker, concentrating further into the sample. Interestingly the 'egg white' distribution is itself non-uniform with greater signal intensity seen at the very periphery of the sample (termed an 'egg-shell' distribution). The Cu 2 S phase in contrast is very much concentrated as an egg-shell.</figDesc></figure>
