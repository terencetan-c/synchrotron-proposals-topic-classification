<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>During</head><p>the beamtime MA-5273, (DOI: 10.15151/ESRF-ES-656089266), performed between March 1 st and March 3 rd 2022 at ID15b, ESRF, single crystals of inderite and inderborite have been compressed, at ambient temperature, up to ⁓17 and ⁓10 GPa respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), using helium as pressure-transmitting medium. The elastic behaviour and the structure evolution at atomic scale have been successfully investigated. Both indertite and inderbortite display phase transitions. Surprising enough, if the pressure at which the phase transition occur in inderborite is perfectively in trend with the previous studies on hydrated borates, inderite is clearly an out layer (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A paper on inderite has been written and will be submitted in mid-February 2023; the paper will address in details the structure of the high-pressure polymorph of inderite and its strain anisotropy (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) For inderborite, few more months are required but we are confident that the acquired data will be published before the end of 2023.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remarks</head><p>Overall, ID15b produced high-quality data and the results are really promising: one paper is about to be submitted and we hope to publish the second before the end of 2023. ID15b has proved to be the ideal beamline for these experiments due to the small-size of the beam, its Eiger2X 9M detector and its user-friendly set-up. Due to these encouraging results we will submit, in the framework of a broader project (aiming to study the high-pressure and temperature stability of hydrated borates), further proposals on other hydrated borates. This will provide useful information to better understand the P-T stability of hydrated borates.
