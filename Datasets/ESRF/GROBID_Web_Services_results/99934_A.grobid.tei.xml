If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation.  The performed measurements allowed for obtaining benchmarking information with regard to co-relation of For all these compounds, the isomer shifts (I.S.) and quadrupole splitting parameters (EQ) were extracted by fitting the experimental NFS spectra measured vs time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A model was developed with which both nuclear forward spectra and Mӧssbauer data were fitted simultaneously.</p><p>The allocated beamtime was not enough to perform the measurements for osmium compounds in oxidation states +8 and +2 (which are crucial as these are the two extrema among the systems of interest), as well as to carry out measurements at lHe temperature. The NIS spectra were measured for four from nine available compounds, since these are time-consuming measurements. Under such circumstances it seems imperative to request additional beamtime.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

The data acquisition procedure was smooth and the quality of the obtained data was excellent. The nuclear forward scattering (NFS) of complexes 1-9 were different in accord with their different coordination environment and symmetry. In addition, nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) spectra of complexes 1, 4, 5, and 9 were measured. The raw NFS spectra for compounds 1 and 9 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, while NIS spectra are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
