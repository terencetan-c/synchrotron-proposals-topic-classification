<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of the proposed experiment was to identify local structure around Zr 4+ in early stages of Zr-based MOFs synthesis and the effects of synthesis conditions on this structure. It was planned to utilise a home-built reactor where the synthesis reaction could be followed in situ at elevated temperature (100 -120 C) and after constant heating. We envisaged to carry out measurements at Zr-and Ce-k-edges for these two reactions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The trial of the reactor was partially successful. After the consultation with the beamline scientists, it was realised that Ce should be measured at L-edge. However, for that low energy, the window in the glass reactor was too thick. The local contact(s) attempted to improve the reactor construction by cutting a hole in the glass and closing it with kaption foil. We managed to carry out two reactions in this way measuring the Ce-L-edges and Zr k-edge during the same reaction run. For the rest of the reactions, only Zr K-edge was measurered in the intact glass reactor. The heating was rather unstable varying within 10 o C. Taking into account this experience, the reactor will be modified for the future use. The trial of the reactor in this experiment, however, can be considered as successful. We obtained very good data, in EXAFS range for Zr and XANES range for Ce k-edge for a few in-situ reactions. The data are being analysed at the moment. In several reactions, MOF was obtained, which was and dried at the beamline with the subsequent XAS analysis. We could not measure simultanious XRD as planned in the proposal. In addition to the in-situ reactions, we have measured a great deal of ex-situ pellets:</p><p>-Ce, Zr references -MOFs and other porous materials after metal uptake to identifiy the adsorption sites -Nb additives in TiFe alloys -V addditives in TiFe alloys and metal vandates.</p><p>It total, about 70 pellets.</p><p>In this report we present the data from the in-situ reactions. The reports for other series of measurements were also prepared as requested but we have not found the opportunity to submit three reports. These reports are available upon request.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Ce-Zr fumerate mixed cluster and MOF series</head><p>In this series, we have investigated the formation of mixed Ce-Zr clusters and MOFs by varying Ce:Zr ratio of the precursors. The Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> below shows the in-situ data in XANES and EXAFS region for 0.75:0.25 ratio of the Ce-Zr cluster formation. The data were obtained in-situ at Zr k-edge during heating and continous mixing of the precursor solution. The data show gradual formation of the second-newighbour peak at 3.2 Ã… responsible for the Zr cluster formation in the solution.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Ce-Zr cluster formation from the precursors in 0.75:0.25 concentration.</p><p>We have found that the metal precursor ratio has an effect on the formation of MOF, for some ratios powders were obtained at the end of the measurements, which upon washing, drying and measuaring an XRD, shown the formation of Zr-MOF. For other concentrations, gel was obtained on the contrary. Data analysis is on progress. In parlell, we have completed the additional characterisation of the MOFs obtained in these experiments with TGA, XRD, BET, Raman and SEM. The main aim will be to conclude whether the foramtion of the mixed MOF was achieved. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 below shows the in-situ data at Ce L-edge for one of the experiments.
