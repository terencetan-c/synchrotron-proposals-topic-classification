<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Names and affiliations of applicants:</head><p>Prof. Stefan Tautz, Research Center Jülich, Germany Prof. Moritz Sokolowski, Bonn university, Germany Report: The aim of the experiment SI-1829 was to study the unbinding process of PTCDA molecule at Ag(110) surface upon co-adsorption of K atoms by means of NIXSW technique. It was expected that alkali atoms interacting with oxygen atoms of molecules will partially release them from the interface bonding with the substrate. This should be seen in an overall increase of the PTCDA adsorption height and a decrease of the molecular distortion. As a reference, we used the pure molecular phase of (3×3)PTCDA/Ag(110) to compare the molecular bonding distances and distortions before and after reaction with potassium.</p><p>NIXSW experiments were performed on ordered monolayers of PTCDA/Ag(110) and the mixed phase of PTCDA+K/Ag(110) according to preliminary developed preparation protocol (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In the experiments, 5 sets of NIXSW data were collected for C1s core level and 6 for N1s core level for PTCDA/Ag(110) and 9 sets for C1s</p><p>540 539 538 537 536 535 534 533 532 531 530 529 528 527 526 counts [a.u.] binding energy [eV] Experimental data XPS of Sum O1s XSW off Bragg energy Envelope Background Oanhydride Ocarboxylic Figure 2.

NIXSW for silver related core levels and Auger lines was recorded as well to control the quality of substrate crystallity. The resolution of the acquired photoemission spectra for O1s line was sufficient for performing the differential analysis, i.e. separating the contributions of carboxylic and anhydride oxygens.</p><p>To develop the corresponding fitting model (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), high resolution photoemission spectra of O1s peak were recorded.</p><p>Analysis of NIXSW data for the pure molecular phase of PTCDA on Ag(110) demonstrated a perfect reproducibility of the results obtained in different experiments. The adsorption height and geometry of PTCDA molecule measured in the experiment SI-1829 was found very close to what was measured during the previous experiment SI-1645 devoted to adsorption of PTCDA on silver surfaces of different orientations -( <ref type="formula">111</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>). The difference is within the experimental accuracy (&lt;0.05 Å). As it was expected, the thermal activated (annealing at 180°C) reaction of PTCDA molecules with adsorbed potassium atoms results in a noticeable change of the bonding distance and relaxation of internal molecular geometry <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>To solve the adsorption model completely, i.e. to define the exact position of potassium atoms in the layer after reaction, additional studies with complementary inhouse methods are currently in progress. Structural investigations are performed by high resolution SPA-LEED (Bonn) and low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy (Jülich) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>), while electronic properties are studied with angle resolved UPS (Jülich). The joint publication on results of these experiments will be prepared <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>[1] G. Mercurio, O. Bauer, A. Dehley, R. Temirov, S. Soubatch, M. Sokolowski, F.S.
