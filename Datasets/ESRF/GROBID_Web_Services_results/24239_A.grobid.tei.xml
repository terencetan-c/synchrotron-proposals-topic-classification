<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural study of the human small GTP-binding protein Rab11</head><p>Rab proteins are small GTP binding proteins involved in tethering and specific sorting between vesicles and membranes, allowing the vesicles to specifically address to the target membranes and fuse with them in order to release their cargo. Rab11a is implicated in the regulation of the trafficking events in the endocytic pathway at the recycling endosome. As all other small nucleotide binding proteins it cycles between an 'inactive' GDP-bound conformation and an 'active' GTP-bound form that can bind effectors proteins and thus transmits a signal or trigger an event. Given the high number of Rab proteins in the cell (as high as 60 in human), understanding the structural mechanism by which each Rab protein is specifically associated to a given pathway, in which it plays a key role, remains a major issue.</p><p>To elucidate the structural GDP/GTP cycle of Rab11a we undertook its crystallization in complex with GDP, the non-hydrolysable analog of GTP, GTPγS, and GTP.

In November 9 th , 2002, we have collected a complete dataset, at 1.7 Å of Rab11a(Q70L) in complex with GTP, on beamline ID14-1 (see table for dataset statistics). The structure is currently under refinement. The current model (R cryst = 22.0%, R free = 24.0%) displays a GDP molecule plus an inorganic phosphate in the nucleotide-binding site, and is represented in figure.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural study of human Interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1)</head><p>We used beam time on the beam line ID14-1 to collect data sets on protein crystals of the human Interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 1 G-domain (hGBP1 amino acid 1-317 38.2kDa) in complex with GppNHp (a non hydrolysable GTP analogue).</p><p>GBP1 is a large multidomain GTP-binding protein of 67 kDa. The protein is induced by interferon-gamma, an immuno-modulatory substance and has been shown to inhibit viral replication when overexpressed <ref type="bibr">(Anderson S. et al. (1999), Virology 256, 8-14)</ref> but its regulation mechanism is not understood. Biochemically the protein has the peculiarity among regulatory GTP-binding protein to undergo oligomerisation with a high concentration-dependent GTPase activity <ref type="bibr">(Prakash B. et al. (2000)</ref>, Nature 403, 567-71) and to hydrolyse GTP into GDP and also GMP. We have crystallized the protein in presence of GppNHp to elucidate the molecular mechanism of GTP hydrolysis &amp; the basis of co-operativity.</p><p>On Nov11, 2002 we have collected a complete data set on ID14-1 to a 2.75Å resolution on GBP1G-doamin crystals obtained with GppNHp. The crystals belong to space group I212121 with the unit cell constant a=54.903 Å,b=101.144Å,c=149.267 Å. Statistics on this data set from ID14-1 gave an overall Rmeas=6.9% (I/sI=13.85) for a resolution range from 20 to 2.74Å and an Rmeas=43.3% (I/sI=5.66) in the last resolution shell 2.91-2.74 Å. The molecular replacement solution has confirmed the presence of GppNHp in the crystal structure. Model building and refinement are finished with a final Rfree of 28% and Rfactor of 24%.</p></div>

Spacegroup P43212 a=b=65A; c=140A. Resolution 2.25A Completion 100% Rsym=4.1</p><p>The structure of this protein was previously solved by MAD data obtained from Se-Met crystals. The structure revealed an unexpected strong resemblance to the structure of a know enzyme. During this shift, three datasets were collected from crystals soaked with either triphosphate or diphosphate nucleotide. Unfortunately, analysis of the data did not reveal the presence of any nucleotide at the active site.</p><p>2)YDR533c (target 155 ). Spacegroup P21212 a=61A; b=166A; c=48A. Resolution 1.9A Completion 97.8% Rsym=8.1%</p><p>The structure and function of this orf are unknown. Structural similarity may exist with a protein from Methanococcus whose structure was recently solved in a structural genomics project at Berkeley. The protein is probably a protease but this has to be confirmed experimentally. As this orf contains no methionine with the exception of the N-terminal one for 237 residues, we constructed a quadruple methionine mutant. We have collected a dataset at 1.9A resolution from a crystal of this quadruple mutant. We need now to collect a full MAD dataset to solve the structure of this orf.</p><p>3)YGL148w (target 238) Spacegroup P1 a=58A; b=76A; c=91A; alpha=114°; beta=108°; gamma=90°.</p><p>Resolution 2.9A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completion 90% Rsym=4%</head><p>This orf codes for the enzyme chorismate sythase, which is key step in the stynthesis of the essential aromatic amino acids: Tyr and Phe. The crystal used to collect these data was the first one of this project to diffract. Work is underway to produce SeMet crystals of this orf. 4)LicT from Bacillus subtilis. Spacegroup P3221 a=b=48A; c=162.5A. Resolution 1.9A. Completion 100% Rsym=3.7%.</p><p>LicT is involved in the regulation of polyglucane degradation in Bacillus subtilis. LicT functions as a transcriptional antiterminator protein composed of two structural and functional domains: one RNA binding domain and a regulatory domain. From the same crystal, we have collected two datasets: one at low and one at high resolution. These data are currently used for the refinement of the structure. 5)human VpreB receptor complexed to its stromal ligand : human galectin-1. Spacegroup P212121 a=44A; b=58A; c=112A. Resolution 2.1 A Completion 99 % R-fact_total 0.077 VpreB is a receptor protein which is expressed on the surface of developing B-cells at the preB stage. There has been a longstanding effort in the purification and crystallization of this atypical receptor. Crystals of the V preB receptor were obtained in presence of its natural stromal ligand : galectin 1, a protein of about 120aa belonging to the mammalian lectin family. Analysis of the solvent content of the crystals showed that the whole complex could not be present in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by Molecular Replacement showing that indeed only the galectin1 crystallized. The structure is refined and is very similar to previous determined mammalian galectin structures. Studies are underway to characterize biochemically the interaction between VpreB and galectin in order to helps us to get crystals of the complex.</p></div>			</div>
