<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aim of the experiment and scientific background One of the objectives of the IMPRESS Integrated Project <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> is to develop more efficient and cheaper nickel catalyst powders, so called Raney-type nickel catalysts. These catalysts are widely used for hydrogenation reactions in industry. They are generally prepared from very finely divided Ni-Al 50-50 wt% alloys. Traditional research in this area focuses on the production of such powders by casting-andcrushing and subsequent leaching with NaOH solution to remove most of the aluminium in order to activate the catalyst <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. In the case of Raney-type Ni catalysts, mainly metallic Ni nanoparticles with a very large surface area remain after the leaching process. Until now the structure and microstructure of leached powders is not well known. The powder catalyst is mainly metallic nickel but some metallic aluminium remains at the near surface. The remaining aluminium could play an important role in the relationship between catalytic performance and microstructure. It is thus of great importance to know what is the structure and the composition of this aluminium at the near surface of Raney-type nickel catalysts. Adding a low amount (around 2 wt %) of a third metal (Cr, Ti, Mo…) as promoter is common to increase the catalytic performance of Raney-type nickel catalysts. The promoting effect can be on activity but also on selectivity towards one desired product which is of great industrial interest. XPS analysis shows that remaining aluminium and promoters are present in a significant amount at the near-surface. The relatively low amount of bulk aluminium (and also of promoters in case of doped material) is impossible to detect with conventional laboratory equipment. As Raney-type nickel catalysts consists of agglomerates of small particles (5-8 nm), transmission electron microscopy study is of little use.</p><p>High resolution XRD is essential to study the structure of the remaining aluminium and promoters of Raneytype nickel catalysts, as well as to provide further information on the characteristic of the Ni formed during the leaching process.</p><p>Nb. This experiment forms part of a general work-plan for the IMPRESS Integrated Project, as stated in a Memorandum of Understanding between ESRF, ILL and ESA in December 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>Ni-Al powders of selected composition and size, before and after leaching, were put into capillaries of 0.6 mm of inner diameter. Raney-type powders are highly pyrophoric and were encapsulated wet in order to avoid oxidation in contact with air. Powder diffraction patterns were recorded with a wavelenght λ = 0.39996710 Å and an exposure time of approximately two hours in order to get a sufficient statistic and identify the phases present even in small amount. 17 powders in total were measured during the allocated time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-leached powders :</head><p>The diffraction patterns of non-leached powders with a grain diameter in the range 53-150 µm displayed the characteristic peaks of the Ni 2 Al 3 , NiAl 3 and Al compounds. No other phases were detected in the powders containing the Cr promoter. Rietveld refinement of the diffractogams (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) enabled a quantitative evaluation of the phase fraction. The results are in agreement with previous analysis using neutron diffraction <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Several diffraction patterns of non-leached powders with a grain diameter &lt; 38 µm displayed small peaks which could not be investigated in previous study to due an overlapping with the reflections of others phase. The high angular resolution available on ID31 enabled to separate and identify some of them (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The characteristic peaks of the metastable decagonal quasicrystal </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leached powders :</head><p>A typical diffraction pattern obtained from a leached powder is shown figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. Large peaks corresponding to Raney-nickel are visible. Scattering at small angle which is characteristic of the Raneynickel structure is also present. The pronounced lorentzian shape of those peaks suggest a strong influence of the sample on the diffraction pattern implying very small cristallites. One can also notice the occurrence of sharp peaks. The latters were in most cases identified as belonging to bayerite Al(OH) 3 as shown figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. Bayerite is a by-product of the leaching reaction which can be written :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2(M-Al) (s) + 2OH - (aq) + 6H 2 O (l) → 2M (s) + 2Al(OH) - 4(aq) + 3H 2(g)</formula><p>Precipitation of Al(OH) 3 is mainly prevented by performing the leaching of powders using a solution with an excess of sodium hydroxide and washing the leached powders several times with demineralised water before strorage. It is then unexpected to detect this compound which was not mentionned in previous studies performed with less precise angular resolutions. However, bayerite peaks were found less pronounced in the case of powders leached on site only one week before the experiment. It is then suggested that bayerite formed during the storage of the powders. Furthermore, additional small sharp peaks of compounds which</p><p>are not yet determined were observerd in several samples. The latter observation emphasises the possible formation of compounds with time during storage. Their respective influence on the catalyst activity remains to determine. The influence of the addition of Cr-dopent on the pattern of leached powders is shown figure 3. Additional bayerite peaks previously mentionned are visible in the diffraction pattern of the non-doped powder as well as Raney-Ni peaks. Ni 2 Al 3 is also detected in the doped powder and Raney-Ni are broader. It can then be concluded that the leaching process is less efficient on the Ni 2 Al 3 phase and that Ni particles which formed are smaller when Cr is added to the precursor. No compounds containing Cr are detected. This suggest that a solid solution is formed with Cr atoms incorporated in the Ni or Ni 2 Al 3 lattices. Finally figure 4 displays the diffraction patterns after leaching of Ti-doped powders. Sharp and intense Ni 2 Al 3 and bayerite peaks appears with smaller broad peaks of Raney-Ni, still accompanied by scattering at small angle. No Al3Ti peaks are detected whereas this intermetallic compound has been identified in the intial atomised powders [3]. Like Cr, Ti could remains in the form of a solid solution. Preliminary Rietveld refinements were performed in order to determine if variations of the lattice parameters of Ni 2 Al 3 and Raney-Ni corroborate that assumption and no clear evidence were noticed. Further work are in progress to improve modelisation of the peak shape of the leached powders in order to provide quantitative measurements.
