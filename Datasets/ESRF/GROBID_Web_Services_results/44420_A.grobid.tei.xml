<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this study we have recorded WAXS &amp; MAXS (Wide &amp; Middle Angle X-Ray Scattering) patterns during uni-axial deformation of Poly(lactic acid) nanocomposites on the BM02 beamline using a homemade powerful stretching device allowing analyzes through the edge and the face, and designed so as to be adapted on the beamline. Different types of nanocomposites were studied :</p><p>on the one hand PLA nanocomposites filled with different clays. Seven types of clays treated with different kinds or no surfactants (Cloisite30B, Cloisite20A... Montmorillonite...) were used. These fillers are composed of a stacking of clay platelets between which is located the surfactant having different nature and chain lengths. The materials were elaborated using a melt-extrusion process. -On the other hand, PLA nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes (CNT) were elaborated using a solution route. CNTs have been chosen as this type of filler has received an increasing interest due to specific properties such as electric conductivity and high stiffness.</p><p>This report describes the main results regarding the influence of the nature of the filler on the strain-induced structural evolution of the polymer matrix. A wide temperature range above the glass transition temperature of PLA (Tg ≈ 60°C) was investigated, the stretching rate being set at 0,01 s -1 as in our previous study for the sake of comparison <ref type="bibr">(Macromolecules, 2010, 43, 7228)</ref> The first part of this study was the characterization of the structure and morphology of the initial materials. The MAXS/WAXS analysis revealed that all the samples exhibit an intercalated morphology whatever the nature of the filler. Only the clay inter layer distance was modified depending on the nature of the filler. From a structural point of view the WAXS patterns have shown that filled or unfilled samples were initially amorphous. The observations of the sample structure through the face and width show that: -in the case of clay fillers, the tactoids were preferentially aligned along the sample thickness, i.e. all samples exhibit orthotropic symmetry (see fig1).</p><p>-in the case of carbon nanotubes filler, there was an isotropic distribution of the CNTs. Regarding the structural evolution of PLA nanocomposites upon stretching as a function of the draw conditions, several behaviors should be pointed out. First, for a draw temperature near Tg, i.e. Td = 65°C, we previously demonstrated that a disorder to order transition occured upon stretching for neat PLA, the ordered phase being a mesomorphic form. In this study we have shown that the filler has no impact on this straininduced structural evolution regarding the formation of a mesophase. Moreover, the amount of strain-induced mesophase is approximately the same as for neat PLA. Nevertheless, the mechanical behavior shows a reinforcement characteristic of the filler effect.. We have previously shown that there is a link between the nature of the strain-induced ordered phase and the chain dynamics. Thus, this insensitivity of the polymer matrix structural evolution to the presence of filler indicates that the clays or the carbon nanotubes do not significantly influence the polymer chains dynamics.</p><p>The second draw temperature in this study was Td = 75°C, i.e. a temperature for which strain-induced crystallization has been observed during drawing. It has appeared that the presence of the filler does not significantly influence the strain-induced structural evolution of PLA (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), as for the case Td = 65°C. The fact is that strain-induced crystallization is slightly promoted by the clay, probably due to the so-called shear amplification effect. The third draw temperature investigated in this study was Td = 90°C. In this case, a clear influence of the presence of the filler was put in evidence. Indeed, whatever the filler used, a sharp enhancement of the strain-induced crystallization kinetics is observed. This phenomenon start at the onset of the deformation for the nanocomposites, while it only starts at a strain ε ≈ 300% in the case of the neat matrix as seen on figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. This nucleating effect of clay has already been observed in the case of thermal quiescent crystallization but, to our knowledge, it has never been reported for strain-induced crystallization.</p><p>More surprisingly, a fine analysis of the WAXS patterns obtained at the beginning of the deformation, (an example is reported on figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) indicated that the strain-induced crystals grow with the chain axis normal to the draw direction. This is particularly unusual since the strain-induced crystals are generally oriented with the chain axis along the draw direction. This quite fast increase of crystallinity for Td = 90°C suggests that the nucleating effect of clays combines with the shear amplification effect during drawing. Further work is necessary to progress in the understanding of this process.</p><p>An other goal of this study was to asses the potential occurrence of a "strain-induced exfoliation mechanism". Indeed there are some disparities in the literature regarding to this subject, and knowing the implications that it can have from both fundamental and applied point of view, the latter has to be assessed. In this aim the Middle Angle Scattering region was meticulously analyzed, as it is the region of clay scattering. Indeed, it is expected that if such a mechanism occurs during drawing one may observe a change in the position, shape or intensity of the diffraction peaks. Surprisingly, no changes in the diffraction peaks are observed even in terms of position than in terms of shape. Quantitative exploitation of the intensity has revealed to be very delicate due to the samples orthotropy. This behavior can be reasonably explained considering that there is little affinity between filler and matrix, as revealed by the WAXS study. Nevertheless, to go further, SAXS experiments on polymer nanocomposite systems having It has been shown that the evolution of the filler orientation was almost the same whatever its nature, but was strongly sensitive to the temperature. Furthermore these data will constitute a precious database for a recent collaboration dealing with the simulation of the mechanical behavior of PLA/nanocomposites.</p><p>During this session two concomitant topics were also addressed. One the one hand an attention has been paid to the influence of physical aging on the mechanical behavior of PLA above its glass transition temperature. Indeed, physical aging, which is a phenomenon occurring below Tg, is generally erased when the material is heated above Tg. But it has been recently shown that in the case of PLA a memory of thermal history is kept above Tg as judged from the influence on the crystallization behavior of the material. To explain the latter it has been postulated that some ordered domains are generated during the aging process, but this need further confirmation. Then, we have investigated the strain-induced structural evolution of aged and unaged PLA stretched above Tg. We have shown that both mechanical behavior and structural evolution are significantly influenced by the aging process. More precisely, aged PLA exhibits faster crystallization kinetics as can be seen on figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, and concomitant stronger strain-hardening. This is an indirect evidence of the formation of ordered domains during aging, which are preserved at temperatures above Tg, and which plays the role of nucleating agents..</p><p>The effect of the D-isomer content on the strain-induced structural evolution has been studied. Although it has been shown by some authors that this parameter has a strong influence on the thermal crystallization behavior of polylactide, there are no studies dealing with the effect of the D-isomer content on the strain-induced structural evolution. Samples covering a wide range of D-isomer contents (from 2% to 50%) have been studied and it has been shown that (see fig6):</p><p>as for thermal crystallization, it exists a critical D-isomer content above which no crystallization is possible. -Contrary to the case of thermal crystallization, the kinetics of strain-induced crystallization is not sensitive to the D-isomer content for the samples able to crystallize. This means that chain orientation governs the process. -Only the samples able to crystallize are able to form a mesomorphic phase when stretched near Tg, demonstrating that the PLA mesophase is a precursor of the crystalline phase. The results obtained are of prime interest from a fundamental point of view in order to better understand the complex physical behaviors of PLA. Moreover all these results constitute a valuable feedback for the elaboration of tunable PLA/nanocomposites</p><p>To conclude, the allocated beamtime has provided precious information regarding the structural evolution of PLA nanocomposites. Moreover, it has allowed us to test a homemade stretching device which has revealed to be perfectly adequate for our scientific approach.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig1:</head><figDesc>Fig1: (a) Flat-on &amp; (b) Edge-on WAXS patterns of PLA/C30B samples</figDesc><graphic coords="3,330.00,250.56,198.48,192.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
