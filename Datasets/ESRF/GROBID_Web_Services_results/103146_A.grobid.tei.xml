<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the proposed combined experiment at ID11 and ID18, was to apply methods of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Moessbauer spectroscopy in laser-heated diamond anvil cells (DACs) in order to reveal a role of iron oxides as structural prototypes for high-pressure silicates. A growing body of evidence suggests that a majority of lower mantle and some of transition zone minerals have structural analogs among iron oxides which form at much milder conditions. On the other hand, the amount of recently discovered iron oxides outnumbers their silicate counterparts. Therefore the objective of the current experiment was to synthesize novel iron silicates isostructural to novel iron oxides, and to characterize their crystal structure and compressional behavior.</p><p>We have investigated the reactivity between iron oxides (Fe3O4, Fe2O3) with quartz (SiO2) at pressures ranging from 20 to 150 GPa and temperatures up to 3000 K. Where it was possible we refined Fe,Si-atomic occupancies and determined approximate Fe/Si ratios in the structures. Our preliminary findings suggest that between 30 and 150 GPa no iron silicates can be synthesized by the reaction between simple oxides. Above 50 GPa, we detected only minor incorporation of Si into the crystal structure of the high-pressure polymorph of Fe3O4 (sp. gr. Bbmm).</p><p>Structural refinement, based on single-crystal XRD data, indicates that silicon fills the octahedral position with an occupancy of 5-10%, which approaches the detection limit for XRD methods.</p><p>On the other hand, we have detected a reaction between Fe2O3 and SiO2 at 20 GPa, resulting in the formation of a novel phase with the composition Fe1.5Si2O6 that adopts a structural type of clinoenstatite. The structure, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (left), is similar to Fe2Si2O6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, right), which was previously described by <ref type="bibr">Pakhomova et al. (Am. Miner., 102, 666, 2017)</ref>. The crystal structure of Fe2Si2O6 features two octahedral sites, each occupied by Fe 2+ cations. In contrast, Fe1.5Si2O6 has one octahedral site occupied by Fe 3+ and one 8-fold coordinated site that is filled by only half of Fe 2+ cation. Compared to Fe2Si2O6, Fe1.5Si2O6 has a 2.6% larger unit cell volume.  <ref type="bibr">Miner., 102, 666, 2017)</ref>. The crystal structures consist of corner-sharing SiO4-tetrahedral (brown) chains. In Fe2Si2O6, there are two distinct octahedral sites occupied by Fe 2+ cations (blue octahedra). However, in Fe1.5Si2O6 one octahedral site is occupied by Fe 3+ (green); Fe 2+ has an 8-fold coordination and occupies the position by only ½.</p><p>Our preliminary results indicate that reactions between pure iron oxides and silica are hindered above 30 GPa. However, studies on shock-induced minerals suggest that the formation of iron silicates with structures of complex iron oxides is plausible at extreme conditions. The mineral silicate elgoresite, (Mg,Fe)5Si2O9, found in the Suizhou L6 chondrite, contains Si in presence of Mg. Therefore, in our next experiments, we aim to investigate the influence of Mg on the solubility of Si in iron oxides.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>, FB 11, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt</figDesc></figure>
