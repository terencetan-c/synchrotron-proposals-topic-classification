<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The series of phase transitions in the dominant upper mantle constituent Mg 1.9 Fe 0.1 SiO 4 [olivine αphase] to its high-pressure polymorphs wadsleyite <ref type="bibr">[β-phase]</ref> and ringwoodite [γ-phase] play an essential role for large scale geodynamical processes in the Earth's mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ringwood and Major, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Weidner and Wang, 2000)</ref>. Several features in geophysical observations remain difficult to explain, including seismic anomalies at transition zone depth, where these transformations take place and the diversity of slabs subduction behaviors which either stagnate in the transition zone or penetrate directly into the lower mantle. In order to assess the effects of phase transformations on the rheological properties of the slab material and to build reliable models of mantle flow and slab subduction behaviors, a detailed understanding of the microstructure development, underlying transformation mechanism and transformation kinetics is needed (i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Nakagawa et al., 2009)</ref>. However, few, mostly ex situ studies have been dedicated to these topics because of the manifold technical and analytical challenges to overcome. Indeed, this type of studies require the combination of advanced 3D-XRD and optimized high-pressure high temperature diamond anvil cells techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical Part:</head><p>During the allocated beam time at the ESRF beamline ID27, we successfully conducted simultaneous high pressure and temperature (high PT) three dimensional-X-ray diffraction (3D-XRD) experiments up to 32 GPa and 1150 K and collected X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns during the series of phase transitions from the α-phase to the β-phase and from the β-phase to the γ-phase. A polycrystalline sample with a hydrous Mg-end member olivine composition (Mg 2 SiO 4 ) with ~500 ppm H 2 O synthesized at ETH Zürich served as a starting material. The X-ray beam characteristics at the ESRF beamline ID27 consisted of a 7 (H) x 4(V) μm 2 focused monochromatic X-ray beam tuned to a wavelength of 0.3738 Å. XRD patterns were collected using a PerkinElmer detector with an active area of 2048 x 2048 pixels of 200 μm located at a distance of 457 mm from the sample. A LaB 6 standard was measured at the beginning of the experiment in order to obtain precise calibration parameters of the beam center position, sample to detector distance and detector tilts.</p><p>Three high PT assemblies were prepared during the allocated beam time using the setup detailed in the report (HS-4765) with additional improvements (as proposed in the previous report HS-4765), including a modified resistive heating DAC with K-type thermocouples, a larger vacuum vessel, more stable power supplies, a remote temperature controller, and thinner cylindrical graphite heaters of 0.5 mm thickness. In all experiments the sample was loaded without pressure transmitting medium, together with gold and NaCl for pressure-temperature determination the using cross calibration method. The gold and NaCl standards were positioned at the edge of the sample chamber in order to avoid diffraction peak overlapping. This modified setup was very well adapted for the long duration of 3D-XRD experiments during the succession of the high PT phase transformations in Mg 2 SiO 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>3D-XRD images were collected at ambient conditions and at low pressures (4 GPa) to precisely determine and track the initial micromechanical properties of olivine. The sample was then stepwise heated up to 1150 K in 100 ° increments with a rate of 15 ° /min. Upon heating the pressure in the sample increased without further additional compression due to the thermal expansion of the gas in the DAC membrane and thinning of the metallic gasket due to enhanced plastic flow at the high-temperatures. In the later stages of the experiments when the pressure stabilized the temperature was further increased up to 1250 K (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Upon compression and heating 3D-XRD images were collected at each PT step to monitor the micromechanical properties of the transforming material. A total of three runs has been performed and 100 PT points were sampled up 32 GPa and 1250 K (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Among them, we could observe the α-β transformation in two experiments and in one of these experiments the sample could be further transformed from the β-phase to the γ-phase.</p><p>Data processing is currently in progress using single-grain analysis technique and the 3D-XRD software FABLE (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Nisr et al., 2012)</ref>. The collected diffraction images are of excellent quality for 3D-XRD studies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) and will therefore allow extracting various information from individual grains inside the polycrystalline sample (crystallographic parameters, orientations and growth rates). This analysis allows drawing conclusions on the entire sample properties (grain transformation kinetics, evolution of the grain size distributions, texture relations between parent and newly formed phase, etc.) and on the underlying phase transformation mechanisms. The new dataset will not only allow drawing a more complete picture of phase transitions in the most abundant minerals in the Earth upper mantle but will certainly shed new light on the origin of seismic anisotropies in the vicinity of deep slabs.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Pressure and temperature path ways followed during 6 different experimental runs performed during the allocated beamtime of ES-98 (colored symbols) and HS-4765 (grey symbols) plotted in the PT diagram of Mg2SiO4. Each color corresponds to a different run. The regime of slab geotherms is presented as grey shaded area while the stability fields of phases in the Mg2SiO4 system are separated by solid black lines. Squares represent selected PT points were diffraction images for 3D XRD analysis were taken. In experiments performed at temperatures below 880 K (grey diamonds and triangles) metastable persistence of the  -phase up 30 GPa was observed. In an experiments performed at higher temperatures (grey squares) the direct transformation from the  -phase to the γphase could be observed at 930 K and above 18 GPa. The series of phase transformations from the -to the β-to the γ-could be monitored in a single experimental run (red squares) with increasing pressure and temperatures up to 32 GPa and 1250 K.  <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Diffraction lines and Miller indices corresponding to a certain phase are indicated in black for the phase, in green for the β -phase and in red for the γ-phase. In a) the pure -phase is stable showing a spotty diffracting signal. In b) the sample transformed partly to the β-phase and γ-phase, while in c) the sample completely transformed to the -phase. In d) the γ-phase persist meta stable even though the equilibrium boundary is overstepped by more than 5 GPa. We did not observe the decomposition of the γ-phase to periclase and perovskite which might be due to the sluggish transformation kinetics. At these high pressures conditions (32 GPa) the diffraction lines of the γphase show a significant modulation most likely due to deviatoric stress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
