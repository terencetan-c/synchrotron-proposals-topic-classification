<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Combined nanoscale strain and halide composition mapping in perovskite layers deposited on silicon for tandem solar cells flat Si substrates and pyramid textured Si as described in the proposal. Pristine thin layers were studied, obtained through different deposition processes and conditions. Samples obtained by spin-coating were investigated: two of them were deposited on flat Si substrates, each being annealed for a different time (5 min or 1h at 100 ºC), to investigate the effect of the annealing on the strain, grain orientation, halide distribution as well as the distribution of PbI2.. This crystalline compound is known to have to different origins: untransformed precursor or degradation product of the perovskite. Additionaly, perovskite thin films were also deposited on textured Si substrates by two different techniques, spin coating and slot die coating. The former is the most widely used technique in laboratory but it leads to non-uniform layers when aiming for the large area deposition required for industrial applications. The latter allows rapid and well-controlled large area deposition. Finally, cross-sections of a solar cell based on a perovskite layer spin coated on flat silicon was prepared for depth-resolved investigations. The experiment being held 3 month ago, the data is still under investigation. We present here the first results extracted.</p><p>1. Experimental set-up and raw data During the experiment, nano-scanning XRD and XRF were simultaneously measured, with the aim of mapping both structural and chemical information on our samples. In terms of chemical information, we particularly focus on halide distribution. The experiment was conducted at an energy of 15.2 keV. A beam of around 70 nm in size was used and the flux was estimated at 4.5 10 10 ph/s. The raw data for XRD, measured with the Eiger 4M detector and XRF, measured with the Vortex-EM detector are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The grain size was measured by SEM to a few hundreds of nanometers, the focused nano-beam allowed to image individual grains, as shown by the sarcity of the spots on the Eiger image. 2. On the beam induced damage of HHP Extensive efforts have been dedicated during the experiment to investigate the beam induced degradation of HHP. First of all, setting the energy to 15.2 keV in comparison to the 13 keV used for preliminary tests not only allowed for the measurement of the fluorescence of the Br but also was observed to decrease the beam induced damage. Moreover, various measurement conditions were tested to optimize the measurement methodology in order to minimize beam damage and allow for the obtention of reliable data. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the effect of the repetition of mapping, with two different steps keeping constant the counting time. The first parameter investigated was the nature of the scan. On ID13, 2 different mapping modes are available: meshes and raster scans. During the former, the shutter is closed between each measurement point. During the latter, the shutter remains open as a line of the map is measured, it is then closed while the translation motors move the sample to the starting point of the next line: once there, the shutter is opened again for the measurement of this line. No real difference between these two types of measurements was observed, and since the raster scans are a lot faster than the meshes, we opted for raster scanning the sample. The more stricking influence found was on the step size taken between each measurement point of a map. Three different step sizes were tested: 50 nm, 100 nm and 200nm. The evolution of the distribution of both the I and the Br in function of the repeated scans is showed in figure Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. For sake of reliability of the measured data, 200 nm step has to be preferred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Grain orientation and lattice parameter</head><p>As explained in the first paragraph of this report, few diffraction spots were observed on each measurement point. This allows to extract the orientation of individual grains in the mapped region.</p><p>An example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.a). The maps represented in this figure were measured on a HHP layer deposited on a flat Si substrate.</p><p>It shows that for most of the grains imaged here, multiple measurement points are taken, allowing eventually to map the inhomogeneities at the grain level. Further data processing is in progress.</p><p>For each grain, the lattice parameter can be calculated. An example is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.b) where the grain oriented along the HHP [100] direction (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>.a) is studied. The lattice parameter is represented next to the peak intensity. The lattice parameter was calculated for measurement points showing at least 10 % of the maximum intensity measured on the (100) peak in this grain. The result shows a large inhomogeneity in lattice parameter inside an individual grain. However these are only preliminary results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Localizing the pyramids on textured Si substrates</head><p>As explained in the introduction of the report and in the proposal, one of our aims is to investigate HHP layers deposited on silicon wafers with micron scale pyramid-textured surface, and more precisely the influence of the pyramids on the perovskite microstructure. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows an example of Pb XRF maps which gives access to the localization of the pyramids; this was confirmed by comparing to transmission maps (transmission is minimum for maximum Pb XRF intensity) and to similar measurements performed on perovskite layers deposited on flat silicon, which do not show any micron scale intensity variation (not shown here).</p><p>The XRF maps will then be compared to the lattice parameter and orientation maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>Cross-section samples for depth resolved studies   of the set up is shown in 5.c). After identifying the regions of interest thanks to the on-axis microscope of ID13, the sample was carefully aligned with the X-ray beam based on the fluorescence and transmission intensities.</p><p>Raster scans were performed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>.d-g) shows Br and I XRF maps as well as mapping of the intensity of the perovskite (100) and PbI2 (002) diffraction peaks obtained from the radial integration of the Eiger images.</p><p>Unfortunately, the preparation process appeared to be quite destructive for the perovskite as evidenced in figure 5-f. However, these first cross-section investigations allowed us to develop methodologies for the sample alignment, as well as for XRF and XRD measurements. Our laboratory will soon be equipped with a femtosecond laser which has been shown to be a quite efficient cutting technique for HHP. We also hope to soon be able to carry out cross-section measurements in better conditions. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>experiment was performed in June 2023 in two individual sessions: from 17/06/2023 to 19/06/2023 and from 27/06/2023 to 29/06/2023.
