The goal in collecting these data is to investigate the evolution of physiology and tooth replacement patterns around the origins of mammals. We were able to scan the following species in our experiment: Massetognathus, Diademodon, Trirachodon, Procynosuchus, and Scalenodontoides. Together, these species bracket the early and late evolution of gomphodonts, which represent an independent origin of herbivory with complex dental occlusion along the line leading to mammals.</p><p>The experiment was complicated by the COVID-19 lockdowns in South Africa and France. We were able to ship the specimens to France via Kudakwashe Jakata, who left employment at the University of the Witwatersrand to take up a postdoctoral fellowship at the ESRF. Scanning was done over several sessions when lockdown regulations would allow by Paul Tafforeau and Kudakwashe Jakata, and monitored remotely by Jonah Choiniere and Roger Benson. Imaging the specimens was complicated in part by the high resolutions required (1-5 microns), by the large size of the samples (up to 15cm-long skulls with teeth embedded in rock matrix as well as within the tooth row of the skulls), and by the complexity of locating the positions of serial teeth within a skull with small focal areas. However, the preliminary results were promising and suggest that we obtained useable data.</p><p>We took receipt of fully reconstructed data in early 2021. These data were intended to form the basis of the postdoctoral fellowship of Elsa Panciroli, but COVID-related issues in the timing of the experiment and the nature of the fellowship indicate that Jonah Choiniere and Roger Benson will conduct the research on the experimental data separately.</p><p>Analysis of the data has not yet started. We anticipate a start date of October, 2021, with no predictable date for publication of our findings.</p></div>			</div>
