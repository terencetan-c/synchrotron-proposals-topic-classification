<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was using a new methodology for real-time in situ monitoring of reaction induced by mechanical milling (mechanochemical reactions). The following three important aspects of mechanochemical processing of drugs were addressed: 1) distribution of reactivity and transformations across the milling vessel; 2) reversibility and equilibration of polymorphic forms during milling and 3) mechanochemical, solvent-free synthesis of APIs as a highly attractive new opportunity for pharmaceutical development. We directly monitored the cocrystallization reactions of selected APIs in particular areas of the milling jar that are dominated by different types of mechanical action. This lead to the first mapping of the distribution of mechanical reactivity across the milling vessel. The second aim of the proposed research was to in situ follow the stages of a stepwise milling transformation, in cases when the accumulation of the product was not monotonic with the time of treatment, but went through an extremum (the phase transition in sulphatiazole, the reactions of co-crystallization involving amino acids and carboxylic acids. The third aim of proposed work was the real-time and in situ observation of the mechanochemical synthesis of APIs. Experiments included monitoring transformations at systematically varied intensity of treatment, on variable composition of the mixtures if reactants. We have followed the effects of adding inert components on the reaction outcome. The data are being processed and prepared for publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Amorphization and phase transitions by milling</head><p>The available time at the ESRF has enabled us to systematically examine the amoprhization behavior and reactivity of simple organic molecules in the solid state, primarily imidazoles and carbohydrates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Imidazole substrates</head><p>For imidazoles, our study systematically explored the effect of substituent choice and position on the solid-state behavior of ca. 15 different imidazoles. Preliminary screening revealed the absence of amorphization or other types of phase transitions under conventional screening conditions (30 min milling in a 14 mL Perspex milling jar, 300 mg sample, 10 mm diameter stainless steel ball of 3.9 grams weight, corresponding to m milling media /m sample ratio of 13) for all explored imidazoles except 4-nitroimidazole, 5chloroimidazole, 2-iodo and 2-isopropylimidazole. While milling of 4-nitroimidazole and 5chlorobenzimidazole revealed mechanochemical amorphization, the 2-iodo and 2-isopropylimidazoles underwent polymorphic transformations. These model systems enabled a unique opportunity to directly explore, for the first time, the effect of conventional mechanochemical parameters, such as milling frequency, ratio of the weight of milling media to the weight of sample, and the choice of milling media, on the course of a mechanochemically-induced phase transition. The most complete set of results, with duplicate measurements that attest to reproducibility, has been obtained for the phase transformation of 2isopropylimidazole. It was clearly established that phase transition is dependent on the milling frequency, as well as on the size of utilized milling media. Surprisingly, phase transition was readily induced by milling media of 10 mm diameter or higher (3.9 grams or more weight), but not by smaller miling media, even if their total weight exceeded 4 grams. Crystal structure determination of the new polymorphs of 2-iodo-and 2isopropylimidazole, made by milling, are underway and we except that the first publication arising from this work will be submitted by October. It is important to stress that these measurements are first examples of direct evaluation of the effect of well-known parameters of mechanochemistry on kinetics of structural transformations and should be publishable in a high-impact journal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Carbohydrates</head><p>In the context of carbohydrates, we have observed and systematically investigated the parameters behind mechanochemical amorphization of sucrose. This data will serve as preliminary results for a more extensive and systematic study of mechanochemical amorphization of sugars, of interest to industries in pharmaceutical and food industries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Assembly of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)</head><p>We have also explored the mechanochemical transformations of MOFs. In particular, our intention was to provide the first in situ data for the mechanochemical assembly of a cadmium-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). Besides establishing the mechanism of the salt-catalyzed formation of a known close-packed ZIF structure, we have also discovered a rare and potentially unique example of such a closepacked structure being transformed into a previously not known open framework through reaction with excess templating ligand. To the best of our knowledge, such close packedopen framework transformation has never previously been observed in mechanochemical transformation. We are currently following up these results with a systematic solid-state NMR study and expect the publication for a high-impact journal to be ready by October. Importantly, we were already able to establish the crystal structure of the new open framework product from powder X-ray diffraction data, which revealed another surprisea noninterpenetrated diamondoid topology which is encountered very rarely in MOF chemistry, providing further importance to this unexpected transformation discovered at the ESRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Mechanisms and Kinetics of Organic Mechanochemistry</head><p>With current knowledge of the complexities that underpin mechanochemical reactions, the limitations imposed by stop-start and ex situ analytical methodologies have the potential to greatly skew the results of mechanistic and kinetic investigation of mechanochemical processes. The time provided at the ESRF allowed novel insights into mechanochemistry and its mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Mechanisms of Organic Co-Crystallisation</head><p>Work on the glycine + oxalic acid dihydrate system focused on exploration of the mechanisms through which it forms the known salts glycinium oxalate (GO) and bis(glycinium) oxalate (G 2 O). Ex situ kinetics of the cocrystallisation from the reactive components, suggested G 2 O to be an intermediate to GO formation. Further, this original work demonstrated the ability to select the final salt product through selection of input reactant stoichiometries. With the capabilities of synchrotron radiation, this system was studied further. In particular, in situ investigations were two-pronged: (1) understanding how GO and G 2 O salt formation occurs, and (2) obtaining insights into parameter effects on mechanochemical reactions. This work offered unprecedented temporal precision of the salt formation, disproving the current understanding of the process. Combined with similar studies varying reactant particle size, these studies offer the first indication that many of the conventional controls that govern solution crystallisation may not be equally important for mechanochemical crystallisation. In particular, these data suggest that particle mixing is considerably more important for determining the final state of a mechanochemical process than the thermodynamics of the system as a whole. Such results are of paramount importance academically and industrially, showing that current controls over mechanochemical product formationin particular for pure, fine chemicalsremain far from being understood. This system offered further opportunity to investigate the well-known crystal-growing concept of seeding. These studies reinforce the concept that within a mechanochemical milling jar, the system is not subjected to system-wide thermodynamic controls, but is instead controlled by conditions at the impact point. The practical and fundamental results of these studies are of critical importance to all who use mechanochemical techniques in academic and industrial applications. These results are therefore publishable in a high-impact factor journal and a publication is currently in preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Excipients in Mechanochemical Co-Crystallisation</head><p>Studying the in situ real time milling of simple organic systems, the role of excipients (a common additive in the pharmaceutical industry) could be explored. In particular the benefits and dangers of their addition were explored on the mechanochemical co-crystallisation. Depending on the nature of the co-crystallisation, excipient addition was found to either enhance or inhibit to process. In doing so, these studies not only shed practical light onto the development of novel methodologies to conduct difficult mechanochemistry, but offered fundamental insights into highly disputed mechanisms of these processes. This is the first exploration of excipient effects on the mechanisms of mechanically induced multi-component crystallisation and is of importance to both academic and industrial communities across the discipline. As such these results are publishable in a high impact factor journal and are currently under preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Comparing Mechanical Stability of Polymorphs</head><p>Systematic investigations were performed to compare the mechanical stability of the two anhydrous polymorphs of caffeine. Particular focus was paid to the effects of key mechanochemical parameters: milling frequency and milling ball mass. A change in milling body mass was shown to have drastic consequences on the stability of each polymorph, reducing stability from nearly one hour to seconds. This is a surprisingly nonlinear dependence, suggesting a more complex interplay of energy transfer than previously believed. Such investigations made possible at the ESRF pave the way for fundamental advances in our understanding of the physics of mechanochemical processes. In depth kinetic analyses are currently underway alongside detailed thermodynamic investigations to probe deeper into a comparison of relative polymorph stabilities. This is the first example in which the mechanical stability of two polymorphs with the same mechanically induced product has been studied in such detail. We believe these results are of high fundamental importance, systematically exploring the basic mechanochemical parameters of ball mass and milling frequency, as well as the fundamental relationship between polymorphs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="4,112.10,605.65,371.00,172.90" type="bitmap" /></figure>
