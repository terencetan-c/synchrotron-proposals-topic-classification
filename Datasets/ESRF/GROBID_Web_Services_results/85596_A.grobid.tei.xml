<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The investigation focused on the possibility to investigate the in-situ solid/liquid transformations in Al-based Al-Sn Phase Change Alloys (PCA) for Thermal Energy Storage (TES). In PCA, the heat storage/release during heating/cooling cycles occurs by means of active phase transformations and it is affected by microstructural features, properties, composition and morphology of phases as induced by the manufacturing route of the material. The investigated alloys were produced by simple mixing (SM) or ball-milling (BM) powders of the two elements or by means of combined SM and BM, followed by compression and sintering processes. Their microstructures, different from those of conventional casting processes, were promising for PCA as far as the overall material form-stability and molten phase leakage are concerned. Thus, a series of heat cycles simulating service across the melting temperature of Sn phase (232°C) was performed on different alloys in a furnace developed at ESRF-ID19. Specifically, isochronal heating from RT to 300°C, followed by cooling at the same heating rate was performed. In some cases, the sintering heat treatment at temperature exceeding 500°C was simulated. During each test, high resolution (HR) micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans of the specimen were performed in heating and cooling at specific temperatures with 180° sample rotation. The micro-CT reconstructions were prepared by ESRF team, that supplied for each specimen/temperature a set of 2048 slices for further analyses. The analyses are still under completion, but some of the main results can be here mentioned.</p><p>1) A clear correspondence between the micro-CT scans and SEM analyses at the same magnification can be observed, specifically in samples where homogeneous Sn phase was greater than 10 microns (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). This correspondence is useful for image analyses and comparison to previous SEM analyses. The same holds for finer microstructures, obtained from ball milling, where the Al and Sn content was only identifiable by phase brigthness (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). 2) The tomographic analyses were suitable for the detection of Sn movement inside the samples, which also included different degrees of initial porosity. For example, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the trend for Sn and pore percentage as function of temperature during the thermal cycle, for a sample produced though simple mixing of powders, hot compression at 220°C and sintering at 500°C. 3) In certain samples, the formation of small surface droplets on the external surface of the samples was also detected due to the accurate surface positioning within the volume of analyses (see Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). 100 µm 100 µm 100 µm Sn droplet on sample surface</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Tomography slices of Al-Sn PCAs characterized by coarse microstructure obtained through simple mixing (a), by fine structure obtained through ball-milling (b), and formation of droplets on the surface of the samples heated above the melting temperature of the Sn phase (c).
