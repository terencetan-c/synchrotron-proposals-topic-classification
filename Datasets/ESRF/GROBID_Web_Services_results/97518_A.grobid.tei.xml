Previous results indicate that REE adsorbed onto schwertmannite surface from covalent bonding with Fe in a bidentate coordination. However, the uncertain of EXAFS models indicated that other possible coordination, such as monodentate, cannot be ruled out (Lozano et al., 2019). REE desorption experiments carried out in our lab show that REE desorption is highly dependent of pH (Fig 1) where light REE are easily desorbed in comparison with heavy REE.</p><p>The equilibrium constants calculated for this desorption reactions indicated that heavy and light REE are released from bidentate (n = 2) and monodentate (n = 1) complexes, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>). The working hypothesis used for this experiment was that both adsorption coordination was present on REE adsorbed onto the schwertmannite surface where monodentate proportion increase toward light REE. This hypothesis could explain the higher desorption rate in light REE with respect to heave REE with a coordination number close to 1. To prove this hypothesis, we proposed an X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiment at BM30 in schwertmannite samples loaded with La, Gd and Lu, before and after desorption experiments run at different pH (3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5).</p><p>The experiment was performed with an incident energy en the range of 5420 to 5880 eV for La L3-edge, 7200 eV for Gd L3-edge and 9100 to 9880 eV for Lu L3-edge. The fist day of beamtime was devoted to the beamline alignment and the acquisition of XANES in La, Gd and Lu reference solids in order to calibrate the detector and optimize the acquisition of the emission lines analyzed in these experiments. Samples were in a He cryostat to reduce the thermal vibration. During the rest of the experiment, schwertmannite samples with La and Gd and Lu before and after desorption experiment, were measured:</p></div>

The La concentration in this sample was in the order of 5 g kg -1 and it was the most concentrate sample. However, the normalization and result interpretation of the EXAFS spectra was not possible due to poor signal. The low photon flow around 7 keV in BM30 and the low La concentration in this sample prevented the acquisition of a good EXAFS spectra, event when many scans were run. The rest of La samples were not run in this experiment due to their concentration in La was lower that the display sample in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. 1.00E-02 1.20E-02 1.40E-02 1.60E-02 1.80E-02 2.00E-02 2.20E-02 2.40E-02 2.60E-02 2.80E-02 3.00E-02 5400 5450 5500 5550 5600 5650 5700 xµ(E) Energy (eV) La L3-edge (5483 eV)</p><p>Schwertmannite with Gd.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> display the EXAFS spectra obtained in the schwertmannite sample loaded with Gd before the desorption experiment. As in the precious case, this sample contain the highest Gd concentration (around 3.5 g kg -1 ). In this case, the Gd emission line analyzed was very close to Fe K-edge. Due to the matrix is a Fe-oxyhydroxide, the high Fe adsorption overlap the Gd signal, bringing a spectrum which could not be interpreted. Other Gd absorption lines (i.e., L1 and L2) were also tested, however the low Gd concentration brings a poor signal in those lines and, finally, we desisted to measure the schwertmannite samples loaded with Gd. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Schwertmannite with Lu.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> display the EXAFS spectra obtained in schwertmannite sample before and after desorption experiment at pH 4.5. For this group of samples, we obtained a good signal in Lu L3-edge and background subtraction was performed. The preliminary interpretation of EXAFS data display that Lu coordination on schwertmannite after adsorption fits with a bidentate binuclear binding mechanism according to the models runs using Artemis software. This result is in agreement with previous experiments <ref type="bibr">(Lozano et al., 2019)</ref>. However, the samples after desorption at any pH fit with a monodentate coordination model, where Lu form just one covalent bind with schwertmannite surface (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>):</p><p>7000 7100 7200 7300 7400 7500 7600 7700 Nor. xµ(E) Energy (eV) Fe K-edge (7112 eV) 7200 7220 7240 7260 7280 7300 Nor. xµ(E) Energy (eV) La L3-edge (7243 eV) 0 2 4 6 8 χ(R) A -4 (a.u.)

However, the analytical problems with La and Gd prevent us to conclude the desorption reaction and the effect of pH in retention mechanism depending on the REE analyzed. Lanthanum and Gd samples should be run a beamline equipped with High-Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected (HERFD) that can discriminate the signal from Fe K-edge and Gd L3-edge and detect elements in a very low concentration. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a) Experimental desorbed RE fraction from schwertmannite as a function of pH; b) n index of the surface complexation reaction obtained from the slope values of the linear regressions as function of the RE ionic radius (Å)</figDesc><graphic coords="3,39.40,101.24,519.71,252.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
