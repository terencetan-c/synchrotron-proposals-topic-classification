<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Set up of the home equipment (gas manifold, cell, mass spectrometer, gas lines, switch valves; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and alignment of the beamline lasted 1 day. The experimental setup is esentially identical to that used previously in various beamtimes (for example see beamtime MA-3145 and report). The aim of the experiment was to analyze potential three-way catalysts (TWC) based on perovskite-type oxides substituted with Cu under the pulsed experimental conditions that are typical of their operation. The possibile structural changes occurring during reaction were followed using hihg energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD). We have used the new Pilatus detector available at ID15 that allowed to follow in a time-resolved manner these structural changes over short pulses of reactants (20-30 s). HEXRD data where collected continuously (0.5 s/pattern; Q= 0-12 Å -1 ; 74.9 keV) while the samples were heated to 450°C and then cooled in the reaction feed consisting of 0.7 vol% CO, 0.15 vol% NO, 0.16 vol% C 3 H 6 and oscillating O 2 concentration values (1-0.7 vol%, 30 s) after treatment at 400°C in 5 vol% O 2 for 30 min. A dedicated homemade flow reactor cell equipped with two graphite windows and allowing fast switching was used throughout. The exhaust of the cell was monitored online using a mass spectrometer (MS). XRD shows that 20 wt% Cu II O/La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 initially comprises of Cu II O deposited on La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 . In the temperature programmed ramp in the continuous feed simulating stoichiometric conditions no substantial NO reduction activity was observed. Only CO could be converted to some extent. The operando XRD data did not show any substantial structural change under these conditions. In marked contrast, the temperature ramp under oscillating feed simulatinge short shifts to rich conditions exhibited variations of both catalytic activity and catalyst structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Beside full CO conversion, the mean NO conversion attained close to 90% in the heating segment. In the cooling segment, NO reduction extended down to ca. 300°C. The hysteresis of NO conversion was provided by structural changes. XRD demonstrated that the doublet of Cu II O disappeared in favor of Cu I O above 340°C, which further reduced to metallic Cu at ca. 440°C that persisted in the plateau of maximum NO conversion. In the cooling segment, where NO reduction activity persisted for longer time, Cu 0 oxidized to Cu I O but reoxidation to Cu II O was not observed until 100°C. During the transformation of the Cu component, La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 also displayed reduction. First, the intense reflection at 2.3 Å -1 shifted to lower angles due to loss of O and lattice expansion. At ca. 350°C the perovskite phase changed into a parent oxygen deficient brownmillerite phase simultaneous to the Cu II O→Cu I O transformation. The La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 phase was restored in the cooling segment below 300°C. An identical experiment on a 6 wt% CuO/La 2 O 3 catalyst showed no Cu II O reduction and poor activity suggesting that the combination of Cu II O and the perovskite is essential for the observed changes. Moreover, this also indicates that the reversible reduction of the perovskite phase is needed to induce catalytic activity. Additionally, an experiment on Cu II O/La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 in absence of C 3 H 6 clearly demonstrated that C 3 H 6 reforming to produce H 2 is the reaction pathway responsible for NO reduction under the oscillating feed. Extensive data evaluation of both HEXRD and MS datasets is on-going. Dr. M. Di Michiel and the team of ID15 are greatly acknowledged for their support during the allocated beamtime.
