<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The properties of SiC applied as a substrate for III-N compound epitaxy allow to utilize it for high-power devices, working in high-temperature and resistant to the action of the electromagnetic field. This is the source of great interest in an epitaxial growth of Al(Ga)N/GaN/In(Ga)N heterostructures on both 4H and 6H SiC substrates. The problem consists in finding the appropriate buffer layers to grown good quality Al(Ga)N/GaN/In(Ga)N heterostructures. The objective of the project was to work out the undestructive method of characterization of the above mentioned buffer layers and heterostructures based on X-ray diffraction. To this end the measured rocking and reflectometric curves were compared to the ones simulated by means of a computer program based on a Darwin version of X-ray diffraction theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Because of the small volume of the investigated III-N layers the synchrotron radiation proved to be necessary to properly determine the chemical composition and interplanar spacing profiles especially in the interface region of succeeding layers.</p><p>At the first stage of the experiment the rocking curves were collected at the vicinity of the 002 GaN reflection for Al(Ga)N/GaN heterostructures grown on 4H and 6H 001 SiC substrates by MOCVD technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The sample of such experimental and simulated rocking curves for heterostructure deposited on 6H SiC substrate are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The investigated heterostructures have been designed so that to enable the assessment of the influence of the substrate and buffer type, thickness of AlN layer and the level of the doping of the AlGaN layer on the their crystalline quality.</p><p>At the second stage of the experiment the strain was induced in 1μm thick GaN layer by means of the Ar ion implantation. It was found that strained layer was created within the GaN one, with lattice constant greater then that for GaN, and that the relative lattice misfit Δa/a between these two layers, measured in the growth direction as a function of implanted dose of Ar ions proved to be linear for doses less then 1.0E+15, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The increase of the implanted dose beyond that value does not bring about the increase of the lattice deformation in the growth direction. These results may be employed to accomplish the postgrowth engineering of the interface profiles in AlN/GaN/AlGaN hetrostrructures.  At the third stage of the experiment the study of the degree of crystalline and chemical perfection of AlN/GaN heterostructures consisting of ultra-thin GaN quantum wells (QWs) separated by AlN barriers, grown on the top of AlN buffer layers with thickness ranging from 100 nm to 220 nm have been investigated.</p><p>2 THETA [deg] 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31 30 log(INTENSITY) [a.u.] It has been found, that in the volume of GaN well, no relaxation occurred i.e. both AlN and GaN layers have the same in-plane lattice parameter as the underlying buffer layer. It means that GaN QWs are compressed to match the lattice constant of AlN. This means that applied buffer layers actually are effective substrates for the two-dimensional growth. The structure quality of AlN/GaN heterostructures have been confirmed by the satisfactory match between the measured and simulated diffraction and reflectometric profiles. The values of correlation length of columnar crystallites and the strain normal to the surface has been determined by applying the pseudo-Voit fit of 002 AlN and heterostructure reflections. The strain plotted versus correlation length normal to the surface turned out to be a monotonically decreasing function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
