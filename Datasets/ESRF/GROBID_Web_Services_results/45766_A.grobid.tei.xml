This procedure resulted in 50% reduction of the cumulated seizure duration compared to sham animals. This effect was significant as soon as 3 week after irradiation, and still constant after three months. As opposed to cortical irradiation, no beneficial effect was observed when the thalamus relay nuclei -also involved in the network underlying absence seizures -was bilaterally targeted using the same parameters.</p><p>As of today, it is unknown why irradiation of the cortical focus did not totally abolish absence seizures. The partial effect of the cortical irradiation raises the question of whether irradiated structures retain some epileptogenic properties. We propose to answer this question using intracellular recordings of neurons within the irradiated cortex in order to demonstrate whether the irradiated cells still display the characteristic hyperexcitability of the GAERS' neurons. These recording will be performed in collaboration with Stéphane Charpier (Centre de recherche du cerveau et de la moelle, CRICM, Paris). This team, with which we have been successfully collaborating in the past <ref type="bibr">(Polack et al., 2007)</ref>, is very familiar with the GAERS model and the functional characteristics of its cortical and thalamic neurons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>Using the IntMRT technique described in Serduc et al. ( <ref type="formula">2010</ref>), we targeted bilaterally the socalled "cortical focus" (200Gy), i.e. the somatosensory cortex (S1Cx), as well as two structures involved in the propagation and maintenance of SWDs, i.e. the motor cortex (MoCx) and the ventro-lateral thalamic nuclei (VLTN; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In each animal, we verified the correct targeting by T1-weighed magnetic resonance within the two weeks that followed IntMRT and examined their general behavior by standard tests to detect possible side effects.</p><p>During the 4 months following irradiation, we monitored weekly the seizures in freely moving animals by recording local-field potentials (LFPs) from depth electrodes implanted in the three target regions. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the antiepileptic effect by performing in vivo intracellular recordings of individual irradiated neurons of the S1Cx.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>MRI acquired 14 days after bilateral S1Cx, MoCx or VLTN (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) irradiations showed strong, sharply delimited, hypersignals in the regions where MBs interlaced, suggesting an alteration of the vascular integrity and micro-ruptures of the blood-brain barrier within the targets. These images denote a precise targeting and an effective sparing of tissue irradiated with non-interlaced MBs. In vivo intracellular recordings showed that irradiated pyramidal neurons were strongly hyperpolarized, displayed a decreased excitability and a reduction of spontaneous synaptic activities (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). As a result, irradiated cortical neurons were unable to oscillate in synchrony to initiate spike-wave discharges (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Fig. 4:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>These above-mentioned functional alterations explain the suppression of large-scale synchronization within irradiated cortical networks. However, the fact that seizures remained in the non-irradiated structures of the thalamocortical loop (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) indicates that the destruction of the cortical focus is not sufficient to totally abolish pathological oscllations.</p><p>We propose that other structures can indeed start seizures but with a lesser efficiency. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The bilateral delivery of 200 Gy in any of the three brain targets resulted in a near complete abolition of SWDs on the LFPs recorded from these structures (Fig 2). The average power in the 6-9 Hz frequency band was decreased by 93, 74 and 88% in the irradiated S1Cx, MoCx and VLTN, respectively, when compared to LFP signals recorded from homologous structures in non-irradiated animals (Fig 2).
