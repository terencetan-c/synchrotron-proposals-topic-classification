<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples investigated</head><p>Three types of samples were measured: a) Organic and inorganic Hg reference compounds with different types of ligands (S, O, Cl, I) and Hg coordinations (2, 3 and 4). b) Natural organic matter (NOM) standards from the International Humic Substances Society with exogenous Hg at added Hg concentration as low as 20 ppm, and also protein-rich fractions extracted in our laboratory by chromatographic separation methods. c) The organo-clay fractions (0.1-2.0 m) of a topsoil and subsoil from a drained riparian floodplain contaminated by the discharge of dissolved mercury in a well-aerated surface stream. The two samples contained 48 ppm and 80.7 ppm dry weight (DW) Hg, respectively. The higher Hg concentration at depth results from higher historical Hg releases and the subsequent burial of older deposits with relatively cleaner alluvial sediments.</p><p>The HERFD spectra were collected at 10K and in continuous scanning mode to reduce beam damage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The spectra from the references allowed us to demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity of HERFD to Hg speciation relative to conventional XANES (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Most significant is the salient resonance for Hg-NOM at 12279.2 eV (2p3/2 → 5d transition), which is missing in conventional XANES. The main reason for this difference is the intrinsic broadening of the L3-edge XANES spectra which is as large as 5.5 eV in XANES, and halved to 2.6-2.7 eV in HERFD mode for quantum reasons. This spectral feature is observed systematically when Hg(II) is coordinated linearly, here to two reduced sulfur ligands, but also to oxygen (HgO, Hg acetate), chloride (HgCl2) and iodide (HgI2) ligands. The featureless shape of the XANES spectra means that Hg-NOM species cannot be detected by this technique in a mixture with -HgS in natural materials, such as soil. Using the signature of the 12279.2 eV resonance, the visual detection limit for Hg-NOM mixed with -HgS by HERFD is estimated to be 15 mol % of the total Hg. When compared to those of references, the topsoil spectrum most closely resembles the -HgS spectrum, and the subsoil even more so (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). The modulations observed above the edge come from the Hg-Hg pairs. The topsoil spectrum was modeled successfully with a linear combination of 74 ± 6 % -HgS + 26 ± 6 % Hg complexed to NOM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). It follows that Hg occurs essentially as -HgS in the subsurface and as -HgS and organically-bound Hg-NOM complexes at the soil surface. This is the first time that the second species, which is considered to be the main non-methylated Hg form in organic matter, has been identified in a native soil. A first article is in preparation and will be submitted soon. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

Results from reference compounds show that HERFD has adequate spectral sensitivity to resolve overlapping X-ray contributions from co-occurring Hg species in a multicomponent system.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.02,136.32,527.28,164.82" type="vector_box" /></figure>
