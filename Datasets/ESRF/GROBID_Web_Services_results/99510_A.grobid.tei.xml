<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Observations of seismic waves travelling throughout Earth's interior provide one of the few direct, and arguably the strongest, constraints on the current state of the mantle (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Dziewonski &amp; Anderson, 1981)</ref>. Careful comparison with experimental and computational measurements of the elastic properties of minerals allows this data to be interpreted in terms of mantle mineralogy, chemistry and temperature; information that is not otherwise directly attainable. However, accurate interpretation of seimological data requires high-quality measurements of elastic properties for appropriate minerals, otherwise the information maybe lost or incorrectly deciphered.</p><p>The trasition zone (TZ) is a key region of the Earth located between the upper and lower mantle, and exerts important controls on global recycling, heat flow, mantle convection and mixing. However, it remains unclear whether it possesses a pyrolytic composition whilst its water content is also controversial (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Fei et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Irifune et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mao et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schulze et al., 2018)</ref>. The elastic properties of wadsleyite and ringwoodite (Rw), which account for &gt; 50 wt.% of the TZ, are only sparsely measured at appropriate mantle PT conditions. There has been only one single experiment that reports the acoustic properties of Fo90 Rw up to 19 GPa and 1400 °C and all other studies are limited to temperatures &lt; 1000 °C and pressures &lt; 15 <ref type="bibr">GPa, outside TZ conditions (17.9-23.8 GPa, 1770</ref><ref type="bibr">-1873 K)</ref> and the Rw stability field, not to mention the effect of Fe content on the elastic properties of Rw. The lack of accurate knowledge of these properties is one of the major reasons for our limited knowledge of TZ composition.</p><p>ES-1135 was performed in June-July, 2022. The polycrystalline Rw samples with different Fe concentrations (XFe=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1) were successfully pre-synthesized at UCL using multi-anvil press at 19 GPa and 1473 K and double polished as the starting materials for the ultrasonic measurements at ESRF. During this beam time, eight multi-anvil runs were conducted using the 10/4 assembly with a newly developed X-ray transparent TiC-MgO composite heater. The composition of samples and the maximum PT conditions for each run are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In each run, we first compressed the sample to the targeted pressure (~13-22 GPa) depending on its composition, and then heated the sample to 800-1000 °C to release the stress in the sample during compression. After that, the temperature was decreased and increased in cycles and X-ray diffraction (XRD), imaging and MHz frequency ultrasonic measurements were made during the heating loops to determine the structure, length and acoustic velocities. The temperature was monitored by the thermocouple and pressure was determined using the peaks of NaCl by real-time XRD to make our best not to go out of the Rw stability field. The new diffraction free gaskets were used through the X-ray windows in all experiments.</p><p>In all runs, the TiC heater worked well. In run-1 to run-4, graphite lids were used at the end of the heater which caused instability of the heater above 1200 °C, maybe due to the tranformation of graphite to diamond, therefore, we only used TiC in run-5 to run-8, which proved to be a more stable heater to more than 1400 °C. In all experiments the heater underwent reactions to first form, and subsequently dehydrate, brucite (identified using XRD) at 550 and ~ 900 °C which caused temporal instabilities and in one instance led to a blowout. This was presumed to originate from atmospheric water sorbed to the fine-grained heater in a period of high humidity and not experienced during prior testing at UCL. The thermocouple contacted with the heater in some experiments and could not read correct temperatures (run-1, run-2, run-4) influenced by the direct current through the heater but we managed to avoid such contacts in run-5 to run-8. The ultrasonic signal was not good at the beginning in run-1 to run-4 due to some connection problems (impendance contrasts in wiring and final cable mounting on the press being deformed at high pressure conditions) and quality of the connection cables between the transducer and oscilloscope. However, after several trials, good ultrasonic signals were obtained in later runs (run-5 to run-8, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows an example of our ultrasonic data). At the same time, the sample was observed to be in the middle of the X-ray window after compression, which enables the measurement of sample length through X-ray imaging. Although we did not have good ultrasonic signals in run-1 to run-4, we collected the XRD pattern through several heating loops and therefore by refinement and fitting, we can get high pressure high temperature equation of state parameters of the corresponding phases. In run-5 and run-6, we made ultrasonic measurements at 22.4 GPa and 18.7 GPa respectively up to 1400 °C . In run-7, we made ultrasonic measurements at 20 GPa up to ~ 1000 °C .</p><p>In some experiments, surrounding mica peaks came in at certain high tempratures which was misidentified as wadsleyite due to their simlar peak positions at low 2-theta angles, therefore we tried to decrease the pressure during heating to make it fully transform into wadsleyite, however, blowout happened during such hot decompression at above 900 °C (run-5 and run-7). Another blowout happened in run-8 due to the failure of the diffraction free gaskets in the X-ray window.  Experiments all produced large volumes of XRD and ultrasonic data (typically ~ 8000 diffraction patterns per experiment). In order to deal with this data quantity, new analyses procedures have been under development and have now been successfully implemented for 1 experimental run. Whilst analyses is ongoing, due to experimental difficulties during beamtime it is already known there are gaps in the collected datasets that additional beamtime is required to fill.</p><p>0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 1.40E-05 1.90E-05 2.40E-05 V time (s)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: exemplar ultrasonic data signal from run_5.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To continue and complete our study we will request further beamtime. It proves that the new TiC works well up to at least 1400 °C and we managed to make good starting polycrystaline samples. By adjusting the Al2O3 buffer rod length, the samples are in the middle of the X-ray window which allows its length to be determined. After a few test experiements, we are now also able to get good ultrasonic signals of our samples at high pressure and high temperature conditions. So we believe we find the suitable way to measure the acoustic velocites of ringwoodite. The Mg-endmember sample (run-5) and Fo70 sample (run-6) have been successfully measured up to 1400 °C and we would like more beam time to further study other Fe-bearing compositions also to such high temperatures corresponding to the mantle transition zone conditions.</p><p>Dziewonski A.M., &amp; Anderson, D.L. <ref type="bibr">(1981)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Koch-Müller, M., et al.
