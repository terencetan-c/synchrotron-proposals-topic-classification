<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We proposed to investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Fe containing nanoparticles using Nuclear Resonance Small Angle X-ray Scattering (NRSAXS). The application of the method to the samples of scientific interest becomes possible only nowadays due to the strong increase of the flux at 3 rd generation synchrotrons. The method was applied to study both the magnetic structure of γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles with canted spins in the surface region and dimer nanoparticles γ-Fe 2 O 3 /FePt. We aimed to extract both the structural and the magnetic form factor, which would provide insight into the difference between each other. This new method would offer an unique way for the analysis of magnetic structures in nanoparticles and the single particle shape of heterogeneous complexes of nanoparticles.</p><p>We planed to investigate enriched γ-57 Fe 2 O 3 and partially-enriched γ-57 Fe 2 O 3 /FePt dimer nanoparticles by NRSAXS using Nuclear Forward Scattering (NFS) and the Synchrotron Mössbauer Source (SMS). Both methods have advantages and drawbacks. While NFS provides higher flux by ~3-5 times, SMS allows for directly measuring NRSAXS, related to the particular hyperfine structure. For the γ-Fe 2 O 3 /FePt nanoparticles the SMS setup is the most promising one, because the signal arising from the iron in the Fe 2 O 3 is separated from the signal of the iron in the FePt by different velocities of the Mössbauer drive. The γ-Fe 2 O 3 only give a 6 peak absorption spectrum, which implies the usage of NFS due to the higher flux.</p><p>The first part of the measurement was performed with NFS in March 2013, selected data is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. On the first glance, there is no difference between the electronic (prompt) and nuclear (delayed) scattering. This can be reasoned by different facts. First, there might be no difference in the electronic and the magnetic form factor. Which would mean that the expected canted spins are not canted or they are not at the surface. Second, every resonant scattered photon can also be scattered electronically. If we assume that the electronic scattering cross section is very large, the delayed signal would be the product of a large electronical part and a small nuclear part. Thus, the difference between the nuclear and electronic form factor might not be visible.</p><p>The second part of the measurements were performed with SMS in July 2013. We observed already in a early stage of the experiment that the flux is too low to get reliable results over a large enough Q-range, thus we switched to investigate the behaviour of spherical γ-57 Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticle with full enrichment in comparison to dimer 57 Fe 2 O 3 /FePt nanoparticles with only the iron oxide sphere enriched in NFS geometry. The obtained data is depicted in Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The applied magnetic field strongly influence the dimer nanoparticles and align them parallel to the field, in contrast the single spheres of iron oxid are only slightly influenced. This behaviour is quite unexpected, because magnetometry suggest for the γ-57 Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles nearly complete alignment of the spins in a 1 T field, i.e., the shape of zero-field cooled and field cooled curves is equal and nearly complete saturation in the hysteresis loop is found. We have obtained NFS data on the γ-57 Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles in magnetic fields up to 7.5 T from the first part of the experiment, which are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The oscillation frequency changes in the highlighted regions with increasing field. This is related to the expected alignment of the spins parallel to the magnetic field, which we observed for the dimers at much smaller fields. Even at 7.5 T no complete alignment seems to be established.</p><p>In summary, we were able to measure NRSAXS with quite good statistics in a NFS setup. Preliminary results reveal no difference between normal SAXS and NRSAXS. Nevertheless, we proved that the flux is high enough in order to perform the measurement. The SMS option exhibits a too small flux for NRSAXS investigations, roughly speaking a factor of 5 or 10 enhancement would be needed. We obtained field dependent NFS and SMS data of the used nanoparticles, which exhibit unexpected behaviour. A corresponding manuscript is under preparation.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig 4.: NFS data of 57 Fe 2 O 3 Nanoparticles with different applied magnetic fields orthogonal to beam direction.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,311.40,538.90,244.90,170.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
