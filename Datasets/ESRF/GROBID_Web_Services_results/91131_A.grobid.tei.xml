<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT</head><p>We propose to investigate the spin dynamics of iron-based bistable magnetic molecules, also known as Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs), <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> when a thin film of these molecules is deposited on an array of metallic plasmonic nanostructures that are expected to act as optical antennas and to enhance the electromagnetic field generated by irradiation in the visible-NIR range. The purpose is to employ the SMMs as model magnetic units to investigate the possibility to achieve plasmon-assisted optical switching with circularly polarized light. To detect this effect energy resolved Mößbauer spectroscopy as implemented at ID18, was than used. We have recently shown that this technique is able to study a monolayer of 57 Fe enriched SMMs. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> Moreover, the spin dynamics is detectable over a time window (10 -6 -10 -9 s), which is better suited for the expected fast switching than XMCD. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> We plan to highlight the induced modifications in the transition rates between spin levels using the protocol recently employed to reproduce the Mößbauer spectra of Fe 4 SMMs on gold. The study will allow to shed light on the phenomenon of optical switching of the magnetization at the nanoscale, whose rationalization is still to be achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL SETUP</head><p>The Mössbauer measurements were realized at the Synchrotron Mössbauer Source (SMS) set up at the ID 18 beamline of ESRF. The radiation coming from the SMS has an energy of 14.4 keV, suitable for the absorption by 57 Fe nuclei, it is narrow (its FWHM is less than three natural linewidths) and can be focused to mm 2 or μm 2 spot sizes. The sample was measured in grazing incidence geometry. Energy-domain Mössbauer spectra were realized by collecting the radiation scattered by the sample. The sample was inserted in a cryostat with minimum achievable temperature of about 3 K. The sample was mounted in the vertical plane. The radiation coming from the SMS is linearly polarized with the electric field lying in the vertical plane of the laboratory. The irradiation of the sample was realized by positioning a laser (wavelength = 405 nm, maximum power ~ 30 mW) on a lateral window of the cryostat. Consequently, the direction of laser light was perpendicular to the surface of the sample. In this setup a magnetic field (intensity ~ 5 T) was applied, that was directed parallel to the surface of the sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAMPLE</head><p>We studied a sublimated sample of the Fe 4 SMM. Fe 4 was enriched in 57 Fe and sublimated on a SiO 2 substrate (thickness ~ 400 nm) having plasmonic structures on top. In particular, Al rings (external diameter = 331 nm, internal diameter = 63 nm, height = 20 -25 nm) with absorption band at 390 nm were considered. A thickness of Fe 4 of the order of 10 nm was sublimated on this substrate. Other samples, such as 10 nm of Fe 4 sublimated on a SiO 2 substrate having plasmonic disks on top and a dropcast of Fe 4 on Au substrate, were studied, however their spectra show features that cannot be associated with Fe 4 alone and they are not reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEASUREMENTS</head><p>As a first step a thermal characterization of the sample was realized. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the spectra taken at three different temperatures are reported. The spectrum realized at 3 K shows the characteristic features of Fe 4 , i.e. the presence of splitting of the external lines of the iron sextet due to the presence of inequivalent iron sites in the molecule. Moreover, as expected, a reduced intensity of the external lines and an increased intensity of the central one is encountered with increasing the temperature. The irradiation measurements were realized by keeping the sample at 3 K and irradiating it with the maximum laser power in three different polarizations of light (linear polarization, right circular polarization and left circular polarization). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the measured spectra are reported. The spectra do not differ much from the laser off spectrum, whatever is the polarization of light. Little differences in the height of the peaks with respect to the laser off spectrum can be associated with small fluctuations in the temperature.  In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the measurements realized at different temperatures with an external magnetic field of 5 T are reported. The addition of this magnetic field leads to a simplification of the spectra, due to the presence of preferred transitions with respect to others. No differences can be encountered between the 3 K and 5 K spectra. The spectrum taken at 20 K is instead different, because the thermal energy exceeds the characteristic energy of the system. Finally, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the spectrum measured at 3 K with 5 T and laser irradiation with left circular polarization light is reported. Little differences with the laser off spectrum can be encountered, that can be associated with thermal fluctuations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>A qualitative analysis of the spectra reveals that intact Fe 4 molecules are present in the sample and their thermal evolution is the expected one. Moreover, also the principal differences introduced in the spectra by the application of an external magnetic field are in line with the theoretical ones. The laser irradiation seems to have produced no detectable effect on the spectra, whatever was the polarization of light. However, a verification of this conclusions needs a proper fitting of the measured spectra. Refrences 1. Gatteschi, D., et al., Molecular nanomagnets. Oxford University Press: Oxford, UK, 2006.  2.
