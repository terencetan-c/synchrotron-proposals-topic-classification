<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the beamtime experiment 26-01920, at the EXAFS beamline BM26A, DUBBLE, was to acquire local structure information during the solvothermal decomposition reaction of iron and nickel dithiocarbamates, using XAS. The decomposition is a popular reaction for the formation of phase pure sulfides and thus understanding its kinetics is vitally important to be able to manipulate it.</p><p>The initial plan was to track three reactions: the decomposition of Fe( i BuDTC) 3 in oleylamine, Ni( i BuDTC) 2 in oleylamine, and mixed Fe( i BuDTC) 3 and Ni( i BuDTC) 2 in oleylamine, at temperatures between 180 and 320°C.</p><p>In the original plan, a capillary furnace for liquid media was to be built and used to perform the decompositions. During offline experiments it was realized that the cell was intrinsically unsuitable for the experiment -the liquid would be pushed out of the heat chamber and beamspot by expanding pockets of air. Instead, the in situ hydro/solvothermal cell built by the Sankar group at UCL was used. The highest temperatures could not be reached with the cell due to heat loss, however, high quality data was gained of before the point of iron and nickel sulfide crystallization. Scan time was approximately 12 minutes per spectrum for a typical acquisition during in situ experiments. The most successful data acquisition occurred at a ramp rate of 1°C/min. Reactions were held at a final temperature of 200°C, sulfide formation was shown to occur -in all cases -before the maximum temperature of 200°C and was associated with a drop in data quality due to the immiscibility of the products in oleylamine: the inhomogenous dynamic environment was an obstruction to good XAS data acquisition.</p><p>8400 8500</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: in situ XANES data of the decomposition of nickel iso-butyl dithiocarbamate at a ramp rate of 1°C/min and scan time of approximately 12 minutes. Data shows a gradual change in the edge between room temperature and 170°C (between red and blue) followed by an abrupt change in edge, and post edge oscillations.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an example of in situ XANES data during the decomposition of nickel iso-butyl dithiocarbamate. The data indicates a two stage process: firstly, a continual change occurs between room temperature and 170°C (red to blue). This is followed by the mass formation of the sulfide which is abrupt.</p><p>The pattern is unique to the nickel dithiocarbamate in both pure and mixed decompositions. Iron shows a well defined transition state at a later temperature and an edge shift associated with the formation of iron (II) species from iron (III) iso-butyl dithiocarbamate.</p><p>Several ex situ data were acquired of various synthesized sulfides and oxides to use as standards for linear combination fitting, and multi-component analysis. High quality EXAFS data was taken in order to perform detailed analysis for retrieving bond distances.</p><p>There is much knowledge to be gained through extensive analysis of the data collected at this beamtime, and several areas for further investigation have already been exposed. For example, one exciting prospect is to fully characterize the sulfides formed below 200°C which are known to be amorphous [1] and unassigned by XRD, once this is complete, a separate experiment can be performed to conclude phase change at higher temperatures using solid pellets rather than reaction mixtures. This will allow us to map phase against temperature and refine the reaction method for future catalytic purposes.</p><p>[1] Han, W. and M.Y.
