<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Formation of supraparticles of semiconductor nanocrystals Experiment number: SC-4487 Beamline: ID02 Date of experiment: from: 10-03-2017 to: 13-03-2017 Date of report: 08-09-2017 Shifts:</p><p>Report:</p><p>We have performed small-and-wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) to study the self-assembly of iron cobalt oxide (FeCoO) nanocrystals (NCs) in three dimensional crystalline supraparticles (SPs) through spherical confinement. [1,2] So far the formation of SPs has been investigated only through theoretical simulations from analysis of the final product, but in this experiment we have observed for the first time the formation of the SPs in-situ through X-ray scattering.</p><p>Spherical SPs have been introduced recently [1] and they are formed through the selfassembly of NCs in the spherical confinement of an oil-in-water emulsion. The NCs are firstly dispersed in an oil phase (cyclohexane) in contact with a water phase containing: surfactants, to stabilize the two phases, and sugar, to increase the viscosity of the system. The two phase system is then emulsified through the application of a shear force using a homebuilt shear cell, resulting in an emulsion of oil droplets containing NCs in the water phase. The resulting emulsion is then put at 68°C in order to evaporate the oil phase. While shrinking due to evaporation, the oil droplets will pull the NCs together until final crystalization into SPs.</p><p>For our experiment we brought the shear cell, the oil phase and the water phase from Utrecht and we performed the emulsification at ESRF. The emulsion was then put in a vial laying on an heating plate at 68°C and folded by heating foils. The temperature was monitored with a thermocouple and kept constant at 68±2°C. The emulsion was then pumped through a capillary, with the use of a peristaltic pump, where the droplets were probed with X-rays (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The droplets were continuously heated and pumped through the capillary for 6-7 hours until crystalization occurred.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1: Digital picture of the setup used for the measurement</head><p>The SAXS measurements have been performed with three different detector distances (1-5-20 m), in order to explore the full q range, probing the sample for 30 ms and averaging the signal over ten measurements. In particular, with the detector set at 1 m we probed the q values related to the single NCs (size ~ 10 nm), while with the detector at 5 and 20 m we probed the q range corresponding to the oil droplets in water (size ~ few µm). In the measurements the form factor of the NCs is clearly visible, and the depth of the peaks indicates a relatively good monodispersity, around 7%, also confirmed by ex-situ TEM. The form factor of the droplets is also visible in the late stages of the experiments, but the very small depth of the peaks indicates a quite large polydispersity (around 20%), as previosuly observed in perliminary experiments in Utrecht (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: SAXS data of the probed emulsion at three different detector distances: 1 m (green), 5 m (yellow) and 30 m (blue).</head><p>During the experiment, we observe a clear increase of the volume fraction of the NCs in the droplets , which leads to the crystalization of the NCs into an FCC lattice. The crystallization kinetics are clearly visible from the appearance of structure factor peaks in the scattering data, which also show that the NC lattice contracts over time. Preliminary analysis of the data allowed us to index the structure-factor peaks up to 18 FCC reflections, which highlights the degree of long-range order of NCs inside the SP FCC lattice (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3: SAXS data of the crystalized sample (blue) with indication of calculated FCC reflections (red)</head><p>Concerning the WAXS data, we managed to follow the evaporation of the cyclohexane through the decrease in the scattering signal associated to it, thus corroborating the results observed with SAXS measurements.</p><p>For each experiments we performed static measurements over samples of SPs and NCs already characterized in Utrecht through TEM, in order to have references, and we also performed measurements of different background solutions for a better analysis of the data. All the samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed through ex-situ TEM and STEM in Utrecht, where we confirmed the formation of the SPs with FCC crystal structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). To summarize, we observed for the first time the in-situ formation of SPs from the selfassembly of NCs in the spherical confinement of an oil-in-water emulsion through X-ray scattering. In particular we performed SAXS measurements at three different detector distances in order to be able to follow the evaporation in the full q range. From scattering data we clearly observe the form factor of the NCs as well as of the oil droplets, from which we can extract the size, polidispersity and volume fraction over time. The latter is particularly interesting for us as it allows us to see the evolution of the spherical confinement over time, from the just-formed droplets to the final crystalization in SPs. The scattering data clearly show the crystalization of the NCs in SPs characterized by an FCC structure. After background subtraction, we preliminarly managed to index up to 18 reflection of the FCC crystal. We are currently working on fitting the complete scattering curve for all recorded frames in time, to obtain a full time-resolved picture on this exciting crystallization process. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 4 :</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4: SE-STEM image of one of the SPs synthesized during the experiment; FCC crystal facets are clealry visible on the top and on the sides.</figDesc><graphic coords="5,174.95,217.70,245.30,252.10" type="bitmap" /></figure>
