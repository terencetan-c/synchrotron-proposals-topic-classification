<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>It is well known that the properties of grown materials are strongly determined by the solidification step, so that a precise mastering of growth processing is essential to reproducibly tailor products of specified quality. In particular, during the growth segregation of chemical species may be induced by defects (grain boundaries, dislocations, ..), grains structure or the solidification microstructure itself, which could appear at the solid-liquid interface due to the Mullins-Sekerka instability <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. A complete understanding of growth processing, from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale is a key point both from technological and fundamental science points of view.</p><p>Our objective is to achieve in situ and real time investigations of the solidification of metallic alloys using most advanced X-ray imaging techniques (radiography and diffraction topography) with the increased capabilities of 3 rd generation synchrotrons. More precisely, the project addresses two different issues:</p><p>-Columnar and equiaxed growth of refined and non-refined binary alloys (Al -3.5 wt% Ni) [1, 2] -Analysis of growth mechanism in quasicrystal (Al-Pd-Mn system) [3]</p><p>[1] Mullins, W.W. &amp; Sekerka R.F., J. Appl. <ref type="bibr">Phys. 35 (1964)</ref> 444. [2] Martorano, M.A., Beckermann, C. &amp; Gandin, Ch.-A., Metall. and Mater. Trans. A, 34A (2003) 1657. [3] Janot, C. &amp; Dubois, J-M., Les Quasicristaux : Matière à paradoxes (EDP Sciences, Les Ulis, France, 1998) Ch. 3.</p><p>For both issues, directional solidification is a key technique which allows one to analyze independently the effect of solute concentration, temperature gradient and pulling rate on the solid-liquid interface. For this project, an experimental set-up has been developed in collaboration with ID19 beamline team members. It is composed of an Ultra-High-Vacuum furnace for "in situ" and real time observations of solidification by X-ray imaging. Its specificity lies in that it allows both to control the two main parameters of unidirectional solidification (pulling velocity and temperature gradient) and to record X-ray radiographs and X-ray topographs, either independently or simultaneously. During previous allocated beam time (6 months project), we performed a series of tests and the preliminary results showed that [4] it is necessary to use a furnace ensuring a vertical growth direction instead of a horizontal one, in order to avoid disturbances of the solidification process induced by natural convection. During these preliminary investigations, X-ray imaging techniques have also been tested in close relation to the scientific objectives.</p><p>Therefore, during the 1 st part of the 1 st year of the project, in collaboration with the ID19 engineering staff (Pascal Bernard and René Chagnon), we have mainly performed the experimental development of the UHV-furnace and X-Ray imaging techniques (absorption/phase contrast radiography and topography). The vertical axis furnace was successfully tested.</p><p>Then, in the 2 nd part of the 1 st year of the project, several outstanding observations were obtained, often for the first time. These results were presented in international conferences:</p><p>• Columnar dendritic growth: o Initial transient [5,7,9] o Bending of secondary arms during dendritic growth [7] • Columnar to equiaxed transition and equiaxed growth: o Dynamical arrangement of equiaxed dendrites in the equiaxed regime [5, 6] o Grain structure maps and columnar to equiaxed transition [6] • Quasicrystal growth: o Facetted growth [5,8,9] o Nucleation and free growth of grains above the interface at high growth rate [5,8,9].</p><p>These appealing results opened new fields of investigations with X-ray techniques applied to these phenomena.</p><p>Articles and abstract are listed below.</p></div>		</body>

It is well known that properties of the grown material are largely controlled by the microstructures left in the solid during processing. Thus, a precise mastering of the solidification is essential to tailor products in a reproducible fashion to a specified quality. One major difficulty for this study is the real time and in situ observation of the interface, especially for metallic alloys. A possibility is to use an intense and coherent 3rd generation X-Ray beam. By combining different X-ray imaging techniques (absorption/phase contrast radiography and diffraction topography), we have studied the directional melting and solidification of aluminium-based alloys. The preliminary results show the great potential of these techniques for the study of the coupling between stress effects and microstructure formation in solidification processing.</p><p>[5] T.
