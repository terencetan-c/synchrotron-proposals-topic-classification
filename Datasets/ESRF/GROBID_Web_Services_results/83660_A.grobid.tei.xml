<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental setup -included a cooling chamber, an X-ray detector, and an optical setup to guide the 532 nm ns-pulsed laser beam to impinge the water drop to induce ice nucleation. The following equipment and elements were tested successfully and used in the experiment: A home-made cooling chamber which allows (a) deposition of ultra-pure water drops on a hydrophobic glass slide in helium atmosphere (b) monitoring and illuminating the water drop with laser beams from two orthogonal directions (c) probing the growth of the laser-induced ice nuclei with a pulsed X-ray beam and X-ray detector. (d) a sleeve to fill the volume between the cooling chamber and the X-ray detctor with helium in order to increase the signal to noise ratio.</p><p>The optical setup was constructed to guide the beam to impinge the water drop either from above (vertical direction), the side (horizontal direction) or from both directions simultaneously. A further element in this setup was the ability to double the pulse duration from 5 ns to 10 ns. This was achieved by using two polarizing beam splitter cubes; first to split the pulse and then merge its split parts to be co-aligned after one part has traveled through a delay line of 3 meters that avoids a temporal overlap. In addition, to control the polarization status of the incoming linearly polarized laser beams, a quarter waveplate in each direction was installed before the corresponding entrance window. Each beam passed through a 0.5 mm apertures to reduce the angles of the refracted rays in the drop.</p><p>Procedure After deposition of water drop, we moved laterally the chamber with an X-Y-Z translational stage to overlap the drop with the intersection point of the laser beam/s with the X-ray beam. Once the point of incidence was set, the chamber was cooled to a certain temperature. Upon temperature stabilization (&lt; 0.1 degree), the drop was exposed to laser pulses (at 10 Hz repetition rate) during periods of two minutes.</p><p>The probing pulsed X-ray beam was orthogonal to the laser beams, and was synchronized to probe diffraction 10 -200 ns after the laser pulses. The overlap between the X-ray beam spot (100×60 m 2 ) with the spot of each laser beam (500 m diameter) was verified with a fluorescent screen and a microscope equipped with a CCD camera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The laser induced ice nucleation effect is shown in the series of snapshots in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-d</ref> that illustrates the drop in different stages toward complete freezing. The first apperance of diffraction peaks after illumination with pulsed orthogonal laser beams (that were with linear and orthogonal polarizations) is evident from the Xray detector image shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>. The diffraction image of a fully frozen drop shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> reveals a variety of diffraction peaks at different orientations. Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref> shows the evolution of (scaled) intensity from a region of diffraction peaks (not shown) under different illumination configuration versus the time that is represented by the X-ray image number (shifted). The different transition times from a liquid state to a crystalline state for different illumination configurations is clearly evident from the figure. This transition time depends on the growing rate of the probed crystallites by the X-ray beam and the freezing dynamics of their surrounding. Thus, it hints about the nucleation mechanism.</p><p>The main problem in this type of experiment is to probe with the X-ray beam the initial location of nucleation. In case that the laser beam is directed to vertical incidence, we have evidences (CCD camera) for a preferred heterogeneous nucleation that started at the bottom interface with the hydrophobic glass (as expected). But, mistakenly the X-ray beam was directed to a higher level of 1 mm above this interface.</p><p>Moreover, we had no programs to analyze such data in real time (already resolved). In principle, same problem holds for illumination from the side. e e a b c d f g e</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. (a-d) Snapshots illustrating the laser-induced freezing of a water drop on a hydrophobic glass slide.Freezing was achieved by illuminating the sample with two orthogonal pulsed laser beams with a time delay of 10 ns between the two.
