<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this experiment was to study the possible formation of dopant cluster formation in doubly doped functional oxides by means of x-ray linear dichroism (XLD) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (X-MCD).The beamtime was split between soft (ID08) and hard (ID12) x-ray absorption spectroscopy. One set of samples was 3%N-codoped and undoped 2% Fe:TiO 2 . Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the XLD spectra at the anion sublattice of O and N K-edges, respectively. From the very similar XLD signature it can be directly concluded that the N is substitutionally incorporated in the TiO 2 host lattice. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the respective XLD at the Ti K-edge and L 3/2 -edges revealing that there are small changes at the pre-edge features of the Ti K-edge upon N-doping. The corresponding features at the L 3/2 -edges are much less pronounced. XLD and thus also XMCD at tested in the XEPR setup to determine to maximum achievable XMCD signal size at the given experimental conditions, i.e. ~40 K and an external field around 5 kOe to decide to most suitable sample for XEPR. The resulting XMCD spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> for two samples each.  the Fe absorption edges were impossible to be recorded, the strong Ti K-absorption because of the rutile substrate precluded any measurement at the Fe K-edge and the Fe L 3/2 -edges suffered from large background artifacts in TEY and hardly any signal in FY. The second set of samples consists of a series of N-codoped Co:ZnO samples with a range of different N as well as Co concentrations. XMCD measurements at ID12 were limited due to the breakdown of the magnet power supply of the 17 T magnet, which made measurements of the magnetic anisotropy by M(H) curves impossible. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows XLD measurements at the Co and O K-edges, respectively. The signatures reflect the overall trend also seen at the Zn K-edge (not shown) reflecting the variety of structural perfection depending on the preparation conditions. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> shows the XLD at the N K-edge in fluorescence yield for most of the samples in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Comparing the XLD of the O K-edge and the N K-edge is becomes obvious that the N is not substitutionally incorporated into the ZnO lattice. The N K-edge exhibits one pronounced peak with sizable XLD which is characteristic for molecular N 2 . Since both total electron yield as well as XP did not show any significant amount of N, one has to conclude that these N 2 molecules may be incorporated in the ZnO matrix. Either it can be found at grain boundaries or the molecules may substitute for O vacancies which can be found due to the low amount of O in the sputter gas. Nonetheless, the XLD spectra at all four constituents do not show any indication for the formation of dopant complexes in Co:ZnO:N. In addition, the N data point towards molecular N 2 rather than substitutional doing which may also explain why N-codoping did not lead to the expected p-type conductivity in these samples yet. In contrast, the Ti K-edge of Fe:TiO 2 :N shows indications of changes in the electronic structure of the host crystal upon N-doping; however, this could not be corroborated at the Fe K-edge due to the large fluorescence background of the rutile substrate. Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> shows exemplarily two XMCD spectra and the corresponding M(H) curves at the Co K-edge in plane and out of plane, respectively. For this 1Âµm thick reference film the small anisotropy of the M(H) curves could be recorded with sufficient signal to noise ratio; four other samples were tried as well. The obtained five M(H) curves will be compared to those at the Co L 3/2 -edges (not shown). In summary, a large set of XLD and some XMCD spectra could be recorded for different doubly doped functional oxides. While for Fe:TiO 2 :N substitutional incorporation of N was found the Co:ZnO:N only show signs of the incorporation of molecular N 2 into the host matrix. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig 2: XLD spectra of N-doped and undoped Fe:TiO 2 (rutile) at the Ti K-edge and the L 3/2 -edges.
