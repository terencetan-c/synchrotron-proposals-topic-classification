<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Anomalous scattering at the K edge of zirconium atom has been performed on a series of altered glass grains containing different amounts of Zr. The glass composition was (SiO 2 /B 2 O 3 /Na 2 O/ZrO 2 )=(70/15/15/0-10) and the grains size was in the range 30-50 microns. The alterations were driven as follow: a fixed amount of glass powder (300mg was put in a Teflon container with 50ml of pure water. The temperature of the experiment was 90°C and four different durations were chosen : 0.5-1-2-4 months in order to cover the whole dynamic of the alteration process. Finally, the 30 samples of 2mm thick were sealed in specific cells prior to the venue at the ERSF. Their thickness was 2mm yielding a typical transmission of 0.3 for 50% of solid volume fraction.</p><p>The 30 samples together with reference were examined at 6 energies ranging from 17717eV to 18000eV. The quantitative interpretation of an anomalous scattering experiment requires to work at the absolute scale of intensity. This has been done an all the required calibrations [PM0, PM1, Filters, CPS on the CCD]were done at each energy. The size of the beam at the sample position was 0.1*0.1mm2. The diagrams of scattering were accumulated for two sample-detector separations (465 and 2155mm) with the small beam-stop yielding a Q range of 0.004-0.7Å -1 . A well known reference ie Lupolen was measured to ensure that the calibration was correct and the measured value of the intensity at the peak (6cm -1 ) was in very good agreement with all the former measured on that polymer sheet.</p><p>The main important results that we have obtained are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and 3. The effects of the Zr amount on the structure of the altered glass grains (after 4 months) are reported in Figure2. A large scattering due to a porous layer is clearly visible at large Q. Indeed, when the glass surface is left in contact with hot water for a very long time, the labile atoms, like B and Na, are leached out of the matrix, meanwhile</p><p>Si is only partially solubilzed and Zr not at all. Therefore, a layer enriched in Si and Zr appears at the surface of the glass grains. 0.01 1 100 10000 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 Log(Q en Å -1 ) Log(I en cm -1 ) 0% Zr 0.5% Zr 1% Zr 2% Zr 5% Zr 10% Zr</p><p>allows us to propose a model for the alteration of that kind of borosilicated glass, which will be compared to recent simulations (of another group) by means of Monte-Carlo. Nevertheless, the reason which motivated the anomalous part of the experiment was to check whether the Zr atoms formed a separated phase (like ZrO 2 ) in the altered layer or if they remain homogeneously dispersed in the residual skeleton. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> proposes an unambiguous answer to the question. Indeed, taking the glass containing 10% Zr and altered 4 months, the diagram obtained at 17717eV is shown in this figure together with the one obtained at 18000eV.</p><p>It can be seen that the scattering is solely divided by a factor which is constant in the full Q range. The factor is in good agreement with the calculation base on the composition of the altered layer (deduced from chemical titrations of the leaching solution). 1,00E-06 1,00E-05 1,00E-04 1,00E-03 0,001 0,010 0,100 1,000 Q (Å -1 ) IQ 4</p><p>The scattering curve is not deformed when the energy approaches the edge of absorption, showing that the variation in electron density is the same everywhere in the skeleton. A similar result was obtained for every amount of Zr and every time of alteration. This is an important (although a bit disappointing when compared to the amount of efforts!) conclusion which makes the interpretation of the data much easier at a fixed energy.</p><p>Finally, data were fully interpreted on this basis and important conclusions were drawn from the experiment : in a static mode (no renewal of water), the alteration proceeds through a constant amount of porous surface, which is controlled by the solubility of the Si, itself depending on the initial addition of Zr in the composition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1It is clear from Figure1that : the higher the amount of Zr, the thinner the porosity. For every Zr amount, a porous specific surface can be defined as shown by the Porod regime observed at large.
