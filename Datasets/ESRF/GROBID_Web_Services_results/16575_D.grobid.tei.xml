<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the proposed experiment was to study the mechanisms and conditions leading to well-ordered semiconducting thin films of large organic thin films. A series of samples of Diindenoperylene (DIP) grown on silicon-oxide with different thicknesses was studied. We determined the evolution of surface roughness as a function of film thickness (in reflectivity experiments) and carried out diffuse-scattering measurements in the small-angle regime. These data were used to determine the scaling exponents in the evolution of the surface morphology which is closely related to distinct growth models. The theory of self-affine surface morphologies is a field that was extensively studied in recent years. However, there is a lack of data on large organic molecules which may exhibit different growth mechanisms compared to inorganic systems due to their shape anisotropy and weaker inter-molecular interactions. DIP thin films show a high degree of order and a lattice spacing of 16.5Å and we could measure the specular rod of each sample up to the 8 th order of the out-of plane Bragg reflection.</p><p>We have analyzed the data in combination with complementary data in Stuttgart (Non-contact AFM). The most important findings are listed below, but we emphasize that they are preliminary in nature:</p><p>1. We fitted the complete specular rod of the samples with a model based on kinematical scattering theory and were able to determine the electron density along the z-axis, ρ el (z), to a high degree of precision. It turned out that the electron density exhibits strong oscillations with a ratio between maximum and minimum of approximately 2.</p><p>2. We could determine the evolution of the roughness as a function of film thickness and could determine the growth exponent β which plays an important role in the theory of self-affine surfaces.</p><p>Apparently, β, is systematically higher than what is expected on the basis of existing theories. We are in the process of improving the understanding of the underlying models together with our collaborators from the theoretical side.</p><p>3. We are currently working on the fitting of the rocking scans with a model based on the formalism of Sinha et al.</p><p>[1] (see Figure ). We obtain very good agreement for the fits of the diffuse scattering.</p><p>These fits provide us with the roughness exponent α and the correlation length ξ of the DIPsurfaces. We then will compare this value of α with the value obtained by non-contact AFM measurements.</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] S.K.</p><p>Sinha, E.B. Sirota, S. Garoff, and H.E. Stanley, Phys. Rev.
