<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Micro-XANES spectra have been collected at the Fe K-edge for a wide group of natural impact glasses (micro-tektites) belonging to all the three known micro-tektite strewn field. In addition, also a set of micro impact glasses recently discovered during a drilling project at the Bosumtwi crater has been analysed, and the results compared with those of the micro-tektites originated from the same crater. This is on absolute, the first comprehensive study on a so wide set of micro-tektites and micro-impact glasses. The experimental set-up has been devised in order to collect both high-resolution XANES and K-alpha detected XAS spectra at the same time. For few samples, also the complete RIXS spectrum has been collected. A complete set of Fe model compounds spanning all the knowh Fe oxidation states and coordination number (Fe 2+ in 4-, 5-, 6-, 8-fold coordination and Fe 3+ in 4-, 5-, 6-fold coordination) has been used in order to extract precise information on Fe oxidation state and coordinationnumber from pre-edge peak analysis. All the collected spectra display a very good signal to noise ratio, thus allowing a good interpretationof the data. Both sets of measurement indicate that Fe is essentially divalent in all the micro-tektites studied, irrespective of their composition, formation age, and burial conditions. Average coordination number is intermediate between 4 and 5. The micro impact glasses coming from the boswmtwi core, despite formed at the same impact as the Ivory-Coast microtektites, display consistently higher Fe oxidation state than IVC micro-tektites, reinforcing the current view that tektites (and microtektites) are consistently more reduced compared to other impact glasses. These data also indicate that glassy micro-spherules found in the K/T boundary layer, (regarded as micro-tektites by some author) should definitely regarded as micro impact glasses.</p></div>		</body>
