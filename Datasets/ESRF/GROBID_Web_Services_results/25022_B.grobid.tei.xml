<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The intention of this experiment was to use two blazed linear fresnel lenses with ultra high efficiencies in a coherence matched geometry to produce a intense microfocus spot. The lenses had been tested in a previous beam time (MI-563), and they showed diffraction efficiencies of up to 65% in the 10-15 keV region. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> depicts the used linear Fresnel lenses and the setup used. We used a beam energy of 12.7 keV. The tested combination of lenses had the following parameters:</p><p>• For vertical focusing: 200 µm aperture, 800 nm outermost period, 750 mm focal length, 87° tilt • For horizontal focusing: 50 µm aperture, 800 nm outermost period, 187 mm focal length, 87° tilt</p><p>The efficiency of the vertically focusing lens was measured to be 62%. Using two of these lenses in series thus gave a total efficiency of close to 40%. The spot size of the lens-combination was tested in two different ways:</p><p>• We recorded the tantalum fluorescence signal obtained by scanning a Ta grating with variable grating constant across a focal spot. If the width of the micro-focus is significantly smaller than the grating period this leads to strong variations of the fluorescence signal, depending on whether the binary tantalum grating is fully hit by the focal spot or not. Going to smaller grating periods (regions in the left part of the figure) these oscillations gradually decrease and finally cease, meaning that the according grating period cannot be resolved any more. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the recorded signal and the derived modulation transfer function (MTF). The MTF cuts off at about 2 µm in horizontal and vertical direction.</p><p>• As a second test we performed knife edge scans over a Ta edge while recording the Ta fluorescence.</p><p>The resulting data are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. A FWHM of 1.9 µm can be derived.</p><p>The focal spot size is approx. twice larger than expected. We assume that instabilities of the beam line are the cause for this. Nevertheless, the lens combination gives 2 µm, a gain of 1000 and a divergence of only 270 µrad, which makes it an excellent device for µSAXS experiments. The device is now available at ID13 for user experiments.</p><p>We would like to thank M. Burghammer, J. Meyer, L. Lardiere, and L. Claustre for their excellent support. 0 20 40 60 80 100 4000 8000 12000 16000 20000 Ta-counts position of test object/[µm] fluorescence counts 200 300 400 500 600 700 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 visibility of the grating lines/[mm] Measured Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) in : horizontal direction vertical direction theory (assuming horizontal/vertical spot widths of 2.1/2.35 µm): horizontal direction vertical direction Fig. 2: Measured fluorescence signal (left) and derived visibility of a binary tantalum grating (right).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: SEM image of a linear 4-level Si FZP with 800 nm outermost zone width(left). By a tilting of a linear FZP with respect to the x-ray beam, the diffraction efficiency can be tuned to maximum. Two such lenses are capable of twodimensional focusing to give a spot (top right). By choosing an appropriate ratio of the lenses focal lengths, the aperture can be matched to the spatial coherence lengths of the source (lower right).</figDesc><graphic coords="2,38.16,558.08,314.40,144.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
