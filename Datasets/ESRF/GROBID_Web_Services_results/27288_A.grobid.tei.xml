<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High-pressure, angular-dispersive, X-ray powder diffraction measurements have been performed on the heavy-fermion superconductors CeXIn 5 (X = Co, Rh) and PuCoGa 5 . The main interest in this work was the evolution, as a function of pressure, of the c/a ratio in each of these tetragonal (P4/mmm) systems. This followed recent evidence for structural tuning of the superconductivity in these (Ce, Pu) '115' families of compound <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is worth noting here that our original proposal to ID30 planned to investigate several compositions from the Pu 115 family (i.e. PuXGa 5 for X = Co, Rh and Ir), only. However, within the intermediate period, between proposal submission and experimental preparations (i.e. sample-DAC loadings), we became aware of recent high-pressure diffraction studies on Ce 115s made at the APS [2,3], which, for CeRhIn 5 in particular, concluded a double-peak dependence of c/a on pressure (0 &lt; P &lt; 6 GPa), a dependence which, we believe, is not strongly supported by the data in ref. 2. On this basis, we decided to study only one Pu composition, i.e. PuCoGa 5 (X = Co), and devote the remaining beamtime to (re-)investigations of compositions from the Ce 115 family; in particular, to confirm, or otherwise, the double-peak c/a(P) for CeRhIn 5 , using superior pressure conditions (i.e. greater hydrostaticity) to those achieved in ref. 2.</p><p>Powder samples of CeXIn 5 (X = Co, Rh) and PuCoGa 5 , each of a similar quantity (~ 10 µg), were loaded into diamond-anvil cells of the Syassen-Holzapfel type (2θ max ~ 14 deg.), with diamond culets of 300 µm (diameter) and fitted with inconel gaskets, each with a 150 µm (diameter) hole. In the case of the Pu compound, to avoid the risk of contamination, the powder was combined with epoxy resin ('glue') to form a solid piece, prior to loading. Silicon oil was used as the pressure transmitting medium (PTM) for all compounds, except CeXIn 5 where two loadings were made, one with oil and the other with nitrogen (both, especially the latter PTM, constitute improved hydrostaticity as compared to the studies of ref.</p><p>2). Using a collimated (40 µm × 40 µm) beam of a 61.33 keV (0.20215 Å) X-rays (from ID30), and calibrating pressure using the ruby-fluorescence method, diffraction patterns were collected (using a MAR345 image-plate detector) for each compound, at pressure increments of ~ 0.5 to 1 GPa, up to P max ~ 15 GPa for CeXIn 5 and ~ 37 GPa for PuCoGa 5 . These patterns were then processed using ESRF software (Fit2D) to obtain a data-format suitable for structural analysis. Since the main interest in this work was the pressure evolution of the c/a ratio, structural analysis of diffraction patterns was limited to lattice parameter determination, only, using the profile-matching (or 'Le Bail') technique [4] implemented using the program Fullprof. Examples of the quality of data fits generally achieved are given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The c/a(P) results for CeRhIn 5 are in discord with the double-peak variation deduced in the previous work (ref <ref type="bibr">.</ref> 2); our observation is that of a monotonic increase in c/a with pressure, up to P = 8 GPa, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(a) (upper panel). A comparison between these results and those from ref. 2 is also shown (lower panel). We observe variations in c/a (with each P step) that are far more uniform than those in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref>, the points from this earlier study being 'scattered' about dashed curve (lower panel). We therefore argue that our measurements represent an improvement on these earlier studies. We argue likewise for CeCoIn 5 , however here we obtain at least some agreement with earlier work (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>, in that, in the range 0 &lt; P &lt; 15 GPa, c/a(P) is a single-peak function, with peak position between 3 and 5 GPa, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(b)</ref>, where (again) the results from the previous study (ref.</p><p>3) are reproduced, for comparison. In addition, we present in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b) (top-panel) previously unpublished values of c/a(P) for CeCoIn 5 for P &lt; 5 GPa (open-squares), obtained in an ID30 study carried out several years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These data, collected under similar experimental conditions to ours (i.e. powder sample quantity and PTM) are in excellent agreement with the trend we observe. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2(c</ref>) we show the 'compressibility curves' for each Ce 115 compound, i.e. the P dependence of V/V 0 (= (a 2 c)/(a 2 0 c 0 )). The fits are to a Birch-Murnaghan (B-M) form for the equation of state (EOS). The fitted value of Bulk modulus (B 0 ) for CeCoIn 5 is 76.1(14) GPa, in good agreement with that of 78.2(18) GPa previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, whereas our B 0 for CeRhIn 5 , at 85.4(11) GPa, is higher than the value of 78.4(2) GPa previously measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, as with the trends in c/a(P) for CeRhIn 5 , our measured values of V/V 0 (P) show less deviations ('scatter') about the fitting curve and we thus conclude that our B 0 (for CeRhIn 5 ) is more reliable than the value in ref. 2 (this also follows from the superior hydrostaticity which will have been achieved in our studies).</p><p>For PuCoGa5, we deduce that c/a(P) is, in the range 0 &lt; P &lt; 37 GPa, a function with a single minimum at position 12-13 GPa, as shown in upper panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. However, in the range 10-13 GPa we observe an anomalous behaviour (a 'relaxation' <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) in the c lattice parameter which results in the deviation of the (c/a) points (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(upper panel)) from the 'deduced' trend (solid line). We believe that this c parameter anomaly is associated to the known 'freezing' of silicon oil (PTM) seen to occur ~ 8 GPa <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. That such an effect is not observed in any of our experiments (using oil as PTM) on Ce 115s is, we believe, due to slight differences in the experimental conditions between the Ce and Pu 115 studies; the crystallites (powder grains) of PuCoGa5 were larger and more plate-like than those in the Ce 115 studies, and, in addition, were bound together by glue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The lower panel in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the corresponding compressibility curve for PuCoGa 5 . Again, we observe an anomaly at ~ 10 GPa, but this time it is a much weaker effect than that seen in c/a (at ~ 10 GPa, only two data points in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> (lower panel) deviate from the B 0 = 77(2) GPa fitting curve). This can be understood, as the unit-cell volume (V = a 2 c) is less sensitive to variations in c than the quantity c/a. Two B-M EOS fits are shown in the figure. The fit corresponding to the larger B 0 was made with data for P &lt; 10 GPa, only, whereas the second fit took into account the full presesure range. We believe that due to the anomaly in the c parameter, one cannot have confidence, quantitatively, in V(P) beyond 10 GPa (whereas, qualitatively, we may still conclude that c/a increases for P &gt; 13 GPa). Thus, we believe 89(6) GPa to be the more reliable deduction of B 0 in this system (this fit also gives a value of B' (at ~ 5) more typical of actinide intermetallic systems). (a) (b) (c) Fig. 3. c/a(P) (upper panel) and compressibility curve (lower panel) for PuCoGa 5 .</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we plot the derived trends (from the diffraction data) in c/a(P) for all compounds investigated [8], and compare these with the c/a(P) ('anticipated') which would be expected if, as suggested in ref. 1, T c (P) were correlated to changes in c/a occurring under pressure <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. From the disagreement with expectation, for all systems, we conclude the absence of such (simple) correlation.</p></div>
