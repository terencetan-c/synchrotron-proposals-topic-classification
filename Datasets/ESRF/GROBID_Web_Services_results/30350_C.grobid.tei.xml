<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This feasibility study is the basis for future EXAFS measurements to investigate the sorption of neptunium on kaolinite KGa-1b (Source Clays Repository). Several collaborating groups selected this kaolinite as reference clay for a broad range of investigations dealing with the interaction of actinides in the system clay, humic acid, and aquifer. During recent EXAFS measurements of uranium(VI) sorption onto kaolinite KGa-1b (see report ME-817), we found that this kaolinite contains traces of zirconium. The energy of the Zr K edge equals 17998 eV. Therefore, we expect a distortion of the Np L 3 -edge (17610 eV) EXAFS signal at this energy or at k approximately equal to 9.8 Å -1 . This experiment aimed at exploring the possibilities for avoiding severe distortions in the Np EXAFS signal without limiting the k range to 9.8 Å -1 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Two samples 1 and 2 with different amounts of neptunium(V) sorbed were prepared from a 1.8 mM Np(V) stock solution of Np-237. This stock solution had been purified from traces of Pu-239 and Pa-233. 200 mg kaolinite KGa-1b were suspended in 50 mL de-ionized water. The ionic strength was adjusted to 0.1 M NaClO 4 and the pH to 9.0. The system was open to air. After shaking these mixtures for 72 hours, aliquots of the Np(V) stock solution were added with immediate readjustment of the pH. The total neptunium concentration for samples 1 and 2 was 8•10 -6 and 2•10 -5 mol/L, respectively. After a contact time of 72 hours, the solid and liquid phases were separated by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for seven minutes. The neptunium uptake of samples 1 and 2 as measured by γ-spectroscopy was 300 and 510 ppm, respectively. The solid residue was loaded without drying into the EXAFS sample holder. The neptunium EXAFS spectra were measured in fluorescence mode using the new 13-element Ge solid-state detector of the ROBL radiochemistry hutch.</p><p>The following measurements were performed on these samples: 1) The Np Lα 1 radiation at 13.9 keV was recorded as a function of photon energy across the Np L 3 -edge EXAFS region using the single-channel analyzers (SCA's). The signal was corrected for detector dead time using the measured total count rates (ICR`s).</p><p>2) The same as in 1) but with a specially designed rubidium nitrate fluorescence filter placed between sample and Ge solid-state detector to reduce the contribution of the Zr Kα fluorescence at 15.8 keV to the ICR`s.</p><p>3) The EXAFS spectrum was measured at the Np L 2 edge (21600 eV) by setting the SCA's at 17.8 keV to record the Np Lβ 1 radiation.</p><p>The measurements showed that the rubidium filter is able to significantly reduce the contribution of the Zr Kα fluorescence to the ICR. However, the absorption of the Zr Kα fluorescence by the rubidium atoms increased the intensity of the Rb Kα fluorescence at 13.4 keV. Unfortunately, the Np Lα 1 radiation at 13.9 keV could not be separated from the Rb Kα fluorescence at 13.4 keV. Since both the Np and Rb X-ray emission lines were recorded in the SCA`s, the RbNO 3 filter enhanced the distortion of the Np L 3 -edge fluorescence signal. Therefore, the rubidium filter cannot be used to reduce the effect of the zirconium trace on the Np L 3 -edge EXAFS signal above 9.8 Å -1 .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the Np EXAFS spectra and the corresponding Fourier transforms of sample 1 (300 ppm Np) measured at the L 3 and L 2 edges. Seven sweeps at the Np L 2 edge and six sweeps at the L 3 edge were averaged. The useful k range at the L 3 edge was limited to k max equal 9.4 Å -1 due to the Zr K absorption edge. The Np L 2 -edge EXAFS signal could be recorded with good statistics up to k max equal 11.4 Å -1 . Therefore, it is preferable to record the Np EXAFS signal of the kaolinite samples at the Np L 2 edge.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the EXAFS structural parameters of sample 1 derived from the Np L 3 -and L 2 -edge k 3weighted EXAFS spectra. The detected neptunium coordination shells and bond distances are consistent with the formation of a Np(V) carbonato species at the kaolinite surface due to precipitation. A similar result was obtained for sample 2 (510 ppm, not shown here).</p><p>In conclusion, these test experiments showed that it is possible to study the sorption of neptunium onto kaolinite KGa-1b successfully using Np L 2 -edge EXAFS spectroscopy. With the new 13-element Ge detector, it is possible to study sorption samples with less than 300 ppm neptunium in the future by collecting more than seven sweeps per sample.  2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 Transform magnitude 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 r + ∆, Å 10 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 EXAFS ( chi(k)*k 3 ) 10 8 6 4 k, Å</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1Np L-edge k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra (left) and corresponding Fourier transforms (right) of 300 ppm Np(V) sorbed onto kaolinite at pH 9.0 under ambient conditions.
