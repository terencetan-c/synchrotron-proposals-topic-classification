<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In-situ electronic structure study of novel Li-ion batteries </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Li-ion batteries have been in the focus of substantial interest as power sources for portable telecommunication, IT and hybrid electric vehicles. In order to improve Li-ion battery technology further, understanding the electronic structure of novel battery materials, such as LiNiO 2 , is of fundamental importance. There are conflicting reports regarding the redox chemistry of Ni and the role of oxygen during battery cycling in LiNiO 2 based cathode materials. In some experiments the hole doping following lithium removal from the cathode during battery operation is observed to happen mostly on oxygen sites while in other experiments the charge compensation is observed to happen trough further oxidation of the transition metal ions.</p><p>This experiment aimed to answer these discrepancies by measuring the evolution of Non-Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (NRIXS) spectra of O in a series of Li x Ni 0.85 Co 0.15 O 5 samples with a varying degree of Lithium content x. In NRIXS, by tuning the energy transfer over the core electron binding energies, an equivalent of conventional inner shell absorption spectrum can be measured. In this experiment we tuned the energy transfer over oxygen 1s binding energy and thus we were able to measure the O K-edge absorption spectra using hard x-rays, making this a bulk sensitive experiment.</p><p>Two incidents, however, prevented us from reaching the full objectives of the experiment. After getting the samples aligned on Friday, 10 th of May, we were able to measure NRIXS spectrum from one LiNi 0.85 Co 0.15 O 5 sample before the malfunction of the storage ring control computers on the night of Friday, due to the sabotage in the control room and followed by a 2-day shutdown, prevented the further use of the beamline. Secondly, we experienced severe difficulties with getting the samples delivered to ESRF on time. The French shipping company Ziegler was unable to deliver the samples by the start of the experiment due to delays caused by the US shipping company used by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, from where the samples originated, and due to problems with the French customs. The bank holiday on Thursday, 9 th of May, caused further delays in the delivery. The total delivery time turned out to be 10 days instead of three days promised by the shipping company, causing altogether a delay of several shifts in starting the experiment. However, if we had been able to proceed normally with the experiment till the end of the allocated beam time, we would have been able to achieve the objectives of the experiment despite the sample delivery problems.</p><p>The obtained NRIXS data from LiNi 0.85 Co 0.15 O sample, with energy transfer corresponding to O 1s binding energies, is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. together with O K-edge absorption spectra of some Li oxycompounds recorded using soft x-rays. The data clearly shows that meaningful results are obtainable with the used experimental technique at ID 16. Further analysis of the data is currently under work.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize, that during the experiment we have gained expertise on several complicated technical issues. The samples require inert gas atmosphere and during the conducted experiment we have been able test and improve the procedures needed for sample preparation, transportation to the beamline and manipulations at the experimental station under the required special conditions. Further, we have gained information on the expected count rates and on the radiation damage to the samples. We expect this information to very valuable in continuing this experiment in the future.</p><p>Notwithstanding the sample delivery problems we were able to use the first half of the allocated beam time efficiently for scientific work after being granted by the beamline staff a permission to work on a MgB 2 sample using NRIXS. The Helsinki group had previously done experiments on this sample on ESRF beamline ID15 and the unexpected opportunity to further study the sample has supported the efforts to understand the properties of this compound.</p><p>We conducted investigations i) on the collective charge excitations of the MgB 2 system as evidenced by momentum transfer dependant dispersion of plasmon like excitations at few eV energy transfer range, and ii) on the free electronic states of Boron by recording NRIXS spectra at energy transfers corresponding to boron Kshell energy at varying momentum transfers to the electronic system.</p><p>Although the MgB 2 investigation was planned to be only a preliminary one, the obtained data seems to be of high enough quality to merit publication. Currently, a paper on the results of experiment ii) is under preparation and the results of experiment i) are being analyzed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Aleksi Mattila*, Szabolcs Galambosi*, Keijo Hämäläinen* Division of X-ray Physics, Department of Physical Sciences, P.O.Box 64, FIN-00014 University of Helsinki, Finland Mahalingam Balasubramanian, Chi-Chang Kao Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton NY 11973, USA Gyorgy Vanko* ESRF, BP 220, F-38043 Grenoble cedex, France</figDesc></figure>
