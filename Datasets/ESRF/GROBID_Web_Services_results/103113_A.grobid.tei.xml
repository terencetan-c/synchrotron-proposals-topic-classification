<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proposal of experiment CH-6536, "Exploring flexibility of the new Mn(III)-based MOF", aimed at solving the structure of a series of new Mn(III)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with an expected flexible structure, as well as investigating their guest sorption properties. The series of new MOFs is related to the wellknown MIL-53, which possesses a breathing behaviour. The originality of our series of MOFs, apart from the fact that it is based on Mn III metal centres, is that it has alkoxy bridging linkers. Indeed, the vast majority of MIL-53 MOFs possesses inorganic OH-bridging linkers, or more rarely F- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is known that both, the nature of the metal centres and of the bridging linkers have an important influence on the breathing behaviour of MIL-53. The experiment aimed at solving the structure of several of those MOFs with structural modifications (multivariate derivatives with metal or linker substitutions and derivatives obtained through synthesis with extended linkers or in different solvents) with the help of variable-temperature X-ray synchrotron radiation diffraction experiments, as collecting very good quality diffraction data is mandatory to achieve this goal. Furthermore, adsorption of guests and possible flexibility of the structure of the new MOFs was investigated with respect to various solvents and gasses, including N2O and CO2.</p><p>The beamtime was sufficient for running all the planned experiments, and experiments on some supplementary samples were performed during the last shifts of the experiment. This included thermodiffraction on various MOF samples to evaluate their activation process, gas sorption in the Mg-gallate (N2O and CO2) MOF, as well as a porous dodecaborate ((Me4N)2B12H12) (CO2), single scan XRD and fast thermodiffraction experiments of a few samples of materials for hydrogen storage and composite materials for solid-state electrolytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results -Mn(III) MOFs</head><p>Thermodiffraction data of a high-quality Mn(III)-based terephthalate obtained in methanol enabled us to refine its structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Unfortunately, the experiments showed that this MOF does not possess any detectable flexible behavior upon exposure to solvents or CO2. Multivariate derivatives of this MOF, obtained by direct synthesis involving partial substitution of either the Mn(III) metal center metal (using 10 or 20 mol% of Cr III , Fe III or Al III ) or the linker (using variable amounts of 2-nitroterephthalate), were analyzed by thermodiffraction to detect eventual thermally-induced flexibility. Indeed, it has previously been shown that such a strategy can potentially significantly impact the flexible behavior of MOFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The multivariate samples with metal substitution did not reveal any substantial peak shifts upon heating, indicating the absence of flexible behaviour. However, the samples with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mol% substitution by 2-nitroterephthalate showed surprinsing results. Whereas the crystallinity of those samples has been toroughly checked in our lab one week before the experiment and showed a single phase of the MOF with the expected topology, splitting of diffraction peaks has been observed on the data recorded at SNBL (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. B.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. PXRD patterns of the multivariate derivatives of the MIL-53-like Mn(III)-based MOF with increasing amounts of 2-nitroterephthalate substitution (for bottom to top: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mol% nitro derivative used for the synthesis). The synchrotron data (A.) reveals peak splitting, which was undetectable by measurements performed in our lab (B.). Peak shifting is revealing gradual pore opening with increasing amounts of -NO2 functions.</p><p>Additionnaly, peak shifting is observed, which, according to a preliminary data treatment, corresponds to an increase in the b parameter and a decrease of the β angle of the unit cell. This indicates that the pores of the MOF gradually open with increasing amounts of nitro functions on the linkers. Further refinement of the data is however needed to evaluate the origin of the peak splitting. The structure with the largest pore opening (i.e. using 60 mol% of 2-nitroterephthalate for linker substitution) has been tested for potential flexibility by sorption of CO2, but unfortunately no significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed during this experiment, indicating no or only very low uptake of the gas, with no associated structural change. Similarly,</p><p>3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Normalized intensity 2θ (°) 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Normaized intensity 2θ (°)</p><p>no structural change was observed upon exposure to dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol or dimethylsufoxide (DMSO).</p><p>A derivative of the Mn(III)-based MOF with naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate as and extended linker was also synthesized in methanol. A thermodiffraction experiment showed that the obtained MOF is a new framework with is similar to the previously described MIL-69 (which has previously been reported only with Al, Ga and V metal centers) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Thermodiffraction of this sample however does not reveal any siginificant change in diffraction patterns before decomposition, indicating that this MOF does not demonstrate any flexible behavior upon thermal stimulus. This observation is however not surprising as it is in accordance with the properties of the previously decribed MIL-69 derivatives. A terephthalate Mn(III)-based MOF was also obtained by sustituting methanol by ethanol for the synthesis, with the aim to exchange the bridging -OMe groups by -OEt. This led to a MOF with a diffraction pattern that is significantly different from the MIL-53-type MOF that was obtained in methanol. Preliminary data treatment allowed to solve the unprecedented structure of this MOF, which shows unidimensional porous channels with a unique spatial arrangement of Mn atoms in the chain-like secondary building unit composing the framework, significantly different from the one in MIL-53 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</p><p>A. B. C. This new MOF shows interesting behaviour upon exposure to various solvents molecules, as indicated by the thermodiffraction data collected on samples upon exposure to acetone, dichloromethane, DMF, DMSO, ethanol and acetonitrile. Surprisingly, exposure to DMF leads to amorphization of the structure, which was shown to be perfectly reversible upon exchange with ethanol, leading to recovery of a highly cristalline phase of the structure displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. This might be an example of recently described "frustrated flexibility" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, as the reversibility observed during the experiments indicates that the connectivity, and thus the functionality, of the framework is maintained although cristallinity decreases. Upon charging with DMSO, the sample shows the presence of three different cristalline phases upon heating before decomposition (structures still to be solved), indicating a complex breating process upon thermally-induced DMSO guest removal. Trials of charging CO2 into the structure were shown unsucessful, as no significant changes were observed using low pressure (0.5 bar) and amorphization occurred upon a test under higher pressure (40 bar). However, this might be due to inefficient activation of the MOF due to the fact that its properties are not yet fully understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary results (investigation of other samples taking advantage of remaining beam time)</head><p>Given the efficiency with which the experiments were performed, advantage of remaining beam time (last two shifts) has been taken to study several other interesting systems. This includes several MOFs, porous materials, hydrogen storage materials and composites for solid-state electrolyte applications.</p><p>Magnesium gallate is a MOF that is known for its interaction with several gases, and has been shown particularly useful for adsorption of CO2, due to the particular S-shaped isotherms occuring during sorption of this gas in this particular framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Although this MOF has been studied with various gases and shows the best affinity with CO2, no in situ structural studies have been performed on this framework up to now. Furthermore, in our lab we showed, by measuring gas sorption isotherms, that this MOF also possesses a very good interaction with N2O, which is a greenhouse gas with a heat trapping ability 265 times higher than CO2 and is currently the atmospheric gas that is the most implicated in destruction of the ozone layer . During our beam time, we were able to follow the thermally-induced activation process of this MOF under atmospheric pressure and under vacuum. Our results indicates that, unlike previously suggested by ex-situ measurements, activation of the framework to the dehydrated phase can be performed without applying vacuum (280°C under air), and the structural thermal stability of Mg gallate was shown to be particularly high. Thermodiffraction under CO2 and N2O loading was performed to determine the nature of the adsorption sites with both gases. The (high quality) data obtained during these experiments is currently being processed and refined.</p><p>A small series of other microporous MOFs was charaterized by thermodiffraction under air to determine their structural thermal stability, as thermogravimetric analysis of the measured samples does not enable this due to difficult guest removal. The knowledge of the thermal stability of the measured samples will enable the optimization of activation processes for hydrogen storage purposes.</p><p>Thermodiffraction data of a (rare case of) porous cocrystal was also recorded, to complement laboratory data obtained on a single crystal. The aim of this experiment was to determine the structural integrity of the sample under the conditions used in the lab for gas sorption, to elucidate remaining questions about the properties of this sample.</p><p>A porous dodecaborate, namely (Me4N)2B12H12, was recently obtained by us and revealed the presence of isolated pores. Recent experiments showed that, altough those pores are isolated one from another, gas sorption is possible (as demonstrated by sorption isotherms). Therefore, this material was subjected to an in situ experiment consisting of CO2 loading under a fixed pressure and temperature. The results showed an important change in diffraction patterns upon exposure to the gas, which is promising in further understanding of the sorption processes in this material.</p><p>Four samples of candidate solid-state chemical hydrogen storage materials were also characterized by thermodiffraction. This will enable to evaluate the structure of intermediates that are formed during the dehydrogenation of the studied solids.</p><p>A last series of samples, composed of zeolites impregnated with hydrides (solid-state electrolytes materials) was measured by thermodiffraction. This enabled to determine the thermal stability of those composites.</p><p>We also measured nice single crystals data on two complicated cases within our collobaration with UNamur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Perspectives</head><p>The experiments enabled the following about the Mn(III)-based MOFs:</p><p>-The structure of the terephthalate-based MOF obtained in methanol could be refined on a high quality sample; -We showed that the terepthalate-based MOF obtained in methanol and its multivariate derivatives are rare examples of MIL-53 analogues that do not demonstrate any breathing behaviour upon heating, exposure to gases or solvents; -Partial substitution of terephthalate by 2-nitro terephthalate in the Mn(III)-based MIL-53 derivative leads to partial pore opening; -A new MIL-69 type MOF has been obtained with Mn(III) as metals center, but presents no flexibility upon heating; -The structure of a new Mn(III) MOF composed of terephthalate units was obtained and its reversible (frustrated) flexible behavior was demonstrated by thermodiffraction data.</p><p>The above described results are currently being complemented with supplementary analyses to prepare a manuscript for publication. Further in-depth interpretation of the obtained diffraction data will also be performed to finalise the refinement and localise light elements in the pores, including guests and alkoxy groups which may have been overlooked by the preliminary data treatment (for example in the MIL-69 derivatives, since bridging -OMe groups were found in the MIL-53 derivative and synthesis conditions where highly similar for both MOFs). Further gas loading experiments on the flexible terephtahalte Mn(III) MOF obtained in ethanol will be performed in our lab to evaluate the potential functional porosity of the material upon gas exposure, despite loss of cristallinity.</p><p>Data obtained during the other experiments will also be subject of upcoming publications, dealing with among other things:</p><p>-The activation process and sorption mechanisms of CO2 and N2O in Mg gallate; -The synthesis and porous properties of a rare case of porous cocrystal; -The synthesis and gas sorption properties of (Me4N)2B12H12; -The dehydrogenation intermediates of new hydrogen storage materials; -The structural stability of solid-state electrolytes based on zeolite-hydride composites</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
