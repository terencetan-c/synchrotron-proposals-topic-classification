<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Russian Grant Proposal: "Structural characterization of novel advanced materials on high-resolution synchrotron powder diffractometer ID22".</p><p>In the framework of experiment MA-3313 in ESRF at beamline ID22, seven scientists from Moscow (Russian Federation), namely, Dr. Vladimir Chernyshev, Dr. Anna Tursina, Dr. Nadezhda Kurochkina, Dr. Sergei Nesterenko, Dr. Dmitry Albov and post-graduate student Elena Marushina delivered the powder samples of 56 compounds for the measurements. The samples were loaded into quartz and borosilicate capillaries of 0.5 -1.0 mm diameter. During 9 shifts (72 h) all the samples were measured in the 2 ranges 0 -10, 0 -20, 0 -25 or 0 -35 o . Three MOF samples were measured in the CO 2 flow at RT and P = 10 bar. One zeolite sample (CsY) was measured in the N 2 flow at P = 10 bar and different temperatures from the range 25 -350 o C. One ternary intermetallic sample (CePt 2 Al 2 ) was also measured at different temperatures in the range 25 -350 o C. Sample of Zr(W x , Mo 1-x ) 2 O 8 with negative thermal expansion coefficient was measured in the temperature range 25 -500 o C. In the total, 101 data sets were collected. The X-ray wavelength used was 0.399962(4) Å. Table 1 contains the full list of the measured patterns (see Appendix). Samples 4 -17, 30, 31 -54 and 52 -56 are zeolites. Samples 1 -3 and 18 are MOFs. Samples 19 -29 are ternary intermetallics. Samples 36 -49 are -substituted porphyrins. Samples 32 -35 are Covalent Organic Frameworks. Samples 50 and 51 are biologically active organic compounds. Sample 57 is NTE material, Zr(W x , Mo 1-x ) 2 O 8 .</p><p>All measured patterns, excluding amorphous and decomposed (3 patterns in total), will be used in subsequent structural analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, we estimate these 9 shifts of experimental work as extremely fruitful (as usual for ID22 high-resolution station) and thank the ID22 staff for the kind and helpful assistance.</p><p>Dr. V.V. Chernyshev M.V. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Lomonosov Moscow State UniversityList of the patterns measured in experiment MA-3313, session 3.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Appendix.</cell></row></table></figure>
