<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the density of Ca, Mg and Sr and the stacked mapping of the three elements in a sample taken from the calcareous alga Jania sp. As expected, Ca is dispersed throughout the triple junctions and their connecting bridge, presenting higher intensity deeper in the porous wall (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">A</ref>). Mg mapping resulted in an even dispersion throughout the sample as well, which further expands to the void (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>). Mg is a small atom resulting in highly energetic x-rays with low-distance dispersion, as a result, the Mg dispersion might not be accurate, explaining its appearance in the void. Sr mapping revealed an interesting result, presenting layered structure in the sample. (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">C</ref>). In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, D the stacked image can be seen, it reveals the intensity differences between the different elements, where Ca is the dominant, and further emphasizes the "leaking" of the Mg signal. Similar results were observed with the O.wendetti optical lens as can be depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p><p>Both Ca and Mg appear to be evenly dispersed throughout the optical lens (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">A-B</ref>). While for Ca this is the expected result, previous work done by our group revealed layered structures throughout the lens composed of high-Mg calcite inclusions; which contradicts the received results. The aforementioned explanation is valid for this case as well, explaining the even Mg dispersion in the optical lens and its appearance in the carbon coating layer. Sr mapping revealed an interesting result, similar to what was seen in the Jania sp. , a layered structure in the optical lens can be seen which was previously undetectable using various characterization methods. (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, <ref type="figure">C</ref>). in figure 2, D the stacked image can be seen, revealing the intensity differences between the different elements, where Ca is the dominant element, the stacked image emphasizes the previously described "leakage" of Mg atoms signals in the carbon coating layer.</p><p>XRF measurements uncovered the presence of Sr atoms. While presence of Sr as replacement to Ca atoms is known in biomineralization, the surprising distribution both in the Jania sp. and in the O. wendetti optical lens was previously unknown and went undetected until now. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Boaz Pokroy, Technion -Israel Institute of Technology Department of Materials Engineering Prof. Paul Zaslansky, Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin</figDesc></figure>
