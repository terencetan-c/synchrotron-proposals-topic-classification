<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Native and PCMBS derivative data sets were collected for a Bgll/l7mer complex at wavelengths of 1.00911 and 1.00465A respectively. The derivative data has not been processed but the native data are good to 2.24A In addition, 2.24A native and PCMBS derivative data sets were collected for a Bgll/l8mer complex at wavelengths of 1.00917 and 1.00465A respectively.</p><p>In total, we collected seven complete Bgll/DNA complex data sets during our beam time on BM14 six of which are useful and are being used in ongoing structural determinations.</p><p>Native, PCMBS and hexachloro osmate derivative data sets were collected for the Bg11/17mer complex at wavelengths of 0.919, 0.919 and 1.14A</p><p>The 224 native data have an RV of 0.055 for all data (0.078 in the last resolution shell), the 23A PCMBS data have an R-of 0.039 for all data (0.107 in the last resolution shell) and the 28A hexachloro osmate data have an R-of 0.031 for all data (0.054 in the last resolution shell).</p><p>23A data sets were also collected for three brominated Bg11/17mer complexes at a wavelength of 0.919A These data have R-0.034,0.038,0.033 for all data (0.065, 0.081, 0.067 in the last resolution shell respectively).</p><p>A hexachloro osmate derivative data set was collected for the Bgll/l8mer complex at a wavelength of 1.14x, but these data have not been processed.</p><p>The useful data sets have been incorporated into the MIRAS phase calculation using the program SHARP, resulting in a superb electron density map for the Bgli/17mer complex. A model has been built, including the DNA and all but one residue of the protein and is currntly being refined.</p><p>We are pleased with the data collected during this beam time and would like to thank the beam line staff, in particular Eric Fanchon and Andy Thompson, for their assistance.</p></div>		</body>
