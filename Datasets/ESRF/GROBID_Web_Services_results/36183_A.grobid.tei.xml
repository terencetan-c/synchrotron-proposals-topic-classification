<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Accurate knowledge of the density of lunar materials at high pressures and temperatures is critical for models of the dynamic evolution of the interior of the Moon. Lunar silicate magma density variations during crystallisation of a lunar magma ocean are particularly important, as formation of both plagioclase-rich highland rocks and mare basalts are ultimately linked to density differences between lunar magma and co-existing minerals. To date, densities of lunar melts have only been determined using indirect quench methods <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Here we introduce a X-ray absorption technique, initially developed by <ref type="bibr">Katayama [3]</ref> for work on metallic melts, to determine the density of silicate magma in situ. Preliminary density measurement experiments using a synthetic equivalent of Apollo 14 black glass <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, performed during beamtime HD151, are presented here along with subsequent detailed microscopic analysis of recovered samples. Our results show that this technique can indeed be used to obtain in situ silicate magma densities. We also provide details of several minor adjustments to the experimental procedures that will significantly improve our ability to expand the lunar magma density database to wider pressure, temperature and compositional ranges in future experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental techniques:</head><p>Eight in situ experiments were conducted at beamline ID 27, using X-ray absorption in the toroidal Paris-Edinburgh cell. Starting material was packed in CVD diamond cylinders (inner diameter: 0.5 mm) with graphite end caps. Diamond cylinders, chosen because it is a low absoring, incompressible material, were surrounded by other low-Z materials (hexagonal boron nitride sleeves, graphite furnace and boron epoxy pressure medium) to maximise X-ray throughput (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, <ref type="figure">[5]</ref>).</p><p>Samples were first pressurized followed by stepwise heating. During pressurisation and heating, angledispersive X-ray diffraction patterns of both samples and calibrants were obtained. A monochromatic beam (33 KeV, I k-edge, = 0.3738 Å for the 1 st experiment and 20 KeV, Mo k-edge, = 0.6199 Å for experiments 2-8). Pressure-temperature conditions were calculated offline by combining X-ray diffraction measurements of the unit-cell volumes of hBN, MgO, and/or Pt calibrants with equation-of-state parameters. The crystalline vs. molten state of the sample was assessed by monitoring angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction patterns. An example of the evolution of diffraction patterns during temperature increase is shown in the left panel of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. After the disappearance of sample diffraction peaks and appearance of the diffuse scattering signal of the liquid, X-ray absorption across the sample was measured (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, right panel). Pressuretemperature conditions were determined from the unit-cell volumes of the internal calibrants using the equations of state of <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>To calculate the density of the molten black glass, the Beer-Lambert law was fit to the near-parabolic absorption scans <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, giving values for the product liq liq . The constant mass absorption coefficient liq was derived at room conditions, from a free standing sample, using the calculated density of the sample at room conditions [9-12], 3.78 g/cm 3 . Major element compositions of selected recovered run products were obtained using a JEOL JXA 8800M electron microprobe at the VU University Amsterdam. The boron content of selected run products was measured on Ag-coated samples at IOM (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque).</p><p>Results: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarises the pressure-temperature conditions for experiments in which X-ray diffraction patterns indicated total melting had occurred, and shows sample densities calculated from fits to absorption scans. The uncertainty in liq introduces an error of + 0.10 g/cm 3 in the determination of these density values. Experimental temperatures are compared to liquidus temperatures of Apollo 14 black glass at the corresponding sample pressure [4].  Discussion: Our results highlight several solvable experimental problems. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> illustrates two main issues. First, although the eventual disappearance of sample diffraction peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) suggested all samples reached superliquidus conditions, in several experiments (e.g. 6, 7) subsequent PT calibrant calculations indicate subliquidus conditions when compared with the published liquidus of black glass <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.  Microprobe glass totals for these samples range from 88 to 98 wt%. Subsequent analyses showed these samples were contaminated with up to 10 wt% of B 2 O 3 , derived from the hBN sleeves surrounding the diamond cylinder and graphite end caps. The lowering of the sample liquidus by addition of the light element B explains (1) why fully molten samples were formed at conditions far below the well-constrained black glass liquidus (2) why measured densities are significantly below previously published values from quench experiments. The unexpectedly low densities measured for experiment 5 (a sample that was not recovered) must also be a result of such B contamination. Clearly B contamination is a bigger problem in silicate magma density measurements than in the metal density measurements that our setup was successfully used for in the past. A simple remedy for this problem is to enlarge the graphite end caps that separate sample from hBN (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) in future experiments. Second, several run products contain non-trivial amounts of rounded ilmenite crystals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). These were formed in the subliquidus field during heating of the samples. Ostensibly dissolution of these crystals is slow on the timescale of these synchrotron experiments (0.5-3 hrs, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In future experiments, time spent at subliquidus temperatures should be minimised to prevent crystal nucleation and growth.</p><p>In experiment 8 (right panel Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) these problems were absent. Experiment 8-2 in particular has calculated PT conditions above the published liquidus, the recovered sample is free of ilmenite, and there is no evidence for B contamination (microprobe total 100.5 wt%). The measured density in this case should reflect a true in situ magma density value. The calculated density value of 8-2 (3.29 g/cm 3 ) lies within error of the previously reported quench technique at very similar P-T conditions (3.30 g/cm 3 ) [1]. This proves that our technique is suitable for in situ measurements of silicate magma density.</p><p>A final issue is the use of multiple calibrants to constrain both pressure and temperature in the experiments. Pressure-temperature conditions were derived from simultaneous volume determination for the calibrants, using the equations of state of BN and Pt or BN and MgO. The main problem here was the uncertainty of the equations of states themselves. Using the average literature values <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> for MgO, the difference between BN-Pt and BN-MgO stayed smallest, with a maximum of 300 K and 0.4 GPa difference.</p><p>In future experiments we strongly advise using a thermocouple to measure sample temperatures. This will minimise the uncertainty in pressure-temperature conditions, and will avoid having to depend completely on equations of state for both P and T. Thermocouples have been used in conjunction with this assembly in the past, so this adjustment will not require additional development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and outlook:</head><p>We have successfully obtained the first in situ density measurements of lunar silicate magma. In a next set of experiments the contamination and disequilibrium effects we identiefied can easily be solved by slightly adjusting the cell assembly and heating trajectory, and by adding a thermocouple to the assembly. Our study highlights the necessity of sample recovery and characterization after in situ studies to exclude contamination issues that cannot be identified from in situ observations.</p><p>A follow-up study to complete our data set of lunar magma densities is highly anticipated. The results presented here have put us in pole position to do so.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Left panel: Typical sequence of X-ray diffraction spectra upon progressive heating, showing disappearance of sample mineral reflections.
