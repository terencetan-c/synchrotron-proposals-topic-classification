Crist.-CNRS Grenoble KSARJ Younal LCMI -CNRS Grenoble TOUZAIN Philippe LEPMI -INPG Grenoble</p><p>Report:</p><p>The proposal concerned crystal chemistry of rare earths-doped Cbo fullerene and its links to the magnetic properties of these phases.</p><p>X-ray difTi-action measurements at room temperature were performed on 6 samples of nominal compositions M&amp;j and MnC6o (M = Sm, Eu, Yb). A Debye-Scherrer setting (highly air sensitive samples) equipped with a multianalyser system and a monochromatic beam h = 0.35827 A (nearly complete suppression of the incident beam absorption by the heavy element) were used. The high resolution powder difiaction patterns obtained display peak shapes whose FWHM -0.04", i.e. efficiencient reflection discrimination among the very strong peak density observed in some cases due to important cell parameters (238 A for the M_tCm phases studied).</p><p>The structural analysis has revealed a similar structure for all phases of the M&amp;60 type. The minimized peak overlap allowed for an invalidation of some structural features earlier proposed for a phase Yb&amp; (x in the vicinity of 3) on the basis of law resolution data, i.e. no orthorhombic distortion was clearly evidenced (Pa3 retained).</p><p>The most surprising feature is the probable decrease of the initial icosahedral symmetry of the fullerene molecule, responsible for the unusual peak shape observed (this phenomenon could be confirmed recently by Raman spectroscopy). The short carbon-metal distances systematically determined indicate a partial covalence trend, with consequences for the magnetic properties of the Eu-doped phases.</p><p>The higher metal concentration M&amp;O phases are characterized by a transition towards BCC symmetry. The slight carbon-metal orbitals hybridization also observed in these compounds allowed to invoke, for the first time in &amp;-based compounds, a spin polarization mechanism via superexange in EUgC60.</p><p>N.B.: Due to an incessant evolution of the subject from the proposal deposit to the experiments realization dates, the samples nature and priority may have changed compared to the initial program.</p></div>		</body>
