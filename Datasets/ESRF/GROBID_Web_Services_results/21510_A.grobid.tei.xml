<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>§ block allocation for LS1986 and SC924, separate report for SC924 Report. Haloperoxidases catalyse the formation of hypohaleous acids. They play a role in anti-bacterial medication [1,2]. To gain deeper insight into the catalytic mechanism, the binding of bromide in a vanadatedependent peroxidase (bromoperoxidase, BP) was investigated using XAS at the vanadium K-edge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Synthetic models for the mono-vanadium metal site in bromoperoxidases were investigated. XANES and EXAFS spectra (scan range 5300-6500 eV) of ten different vanadium model compounds (powder samples) containing either V(IV) or V(IV) oxidation states and bound bromide at distances ranging between 3 Å and &gt; 6 Å from vanadium were measured at room temperature. XAS spectra were collected in absorption and fluorescence modes (using a photodiode as detector in the latter case).</p><p>On bromoperoxidase samples from Ascophyllum nodosum XAS measurements were performed on frozen solutions (~ 1 mM vanadium) <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Spectra were collected on samples containing vanadium-to-bromide (Br) concentration ratios of 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:3 and on a sample containing iodate (I) instead of Br (V:I = 1:3). Spectra were measured at 20 K in fluorescence mode using an energy-resolving multi-element detector. Due to the presence of trace amounts of cerium in the Kapton tape used for the windows of the sample holders (giving rise to Cer L-edge signals), the analysis of EXAFS spectra of enzyme samples at the V K-edge was limited to an upper energy of 5720 eV. For energy calibration the simultaneously recorded absorption spectrum of a vanadium metal foil was used.</p><p>The following results have been obtained:</p><p>(1) Good quality EXAFS spectra of ten vanadium model compounds have been measured. Pronounced differences in the shapes and positions of the vanadium K-edge are observed, depending on the coordination and oxidation state of the V-atom (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The bound Br-atom can be detected in the EXAFS spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) up to a distance of ~5.5 Å from vanadium.</p><p>(2) XANES spectra of the bromoperoxidase differ from the ones of all studied model compounds, pointing to a different coordination of vanadium in the enzyme. The XANES spectra reveal only minor changes upon the addition of Br or I to the samples (not shown). In the EXAFS spectra minor changes were detected at reduced distances close to 3.2 Å (not shown). Comparison of the Fourier-transforms of EXAFS spectra calculated over the same limited energy range (20-5720 eV above E 0 ) for vanadium model compounds and enzyme samples (not documented) and preliminary simulations revealed that, if Br (or I) is bound to the enzyme, it is bound at a distances of about 3.7 Å to the vanadium atom, in line with previous results obtained by XAS at the Br K-edge <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary and Conclusions.</head><p>(1) High-quality XANES and EXAFS spectra have been collected for ten synthetic compounds which model the potential ligand environment of vanadium in the enzyme. The thus obtained "library" of spectra is needed for the comparative analysis of XANES spectra of the enzyme as well as for a realistic assessment of the information content of the EXAFS spectra of the bromoperoxidase.</p><p>(2) For the enzyme system, we find that the substrate (Br or I) is not directly coordinated to the active-site vanadium. In conjunction with XAS data previously collected at the bromine K-edge, the EXAFS results points towards Br-binding at an amino acid residue resulting in a V-Br distance of about 3.7 Å. However, due to unforeseen experimental problems (cerium contaminations), evaluation of EXAFS was only possible in a limited k-range. Therefore, the obtained results do not represent unambiguous proof for Br-binding at a distance of 3.7 Å to the vanadium of the active site.</p><p>A publication on the obtained results is in preparation.</p><p>1.
