<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of this experiment was to study the dynamics of nanoparticles confined between the lamellae of liquid crystalline lamellar phases. We had chosen three different systems of doped lamellar phases: a. Goethite nanoparticles in a swollen C 12 EO 5 lamellar phase, b. Silica nanoparticles in a swollen C 12 EO 5 lamellar phase, c. Polyoxometalate anions in a C 12 EO 4 lamellar phase.</p><p>The lamellar phases were sucked into flat optical capillaries of 50µm thickness (with 50µm glass walls). The phase was aligned macroscopically with the lamellae parallel to the face of the capillary. We expected to study both the diffusion of particles parallel to the lamellae with the beam perpendicular to the capillary or the dynamics of the lamellae in reflectivity.</p><p>In order to avoid beam damage to the samples we chose to work at 12 keV, hoping that the beam would interact less with the lamellar phase. After the first day of measurements we were still facing beam damage problems so for the rest of the experiment we were working at 8 keV which has the benefit of increased flux and coherence. However, in lamellar phases the signal was disturbed by the texture fluctuations under the beam and could not be reasonably analysed. Thus, we switched to a system that proved to be more robust, namely free suspensions of goethite nanoparticles in water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goethite suspensions</head><p>The goethite nanoparticles<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> are rodlike and polydisperse, with an average size of 150×25×10 nm 3 . They also have interesting magnetic properties: when subjected to a magnetic field, they align themselves either parallel to the field (for B&lt;250 mT) or perpendicular to it at higher field values. At concentrations above 8.5 vol%, the suspensions go through a phase transition to a nematic phase.</p><p>The samples that we used were two isotropic goethite suspensions at 4% and 7.3% volume fractions and a nematic goethite supension (at 8.5 vol%). The measurements were done either in the absence or the presence of a magnetic field that was applied perpendicularly to the beam. The strong magnetic field aligned the particles perpendicularly to the field, so their X-ray signal was concentrated along the direction of B. The measurements were also performed along this direction.</p><p>For each sample, a series of intensity autocorrelation functions g(t) was obtained at different q values. After normalization by the autocorrelation signal of the monitor, g(t) was fitted with a stretched exponential function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 ] ) [exp( 1 ) ( β t A t g Ω - + =</formula><p>, where the relaxation rate Ω yields the diffusion coefficient D via:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">2 Dq = Ω</formula><p>. A representative fit obtained this way is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>From plots of Ω against q 2 , we obtained the diffusion coefficient for different samples; the corresponding values are given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>The dispersion relations obtained for the first two samples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (left). The solid triangles are the results obtained in the absence of the magnetic field, while the open dots were measured on the same suspension in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Clearly, the presence of the field slows down the dynamics of the particles. This effect is still in need of an explanation. Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Values of the diffusion coefficient for all samples.</p><p>In the nematic phase, the strong interparticle interactions give rise to a correlation peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, right). We were able to measure the diffusion constant (in the direction perpendicular to the director) at the position of the peak, for q values substantially higher than those accessible to DLS measurements. However, we were reaching the limits of the experimental resolution, so that the variation of D(q) around its average value cannot be interpreted. In conclusion, goethite nanorods have proven to be a very promising system for studying the dynamics of colloidal suspensions of anisotropic particles. In the isotropic phase, the diffusion coefficient could be measured, with and without an applied magnetic field. The magnetic field slows down the diffusion noticeably. This effect deserves a more systematic investigation.</p><p>In the nematic phase, we were able to measure the diffusion coefficient up to q values corresponding to the correlation peak due to interparticle interactions. Although the values of D(q) presented here are quite scattered, the precision can be greatly improved by slowing down the dynamics by adding glycerol to the suspensions and/or cooling down the samples. Thus, the "mesoscopic" collective dynamics of the nematic phase can be probed.</p></div>
