<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FLOW CHART:</head><p>Objectives (from proposal): The idea of producing a crystalline alloy with good properties based on a heavy mix of elements was completely new and pushed the boundaries of properties understanding beyond what was known so far from one-and two-element based alloys, leading to the discovery of High Entropy Alloys (HEA). A general lack of experimental data on the crystal structure and local distortions in HEA -all factors considered crucial for the understanding of mechanical properties -emerges from the latest reviews. This project plans to tackle directly some of these aspects: a bcc alloy, so-called Senkov alloy based on Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta-Hf elements, and its precursors, will be investigated by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The Senkov alloy was chosen because it is the most studied in literature from the mechanical properties point of view, but detailed structural information at the atomic scale are still missing. The results will be then related to i) mechanical properties to be measured on the same compounds and integrated with the literature, and ii) on-going crystal structure investigation on similar hcp-based and fcc-based high entropy alloys.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Report</head><p>Five different edges Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf and Ta have been measured for reference foils, several reference compounds such as the ternary TiZrHf, TiNbHf, a quaternary MoNbTaW, an hcp based Al15Sc10Ti25Zr25Hf25, and the main compound -also known as Senkov alloy -, TiZrHfNbTa. Some of the Fourier-transformed spectra are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The evident features arising from this experiment is the low signal amplitude especially for the TiZrHfNbTa alloy, indicating a high degree of disorder, which is in line with the available literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Normalized linear absorption coefficient χ, χ(R) as a function of the radial distance from the absorber. Data are stacked from bottom to top with decreasing alloy complexity (i.e. number of elements) for better visualization.

<div><p>All measurements went as planned. We did not encounter any relevant problems and we could maintain the expectations collecting data of very good quality. At present we are analyzing and comparing the data taken at LISA beamline with data on the similar specimens collected previously at LISA as well, PHOENIX (SLS), and at <rs type="institution">RGBL (BESSYII)</rs> for a more comprehensive understanding of the TiZrHf-based system, with special attention to the two opposite roles of <rs type="person">Ti Nb</rs> and Ta (smaller elements), and <rs type="funder">Zr and Hf</rs> (larger elements) which tend to produce larger structural distortions in the unit cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>At LISA beamline we employed the wide energy range attainable by the monochromator (Si 311 crystals for better resolution). We measured in both total electron yield and fluorescence mode simultaneously, finally determining that self-absorption was negligible (from TEY). Higher quality data was obtained in fluorescence mode using the 13-channels available HP Ge energy-selective detector. A cryostat was also used and selected specimens were measured at 80 K as well (not shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
