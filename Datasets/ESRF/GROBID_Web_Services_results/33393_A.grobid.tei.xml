<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Grazing-incidence diffraction from polycrystalline multilayers</p><p>Experiment number: SI-1306 Beamline: ID01 Date of experiment: from: 10. 5. 2006 to: 16. 5. 2006 Date of report: 18. .8. 2006</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shifts:</head><p>Report:</p><p>X-ray diffraction from periodic polycrystalline multilayers in grazing-incidence geometry is a new method making possible to determine the parameters of polycrystalline layers and their changes across the multilayer stack <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The method uses the fact that the primary beam irradiating the sample under a small incidence angle reflects specularly at the multilayer interfaces and the interference of the transmitted beam with the reflected beams creates a standing wave, the period of which equals the multilayer period. The grains of the polycrystalline material in the multilayer are irradiated by this standing wave, so that the intensity of the wave diffracted from these grains is modulated by the standing-wave intensity distribution. Similarly, after diffraction from the grains, the wave is reflected and transmitted through the multilayer interfaces and another standing wave results. Changing the angle of incidence α i or the angle of exit α f of the measured x-ray beam, the measured diffracted intensity I h (α i , α f , 2Θ) exhibits sharp maxima or minima corresponding to multilayer satellite maxima in the reflectivity curve R(α i ). Here we have denoted 2Θ the scattering angle in the azimu-thal direction (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The position of the antinodes of a standing wave created by the interference of the beams transmitted and reflected from a periodic multilayer depends on the incidence angle and it can be sensitively shifted by changing α i . Therefore, the shape of the diffraction curve I h (α i , α f , 2Θ=const) depends sensitively on the position of the diffracting layer in the multilayer period; a diffraction maximum is observed, if the diffracting layer lies in an antinode of the standing wave.</p><p>Preliminary measurements using a laboratory set-up [1] demonstrated the feasibility of the concept and the beamtime SI1306 was devoted to thorough tests of the method. We have measured a series of 4 Ni/C multilayers deposited by magnetron rf sputtering on glass substrates. The period D = T Ni + T C = 20 nm of the multilayer was the same in all samples, the ratio T Ni /D changed from ¼ (sample H1) to 4 (sample H4) . The measurements were carried out using two energies -8.2 keV and 8.33 keV, the latter is close to the NiK absorption edge. For given incidence angle α i we measured the intensity distribution I h (α i = const, α f , 2Θ) using a linear detector perpendicular to the sample surface and changing the azimuthal scattering angle 2Θ. Figure 2 shows the reflectivity curve of sample H1, and in Fig 3. we present the 2Θ scan of the same sample measured for α i = 1 deg. The peaks in the curve were identified to highly textured pure Ni and nearly not textured Ni 3 C phases. In Fig. 4 we have plotted, an example of the measured intensity map in the angular (α f ,2Θ) space for α i = 0.45 deg; this value corresponds to the intensity minimum between two satellite maxima at the reflectivity curve. The map represents a part of the Debye-Scherer ring; the sharp modulation along the α f axis is clearly visible. From the comparison of the measured curves with numerical simulations it will be possible to determine exactly the position of the NiC layers in the multilayer and to study the interdiffusion process in detail. This will be the subject of further investigations.</p><p>[1] P. F. Fewster, N. L. Andrew, V. Holy, and K. <ref type="bibr">Barmak, Phys. Rev. B 72, 174105 (2005)</ref>. Fig 4.

The curves differ especially close to the standing-wave modulation at α f = 0.5 deg; the difference can be ascribed to the fact that the Ni and NiC layers have differfent positions in the period of the Ni/C multilayer. The NiC layers occur at the Ni-C interfaces due to an interdiffusion and subsequent chemical reaction.From the comparison of the measured curves with numerical simulations it will be possible to determine exactly the position of the NiC layers in the multilayer and to study the interdiffusion process in detail. This will be the subject of further investigations.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,314.48,339.44,229.68,180.96" type="bitmap" /></figure>
