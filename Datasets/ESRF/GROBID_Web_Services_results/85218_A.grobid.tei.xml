<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Electron-phonon coupling in superconducting CaC 6 studied at the Ca L-edge with RIXS </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to study multi-phonon scattering at the Ca L-edge in CaC 6 , which superconducts below 11.5 K. Ca-derived states at the Fermi surface are known to couple to high-energy (~90 meV) C-derived phonons, and recently RIXS has been shown to be sensitive to electron-phonon coupling.</p><p>The beamline and spectrometer gave an overall energy resolution of about 25 meV at the Ca L-edge using an exit slit opening of 40 µm. This resolution should be more than sufficient to see the phonons of interest (~90 meV): in principle a resolution of around 50 meV would also work. In order to try to enhance the incident flux at the expense of the energy resolution, we tried to open the exit slit from 40 µm to 60 µm. Unexpectedly this caused a two peak structure in the energy resolution function, so we remained at 40 µm.</p><p>We looked at 3 different CaC 6 samples over the 2 days of beamtime. The 1 st and 3 rd samples were made from the same starting graphite material, a natural flake graphite originating from Madagascar, which typically contains 1 or 2 different crystallites, misoriented from each other within the graphite plane (in-plane). The 2 nd sample was made from HOPG (highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite), which is completely disordered in-plane.</p><p>The XAS (measured using total electron yield) from the 1 st and 3 rd CaC 6 samples both initially gave two broad peak features at the Ca L 3 and L 2 edges, as shown in the black line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. We attempted to measure XAS via fluoresence using the CCD detector mounted on the sample vessel, but we saw no signal. We found that in all samples the XAS degraded significantly in time, and that the beam also caused the sample to degrade. We inferred that degradation was occuring due to the appearance of additional pre-peak structures on the primary 2 peaks (see the green line on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). These pre-edge features are typically observed in insulating Ca-containing compounds, including in CaO. All XAS measured on the 2 nd sample (made from HOPG) contained these 2 pre-peaks, suggesting that this sample had already been exposed to air or water. We hypothesise that the disordered nature of HOPG could easily lead to microscopic fissures in the crystal that could allow air to rapidly react with the sample during sample introduction into the load lock. Moreover, any existing weakness in the structure would then be a natural location for the cleave to occur.</p><p>The 1 st sample was cooled to approximately 30 K, but after 10 hours we found that from the XAS measurements most of the sample had dramatically degraded, apart from the part of the sample that had been illuminated. This behaviour is likely to be due to water condensing on the sample (as the cryostat is effectively acting as a cryopump). The illuminated part of the sample was protected due to beam heating. As a result all measurements on the 2 nd and 3 rd samples were performed at room temperature.</p><p>We observed a very broad inelastic feature in the Ca L-edge RIXS data measured on the 1 st and 3 rd CaC 6 samples, but this feature was not the same in those two cases (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). At the present time we cannot explain why these two datasets are not consistent with one another. Both were measured at approximately the same position in reciprocal space, and we have no reason to doubt the quality of either CaC 6 sample. Both of the datasets shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> were measured for between 4 and 5 hours.</p><p>We measured on the 3 rd sample for approximately 36 hours. During that time we were constantly monitoring the XAS signal from the sample, and we were always able to find a part of the sample that gave a 'good' XAS spectrum (two broad peaks with minimal pre-peak structure: see the black line on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). However in the last 12 hours of beamtime we observed no inelastic signal on this 3 rd sample. The XAS measurements are primarily sensitive to the surface of the sample, so it is difficult to understand how the surface could stay the same while the 'bulk' that we are sensitive in the RIXS process could degrade. One explanation could be that one of the byproducts of the CaC 6 sample degradation is metallic (e.g. calcium metal), and so observing metallic XAS is not necessarily a good measure of the sample quality. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any published data on elemental Ca at the Ca L-edge to help us understand this behaviour further.</p><p>On the basis of this preliminary study, we request another 6 shifts of beamtime to assess the feasibility of this experiment further. In preparation for these 6 shifts we will prepare a new batch of CaC 6 samples from single-crystal graphite samples that will be prealigned with a lab x-ray source prior to our arrival at the ESRF. This would enable us to straightforwardly monitor the (00L) Bragg peaks from the CaC 6 samples to monitor the quality of the samples over time independently of the XAS measurements.</p><p>We also request that the beamline performs the following two tasks prior to these 6 shifts of beamtime:</p><p>1. A full bake-out of the sample chamber to reduce the amount of water in the vacuum space. This should radically increase the effective lifetime of the sample in the sample chamber. It would be interesting to explore whether the cryostat could be used as a cryopump while ensuring the sample is thermally isolated but still electrically connected to the sample mount (e.g. by mounting the sample on a plate of manganin). This would also reduce the amount of water adsorption onto the sample surface.</p><p>2. More x-ray commissioning at the Ca L-edge to understand better the origin of the two peak structure in the energy resolution function when increasing the size of the exit slit. The observed RIXS signal is very weak, so any increase in photon flux on the sample would be very helpful of course.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr Andrew Walters* (Diamond Light Source) Mr Mohammed K.
