<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Purpose:</p><p>In this work we wanted to study a new nanocomposite gel, composed of the polymer poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) with embedded laponite-clay nanoplatelets acting as cross links. In addition we also introduced magnetite nanoparticles into the system. The gels can be stretched to a high degree, by mechanical force, resulting in alignment of polymer chains. The 10 nm big magnetite particles are superparamagnetic and will align into chains and columns in magnetic fields, altering the mechanical properties of the gels.These two alignment procedures were expected to be highly recognizable in the scattering patterns. In this project we investigate the possibility of obtaining permanently aligned clay-and magnetite nanoparticles when the gels finish polymerizing, and in this experiment we wanted in addition to look at the evolution of polymer chains during polymerization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>We studied different PNIPA-Laponite gels with changing contents of magnetite particles and varying magnetic fields, both in-situ and ex-situ. The reaction solutions were filled into 2 mm capillaries shortly after the initiator had been added to start the polymerization reactions. The capillaries were mounted in either a custom made holder between two permanent magnets with the magnetic field perpendicular to the beam direction, or in a sample holder capable of holding several capillaries at once.</p><p>During the in-situ data collection on NC-gels without magnetite particles, there was no change in the curve shape with time, only a decrease in scattering intensity. During long exposure times the beam heated up the samples, and some of the water was expelled from the gel itself. When water was later reabsorbed the intensity was recovered. The preservation of the curve shape with time indicate that there are no inhomogeneities appearing in the material during polymerization. Therefore, the cross-linking with laponite platelets is likely to be homogeneous throughout the samples, which is an important result.</p><p>Anisotropic scattering patterns (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) were recorded for the NC-gels with embedded magnetite particles (FNC-gels) when they were situated in magnetic fields. The anisotropy was maintained in the samples after they were removed from the magnetic field, as we hoped for. Cake integration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the magnetic field, revealed structural changes at length scales bigger than 30 nm which corresponds well to chains consisting of 10 nm magnetite particles.</p><p>A detailed analysis of these data is in progress.  0,1 1 1 10 100 0,1 1 0,1 1 c) b) Intensity (arb. units) q (nm -1 ) a) 0T perp a) 0T par a) q (nm -1 ) b) 1T perp b) 1T par q (nm -1 ) c) 1T + 0T perp c) 1T + 0T par Magnetic field direction FNC-gel polymerized in magnetic field a) b) c)</p></div>
