<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>CrCl3 is an antiferromagnetic layered material whose single layer unit is intrinsically ferromagnetic with inplane aligned magnetic moment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It represents a typical example of layer dependence in van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, almost all experimental proofs of single layer properties in CrCl3 come from exfoliated flakes, and only a very small amount of works describe few or single layer compounds prepared by epitaxial solid state methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Hereafter, we report the main results that we obtained from the preliminary characterizations of epitaxial ultra-thin films of CrCl3 grown on Au(111) substrate in our ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Growth methods:</head><p>We grew epitaxial CrCl3 by codeposition of Cr and Cl atoms on Au(111) single crystal substrate. Chromium is deposited from an e-beam evaporator source using highly pure (99.99%) Cr rods. Evaporation conditions have been found with the help of a quartz micro balance (QMB) mounted in situ in our UHV system and the effective deposited amount of Cr was calibrated by estimating the partial coverage in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STM) images. Chlorine is instead evaporated by applying resistive heat to a crucible containing anhydrous CrCl3 powder (99.99%). Halogens in fact cannot be supplied directly in UHV because the high vapor pressure of the pure elements is extremely polluting for a UHV chamber. Since halogen evaporation from metal halides is far preferable, we chose CrCl3 powder as Cl precursor, which avoid contaminations of the substrate with other metallic species different from chromium. The crucible can be filled under inert atmosphere inside a glove box, i.e. in N2 gas, in order to reduce the sample exposure to moisture. We found that Cl evaporation temperature in our evaporator is 500¬∞C. The deposition time was set in order to reach a total CrCl3 coverage lower than one monolayer and a stoichiometric ratio close to Cr:I=1:3. Substrate temperature varies between 180¬∞C and 210¬∞C. Hereafter we report the preliminary results gathered from CrCl3 growth attempts by two methods: 1) codeposition of Cr and Cl on Au(111) from the two different element sources described above and 2) by simple CrCl3 evaporation on the same substrate, without the use of Cr e-beam source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of a Cr chloride prepared by codeposition of Cr and Cl</head><p>We prepared a sample by codeposition of Cr and Cl on Au(111). The low energy electron diffraction (LEED) is characterized by an array of intense spots arranged in hexagonal symmetry (fig <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). At 59eV the Au substrate first-order reflections are expected in the positions marked by yellow circles. Overlayer spots (pink circles) are aligned along the substrate high symmetry directions and show a periodicity that is indicative of a 6x6 reconstruction (approximately 1.7nm large supercell). From Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) data we estimated that the deposited amount of chlorine is five times that of chromium, exceeding the 1:3 stoichiometric ratio expected in CrCl3. Owing to that, we expect that the excess chlorine might be adsorbed on the bare gold surface. The STM images (fig 1c-e) show instead a variety of structures lying on the surface: several tens of nanometer large triangular (T) islands exhibiting a moir√© pattern are surrounded by rectangular (R) stripes on top of which we do not notice any intensity modulation. Both the type of islands don't overcome the 2 »¶ apparent height. The same moir√© as on the T-islands is observed instead on the surface nearby, whereas the characteristic Au herringbone reconstruction has not been found anywhere, accordingly with LEED. The size of the moir√© superperiodicity is about 8.5 »¶, half of that estimated by LEED. These values do not correspond neither to the ùëù(‚àö3 √ó ‚àö3)ùëÖ30¬∞ reconstruction reported for 0.33ML Cl/Au(111) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> nor to CrCl3 lattice parameters found in literature, i.e. 5.9»¶ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measured at Cr edge (576eV) reveals a broad but structured profile, which hides multiplet features more consistent with hybridized rather than metallic chromium states (fig 2, left). However, X-ray circular magnetic dichroism (XMCD) signal is very weak or totally absent in some areas of the sample (fig 2, right), both when the beam is normal to the surface and when it is more grazing, and the sample does not seem to be ferromagnetic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simple CrCl3 evaporation on Au(111)</head><p>When we evaporate CrCl3 without depositing metallic Cr in parallel from the e-beam source, AES shows that both Cr and Cl are present on the gold substrate. We deduce that CrCl3 clusters reach and nucleate on the substrate. This observation is consistent with Ref <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In fact halogens atoms are expected to desorbs from the metal halides when they are annealed at few hundreds degrees temperature, whereas metal-chlorine sublimation might be favored at higher temperatures (however, our QMB does not detect evaporated species below 480¬∞C evaporation temperature, while AES measurements on Au(111) exclude traces of chlorine at 330¬∞C). The corresponding LEED pattern is shown in fig 1b. Two domains are identified, 30¬∞ rotated the one respect to the other, both having a periodicity 2.5 times larger than Au(111), i.e. 7.2»¶, namely one angstrom above typical CrCl3 lattice parameter. STM images in this case show irregular shape islands, 4-5√Ö high, without moir√© pattern, homogeneously distributed on the surface but with negligible overall coverage. Annealing at 400¬∞C restores a clean herringbone reconstructed Au surface. No XAS and XMCD measurements have been measured for this sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Experiments demonstrate the formation of extended ordered 2D structures on the Au(111) surface upon growth by codeposition of Cr and Cl. However, not all the results are converging at moment towards CrCl3 monolayer. More likely, our probes suggest the presence of multiple possible phases, that we may identify among CrCl3, CrCl2, pure Cr, adsorbed Cl, as we know from the literature. The STM moir√© features might be corresponding either to adsorbed Cl layer or to a full monolayer Cr chloride, on top of which other species have nucleated and grown, i.e. R and T islands. Overall, the sample does not show ferromagnetism. Next steps to follow in order to achieve a single CrCl3 phase must include: 1) low rate deposition to obtain sub monolayer coverages; 2) lower CrCl3 evaporation temperature (favouring Cl atoms sublimation without Cr) to get rid of a second Cr source; 3) new depositions of CrCl3 from CrCl3 source without the use of the Cr e-beam source, followed by XAS and XMCD investigations.
