<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The need for clean and abundant fuels will be one of the greatest challenges to mankind in the near future, as the peak oil discussion has settled, stating that the peak of oil production will be reached within the next 10-20 years. Fuel cells are one of the most promising alternatives, since their working principle is mostly understood and recent activities are focused on increasing their efficiency. However, the production of "fuels" for fuel cells, i.e. hydrogen H 2 and oxygen O 2 in the simplest case, remains one bottleneck that prevents fuel cells to be already considered a serious alternative to fossil fuels. Water splitting reactions are a very promising approach to overcome this limitation, since "The ultimate solution to satisfy the world's energy demand is the cleavage of water into its atomic building blocks, hydrogen and oxygen". <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Empiric studies identified molecular Ir(III) complexes (left in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>) in presence of cerium ammonium nitrate CAN as catalysts of high activity for water oxidation (i.e. O 2 production), as revealed by increasing numbers of high-impact publications. 2 However, the fate of these complexes in course of the reaction is unclear. We thus studied a set of molecular complexes under water oxidation conditions to gain a detailed insight into the formed species. These complexes were of complex nature based on oxazoline ligands, but also more simple complexes like iridium chloride and iridium acetylacetonate, in complarison to IrO 2 . These compounds were investigated by thorough XAS experiment, both the precatalysts and under water oxidation conditions. The XANES spectra were analyzed by LC-XANES fit in order to determine the oxidation state ratio of Ir(III)/Ir(IV), which is unequivocally formed under reaction conditions, but with unknown concentrations. The EXAFS data was then analyzed first also with respect to ths oxidation state ration in an indirect way by determination of the Ir-backscattering pair cahractersitic for the precursor. The reduction in the respective coordination number under water oxidation conditions can be correlated with a decrease in the precursor oxidation state +III, which fits to the results determined by LC-XANES fit. Since the iridium in the state +IV could be proved to be of some IrO 2 character by other methods, in a second step of the EXAFS analysis a relative size determination of the IrO 2 species was performed. The results were difficult to interpret, since no clear trend between oxidation state ratio and IrO 2 size was obvious. The spectra and obtained results are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>, the final interpretation achieved by help of other methods in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Although furthe rstudies need to follow, the current interpretation is that depending on the point of the reaction, both Ir(III) and Ir(IV) are catalytically active. At the beginngin of the reaction, molecular Ir(III) makes the reaction, while towards the end, Ir-oxo species do. [1] M. Beller, ChemSusChem 2008, 1, 463. [2] M.
