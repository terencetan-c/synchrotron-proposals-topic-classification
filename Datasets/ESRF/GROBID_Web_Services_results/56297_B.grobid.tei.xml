<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>The study of N 2 -rare gas systems is demonstrating a rich auto-organization of molecular systems under pressure. The first van der Waals compound was observed in N 2 -He system, as (N 2 ) 11 He <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and its structure explained by the substitution of N 2 molecules by He atoms at specific sites of the ε-N 2 structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The first clathrate organized by the quadrupolar interaction has been recently discovered in the N 2 -Ne system, as (N 2 ) 6 (Ne) 7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Van der Waals compounds also exist in N 2 -Ar and N 2 -Xe systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The aim of this proposal was to determine their associated structures. Intriguing arrangements of N 2 molecules are certainly to be discovered by this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>April 22 th to April 24 th 2015</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>Three membrane diamond anvil cells were equipped with anvils of 150, 400 and 500 µm in culet size, respectively. All cells were loaded with a Xe-N 2 mixture, with xenon concentrations of 7 (2x) and 67 mol%. All samples were brought to the ESRF at pressures lower than 2.5 GPa. Ruby was used as a pressure gauge. Angular dispersive powder X-ray diffraction was performed with a monochromatic beam of energy E = 30 keV at the ID09 beamline. The X-ray diffraction images were collected with an on-line image plate detector (MARCCD). The beam was focussed down to ~ 25 µm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Samples with xenon concentrations of 67, 7 and 7 mol% were studied up to 6, 25 and 81 GPa, respectively. For all samples, two phases were observed below 5 GPa. One was found to be pure nitrogen while the other was attributed to a xenon-rich solid (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The xenon-rich solid has the structure of pure xenon (Fm3m) but a very slightly different volume. Since its cell volume is not largely above that of pure xenon, it was assumed that nitrogen atoms inserted themselves in the lattice by substituting xenon atoms.</p><p>Above 5 GPa, a new phase corresponding to a van der Waals compound was revealed (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>) and b)). Its Bravais lattice along with its space group and stoichioimetry were determined.  A phase transition occured in the van der Waals compound at ~ 10 GPa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>)). Again, the Bravais lattice was determined along with the space group. The stoichiometry of the compound persisted through the phase transition. From the Rietveld refinement shown at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the Wyckoff position of the xenon and nitrogen atoms in the high pressure phase was resolved. This phase was found stable up 81 GPa; the highest pressure reached.</p><p>July 5 th to July 7 th 2015</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>Three membrane diamond anvil cells were equipped with anvils of 100, 300 and 400 µm in culet size, respectively. All cells were loaded with a Xe-N 2 mixture, with xenon concentrations of 7 (2x) and 30 mol%. In order to validate the structural parameters previously determined, single crystals of the van der Waals compound low pressure phase were grown. Xe-N 2 , with 7 mol% of xenon, solidifies at 2.5 GPa whereas the van der Waals compound is stable only above 5 GPa. Therefore high temperatures acheived by resistive heating were necessary to have the solid Xe-N 2 compound in equilibrium with the liquid phase and grow a single crystal. Too high temperatures are required to similarly produce a single crystal of the van der Waals compound high pressure phase. Therefore, once the necessary single crystal diffraction images of the lowpressure phase were taken, pressure was increased above 10 GPa with the cells heated. The samples transitioned to the high-pressure phase while at high temperatures, with the hopes of minimizing crystal damage. Ruby and gold were used as pressure calibrants. Angular dispersive X-ray diffraction with a monochromatic beam of energy E = 30 keV was performed at the ID09 beamline. The X-ray diffraction images were collected with an on-line image plate detector (MARCCD). The beam was focussed down to ~ 25 µm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The single crystal X-ray diffraction of the low pressure phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) allowed us to confirm the previously determined lattice and space group. The full structural resolution has not yet been completed at this stage of the analysis. Despite occuring at high temperatures, the phase transition from the low to the high pressure phase significantly damaged the crystal. Data quality is not sufficient for a complete structural resolution of the high pressure phase.</p><p>The cell equipped with anvils of 100 µm in culet size allowed to reach a pressure of 154 GPa. The high pressure phase of the van der Waals compound was still stable at that pressure. The structural studies of Xe/N 2 van der Waals compound was more demanding than expected and so no beamtime could be devoted to the structural studies of Ar/N 2 compounds. That will be performed by the application of a continuation proposal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Diffraction patterns, a) 4.8 GPa, only pure nitrogen and the xenon-rich solid can be seen. b) 5.5 GPa, numerous high-quality rings appear, belonging to the van der Waals compounds. c) 10.3 GPa, a phase transition occurs and is characterized by the new diffraction ring evidenced by the red arrow.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.10,197.87,228.20,323.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
