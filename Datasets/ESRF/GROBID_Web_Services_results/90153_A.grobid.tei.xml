<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With this experiment we wanted to investigate the solvation shells of organic solvents around palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) with an average diameter of 3 nm. The overall sizes of the solvation shells, the molecular configurations of the solvent molecules at the particle-solvent interface and structural changes that occur during a catalytic reaction should be correlated with the catalytic activity of the NPs in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of styrene to ethylbenzene.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proposed experiments were carried out using the 70 keV X-ray beam centered in the corner of the CdTe detector, the capillary holder provided by the beamline ID15-EH3 and an in-situ setup designed by our own. In preparation of the experiment Pd NPs stabilized by 1-hexanethiol and 1-dodecanethiol with a diameter of 3.0 ± 0.5 nm were successfully synthesized. They were proven to be long term stable in dispersion in different organic solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF), hexane, cyclohexane, toluene and chlorinated solvents like dichoromethane  For the experiment, the nanoparticles were first mixed with the organic solvent in a special gas tight Schlenk flask. Via connectors with valves, Swagelok fittings and perfluoralkoxy (PFA) hoses, the flask got connected to a 1.55 mm borosilictate capillary, which was mounted in a capillary holder and placed in the X-ray beam. The mixture was pumped through the circuit with a micro annular gear pump. Before purging the flask with 1 bar H2 and adding styrene to start the reaction, a background measurement was recorded. We performed different catalysis with Pd NPs with different capping agents. Each catalysis was measured for 2 h with a readout time of 8 s, and the data was binned afterwards to enhance statistics. Unfortunately and against the expectations, the shape, position and intensity of the first sharp diffraction peak was entirely unaffected by the occurring catalysis for all NP-solvent mixtures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). This indicates that i) there is in principle no significant solvent restructuring around the Pd NPs or ii) there is at least no impact of the Pd NPs onto the interfacial solvent structure in the range where our dispersions showed catalytic activity and were colloidally stable.</p><p>Besides the in-situ experiments, we performed ex-situ background measurments of the Pd NP powders, pure solvents and reactants. Additional, we brought oleic acid stabilized FexOy NP powders and dispersions in THF and cyclohexane to investigate the solvent restructuring at the NP-solvent inferface. By subtraction of the bulk solvent and the FexOy powder signal, the double-difference PDF (dd-PDF) is gained. It contains the information of the restructered solvent molecules around the NPs, which was present over ca. 20 Å in this case as a sinusoidal oszillation. For comparison of the restructured solvent molecules 6 nm and 9 nm sized NPs were measuerd in the different solvents. Further analysis hereof is still ongoing. We expect submission of the paper in the start of fall 2019. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: left: Experimental difference-PDF (d-PDF) of colloidal Pd NPs in THF (solvent contribution already subtracted, black) with contribution of Pd NPs (red) and in offset the dd-PDF of the restructured solvent molecules (green); right: Results of the catalytic lab studies, yield given for ethyl benzene (selectivity ≥ 99%); reaction conditions: 0.5 mmol styrene, rt, 1 bar H2, 5 mol% catalyst (2.7 mg Pd, 0.025 mmol, 4 mg Pd NPs), 3 mL solvent, 2h.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,213.25,548.70,356.75,145.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
