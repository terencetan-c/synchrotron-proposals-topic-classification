<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The idea was to test first a thick (ï‚»100 nm) film, then move to thinner Fe films and then to nano clusters, always embedded in either amorphous silica or in gold. The two substrates are expected to influence the phase transition.</p><p>The furnace available at the beamline worked at a maximum temperature of about 900C-950C on the heating filament, but the temperature achieved on the sample was always well below 900 C (likely around 800C). For this reason, the experiment failed for the most part.</p><p>The problems we had to face with the furnace were:</p><p>-The maximum temperature was too low for our purposes (about 100C lower than requested in the proposal) -At the maximum heating condition, the furnace walls were too hot, causing the explosion of the kapton windows.</p><p>-The heating filament broke twice. So, we spent most part of the time trying to fabricate a suitable metallic shield to limit as most as possible the loss of heat by irradiation. Different kind of combinations [shield]/[sample holder]/[chamber cooling system] were tested, but we only could arrange some temporary solution during the last night, when we could finally measure the phase transition on two films (100 nm thick), one embedded in silica and the other one in gold. The fcc and bcc crystalline phases have different Fe K-edge features (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We consider as a preliminary order parameter the value of (a+c)/2-b, where a,b,c are the values of the x-ray absorption coefficient located as in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In this way the fcc (bcc) phase has a positive (negative) value of the order parameter. The variation of this parameter as a function of the temperature measured close to the sample is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> for the case of a 100 nm thick Fe films embedded in silica.</p><p>In this sample, the transition is expected to mimic the bulk one, as it actually occurs. This should have been our starting point for the experiment, while it could unfortunately be our last measurement.</p><p>For a future experiment, the furnace should be first tested in real conditions, i.e., testing the temperature of the sample and not (only) of the heating filament. From our side, we are in contact with the beamline staff and we sent some suitable samples for a test. We are willing to perform again the experiment in case a full study is preliminary carried out by ESRF staff to provide a furnace within the specifications required.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,56.70,70.85,278.90,226.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
