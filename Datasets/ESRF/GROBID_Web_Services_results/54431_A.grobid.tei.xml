<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Natural colloids formed by weathering of mine-contaminated soils may transport hazardous elements such as As in surface waters reaching areas situated at long distances from the contaminant source. The important role of inorganic colloids as metal(oid)s carriers in natural systems has already been documented. Colloids may behave as nanovectors of toxic elements between environmental compartments of the soil-water system in contaminated sites. The nature of the colloid-arsenic interactions determines metal mobility and bioavailability and thus need to be characterized to prevent and evaluate the pollution process. However, the colloid stability and the nature of the chemical bonding of As in colloidal nanovectors depends on the inorganic or organic nature of the nanoparticle and the geochemical conditions which may be highly variable within the natural travel path potentially covered. It is necessary to know the occurrence of mobile colloids in natural systems, their organic or inorganic nature and the physical and chemical conditions that induce their release to the soil solution as well as the nature of the interaction contaminant-colloids in soils. In addition, it is also important to compare these colloids with the As-bearing phases which cause the As spread in mine-impacted soil. Our project has a two-fold objective:</p><p>(1) to study the role of soil natural colloids as nanovectors of toxic elements in the contamination process of the soil-water system and (2) to evaluate possible changes in the As speciation between leaching dispersible colloids and bulk soil samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental methods</head><p>In the Mónica mine, nearby Bustarviejo (NW Madrid, Spain), silver was extracted since the XV century until it was close in 1980. Pyritic dumps remain close to Bustarviejo village along the La Mina stream gorge. Large amounts of metal(oid)s are released to the media but there is just a few studies on metal(oid) spreading from this area and no spectroscopic information is available to the best of our knowledge. Further research is thus needed to reveal whether stable metal-colloid particles may effectively control metal distribution and retention mechanisms in the soil and to elucidate the mechanisms behind the transport of metals through the soil especially in locations like this, affected by large amount of metals released due to the acid mine drainage and close to urban areas. Undisturbed soil cores (0-15 cm depth) were collected along the natural stream from the pyritic waste pile (source point of As pollution) until approximately one kilometer far away. Samples were immediately frozen after collect them, and later vacuum-dried, sieved (2-nm mesh) and homogenized in a glove box. Leaching batch experiments were performed at solid/solution ratio equal to 1:10 under anoxic conditions and the dispersible colloidal fraction ≤ 1000 nm was isolated by centrifugation (ω=800 rpm, 10 min). Subsequently, solid colloids with sizes ranging 1000-10 nm were deposited on ultrafiltration membranes (10 nm membrane pore size). These membranes were placed on peek holders and sealed with Kapton tape for XAS analyses. Additionally, bulk samples were powdered, diluted 9:10 with cellulose and pressed into 13-mm pellets inside the glove box, and subsequently measured by XAS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples and spectra collected</head><p>During our experiment, one soil core collected from the processing waste-pile (WP) and three soil core samples collected along the stream (A-B-C) together with their corresponding dispersible colloids (1000-10 nm) were measured under anoxic conditions (using a vacuum reactor) in order to evaluate both the As and Fe speciation by K-edge EXAFS analysis. A total of 96 EXAFS (7 As-spectra + 5 Fe-spectra per sample) were collected in fluorescence mode on bending-magnet BM25A beamline (SpLine) using a 13-element Si(Li) solid state detector, at room temperature. In addition, thallium pure compounds (TlNO 3 , TlS, TlAc, Tl 2 O 3 ) and thallium absorbed to synthetic standards (smectite, illite and Na-birnessite) as well as lorendite (thallium arsenic sulfosalt) were measured by Tl L3-edge EXAFS analysis in order to get a library reference spectrum for later studies involving thallium. A total of 23 EXAFS were collected in transmission mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Preliminary As and Fe XANES analysis of both the colloidal fraction and the bulk samples indicated only the presence of As(V) and Fe(III) along the stream. The As and Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra of the point-source of As (WP) and the furthest experimental location (C) are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (As) and Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (Fe), for both the colloidal and bulk samples. Samples from WP clearly showed a different As and Fe speciation of samples collected in C zone, and interestingly, the K-edge EXAFS spectra presented significant variations between bulk and colloidal samples, which should be properly analyzed by Linear combination fits (Athena) and by shell-by-shell fittings (Artemis). In addition, thallium reference spectra collected during this beamtime are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. These reference EXAFS data are expected to be extremely useful in our future Tl speciation studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The EXAFS analyses confirmed the expected differences on As and Fe speciation between the point-source of As contamination (WP) and the other samples collected along the stream reaching up to 1 km of distance (A-B-C). The comparison between bulk and colloidal samples also established significant unexpected variations, which should be carefully analyzed. We expect that the processing of the data collected during this beamtime could provide evidence that colloids are effectively acting as contaminant carriers and represented a rapid transport pathway for element pollutants such as has been previously found by our research group in other polluted areas [1]. This work has been performed within the project CGL2010-17434 supported by the Spanish National Research Plan.</p><p>Those results are in preparation as: M.A. Gómez-González, J. García-Guinea, J.F.
