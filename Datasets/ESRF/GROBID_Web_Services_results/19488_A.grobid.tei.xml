<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5HSRUW</head><p>We have succeeded in recording X-ray topographs and rocking curves of a single copper mosaic crystal at the photon energies of 96 and 136 keV. From these experimental results some conclusion can be drawn:</p><p>1. The rocking curves present a much lower reflectivity than that predicted by theoretical models using the Darwin equations [1], [2] (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This result is consistent with neutron measurements performed at ILL <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Moreover, in some cases the measured peak reflectivity at 136 keV is higher than at 96 keV, contrary to the theoretical calculations. 2. Rocking curves registered using a small beam (0.025mm x 4mm) impinging on the crystal surface at different positions are similar, thus showing a relative good DYHUDJHG uniformity in terms of mosaicity across the crystal. 3. Some X-ray topographs clearly show that different crystal regions diffract in very different ways. This is probably due to the fact that the crystal consists of different blocks sligtly misaligned one respect to others (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We have to thank the ID15 staff for their effort to make this experiment successful. However, some technical problems and an underestimation of the number of requested shifts made it impossible to obtain concluding quantitative results that could lead into a publication. We are submitting a new proposal for the continuation of this project. We will measure other copper crystals samples and also mosaic germanium, as well as Ge crystals with graded d-spacing.</p></div>
