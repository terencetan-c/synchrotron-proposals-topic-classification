<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ternary compound SmMn 2 Ge 2 is the most unusual member of the RT 2 X 2 family. It displays three different magnetic phase transitions below 350 K, including the presence of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in an antiferromagnetic phase (AFM). In this AFM phase between 100~K and 150~K there are moments from both the Sm and Mn ions. This complicates the magnetic picture, and so far only non-element sensitive techniques have been used to study the system. Bulk magnetisation measurements have been undertaken showing such behaviour. Although many transport measurements have been made on this material, neutron experiments have been rare due to the high absorption of 149 Sm, making the experiments very difficult.</p><p>During March 2004 a sucsessful experiment was conducted on SmMn 2 Ge 2 on ID20. The sample was mounted within a closed cycle refrigerator (He) on the "Super-phi" axis of the 4circle diffractometer. After initial crystalographic allignment, the sample was cooled to a temperature of 130 K to coincide with the AFM region as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Satellite peaks were located surrounding principal Bragg reflections and off-resonant magnetic scattering was observed. The integrated intensity as a function of energy was measured for this reflection yielding a surprising result. Upon tuning to the Mn K-edge no change in the integrated intensity was found. However, upon tuning to the Sm L 2 -edge a strong resonant enhancement was observed with a weaker enhancement at the L 3 -edge (The L 2 -resonance is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This is consistent with the antiferromagnetic component residing on the Sm sites, contrary to the model of Tomka <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In addition, upon further cooling of the sample below the re-entrant region to a base temperature of 10 K the anti-ferromagnetic component was found to persist but display a large incommensurability.</p><p>Due to the very weak (&lt; 50 cps) of the antiferromagnetic reflection coupled with the need to integrate the reflection as a function of energy to obtain the resonances due to the high background from Mn fluorescence we were not able to finish this study. In order to prepare this for publication a further 18 shifts of beamtime will be required.</p><p>[1] G.
