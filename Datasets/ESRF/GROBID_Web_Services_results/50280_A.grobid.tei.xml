<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>High temperature aqueous fluids and magmatic vapors play a critical role in the formation of ore deposits in volcanic arcs <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Field observations and experimental studies indeed provide strong evidences that the formation of porphyry ore deposits (Cu, Au, Mo) results from the exsolution of a Cl and/or S-rich volatile phase from crystallizing magmatic intrusions at T &lt; 1000 <ref type="bibr">°C and P &lt; 200 MPa [1]</ref>. Depending on P-T conditions, two different volatile-rich phase are expected to contribute to the mobilization of Cu, Au and Mo in magmatic-hydrothermal environments: a lowdensity vapor phase (typical density 0.3-0.4 g.cm -3 ) and a denser hypersaline aqueous phase (brine) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Knowledge of the speciation, solubility and partition of metals <ref type="bibr">(Cu, Au, Mo)</ref>, but also of other elements constituting ore minerals (Fe, As, S), in these volatile-rich phases is fundamental to improve the modeling of porphyry ore deposits formation. The speciation of As and Cu in both low and high-density Cl and S-bearing phases at basic to acidic conditions, as well as their vapor/brine partitioning behavior is over-all well-characterized <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. However, most studies concentrated on relatively simple systems, i.e., not taking into account the interaction between volatile-rich phases and arc magmas and were conducted at P &lt; 80 MPa that only model the late-stage evolution of the hydrothermal system. The few studies investigating Cu partitioning between fluids and melts where either conducted at pressure where only a single phase fluid is present (P &gt; 1.5kbar) or analyzed the coexisting brine and vapor as a single fluid phase <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>.</p><p>During the allocated beamtime at BM-30B, we hence conducted experiments that aim to provide new constraints on the effect of pressure and temperature but also of fluid and melt composition on As and Cu behavior in magmatichydrothermal environments. Especially, we collected X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements up to 800 °C and 1500 bars to assess the speciation and fluid/melt or vapor/brine partition of these two elements. The first session conducted in April 2013 was dedicated to the investigation of Cu speciation and fluid/melt partition in systems involving H 2 O, NaCl and haplogranite melts. A second session was conducted in July 2013 to study the effect of Cl and S on As speciation in aqueous solutions and vapors up to 700 °C and 1500 bars.</p><p>All experiments were conducted in an autoclave <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> that was optimized to collect in situ XAS up to 950 °C and 1.5 kbar. For experiments dedicated to Cu behaviour in magmatic-hydrothermal systems, the hydrothermal cell was loaded with a 2m NaCl solution, a flake of native Cu and a piece of haplogranite glass. In order to constrain the effect of silicate melt on the speciation of Cu in the aqueous fluid, pure 2m NaCl solutions were also investigated. Additional experiments were also conducted with 1000 ppm Cu ±2m NaCl solutions to assess the effect of Cu saturation on Cu fluid/melt partition. Experiments investigating the effect of Cl and S on As behavior in high temperature aqueous fluids and vapors, were conducted using a 4000 ppm As -2m NaCl solution and native S. The X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were conducted around the Cu (8.7-9.9 keV range) and As K-edges (11.75-12.5 keV range) using an incident beam tuned by a Si(220) double crystal monochromator and focused down to ~ 150 x 300 (VxH) µm. XAS spectra were collected both in transmission and fluorescence mode using a Si diode and a Canberra 30 elements detector set at 90 ° from the incoming beam. After each heating step, the concentration of Cu or As in the different phases was monitored to ensure that chemical equilibrium was achieved before XAS measurements. Cu and As concentrations were then quantified to ±100 ppm from the absorption edge step of transmission spectra. In the first set of experiments, we encountered complications during the transition from single phase fluid to two-phase fluid (brine+vapor). Especially, distinction between low-density vapor, high density brine, silicate melt and the C pistons was difficult as both pistons were moving freely to accommodate the volume expansion induced by increasing temperature. In order to facilitate data collection during the second set of experiments, the design of the internal cell was adapted with a fixed upper piston that ensured that all analyses were conducted solely in the vapor phase, without contamination of the signal by brine or melt. The preliminary results are summarized below.</p><p>1) Cu speciation in hydrothermal fluids and haplogranite melts XANES spectra were collected in aqueous fluids and high temperature vapors up to 800 °C and 150 MPa. In agreement with our previous experiments (Report 30-02 1027), we find that XANES spectra collected in Cu-bearing 2m NaCl solution up to 600°C and 150 MPa display an intense pre-edge line around 8982.5 keV that was attributed to the formation of linear CuCl 2 -complexes [2] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1-B</ref>,<ref type="figure">C</ref>). However, there is a distinct change of speciation at 700 °C, i.e, after the separation of the fluid into a vapor and a brine phase, with a shift of the absorption edge of +0.5 eV and a broad flattening of the spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1-D</ref>). This spectrum strongly resembles those reported by [2] in low P-T highly saline solutions and suggests that Cu may be present as CuCl 3 2complex in high temperature vapors. The presence of haplogranite melt does not modify Cu speciation in single-phase fluid or high temperature vapor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1-E</ref>) The low solubility of Cu in the haplogranite melt (20-50 ppm as determined by LA-ICPMS) precluded the investigation of Cu speciation at high P-T.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Cu partitioning in vapor-brine-melt system</head><p>The expansion of the sample volume with increasing temperature removed the melt globule outside of the optical windows, hence precluding in situ detemination of Cu concentrations in the haplogranite melt. However, pieces of quench melt were recovered after experiments and analyzed by LA-ICMPS at the ETH Zurich. At quench conditions (825 °C and 150 MPa), the haplogranite melt contains up to 20-50 ppm of Cu, which closely matches the concentrations reported by <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> in similar systems at 800 °C and 100 MPa. These low concentrations confirm the strong partitioning of Cu towards the fluid phases (vapor+brine). In experiments conducted with 1000 ppm Cu -2m NaCl solutions, Cu concentrations up to 2000 ppm were observed in the vapor phase at 600 °C and 100 MPa. These high concentrations suggest that Cu may strongly partition into the vapor phase. However, further experiments should be conducted at similar conditions using fixed lower piston to assess Cu concentrations in the coexisting brine.</p><p>3) As speciation in high temperature aqueous fluids, vapors and sulfosalt melts XANES spectra were collected in 4000 ppm As -2m NaCl solutions up to 700 °C at 50, 100 and 150 MPa. At all investigated P-T conditions, the XANES spectra exhibit a characteristic shape attributed to the formation of As(OH) 3 complexes <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The transition from single-phase fluid to vapor phase do not modify As speciation. Similarly, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. shows that , in the presence of S, As remains as As(III) in the 2m NaCl aqueous fluid. At 400 °C and 100 MPa, we were also able to collect XAS spectra on a S melt globule equilibrated with the 2m NaCl solution. The edge position and the shape of the XANES spectra do not match those of As(III) but closely ressemble those of realgar (AsS) and orpiment (As 2 S 3 ) presented in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This suggest that As occurs as As(II) or As(III) sulfur complex in S melts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Phase transition and densities in the H 2 O-NaCl system</head><p>Following Beer-Lambert's law, the XAS data collected at the Cu and As K-edge also provide the opportunity to investigate the effect of temperature on the density of the analyzed fluids. In the investigated 2m NaCl solutions, the transition from a single phase fluid to a low density vapor phase that coexists with a denser hypersaline brine phase was monitored as a sudden decrease of the absorbption µ(E). For all loadings, the fluid density determined in the one phase domain closely match values predicted by [10] at 50, 100 and 150 MPa. However, the density data suggest that, with increasing pressure, the transition from the one phase to two-phase (vapor+brine) domain occurs at temperature significantly lower than expected from the Driesner and Heinrich's model (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). These observations have been further confirmed by visual observations conducted using sapphire internal cells at the Néel Institute. This deviation from Driesner and Heinrich's model probably arise from the different experimental techniques used. However, we note that while the model of <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> was based on a significant number of experimental data at P &lt; 50 MPa, this model only includes two datasets for extrapolation of fluid and vapor densities to 500 MPa. We hence plan to continue monitoring the density of NaCl solutions during our future measurements at the BM30-B beamline to ultimately built a new dataset on the effect of P-T-XNaCl on phase transition and brine and vapor densities in the H 2 O-NaCl system.</p><p>References: [1] Hedenquist, J.W., and Lowenstern, J.B., 1994.
