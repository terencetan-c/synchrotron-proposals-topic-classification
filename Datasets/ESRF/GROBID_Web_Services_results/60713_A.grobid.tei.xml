For example, Al(BH 4 ) 3 .6NH 3 releases more than 10 mass% of hydrogen below 140 C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> Here, a new aluminium based amidoborane, K[Al(NH 2 BH 3 ) 4 ], has been synthesized. It crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell with space group symmetry P-1 which is isostructural to the analogue Na[Al(NH 2 BH 3 ) 4 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> The crystal structure consists of [K(NH 2 BH 3 ) 6 ] 5-octahedra which facilitate the bridging between K + in 1D chains, while also bridging K + to Al 3+ to connect the 1D chains in a 3D network, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.

Efforts to synthesize NaGd(BH 4 ) 4 lead to an unstable, amorphous phase, which decomposes after one day at RT. All the new compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal system and the trend in their crystal structures are investigated. The bimetallic borohydrides with larger rare-earth cations (La, Ce, Pr) crystallize in space group Pbcn with both cations in the octahedral coordination (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Bimetallic borohydrides with smaller rare-earth cations (Y, Er, Yb) crystallize in space group Cmcm with Na in octahedral coordination and the rare-earth cation in tetrahedral coordination (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). The hydrogen storage properties of novel compounds were also studied by Sieverts' measurements. NaCe(BH 4 ) 4 and NaPr(BH 4 ) 4 show a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 1.65 and 1.04 wt% after four cycles of H 2 release/uptake, respectively, whereas that of NaEr(BH 4 ) 4 continuously decreases after each cycle. The reversibility is mainly assigned to the formation of rare-earth metal hydrides and possibly sodium borohydride. Furthermore, the dehydrogenated state contains rare-earth metal borides. A paper has been submitted based on these three compounds and is currently under review. </p></div>

		<title level="a" type="main">freezing out, adsorption and absorption. After concentrating, separation is achieved by classical methods such as gas chranatography (GC) or high pressure liquid chranatography (HPLC). Identification is based mainly on mass spectrometry, infra-red spectrometry and chrcmatographic data. 3. RESULTS The primary goal of these methods is to concentrate all volatile com­ pounds, mainly volatile organic compounds or VOCs, present. This mixture of VOCs, containing odorous ccmpcunds, next to a large majority of unodo-rous substance, then is analysed. This chemical analysis is based on the separation of these hundreds of compounds by gas chranatography, is hampe­ red by large amounts of water, which is always present in air, and which is also freezed out or adsorbed. The only way to escape more or less this difficulty is to use a rather apolar adsorbant, in casu Tenax GC or similar materials (e.g. Chranosorb 102) (5). A second limitation is the fact that no material will ever be capable of adsorbing all odorous com­ pounds completely, and permit to desorb then afterwards completely. For compounds with very low boiling point, e.g. hydrogen sulphide, strong ad-sorbants are necessary, while for odorants with high boiling point, e.g. skatol or the sesquiterpenes, thermal desorption is difficult with strong adsorbant s. So a compromise has to be accepted, or several complementa­ ry adsorbants have to be used. At this moment this compromise for concen­ trating all odorous substances is found in the adsorbant mentioned, kno­ wing that the most volatile compounds might escape partly. Many systems have been described and even carenercialised, but we use a home-built sy­ stem, which is schematically represented in figure 1 (6). On an outer side wall of the gas chromatograph (GC) an oven in which the Tenax-adsorp-tion-sampling tubes fit is constructed. Connections with pressurized he­ lium (transfer gas) is provided and their is a connection with a high tem­ perature resistant sixway valve, which replaces the normal GC-injector. During thermal desorption (position 1 in figure 1) the transfer gas, car­ rying desorbed volatiles, passes the sixway valve, a cold trap (stainless steel loop cold with liquid air) and enters the ambient air. The helium carrier gas is connected to the GC-column via the sixway valve. After the desorption stage which usually takes about 45 minutes, with a desorption oven temperature of 220°C for 30 minutes at least, the sixway valve is switched (position 2 in figure 1). At that moment transfer gas flows through the sixway valve directly into the ambient whereas the carrier gas passes the cold trap before entering the GC-column. The liquid air is removed from the cold trap and the latter is quickly heated by a high in­ tensity fload light. In this way condensed compounds are flash-evaporated and injected into the GC-system. Concentrating odorants by adsorption-desorption techniques produces a terribly complex mixture of VOCs, which is separated by gas chranato­ graphy. Fortunately this technique allows formidable separation power, but still then the result is not always sufficient far a clear-cut odour analysis. In figure 2 the GC-analysis is shown of an air sample in the neighbourhood of a rendering plant, showing a great number of VOCs; however almost all of them are hydrocarbons produced by cars and heating systems and sane other products, which do not contribute to the odour. Very small peaks of odorants are detected, which shows the difficult task of odour ana­ lysis with a general concentrating technique. Of course this analysis is far more relevant if emission gases are examined as is demonstrated in fi­ gure 3 (7). Part of these difficulties can be overcane if the odorants can</title>

	<note type="raw_reference">Novel ammine metal borohydrides Ammine metal borohydrides, M(BH 4 ) m •nNH 3 have attracted much attention due to the dihydrogen interaction between hydrogen bonded to N (H δ+ ) and hydrogen, bonded to B (H δ-), which may lower the hydrogen release temperature through combination of H δ+ and H δ-. 5 In this study, novel ammine metal borohydrides, M(BH 4 ) 3 -xNH 3 (M = Nd, Ho, Tb, Yb) were investigated by in-situ XRPD at SNBL, ESRF. From the high quality XRPD pattern it was possible to solve the crystal structures of 14 new ammine metal borohydrides. This was achieved by combining in-situ XRPD data with thermal analysis (TGA-DSC-MS). The results are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. A discrepancy in the temperature range of the different events are observed, e.g. Nd(BH 4 ) 3 -7NH 3 is observed to decompose at T ~ 76 °C by in-situ XRPD, however from TGA-DSC-MS it decomposes below 50 °C. This is probably caused by the argon flow (40 mL/min) used for the TGA-DSC- MS, while the back pressure of NH 3 might stabilize the compounds during the in-situ XRPD measurement. However, the events in TGA-DSC-MS are still clearly distinguished, and were used in order to obtain the right composition of the new compounds. The trend is almost similar for M = Ho, Tb, Yb, however, in these cases the M(BH 4 ) 3 -6NH 3 is not observed, while only one polymorph of M(BH 4 ) 3 -4NH 3 are observed. The M(BH 4 ) 3 -xNH 3 with x &gt; 4 releases pure ammonia, while pure hydrogen is released at x &lt; 4. A mixture of hydrogen and ammonia is observed for M(BH 4 ) 3 -4NH 3 . References:</note>
