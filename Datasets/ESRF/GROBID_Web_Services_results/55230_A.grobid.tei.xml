<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>DyTe 3 orders into two successive, orthogonal and incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) states in the Te-Te planes upon cooling the samples at ambient pressure. Electrical resistivity measurements [1]  revealed that pressure reduces the upper CDW transition temperature T CDW,1 while enhances the lower T CDW,2 , suggesting that the two CDWs might merge above 1 GPa, and possibly compete with the pressure-induced superconductivity found at lower temperatures. The objective of this experiments was to determine the temperaturepressure (T-P) phase diagram of single crystals of DyTe 3 via high-resolution XRD experiments under pressure and low temperatures. Special interest was concentrated in following the evolution in the T-P phase diagram of the order parameters and of the latticedistortion characteristic wavevectors q 1 and q 2 associated to the two CDWs.</p><p>Single crystals grown at Stanford University were laser-cut at ESRF. DyTe 3 is very malleable, and special care had to be taken to not strain the crystals, which turned out to be a difficult a decisive task. The samples were then loaded in three diamond-anvil cells (DACs) using He as pressure medium. We were able to control the temperature from 300 K to 25 K using a closed-cycle cryostat. We utilized a focused x-ray beam of &lt; 10 μm and a 2D plate detector. Samples were aligned with the out-of-plane b axis parallel to the incident beam. Scans consisted in rotations of the DAC-cryostat setup around the vertical axis from -30° to 30° in 0.5° steps, 1-3 second exposures. This resulted in 120 images per (P,T) point.</p><p>We performed three T-P runs, one with each DAC. These runs are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (left). In Run #1 the sample was cooled down at constant pressure of 0.5 GPa down to 25 K (points 1 to 7) then pressure was increased at constant T = 25 K to 3.5 GPa (points 7 to 17), and finally warmed up at constant P = 2.7 GPa to 125 K (points 18 to 21). In Run #2, the second DAC cooled down and pressurized in the stair-like case shown by points 22 to 40, also down to 25 K and to a maximum pressure of 3.5 GPa. In the final Run #3, a pressurization scan at 300 K was performed (points 41 to 51) to search for possible structural phase transitions in the whole pressure range of the two CDW states.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Data was analyzed using CrysAlisPro. Lattice refinement resulted In large errors arising probably from multiple rotated crystal phases, and in the best case, 20% of the found peaks were indexed. The percentage of indexed points decreased below 15% at low temperatures and even lower at higher pressures, probably due to degradation of the samples. From Run #3, lattice parameters and unit cell volume decreased linearly as expected, and no indications of structural phase transition were observed up to ~ 4.5 GPa.</p><p>We were able, to some extent, to follow the CDWs' superlattice peaks in the P-T phase diagram. Single pairs of satellite peaks corresponding to CDW1 appeared upon cooling in Run #1 and #2 (points 1-3 and 23-25), and at lower temperatures and higher pressures, two orthogonal pairs of satellite peaks appeared around certain undistorted lattice positions, shown in the right panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> with the corresponding q-vectors q 1 and q 2 . The phase diagram obtained herein is consistent with the previous results from electrical resistivity, and confirms that the lower T CDW,2 (P) line increases with pressure until it merges with the T CDW,1 (P) line. This suggests that a "double" CDW state seems to be achievable upon crossing a single transition line at high pressures, corroborated with the scans from points 18 to 21 and from 52 to 57.</p><p>Sample quality not enough to resolve the difference between q1 and q2, or to follow a satellite peak throughout the whole phase diagram for the determination of the pressure and temperature dependence of the order parameters.</p><p>[1] D. <ref type="bibr">A.
