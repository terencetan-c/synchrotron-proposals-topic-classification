				<title level="a" type="main">February 20 and 21, 2011 = 0.977 Å Multi-bunch mode Local contact: Mickael Cherrer We are on one hand, in collaboration with Beatrice Vallone (Roma, Italia), studying oxygen and CO binding to neuroglobin and myoglobin, and on the other hand studying oxygen binding to urate oxidase. Data collections are done at room temperature, with the crystal of protein inserted in a quartz capillary mounted on our specially designed pressurization cell. During this run, we have collected 29 full data collection at room temperature, under gas pressure, using our own pressurization cell. Neuroglobin: 16 full data collection, native, under oxygen pressure, under carbon monoxide pressure, and under xenon pressure, best resolution 1.70 Å Neuroglobin mutant V140W: 4 full data collection, native and under xenon pressure, best resolution 2 Å Myoglobin: 7 full data collection, native, under oxygen pressure and under carbon monoxide pressure, best resolution 1.5 Å Urate oxidase: 2 full data collection, native, best resolution 1.70Å</title>
