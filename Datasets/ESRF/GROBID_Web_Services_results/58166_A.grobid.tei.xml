<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim for this project was to examine the chemical and structural changes occurring in Ni/SiO2 (Ni) and Al2O3-coated Ni/SiO2 (Al-Ni) catalysts, during the dry reforming of methane (DRM). DRM is a promising process to convert two greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2) into a synthesis gas (H2/CO) that is a key feedstock for liquid fuels produced via Fischer-Tropsch or methanol synthesis. Ni-based catalysts exhibit a high activity, comparable to noble metals, but are prone to carbon deposition and sintering. In preliminary tests, we have observed an improvement in sintering and coke resistance of Ni catalysts when coated with a thin layer of Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition (ALD).</p><p>In order to elucidate the role of the Al2O3 overcoat in catalyst performance, we have carried out combined Ni K-edges XAS and XRD measurements of coated and uncoated Ni catalysts during reduction and under DRM conditions. The data were acquired under the following conditions:</p></div>

We could not observe any significant difference to Ni foil for both the reduced and reacted catalysts independent whether they were coated or not. This indicates that the deactivation of the uncoated catalyst is not due to changes in the oxidation state of the active site Ni. Turning to XRD measurement under DRM conditions, we observed Bragg reflections of graphite in the uncoated catalyst, whereas such reflections were not observed for the coated catalyst. These findings indicate that the formation of coke is the main deactivation mechanism for the uncoated catalysts. (a) XANES of the reduced and reacted catalysts under DRM conditions, and diffractograms (λ=0.506 Å) of (a) the uncoated and (b) coated catalyst during DRM. The XANES of Ni foil was included for reference. The following compounds were identified: (▲) Al2O3, (◆) Ni and (▼)graphite. In summary, operando XAS and XRD measurement allowed us to draw the following conclusions: i) Strong Ni-Al2O3 interaction due to the formation of NiAl2O4, ii) deactivation of uncoated Ni due to the formation of graphitic carbon. Combining our operando XAS/XRD results with ex-situ characterizations performed in our lab, we observe that the strong interaction between Ni and Al2O3 improves the sintering resistance of Ni, with smaller Ni particles, leading to a lower degree of coke deposition. A more detailed analysis of the data acquired is still under progress and a manuscript for publication is in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>mass spectroscopy. XANES and XRD data collected during calcination and reduction are shown in Fig. 1. Bragg reflections from NiO were only observed in the calcined catalysts, whereas also NiAl2O4 was observed in the ALD coated catalyst. The formation of NiAl2O4 indicates a strong interaction between Ni and the Al2O3 layer.</figDesc></figure>
