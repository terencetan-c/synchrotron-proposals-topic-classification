Le Duc, P. Deman, S. <ref type="bibr">Gil, B. van der Sanden, Y. Prezado</ref> This was a dose escalation study to assess the dose response curves of healthy tissues to MBRT in order to establish the dose tolerance of the rat brain to MBRT. The doses delivered were the same as in the in vitro study MD 398. 60 animals were irradiated in 7 groups of doses In each group:</p><p>• n=3 rats kept alive to assess the survival curve and to study possible adverse symptons. This work is being performed by S. Sarun and Y. Prezado</p><p>• n=6 rats were sacrified 24 hours (3 rats) and 48 hours (3 rats) for histopathological H2AX immunofluorescence studies to assess the quantity of double strand breaks in the DNA. This work is being performed by S. Sarun.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref> shows the survival curves analyzed by G Le Duc at the beginning of April.</p><p>Basically, the higher doses (from 200 Gy on) were not well tolerated and the rats died some days after irradiation. Animals irradiated with peak doses of 50, 100 and 150 Gy present a good general are in good general state. It is not clear why we still have rats at 300 while 200 , 250, 350 and 400 are perfectly coherent.</p><p>healthy rats, minibeams SuYo On the 2 nd of August, the survival rats present a normal behaviour and they are gainning weigth.</p><p>MRI images were taken on the 7 th of Febreuary (24 hours after irradiation), on the 14 th of March ( around 1 month after irradiation) and on the 4 th of July. Anatomical T2 an diffusion sequence (edema) as well as T1 + Gadolinium (blood brain barrier rupture) sequences were used. 24 hours after irradiation the brain presented a normal appereance. However one month after, minibeams are visible in the MRI images for the rats irradiated at 150 Gy indicating a disruption of the blood brain barrier. However the last images taken on the 4 th of July show that this damage has almost been repaired.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: MRI images of one of the rats irradiated at 150 Gy taken one month after (left) and 5 months (right) after the irradiation. The blood brain barrier disruption has almost been repaired.</p><p>The preliminary conclusions of this experiment is that doses as high as 150 Gy (peak dose) in one fraction are well tolerated by the rat brain. This might allow the use of higher and potentially curative doses in clinical cases where the tissues tolerance is limit for conventional therapy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Figure 4.
