<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The black perovskite phase of CsPbI3 is promising for optoelectronic applications; however, it is unstable under ambient conditions, transforming within minutes into an optically inactive yellow phase, a fact that has so far prevented its widespread adoption. Here we use coarse photolithography to decompose and embed an endogenous PbI2-based interfacial microstructure into otherwise-unstable CsPbI3 perovskite thin films and devices. Films fitted with a tessellating microgrid are rendered resistant to moisture-triggered decay and exhibit enhanced long-term stability of the black phase (beyond 2.5 years in a dry environment), due to increasing the phase transition energy barrier and limiting the spread of potential yellow phase formation to structurally isolated domains of the grid. This stabilizing effect is readily achieved at the device level, where unencapsulated CsPbI3 perovskite photodetectors display ambient-stable operation. Through in situ grazing incidence wide angle scattering (GIWAXS) experiments completed at the SNBL BM01 synchrotron beamline at ESRF, the improved thermal-phase stability is directly traced to the interface established in the polycrystalline thin film, a physical response verified by ab initio thermodynamic materials modelling. These findings provide insights into the nature of phase destabilization in emerging CsPbI3 perovskite devices and demonstrates an effective stabilization procedure which is entirely orthogonal to existing approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals:</head><p>The key experimental observation required to complete our thermodynamic model was to directly observed the microgrid/perovskite interface, which acts as a strong stabilizing agent in the thin film. The crystal lattice of CsPbI3 is relatively soft and prone to decompose when exposed to high energy beams, like those employed in electron microscopy experiments. Thus, rather than "zooming in" using microscopy, we aimed to capture the interface via its influence on the direction and distribution of grains (i.e. texture formation) within polycrystalline thin films embedded with the a microgrid. Results: We embed a 3D network of anchoring sites into CsPbI3 thin films to reinforce the desired, functional, perovskite phase. For this, we constructed a tessellating microgrid (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) to form isolated micrometre domains of perovskite and we form films made up of these regions. We employed photolithography to pattern, using top-down (photo)thermal conversion of CsPbI3 into local endogenous deposits of PbI2. Increasing the size of the patterned area easily scales the process to stabilize whole films (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A B</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2|</ref> 1D GIWAXS patterns recorded from as-grown and processed black CsPbI3 thin films (under N2). Structural refinement (Le Bail method) confirms their common orthorhombic perovskite phase.</p><p>The optical properties of the stable perovskite surface are found to remain intact across the processed thin film and a common γ-CsPbI3 polycrystalline structure is preserved (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). However, 2D GIWAXS images reveal the subtle restructuring of the perovskite crystal when it interfaces with the embedded grid (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). The normal polycrystalline thin film texture is altered by the microgrid, confirming additional anisotropy in the system. Taking the (200) peak as an example to make the point, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows how the smooth distribution of the as-grown film (Texture 1) departs when the microgrid is introduced (Texture 2), appearing more irregular, although always superimposing and amplifying narrow regions of Texture 1. The hot spots confirm the presence of a 3D interface throughout the grid. Considering the relative intensity of the two texture components, a quantitative analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) decouples the relative scattering volume from which they originate. We find that at least one third of the film grains are influenced by the anisotropy imposed by the microgrid and, assuming grains bordering the microgrid are most influenced, this suggests grains located far away from the boundary are also driven to express Texture 2. The embedded interface realized via the photolithography is the origin of the added anisotropy, leading directly to the strong stabilizing effect outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Using perovskite photodetectors as a conceptual demonstrator, we show how this approach offers a simple and effective strategy toward ambient processed and stable CsPbI3 optical devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A B</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4|</ref> An evaluation of the relative X-ray scattering contributions arising from the overlap of Textures 1 and 2 recorded from a polycrystalline, black CsPbI3 thin film processed with a 40 μm grid. The GIWAXS beam H×V profile is roughly 50×100 μm at an incident angle of 1°, meaning that the incident footprint encompasses many hundreds of grids. For a given azimuthal angle range, the area under the curve is assumed to be proportional to the scattering volume of crystal domains contributing to that particular texture expression. Texture 1 is shown to be an intrinsic expression of thermally treated CsPbI3 thin film atop glass. Thus, subtracting the Area 1 lineshape from Area 2 we can estimate the relative population of grains influenced to additionally express Texture 2 (introduced by the micro-grid). Through this analysis we arrive at the relative ratio for Texture 1 and 2 of approximately 3:1, which is consistent across multiple samples processed with 40 μm grids. Note that Texture 2 will average out to Texture 1 with a larger enough beam size, this value thus represents the lower bound, with the true value being possibly higher.</p><p>Research outputs: This work was recently published in the high impact journal Nature Communications (impact factor = 14.92).</p><p>Steele, J.
