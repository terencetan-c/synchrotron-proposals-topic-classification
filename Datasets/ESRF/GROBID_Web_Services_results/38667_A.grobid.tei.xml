<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the dynamic behavior of the CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst under working conditions, using as a probe reaction the total oxidation of propane. The experiment consisted of imposing step pulses on the catalytic system using fast switching valves while simultaneously monitoring the reactor effluent as a function of time by on-line mass spectrometry and probing the catalyst's structure using energy dispersive XANES in transmission mode at the copper K edge. In addition to the dynamic response, the catalytic system was allowed to reach its steady state at each reaction temperature and for each reaction mixture.</p><p>To carry out these measurements, an in-situ/operando cell was constructed in our laboratory with a design that resembles the operation of a reactor under plug flow conditions [i] . The "heart" of this experimental cell consists of a quartz capillary tube (ID = 0.9mm, OD = 1mm) mounted horizontally on the setup. The flow sheet of the experimental setup is given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Before starting the reaction experiments, the grounded catalyst (75-100 µm) was loaded in the experimental cell and was generally pre-treated as follows. First, the catalyst was heated under He flow from room temperature to 423 K. Next, the catalyst was kept at 423 K under oxygen flow during approximately one hour. At last, the catalytic system was further heated in a He flow until it reached the first reaction temperature. Depending on the sequence of the step pulses, the isothermal step-response experiments that were carried out can be divided in the following categories: a) He| 2%C 3 H 8 /He : reduction of the catalyst under flow of propane b) He| 10%O 2 /He : re-oxidation of the catalyst under flow of oxygen in He c) He| {1%C 3 H 8 -5 or 10%O 2 }/He : reaction under simultaneous flow of propane and oxygen in He These experiments were performed at four different temperatures (namely 573K, 623K, 673K, 723K) under atmospheric pressure. During the catalytic red/ox cycles a constant flow rate was used (i.e. 1.5 10 -5 mol/s), while under reaction conditions a range of space times (38.3 -127.7 kg s / mol) was obtained by varying the total flow rate (i.e. 0.5-1.5 10 -5 mol/s). The amu's that were followed with the mass spectrometer (MS) during the experiment were <ref type="bibr">4, 12, 14, 18, 28, 29, 32, 41, and 44</ref>. Calibration of the MS was performed with mixtures of non overlaping gas components. To obtain quantitative results from the MS (i.e. gas phase compositions), the analysis procedure of the MS-software (Quadstar TM ) was followed (i.e. method of elimination according to Givens). For the XANES analysis, as the raw XAS data were in pixels of the camera, energy calibration was done using a Cu foil measured in eV (with edge position at 8979 eV). Determination of the edge position, background substraction and normalization of the calibrated raw data was done with Athena [ii] . Moreover, a linear combination fit (LCF) has been applied for the region around the edge (-20 eV to 50 eV) to quantify the ratio of Cu 2+ /Cu 1+ /Cu 0 , using the spectra of the oxidized and reduced catalyst sample (after the treatment with propane) and additionally a Cu 2 O reference taken from another beamline (i.e. BM26).</p><p>No obvious changes were observed in the spectra of the catalyst during heating under He and pre-treating with 10%O 2 /He (see Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Moreover, no changes were witnessed in the XANES spectra during total oxidation reaction conditions (see Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>), indicating that the copper phase remained fully oxidized under such conditions. From the MS analysis of the reactor effluent, propane conversions were obtained at different space times and temperatures (see Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). From the propane conversion versus space time curves, initial reaction rates were calculated at different temperatures, yielding an apparent activation energy for the total oxidation of propane of 70.1 kJ/mol (see Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). Additionally as seen from Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, a higher O 2 /C 3 H 8 molar ratio did not have an effect at the initial reaction rate.</p><p>For the catalytic red/ox cycles the following findings can be reported. The high spectral resolution that was achieved together with the time resolution of ID24 (i.e. 0.1 s) made possible to follow in great detail the transition of Cu 2+ to Cu 0 and to observe the existence of the intermediate Cu 1+ phase (40%max). This was evident from both the evolution of the pre-edge feature and the LCF analysis (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). In Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the conversion of the CuO phase during reduction and the conversion of the Cu phase during re-oxidation is given at all temperatures, as obtained from the LCF analysis. The reoxidation of the catalyst occured much faster (ca. two orders of magnitude) than its reduction for all temperatures and this became more pronounced at lower temperatures. Assuming a first order approximation for the data of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> (i.e. X=1-e -t/τ ), characteristic time constants for the red/ox cycles were obtained at different temperatures, yielding an apparent activation energy for the catalyst's reduction of 70.0 kJ/mol and an apparent activation energy for the catalyst's oxidation of 55.2 kJ/mol (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Therefore, the catalyst's reduction under the applied conditions requires a higher activation energy than the catalyst's oxidation. Finally, it is worth noticing that the activation energy from the MS analysis agrees very well with the activation energy of the LCF analysis for the catalyst's reduction, which indicates that during hydrocarbon oxidation over the CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst the rate determining step is catalytic reduction.
