<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>X-ray magnetic reflectivity (XRMR) opens a direct way to get connection between a charge redistribution and an to clarify the origin of induced magnetic moments on the nonmagnetic atoms like Au, Re, W, Pt etc. in the interface regions with ferromagnetic layers. That was the main goal of the project N° MA-3974: "Interface magnetism and charge transfer in [Co/Au] multilayers".</p><p>At first the x-ray reflectivity curves were measured for Si/[Fe/Re] 20 /Si sample (at energy near L 3 Re absorbtion edge), [Fe/W] 15 /Ni sample (at energy near L 3 W absorbtion edge) and Ti/TbCo film (near L 3 Tb absorbtion edge including XAS measurements) at room temperature without external magnetic field. Model calculations show that a small variation of the electronic density in interfaces can be detected in the reflectivity curves at rather high grazing angles. The obtained reflectivity curves did now show acceptable signal-to-noise ratio and reflectivity measurements at high angles were not reliable.

Grazing angle, deg c) A good signal-to-noise ratio for the reflectivity curve was obtained for the [Co(4.8 nm)/Au(1.2 nm)] 10 /Ti(60 nm)/SiO2/Si sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). So the series of reflectivity curves were measued for a set of energies near L 3 Au absorbtion edge. The main difference of these curves was detected in vicinity of 4 th order Bragg maxima (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). The intensity of this maximum decreases with increasing photon energy that is, with an increase of the absorption by Au atoms. We suppose that a fit of these curves allows us to reconstruct the difference in L 3 XAS spectra for Au atoms in the interfaces and in the middele part of Au layers, however a visible difference in these curves is hardly observed.

(a) Difference of the reflectivity of the two circular polarization of the synchrotron beam for two directions of the external field along the beam, measured in four Bragg peaks from [CoAu] 10 sample for several photon enegies at Au L 3 edge, marked by verticla lines in b).</p><p>The normalized reflectivity difference (I + (θ)-I -(θ))/I maxBr for the right and left circular polarized radiation were measured for the two opposite orientations of the external magnetic field of 2 kOe applied along the beam. The obtained result of the reflectivity difference near 4 Bragg maxima for 5 energies near L 3 absorbtion edge are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Reflectvities were measured at short angular intervales due to the unstable positions of the incident beam (or the sample position ?). The unstable beam position can shift the sample adjustment even in short time, so we are not sure that the dispersive shape of some asymmetries is caused by the interference of magnetic contriutions but not by the shft of the angle. The obserbed reflectivity difference did not show the expected opposite sifgn. The possible shapeof the difference will be checked by model calculaitons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In summary:</head><p>The desired peculiarities of the reflectivity curve (needed for the depth resolved resonant L 2,3 Au spectra with atomic layer resolution), measured as a function of the photon energy in vicinity of the L 2,3 Au absorption edges, were not observed. For the detecting a charge redistribution between Au and Co atoms in the interface regions this kind of measurements had not shown a suffisient accuracy.</p><p>The measurements directly show the existence of the induced magnetic moments on the Au atoms in the investigated [Co(4.8 nm)/Au(1.2 nm)] 10 structure. However, the detailed analysis of the obtained asymmetry ratio for the depth distribution visualization of the Au magnetic moments needs the additional measurements with higher accuracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Photon energy (eV)</figDesc></figure>
