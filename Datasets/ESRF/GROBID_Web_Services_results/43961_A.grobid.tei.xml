<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have previously developed a protocol for the in situ monitoring of microbial metal redox transformations under pressure using X-ray absorption spectroscopy 1 . We have successfully used this protocol for the study of pressure effects on dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) by the piezosensitive bacterium Shewanella oneidensis 2 . Following those previous successful experiments, the goal of experiment EC-668 was to investigate the effects of high pressure on DIR by a piezophilic (i.e. adapted to pressure) bacterium related to Shewanella oneidensis MR-1: the deep-sea piezophilic bacterium Shewanella profunda LT13a 3 . During the 6 days of experiment, kinetics of DIR by strain LT13a were measured at 0.1, twice at 10, 50, 60 and 80 MPa (30°C) using 3 mM Fe(III) and a cell concentration of ca. 10 9 cells/ml.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice of the bacterial strain :</head><p>Shewanella profunda LT13a was selected because it has the same pressure range for growth than strain MR-1 (0-50 MPa) but an optimal pressure for growth shifted at 10 MPa (vs 0.1 MPa for strain MR-1) 3 . Both strains have the same temperature optimum of 30°C. Indeed, one fundamental question is to know if the pressure limit for metabolic activity is dependent on the pressure optimum for growth. We used the M1 culture medium composed of a mineral solution, 100 mM HEPES buffer, 0.2 g/l yeast extract, 2 g/l peptone and ferric citrate at 3 mM (terminal electron acceptor). Strain LT13a was grown in rich medium, harvested in stationary phase and used to prepare cell suspensions at ca. 10 9 cells/ml in the M1 medium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions of measurements :</head><p>Acquisition of XANES spectra at the Fe K-edge was performed similarly to previous experiments (experimental reports 30-02-869 and 30-02-945). The spectra were acquired between 7.06 and 7.50 keV in 147 points of 1s each, hence minimizing the irradiation of the bacteria 4 . A culture irradiated during the acquisition of 20 XANES spectra shows a survival rate of 83.5 % at ambient pressure when the nonirradiated control displays a survival rate of 91.8 %.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pressure range explored during the experiment :</head><p>The pressure and temperature conditions were obtained by using the same autoclave as before. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> We used 1.5 mm-Be windows in the autoclave. This setup limited the pressure to 80 MPa. But it is necessary since the thicker 4.5-mm Be windows allowing higher pressure prevent the measurement of 3 mM Fe because of the 0.08% Fe(0) impurities they contain. There is an ongoing experimental development to design really pure windows for the autoclave that would allow measurements with very low iron concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temperature control in the autoclave :</head><p>We observed at ambient pressure in the autoclave slower iron reduction rate than in the control experiments performed in the laboratory. This indicated a posteriori a possible discrepancy between the regulated temperature (30°C) and the actual temperature in the autoclave (24-25°C). The precision of temperature regulation is critical for microbial cultures since they respond very severely to small changes of temperature.</p><p>In the next experiment, we will give special attention to this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis :</head><p>The XANES spectra were processed using the interactive graphical utility ATHENA (Ravel B. &amp; Newville M., 2005, J. Synchrotron Rad., 12:4, 537-541) and its linear combination module. Experimental spectra could always be fitted by a combination of soluble Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ standard spectra (measured during the experimental run as well).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results :</head><p>They are summarized in table 1, and displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The ability of LT13a to reduce Fe 3+ decreases linearly with pressure and is estimated (linear extrapolation) to stop at ca. 180 MPa. The decrease in Fe(III) reduction extent is correlated with a decrease in survival. The first part of the experiment was successful despite some problems with the regulation of temperature and the limitation of pressure.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives:</head><p> go to higher pressures to determine pressure limit in DIR by Shewanella Profunda.  improve the reliability of temperature regulation.</p><p> compare the results obtained on the piezosensitive Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and the piezophilic Shewanella Profunda LT13a to derive a more general model.</p><p>References: 1 A.
