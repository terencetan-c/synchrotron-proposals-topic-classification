<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to see if, for photons tuned to the Sb K-edge (E = 30.491 keV), resonant Xray scattering (RXS) occurred in USb associated with its antiferromagnetic (AF) order. This followed earlier experiments on other (AF) U systems, which observed RXS at K-edges of non-magnetic ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, and a theory to account for these effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The situation making USb "new" was that Sb is a 5p ion, while the non-magnetic ions in the previous (RXS) studies had all been 4p <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In addition, to our knowledge, a RXS experiment had never been attempted at such a "hard" X-ray energy (E = 30.491 keV); the previous K-edges investigated where at energies between 10 and 13 keV <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Given that the Sb K edge falls just above the low-E cut-off (~ 30 keV) of the spectrum of (dipole) radiation "viewed" by ID15A -with the maximum flux occurring at around 60 keV -and that USb has a magnetic structure commensurate (with k = 1 r.l.u.) with its (fcc) crystal structure, it was a priority in our experiment to minimize the contamination of any RXS (which would occur at the magnetic satellite positions, (hkl) mixed integer) by higher-order (charge) scatter. In order to maximize the λ:λ/n ratio in the scattered beam, the thinnest (Laue) crystal available at ID15A (a Ge (311) crystal) was employed as the second monochromator, and an analyser crystal was not used. A Ge solid state detector was opted for, to allow for discrimination betwen the signal of interest (λ) and unwanted, higher-order scattering (λ/n).</p><p>A relatively large (1 x 1 x 2 mm 3 ) single crystal of USb was mounted on the 4-circle diffractometer of ID15A, in a displex cryostat (borrowed from the XMaS beamline). The Sb-K energy was calibrated, in the standard way, by recording the fluorescence yield from the sample. Shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is the Sb K α "partial" fluorescence yield, obtained by "windowing" (in the MCA of the Ge detector) a range enclosing the Sb K α1,2 photon energies. Two data-sets are shown, recorded successively, the first measurement being that with the "crude" (i.e. larger) energy step-size. One observes inconsistency between these different "runs", the two curves being offset by 8 eV. We attribute this discrepency to position irreproducibility in the stepping motors controlling the Bragg angle of the monochromator crystals -a positioning error of +/-8 eV.</p><p>Setting the incident X-ray energy to the Sb K-edge energy (we used the value obtained from the second fluorescence run, bearing in mind a repositioning error of +/-8 eV), a single-crystal alignment was performed, at base temperature (T = 10 K). We then searched for RXS at the magnetic position (005); we chose this position as it was the satellite of largest scattering angle available within a hard limit (2θ max ) of (approximately) 17 °. Sample-rocking (Ω) scans were performed through (005) as a function of the incident X-ray energy, tuning through the Sb K edge using various choices of energy step-sizes, from 1 to 10 eV, to combat the problem of energy setting error (∆E ~ 8 eV). We found an Ω dependence of scattering in λ (the MCA channels covering an energy window of 30 to 31 keV were designated as the "λ" signal) to appear as the edge was approached, with a peaked-form of the dependence consistent (from its FWHM (in Ω)) with it</p></div>

However, the E dependence of the (Ω) integrated intensity of the λ signal did not follow the usual lorentzian form, leading to us to doubt that we had observed RXS. To investigate the development (with E) of this Ω-dependent signal in λ, we collected, as a function of (Ω,E), the entire MCA output (this corresponded to an E range spanning 10 to 200 keV). Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the most dramatic situation encounted in our acquisition of MCA output, obtained with E set (nominally) at the edge (= 30.491 keV) and Ω set to the (005) position: the higher-order scattering (λ/n) is a maximum and gives rise to a broad signal at and around the λ position (see inset of figure). The intensity of this (parasitic) signal was found to scale with the intensities of the high-order (diffraction) signals; away from the diffraction condition(s), a peak due to Sb K α fluorescence could be identified, but in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (inset) this signal is lost in the noise of the (parasitic) signal. This explained the (Ω,E) dependences we had observed (see above) when looking only at λ (integrated channel) signal. Our search for RXS was thus rendered (technically) impossible due to lack of necessary sensitivity, at the energy of interest, caused by higher-order (charge) scattering.</p><p>We conclude that any future search for RXS (from such a commensurately ordered system as USb) at these energies (~ 30 keV) should strive to minimize further than was possible to do so in this study the effect of higher-order scattering. The use of a Ge solid-state detector (energy resolution around 100 eV) has been shown to be insufficient for such higher-order discrimination, even when the total sum (i.e. all photon energies) of scatter in the detector never exceeded the nominal saturation limit of 10,000 (total) count/sec. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Entire MCA output of the Ge detector, obtained at the (005) magnetic position, with the incident X-ray energy beam tuned to the Sb K-edge. The peaks labeled "λ/2" and "λ/4" denote higher order charge scattering (namely, the (0,0,10) and (0,0,20) Bragg reflections, respectively). The inset shows a close-up of the energy region around the principal harmonic "λ", i.e. where RXS would be found. Instead of observing RXS, a large "background", continuous in energy between channel numbers 50 (minimum energy detectable) and 200 is present. This background intensity was found to scale with the intensity of the higher-order scattering.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
