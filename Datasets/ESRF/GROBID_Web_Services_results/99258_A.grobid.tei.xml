<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experiment HC-4781</p><p>We collected successfully PXRD patterns of the 5 MOF compunds at several distinct temperatures, down to liquid He temperature, as programmed in the approved proposal.</p><p>We mainly focused on the study of two novel isoreticular Al-based MOFs which contain apolar and dipolar bicyclopentane molecular rotors, respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for these 2 samples were collected from 298 K down to 4 K using a He cryostat available at ID-22 beamline. Sample stability under synchrotron radiation was tested and an optimised measurement protocol was established to ensure data consistency along the measurements. Data collections were performed at more than 15 different temperatures.</p><p>The PXRD data collected at the various temperatures allowed the crystal structure refinement by the Rietveld method: the results supported the modeling of the rotor conformation and its dependence with temperature. Specifically, the results allowed the identification and refinement of a complex and unprecedented behaviour of the polar molecular rotors at very low temperatures, that lead to the discovery of an order-disorder transition accompanied by a change in the motional regime in the solid state. PXRD results collected at syncrothron source strongly corroborate the rotor dynamic studied with solid state NMR in the same temperature range and supported DFT calculations to clarify the correlated motional mechanism. Moreover, the results provided fundamental insights in the breathing mechanism of MOF structures at very low temperatures. The results are reported in an upcoming paper (under revision in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.). The abstract is reported below.</p><p>Abstract. Dynamics of dipolar rotors in solid matter is still a challenge as Coulombic interactions and hydrogen-bonding occurring in polar systems conflict with molecular reorientation, especially at extremelylow temperatures. The synthesis of Al-based MOFs, comprising a wheel-shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorines, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2K, with practically null activation energies (Ea=0.017 kcal/mol). The unprecedented rotor dynamics of dipoles was measured over a wide temperature range (2K-300K) by 1 H-NMR relaxation times, which revealed multiple distinct configurations and attempt frequencies typical of correlated rotor dynamics. A synergistic approach comprising synchrotron radiation XRD at 4K, DFT, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape of configurations and pointed out a cascade mechanism running throughout the structures, which converts dipole configurations into each other. Gas accessibility, shown by HP-Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 entering the channels triggers dipole reorientation, hampering their collective motion and stimulating a change of dipole configuration from disorder to order. Dynamic materials under conditions of limited thermal noise and high responsiveness facilitate the fabrication of molecular machines and controllable chemical and physical properties.</p><p>We collected for comparison the PXRD pattern of corresponding MOFs based on the same lignds and Zr 4+ ions at room temperature and at 100 K to determine and refine the unit cell and model a reference disordered structure of BCP units inside these materials. The structural determination and refinement was interesting and promoted the discovery of ultra-fast molecular rotors modulated by disorder: the results are going to be submitted soon.</p><p>Moreover, the collection of PXRD pattern of a Hf-based MOF comprising highly luminescent ligands allowed the refinement of its crystal structure, fundamental for the evaluation of the empty volume enclosed inside the unit cell. The data will appear in an upcoming paper, to be published.</p></div>		</body>
