<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Actinide-based mono-and mixed-nitrides (UN, ThN, {UxThx-1}N), are at the forefront of advanced technology fuel (ATF) research and development. The requirement for an ATF material is to outperform the current UO2zirconium alloy fuel-clad system under normal operating conditions, and in the event of an accident, for example, a loss-of-coolant-accident, an event which occurred during the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. In addition to their use in generation-III light-water reactors (LWRs), the nitride-based actinide fuels are also considered for use in next-generation high-temperature gas reactors as the fuel kernel for the TRISO concept.</p><p>The UN and ThN mononitrides, and (U,Th)N composites have gained interest due to their increased fissile density and improved thermal properties compared to UO2, benefiting the overall performance of the nuclear reactor. A thorium-based fuel has further advantages over the uranium fuels due to the production of U-233 when Th-232 undergoes neutron absorption, resulting in a more efficient fission process in the thermal energy regime, as well as the high natural abundance of thorium in the Earth's crust.</p><p>If these proposed ATFs are to be implemented into the nuclear fuel cycle, it is vital for the aqueous corrosion behaviour of each phase to be investigated. There is the potential for fuel components to come into contact with aqueous environments in and ex operando, therefore assessing the structural and chemical evolution of fuel phases within such scenarios is imperative to our knowledge.</p><p>The experiments performed at the XMaS beamline aimed to investigate the aqueous corrosion behaviour of mixed-actinide oxide and nitride surfaces. Using the XMaS beamline, it was possible to conduct an in situ x-ray diffraction investigation into these corrosion mechanisms, utilising the synchrotron as both a radiation source to drive radiolytic corrosion and a measurement probe to determine the phases present during and after corrosion, giving a unique insight into this important reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Results</head><p>During our allocated beamtime, we were able to assess the effect of radiolytic species at the surface of eight mixed-actinide phases with varied stoichiometries. This has allowed us to understand the effect of adding thorium into uranium nitride (UN) and uranium oxide (UO2) systems and how the dissolution behaviour changes as a function of thorium content. From previous studies, conducted by Bright et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> it was found that [001]oriented UN oxidises to form topotactic U2N3 and UO2. It was therefore a priority to assess the mixed-actinide oxide phases (ThO2)x(UO2)1-x, as these systems will be the primary oxidation phase forming at the surface of [001]-UN and [001]-oriented (ThN)x(UN)1-x.</p><p>The first set of measurements taken replicated the previous dissolution measurements conducted by Springell et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, where the thin film sample is held within a surface tension cell (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). Once in place, MilliQ water is injected into the cell and, at a grazing incidence angle, incident photons radiolyse the water allowing for dissolution at the surface of the sample. . This rate is of the same order as the dissolution rate calculated by Bright et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (0.02 Ås -1 ), suggesting a good agreement with literature. What must be stressed here is the data collected by Bright et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was from nano-crystalline thin films, suggesting that any differences in the dissolution rate could be linked to crystallite orientation. A further study into the effect of radiolytic species on the [110] and [111] surfaces of UN would be beneficial to furthering our understanding of the corrosion behaviour of UN.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Lottie Harding* -University of Bristol Eleanor Lawrence Bright* -ESRF, Grenoble Florence Legg* -University of Bristol Phil Smith* -University of Bristol Ross Springell* -University of Bristol</figDesc></figure>

The pristine UN sample is shown with a pink solid line, with the final exposure dataset shown with purple.Minimal changes happen to the fringes situated between Q = 0.15 -0.4, this is because these particular fringes stem from the Nb buffer layer which is the epitaxial matching layer between r-plane Al2O3 and UN. The extracted layer thicknesses are presented on the right. The total thickness lost from the [001]-UN sample was approximately 38 Å, suggesting a dissolution rate of 0.013 Ås -1 .

(Right) Thicknesses extracted from XRR data, total (black squares), UN (pink circles), and UO2 (blue triangles). Total dissolution rate calculated to be approximately 0.013 As -1 . The second phase of experiments conducted on XMaS utilised the epitaxial match of Al2O3 r-plane /[001] Nb/ [001] UN. The samples deposited upon r-plane Al2O3 has a unique feature of a 2.5° miscut, causing the [010] reflection to lie 2.5° away from the plane of the film surface. The &lt;010&gt; reflections can therefore be measured in a grazing incidence reflection geometry, which is ideal for driving radiolytic corrosion. As the surface UO2 and intermediate U2N3 layers are shown to form topotatically on UN, all in the [001] orientation [1], these reflections can also be measured using the same geometry. For this experiment, we utilised a 2D detector to measure the relative intensity from the [111] type reflections of UN and UO2. The integrated intensities gathered from the reflections is presented in Fig 3. This part of the experiment allowed for the dissolution of epitaxial UN to be measured in situ. From the data collected, it is clear that the relative intensity of the (222) UN reflection decreases as a function of exposure time, whereas the intensity of the (222) UO2 reflection appears to stay almost constant. This could be suggesting that the oxidation products are continuously replenished resulting in the oxidation of UN to UO2.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,140.20,514.23,333.35,237.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this experiment, the aqueous dissolution of mixed (<rs type="affiliation">U,Th</rs>) oxides and nitrides was measured using x-ray reflectivity techniques. The advantage of using synchrotron radiation for this experiment, is that the incident photons can be used as a source to radiolyse water and as a probe to measure changes to the sample surface. Data presented in this report indicated the dissolution rate of [001]-oriented UN within a MilliQ water environment is slower when compared to values previously presented, suggesting there is a crystallite orientation dependence on the dissolution of UN. Probing the corrosion behaviours of (U,Th) oxide systems has further benefited our corrosion models for the mixed-nitride systems.</p><p>Using the unique epitaxial match of Al2O3/UN, in-plane Bragg reflections were monitored in situ (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), allowing for a deeper insight into the corrosion mechanism of UN. The confirmation that this particular method works, has opened up another avenue of work with regards to investigating the corrosion behaviour of epitaxial UN and (Th,U)N systems.</p></div>
