The structures of Tc and Np complexes generated during a reaction between Tc species at selected oxidation states and Np(III and VI) ions were studied by means of EXAFS at ROBL line. 6 samples containing a mixture of Tc and Np compounds and reference samples containing initially Tc(IV) or TcO 4 -were prepared at HZDR in Dresden. The Tc K-edge EXAFS spectra were recorded for all solutions using a fluorescence detector. The energy scales for XANES scans for Tc and Np were calibrated with Mo (Mo K-edge at 20000 eV) and Y (Y K-edge at 17038 eV) metals foils, respectively. The spectra of Tc compounds in the samples containing initially Tc(IV) and Tc(III,IV) species with addition of NpO 2 2+ show an inflection point of preedge absorption pe ak at 21044 eV, a feature characteristic for pertechnetates. Data fitting was applied in further analysis of the results. Tc was surrounded by 4 oxygen atoms (N = 3.9) at a distance of 1.74 Å (σ 2 = 0.0010 Å 2 ). Obtained results confirmed TcO 4 -structure. The results of the experiments show that in strongly acidic media the pertechnetates are reduced by Np(III) to technetium(IV) species while Np(III)</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>) ions are generated probably by a disproportionation of Np(V) ions, the latter species are unstable products of Tc(VII)-Np(III) interaction. An analysis of the samples containing various concentrations of technetium and fixed concentration of neptunium in acidic media confirms a multistep pathway of Tc(red)-Np(ox) interaction.</figDesc></figure>
