<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XANES/EXAFS/WAXS study of the activation of Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts</head><p>In preparation of the beamtime it was decided to include the WAXS facilities that beamline 26A has in the research. As Fe-based FT catalysts show changes in bulk composition during activation and reaction, using WAXS in combination with XAS can provide important complementary information on the bulk state of the catalysts.</p><p>Three different Fe-based catalysts; bulk α-Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 /CuO/K 2 O/ZnO and Fe 2 O 3 /CuO/K 2 O/SiO 2 , were studied under identical conditions. The catalysts were heated to 250 o C in a mixture of 5% H 2 /He and 5% CO/He, while WAXS and XANES data were recorded continuously. During reaction, reaction products were monitored using a mass spectrometer. After different FT reaction times, EXAFS data was collected in the quick EXAFS mode.</p><p>Unfortunately, the catalyst systems behaved different than expected and only very small changes were observed in the WAXS and XAS data, even after prolonged reaction times (~4 h) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). As the FT reaction rate is first order in the partial pressure of H 2 , this was most probably the result of the use of dilute gases. The analysis of reaction products, however, showed that there was still some catalytic activity of the samples, giving a strong indication that bulk species are not necessary for the catalysts to be active in the FT reaction.</p><p>Overall, the quality of the recorded XAS and WAXS data was very good and new insights were gained into the catalytic system. The project will be continued in the beamtime in the fall of 2007 (proposal 26-01-788), applying the new insights and experience gained from this run. Ex situ analysis of reference materials and spent catalysts WAXS/XANES/EXAFS data was recorded on Fe 2 O 3 , Fe 3 O 4 , Fe x C and Fe reference materials, as well as on some previously used catalyst samples. The data quality was excellent and therefore it is to be expected that some of these results will be used in future publications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Although the experiments did not yield the expected results, important new insights were gained into the catalytic system. Overall, the user support on the beamline was outstanding and we are confident that the planned future experiments will be successful.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Dr Sergey NIKITENKO (e-mail: nikitenko@esrf.fr) Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Emiel de Smit, dr.

The largest part of the time was spent on collecting in situ data during the activation and reaction of the catalysts. The remainder of the time was spent on ex situ analysis of reference materials and spent catalysts.</figDesc></figure>
