<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to check the hypothesis that superconductivity (SC) and charge density wave (CDW) in 2H-TaSe2 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD ) are in strong exclusive relations and thus shed light on the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena. The idea was to employ high-pressure x-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the position of the quantum critical point (QCP), i.e. to find the critical pressure Pc at which the CDW transition temperature T CDW suppressed to zero, and complete the P -T phase diagram of 2H-TaSe2 in the pressure range passing through and beyond the QCP. Comparing the behavior of the CDW and earlier published SC transition temperature Tc [2] with pressure, we can confirm or disprove the assumption that the pressure at which Tc reaches its maximum corresponds to the Pc of the QCP. This compound was previously intensively studied by means of XRD [1], susceptibility and resistance measurements <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. Under ambient pressure 2H-TaSe2 adopts the hexagonal (P63/mmc) structure at T &gt; TCDW = 121 K. The published phase diagram, obtained from resistivity and susceptibility measurements [3], is shown in the inset to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The phase diagram illustrates CDW suppression with pressure along with a monotonic increase in the SC Tc. The SC dome reaches its maximum at Tc = 8 K at P = 23 GPa. Unfortunately, the signature of the CDW transition in the resistivity data vanishes at higher pressures and TCDW (red triangles) could only be assessed up to 20 GPa. Thus, the position of a possible CDW QCP has not been determined prior to our experiment. A simple extrapolation of the data indicates that the Pc value for QCP is around 30 GPa or even higher, which is far from 23 GPa for the maximum SC Tc. In order to measure the position of the QCP with high accuracy and therefore test the hypothesis of a strong exclusive relationship between SC and CDW in this material, we performed high pressure XRD measurements. Our data show the behaviour of the CDW with pressure up to its complete suppression.</p><p>The crystals for this experiment were grown using the vapor growth technique in the group of K. Rossnagel (University of Kiel, Germany) and the high-quality and polytype purity of the 2H phase of our 2H-TaSe2 crystals were verified by the previous elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering experiments at APS. The experiment was performed at the ID15B beamline with 30 keV energy of the incoming beam. For the effective detection of the scattered photons the large area EIGER2 X 9M CdTe (340x370 mm) flat panel detector was used. For high pressure XRD measurements, we prepared two small samples (in-plane &lt; 50 µm, out-of-plane &lt; 20 µm) suitable for a diamond anvil cell (DAC) measurements in the desired pressure range 10 -35 GPa. Each sample was mounted in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), loaded with helium as a pressure transmitting medium. Pressure was varied in situ using a helium-pressurized membrane and monitored by the ruby fluorescence technique. The XRD measurements were done on a single crystals of 2H-TaSe2 between room temperature and 2 K, and for pressures ranging from 0.19 to 30.27 GPa.</p><p>Typical diffraction patterns measured at T = 40 K and different pressures are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The signature of a CDW in 2H-TaSe2 is a presence of order reflections at wave vectors 𝒒 ⃗ ⃗ CDW = ±(1 -δ)𝒂 ⃗ ⃗ * /3, where 𝒂 ⃗ ⃗ * denotes the reciprocal lattice vector of the 2H-TaSe2 hexagonal lattice structure. Data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (a) was measured at P = 6.17 GPa, here one can see six commensurate reflections 𝒒 ⃗ ⃗ CCDW = (1/3 0 0) hex surrounding structural (1 0 0) Bragg peak related to the hexagonal symmetry of the high-temperature structure. Here, we find 𝛿 = 0, i.e., a commensurate CDW order. The pattern shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 (b</ref>) and measured at a higher pressure P = 14.529 GPa reveals an incommensurate CDW with 𝒒 ⃗ ⃗ ICDW ≈ (0.31 0 0) hex or δ ≈ 0.066. Data shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">(c</ref>) was taken at even higher pressure of 19.47 GPa where the CDW is suppressed at 40 K. The high quality of the crystals enabled us to perform measurements up to pressures as high as 30 GPa, and to complete the phase diagram of 2H-TaSe2 in its most critical regime where the CDW is suppressed to zero temperature by hydrostatic pressure, confirming for the first time the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) at P c ≈ 24 GPa. The resulting phase diagram, shown on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>., summarizes all the points measured during this experiment. At ambient pressure it consists of an incommensurate CDW (ICDW, red dots) below 122 K and a subsequent lock-in transition to a commensurate CDW (CCDW, blue triangles) below 90 K. With an increase in pressure at low temperatures, the commensurate phase undergoes a transition into an incommensurate one. Rising even higher in pressure, the system undergoes a lock-in transition and again enters a commensurate phase. From our measurements, we can make a preliminary conclusion that the maximum of the SC dome at Tc = 8 K strongly correlates with the QCP of the CDW which lies in the range 23 -24.7 GPa.  In summary, we performed high-resolution pressure-dependent x-ray diffraction measurements investigating the P -T phase diagram of CDW order in 2H-TaSe2 TMD single crystals. At the end of the experiment, all the goals indicated in the proposal were achieved. The experiment revealed the details of a rich T-P phase diagram characterized by the interplay of commensurate and incommensurate CDW orders, and for the first time established the existence of a QCP at 24 GPa, where the CDW is completely suppressed by hydrostatic pressure. The obtained results indicate a strong exclusive relationship between the CDW and SC cooperative electron phenomena in <ref type="bibr">2H-TaSe2. 1. Ph.
