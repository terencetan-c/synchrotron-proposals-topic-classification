<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: (max. 2 pages)</head><p>The experiment was devoted to the study of structure and order of the Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) membranes, which are prepared by the two-step anodization technique. An extended set of samples with different radii of the pores and different periodicity was prepared to study the influence of the preparation procedure on the structure and order of the membrane. This experiment was performed using the microradian setup, which was built and aligned during the preceding experiment 26-02-392. This allowed us to save a significant amount of beamtime. In this report we shall present a few preliminary results of the experiment.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> shows a microradian diffraction pattern measured from an Al 2 O 3 membrane of about 80 µm of thickness, with about 35 nm of pore's diameter and about 100 nm of distance between the pores. The diffraction pattern is identified as one scattered from the 2-dimentional hexagonal lattice of the channels. Up to forth-order reflections have been clearly detected, suggesting the presence of strong correlations in the channel positions over significant distances. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> presents the q-dependence of the scattered intensities (after subtraction of the detector offset of I off = 97.19 cpp/s) with the wavevector q parallel to the principal orientations ( <ref type="formula">10</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), respectively. The positions of the peaks (q 10 = 0.0696 nm -1 , q 11 = 0.1205 nm -1 and q 20 = 0.139 nm -1 ) correspond very well to the hexagonal order of pores with the distance of 105 nm between them. The radial profile of the diffraction peaks (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) has a Lorentzian shape and its half-width δq = 0.004 nm -1 corresponds to a correlation length of the hexagonal structure that spreads over a distance of δL ~ π/δq = 800 nm. One can see that in spite of a rather large-scale periodicity of the structure, the microradian setup is able to resolve the peak profile in great detail. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>, the hexagonal interchannel order is extended</p><p>0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 1 10 100 1000 (23) (12) (10) (11) Intensity, cpp/s q, nm -1 (10) (11) (21) (22) (40) (20) (30) (32) B 0 60 120 180 240 300 360 0 100 200 300 400 Intensity, arb.un.

One can also see a significant broadening of the peaks in the azimuthal direction (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>), which is induced by fluctuations of the bond-orientational order. The Half-Width at Half-Maximum of the (10)-reflections runs in the azimuthal direction is about 8 degrees for reflections of different order. The intensities of the reflections are found to be related as: I 10 : I 11 : I 20 : I 21 : I 30 = 37 : 14 : 9 : 2.7 : 1. Furthermore, the diffraction pattern was found to be very sensitive to the sample orientation. Sample rotation by as little as a fraction of a degree can significantly affect the relative peak intensities.</p><p>To demonstrate that the x-ray diffraction in the alumina membranes is very strong and switches to the dynamic regime, several patterns were measured without the beamstop to allow for a direct comparison between the direct beam and the diffracted peaks (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Although the direct beam seems to be much brighter, one has to take into account that the power scattered into the six &lt;10&gt; reflections is distributed over much larger area on the detector. Our preliminary estimates show that the integrated intensity of one of the (10) reflection is 9.5 times larger (almost tenfold!) than that the rest of the direct beam. Moreover, we found that sample rotations, which reduce the intensity of the diffracted peaks, lead to an increase of the direct beam intensity by as much as 62(!) times. This clearly shows that the diffraction is in a highly dynamic regime. Interestingly, the direct beam passed through the sample has a profile, which is distinctly different from that of the direct beam (measured after passing through a thin aluminium plate to reduce its intensity). The two profiles are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> b. One can clearly see that not only the diffracted peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 c</ref>), but also the direct beam broadens. This can be related to fluctuations of the density of the channels in the membrane on the scale much larger than the structure period. At the same time, the dynamic character of the diffraction can also play a role. More data analysis and further experimental studies are needed to clarify this direct beam broadening.</p><p>In addition, we have performed a preliminary in-situ study of the channel growth process during electrochemical reaction. Unfortunately, due to the beamtime limitations we did not manage to vary the xray photon energy in order to vary the scattering contrast in our samples. We hope to perform such a study in our future experiments.</p><p>Finally, we would like to thank our local contact Dr Kristina Kvashnina and Dirk Detollenaere for their excellent support. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The beam size at the sample was determined by the aperture of the compound refractive lens (about 1 millimeter).</p><p>300 350 400 450 500 0 10 20 30 40 Intensity Position C 700 800 900 0 200 400 B Intensity Position (detector pixel) 10 1 100 A 10</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1 Microradian diffraction pattern from a 50 microns thick alumina membrane (A).
