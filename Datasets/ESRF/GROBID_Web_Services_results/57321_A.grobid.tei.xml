<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this proposal we wanted to study in operando conditions the chemical and structral changes occuring during the steam reforming of ethanol on nanocatalysts based on ferrites with different dopants (Co x Mn y Fe 2 O 4 ). In particular, the steam reforming is achieved using a thermochemical loop that consists in the sequential dosing of ethanol and water, which therefore determine reduction and oxidation cycles in the materials. By using QuickEXAFS on the Fe, Mn, and Co K edge, we wanted to follow the kinetics of the phase transformations induced by ethanol, during which the ferrites are transformed to more reduced oxides and eventually metal phases. Similarly, we wanted to investigate the oxidation process of the reduced form of the catalysts operated by water, with the aim of identifying the possible formation of different oxide phases, mixed oxides, and hydroxides. The in operando Quick EXAFS measurements were carried out in flourescence mode at the Fe K, and Co K edges. The samples in powder form were diluted with boron nitride (mass ratio=1:1.2) and inserted in quartz capillaries (diameter=1.5 mm, wall thickness=0.03 mm) that were connected to a heated gas line. Ethanol and water were dosed by saturators and using nitrogen as carrier gas. The samples were heated from RT to 450Â°C by a hot wall furnace. Unfortunately, we had several problems with the gas dosing system of the beamline, probably due to air (?) leaks in the connections of the saturators. We passed most of the beamtime trying to figure out what was the problem, and when we solved this issue, it was too late to complete all the planned experiments: we could properly dose ethanol and water only on one sample (CoFe 2 O 4 ). Moreover, there was a problem with the mass spectometer (gas line obstructed?), so we could not follow the gas products of the thermochemical loop during the EXAFS measurements. After 2 hours of ethanol exposure, the material was completely reduced: both Fe (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>) and Co (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>) K edges XANES and EXAFS confirmed the formation of metallic phases. Interestingly, the Co reduced (metal?) phase was stable and the successive oxidative cycle in water did not affected significantly the material. Conversely, in the case of Fe K-edge we could observe that after 2 hours of water dosing Fe was reoxidized, though not as much as in the starting material. T hanks to the QuickEXAFS, during the 2 hours of ethanol exposure we were able to follow carefully the kinetics of reduction. In fact, we measured a XANES spectra at the Co K-edge every 133 seconds (for sake of simplicity, in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> are not plotted all the spectra aquired, but just one in four). The Co K-edge white line started to strongly decrease its intensity after about 15 minutes and Co is completely reduced after about 100 minutes. Unfortunately, due to the experimental problems discussed above, we couldn't exploit all the potentiality of the QuickEXAFS during this beamtime. Therefore, the data collected during this beamtime are not sufficient to understand the effect of a different dopant on the reduction/oxidation mechanism of different ferrites as planned in the proposal. Nonetheless, we were able to point out a quite different behaviour between Fe and Co, observing a quite surprising resiliance of Co towards reoxidation by water. This same experiment was also attempted at the ROCK beamline at SOLEIL synchrotron. Capitalizing on the knowledge acquired at BM23, we have adopted a different experimental set up for dosing ethanol, methanol and water in the capillaries, which exploited syringe pumps. Thanks to these devices, we avoided the problems that we had with the saturators and were able to dose a higher (and more accurate) amount of the desired liquid reactant (i.e. reaching the complete reduction of CoFe 2 O 4 in 20 instead of 2 hours). Therefore, we were able to exploit the potentiality of the QuickEXAFS: we investigated the reduction kinetics of different ferrites and we carefully followed the phases that are formed during the reduction and during the reoxidation cycles.</p><p>In conclusion, we regret having so many experimental problems related to the gas lines, because we are rather confident that without this issue, we could have obtained many data from this beamtime. Actually, we verify that the time resolution of the QuickEXAFS is adequate to follow the kinetic of reduction/oxidation of our catalysts in working conditions. Moreover, the difference in the EXAFS spectra are rather obvious and quite distinctive of the different phases, therefore the use of this technique carried out in a more controlled reaction environment could have represente an ideal tool for following the oxidation and reduction phase transformation.</p></div>
