<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>EXPERIMENTAL Several grasping spines from Sagitta gazellae, a gigantic Antarctic arrow worm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) were prealigned with X-rays, using a Philips 1720 X-ray generator equipped with a Warhus camera. In these spines, strips of well aligned fragments were cut with a sharp scalpel. Typical fragments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> and 2B) had about 0.5mm in length for a width of 20 ~mandathickne ssofca.5~m. The fragments were glued on glass fibers in such a way that the chitin fiber axis was roughly aligned with the glass fiber axis. The chitin fragments were analyzed by synchrotron radiation on microfocus beamline ID13, using alO~m X-ray beam (k= O.6877~) obtained with an ellipsoidal mirror and post-collimated by a 10 ~m pinhole collimator. The flux of photons at the sample was around 10'eph/s, The samples were oscillated around their long axes. Exposures of 200 seconds were used with oscillations ranging from 3.5 to 2째. Diagrams (exemplified in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>) were recorded with a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD camera located at a distance of 49.9 mm from the sample. The X-ray recordings were analyzed with the DENZO program. Due to overlaps, such absences could not be identified along a*. Thus the space group has to be selected between P212 121 and P22121. A problem was encountered as the various intensity peaks had a fairly large spread (at least 10째) leading to peak overlaps. This is particularly the case in the diagrams in the a*c* orientation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>) were the strong peaks 110, 120, 130 and perhaps 100 overlap one another. In order to achieve a refinement of the structure of a chitin, one needs therefore either to record X-ray diagram on better (and may be smaller) fragments or to de-convolute the present spectra in order to obtain intensities of individual reflections. Work is in progress along this line.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>RESULTS and PROSPECTS 300 reflections could be collected and analyzed, A cell refinement w s achieved.
