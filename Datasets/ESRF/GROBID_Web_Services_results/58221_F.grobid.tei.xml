<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>DENV-3 is a part of the flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) located at the Cterminus of nonstructural protein NS5 of the Dengue virus. Collected multiple datasets (around 25) in the range of 1.8 -3.0 Å. These measurements were completed during the 5 th April and 13 th July visits. Currently, the manuscript is in preparation from these visits and respective PDBs will be submitted in the next few weeks.</p><p>FtsZ is a protein that assembles into a ring at the future site of the septum of bacterial cell division. It is a prokaryotic homologue to the eukaryotic protein tubulin. We will employ structure based drug design along with other biochemical methods to improve on the already available inhibitors of FtsZ. We have obtained native protein structure with datasets within a range of 1.8 -2.0 Å during the 11 th June visit that will now be used for further structure based drug discovery.</p></div>
