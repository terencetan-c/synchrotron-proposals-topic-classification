<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Report:</head><p>To investigate the residual stress in tungsten fibre-reinforced tungsten composites (Wf/W) produced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD-Wf/W) or a powder metallurgical process (PM-Wf/W) transmission diffraction maps were collected for various samples in the MA3147 experiment. Samples of the pure constituents W fibre, CVD W, PM W and various Wf/W samples with different interlayer materials mainly in the as fabricated but for some samples also in a heat treaded state have been investigated. Beside the residual stress in general, the difference between the two manufacturing routines have been of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Specimen preparation</head><p>Due to the strong absorption of W only thin samples can be used for the collection of transmission diffraction maps. For that reason, single fibre composite samples as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> were manufactured. These systems consist of a single W fibre possibly coated by an interlayer and embedded in a W matrix produced either by CVD or by PM. The interlayer was deposited on the fibres by a physical vapour deposition process. For CVD-Wf/W the matrix was produced by the reaction of WF6 and H2 at a temperature of 600°C for 6h. PM-Wf/W was produced by hot isostatic pressing for 4h at 2000 MPa at a temperature of 1500°C. After the production, the samples were electrolytically thinned and then cut to the needed height using a wire saw.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental</head><p>We used a highly energetic beam of 68 keV, with a wavelength of 0.18 Å and a beam size of ~20x20 µm² in a transmission diffraction set up. A FReLoN 2k camera (2048x2048 px) with an exposure time of 133ms for each image was used.</p><p>An example for the mounting of the CVD-Wf/W samples is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Several specimens were attached to a Kapton tape using a Cyanolit glue " to be able to perform multiple scans without changing the specimen holder.</p><p>For the PM-Wf/W, specimens with a 1µm, 2µm and 3µm thick the Er2O3 interlayer were measured. For the CVD-Wf/W, specimens with different interlayer materials (Er2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2,YSZ, TN, without interlayer) and interlayer thickness ranging from 10 -1000 nm were measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Result</head><p>We scanned 78 specimens and depending on the size of the specimen, up to 8000 single images per specimen were collected.</p><p>An example of a collected scan is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 a</ref>). Due to a lack of manpower data analysis is still ongoing.</p><p>As the first step the aszimuthal integration has been performed with an automated script for several specimens as shown for one sample in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 b</ref>). The analyses of the data will be done with python scripts by using pyFAI in the near future.
