<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Synchrotron powder diffraction at ID31 proved that Mg 2 C 60 shares the same structure of the superionic conductor Li 4 C 60 , with a peculiar hybrid 2D bonding network. Diffraction scans on heating evidenced also an extraordinary thermal stability up to 800 K, while Li 4 C 60 undergoes a polymer-to-monomer transition at 600 K (see report of the experiment CH-2715). The small Mg 2+ ions are expected to diffuse already at low temperature promoting even in this system an efficient superionic conductivity and this opens to applications in future Mg-ion batteries. Moreover, the well known ability of Mg to bind hydrogen makes this material also promising as a solid absorber of this gas.</p><p>In order to optimise the intercalation process and also to possibly extend the family of Mg intercalated fullerene compounds, recently we explored also different chemical routes.</p><p>In particular, we managed to intercalate C 60 with Mg via a "cold" reaction mediated by solvents, in which the alkali-earth metal can enter in solution, as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and methylamine. While the latter gave rise to amorphous compounds, stable crystalline samples were indeed produced by using THF. Here, the solvent itself took part to the reaction and was incorporated in the crystalline structure of the product, which resulted significantly expanded as compared with the host C 60 lattice.</p><p>In order to disentangle the structure of these new compounds, we performed high resolution synchrotron radiation powder diffraction at the beamline BM1B, both at room and at low temperature (down to 10 K), with monochromatic beam (λ = 0.5012(1) Å).</p><p>The samples were sealed in quartz capillaries of 0.5-1 mm diameter and mounted on the sticks of the helium cryostat. Technical problems found during the experiment with the apparatus for spinning the capillaries in the cryostat prevented us to properly average the effects induced by preferred orientations for some samples, and hence to obtain a reliable peak intensity in the diffractograms. However, one sample sealed in a bigger capillary of up to 1 mm diameter which also displayed a better powder homogeneity, as checked by preliminary laboratory XRD measurements on a Bruker D8 Discovery equipped with an area detector (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) allowed us to collect good quality data also at low temperature. The majority of the rather narrow peaks in the diffractogram collected on the Mg x C 60 (THF) y sample were indexed with the hexagonal cell: S. G. P6 3 /m m c, a = 15.240(1) Å, c = 9.882(1) Å, γ = 120° (see Le Bail analysis shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Some strong peaks at higher 2θ angle were easily attributed to a small fraction of unreacted Mg, while a fraction of very weak peaks could not be indexed and were ascribed to the presence of impurities. Preliminary structural analysis with the Simulated Annealing algorithm allowed us to identify a reliable starting model for the Rietveld refinement, which is however still in progress. In such structure, C 60 molecules are arranged in a hexagonal close packed lattice, while THF molecules are coordinated to Mg 2+ ions, forming columns with a three-fold symmetry (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). A rough estimation of the amount of unreacted Mg, compared with the nominal stoichiometry of 5 Mg atoms per C 60 introduced during the synthesis, allowed us to assume the formula MgC 60 (THF) 3 for this crystalline compound. The presence of pure Mg in this sample prevented us to thorough study the transport properties of this compound so far, but we expect that, due to the strong increase of the cell volume (the volume per C 60 molecule changes from ~710 Å 3 in pure C 60 to ~994 Å 3 ), the compound could have an insulating behaviour.</p><p>Thermal evolution of the lattice parameters on cooling the sample down to 10 K did not show the presence of any evident structural phase transition, while the estimated thermal expansion coefficients roughly resembles those of monomer phases of intercalated C 60 compounds (α a = 3.8⋅10 -5 K -1 , α c = 7.8⋅10 -5 K -1 ).

On the contrary, solid fullerene can host up to 5 Mg atoms per C 60 in the lattice interstices, where C 60 molecules polymerise to form a 2D rhombohedral structure with metallic character and unexpected thermal stability[2]. Recently, we also managed to isolate a new Mg fulleride Mg 2 C 60 , through a direct solid state reaction[3].</figDesc></figure>
