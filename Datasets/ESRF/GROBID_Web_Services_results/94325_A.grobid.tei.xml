			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the experiments were carried out with no users on site by Dr Thomas Zinn and Dr Narayanan Theyencheri. The samples were mounted in capillaries.</p><p>Due to changed laboratory arrangements caused by COVID-19 restrictions, the proposed samples were not run. Instead the self-assembly of a designed surfactant-like peptide was examined, using a combination of cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy and SAXS. It was to have remarkable pH-dependent selfassembly properties. Peptide Arg3-Leu12 (R3L12) forms a network of peptide nanotubes at pH 9 and below. These are associated with -helical conformation in a "cross-" nanotube structure, in which peptide dimers lie perpendicular to the nanotube axis, with arginine coated inner and outer nanotube walls. In contrast, this peptide forms decorated vesicular aggregates at higher pH values, close to the pKa of the arginine residues. These structures are associated with a loss of -helical order as detected through x-ray scattering, circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopy. The observation of the self-assembly of a simple surfactant-like peptide into these types of nanostructure is remarkable, and peptide R3L12 shows unique pH-dependent morphological and conformational behaviour, with the potential for a range of future applications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>SAXS curves measured at pH 9, 12 and 13 for 0.04 and R3L12 are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The SAXS data provide form factors which yield information on the self-assembled nanostructure in situ in solution. The data at pH 9 show well-defined oscillations, which result from interference scattering from the nanotube walls, and these features were fitted to a model of a hollow cylinder (long cylindrical shell) consistent with a nanotube structure (also revealed by cryo-TEM). The nanotube scattering oscillations are superposed on a background which is due to scattering from small clusters in the cryo-TEM images and/or unassociated peptides. The SAXS data for the samples at pH 12 and pH 13 show distinct features, with a power-law scattering at low q, which is due to the presence of fractal-like structures, also revealed by cryo-TEM and TEM. The SAXS data was measured out to high q, in order to probe possible peptide secondary structure. A peak corresponding to a spacing d = 11.2 Å is apparent in the data in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the peptide at pH 9 (and at d = 11.0 Å at pH 7). This is consistent with the expected diameter of a -helix. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> This peak is lost at higher pH, consistent with the loss of -helix secondary structure revealed in the CD spectra in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and also via FTIR spectra, to be discussed shortly.</p><p>Structural parameters obtained from the SAXS fitting for 0.04 wt% peptide solution at pH 9 provide a nanotube diameter equal to 2x[(5.3+3.7) ±2.8] = 18 ± 5.6 nm, which compares very well with 16.4±1.7 nm calculated from the average of the nanotube diameters from the cryo-TEM images. As previously discussed by us, the nanotube wall thickness corresponds closely to the length of R3L12 estimated using average residue spacings, 2 l = (0.15n)+(0.34p)= 2.82 nm (3 nm) where n = 12 (number of L residues in the -helix) and p= 3 (number of R residues). Our results are in agreement with a model for the nanotubes that have walls built from a single layer of -helical antiparallel peptide dimers. This work has been published. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
