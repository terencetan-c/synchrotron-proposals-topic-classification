<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Rab proteins are small GTP binding proteins involved in tethering and specific sorting between vescicles and membranes, allowing the vesicles to specifically address to the target membranes and fuse with them in order to release their cargo. Rab11 is implicated in the regulation of the trafficking events in the endocytic pathway at the recycling endosome. As all other small nucleotide binding proteins it cycles between an 'inactive' GDP-bound conformation and an 'active' GTP-bound form that can bind effectors proteins and thus trasmit a signal or trigger an event. Given the high number of Rab proteins in the cell (more than 40) understanding the structural mechanism by which each Rab protein is specifically associated to a given pathway, in which it plays a key role, remains a major issue. To elucidate the mechanisms by which this subtle regulation is accomplished we overtook the structural study of a protein (Rab3IP) that has been shown to interact with Rab11 and is supposed to be a nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), that is a protein that catalyses the release of GDP form the protein and permits thus its activation. Crystals of a fragment of Rab3IP have been obtained and tested for diffraction on ID29 on February 11 th , 2002. The crystals diffracted up to 9 Å in the best of the case and a diffraction pattern of a fiber-like structure was always present. We are currently working on enhancing the crystal quality, namely working on different crystallisation conditions.</p><p>Benoit Gigant, Thierry Bizebard (1.7 shifts): Structural strudy of the stathmintubulin complex During this visit, a data set was collected at two wavelengths (peak and inflection point) with a platinum derivative, using a crystal that diffracts to 4.0 Å. The crystal suffered very much from radiation damage (scale factor varying from 1 to 0.25 in scalepack) and, probably as a consequence, the data quality is not very good (Rsym overall : 0.11; Rsym in the 4.15 Å -4.0 Å shell: 0.53). Although platinum sites have previously been identified in this derivative, the heavy atoms could not be located using the two data sets we collected during this visit. Radiation decay is a major problem as it has always been with these crystals. Apparently the attenuators we introduced did not compensate for the additional brilliance of the beam on ID29 since the vacuum ondulator has been installed. Data collected in previous visits, during the first half of this BAG and the one that precedes it <ref type="bibr">(LS 1928</ref>) have now been fully analysed. There are two major results :</p><p>-a SAD data set collected on ID14-4 at the Se peak wavelength has allowed us to locate four peaks in an anomalous difference map (in a complex that comprises ca 2000 amino acids); their spacing coresponds to that of the four methionine residues of stathmin. Three of the methionines are located in the stathmin long helix that connects the two tubulin molecules of the complex. Their identification allows us to orient this stathmin helix in the complex, which had not been possible before from the molecular replacement phases.</p><p>The fourth methionine is the third stathmin residue (counting from the Nterm) and is located close to helix H10 of a tubulin α subunit. This confirms results obtained by others using a cross-linking reagent and is a direct experimental indication of the location of the N-term domain of stathmin in the complex.</p><p>Unfortunately, the phases deduced from these data are not of sufficient quality to calculate an experimental map. 1) two derivatives have been identified, one with Yb, the other with Platinum, both in SAD experiments. They have allowed us to calculate experimental phases to 5.5 Å (with a figure of merit larger than 0.2, before any solvent flattening; figure of merit at 6.5Å: 0.4). More data should now be collected on these derivatives to extend the resolution of experimental phases to the highest resolution possible. It should in particular be possible now to exploit the length of our crystals (more than .3 mm in most cases) to collect MAD data sets in wedges at different points, as has been demonstrated successfully with ribosome crystals. Se Met 115 Se Met 101 Se Met 92 Se Met 3 Sonia Fieulaine, Sylvie Nessler (0.9 shift) : structural study of HPr Kinase/Phosphorylase (HprK/P)</p><p>HPr-kinase/phosphorylase is a bacterial Ser/Thr kinase which has no sequence similarities with other known protein kinases. Sugars enter the cell via the PTS system, then glycolysis produces FBP which activates phosphorylation of the small protein HPr on residue Ser-46, catalysed by HPr-kinase. Further interaction of P-Ser-HPr with the transcription regulator CcpA activates the carbon catabolite repression signalisation pathway. The aim of this study is to understand the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme HPrkinase/phosphorylase.</p><p>In year 2000, a first native data set had been collected on ID14-1 of 24/02/00 to 2.8Å resolution with crystals of the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P. A MAD data set collected on ID14-4 of 22/09/00 using the selenomethionine modified form of the protein allowed us to solve the first structure of HprK/P.</p><p>Fieulaine et al.
