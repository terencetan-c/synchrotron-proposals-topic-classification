<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of our experiment is to study the angular momentum coupling of the two-particle states involved in the decay processes of excited corehole states in 3d-transition metals and in the rarcwarth metals inter alia. To this purpose the spin-spin correlation behveen oriented hole states excited by circularly polar&amp;xl radiation and electrons emitted by autoionization and Auger-decay processes is probed. In our apparatus the circularly polarised radiation passes the 90" spherical electron spectrometer and hits the target at normal incidence. Electrons emitted inside a cone of about f 1' around the surface normal are decelerated, energy analysed by the spectrometer and imaged into the retarding spherical Mott-polarimeter for spin polarization analysis. Bearing in mind the problems with the spectrometer power supplies during our beamtime in April 1996, we firstly investigated the L,W Auger process in Cu. For exciting the L, hole-states we used radiation with energy of 937eV i 4.5eV (insert in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The spin resolved data are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>  the 'G, peak and the 'S, peak are preferentially built up by I+, i.e. by electrons with spin parallel to the photon spin, the preferred spin orientation is inverted for the 'F, 3 peak, the preferred spin orientatmn found here in the l&amp;d line is contrary to the one we found with the WW Auger process [3] using Cu(100) instead of Cu(l11). On the basis of our present data we cannot decide whether the preferred spin orientation found to be different here is due to the changed crystal orientation or due to p + d primary excitations possible near to E, <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Due to the energy width of 9eV we expect primary excitations from 2p-states to 4s-derived states to dominate in our present experiment. It is worth noting that the preferred spin orientation found in the L,W Auger peak at CuO atIer 2p + 3d excitation by circularly polar&amp;d radiation <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> is identical to the one revealed here. All in all, our results agree with the atomic model of the L,W Auger process in Cu. Especially at the low energy side of the 'G4 line no significant line shape differences for I+and I-are present, which contradicts our results for the NW process on Cu(lO0) <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>With the measurements on Cu(ll1) the counting rate was so5ciently bigb (approx. 50 cps at peak maximum, spectrometer resolution AE c 1eV). With the Gd films grow onto W(110) at the 3d + 4f resonance the intensity was found to lie just at the lower limit acceptable for measurements (10 cps at peak maximum, channelplate background 4 cps, pass energy 140eV resulting in AE = 1.4ev). Studying emission processes out of the 3d + 4f resonance has proven not to be practicable without enlarging the angular acceptance of our spectrometer and improving the Mott-polarimeter. Our results measured at the Gd 3d + 4f resonance using the photon energy 1184.4eV f 1.3eV is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The emitted electrons show a preferred spin orientation parallel to the photon spin. This is identical to that which (due to the relativistic dipole selection roles) the electrons resonantly excited from 3d to 4f states should have. Therefore the emission process is clearly identified to be an autoionization process <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> and the electrons filling up the Jd-holes should have a preferred spin orientation antiparallel to the one of the resonantly excited electrons. The important role of spin-orbit coupling inside the core states is evident.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>by partial intensities I+ and I-representing electrons totally spin polar&amp;d parallel and antiparallel to the photon spin, respectively.
