<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of this beamtime was to investigate a novel technical catalyst with spectralptychography. This technique is not yet well established at the ID16B beamline, but the feasibility has been shown in the former beamtime <ref type="bibr">(MI-1346)</ref>. This beam time served both to further develop the method on the beamline and to use the knowledge already gained from the feasibility study to obtain valuable information about the catalysts under investigation.  The first two shifts were used to prepare the beamline for the experiments. The preparation included the installation of a vacuum flytube to avoid the absorption of the scattered radiation in the air between the sample and the detector, which has to be as far away as possible for the proper sampling of the Fourier space.</p><p>As a detector, we used a maxipix with a pixel size of 55x55 µm², which had to be installed at the correct height. For the energy calibration, we performed scans of a Mn foil. The flux had to be adjusted to ensure the linearity of the detector. To make sure that the detector pixels and the scanning direction of the sample stage are parallel, the first scans were performed with an InGaN nanofiber sample.</p><p>The following shifts were used for the resonant ptychography experiment. For each sample, test scans were performed to find the best scan parameters, that is, the scan region, the number of scan points, the step size and the acquisition time per scan point. The number of scan points per sample was around 900, the step size between 1 µm and 1.3 µm, and the counting time around 1 ms. The pixelsize in the reconstructed phase images is around 35 nm. One ptychographic scan at one energy took around 15 minutes, and hence the pure measurement time for one sample was around 10 hours (without alignment and test scans).</p><p>We could successfully reconstruct the phase images of the three catalyst samples for almost all energies. At some energies, we had problems that could be related to instabilities of the beam and a loss of coherence, which could be observed especially directly after injections. We could also observe changes in the resin around the samples. Nevertheless, for the first time, the microstructure of an FCC catalyst particle is revealed by ptychography at the beamline ID16B. The experiments and first results have already been presented in an oral presentation at the IUCr congress 2021. We also plan to publish the results.</p><p>The spectral analysis of the data turns out to be difficult due to several reasons, including the instabilities of the beam, but also the very thin sample with a low concentration of Mn. Data analysis is still in progress. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The studies include 2D spectral-ptychographic scans and complementary low-resolution X-ray fluorescence scans of the samples. The chosen samples are 150-nm thin slices of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) particles deposited in Si3N4 membranes. Three different particles in different states (fresh, spent, and regenerated) were investigated. The samples are composed of zeolites, an alumina binder, kaolin clay, SiC, and a metal-oxide additive, in this case, Mn2O3. The goal was to localize the Mn in the catalyst and determine the oxidation state of the active metal site. Therefore, the ptychographic scans were repeated at 40 different energies around the Mn K-edge (6539 eV) including the resonant (edge) energy.</figDesc></figure>
