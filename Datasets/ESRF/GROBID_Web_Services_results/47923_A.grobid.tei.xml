<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>The weathering of silicate glasses is caused by a series of physico-chemical transformations in presence of water <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the most important one being the leaching-out of mobile cations such as Na + , K + and Ca 2+ . This can result in the formation of lamellar structures in the glass making the glass opaque, but the glass can also change colour due to introduction of chromophoric metal ions from the environment or alteration of already present metal ions. First, molecular water penetrates into the glass weakening the silicate network by hydration and reverse hydrolysis reactions.</p><p>≡Si-O-Si≡ + H 2 O (aq) → 2 ≡Si-OH 2 ≡Si-OH → ≡Si-O-Si≡ + H 2 O (glass) In a second step the most mobile cations from the glass will be leached out into the solution and are replaced by protons <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> from this solution. The mobility of the cations depends on charge, size and glass composition. As a result, some glass compositions (e.g. silica-rich glasses) are more resistant to leaching then others. The ions removed from the glass structure can also form weathering products (e.g. sulphates, chlorides, etc.) on the glass surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> ≡Si</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">-O -M + (glass) + H + (aq) → ≡Si-O -H + (glass) + M + (aq)</formula><p>If the water that is in contact with the glass is not (regularly) replenished, the pH of the aqueous solution will increase, due to the cation/proton exchange, which results in a further degradation of the silicate network by hydroxyl ions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">≡Si-O-Si ≡ + OH - (aq) → ≡Si-OH + ≡Si-O - ≡Si-O -+ H 2 O (aq) → ≡Si-OH + OH - (aq)</formula><p>These weathering processes cause the formation of a gellayer with a lower density than the original glass. The thickness of the gelllayer will gradually increase and the stress across the interface of the healthy and altered glass will cause thin layers of altered glass to crack off, exposing new surfaces of fresh glass to the weathering agents. Trace elements such as Mn, present in the natural environment (e.g. in the soil in which the glass was buried) can intrude in the leached layer and colour it. <ref type="bibr">[4-5-6-7]</ref> The aim of this experiment was to simulate natural weathering by artificially altering non-durable sensor glass (Fraunhofer sensor glass M1.0), which in a later stage can be used to evaluate treatment methods for naturally weathered historical glass. In order to simulate/accelerate the leaching of cations from the glass into the solution glass samples were placed in a HCl-solution (pH=0) during several hours. Secondly the glass fragments were placed in a 0.05M MnCl 2 -solution, making Mn-intrusion from the solution into the leached layer possible. In a last stap a 1% v/v hydrogen peroxide solution was used in an attempt to oxidize the Mn 2+ to water insoluble MnO 2 , mimicking the Mn inclusions that can be found inside leached layers of natural weathered historical glass. The glass fragments were characterized after each stage of the artifical weathering. High resolution µ-XRF maps were recorded to characterize and visualize the leaching/introduction of relevant elements (Si, Cl, K, Ca, Mn), while µ-XANES was used to determine the oxidation state (speciation) of the Mn present in the leached layer. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement/data:</head><p>A flux of 10 9 ph/s using Fresnel zone plate focussing optics was available. Previous experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> showed photo-reduction of Mn-inclusions after an irradiation time of 120 s (with a similar set-up), the zone plate was slightly defocussed during the XANES point measurements resulting in a 5 by 5 microns spot-size to avoid this effect. A 2 micron step size and a 500 ms dwell time were used for the X-ray maps as a good balance between the necessary resolution needed to visualize the formed leached layer (and Mn-intrusion) and the time needed to record the X-ray maps. Since the measuring time for each individual pixel was only 500 ms, photo-reduction was avoided during the acquisition time of the maps. A Silicon Drift Detector was used for the µ-XANES point measurements and the µ-XRF mapping. Several Mn-reference spectra were recorded with 100 µm beam and photodiode detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Status and progress of evaluation:</head><p>For both the XRF mapping and the XANES measurements the PyMCA software package was used for the fittting of the XRF spectra , as is visualised in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. For the XANES measurement a point of interest is scanned with a Xray beam varying in energy and for each energy a XRF spectrum (b: spectrum with excitation energy +/-6.56 eV) is recorded. After fitting these spectra the intensities of the Mn-K lines are given as a function of the excitation energy resulting in a XANES spectrum (e).</p><p>Several points were measured on each sample, distributed over the entire leached layer. The XANES spectra were then fitted with measured reference compounds, by means of linear combination fitting using the ATHENA software package. The reference compounds included several Mn-oxides and minerals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The different weathering conditions that have been analyzed, are summarized in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>  The elemental distribution maps (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) could be used to determine the leaching depth (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) of each cation since it is possible to look at the intensity profile of elements alongside a line perpendicular to the surface (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The experiment pointed out that the leaching depth is +/-equal for K and Ca, but that K is leached out completely while Ca remains partially in the leached layer, this in good agreement with the mobility difference between K + and Ca 2+ . The thickness of the leached layer reaches a maximum of +/-58 µm after 6 h in 1M HCl (red line figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> (f)). Furthermore the line profiles proof that Mn has indeed penetrated the leached layer, since Mn is found together with Si. µ-XANES could then be used to determine the speciation of Mn on different locations inside and on top of the leached layer. In every sample measured the most dominant speciation was proven to be the mineral hausmannite (Mn 2+ Mn 3+ 2 O 4 ) (figure 2 (e)), even before emerging the sample in H 2 O 2 -solution. shows the intensity (a.u.) of K-K, Ca-K, Mn-K and Si-K line in function of the depth, the thickness of the Si-enriched layer is used as a reference for the leaching depth in (f). and blue line: standard reduction potential Mn 3 O 4 /Mn 2+ [10].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion and future</head><p>This experiment was a first attempt to create artificially weathered glass in order to use it in a later stage as reference weathered glass to evaluate glass treatment methods. The intrusion of Mn from the MnCl 2 -solution was proven, however hausmannite precipitated at neutral ph (MnCl 2 -solution), while naturally weathered historical glass often shows MnO 2 inclusions giving it a typical black colour. Thermodynamical analysis of a Mn-O-H system (figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) points out that at aplied conditions MnO 2 should be more stable than hausmannite. Meaning that hausmannite formation is kinetically favoured and further oxidation to MnO 2 , being a solid state reaction, is most likely to be very slow. In order to avoid this problem for future experiments glass fragments will be emerged in a MnCl 2 solution buffered at pH +/-4, in this pH region MnO 2 still is the most stable Mn-compound while haussmanite should not be formed (figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Different stages in the artificial weathtering of the Fraunhofer M1.0 sensor glass.
