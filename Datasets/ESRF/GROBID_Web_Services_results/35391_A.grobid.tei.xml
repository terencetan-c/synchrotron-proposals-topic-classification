			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to study the influence of chemical composition on the zeolite precursors several clear solutions were prepared and measured with SAXS. The amount of the structure directing agent, tetrapropylammonium-hydroxide, was varied in 20 sample. The water amount was altered in 10 clear solutions as was the ethanol contents in 4 solutions. The scattering patterns were recorded at room temperature with a gas-filled detector, at a distance of 1.50 m from the sample. The accumulation time per SAXS pattern was 60 s. The intensity I as a function of scattering vector (q) was obtained by radially averaging the 2D patterns, after applying the corrections for transmission and empty cell background. The qaxis was calibrated using Ag Behenate crystals. The results of altering the amount of TPAOH were used in a paper recently published by Chem. Mat.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BM26B</head><p>Date of experiment:</p><p>from: 18-SEP-06 to: 22-SEP-06</p><p>Date of report:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7-sep-07</head><p>Shifts:</p><p>dynamics of the suspensions revealed the occurrence of two diffusive processes. The faster process is a collective particle diffusion. The slower process corresponds to the particle selfdiffusion and is present because of the presence of polydispersity in size, shape, and/or surface charge. The self-diffusion coefficient provides a means to estimate the equivalent hydrodynamic radius. The observations hence reveal a complex, polydisperse mixture of particles present at the onset of the Silicalite-1 zeolite formation. Implications on the proposed zeolite formation mechanisms are briefly discussed. An other paper containing the results of the alteration of the water amount is in preparation for publishing in Micropoporous and Mesoporous Materials.</p><p>Reference: Follens L.R.A., Aerts A., Haouas M., Caremans T.P., Loppinet B., Goderis B., Vermant J., Kirschhock C.E.A., Taulelle F., Martens J.A., Influence of water on clear solution suspensions for the synthesis of Silicalite-1 studied with NMR, SAXS and DLS, in preparation.</p><p>Next to these studies on static samples, a dynamic study was done on the influence in a change of the template contents at different stages of the crystallization. Clear solutions quenched after different heating times were diluted with TPAOH and followed in time with SAXS at room temperature. The results of this study will be descibed in a paper.</p><p>The crystallization process of a clear solution was also followed in-situ during heating in a sealed cell. For this work a regular clear solution was heated at 95Â°C during 5h. Every minute a SAXS measurement was performed. Since 29 Si NMR measurements cannot be performed at high temperature, measurements with this diagnostic are performed at room temperature on quenched samples. To verify if these quenched samples can be compared to in-situ measurements, several quenched samples were prepared from the same clear solution and measured in capillary mode at room temperature. It was found that the quenched samples show the same SAXS pattern as the heated sample after similar heating time. The results of the in-situ study has been written in a paper and shall be submitted to ChemPhysChem.

In our original proposal we asked to use a combined SAXS/WAXS setup on our samples so we could also detect the first Bragg reflections. Unfortunately the WAXS detector was broken on our arrival so only SAXS measurements could be performed. We are still hoping to perform these WAXS measurements in a future synchrotron session, as study other alterations and crystallization in systems with other chemical composition.</p></div>		</body>
