<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The α-1-antitrypsin (or alpha-1-antitrypsin, A1AT) Z variant is the primary cause of severe A1AT deficiency and forms polymeric chains that aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Around 2%-5% of Europeans are heterozygous for the Z and WT M allele, and there is evidence of increased risk of liver disease when compared with MM A1AT individuals. We have shown that Z and M A1AT can copolymerize in cell models, but there has been no direct observation of heteropolymer formation in vivo. To this end, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb2H2) that specifically binds to M in preference to Z A1AT, localized its epitope using crystallography to a region perturbed by the Z (Glu342Lys) substitution, and used Fab fragments to label polymers isolated from an MZ heterozygote liver explant. Glu342 is critical to the affinity of mAb2H2, since it also recognized the mild S-deficiency variant (Glu264Val) present in circulating polymers from SZ heterozygotes. Negative-stain electron microscopy of the Fab2H2-labeled liver polymers revealed that M comprises around 6% of the polymer subunits in the MZ liver sample. These data demonstrate that Z A1AT can form heteropolymers with polymerization-inert variants in vivo with implications for liver disease in heterozygous individuals. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Kozielski group</head><p>Arry-520 is an advanced drug candidate from the Eg5 inhibitor class undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Here we show by structural analysis that Arry-520 binds stoichiometrically to the motor domain of Eg5 in the conventional allosteric loop L5 pocket in a complex that suggests the same structural mechanism as other Eg5 inhibitors. We have previously shown that acquired resistance through mutations in the allosteric binding site located at loop L5 in the Eg5 structure appears to be independent of the inhibitors' scaffold, which suggests that Arry-520 will ultimately have the same fate. When Arry-520 was assessed in two cell lines selected for the expression of either Eg5(D130A) or Eg5(L214A) STLC-resistant alleles, mutations previously shown to convey resistance to this class of inhibitors, it was inactive in both. Surprisingly, when the cells were challenged with ispinesib, another Eg5 inhibitor that has been evaluated in clinical trials, the Eg5(D130A) cells were resistant, but those expressing Eg5(L214A) were strikingly sensitive. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that subtle differences in ligand binding may alter allosteric transmission from the loop L5 site that do not necessarily result in reduced inhibitory activity in mutated Eg5 structures. Whilst we predict that cells challenged with Arry-520 in the clinical setting are likely to acquire resistance through point mutations in the Eg5 binding site, the data for ispinesib suggests that this resistance mechanism is not scaffold independent as previously thought, and new inhibitors can be designed that retain inhibitory activity in these resistant cells.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary Report from individual groups</head><p>The Waksman group was working on a Legionella pneumophila DotB homologue, which was screened on ID23 on the 6/3/2017. Even though no improvement of resolution was observed, the session was essential to improve the crystallisation conditions at a later stage. This work resulted a publication in Protein Science (doi: 10.1002/pro.3439) The Wallace group was examining the transcriptional regulation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They screened 12 crystals on ID23 and 4 datasets were collected ranging in resolution from 3.15 Å to 5.44 Å but none of them resulted a publishable structure. On a second visit in April 2018 the aim was to test crystals of the transmembrane pore of a sodium channel. Unfortunately, there were problems with the beamline that made impossible to collect any data. The Barrett group attempted to collect crystals of Tip69 on Id23-2 (11/6/2018). While some of the crystals that were tested didn't diffract sufficiently, there was in addition a sample changer problem that resulted a significant loss of beam time. On a second visit all the Tip49telomeric DNA crystals diffracted to very low resolution where only test shots could be obtained. The Kozielski group solved two structures of human Eg5 in complex with K858. This structure provided a platform for structure-based drug design and was essential for rational design of inhibitor analogues. In addition, they developed a screen for the crystallisation of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and confirmed its usefulness by solving two RdRp-inhibitor complexes of dengue virus RdRp. Several human MCAK structures in various nucleotide states have been solved and the structures are being prepared for submission and a manuscript in preparation. They also collected data on a large variety of crystals of M. tuberculosis FtsZ and DENV RdRp in complex with fragments. These structures will reveal novel inhibitors binding sites and will allow structure-based drug design (in progress). These complex structures will serve as a basis to develop inhibitors with higher potency and efficacy. For example, data collected from the Massif beamtime for Dengue RdRp in complex with fragments (about 200 data sets) has been processed by standard methods but without any success, but the same data has been processed using the PanDDA software from DLS and a range of fragments binding to DENV RdRp has been identifed. The Irving group have been characterising mutants of the disease-associated plasma protein alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and conformationally-selective antibodies that act as probes of structural change. They have also expended effort attempting to obtain high resolution structures of AAT bound to small molecules, which has necessitated screening of a significant number of crystals. Structures of mutants with substitutions that modify packing in the 'breach' regulatory site of AAT have been solved, as have structures of Fab domains both alone and in complex with AAT. The latter have been used to interpret single-particle reconstructions from negative stain images of oligomers isolated from patients and decorated with Fabs; these data are being written up into two manuscripts which will be submitted in due course. One of the Fab complexes is with an antibody that is being used to screen patient plasma and will represent a third paper.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (A) Central panel: the A1AT-Fab2H2 complex (PDB accession 6I3Z) is shown, with the Fab heavy chain colored blue; the light chain colored green; β-sheets A, B, and C colored red, salmon, and yellow, respectively; and the site of the Z mutation indicated by a red ellipse.

The complex has yet to be structurally characterised to a high resolution through crystallography or electron microscopy. SAXS data obtained at ESRF, has enabled us to confirm the oligomeric state of the complex, as well as a proposed highly extended conformation. We will use this data in parallel with native mass spectrometry data to better understand the structure of the complex which may lead to functional insights Barrett group: During this trip, SAXS data were successfully collected on complexes involving vFLIP (native and several mutants) and IKK. This trip was very successful resulting in full datasets being obtained for all samples in both batch and HPLC data collection modes. The data is currently being analysed.</p></div>			</div>
