<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This report is being written less than 1 week after the end of the experiment in order to comply with the formal requirement that a report is filed before a subsequent application is made. Clearly it is tentative and brief since the data have not yet been fully analysed. This experiment differed from the two magnetic Compton scattering investigations that we carried out in 1995 in using a new rotatable permanent magnet provided by Warwick university. This magnet has two advantages over the electromagnets normally used. First the field is higher (l Tesla at the centre of a 42mm gap) and second higher angles of scattering can be achieved because there is no magnet structure in the plane of scattering. This latter point results in better resolution. Thus by using a germanium semiconductor detector with low electronic noise, an incident energy of 92 keV and a scattering angle of 170Â°, it was possible to achieve a resolution at the Compton peak of 0.48 au which compares very favorably with the values of 0.70 -0.80 au recorded in similar experiments at KEK Japan. The only aspect of the ESRF experiment that is inferior to its Japanese predecessor is the count rate capability.</p><p>A detector with a single head means 30,000 cps maximum (for linear response) compared with</p></div>		</body>
