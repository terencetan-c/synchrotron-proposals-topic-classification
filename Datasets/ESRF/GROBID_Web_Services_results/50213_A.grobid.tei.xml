<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective and expected results</head><p>The legume plant Anthyllis vulneraria has been revealed as a pionner plant to revegetalize mining sites, and the aim of our project is to understand the mechanisms developped by the plant to cope with Zn and Cd toxicity in a context of phytostabilization. The aim of our experiment was to determine the mechanisms developped by the symbiotic association Anthyllis vulneraria -Mezorhizobium metallidurans to tolerate Cd and specially to clarify the role of rhizobium in the storage of metals. Recently, we have found that the inoculation of A. vulneraria with metallicolous (MET) and nonmetallicolous (N-MET) rhizobium strains decreased the metal concentration in leaves compared to the noninoculated plant. The aim of this proposal was to specify if the storage of Cd in the rhizobium nodules varied depending on the rhizobium strain and if this rhizobium strain impacted the distribution of Cd in nodules and plant organs, as well as the mechanisms of Cd binding. For that purpose, we used a combination of chemical mapping using X-ray Fluorescence (µXRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (XANES and µXANES) using Cd L III -edge. During this experiment, we investigated roots and nodules of A. vulneraria grown in various conditions of bacterial inoculation (metallicolous (MET) ou non-metallicolous (N-MET) strains).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and and the conclusions of the study</head><p>Anthyllis vulneraria were grown in hydroponics with 10 µM Cd during 4 weeks. Nodules and roots were collected and prepared as thin-sections using a cryo-microtome. Cd distribution was studied by µXRF at 3.57 KeV, K and Ca distribution at 4.1 KeV and chemical ligands were determined by Cd LIII-edge µXANES recorded on points of interest. The beam size on the sample was 0.6 µm (H) x 0.2 µm (V). Measurements were performed at -170°C using a cryostat. µXRF data were treated using PYMCA software and µXANES spectra using Athena software. The µXANES spectra were then compared to spectra of model-compounds and fitted by linear combinations of these reference spectra.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In nodules from MET strain, Cd is mainly in the interior of nodules, more precisely in cells infected with bacteria (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Infected cells are known to be N-fixing cells. Cd distribution was also determined in nodules from N-MET strain. There was no significant difference of Cd distribution in nodules between MET and N-MET inoculated plant. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the XANES spectra recorded on nodule samples and on two Cd references: Cd-malate, as a representative of Cd-COOH/OH group with Cd-O/N bonds, and Cd-cysteine as a representative of Cd-thiols composed of Cd-S bonds. On Cd-malate spectrum, the first peak is typical of Cd-O ligands. This peak was observed on bulk nodule spectra. Bulk analyses showed that Cd was mainly bound to O ligands in nodules and there was no significant difference between Cd speciation in nodules between MET and N-MET inoculated plant (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). However, some micro-analyses performed on the most Cd-enriched areas of nodules showed that Cd was mainly bound to S ligand (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), suggesting that the Cd chemical species are multiple in nodules. To our knowledge, it's the first study that reports metal distribution and speciation in symbiotic legumes, but bulk results should be confirmed by EXAFS. 3530 3540 3550 3560 3570 3580 Energy (eV) Normalized Absorption Cd-phosphate à O ligand Cd-cystein à S ligand Nod-N-MET -Bulk Nod-MET -Bulk Root-MET -Bulk Cd-malate à O ligand Root-MET -Vascular bundles Nod-MET -Cd-enriched area 0 20 40 60 80 100 Cd-O Cd-S % de ligands Cd-S ligand Cd-O ou Cd-N ligand Cd L III -edge Eneregy (eV) Normalized absorption Figure 2 : Cd L III -edge XANES spectra collected on bulk nodules from A. vulneraria inoculated by rhizobium with MET N-MET strains grown on 10 µM Cd and Cd L III -edge µXANES spectra collected in Cd-enriched area of nodules and of vascular system of root, compared to Cd references : Cd-malate as representative of Cd-COOH/OH group with Cd-O/N bonds and Cd-cysteine as representative of Cd-thiols composed of Cd-S ligands. Each spectrum (colored lines) is shown with its linear combination fit (black lines). Distribution of Cd species are presented for the samples after normalization of the percentages to 100%. The uncertainty is estimated to ±10%. In roots of MET inoculated plant, Cd is mainly in cortex, bundles and more concentrated in the endodermis (Figure 3). Cd distribution was investigated in several roots of N-MET inoculated plant and there was no significant difference of Cd distribution. In Cd-enriched areas of endodermis and vascular bundles, Cd was mainly bound to S ligands. The same observation was done by Salt et al. (1995) in roots of Brassica Juncea and they suggested that Cd could be transported as Cd-S ligand. It could be the same case in A. vulneraria. 222 µm S P Mg Cd 580 µm Ca K 282 µm 551 µm epidermis cortex xylem phloem endodermis max min Figure 2: Elemental maps recorded by µXRF for Cd, P, S, K and Ca of a cross-section nodule of A. vulneraria inoculated with MET strain grown on 10µM Cd.
