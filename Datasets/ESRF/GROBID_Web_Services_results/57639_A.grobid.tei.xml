These elements are known to exist in measurable, albeit trace, amounts in the retina and play key roles in retinal physiology and disease. The aim of the experiment that took place on ID16-B was to explore the presence of high iron deposits in the retinas of young (3 weeks) and old (18 months) mice. The retinas were in the form of thin sections deposited on SiN windows. Up to 4 sections per group were studied at three resolution levels, 50 nm , 300 nm and 1µm (off the focal plane). The energy of 17.5 keV was used therefore we could capture the fluoerescence of a multitude of elemenents in a single map. Sections were screened first at a coarse step of 1 um to determine boundaries of different anatomical zones and to localise areas of high iron deposits. These were then scanned at intermediate and at high resolution in order to investigate the shape of the structures. The sensitivity of the instrument allowed relatively high speed scanning (100-400 msec dwell time) with good response from P to Br. Two reference materials (thin metal film from Axo and bovine liver from NIST) were measured to quantify the levels of the essential trace elements in the samples.</p><p>As one of the main aims of the study was to explore changes in the levels of predominately Fe, but also Cu and Zn, in the ageing animals, the maps were normalised for variations in the photon flux before extracting quantitative information. Pymca was used for peak fitting and quantification. The resulting concentration maps were converted into tiffs for statistical processing in ImageJ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The two kinds of information we are trying to obtain are, what is the nature of the iron deposits and do they present differently in aged in comparison to young animals. In trying to elucudate their nature we are looking into size, shape, location and association with other elements.</p><p>In the example of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> the round iron structure of approximately 1 µm diameter is devoid of any ather elements.</p><p>The iron-bearing structures we found vary in shape and localisation and their sizes range from &lt;0.5 µm up to several microns. The concentration of the iron overal in the retina is the order of 20-200 ppm but the maxium values in the hot spots range from the hundreds up to a couple of thousand ppm.</p><p>To extract representative concentrations, regions of interest are drawn in the different parts of the tissue and average concentration values are calculated. For the high iron deposits threshold analysis is used and the concentrations of the different elements in the hot spots are extracted.</p><p>The high iron deposits were seen in most sections. However the maximum levels of iron were increased in the aged animals in relation to the young. In previous micro-beam investigations in primate retinas we had found a much higher degree of incidence in the aged animals; confirming this finding in this experiment is not as straightfoward as the substantially smaller beam does not permit investigation of large areas for statistically representative regions.</p><p>There is a wealth of information in the 30-odd maps produced which we plan to complement with histochemical staining. We are now in the process of writing a manuscipt to be submitted to a relevant journal in the next few months.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Fig. 1: Iron -loaded structure in mouse retina.
