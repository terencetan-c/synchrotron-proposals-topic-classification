<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Titanates (ATiO3), a class of perovskite compounds attracting much fundamental and applied science, distort from the parent cubic structure (s.g. Pm-3m) decreasing their symmetry due to different phonon instabilities. Many of these transitions are influenced by steric effects, generally expressed by the tolerance factor (Goldschmidt) t=(rA+rO)/√2(rB+rO), where rA, rB and rO are the ionic radii of cations in the A, B and oxygen sites, respectively. For small A cations t&lt;1; the system tends to have strong antiferrodistortive (AFD) octahedral-tilting instabilities such as in CaTiO3 (CTO, t=0.946) causing the symmetry lowering to the centrosymmetric I4/mcm space group at 1635 K. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Conversely, zone-center ferroelectric (FE) modes should be stronger in perovskites with t&gt;1. BaTiO3 (BTO, t=1.063), a typical example of the emergence of spontaneous electric polarization, undergoes a series of phase transitions on cooling (Pm-3m  P4mm  Amm2  R3m) related to zone-center polar instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , involving the FE displacement of Ti. SrTiO3 (STO, t=1.002), is unstable to both FE (Γ-point) and AFD (R-point) phonons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> It is well known, however, that quantum fluctuations prevent condensation of the FE mode down to zero temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . Thus, the STO phase diagram was interpreted in terms of competition between the polar and the antiferrodistorsive instabilities [5]   , whereby the FE instability should be progressively suppressed by a stronger octahedral-tilting instability. The interplay between STO structure and FE instability has been recently reexamined <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> : by computing the energy gain due to FE as a function of octahedral tilt angle (ϕ), it was found that the TiO6 rotation indeed dampens the FE mode, but only for small ϕ angles. Larger ϕ angles (&gt;6°) combined with increased tetragonality do in fact enhance the FE distortion in order to recover the loss of Ti-O π bonding along the c axis We confirmed this assumption experimentally by investigating the structure of Pr-doped Sr1-xPrxTiO3 (SPTO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . By substituting Sr 2+ with the smaller Pr 3+ ion we lowered the SrTiO3 tolerance factor, boosting both the tilting angle and the AFD transition temperature; but at the same time FE structural responses were switched on, such as hard polar Raman modes and a polarization-induced electrostrictive strain. In addition, our PDF analysis evidenced local AFD distortions much larger than in the long-range AFD structure and locally non-zero ϕ values even within average cubic phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , in agreement with the DFT results in Ref. [5]. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the cooperation/competition of FE and AFD instabilities in STO based solid solutions with t&gt;1 This was done doping SrTiO3 with small concentrations of Ba (≤ 35%). Forming Sr1-xBaxTiO3 (SBTO) solid solutions and investigating the structure at temperatures between 10 and 300 K We measured accurately the structure of SBTO as a function of both temperature and composition, by means of high resolution powder diffraction measurements coupled with the real-space Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>Samples of Sr1-xBaxTiO3 (x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35) were prepared by using solid state synthesis. Stoichiometric mixtures of SrCO3 (Aldrich, 99.9%), BaCO3 (99.9%), TiO2 (99.9%) were mixed and underwent firing cycles at1000 °C, 1200 °C, 1200 °C, 1400°C with intermediate grindings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection strategy</head><p>XRPD data were collected at the ID22 beamline selecting an X-ray wavelength of λ = 0.399946 Å and using a 9-elements detector array (high resolution setup). Powdered samples of SBTO were put in 0.3 mm capillaries and cooled down to 10 K in a He-cryostat; data were collected up to 100 K. Measurements between 90 and 300 K were carried out using the cryostream of ID22. Rietveld quality XRPD patterns were collected up to Qmax≈12 Å -1 at 12, 25, 40, 60, 80, 90, 100, 120, 150, 200, 250, 300 K. Measurements at 90 and 100 K were collected twice, using both the crysostream and the cryostat to reveal possible T mismatches. PDF quality HR-XRPD measurements have been collected on x=0.10, 0.25 and 0.35 samples at 90 K. Data up to Qmax 27.5 Å -1 were fast Fourier transformed after data reduction to get the G(r) functions For additional PDF quality XRPD measurements on all the samples at 90 K we used the area detector of ID22 (λ=0.1771 Å, Qmax= 28.5 Å -1 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>All solid solution members are cubic down to 10 K. The cell volume expands on raising x. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> the Rietveld refinement of the samples x = 0.30 and T= 10 K using the cubic perovskite structural model (space group Pm-3m) is shown as an examples.  At the same time the Williamson-Hall size and strain analysis of data collected at 300 K revealed a micrometric crystallite size for all the sample and an almost linear increase of the micro-strain parameters ε (= Δa/a)) on increasing x.   Figure 6. Experimental G(r) peaks corresponding to the NN Ti-O (A), Sr/Ba-O (B), next NN Ti-O (C) and Sr/Ba-O (D) distances.</p><p>The short-and medium-range structures have been studied by means of PDF analysis through the G(r) function. Analysing G(r) curves for different compositions in a wide range of interatomic distances r allows understanding both nature and coherence length of distortions induced by the different chemical environments of Ba and Sr. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> the short range parts of the G(r) functions collected at 90 K on all the samples are reported. G(r) functions up to 5 Å) were analysed by the direct analysis of peaks using Gaussian functions. In fact, on the one hand, perovskite structure allows labelling each peak with the couple of atoms involved (in case of solid solutions Sr and Ba share the same peaks), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>; on the other hand, symmetry breaks brings to broadening or even splitting of selected peaks. In particular, AFD tilting of TiO6 octahedra (i.e. the low T structure of STO, space group I4/mcm) broadens the Sr/Ba-O peaks (2 nd and 6 th peaks in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), while Ti-O peaks broaden preferentially in case of FE distortions (1 st and 5 th peaks in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>   The same eperimental G(r) functions have been fitted against the above described structuarl models, using the so called Real Space Rietveld analysis as implemented in PDFGui suite of programs. In all cases, bad fits are obtained using the cubic model. On increasing x, the best fits are observed applying the polar Amm2 model. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>   To reconcile the local scale symmetry decrease with the cubic average structure, real space refinements have been applied to larger r values using experimental G(r) functions obtained by High Resolution data using a box car refinement strategy (10 Å wide intervals). The residuals of fits of the G(r)x=0.25 data using either the Pm-3m or Amm2 models are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>. r value are the centroids of each interval. At low r values, the fit quality using Amm2 model is much better than the cubic case. However, the difference start decreasing and the two models supply equivalent fits around 5-6 nm. This suggests that coherently distorted zones are few nanometers wide (poler nano-regions) and they merge to the cubic structure at lagger r values. The emerging scenario is that local polar distortions exist in the SBTO solid solutions and their coherence length depends on the Ba concentration and distribution. The growing polar nanodomains grow up oriented randomly, frustrating their long range ordering and bringing to a cubic structure on average, at least for x≤0.35.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlooks and future developments</head><p>The high Q-resolution of the ID22 beamline made it possible to study the structure of SBTO solid solutions at different length scales, which is of extreme importance to fully understand the structural evolution of locally distorted regions into polar nano-regions. Since BTO undergoes three different structural phase transitions (Pm-3m  P4mm  Amm2  R3m on cooling), it is worth supposing that they (or some of them) could be observed also in SBTO solid solutions by extending measurements toward larger Ba concentrations. We will propose a new experiment aimed at completing the phase diagram of Sr1-xBaxTiO3 system, extending high resolution XRPD measurements to the 0.35&lt;x&lt;1 compositional range. PDF quality measurements will be carried out at 90 K; the HR setup will allow observing G(r) amplitudes at r values up to the range of teens of nanometers. In this way, it will be possible to reveal whether long range phase transition are driven by the percolation of distorted domains or by some more subtle mechanism as in the case of Pr-doped STO. Parallel to the diffraction investigation, the same group of proponent is carrying out also Raman measurements and ab-initio (DFT) calculations on the same compositions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
