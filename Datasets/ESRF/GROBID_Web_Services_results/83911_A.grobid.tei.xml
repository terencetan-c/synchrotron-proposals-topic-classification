<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Red-emitting phosphors based on fluorides doped by Mn 4+ can be used in combination with yellow/green emitting phosphors such as YAG:Ce or other garnet compositions to achieve warm white light (CCTs&lt;5000 K on the blackbody locus, color rendering index (CRI) &gt;80) from a blue LED, equivalent to that produced by current fluorescent, incandescent and halogen lamps.</p><p>One of these matetials is K2SiF6:Mn 4+ , is being produced in the LumiLab research group and investigated for luminescent applications. To improve the production process we decided to study the precursor material: K2MnF6, which was (wrongly) assumed to contain only Mn 4+ ions. The oxidation state of Mn ions has been investigated in the past using mostly XANES and ELNES. To accurately determine the oxidation state of the Mn ions we measured the XANES spectra of several Mn reference compounds (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) at the DUBBLE beamline, ESRF, Grenoble, France. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the XANES spectra of the various reference compounds, besides the dependency on the oxidation state also a dependency on the neighbourhood can be observed.  The determination of the oxidation state of Mn using XANES has been reported using several ways: PCA, fingerprinting using (the derivatives of ) reference spectra, linear combinations of (the derivatives of ) reference spectra,… We chose to determine the oxidation state using linear combinations of the derivatives of reference spectra. It is always preferable to work with this first derivative, since the spectroscopic structure is clearer and possible errors in post edge normalization do not change the shape of dχ(E)/dE. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> the derivative of the fluoride Mn compounds are shown. Since no reference material for Mn 4+ in a fluorine environment is present first a trend was made between the single valent Mn compounds and their absorption edge energy. The absorption edge energy was defined as the first maximum in the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. A linear fit was performed, the results are depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>Based on the values displayed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, we calculate that the absorption edge energy associated with tetravalent Mn in a fluorine environment is 6557.5 ± 4.4 eV. In we take a closer look at Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we indeed observe a peak around 6559 eV, well consistent with this value. The next step is calculating the presence of the different oxidations states of Mn in K2MnF6. For this purpose all the first peaks in the first derivative of the XANES spectra of the reference compounds were fitted using a Gaussian function:</p><p>A Gaussian was also fitted to the peak in the first derivative of the XANES spectrum of K2MnF6 that is located around 6559 eV. The results are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. Subsequently the first derivative spectrum of K2MnF6 is fitted using all these four Gaussians to check the presence of other oxidation states. In this analysis the b and c parameters are fixed (values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>), and only the amplitudes of the Gaussians is determined. From the results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, we can conclude that the fraction of metallic Mn and divalent Mn are negligible. The fractions of trivalent and tetravalent Mn are determined using the fitting results and are 21% and 79% respectively. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: XANES spectra of Manganese reference compounds and K2MnF6.
