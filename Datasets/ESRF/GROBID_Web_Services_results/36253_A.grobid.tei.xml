<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fluorescence EXAFS data were collected on the dedicated chamber operative at the GILDA beamline. The monochromator was equipped with a Si(111) crystal pair and was run in dynamically focusing mode. The rejection of higher order harmonics was achieved by using a pair of Pt mirrors with an energy cutoff of 10 keV. X-ray fluorescence of the samples was measured by means of a thirteen elements Ge detector. The samples were obtained according to the following protocol: i) Sputtering in vacuum (10 -2 mbar) of ZnO onto an Al 2 O 3 single crystals (11-20), ( <ref type="formula">0001</ref>) and (1-102) at Room Temperature (RT). The layer thickness was checked by X-ray reflectivity and resulted to be 150 Å. The chemical state of the layer was checked by X-ray diffraction and resulted to be metallic ZnO. ii) Firing of the ZnO layer with the substrate. The treatments were carried out at 300°C for 20 minutes and 800°C for different amount of time in air. For comparison purposes the EXAFS spectra in conventional transmission mode of ZnO and ZnAl 2 O 4 powders were also collected.</p></div>

In particular:</p><p>1) (11-20) orientation: at 800 °C the spinel is formed and the amount of spinel increases with time, the sample appearing totally reacted after 2 hours at 800 °C.</p><p>2) (0001) orientation: at 800 °C a chemical reaction takes place, the product of which is different from both the spinel and ZnO. At the moment the chemical nature of this product has been not yet identified.</p><p>3) (1-102) orientation: The behaviour of this orientation is strongly resembling of that previously described for the (0001) orientation.</p><p>4) In addition, linear dichroism measurements at the Zn K-edge for the samples treated at 300°C showed that the ZnO thin film is highly oriented when deposited onto Al 2 0 3 (11-20) and ( <ref type="formula">0001</ref>) surfaces (the orientation of the film is with the c-axis of the wurtzite crystal structure perpendicular to the surface), while onto the Al 2 0 3 (1-102) surface a polycrystalline film is formed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figura 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figura 1: Zn K-edge XANES spectra of ZnO onto Al 2 O 3 (11-20) single crystal after different treatments.
