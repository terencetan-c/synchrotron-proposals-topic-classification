<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Cu 2 OSeO 3 is the first discovered insulator material exhibiting skyrmions under magnetic field at 60K. All of the studies on skyrmions in Cu 2 OSeO 3 have been performed on bulk crystals. The effect of crystal size, specifically when it reaches the skyrmion size i.e. 60nm, has never been explored. We have established a low temperature process based on a hydrothermal treatment of CuSeO 3 .2H 2 O to grow narrow size distribution crystals of Cu 2 OSeO 3 with diameter ranging from 30nm to 25microns.</p><p>In order to study the process at ESRF in same hydrothermal conditions than the ones running at the Crystal Growth Facility, we designed and developed a novel furnace. The hydrothermal process takes place in a 70micron diameter sealed capillary, which is filled at 80% of its volume. During the XRD experiments, the capillary is sitting on a high thermal conductivity aluminum holder ensuring temperature homogeneity in the entire volume of the capillary. The holder is placed in double silica tube. Between the silica walls, a metal wire is coiled and serves as heating element. During the XRD measurements, three thermocouples probe the temperature at each extremity of the capillary and one in the center underneath the X-Ray beam.  Figure 2: (left) Capillary filled with the hydrothermal medium. Cu 2 OSeO 3 crystals appears in green in the capillary. (middle) time dependent XRD pattern recorded during the hydrothermal treatment of CuSeO 3 . (right) Cu 2 OSeO 3 conversion factor versus hydrothermal time</p><p>We successfully run measurements up to 350Â°C and recorded 500ms patterns during hydrothermal treatment (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We could follow the chemical conversion of CuSeO 3 .2H 2 O into Cu 2 OSeO 3 by X-Ray diffraction. From these data, we measured temperature dependent kinetic and obtained the activation energy of the chemical processes (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>One paper is in preparation on the furnace design and performances as well as the first in-situ investigation of hydrothermal treatment using the furnace. These first sucessful results lead to the submission of a regular proposal (01-02-1206). We were allocated 15 more shifts to complete the parametric study of the growth process. This chemical study will be reported in a second paper.</p><p>1000/T % Ln(k%in%s ,1</p><p>) % Ea=33kJ/mol%</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
