<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have continued the examination of chromatin in single cell nuclei by small angle X-ray scattering using the ID13 scanning µSAXS setup at room temperature. In addition we used the new micro-goniometer of ID13 at 100 K. In the latter case we expected to be able to irradiate the cells longer than at room temperature without loss of SAXS pattern. In both cases a 5 µm beam was used. The slit system, used by both setups, has now been stabilized and no further beam drifts were observed. It will nevertheless be necessary to add an online beam intensity monitor in order allow more quantitative data analysis.</p><p>In the case of the microgoniometer we determined a resolution limit of 30 nm based on rats tail collagen. This value could probably be further improved. In order to reduce background scattering, we placed a Helium filled tube between detector and sample. We used human HeLa cells, which were, however, quick-frozen using standard biocrystallography techniques. Thus we transferred a cell in a mixture of glycol and buffer and placed it inside a Hampton nylon loop. The size of the cell nucleus is less than 10 µm diameter. This was then quick-frozen to 100 K using the standard Oxford cryoflow system. The on-line observation of the sample (1) allowed positioning the cell inside the beam with µm precision.</p><p>In the case of scanning µSAXS experiments we scanned again single human HeLa cells which had been grown on the walls of 300 µm diameter glass capillaries. The cells were kept inside the buffer and experiments were performed at room temperature. We also examined T7 cells. The resolution of the SAXS camera was optimized so that the first order of rats tail collagen could be separated from the beamstop (65 nm). A MAR CCD was used for data collection. We performed both line-scans and mesh scans across whole cells. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.a shows the SAXS pattern of a HeLa cell recorded with the microgoniometer within 120 sec. No visual sample damage was evident after this experiment. It was verified that the Nylon loop did not contribute to the pattern. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.b shows the corresponding azimuthally averaged pattern. We note that the pattern corresponds very well to patterns reported in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(2)</ref>. In particular we observe a very strong band at about s≈0.16 nm -1 which has been attributed to intranucleosomal scattering. It is also interesting to note that the 2D-pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.a) shows already an on-set of texture of this band which will be interesting to follow up during mitosis.</p><p>The experiments with HeLa cell using the scanning µSAXS setup resulted in a destruction of the sample within about 15 sec as evident from the optical images. We nevertheless observed basically the same features as at 100 K which suggests that the chromatin had retained its organization sufficiently long to allow the formation of a SAXS pattern. The statistics was, however, worse and features like the s≈0.16 nm -1 band have become very weak. We were able, however, to see an additional band at s≈0.025 nm -1 which has been associated with an interfibre interference (2). We probably could get better statistically more significant patterns by improving the sample environment (less buffer solution, flat sample container instead of capillary and somewhat lower temperatures). This issue should be further explored in future experiments. 0.065 nm -1 0.05 nm -1 ? 0.1 nm -1 s (nm -1 ) log I(s)*s</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig.1.a Fig.1.b ≈0.16 nm -1</figDesc><graphic coords="3,29.01,248.93,220.80,220.32" type="bitmap" /></figure>
