<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the experiment MA1113, we in-situ characterized 3 types of flip chip Pb-free solder under two different electromigration testing conditions. The aim of the experiment is to study the void initial sites induced by electron flows and the void growth rate. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives the summary of the sample we examined. Type UBM Solder Current Density Temperature 7.5MA/cm 2 1 Ti/Cu/Cu(7.5um) SN100C 10MA/cm 2 130degC 7.5MA/cm 2 2 Ti/Cu/Cu(7.5um) SAC1205 10MA/cm 2 130degC 7.5MA/cm 2 3 e-less Ni(5 um)/Au SN100C 10MA/cm 2 130degC</p><p>We powered six chips at the same time. Around every 24hrs, we took the samples out of the furnace and scanned them by white beam x-ray. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the schematic diagram of the sample structure. There are two bumps on each sample, the electron flow comes from the bottom of Bump B and then goes through the Al trace on the top of these two solders, finally it goes out of the bottom of the Bump A. Therefore the upper right corner of Bump A is the entering point of the electron flow, which is so-called current crowding region.</p><p>The current crowding region is believed to be the initial site of the void formation induced by electromigration. After the nucleation of the void, it will grow through the interface between solder and the UBM, as the direction of the electron current redistribution. Electromigration, basically, is a long-term diffusion phenomenon. Under a typical accelerating testing condition, hundreds of hour will be needed, or even more until the failure finally happens. In our study, we monitored what happened inside testing solders from time to time and got the information of the electronmigration effect at early stages. Figure 2(a) A schematic diagram of the cross-section of the solder joint, showing the configuration and dimensions of the sample. Figure 2(b)-(d) show the crosssectional slices reconstructed by SRCL of the sample I at the interface between the solder ball and UBM before, after 13 hr, and 77 hr of EM test, respectively, under a current density of 7.5×10 3 A/cm 2 at 125 • C. Figure 2(e)-(g) show cross-sectional slices of the sample II, before, after 13 hr, and 77 hr of EM test respectively under a current density of 1×10 4 A/cm 2 at 125 • C. Clearly, our results confirm the theory of electromigraion, indicating that the mainly voids was formed from the current crowding point. However, what is unexpected is there is not only one dominated void existing inside, but several small voids formed at the same time. This effect has never been founded by traditional SEM examination. The longest EM treatment is about 77 hours, when there is still no resistance change appeared. Actually the late stage of the real failure is also of interest. Since the beamtime is limited, we did not see it. For comparison, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the evolution of the interfaces of two unpowered solder bumps, which only suffered 130degC thermal aging. Compared to the image taken at 0hr, after 77hrs, there are also several small voids founded at the interface, which means the reaction between UBM and solder body can introduce vacancy saturation and thus void nucleation. This finding is new and worth a more deep study, however, it will not invalid the theory of electromigration, since in this case the distribution of voids is clearly random. Figure 4 shows the SEM images of the cross-section of the same kind of solder bump. In the Figure, we can see the pancake void propagate through the upper interface from the entrance point of electron flows in one unfailed solder, and the other image shows a failed the solder at the later stage of eletronmigration. Additionally, the FIB images show the details of the pancake region. If we can have more beamtime, the later stage evolution of the solder bump until it fails is expected to see. Figure 4 We have published part of the results in Applied Physcis Letters (Abstract is attached in the end of this report).

The Johnson-Mehl-Avrami phase transformation theory is proposed to provide a physical link to the statistical model and to estimate the lifetime of the joints at early stages.</p></div>
