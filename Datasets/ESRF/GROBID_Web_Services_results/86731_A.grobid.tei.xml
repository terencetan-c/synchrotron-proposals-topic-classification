<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Highly dispersed supported Pt particles have various industrial applications as catalysts, such as in the case of catalytic reforming. In this process a bi-functional catalyst is needed, where the acidity of the alumina support is enhanced by chlorine. The objective of the experiment was to clarify the proximity of the metallic and acid sites, by searching for changes in the electronic state of Pt and its local structure when Cl is present on the surface, using High Energy Resolved Fluorescence Detection XANES and EXAFS. Our samples consist of Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 -Cl catalysts with varying Pt and Cl loadings, prepared using two γ-alumina supports (A and B) with differing sizes and morphologies (A: 12.5x6x5 nm, round ;B: 14.5x9x4, rectangular), obtained from a different boehmite nature. During our first experiments (experimental report n° 30-02-1120) re-oxidation of ex situ reduced samples was found to occur during acquisition. Thus, in this present work, the catalysts were re-reduced in situ using an operando cell developed at the Institut Néel under pure H 2 at 500°C (XANES scans were used to follow the thermal treatment). The thermal treatment took around 3h.XANES and EXAFS data acquisition on the Pt L 3 edge was performed under He after cooling to RT and purge of H 2 , with the exception of one sample for which data was also collected at RT under H 2 . In total, 8 Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 -Cl catalysts were studied after in situ reduction. Ex situ analysis was performed for 4 more catalysts in oxide state and for 3 platinum references. Depending on the platinum content of the catalysts, data acquisition took 4-6h or 8-10h. Data processing is still ongoing and the fitting of the EXAFS data will be essential to clarify the results. The use of an operando reactor allowed for some extra observations. First, the XANES scans recorded during the re-reduction thermal treatment show, with increasing temperature: 1) an evolution of the white line (WL) towards lower energies, compatible with Pt reduction, 2) the post-edge feature at 11572 eV becomes clearer (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Second, the influence of adsorbed H 2 on Pt was accessed for the one sample for which data was acquired both under H 2 and under He: 1%Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 .B-1.3%Cl. In the absence of adsorbed H 2 , 1) the WL is slightly shifted to lower energies and 2) the post-edge feature at 11572 eV disappears (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This is in agreement with previous findings by our group on the influence of H 2 on 0.3%Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref>, and it suggests that the presence of Cl has little observable impact on the general trend of the electronic state changes caused by H 2 adsorption already observed for non-Cl containing catalysts. Now focusing on the impact of Pt and Cl contents on the metal's electronic state, the XANES spectra of oxide catalysts supported on γ-Al 2 O 3 .B are compared to those on γ-Al 2 O 3 .A, featured in our first experiment report (n° 30-02-1120). Visually, the XANES spectra of Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 .B-Cl oxide samples show two main "states" that pair the samples with the same Cl content (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, right). The energy position of the WL is nearly the same. The two "states" are distinguishable mainly by a difference in WL intensity: samples with the highest chlorine content present lower WL intensity than samples with the least chlorine content. Lower WL intensity may be associated with an increased occupancy of the d band, which can indicate a transfer of electrons towards the metal, in agreement with previous calculations (ref.</p><p>2). On the other hand, the XANES spectra of Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 .A oxide samples showed also two "states" that pair the samples with the same Pt content (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, left). For each pair, the sample with the highest chlorine content also exhibits a lower WL intensity than sample with the least chlorine. While difficult to interpret, the difference between the results for the two alumina supports hints at an influence of the support on the impact of the Cl on the metallic phase. Since the main difference between the two aluminas is their crystallite morphology, this support effect may be associated with different anchoring sites for Pt and/or Cl present on each alumina.</p><p>For the samples re-reduced in situ with data acquired under He, the XANES spectra are all similar. The EXAFS Fourier Transform shows three main signals in the ranges 1.5-2 Å, 2-2.5 Å and 2.5-3 Å. Interpretation of this data will be heavily dependent on its fitting.
