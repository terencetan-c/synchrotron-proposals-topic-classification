<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>New generations of nuclear reactors require the development of innovative methods to elaborate nuclear fuels. Within this framework, studies have been devoted to the hydrothermal conversion of An(IV) oxalates (An = Th, U, Np, Pu) which allows the direct and quantitative precipitation of hydrated oxides from solution. In this frame, our group is currently studying the hydrothermal conversion of uranium(IV)-cerium(III) mixed oxalates into oxides, cerium being used as a surrogate for plutonium. These two elements can exist in several oxidation state in solution, thereby inducing a complex redox behaviour during hydrothermal treatment. Monitoring the variation in the degree of oxidation of uranium continuously during hydrothermal conversion using in situ XAS analysis should enable us to understand the mechanisms by which uranyl ions are reduced by oxalates, to obtain kinetic information about this reduction, and also to monitor the speciation of uranium in solution and in the precipitated solid.</p><p>In order to explore the redox mechanisms driving the reductive hydrothermal conversion of uranyl ions to UO2+x, in situ XANES analyses were carried out on ESRF BM30-FAME beam line. The FAME line is specifically designed for X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses in the field of materials and the environment. During experiments carried out on this line, it is possible to use internally heated autoclaves developed at the Institut Néel, mainly for in situ XAS studies in hydrothermal fluids at moderate temperature and pressure (T &lt; 800°C, P &lt; 2000 bars). The XANES spectra were acquired at the U-L3 edge (about 17.166 keV). Also, the inner cell, containing the reaction mixture, can be moved vertically, allowing the beam to interact with different zones during the experiments. The study focused on monitoring the degree of oxidation of uranium in solution and within the precipitate formed rapidly during hydrothermal treatment, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> below. An almost complete reduction of uranium(VI) in solution was observed, as well as a change in its complexation caused by the decomposition of oxalate entities under the combined effect of pressure and temperature.</p><p>Similarly, the decrease in the fluorescence intensity in solution was correlated with the rapid precipitation of uranium, which followed a first-order kinetic law. In addition, the study of the solid phase showed that uranium(IV), coming from the rapid reduction of uranyl ions in solution, precipitated directly as UO2+x, which provides new insights into the formation mechanisms of tetravalent actinide hydrated oxides. Furthermore, no variation in the degree of oxidation of uranium within the solid was detected under the conditions of the analysis.</p><p>The white line of the spectra recorded on the solid fraction did not vary with the duration of the hydrothermal treatment and the complexation of uranium remained constant within the precipitate. Thus, no signal corresponding to the U(OH)4 (s) species was observed. In the literature, some authors have questioned the equilibrium to be considered for the formation of hydrated oxide from U 4+ cation in solution and proposed the following two equilibria:</p><p>𝑈 4+ + 4 𝑂𝐻 -↔ 𝑈(𝑂𝐻) 4 → 𝑈𝑂 2 • 𝑛𝐻 2 𝑂 (Eq. 1)</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑈 4+ + 4 𝑂𝐻 -→ 𝑈𝑂 2 • 𝑛𝐻 2 𝑂 + (2 -𝑛) 𝐻 2 𝑂 (Eq. 2)</formula><p>Our observations show that under the conditions studied, the precipitated phase is directly the hydrated oxide, and that the U(OH)4 species is only a potential reaction intermediate, existing only for a very short time. The equilibrium to be considered should therefore be that of Equation 2. Our various observations are summarised in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, which can be seen below. These results, obtained through a novel experiment using cutting-edge techniques, provide a more accurate reaction scheme for the hydrothermal conversion process. This series of experiments therefore demonstrated that the precipitated solid is directly UO2+x.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Sofian Benarib, CEA/ICSM * Maëva Munoz, CEA/ICSM * Nicolas Clavier, CNRS/ICSM * Nicolas Dacheux, University of Montpellier/ICSM * Jean-Louis Hazemann, CNRS/ESRF *</figDesc></figure>
