<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Interwoven Metal-Organic Framework with Nanoporous and Magnetic Properties The main objective of the work was the structural resolution, using Synchrotron Radiation facilities, of magnetic two-and three-dimensional open-framework structures based on metal ions and organic radicals acting as ligands. The exceptional characteristics of nanoporous materials have prompted their application in different fields such as molecular sieves, sensors, ion-exchangers, and catalysis. The use of synchrotron radiation facilities was highly required due to recurrent obtaining of really small single crystal, even too small to be solved by conventional CCD techniques. Moreover, their high insolubility difficult any recrystallization experiment to improve the size as well as the quality of the crystals so far obtained.</p><p>The results obtained during the last experiment (12 shifts) were really impressive.</p><p>During the four days used for the experiment, nine structures were resolved, three of them exhibiting interesting nanoporous structures with very large pores, in the 3-4 nm range, and intriguing intramolecular connections. Hereby is the list and a brief description of the aforementioned structures and the most remarkable results:</p><p>A) A complex of Co(II) with the radical 2 in a stoicheometric form of 3:2, with molecules of pyridine completing the octahedral geometry of the Co(II) ions. The unit cell of such complex has a large volume, nearly 27000Ã… 3 . Moreover, its crystal packing shows the presence of nanopores.</p></div>

The supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds and ?-? interactions between these two components originate large nanopores with size of ca. 3 nm.</p><p>C) Two different crystalline phases of radical 1. One of these two structures is very interesting because forms polar micropores due to the presence of eight carboxylic groups forming the walls of such channels. D) A monomeric Co(II) complex with an octaedrical geometry formed by two molecules of radical 2 and four water ligands.</p><p>E) A monomeric Zn(II) complex with an octaedrical geometry formed by two molecules of radical 2 and four water ligands.</p><p>F) A complex of Co(II) with radical 2 and 4,4'-bipyridine.</p><p>G) A complex of TTF with Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions, which forms a three dimensional framework.</p><p>Now, we are working to refine all these structures. Moreover, we are analyzing the behavior of complexes with nanopores as zeotype materials and studying their magnetic properties. We expect that at the end of September three or four different papers containing the structures solved in ESRF will be completed and submitted. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>This is a preliminary report of the experiments carried out at the ESRF past July (CH-1236), which is being submitted together with a new application form.
