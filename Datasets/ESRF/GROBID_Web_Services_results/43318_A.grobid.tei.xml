Briscoe*, University of Bristol and University of Oxford Dr Robert Jacobs*, University of Oxford Dr Robert K. Thomas, University of Oxford Dr Peixun Li,* University of Oxford Miss Francesca Speranza*, University of Bristol Mr. Thomas Dane*, University of Bristol Miss Jennifer Bulpett*, University of Bristol Mr. Philip Cresswell*, University of Bristol Report:</p><p>This has been a very successful and highly productive experiment in several aspects, as summarised below.</p><p>1) The measurements were carried out by using two liquid cells that house the samples. We designed and constructed the cells and the main body for which is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. They have been used for previous measurements (at ID10B and BM28) and will be used for future related measurements, and could also be adapted to neutron reflectometry experiments. We carried out two main sets of experiments.</p><p>2) We studied the interaction between three components: a polymer, Polyethyleneimine (PEI, linear, 50 ppm), a perfluorinated surfactant, Cesium Perfluorononanoate (CsPFN, 1 cmc) and a salt, NaNO 3 (50 mM). This system was previously examined and it led to the appearance of some interesting Bragg peaks. Hence, we firstly looked at the effects of varying the temperature of the system. PTC heaters were connected to the liquid cell, allowing to increase the system temperature from about 24°C (hutch temp.) to 39 °C. We found that the Bragg peaks disappear upon heating (see fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), suggesting that they are due to hydrated liquid crystal formation of the CsPFN surfactant below its Krafft temperature (~40°C). Secondly, since the PEI is a strong polyelectolyte at low pH, the effect of the pH on the system was studied. We found some significant differences between the reflectivity curves of the systems at pH 10 and 7 and the pH 4 system curve. Also by using solutions at different values of pH, the Bragg peaks disappear upon heating. 3) Then we looked at the interaction between Sodium Perfluorononanoate (NaPFN), branched PEI and NaNO 3 . Surfactant and salt concentrations were varied in order to study their effects on the system and we found a geometric response of the layer structure to the change in the solution conditions. The reflectivity varies as the concentration of the surfactant increases from 0.1 cmc to 1 cmc and as the salt solution is added to the PEI-NaPFN mixture. pH and temperature effects have also been examined, and an increase in the system temperature causes the disappearance of some small peaks. 4) We also looked at four C12 chain surfactants: sulphobetaine, phosphocoline, Na dodecyl sulphate and dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. We looked at different surfactants mixtures, varying the total concentration of surfactants mixture and the composition. We found some interesting results, and we would like investigate this system further in possible future experiments. 5) We found that our local contact, Dr Oier Bikondoa, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The beam alignment was non-trival due our gently curved mica surface geometry. Dr Bikondoa was very careful and patient with us. 6) Overall, we anticipate 2 manuscripts to be submitted as a result of every single set of experiment. 7) We find the analysis of the XRR data from mica non-trivial and are in the process of seeking help from several collaborators.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.
