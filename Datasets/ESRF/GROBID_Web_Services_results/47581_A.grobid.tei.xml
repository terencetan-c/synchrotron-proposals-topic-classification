<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In previous synchrotron SAXS studies conducted in 2009 (Proposal No. SC-2774) at beamline BM02 unpredictable results were obtained for gelled nanoparticle systems comprising different polysaccharide and when these were subjected to varying pH. The existence of a core-shell morphology in the various nanoparticle systems was inferred from the goodness of fit of the corresponding model used to describe the intensity scattering curves in a given q region, particularly in systems that comprised either chitosan or in those comprising chitosan and alginate and in both cases when a chemical crosslinking agent, genipin, was used to modify the surface of the harnessed particles. The thickness of the formed shell was found to be influenced by the composition of the system, the pH and the ionic strength. In these new experiments, we have refined and expanded the former studies, with particular attention to the following aspects: a) By deepening our understanding of the surface molecular topolgy, interactions and structure of the nanoparticles modelled as centrosymmetric spheres of with radial variation of electron density. 1 b) By characterizing the sensitivity of the nanoparticles towards changes in composition of the polyelectrolytes, crosslinking agents and presence of protein/peptide macromolecules, particularly, insulin, lysozyme and a glycoprotein, mucin. c) By characterizing pH-and salt-induced transitions in terms of the dimensions of their core and shell in a range of pH emulating physiological conditions. d) By initiating preliminary studies focused on modified proteins with affinity to chitosan.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment I</head><p>The SAXS intensity curves of CS-TPP-alginate nanoparticles either blank or loaded with insulin and either surface crosslinked or not were recorded in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2) or in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8). But as the slope of the plot log I vs log q invariable assumend values larger than 4.0, the classical Porod's treatment is not applicable and a modified core-shell model had to be used whereby the interfacial thickness of the NPs could be calculated, using the following equation 2,3 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( )</formula><p>Where C and B are the Porod's and the interface constants, respectively.</p><p>The value of the interface of transition layer (shell) L i can be calculated from the expression:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>√</head><p>The result of this analysis is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For all the nanoparticles studied in this experiment, it was was possible to fit the core-shell model and estimate average values of shell thickness. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the summary of these analysis for the various addressed nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) does not allow core shell structure does exist in CS-TPP based nanoparticles. The insulin release behavior of these nanoparticle systems has also been addressed and has revealed that the systems that are crosslinked with genipin are able to retain insulin in SGF, while those which are not crosslinked, release the protein almost immediately under these conditions. This behavior cannot be ascribed to a change in the nanoparticle shell thickness, as no differences were noticed between uncrosslinked and crosslinked nanoparticles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). It was interesting to notice, however, that in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8), the insulin loaded nanoparticles that were crosslinked exhibited a larger interfacial thickness than that attained in SGF and also than the non-crosslinked particles in SIF. These differences reveal that the shell of the particles is able to react to the external environment and that changes in the degree of protonation of chitosan, alginate and insulin are surely at play in determining the behavior of these systems. Ultimately, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at molecular level, shall lead to the better tuning of the stability and drug release properties of these systems.  6 8 10 12 14 Shell Thickness (A) pH 1.2 pH 6.8</p><p>(3) Experiment III.</p><p>The molecular interactions between the soluble fraction of porcine gastric mucin when mixed at varying mass ratio with different polysaccharides are being currently investigating by rheological methods. An interaction between mucin and alginate has been hypothesized to occur, particularly at mucin/alginate mass ratios &gt; ca. 0.7. Differences in the interaction behavior have also been observed as a function of the Mw of alginate, pH and ionic strength. For a better understanding of these phenomena, SAXS experiments were carry out. The scattering intensity obtained can be represented by the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation (Eq. 3) describing the scattering behavior of a gel in dilute conditions or semi diluted solutions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> ( )</p><p>Where, I(q) is the observed corrected intensity at a given q value, Io is the incident initial intensity,  is the mesh size. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the results of these experiments.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows a linearization of the OZ equation for mucin and for alginatemucin systems wehereby one can calculate the mesh size of the blob, meaning the space in which a single polymeric chain does not interact with other chains.</p><p>In the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> represented the scattering pattern of the solutions of mucin alone and in the presence of 10% alginate (Mw 102 kDa). Reorganization of the chains and conformational changes of tertiary structure of mucin seem to be at play to modify the mesh size values and this can be due to the presence of the interacting polymer or simply due to a dilution effect. In a new experiment it would be important to test several concentration of samples and different ratio for clarify if this effect due to a dilution effect or a change in the distribution of the polymer in solutions and also try to found a correlation model between the data obtain by SAXS and the once obtained by viscosimetry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Experiment IV Nanocomplexes (NCXs) made of alginate (Mw 4 kDa)lysozyme at a charge ratio of 0.285 and a total amount of charge in solution of 6 meq/L with an average size of 225 ±3.7 nm and surface zeta potential of -35 ± 3 mV were addressed. NCXs were diluted with NaCl solution to afford a 4mM concentration of NaCl. Both NCXs systems exhibited a negative zeta potential, diagnostic evidence to the preferential occurrence of alginate on the surface. The SAXS experiment allowed us to observe only the Porod's law region (where Eq. 4 is met) and not the Guinier's one, due to the large size of the NPs using the following equation: 7</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>( )</head><p>But as the slope is larger than 4.0 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>), the classical Porod's treatment is not applicable. The interpretation of this value is concordant whit interfacial transition between the NPs and the solvent. The use of the modified Porod's law (Eq. 1) allowed us to obtain the interfacial thickness of the NPs, using the plot shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> B and applying equation 1 used to treat the CS-TPPalginate nanoparticle systems of experiment I above.</p><p>The decrease in the size of the shell observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> B can be correlated to the reorganization of alginate chain in the surface of the particle due to the increase in the ionic strength and also to the binding between of sodium ions with the guluronic unit present in alginate. To investigate in greater depth this NCX system, a new comparative SAXS study with alginates of different Mw and mannuronic and guloronic acid (M/G) ratios will be extremely informative. Experiment V.</p><p>Preliminary experiments were initiated in the characterization of a new type of proteins that are being engineered in our Institutue at WWU with a view to use them as fluorescent labeling tools for chitin-and chitosan-based nanosystems. It was possible conduct SAXS measurements in the protein in both situations, in the free state and when bound to its substrate.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the SAXS intensity scattering curves for the CAP-GFP and CAP-GFP bound to chitosan oligomer. Clearly, in both systems it is possible to observe the Guinier region at low q values. The insert shows the linearized form</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(5)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>of Guniers plot (log I vs q 2 ), from which it is possible to obtain the radius of gyration of the systems, according with the following equations 7</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( ) ( ) ( )</formula><p>The obtained results are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. It is interesting to notice that when the CAP-GFP protein is bound to its substrate, a reduction in R g equivalent to 0.625 nm is observed. To a first approximation, the differences in dimensions between the bound and free state of the protein may reflect structural changes which may be possibly associated to a slight change in conformation as the chitosan oligomer binds to CAP binding site. Differences in the order of 0.4 nm (4 Å) have been documented for varying conformational states of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), the enzyme responsible for the first ATP-generating step of glycolysis, upon complexing to its substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> These preliminary results allow to anticipate that it would be extremely interesting to proble by SAXS the interactions between chitosan longer polymer chains and chitosan-based nanoparticles in solution.</p><p>SUBMITTED PUBLICATIONS Goycoolea F.M., Valle-Gallego A., Stefani R., Mencicchi B., David L., Rochas C., Santander-Ortega M.J., Alonso M.J.
