<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The catalysts investigated consisited of an industrially relevant (60/30/10) and high copper loading (80/10/10) Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst which had also been doped with 1wt.% Cs2O. A series of reductions, as presented in the table below, were performed on each of these catalysts on the ID15a beamline at the ESRF. For each experiment, 0.3 g of sieved catalyst was packed into a 5 mm quartz capillary (see photography on page 2) and 10 mL min -1 reducing gas was flowed. XRD-CT data was collected across 3 planes of the catalyst bed (bottom, middle, top) at room temperature, when 230 o C (reduction temperature) was reached and at the end of reduction; point measurements were also collected along the bed throughout the whole reduction process. We are currently in the process of analysing the data, however, initial analysis shows that there is a difference in the reduction behaviour depending on the position in the bed and inclusion of the Cs-dopant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exp. # Sample Gas [H2]/Ar (%) GHSV (h</head><p>Included is an example of the information we can gain from these experiments. An advantage of collecting the point measurements is that we are able to follow the evolution of the active Cu phase along the bed.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows that there is no real difference in reduction behaviour as a function of bed height for the 60/30/10 Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in 5% H2/Ar. However, when we consider the XRD-CT data (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), we are able to see that there is a clear distribution of stacking fault probabilities across the bed. This then gives us a new insight into possible deactivation mechanisms occurring in industrial reactors. </p></div>			</div>
