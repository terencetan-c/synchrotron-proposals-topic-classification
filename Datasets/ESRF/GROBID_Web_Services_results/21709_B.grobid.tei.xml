<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Background</head><p>Dose enhancement in human radiotherapy is a proven way to improve tumor local control, but it is limited by healthy tissue tolerance. Continuing researches are done to improve tumor lethal damages with respect of surrounding tissues (drug sensitization; contrast mediated dose enhancement…). Two approaches are particularly attractive, the use of high relative biological effectiveness ion beams and tumor targeted irradiation sources as classical brachytherapy or metabolic radiation therapy. The Photon Activation Therapy (PAT) is a combination of these two approaches: a selective excitation of high-Z compound fixed inside DNA tumor should allow radio-toxicity enhancement, thanks to the increase of local dose deposition. Actually, photon-stimulation of these heavy elements induces ejection of an internal electron by photoelectric effect. The following electronic rearrangement may lead to Auger electrons cascades. This phenomenon, predominant with light elements, occurs with lower probabilities with high-Z atoms; nevertheless, energies needed for their resonant excitation are higher and consequently suitable for external radiotherapy. Because of their very short range, these Auger electrons could be very toxic for tumor cells, but only if they are released in the close vicinity of their DNA. This experiment, that we previously tried but failed due to bacterial contamination of the biological material (see report number LS1698b) aimed at expose cultured cells to different agents chosen as being mildly or not toxic for cells. Actually, in previous studies (LS1392 and LS1698a) we suspected that the chemotherapy (CDDP) toxicity was too high to give chance to Auger effect to be seen with survival assay. Therefore, no animal experimentation has been carried out during these shifts, in spite of the title of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods</head><p>We exposed cultured cells to chloro-terpyridine-platinum (a non toxic platinum compound), IudR and Iomeron (non toxic vascular iodinated contrast media). These set of compounds was chosen to allow comparison in-cell and out-cell radiation enhancement effect. A wide range of energies were tuned with the tomography monochromator (among them the different K-edges of the target atoms) to optimize the energy choice. Irradiated cells were sub-cultured after irradiation for colony forming assay.</p><p>At the molecular level we wanted to measure once again the level of double strands breaks induced on living cells pre-treated with cisplatin by the resonant absorption of the irradiation just above the K-edge of platinum. DNA damages quantification was done by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A direct visualization of the location of the damages and the activation of the proteins involved in their repair was done by immunofluorescence experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1°) Survival assays</head><p>We measured dose enhancement factor when irradiation is combined with either external iodine or internal iodine in the cells. External iodine was supplied as radiological contrast agent (Iomeron) and irradiated above and below iodine K-edge (-/+ 33 keV), 50 or 70 keV for a dose range from 0 to 5 Gy. Internal iodine was introduced as iododesoxyuridine (IudR). Irradiated the same way a combination of IudR and Iomeron has also been done. These experimentations have been successful and we established that DEF 10% for Iomeron is 1.1 around iodine K-edge; 2 at 50 keV and 1.5 at 70 keV; for IudR it is 1.4 around iodine Kedge (above or below); 2.6 at 50 keV and 1.35 at 70 keV. And when IudR is combined with Iomeron DEF rises to 1.8 aroud 33 keV and 2.4 at 70 keV, which are unusually high results and show that DNA damages induced by irradiation are cumulative for the two pharmacological agents. It will be very interessant to test this association at 50 keV, the theorical and experimental optimal energy to enhance energy deposit between iodinated and normal tissues.</p><p>We made a first attempt of intracellular photoactivation (PAT) with a new platinum compound: PtTC (chloroterpyridine platinum (II)). PtTC is an organic platinum compound able to intercalate in DNA without covalent bound. Therefore it is no toxic and theoretically high level should be achieved in cells. Such levels should enhance the rate of DNA damage occurred by Auger effect. Results are very preliminary and pharmacological steps must be improved. The continuation of these studies was done in the experimentation LS2121 in February.</p><p>2) Molecular studies of DNA damage and DNA repair pathways In this experimentation, human cells were exposed to CDDP at high concentrations (3 and 30 µM) and irradiated above and below platinum K-edge. Cellular preparations were made for pulsed field electrophoresis; immunofluorescence labeling; and western blot. These results confirm previous results: when irradiated above k-edge, cisplatin increased double strand breaks (DSB) rate with reduced repair kinetic. Repair pathways are predominantly homologous recombination, which is usually the minor pathway of DSB repair. These molecular results are consistent with published data. However we would like to confirm them with other cell lines to be more representative of human tumors.</p></div>		</body>
