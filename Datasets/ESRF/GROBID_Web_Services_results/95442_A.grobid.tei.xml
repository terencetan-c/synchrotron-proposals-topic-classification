<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Overview: Palladium-gallium based catalysts are highly active for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. In spite of this, the origin of this reactivity remains poorly understood. To delineate the origin of this reactivity, we have used surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) to develop a model PdGa catalyst, supported on silica containing surface-isolated Ga sites (PdGa@SiO2). While this system is both highly active and selective in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, the small size (&lt;2 nm) of the nanoparticles obtained by this approach, in combination with the low metal loadings (&lt;4 wt%) preclude structural analysis by lab-based diffraction methods, due to both intrinsic disorder and high signal dispersion. However, using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we have previously been able to show that alloying and de-alloying occur under reaction conditions, and may play a key role in the catalytic performance of these materials. Thus, to gain detailed atomic scale insights into the working catalysts we turned to synchrotron-based pairdistribution function (PDF) analysis. Experiments were designed to enable analysis of the as-synthesized material, the dynamics of the alloy formation, and the how the material evolves under reaction conditionsusing differential pair distribution function (dPDF) analysis to specifically investigate changes to the introduced metals (Ga, Pd) on the atomic scale and beyond. The goals of this study were to (i) gain insight into the catalyst structure and changes thereof under reaction conditions; and (ii) explore how the alloy is formed during synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Obtained and experimental parameters:</head><p>In situ X-ray total scattering data were collected on powdered samples of SiO2, Ga@SiO2, Pd@SiO2 and PdGa@SiO2 using a quartz capillary cell (o.d. 1 mm, i.d. 0.9 mm). All samples were supported on Degussa AEROSIL-200 (204 m 2 g -1 ), to enable efficient subtraction of background signal for dPDF. Additional TPR data for other systems were also recorded (Pt@SiO2, PtMn@SiO2). Data were collected at a detector-to-sampledistance of 30 cm for all experiments, the beam energy was 66 keV. Flow rates (CO2, H2, N2) were controlled via mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and pressure was retained using a back pressure regulator (Bronkhorst, EL-PRESS). Temperatures (50-500 o C) were maintained using a gas blower, temperature calibration was performed using a K-type thermocouple mounted inside a sample cell and the obtained values were used thereafter. A CeO2 NIST standard was utilized to determine dampening and broadening of PDF peaks due to experimental resolution. Outlet gas composition was monitored using a mass spectrometer (MS, Pfeiffer vacuum) mounted directly behind the back-pressure regulator. In a typical experiment, data was acquired at a series of points (50 o C, 150 o C, 230 o C, 300 o C, 400 o C, 500 o C) during temperature-programmed reduction (TPR, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) to track changes during hydrogen treatment The capillary reactor was then cooled to reaction temperature and pressurized (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), before reaction gas introduced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Data was recorded until steady state was obtained (confirmed by MS). A series of comparable dPDF plots for data acquired under identical conditions during TPR (230 o C) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.The attenuation of signal reflects particle size, and illustrates the increased disorder associated with bimetallic materials, when compared to their monometallic counterparts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work and anticipated output:</head><p>Currently the data is being further processed, and the structures simulated with models obtained from expected crystal structures, in addition to insights from XAS and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). A manuscript is expected to be published containing the results of the study of PdGa and Pd, in combination with complementary data from further studies using XAS and DFT calculations, in the coming months. In addition, TPR experiments on the discussed Pt and PtMn systems will be included in a manuscript that is to be submitted in the coming months.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
