<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract: Human IgG4 antibody shows therapeutically-useful properties compared to the IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses. Thus IgG4 does not activate complement, and shows conformational variability. These properties are attributable to its hinge region, which is the shortest of the four IgG subclasses. Using high throughput scattering methods, we have studied the solution structure of wild-type IgG4(Ser222) and a hinge mutant IgG4(Pro222) in different buffers and temperatures, where the proline substitution suppresses the formation of half-antibody. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both IgG4 forms were principally monomeric with sedimentation coefficients s 0 20,w of 6.6-6.8 S. A monomer-dimer equilibrium was observed in heavy water buffer at low temperature. Scattering showed that the X-ray radius of gyration RG was unchanged with concentration in 50-250 mM NaCl buffers, while the neutron RG values showed a concentration-dependent increase as the temperature decreased in heavy water buffers. The distance distribution curves P(r) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2 that shifted below 2 mg/ml to indicate concentration-dependent IgG4 structures, in addition to IgG4 dimer formation at high concentration in heavy water. Constrained X-ray and neutron scattering modelling revealed asymmetric solution structures for IgG4(Ser222) with extended hinge structures. The IgG4(Pro222) structure was similar. Both IgG4 structures showed that their Fab regions were positioned close enough to the Fc region to restrict C1q binding. Our new molecular models for IgG4 explain its inability to activate complement, and clarifies aspects of its stability and function for therapeutic applications.</p><p>(2) Report: Biophysical analysis of aggregation-prone states of antibody Fab antigen-binding fragment.</p><p>Hilton, D.*, Perkins, S. J.* &amp; Dalby, P. A. ( <ref type="formula">2014</ref>) Introduction: Product losses through the formation of aggregates are still a major problem at each stage of a therapeutic protein's life, from its effects on expression within the cell through to the shelf life of the packaged product. These aggregates are typically undesirable since they are a manifestation of the target molecules physical instability and result in both reduced activity and increased immunogenic potential. The aggregation kinetics of a therapeutic Fab have been characterised by us in detail over a wide range of conditions, and aggregation appears to be promoted by a near-native intermediate state in solution. This study investigated the Fab over the same range of conditions, at time-zero prior to aggregation, to identify structural changes in the native protein consistent with an intermediate state. SAXS measurements were performed upon the Fab fragment at a variety of solvent ionic strengths and pHs, and a shift in the radius of gyration was observed predominantly in the more aggregation prone conditions. The shift was consistent with a near-native intermediate state that is strongly pH dependent. The high-throughput capabilities of the BM29 Bio-SAXS beamline enabled 20 solution environments to be examined (5 pH x 4 ionic strengths), with each condition measured in triplicate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radius of gyration and P(r) analyses:</head><p>Scattering curves for the 60 samples, each containing 1mg/ml of Fab', were collected and analysed using AutoRg to estimate the radius of gyration from the Guinier regions. These values were in good agreement with those calculated from integration of the real space distribution functions, P(r), for each of the measurements. Each P(r) plot was characterised by a smooth peak with a single maxima, M, at 2.85 ± 0.03nm and a characteristic length, L, of 9.58 ± 0.32. The deviations in L present are likely to result from the formation of low levels of aggregate within solution. By plotting the protein size as a function of both pH and ionic strength (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) it can be seen that an increasingly acidic environment causes a gradual increase in the measured average radius of gyration of the molecule. This could be explained by relaxation of regions within the molecules structure or subtle changes in conformation, for instance bending at hinges between the domains. The effects of ionic strength are less pronounced except in the case of a highly acidic, low ionic strength system for which the molecules size is much lower than might be expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relating protein conformation to aggregation propensity:</head><p>To identify the protein's susceptibility to aggregate, forced degradation studies were performed with 1 mg/ml Fab' in each of 20 solution environments. Kinetic parameters for each of the conditions were subsequently derived using size exclusion chromatography. A plot of aggregation rate, in the form of monomer half-life, against the protein's radius of gyration at time zero reveals 3 distinct clusters of data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Whilst one such cluster exhibits relative invariance in Rg versus aggregation half-life (mechanism 2), an apparent link between the variables is evident in the other two data clusters (mechanism 1). It is thought that this difference could be attributed competing aggregation mechanisms depending upon the solvent conditions selected. Quantification of the net protein-protein interactions within the system suggest that the aggregation propensity for points following mechanism 2 is colloidally controlled, whilst mechanism 1 is subject to greater conformational control. In addition, mechanism 2 conditions are mostly pH5.5 at which point the strength of salt bridges is at a maximum. We now hypothesise that aggregation is promoted by acidic conditions through increased dynamic and partial unfolding of the structure, while it is also suppressed under conditions which optimise the stability of salt bridges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>A clear link between the initial radius of gyration of a protein and its solvent composition has been identified, particularly its pH and ionic strength. It is well known that both of these variables strongly influence a proteins propensity to aggregate but the mechanism behind this remains only partially understood. SAXS is providing crucial insights into how changes in the protein's structure might be involved in this process.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Rayner, L.
