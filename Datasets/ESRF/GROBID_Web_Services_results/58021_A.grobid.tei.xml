<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned in the project</head><p>proposal? YES. The most significant results will be explained in this session after a short experimental setup description:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Structural and morphological evolutions during different pressure histories were investigated by combining in-situ X-ray measurements and a pressure cell adapted on a multi-pass rheometer (MPR). This experimental setup was used in previous works as a slit flow rheometer, recent modifications allow to reach pressure up to 1000 bar and to carefully control the pressure applied on the polymer specimen. The sample (dimensions are 120 ×6 ×1.5 mm) is confined between two servo hydraulically driven pistons: pressurization and de-pressurization can be imposed by moving the pistons towards or away from each other and the set values of pressure are controlled by mean of two pressure transducer positioned near each piston. Cooling occurs by pumping a cooling medium through the cell (resulting in an average cooling rate ≈ 7°C/min) and a diamond window placed in the middle of the pressure cell allows scattering measurements (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 left</ref>).</p><p>After erasing of the previous thermo-mechanical history at 220°C for 10 min the sample was cooled down to an isothermal crystallization temperature (140°C), keeping the pressure constant at 100 bar to prevent shrinkage holes formation. After temperature stabilization (about one minute), the pressure was increased from 100 bar to the one set for the pulse (ranging from 200 to 700 bar), kept constant for 30 s and then brought back to 100 bar. Both pressure increase and decrease were completed in less than 5 seconds. The structure evolution during and after the pulse was followed by mean of combined WAXD/SAXS. Time resolved Small Angle X-ray Scattering and Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (SAXS and WAXD) measurements were carried out with a wavelength λ =1.033 Å. Acquisition of simultaneously SAXS and WAXD patterns was performed using a Pilatus 1M detector (981×1043 pixels of 172 µm×172 µm placed at a distance of 6.47 m) and a Pilatus 300K detector (1472×195 pixels of 172µm×172 µm placed at a distance of 0.21 m), respectively. The detectors were triggered by an electric TTL pulse at the start of the displacement of pistons during the pressure pulse. The structure evolution during the 30 s pressure pulse was monitored using an exposure time of 5 s, the following 1200 s of isothermal and isobaric crystallization were recorded using an exposure time of 10 s and a waiting time of 20 s. The distance and tilt angle of the SAXS and WAXD detectors were calibrated using rat tail collagen and α-Al 2 O 3 (αaluminium oxide) standard powder, respectively. After correction for the background and air scattering all X-ray images were normalized for synchrotron beam fluctuations using an ionization chamber placed before the sample, and for the sample absorption using a photodiode placed on the beamstop. 2D WAXD and SAXS images were processed with the software package FIT2D to obtain 1D intensity profiles as a function of the scattering angle for WAXD (2θ) and of the scattering vector (q) for SAXS. Crystallinity was calculated after deconvolution of the total intensity scattered by the crystalline (A crystal ) and amorphous (A amorphous ) domains:</p><p>The time evolution of the relative amount of crystals in the γ and α form was measured from the X-ray diffraction profiles, as suggested by Turner-Jones et al.  <ref type="formula">130</ref>) α reflections were evaluated from the area underneath the corresponding diffraction peaks above the diffuse halo in the X-ray powder diffraction profiles. The long period (Lp) was calculated from the Lorentz corrected 1D SAXS intensity profilles by simple application Braggs law: Lp = 2p=q*, where q* is the value of the scattering vector, q = (4π/λ)sinθ, corresponding to the maximum of the correlation peaks of the integrated intensities. The lamellar thickness (lc) could then be estimated as lc = Lp • Xc WAXD , where Xc WAXD is the crystallinity evaluated from WAXD. Another measure of the structural development during the crystallization process can be evaluated using the SAXS invariant (Q SAXS ) evolution defined as:</p><p>where φ is the volume fraction of the crystalline phase, ρ c and ρ a the density of the crystalline and of the amorphous phases, respectively. The degree of space filling was obtained from crystallinity and invariant evolution using:</p><p>where Xc 0 , Q SAXS 0 , X c ∝ , Q SAXS ∝ are the measured values of the crystallinity and of the invariant before the pressure pulse and at the end of the crystallization process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The acceleration of crystallization kinetics after pulses of pressure is confirmed by the on-line Xray observation as evident from the time evolution of crystallinity for experiments performed using the pressure cell combined with synchrotron radiation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 left</ref>). The crystallization happens faster increasing the pressure applied during the pulse and, for the experiments with a pulse of 600 and 700 bar, the material starts to crystallize already during the time experienced at high pressure. The fraction of material crystallized immediately after the pulse for these two experiments is 1.5 to 3% respectively, while the final values of crystallinity is around 60% for all the experiments. Most of the crystal growth occurs upon depressurization at 100 bar, and our initial purpose to separate the nucleation from the growth process, in first approximation, still holds true.</p><p>Interestingly, the evolution of the relative amount of the two different phases formed (i.e. α and γ) does not seem to be affected by the pulses of pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> right): in all the experiments the relative amount of α -and γ -phase is about 50% at the beginning of the crystallization process and evolves to final values of about 70 and 30%, respectively. At these conditions of temperature and pressure (140°C and 100 bar), the growth rate of the α -phase is clearly higher then the one of the γ -phase, in agreement with the observation of van <ref type="bibr">Drongelen et al. [3]</ref> on the same material, and the final amount of α -phase is prevalent. Since the amount of different phases is only dictated by the relative growth rates of the individual phases, this is an indirect evidence that the growth process is not in influenced by the previous thermo-mechanical history (i.e. pressure pulses), and consequently the observed differences in the crystallization kinetics can be ascribed solely to changes in the nucleation density. In other words, extra nuclei are formed during the time experienced at high pressure, although no growth is detectable.</p><p>Further support to this hypothesis is provided by the final values of the ratios of γ and α phases and of the lamellar thickness as a function of the pressure applied during the pulse presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. The ratio between the final amount of γ -and α -phase is about 0.4 and the final value of lamellar thickness is 14 nm independently from the entity of the pressure during the pulse. Clearly, the short time experienced by the material at high pressure does not have any effect on the final structure and morphology, these being affected only by the actual temperature and pressure at which the crystal growth happens. </p></div>
