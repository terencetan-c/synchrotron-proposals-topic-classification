<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>and to correlate this information with the static adsorption/desorption isotherms and the immersion calorimetric results. In-house measurements had been carried out on the original systems, 1 &amp; 2, and on the dried samples, 1a &amp; 2a. Samples 1a &amp; 2a were then immersed in water and their diffractogram recorded. It was shown for both that the resulting diffractograms resembled that of crystalline 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In-house results</head><p>In-situ SNBL measurements</p><p>For the in-situ experiments, carried out at the SNBL, only water vapour adsorption/desorption was studied. They showed that these transformations were more complex than first imagined. Heating 1 does give 1a, but it was observed to first transform to 2, then on continued heating to 2a, and finally to 1a. By passing nitrogen gas saturated with water vapour through the capillary it was possible to observe that 1a does indeed revert to 1. So the process is reversible but the pathway is not direct as was concluded from the in-house measurements. For system 2/2a this transformation was not reversible. Heating 2 does indeed give 2a but on passing a stream of nitrogen gas saturated with water vapour it was seen that 2a transforms to 1 passing through an intermediate stage, that is 1a. This first transformation is very rapid and we need to perfect out experimental system to monitor this more accurately. The in-house methanol adsorption isotherms indicated that the uptake of solvent by compound 2a is a two step process. In view of the results noted above this seems reasonable and we proposse that the first step involves the structural transformation of 2a to 1a followed by the upake of the solvent molecules to form 1. Water adsoption isotherms are particularly long and tedious to carry out but this is being done at the moment. The next step will be to repeat the above in-situ experiments using methanol, to show that the same complex transformation (2 -heat-→ 2a -adding solvent-→ 1aadding solvent-→ 1) is observed. The possibillity of following this experiment by in-situ Raman spectroscopy would also be very interesting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="1,271.56,365.76,380.04,285.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
