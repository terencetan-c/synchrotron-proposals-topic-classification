<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Probing the medium range order dynamics of metallic glasses </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to measure the microscopic dynamics of metallic glasses at different length scales. Therefore, the dynamics were measured in transmission geometry using 8.1 keV coherent radiation and the signal was collected by two CCD detectors mounted at two different q-values in the horizontal scattering plane. On of the q-values was near the maximum of the structure factor S(q), as usually probed in previous measurements of metallic glasses, while the other detector was placed at a smaller angle. The metallic glass samples were selected to have as maximum intensity as possible at the smaller angle detector.</p><p>Some of the samples (Al-Ni-Y compositions) showed a complex aging behavior and small resistance to crystallization during the long isothermals and were discarded. Finally, Vit4 metallic glass, known by its high glass-forming ability and stability against crystallization was used in the experiment. The experimental set-up worked fine and multispeckle series were collected with one detector placed around 2θ=18 o and the other near 2θ=37 o . The figure below shows the dynamics collected at the maximum of S(q) and at the smaller angle. The figures show that the correlation functions obtained from the two detectors overlap perfectly when rescaled taking into account the contrast and baseline. Therefore, it was found that in the glass state far below T g the dynamics have not q dependence within the studied range.</p><p>57 o C 87 o C 117 o C 177 o C</p><p>The study of the dynamics at higher temperatures (in the glass near T g and in the supercooled liquid) was attempted but the decrease in relaxation time reduced the statistics and it was impossible to get the dynamics from the lower angle detector. Therefore, some of the main questions expected to be solved by this experiment were not answered. Considering the increase in intensity expected after the ESRF upgrade, a similar experimental set-up would permit to resolve the microscopic dynamics near T g , and even in a larger q-range, in future experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Zach Evenson / T U München FRM-II Dr. Eloi Pineda / Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Departament de Física Dr. Beatrice Ruta / UCB Lyon 1 -CNRS UMR 5306 Institut Lumiere Matiere</figDesc></figure>
