Abstract At the beamtime we performed in situ and real-time investigation of structure evaluation during growth of small-molecule organic thin films combining X-ray scattering methods with differential reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the visible range. We found strong changes in structural and optical properties upon mixing of donor and acceptor molecules that evidences the formation of the mixed phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental Results</head><p>We co-evaporated two organic small-molecules DIP/PDIF-CN 2 acting as donor-acceptor pair and monitored in real-time the growth of the corresponding mixed crystal varying mixing ratio and temperature of the silicon substrate. We clearly observed the non-symmetric effect of mixing ratio and the strong temperature influence on the structural properties (GIXD scans of resulting films are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Employing GIXD we followed in-situ and in real time the evolution of features belonging to the pristine components as well as the mixed phase (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows real-time GIXD scans measured during film growth). Since upon mixing the DIP and PDIF-CN 2 components form a charge-transfer complex with the new optical spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), we implemented DRS method during the growth in order to establish the correlation between changes in optical properties due to the intermolecular interaction and structural/mixing behaviour. For each film we implemented a set of postgrowth measurements: GIXD and XRR using point detector and reciprocal space maps using PILATUS detector. The quality of the q-maps is good enough to distinguish reflexion from the new mixed phase as well as from the single components (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>

Real time GIXD scans of the equimolar mixed film grown at high substrate temperature. 3. Dialectric constant for a 1:1 mixed film grown at room temperature evaluated from DRS data taken during the growth. 4. Reciprocal space map of a mixed film (1:1, T sub = 400 k), marks represent potential reflections following from the known unit cell parameters (DIP and PDIF-CN 2 ) and the asumed parameters of mixed phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Remarks on quality of measurements</head><p>We found the ID10 beamline particularly suited for our real-time experiments with weakly scattering organic materials. We used two kinds of the detectors (PILATUS 300K and point detector) which allowed obtaining excellent results in the framework of our study. In particular we would like to mention the very good beam stability during the whole beamtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Status and progress of data evaluation</head><p>We aim to include these data in a wider publication concerning charge-transfer interactions in donoracceptor systems, once the dataset is fully analysed.</p><p>We thank Andrey Chumakov and Oleg Konovalov for the valuable support as local contacts during the beamtime.</p></div>		</body>
