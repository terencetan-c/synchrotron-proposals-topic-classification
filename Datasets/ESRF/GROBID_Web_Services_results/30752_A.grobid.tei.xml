<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The use of metal hyperaccumulating higher plants to extract metals accumulated in soils (phytoextraction) might represent a low cost alternative remediation strategy. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for metal tolerance and hyperaccumulation is needed to develop the efficiency of this green technology. This study is the beginning of a National Research Project funded by the CNRS <ref type="bibr">(ECCO, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">(ECCO, -2007))</ref>, aiming at better understanding the mechanisms responsible for Zn and Cd tolerance and accumulation in the hyperaccumulating species Arabidopsis halleri. The purpose of this experiment was to localize Cd in various tissues of A. halleri, to determine its chemical form, and to compare these results to the results obtained on the non hyperaccumulating species Arabidopsis thaliana, previously investigated (experimental report SC1465). During this experiment, we also checked the influence of sample preparation and conditions of analysis (hydrated sample analyzed using a cryostat vs freeze-dried sample or thin section analyzed at ambiant temperature), which appears as a more and more sensitive point in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>A. thaliana and A. halleri were grown on Cd contaminated medium in controlled conditions. Leaves and roots were collected and immersed in N 2 liquid. Some of the samples were freeze-dried, and others were kept in N 2 liquid. Others were embedded in a cryogenic protective compound (O.C.T.), immersed in N 2 liquid and prepared as 30 µm-thick thin sections using a cryomicrotome. Thin sections and freeze-dried samples were analyzed under vacuum at ambiant temperature. Hydrated samples kept in N 2 liquid were analyzed under vacuum at -160°C using a N 2 cryostat available on ID21 beamline.</p><p>Elemental maps were collected for P, S, Cd, K, and Ca by recording the X-ray fluorescence with a Ge solid state detector (PGT). Because most of the samples contain a large amount of potassium, the K K α (3.31 keV) overlaps the most intense Cd emission line, Cd L α1 (3.13 keV) and two beam energies were required to map on one hand, P, S, and Cd (3.55 keV), and on the other hand K and Ca (4.10 keV). Samples were scanned with a beam size on the sample of H=0.7 µm x V=0.3 µm. Cd L III -edge (3.538 keV) µ-XANES spectra were collected on points-of-interest selected from the elemental maps. Measurements were performed in fluorescence-yield detection mode using the same Ge-detector. Many XANES spectra were also recorded on Cd reference compounds including mineral and organic, solid and liquid samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>XANES spectra collected on numerous Cd references indicated that Cd L III -edge XANES was very sensitive to Cd ligands. Indeed, this technique enables a clear distinction between S and O/N ligands since O/N ligands induce a peak at 3539.6 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Solution complexes and Cd-pectin, Cd-cellulose and Cdcell wall display poorly structured spectra, and some of them (eg., Cd-malate and Cd-citrate) are hardly distinguishable. On the contrary, mineral Cd references exhibit characteristic spectral features. This is an important result since to our knowledge, XAS at Cd L III -edge was only used in the past by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Pickering et al (1999)</ref> with a non focused beam.</p><p>Microfluorescence maps and µXANES spectra collected on A. thaliana leaves and roots showed that freeze-drying did not significantly change the distribution and chemical form of Cd compared to the hydrated sample. In leaves, Cd was found to be accumulated in a ring of the trunk of the trichome, where the metal is associated to O ligands provided by pectin of the cell wall (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>). In roots, Cd is preferentially located in vascular bundles where it is bound to S-containing groups (probably phytochelatin or metallothionein). A publication reporting these new results and the previous ones on A. thaliana was submitted to Environmental Science and Technology <ref type="bibr">(Isaure et al.)</ref> in early February 2006. The abstract is reported at the end of this report.</p><p>Results obtained on hydrated samples and thin sections of A. halleri indicated that Cd in leaves was mainly found in a ring located in the trichomes as observed for A. thaliana (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). µXANES also showed that Cd was mainly associated to oxygen ligands of cell wall but a significant contribution of S ligands was detected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>. This contribution increased when we probed points located a few micrometers away from the ring. In our next experiments <ref type="bibr">(March 2006)</ref>, mechanisms of Cd sequestration must be clarified in roots and in the tissues of the non hyperaccumulating A. lyrata.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cadmium is a metal of high toxicity for plants. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was exposed under controlled conditions to 200 µM Cd during 4 days. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX) and micro X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) were used to determine the cadmium distribution in the roots and in the leaves, while Cd L III -edge micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (µ-XANES) spectroscopy was applied to identify the chemical form of the metal. Leaves and roots contained up to 550 mg Cd kg -1 dry weight (DW) and 2530 mg Cd kg -1 DW, respectively. Our results show that, in the roots, Cd is localized in vascular bundles, and coordinated to S ligands. This chemical form is likely to correspond to an intracellular storage of Cd, and possibly to the form of transport from the roots to the leaves. In the leaves, the trichomes represent the main compartment of Cd accumulation, where the metal is bound to pectin-type O ligands of the cell wall. This work highlights the role of trichomes in Cd detoxification and illustrates the sensitivity of Cd L III XANES spectroscopy, which is applied here for the first time to plants. Combined with µ-XRF, Cd L III µ-XANES is very promising to study Cd storage and trafficking mechanisms in plants.</p></div>			</div>
