<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental setup -Details in the previous report (SC4531).</p><p>Results -We succeeded to induce for the first time homogeneous nucleation of ice within the bulk water drop in the volume element defined by the spatial intersection of two orthogonal laser beams with polarizations that are orthogonal and parallel within the horizontal plane and observed its diffraction signal with Pink X-ray beam as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In these X-ray images sets of symmetry related diffraction peaks were identified. This allowed us (i) to determine the absolute orientation of the nuclei in this early stage of growth; (ii) to identify an unambiguous correlation between the directions and symmetry of the laser fields and that of the H-bonding arrays of the induced ice crystals, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2;</ref> (iii) to identify from the evolution of the symmetryrelated diffraction peaks a particle attachment mchanism during the crystal growththe broad peaks became narrower and more intense, a process that was accompanied by peak disappearance (not shown due to space restriction). Finally, the freezing temperatures under the pulsed laser illumination were significantly higher than in dark conditions, upto 12.4 ºC, depending on the laser beam configuration and intensity. A detailed description of the experiment, results, analysis and discussion appears in the manuscript we recently submitted to J. Chem. Phys.</p><p>We also probed the laser-induced ice nucleation with the multi-layer (ML) pulsed X-ray beam.</p><p>However, the X-ray images (not shown) reaveled diffraction peaks that were much intense and spread over a smaller area on the detctor image relative to the images acquired with the Pink X-ray beam -indicating that frezing was rather detected at a later stage. Moreover, by contrast to the pink-beam images, here we could not determine whether the diffraction signal emerged from the volume element defined by the intersecting laser beams.</p><p>We faced several technical problems that effectively reduced our beamtime: adjusting the mirrors within the laser box; small range (12 mm) of motorized stages; and beamtime had fallen.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). (c) Diffraction after illumination by a circularly polarized pulse from the side of the water drop. To substantiate presence of diffraction peaks magnified images thereof are displayed in insets above their azimuth-integrated radial profiles; whereas below them, magnified diffraction peaks appear more intense being measured 700 ms after their first appearance. In the insets, the azimuthal angular spread values  are indicated. The diffraction peaks 1 to 3 in each panel belong to an assemblage of similarly oriented ice crystals; symbols , ,  attached to peaks with the same number denote they are symmetry-related; the orientations of their diffraction vectors are displayed in the bottom row as well as the E-laser fields and incident X-ray beam.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The oriented ice crystal structures and corresponding laser electric fields. The super-and unit-cell structures of the oriented ice crystals, viewed perpendicular to the corresponding laser-induced (hkil) planes. These planes are approximately parallel to that defined by the linearly polarized E1 and E2 vectors (parallel to the glass slide) for panels (a) and (b), and perpendicular to the circularly polarized E2 beam for panel (c). The water units appear as tetrahedra since the crystal structure of IH is proton-disordered 16 (see supplementary material Sec. S1). The pale-blue bars in (a) and (b) indicate directions of primary Hbonding arrays that are parallel to E1 and E2.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1.
