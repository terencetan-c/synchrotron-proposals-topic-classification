<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The structural evolution upon Y-doping from ceria (fluorite, F), to Y 2 O 3 (C-type) was proved to be accompanied by the formation of complex defect structures over different length scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>On the atomic scale, the dopants retain their local environment as in their pure oxide. These aggregates, defined as droplets, average into C-type nanodomains on a larger scale. By increasing the doping amount, the nanodomains are first uncorrelated, then they merge to percolate throughout the crystallite transforming the long range structure from fluorite into C-type. A side effect of this process is the formation of antiphase boundaries domains, as a consequence of the mismatch in the contact of the growing nanodomains.</p><p>Whereas C-type nanodomains are observed through PDF refinements by monitoring the vanishing of the x(M2) parameter, the formation of antiphase boundaries affects the broadening of superstructure peaks only, in the Q-space patterns.</p><p>The goal of the experiment was to follow the evolution of C-type nanodomains from low to high temperature combining Rietveld and Pair Distribution Function.</p><p>The operating wavelength was moved to 0.3144 Å in order to reach high enough Qmax, working just below the Ce-K absorption edge, thus avoiding fluorescence radiation. PDF scans were performed by scanning the 2theta detector over the -4° to 89° range, adding more scans in the high Q range in order to improve the signal to noise ratio. About 3 hrs scans were performed at room temperature, 4 hrs instead was the counting time at T=450°C and 750°C.</p><p>Besides PDF investigations, we acquired Rietveld scans in order to verify the long range structural evolution from RT to 950°C.</p><p>The data analysis was performed describing the doped samples with the C-type setting, where the only structural degree of freedom of cations is the x coordinate of one metal site (M2). In this way, the equilibrium between fluorite and C-type phases can be described by the evolution of the x coordinate of the M2 site: when it equals zero, the structure is fluorite; when it is ≠ than zero, then the structure becomes C-type. This structural change is also reflected by the presence of superstructure peaks, only in the case of C-type structured samples.  This is not just a consequence of Debye Waller. Figure 2 (left) shows the change of the integrated peak intensity of the (413) superstructure reflection, normalized against the (222) peak. From ~400°C on, the relative peak intensity decreases with temperature. The results of Rietveld refinements are reported in Fig 2 (right), where the temperature evolution of the x(M2) is shown. The change in relative intensity of superstructure peaks corresponds to the vanishing of x(M2). The high resolution patterns showed the tendency of C-type samples to transform into fluorite while increasing temperature As a consequence of the intensity decrease, it is hard to monitor the peak broadening evolution as a function of temperature. Nevertheless, insights into the nanoscale structure evolution with temperature can be gained through the Pair Distribution Function. In this respect, the samples with  = 0.34 and 0.38 show no noteworthy changes compared to low temperature, that is with nanodomains in the order of 15 nm. Conversely, the sample with  = 0.31, which showed ~ 10 nm size domains at low temperature, revealed no C-type nanodomains at high temperature. Since the cationic substructure is expected to mirror the oxygen vacancies distribution, these results suggest that up to  ~0.31 at high temperature the oxygen vacancies are more randomly distributed compared to low temperature and to heavier doped samples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (left) and (right) show the temperature evolution of the superstructure peaks for the sample with  = 0.31 and 0.34, respectively.
