<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main aim of the experiments on the oxidation of CO to CO2 on Pt997 near atmospheric pressure was to compare the results with those obtained from Pt977 (SI-2432). Both surfaces are very similar and differ only in the structure of the steps (100 vs 111 for 977 and 997 respectively). Our previous results in the 977 surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> indicated that under reaction conditions the actual surface consisted in 977 and 111 coexisting areas the proportion of which was dependent on the stoichiometry of the gas mixture. The nominal CO/O2 = 2/1 gas proportion was associated to maximum reaction rate and maximum density of monoatomic steps . Departure of these conditions diminished the rate of production of CO2 and the density of monatomic steps at the expenses of an increase of 111 facet areas. The 997 surface behaves completely differently. We observed that in a stoichiometic gas mixture, upon increasing the sample temperature the reaction rate increased steadily until ca. 220 Â°C where a clear sudden jump on the reactivity occurred that was associated to a transition from single to double steps. Lowering the temperature caused single steps to appear again at the expenses of the double steps. The jump in reactivity was also accompanied by the formation of 111 surface facets (as in the 977 surface) which degraded the reversibility of the single/double step transition. However, it was found out that by diluting the CO and O2 reactants in Ar while keeping the total pressure invariant, the 111 faceting was completely eliminated and a good reversibility single/double steps occurred. Under these conditions the reaction rate exhibited a clear and marked jump directly correlated to the transformation from single to double stepped surface. Lowering the temperature reverted to low reactivity and single steps. We consider this as an outstanding result since it clearly demonstrates that higher reactivity is associated to double steps and lower reactivity to single steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We investigated the oxidation of CO on Pt(997). The crystal was mounted in the flow reactor of ID3 that was installed in the diffractometer in EH1. The surface was initially prepared with standard UHV methods. At room temperature the reaction rate was below our detection limit. At T=90-100C, CO2 production was clearly detected with a gas analyser. The central result is that whereas the mixture of CO and O2 did not cause any change in the surface morphology when the reaction did not proceed (between room temperature and ~100 C), it originated an increase of the surface density of monoatomic steps and a decrease of the (111) facets when CO2 was produced. More important, the step generation and (111) facet reduction occurred optimally only when the proportion of the reactants was close to the stoichiometric 2:1 CO/O2 ratio.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (left side) illustrates the single step/double step transition observed in Pt997 under reaction conditions in aAr rich gas mixture (total gas pressure 200 mbar). The black curve is a H scan (perpendicular to thedirection of the steps) which exhibits peaks at H= 25 and 27 characteristic of equally spaced single steps separated by terraces of 8 atoms in width. The red curve has the main peak at H=26 which arises from the doubling of the dimensions of the terraces that results from the formation of double steps although a small peak at H=27 from monoatomic steps still remains. The inset of the figure shows in red the temporal evolution of the intensity of the double height step peak while the sample temperature was being increased with the ceramic heater and the transformation single to double atomic height steps was occurring (the black H scan evolved to the red one) . The sudden and rapid increase of the intensity is a consequence of a exponential dependence of the rate of formation of double steps with a time constant of few seconds. The sample temperature depicted in black exhibits two approximately linear regimes (marked with blue dashed lines) which correspond to the linear temporal increase of the current of the sample heater. However, between t =50 and 60 seconds the sample temperature has a jump which coincides with the formation of the double steps. The rate of increase of the sample temperature is about 6 times larger during the transition than before or after and it is in fact a fingerprint of the reaction rate as depicted in the right side of figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Again, in red the intensity of the double steps are displayed and in blue the signal of CO2 measured with the mass spectrometer while the temperature is first increased (bottom branch of the loop) , then lowered (top branch of the loop) . The transformation double/single steps is reversible with hysteresis and it was observed many times.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,41.28,433.92,526.80,209.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
