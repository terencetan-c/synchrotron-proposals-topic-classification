<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Solid state batteries (main experiment) X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT) and absorption contrast X-ray computed tomography (XCT) were measured on solid-state Li-ion batteries in discharged and charged states. The compared conditions were: solid-state electrolyte (baseline Li6PS5Cl [LPSC] vs modified LPSC) and cathode (baseline transition metal oxide [TMO] cathode vs coated-TMO). Specific chemistries and 2θ values have been omitted until publication. XRD-CT measurements provided for spatially resolved determination of parasitic reaction products, heterogeneous lithiation of the cathode particles, and other quantities (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The shift in 2θ of one of the cathode peaks, used as a proxy for lithiation of the cathode, was found to be quite heterogeneous depending on factors such as: cathode particle aggregation, overall state-of-charge of the battery, solidelectrolyte used, and coated vs uncoated cathode (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Data analysis, segmentation, and interpretation is still ongoing. We anticipate the results to inform design rules for future development of low pressure, high-energy density all-solid-state batteries for  applications including electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. We expect to publish these results within 8 months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Co-free cathodes (preliminary data)</head><p>XRD-CT and XCT were performed on ex situ chunks of Co-free, Li-and Mnrich (LMR) cathodes in both the pristine state and after a high-voltage activation induces an irreversible phase change in the material. These data were collected during the allotted time for proposal MA5627. The results show the ability to clearly distinguish the pre-and postactivation phases in this cathode and offer the potential to distinguish nonactivated regions within the cathode bulk by fitting the peak centers at each voxel to known peaks for both phases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) . With these data, we can correlate crystallographic and microstructural features to battery performance to help inform and guide the design of optimized Li-ion batteries. This analysis will help pave the way towards abundant and locally sourced Co-free Li-ion batteries for future electric vehicle implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lead pipe corrosion control treatments (preliminary data)</head><p>XRD-CT and XCT were collected for one sample of lead pipe scales during the allotted time for proposal MA5627 to determine the efficacy of using these imaging techniques for pipe scale analysis. Results show that the methods can distinguish between different phases (e.g. hydrocerrusite, lead, quartz) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and should provide an accurate 3D reconstruction of the heterogeneous pipe scales. Pipe scales are materials that form coatings on the inside of pipes as chemical compounds and minerals in water react with corroding pipes. The purpose of the scales is to passivate the surface of the pipe wall. These results will inform the nature of lead pipe scales by providing insight into the morphology and mineralogy and the mechanisms of scale formation which to our knowledge has not been studied with these methods. Traditional pipe scale analysis techniques fail to provide a 3D resolved microstructural analysis and involve labor intensive sample preparation as well as subsampling errors.  <ref type="formula">015</ref>) XRD peak shifts to lower q after activation (left) due to repulsive Coulombic forces between anion layers in the crystal structure.
