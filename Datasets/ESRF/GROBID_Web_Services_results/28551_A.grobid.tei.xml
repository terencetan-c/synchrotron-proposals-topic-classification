<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>In synovial joints the bone is covered by a thin layer of articular cartilage that provides a low-friction bearing surface and acts as a shock-absorber. The main structural element of cartilage is a highly organised network of Type II collagen fibres, maintained in tension by an osmotic, or swelling, pressure generated by a viscoelastic gel of highly anionic proteoglycans that fills the voids in the collagen network. The collagen fibres run parallel to the articular surface in the superficial layer of cartilage, are isotropically oriented in the mid zone and, in the deep zone overlying the bone, run perpendicular to the interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Stockwell 1979)</ref>.</p><p>The interface between cartilage and bone comprises a zone of calcified cartilage bounded above by the tide mark and below by the cement line. The micro-structural organisation of the zone of calcified cartilage is believed to be similar to that of cartilage with Type II collagen fibrils arranged predominantly perpendicular to the articular surface except that it is mineralized. The mineral comprises mainly of calcium apatite, but its organisation and relationship to collagen fibres have only recently been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Zizak et al 2003)</ref>. This layer is believed to be a mechanically important interface in matching the disparate properties of bone and cartilage. Hence, or otherwise, it may be a key element in the development of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis and, indeed, may explain the inverse correlation in the incidence of these conditions.</p><p>The aims of our research were first to explore the potential of microbeam SAXS and WAXS to further chacterise the structure of the interface in diseased tissue and second to establish whether these techniques can be used to quantify structural changes associated with the application of mechanical loads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>A cross section of bone and articular cartilage, cut longitudinally and approximately 1mm thick, was taken from the metacarpalphalangal joint of the horse. This was done immediately post mortem from a horse undergoing euthanasia. WAXS and SAXS diffraction patterns were obtained at 15 equally spaced depth increments of 67µm passing from the cartilage surface through the calcified cartilage into the bone to a maximum depth of 1mm both in normal tissue and through a lesion. Loads were then applied to the cartilage surface using a custom built press and diffraction patterns were again obtained at increasing depths through the sample. Additional samples that had been decalcified were also studied. This was to allow clear identification of the d-spacings assigned to collagen and crystal components from which the bone and cartilage consists.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The experiments provided a rich body of data and a PhD student has been engaged in the study who is now completeing the analysis. WAXS diffraction patterns have been analysed using fit2D and, by observing the d-spacings found in cartilage and bone of the decalcified sample comparing to the calcified sample, attribution was made of the d-spacings associated with the collagen and crystal as shown in table 1 below. The three main regions, bone, interface and cartilage could then be identified by looking at the d-spacings found in the scan.</p><p>Crystal d-spacings (Å) Collagen d-spacings (Å) 1.8 2.8 3.4 3.1 3.8 3.2 5.2 2.3 8.2 6.2 Table 1: D-spacings associated with collagen and mineral (calium apatite).</p><p>Firstly, an analysis was made of how the orientation of the components changes in bone, calacifed cartilage and cartilage. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illlustrates a significant change in orentation of the [100] plane of calcium apatite from bone to the interface region and figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates a change in orientation of collagen (d=6.2Å) from calcified cartilage to cartilage.</p><p>When the sample was loaded significant changes were observed on the WAX and SAX diffraction patterns with regard to orientation, intensity and width of bands at all depths in the specimen. The intensity of the rings on the diffraction patterns, particularly d=3.2Å and d=2.8Å for the interface region, decreased with load and they became more highly oriented as shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The quantitive analysis of these results is currently in hand but a preliminary anaylsis indicates changes in orientation with load propagate deep into the tissue.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>Although the data analysis from this rich data set is still to be completed, it is clear that new insights into the structure of both the normal and diseased interface region are emerging. In addition, we have detected changes with load, propagating deep into the tissue. Characterisation of the time-course of these changes would greatly advance understanding of tissue mechanics and warrants further investigation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The change in orentation of the [100] plane of calcium apatite with depth into the sample</figDesc></figure>
