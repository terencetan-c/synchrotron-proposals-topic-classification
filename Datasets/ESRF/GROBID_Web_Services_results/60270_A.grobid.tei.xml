<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Our original experiment consisted of photo-electro-chemical surface science of anatase TiO 2 (101) where we planned to prepare anatase TiO 2 (101) samples in utra-high vacuum (UHV) and use our custom built photo-electro-chemical droplet cell for the photo-electro-chemical measurements. At ID03, it was possible to prepare our samples in UHV, however, the ID03 UHV set up was not compatible with our droplet cell set up rendering it impossible to transfer our sample from the ID03 UHV set up to our droplet cell under UHV conditions. For this purpose, we changed our sample from UHV prepared anatase TiO 2 (101) to 'in-air' prepared Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110). Additionally, we encountered shipping problems from the UK to France which resulted in our droplet cell being misplaced by the shipping company -our cell arrived mid-way through our beamtime. Due to this, we decided to use an electrochemical Myler cell (at ID03) for our experiment to allow us to take electro-chemical measurements of the Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110) surface.</p><p>We used ID03's Myler cell to understand the Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110) interface with 0.1 M NaOH and the evolution of the surface under electrochemical control. During our experiment, we encountered a number of problems with the Myler cell. This was the first time that our group used the Myler cell and we needed to explore the different geometries (thick film, midfilm, thin film etc) in which to acquire the data. During our initial attempts at using the cell we encoutered a number of problems such as 'liquid leaks' in the cell and sample stage movement which we negotiated and optimised. The Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110) crystals were prepared in the UK and bought to the ESRF, the surface quality was checked with LEED and the surfaces were UV/Ozone treated before the experiment to remove adventigious carbon. We firstly measured our Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110) in an N 2 environment. We were able to collect 8 crystal truncation rods (CTRs) of the surface under an N 2 environment. This data is currerntly in the process of being analysed. Subsequently, we introduced 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte into the Myler cell to probe the Nbdoped rutile TiO 2 (110) and 0.1 M NaOH interface. Initally we set up the Myler cell such that the surface had ~2 mm (thick film geometry) of electrolyte over it (i.e surface to Myler distance was ~2 mm). Under these conditions, the back ground (associated with the electrolyte) was masking the CTR intensity making it difficult to obtain the necessary results. We subsequenlty kept reducing the surface to Myler distance until the Myler film was lying on top of the sample (thin film geomtery) with the Myler to sample distance expected to be on the µm scale. Under these conditions we collected 5 CTRs. However, during the 'thinfilm' geometry measurements the electrolyte associated background continued to mask the CTR intensity. Our attempts at electrochemistry were laregly hampred by beam loss and electrolyte associated background staurating the detectors.</p></div>			</div>
