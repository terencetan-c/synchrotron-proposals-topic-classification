<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>allows to increase the performance of circuits without going through the miniaturization of components and the features diversification using heterogeneous integration. A major benefit is the significant cut in the energy consumption through the replacement of long horizontal connections by shorter vertical connections.</p><p>Nevertheless, this architecture induces extreme thermomechanical stresses during the manufacturing process which can generate damages in several layers of the assembly. Recycling defective CdHgTe based infrared detectors containing heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium is complex and detrimental to the environment. A particularity of these components is the working temperature of 77K which is critical for the reliability of the electronic assembly and amplifies several failure modes as the detection circuit warpage or solder bump crack. In order to understand these defects, several strain/stress analyses have been carried out at room temperature (293K) and cryogenic temperature (77K) using laboratory X-ray diffraction. This assembly consists of three layers presented Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: a single crystal of CdHgTe composed of a 30µm width pixel matrix, a polycrystalline interconnexion layer constituted of an indium solder field underfilled with amorphous epoxy and a single crystal silicon substrate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 CdHgTe based IR detector structure</head><p>A specific method available for single crystal analysis has been optimised for such multilayers architecture using a laboratory four circle diffractometer to obtain the stress values in the CdHgTe layer and in the below silicon substrate. Nevertheless, the available energy in laboratory don't allow the simultaneously analysis of the CdHgTe detection circuit and the silicon substrate. And then, this technic allows a millimetric resolution which don't allow the pixel to pixel study of the CdHgTe detection circuit at a micrometric scale. So the aim of the experimental campaign on BM32 was to map some pixel of the CdHgTe circuit with a high energy microbeam in order to get for each point simultaneously a Laue pattern of CdHgTe, and Si to obtain strain value the both layers at room temperature and close to -196°C (running temperature of the detector) at a micrometric scale. Indeed, we expected that the strains/stresses were increased at low temperature due to heterogeneous thermal expansion and dilatation of the different materials. We proposed to realise Laue microdiffraction at several location of the assembly (centre and corner of the CdHgTe detection circuit) coupled with XRF technique to localise solders on the assembly in order to link stress mapping with the geometry below the CdHgTe detection circuit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2 Diffraction patterns of the structure and experimental set up on the BM32 beamline</head><p>The sample is fixed on a copper part cooled with an internal constant liquid nitrogen flow. A half-sphere partially transparent to X-rays above the sample and a vacuum circuit protects the system against ice forming. This geometry allowed an optimal accessibility of the incident/diffracted beam. So ambient and cryogenic microLaue mappings have been conducted in both CdHgTe and silicon in different zones in order to observe the thermal strain gradient, calculate the strain/stress and compared to the FEM model previously developed. X-ray fluorescence of the sample is also analysed with a specific detector available on the beamline. A focused white beam, 5 to 19keV and 0,7µm x 0,7µm, was used.</p></div>
