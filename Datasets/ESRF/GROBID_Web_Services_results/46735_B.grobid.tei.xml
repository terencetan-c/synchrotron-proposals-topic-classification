<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was the observation of surface steps from constructive/destructive interferences between the amplitudes scattered by various terraces. This needs a careful observation of the intensity variations in the vicinity of the "antibragg" (AB) positions, specifically here the (1/2 1/2 1/2) position of the ( G = (111)) crystal truncation rod (CTR) for a <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref> vicinal surface copper crystal.</p><p>For the observation of surface defects in the vicinity of the AB position, the crystal irradiated by the coherent X-ray beam must be free from structure defects like dislocations, subgrain boundaries. As the beamsize was close to 10µm, a careful sample annealing had to be carried out. After a few hours in the 720-750C temperature range, regions of high crystalline quality were obtained, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.  Our sample was vicinal with a small miscut angle (&lt; 0.1 • ), and after annealing, step bunching produced essentially flat terraces with a small amount of steps of height of the order of 10 nm, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. This could be checked from the small number of speckles observed for x&lt; 0.3 in our diffraction figures.</p><p>In this experiment, low intensity in the AB region (2-3 x-rays/s at the AB position above a flat background) made surface dynamics study difficult. As some hundreds of seconds were necessary to obtain a significant statistics, the surface fluctuations were too fast to be observed at 700C. Improvements in beam intensity can be obtained if the focussing KB mirrors provide a smaller spot and if the beamsize can be better optimized. This needs to carefully measure the beam dimensiuons at the sample, and we think that large significant improvements can be obtained.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The Bragg peak width (left figure) is 0.008 • , close to the Darwin width of copper (0.006 • ) and a single peak (middle) is observed for the (0.85 0.085 0.85) position, showing the absence of crystal defects.
