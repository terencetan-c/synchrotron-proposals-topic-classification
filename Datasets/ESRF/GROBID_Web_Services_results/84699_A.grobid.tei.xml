<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>1. Background and motivation Porphyrins are widely studied functional dyes that can coordinate a great variety of metal cations. In biological systems, porphyrins play essential roles as photosynthetic antenna and reaction center. In our research we use porphyrin derivatives for various sensing applications such as enantiopurity sensing, selective detection of anions. Most of these sensing features are realized by non-covalent interactions (H-bond, electrostatic, -, etc.) between porphyrin and substrate. The sensing is unfortunately permitted only in organic solvents (CHCl3, THF, etc.). Therefore, we have introduced water soluble moieties such as mtetraethylene glycol (mTEG) or poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) at the periphery of porphyrin (TPP) functional unit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). These porphyrin/polymer systems exhibit response to whole range of stimuli (temperature, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>; pH, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>; solvent composition; etc.) and are potential candidates for various sensing applications, detection, separation and imaging purposes in aqueous media. In addition, these compounds can be also used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) or for heterogeneous catalysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p>SAXS experiments were performed on the beamline BM29 BIOSAXS using a pixel detector (Pilatus 1M). The X-ray scattering images were recorded at a sample-detector distance 2.867 m, using a monochromatic incident X-ray beam with an energy E = 12,5 keV, covering the range of momentum transfer of 0.025 nm -1 &lt; q &lt; 5 nm -1 (q =4π sin θ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). The solvent (deuterated water) scattering was subtracted prior to the fitting analysis. All data manipulations were performed using SASfit software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>We have examined size and shape of TPP-polymer water-soluble molecules which are thermo-and pHresponsive. Experiments were performed in a broad range concentrations and temperatures in order to cover the phase separation phenomenon of various types of TPP derivatives. As an acid we have used (S)camphorsulfonic acid, (S)-CSA. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> shows the scattering intensities for TPP-PNIPAm(long) [22.7 kDa, LCST = 27 °C]. Also scattering data in the presence of (S)-CSA acid are shown (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</p><p>A fitting model of polydisperse ellipsoids (PELs) was chosen for samples at low temperatures (below phase separation). At higher temperatures (from 35 °C) polydisperse spheres (PSs) were found in the solution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). The effect of addition of acid ((S)-CSA) into the solution increases the size of PSs above phase separation temperature (i.e. 55 °C) almost twice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>Based on these preliminary findings we could make a model of phase separation as seen schematically in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. There are several new and unusual effects of these studied systems: (1) the phase separation temperature is almost unchanged after addition of acid (i.e. at low pH) and (2) the size of spherical aggregates is about twice larger above separation when acid is added (which is counterintuitive since one would expect opposite due to electrostatic repulsion of charged TPP cores). These effects build the link between intrinsic structure of TPP derivatives in various conditions which can be exploited for fabrication of nano-/micro-gels with intended dimensions and subsequently use them, for example, as a drug delivery systems or photodynamic sensitizers. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Jan Labuta*, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, Japan Sergey Filippov*, Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry (IMC) of the Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Rep.
