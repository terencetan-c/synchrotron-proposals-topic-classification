<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SC 5197 was performed on the nanobranch of ID13 with a beam cross-section of (70x70) nm² at an energy of 13 keV with exposure times usually 40 ms per point. The goal of the experiment was to perform high-real-space resolution (sub-micron scale) XRF/XRD mapping of tactile hair sensilla of the spider Cupiennius salei to study the chitin-protein structure and composition of these mechanosensors. To study structure along the curved hair shaft the beam line scientist developed a fibre-tracking macro, which allowed us to acquire the data in a semi-automated manner. Starting from the socket of the sensilla, maps were acquired moving along the hair shaft with a defined spacing. Also, we are very grateful for the additional measurement time, which together with the efficient scanning procedure enabled us to measure further sample environment for our follow up experiment SC 5329.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To study the chitin-protein architecture of the tactile hair sensilla individual tactile hair from the tarsus of C. salei were dissected with the cuticle embedding the socket of the sensillum. To assure reproducibility only the two longest tactile hairs, which can be found on every tarsus of a sub-adult and adult C. salei, were used (red arrowheads Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). The cuticle sections were cut manually to a thickness of less than 50 µm but with a length of up to 1 mm. The samples were glued away from the region of interest (ROI) to silicon nitride membranes (1 µm thickness) to provide a mechanical support without compromising signal/noise and increasing background signal (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</p><p>To detect the typical chitin-protein fibre diffractions we measured at a q range ranging from 0.1 to 40 nm -1 . We determined the optimal exposure time and step size, which enabled us to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio while reducing the radiation damage of the sample. Herein, the challenge was the decreasing diameter of the hair towards the tip, however, with 40 ms the diffraction pattern still showed signal of the chitinprotein fibres (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 f</ref>,<ref type="figure">g</ref>). Fig 2 a-c depicts representative WAXS intensity maps of different region of the hair, the hairs socket, shaft and tip, respectively. The high-resolution maps of the WAXS intensity of the regions of the socket and hair shaft reveal details as the membrane suspending the hair or the hollow region within the shaft and its asymmetric structure. While the signal-to-noise ratio becomes worse towards the tip, averaging is done to improve the signal quality. The goal is to quantify chitin/protein ratio, the chitin fibre orientation and compare it between the different regions along the hair. For that, the diffraction patterns are integrated and background subtracted. Then the resulting profiles will be exported for peak fitting in a customized tool developed in our group.</p><p>Besides, we detected the XRF, which due to the small beam size, provide us with high resolutions maps of different naturally occurring halogen and metal ions. We observed diverse distribution of elements, while for instance manganese was distributed homogenously (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) zinc was found predominantly at the convex side of the tactile hair shaft. Also, at the base of the sensillum we found that the socket and the membrane suspending the tactile hair were richer in zinc compared to the surrounding tissue. However, as only intact tactile hairs were studied the distribution across the hair shaft, as variation from the centre to the periphery could not be seen.</p><p>Due to the generous extension of the experiment time, we were able to measure additional samples besides the ones initially planned. With regard to the follow up experiment SC 5329 we tested high-resolution SAX/WAXS mapping of fully hydrated hair sensilla as well as C. salei. of pad long sections, tibia long section, diatom biofilms and weevil scales. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Dresden, Center for Molecular Bioengineering B CUBE, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden -DE 2) Laboratory MPI of Colloids &amp; Interface Department of Biomaterials Wissenschaftspark Golm, 14424 POTSDAM -DE</figDesc></figure>
