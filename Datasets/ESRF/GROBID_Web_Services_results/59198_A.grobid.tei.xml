<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The electronic state of noble-metal co-catalysts on semiconductor photoabsorbers relevant for photocatalytic H2 generation via either overall water splitting (2H2O→2H2+O2) or photoreforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons (e.g., CH3OH+H2O→CO2+3H2) was investigated by means of in situ XANES measurements in liquid reaction media. XAFS measurements were performed on Rh-, Pt-and Pd-decorated TiO2 (1 wt.% noble metal loading) photocatalysts for photoreforming and on Rh-and Pt-decorated SrTiO3 semiconductors (0.1-1 wt.% noble metal loading), which are active in anodic O2-evolution from water, and thus enable photocatalytic overall water splitting. In addition, a Rh-decorated SrTiO3 co-modified with a hydrated CrOxshell was examined. The latter is mandatory to achieve water splitting as it acts as a molecular sieve under reaction conditions preventing O2-adsorption and back-reaction to water (H2+½O2→H2O). Preventing the back reaction enables efficient H2-generation from water in absence of sacrificial agents. The results obtained at ESRF ID26 demonstrate that noble metals, independently of the as-prepared state, reduce in situ to the metallic state, which constitutes the active state under H2-evolution conditions. In pure H2O and in the absence of illumination, the co-catalysts remain mainly oxidized due to air exposure after preparation. We could show that upon band gap irradiation, reduction to the metals occurs in situ in pure water. In contrast, under photoreforming conditions (in the presence of aqueous glycerol or methanol) we encountered reduction to the metals already under dark conditions in the presence of the oxygenate indicating that the latter acted as a reducing agent to the co-catalysts at ambient conditions. The combination of low co-catalysts loadings (0.1 wt.% Rh) and strongly competing Sr-fluorescence at the Rh K-edge excitation energies did not allow for examination of the Rhdecorated SrTiO3 samples. It is planned to complete these investigations in the future. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of the co-catalyst on the photocatalytic activity of solid semiconductors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B) Potential publication</head><p>During a preliminary experimental run at ESRF BM25 we were able to acquire a first dataset characterizing Rh/TiO2 and Rh/GaN:ZnO photocatalysts ex situ. We published this data in the context of a kinetic/mechanistic investigation of photoreforming (T.F. Berto, K.E. Sanwald, W. Eisenreich, O.Y. Gutiérrez, J.A. Lercher, J. <ref type="bibr">Catal. 338 (2016)</ref>). The spectra obtained at ESRF ID26 are fully evaluated and analyzed and will be included in further manuscripts that are currently in preparation. Therein, the in situ XANES measurements are indispensable in understanding the impact of the co-catalysts in relation to the kinetic experiments performed at our home institution. Further oral contributions to international conferences are planned and in preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C) Experimental results</head><p>We discuss the electronic state of the noble metal (Rh, Pd, Pt) co-catalyst decorating TiO2. The metal nanoparticles (typically 1 wt.% of metal) were loaded on TiO2 via incipient wetness impregnation of a precursor solution followed by thermal treatments in synthetic air and H2. The resulting materials were examined by a series of standard techniques available at Technische Universität München (XRD, TEM, N2 and H2 sorption). Exemplarily, spectra at the Rh K-edge recorded under dry (asprepared and after thermal reduction in H2 at 250 °C) and liquidphase conditions (ambient, anaerobic environment) relevant to photocatalytic H2-generation are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Reference spectra are shown for comparison (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (A)). Rh existed predominantly in its oxidic state in the dry catalyst, as deduced from the similarity of the catalyst to the spectrum of Rh2O3. This is likely due to re-oxidation of the nanoparticles upon exposure to air after preparation. As a further reference, complete reduction to the metal may be achieved upon treatment in H2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (B)</ref>). Rh in the as-prepared photocatalyst retained its oxidic nature upon immersion in liquid H2O. However, upon irradiation with UV-Vis illumination for about 30 minutes, the transformation to metallic Rh was readily observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (C)</ref>). This shows that metal is the photocatalytically active state. As the H2-evolution activities of TiO2-based photocatalysts in pure H2O (in the absence of oxygenated hydrocarbons) are very poor, the reduction of Rh oxide species upon illumination indicates that cocatalyst reduction originates directly from photogenerated electrons rather than from evolved H2. Contrarily, complete reduction of RhOx was observed already before UV-Vis irradiation in presence of glycerol (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(D)</ref>) indicating that the oxygenate acts as reducing agent under these conditions. Similar findings were obtained by application of an aqueous methanol solution or when omitting the H2reduction step during catalyst preparation. In the presence of oxygenated hydrocarbons, XANES remained mainly unchanged after provision of UV-Vis irradiation. Regarding the state of the cocatalyst, equivalent findings were obtained in case of Pt and Pd co-catalysts which demonstrate the generality and validity of the findings for noble metals.  A more complex scenario may arise when the semiconductor is active in water oxidation, e.g. SrTiO3. In this case, evolved O2 or surface oxidizing species have the potential to oxidize the metal. In turn, the performance and role of the co-catalyst might change with the oxidation state. However, in the exemplary case of Pt/SrTiO3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the oxidized state of the cocatalysts (reached during air exposure) fully transforms to metal in the presence of oxygenates or under illumination. Therefore, the activity for water oxidation at the anode did not significantly influence the state of the co-catalyst. We furthermore recorded in situ XANES of a core-shell type RhCrOx/SrTiO3 photocatalyst (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), where the chromia shell was deposited via photoreduction of a Cr(VI) precursor (K2CrO4). Missing the pre-edge feature in the sample spectra clearly provides evidence of the absence of Cr(VI) and formation of an oxidic Cr(III) shell. The state of the latter remained unchanged in different reaction media as well as before/after UV-Vis irradiation. The pronounced differences encountered comparing the XANES of the photocatalyst samples to a dry Cr2O3 reference are attributed to the formation of a hydrated Cr(III)oxyhydroxide (Cr(III)Ox(OH)y • z H2O) which is expected to provide H + -conductivity and H2-diffusivity at the cathode under H2-evolution conditions. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Rh K-edge XANES of 1wt.% RhOx/TiO2 recorded under different conditions.
