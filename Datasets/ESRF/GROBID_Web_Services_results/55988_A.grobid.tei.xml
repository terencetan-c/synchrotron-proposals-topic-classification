<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The proposed study concerns mineral iodate material (NaI 3 O 8 , a promising material for infrared parametric generation),which necessitate accurate analysis of the iodine charge density to be further correlated to NLO properties. Modeling the electron density of inorganic materials containing heavy elements is very far from a routine work: accurate absorption and extinction corrections are the key for a realistic electron density modeling and can only be performed with synchrotron radiation.The main difficulties are -Extinction: extinction coefficient is around 0.5 for (11-1) (111) (201) and (220) reflections for NaI 3 O 8 structure (as refined with MoPro using Ag radiation (0.54 Å) home diffractometer data ). So, to minimize extinction, the wavelength should be short (0.15-0.3 Å).</p><p>-High core/valence number of electrons ratio for the iodine atom (53/7). Normalized valence scattering factors of iodine decrease very quickly versus (sinθ/λ) (Normalized f val iodine is only 0.002e at 0.25 Å -1 ) which therefore requires very accurate low resolution data. This is a real challenge due to extinction. -Iodine presents strong absorption which must be accurately corrected: therefore the choice of the short wavelength limits absorption. Wavelengths around the K absorption edge of iodine (33.17 keV, 0.373 Å) should be avoided.</p><p>As the previous experiment was finished earlier, we started our experiment the previous day at 17:00. So we took advantage of 15 hours additional shift. The experiments were performed on the ID11 beam line, using a two-dimensional CCD detector, at the shortest possible wavelength (0.15815 Ǻ, E= 78.3916 keV) at low temperature (120 K and 30 K) to the highest possible resolution (at sinθ/λ 1.25 Ǻ -1 ) to ensure a proper deconvolution of the electron density from thermal motion.</p><p>Two selected crystals were rounded by controled dissolution to make them almost spherical, to minimize absorption and absorption anisotropy effects: crystal #1 84 &lt; size &lt; 94 µm ; transmission = 90,3 %; crystal #2 67 &lt; size &lt; 99 µm; transmission= 89 to 92% ) . Both were measured at 120 K, and only crystal #1 at 30 K.</p><p>The first calculations, realized during experiments, showed that it was necessary to recalibrate the detector (frelon camera) for later optimal data corrections. Fortunately, our local contact managed to perform this sensitive task not only by obtaining a sample that could be used as standard during our shifts but also by devoting more time after our runs to obtain a good calibration of the detector's pixels. Ultra high resolution data set has been collected at 78.3916 KeV; sin θ / λ = 0.09-1.25 Å -1; d= 0.23-5.73Å; The corrections due to the detector have been performed. Currently, the data analysis is in progress.</p></div>			</div>
