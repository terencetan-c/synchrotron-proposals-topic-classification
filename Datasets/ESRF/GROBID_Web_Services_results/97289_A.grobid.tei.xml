<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anisotropic structure and in situ crystallization of UAuNWs</head><p>To understand the crystalline structure and the growth direction, AuUNWs, synthesized by the reduction of HAuCl4.3H2O by triisopropylsilane (TIPS) in 400 mM OY dissolved hexane solution, were aligned by applying 40 kHz AC voltage (250 V/mm). Strongly anisotropic patterns were recorded in agreement with previous SAXS data. Intensity was integrated horizontally (angle range = -179, -149°) i.e. in the direction parallel to the electric field and vertically (angle range = -121, -91) i.e. perpendicular to the electric. The resulting atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) of AuUNWs parallel and perpendicular to the applied ac electric field -are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The correlation length measured perpendicular to the electric field is consistent with the diameter of the wires. On the other hand, an extended coherence length is observed in the parallel direction. This preliminary result indicates that the Au UNWs are aligned and that they present a good crystallinity in their long axis. The position and intensity of correlation peaks do not fit with a FCC model. The next step will be to generate PDF of anisotropic crystal with different structures to describe precisely the structure and the crystallographic orientation of the Au UNWs. TXS of Au UNWs grown under ac electric field and outside the field have been recorded as well as Au UNWs grown with different surface ligands. This will allow to show the influence of both parameters on the UNWs unusual structure.</p><p>Synthesis of ultra-thin nanowires carried out under electric field was followed using TXS. Time-resolved atomic PDFs during the crystallization of AuUNWs, along with the precursor solution: 400 mM OY (0 h), are show in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. Initially, at t = 0 h, the first Au-Au correlation peak in PNCs are weak and positioned at a far distance. As reaction proceeds, this correlation distance shrinks, along with the emergence of long-distance peaks, during the crystallization process. This result suggests that the AuUNWs have emerged through noncrystalline PNCs. Precursors structures TXS of precursor solutions were recorded -as a function of OY concentration -using a static sample holder. The extracted PDFs of precursor solutions are shown in Fig. 2. The variation in intensity and position of correlation peaks demonstrate that the local environment around Au, in the precursors solutions, modifies as a function of OY concentration, the main peak at 2.25 Å (Au-Cl distance) being progressively replaced by a peak at 2.04 Å (Au-N distance) with increasing [OY]. Irrespective of the OY concentration, a peak at 3.1 Å corresponding to Au-Au aurophilic bond is observed.</p><p>As we know from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), the precursor solutions contain nanostructured objects. In the following, these objects will be called prenucleation clusters (PNCs). Irrespective of the OY concentration, the structural correlation length in r-space is found to be ≤ 5 Å which is contrary to the mean size of scattering objects as observed by SAXS (ca. 43 Å). This difference indicates that the nanostructured objects recorded using TXS are non-crystalline in nature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In situ crystallization and phase transformation of UIAuNSs</head><p>In situ crystallization of ultra-small gold nanoparticles (in presence of 50 mM OY in hexane) was followed using TXS. The time-resolved atomic PDFs during the crystallization process of UIAuNSs, along with the precursor solution containing PNCs: 50 mM OY, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>. The Au-Au correlation peak at 3.1 Å in the PNCs (t= 0) shifts to 2.86 Å when the nucleation of the metal particle takes place, i.e. before 3 min. At 3 min, the structural correlation is identified only until ~ 10 Å (possibly nuclei for further growth). Then, an increasing correlation length is observed with time corresponding to metal particle growth. The structure of the final particles is not the fcc structure of bulk but reminds an icosahedral structure. These results inidcated that nanoparticles with an icosahedral structure and a mean size of ca. 20 Å are produced from non-crystalline prenucleation clusters (average size of about 43 Å: from SAXS). Additional TXS have recorded between 0 and 3 min. Their analysis should provide a complete picture of the nucleation and growth of the 2 nm particles with a temporal resolution on the second scale and a spatial resolution on the Å scale. These synthesized nanoparticles were aged (at 95 °C for 26 h and 48 h) and recorded using TXS. The resulted experimental PDFs, along with the PDFs of Au ultra-small icosahedra and Au decahedra used as reference are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>. As can be seen, aging resulted in an increase in the size of Au nanospheres along with the modification in its crystalline structure that becomes closer to the structure of decahedra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). Further analysis and modelling should allow us to have a complete description of the recrytsallization process of Au icosahedra to decahedra.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future perspective:</head><p>In continuation, modelling are now needed to go further in the structural analysis of ultrathin nanowires using high quality experimental data set recorded on ID15A. The initial structure of PNCs will be identified by molecular dynamics. Then, the time-resolved atomic PDFs will be modeled by reverse Monte-Carlo simulation to propose the crystallization mechanism of ultra-thin nanowires and ultra-small nanospheres.</p><p>(a) (b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
