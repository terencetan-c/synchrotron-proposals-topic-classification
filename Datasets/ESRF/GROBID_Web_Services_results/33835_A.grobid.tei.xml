<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Glassy mixture of chalcogenides and Ag halides behaves as a superionic conductor even at room temperature. Thus it has received much attention due to the fundamental interest on the conduction mechanism as well as the application to solid-state electrochemical devices. Even though crystal AgBr does not have a superionic phase at any temperatures, a room-temperature superionic phenomena appear in AgBrdoped As 2 Se 3 systems similar to AgI-doped As 2 Se 3 mixtures. Onodera et al. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> have measured electrical conductivity, density, and differential thermal analysis. As in glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 1-x (AgI) x mixtures [2], (As 2 Se 3 ) 1-x (AgBr) x has glassy phases in a wide concentration range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6. Although this glassy systems are expected to have a similar structure which describes a model of a pseudo-binary mixture of the As 2 Se 3 network matrix and AgBr-related ionic conduction pathways as in glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 1-x (AgI) x mixtures, there has been no structural study. Thus, the conduction mechanism of this room-temperature superionic glass is still open to question. In this project, we have carried out an anomalous X-ray scattering (AXS) experiment on glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgBr) 0.6 mixture close to the As, Se, Ag, and Br K edges. The glassy sample was obtained by simple iced-water quenching the sample in a fused silica ampoule after heating and rocking the melt for at least 48 hours. A pellet with a flat surface was made for the AXS experiment with a pressing tool. The concentration and the homogeneity of the sample were examined by measuring conventional X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis at several positions of the quenched sample. The AXS experiment was carried out at two energies below the K edges of As, Se, Br <ref type="bibr">(-20 and -200 eV)</ref>, or Ag (-30 and -200 eV) at BM02/ESRF. For the diffraction experiment, we used a graphite crystal energy analyser together with a scintillation counter on a long (45 cm) detector arm, which we developed for the AXS experiment. The differential structure factors ∆ i S(Q) can be obtained by taking the difference of two scattering spectra, and the i-th element related partial structure factors S ij (Q) dominate the ∆ i S(Q). Figure shows the ∆ i S(Q) spectra close to the As (crosses), Se (circles), Ag (triangles), and Br (squares) K edges. For the comparison, the total structure factor S(Q) is also given by the solid curve. Clear contrasts are observed among the ∆ i S(Q) and S(Q) spectra. Both the ∆ As S(Q) and ∆ Se S(Q) results surprisingly look very similar to those of glassy As 2 Se 3 [3] and (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgI) 0.6 . Thus the local structure around the As and Se atoms is very similar to that in glassy As 2 Se 3 . The ∆ Ag S(Q) spectrum shows a quite different feature from that in glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgI) 0.6 : the large oscillations almost disappear and no negative dip remains near the first peak position in S(Q). The ∆ Br S(Q) spectrum has a peak near the Q position of the first peak in S(Q). It is worth noting that the ∆ Br S(Q) shows a shoulder at about 13 nm -1 , which contribute the pre-shoulder in S(Q). The partial structure factors S ij (Q) of molten AgBr has experimentally been obtained by a combined experiments of AXS and neutron diffraction by <ref type="bibr">Saito et al. [4]</ref>. It should be noted that both the ∆ Ag S(Q) and ∆ Br S(Q) spectra are very different from those of molten AgBr calculated from S ij (Q) up to the first peak position. Unlike the AgI-doped glass, thus, the intermediate-range structure around the Ag and Br atoms in glassy (As 2 Se 3 ) 0.4 (AgBr) 0.6 would not be molten AgBr-like, which may reflect those in the crystal structures between AgI and AgBr.
