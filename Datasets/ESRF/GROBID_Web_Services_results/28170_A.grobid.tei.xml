<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment has been dedicated to study the interference patterns originated by the light scattered from a sample illuminated by a partially coherent X ray beam. Near Field Scattering (NFS) speckle fields have been recorded by using many samples (see for example Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and the fundamental, statistical features of the intensity distribution has been checked to be as expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . A new method for measuring the pointing stability of the beam has also been tested. The experimental apparatus has been set as follows: the white X ray beam generated in the full beam mode has been sent onto a Si (111) monochromator, to generate monochromatic 12 keV or 24 keV X rays, with a relative bandwidth of the order of 10 -4 . All but one of the Berillium windows have been removed to reduce the stray contribution, and the monochromatic beam was delivered to the second hutch through Kapton windows only. A number of known and unknown samples (see below), that could be automatically inserted and removed from the beam, has been used. The transmitted and the scattered radiation has been collected along the optical axis of the system by a Frelon camera with 0.7 microns equivalent pixel size. The camera has been mounted onto a test bench having three degrees of freedom in such a way to move the sample along the axis of beam propagation (optical axis) and in the perpendicular plane. The former movement was used to investigate the formation of the interference patterns along the optical axis for sample-detector distances ranging from some millimeters up to about few meters. Very close to the sample the sensor records an intensity distribution determined by the shadow of the structures inside the sample, that are the amplitude modulations. For increasing distances the visibility of the contributions arising from the phase modulations becomes more important, and where many stochastic scattered contributions superimpose a speckled field is generated by the phase modulation inside the sample. Test measurements have been performed with a number of samples having low-density contrast at the wavelengths in use. Some of them were calibrated porous micron sized filters. Only static samples have been used and relatively long integration times have been used (typically 100 seconds). The stray contribution has been subtracted from each frame by recording the flat field for each image. The preliminary statistical analysis is being performed trough the power spectra, readily recovered from the measured speckle fields. A complete comparison of the optical and the X ray results is not straightforward because of the partial spatial coherence of the X rays mentioned above, and will need a deep study on the basis of the existing data. Ultimately, the analysis will allow to check if the information gathered by the interference patterns can be used in the X rays regime to implement a scattering technique to enhance the X-rays inspection capability. Finally, the experiment showed that a good quality of the beam and the mechanical stability of the whole beamline are crucial requirements for our measurements, any movement of the beam during the exposure time causing changes in the speckle structure. This sensitivity of the speckle pattern with respect to the beam properties can be used as diagnostic tool for the investigation of beam stability in time. Measurements have been performed by fine tuning the secondary mirror of the monochromator with sub-arcsecond steps. Preliminary data analysis has proved the reliability of the method and its applicability in alternative to the current ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p></div>			</div>
