<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>According to Urban &amp; Feuerbacher, complex intermetallic compounds are 'exceptional metallic systems based on crystal structures with giant unit cells comprising up to more than a thousand atoms per unit cell' (J. Non-Cryst. Solids (2004) 334&amp;335 143). Because of the complexity of their structures and the different length-scales present in the structures due to the large unit cells, interesting physical properties may occur. With these measurements, a feasibility study was performed on the 'amount of complexity' that can be handled with X-ray powder measurements using a diamond-anvil cell. The compounds PdGa 5 , Rh 3 Bi 14 , and Rh 3 Bi 12 Br 2 were chosen, because they show interesting chemical bonding as well as a different degree of structural complexity. The unit cell volume at zero pressure is given in table 1. Rh 3 Bi 14 and Rh 3 Bi 12 Br 2 are isostructural and built up of a Rh-Bi framework with channels, either filled with Bi-or Br-atomes. The stability and bonding as a function of pressure is therefore of special interest.</p><p>Powder diffraction measurements were performed on PdGa 5 , Rh 3 Bi 14 , and Rh 3 Bi 12 Br 2 up to 40.4, 30.6, and 32.6 GPa, respectively, on the marIP using an ETH diamond anvil cell (DAC) at a wavelength of 0.7093 Å. To minimize the unwanted scattering of the gasket, the beam diameter was reduced to about 80 80 μm 2 using the slits of the mar-stage. The SNBL system for cell alignment was used, which improved the alignment process and obtainable data quality very much. In figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> representative powder patterns of the three compounds at various pressures are shown. Unfortunately, data collected from PdGa 5 using a heatable Diacell diamond-anvil cell up to ca. 32 GPa and 300 °C was not usable due to too weak intensities of sample reflections caused by alignment problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Rietveld refinements were performed by the use of the Fullprof and GSAS program packages. For PdGa 5 structural refinements were possible, but in the case of the more complex Bi-compounds, structural refinements were not possible due to the peak broadening at higher pressures and severe peak-overlapping.</p><p>Up to 40.4 GPa, all the diffraction patterns of PdGa 5 correspond to the ambient pressure phase, indicating that PdGa 5 is stable within the applied pressure range at room temperature. Rh 3 Bi 14 and Rh 3 Bi 12 Br 2 were studied up to 30.6 and 32.6 GPa. All the diffraction patterns of Rh 3 Bi 14 , Rh 3 Bi 12 Br 2 correspond to their ambient pressure phases, indicating that both compounds are stable in the experimental pressure range at room temperature. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows third-order Birch-Murnaghan equations of state fitted to the experimental data. The zero-pressure volume V 0 , the zero-pressure bulk modulus K 0 and its presssure derivative K' is derived for the compounds as summarized in table 1.  In order to understand the stabilization and characterize the chemical bonding, quantum chemical calculations were performed by the use of the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. The calculations of geometry optimization and phase stability were performed by means of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) based on the density functional theory (DFT). The results were analyzed using the Electron Localization Function of the valence electrons (ELFV). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows representative ELF images of the studied complex intermetallic compounds. PdGa 5 shows strong covalent Ga-Ga bonds. The "empty space" in the structure remains filled with localized electrons -a pressure up to 40 GPa is not high enough to break the strong covalent bonding. This may be a possible reason for the stability of the structure, although pure Ga is soft and melts at low pressure. For the Rh-compounds a detailed analysis of the electronic properties and ELF topography by use of the TB-LMTO-ASA program package is still in progress. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
