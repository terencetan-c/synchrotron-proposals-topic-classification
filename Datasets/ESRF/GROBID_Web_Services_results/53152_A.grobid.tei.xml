<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Within the oil and gas industry, internal corrosion of carbon-steel due to CO 2 -saturated solutions, commonly known as sweet corrosion, is of widespread concern. On this basis, significant effort has been applied to gain mechanistic insight into this phenomenon, which is driven by the dissolution of CO 2 in H 2 O to form an acidic solution; i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CO 2 (g) ⇌ CO 2 (aq) + H 2 O(l) ⇌ H 2 CO 3 (aq) ⇌ HCO 3 -(aq) + H + (aq)</formula><p>The resulting aqueous phase species stimulate corrosion primarily through supplying reactants for the cathodic process, i.e. H 2 (g) evolution. Iron dissolution (Fe(s) ➝ Fe 2+ (aq)) occurs at anodic sites. Solid corrosion products may also appear as a consequence of these various processes, with their formation dependent upon a range of parameters, e.g. pH and temperature. If adherent to the carbon steel substrate, such solids can significantly reduce the rate of corrosion, and so are integral to material sustainability.</p><p>Typically, CO 2 induced corrosion scales on carbon steel are simply labeled as FeCO 3 . Experimental data, however, indicate that these scales can be more complex, e.g. Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 and Fe 3 O 4 have also been reported as scale components. One ongoing concern about such scale characterization is that most studies are undertaken ex situ, i.e. following removal of the substrate from solution. This procedure may induce scale modification, and so in situ characterization is clearly a more desirable approach. The aim of the beam time was to progress this topic through in situ grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) of a sweet corrosion scale formed on X65 pipeline steel.</p><p>In situ GIXRD was undertaken employing synchrotron radiation (SR) from beam line BM28 (XMaS). For these measurements, a custom-made electochemical-cell (E-cell), allowing both GIXRD and electrochemcial corrosion rate monitoring, was mounted on the diffractometer stage. A photon energy of hν = 15 keV, and an incidence angle (α i ) of 3° were used for data acquisition. ) can all be assigned to scattering from the polyimide film. Following 0.5 h of immersion an additional, quite intense peak appears at 5.5°, which can be assigned to the presence of a carbonated green rust (Fe 6 (OH) 12 CO 3 . This feature is not apparent in the diffractograms acquired after immersion for 1 hour, being replaced by peaks assigned to siderite (FeCO 3 ) and chukanovite (Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 ). Subsequently, the intensity of the siderite peaks increases.</p><p>Given that the initial development of this phase coincides with a reduction in corrosion rate (not shown), it is suggested that this siderite scale likely makes a significant contribution to controlling substrate corrosion.</p><p>Besides the carbonate components, peaks attributed to wustite (FeO), magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), and goethite (FeO(OH)) appear, after 2 h , 5 h and 20 h of immersion, respectively. Currently, we suspect these phases are due to dissolution of some O 2 into the CO 2 -saturated solution, although Fe 3 O 4 has been reported to be an intrinsic constituent of sweet corrosion scale.</p><p>A preliminary report of this work has been submitted for publication in the proceedings of the NACE Corrosion conference (March 2015). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1displays a series of diffractograms from the X65-steel sample immersed in CO 2 -saturated 0.1M NaCl solution (pH = 6.8, T = 80°C) for 20 h. The bottommost plot is that of the polished substrate, acquired prior to immersion. Three peaks, located at 23.6°, 33.5° and 41.2°, can be attributed to originate from the bulk of the substrate, i.e. they are due to α-Fe. Features at low values of 2θ (~ 0° -14°) can all be assigned to scattering from the polyimide film. Following 0.5 h of immersion an additional, quite intense peak appears at 5.5°, which can be assigned to the presence of a carbonated green rust (Fe 6 (OH) 12 CO 3 .
