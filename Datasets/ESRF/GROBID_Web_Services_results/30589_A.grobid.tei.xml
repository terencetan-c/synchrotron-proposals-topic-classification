<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments were performed along the lines of our proposal, focussing on the growth of the organic semiconductor rubrene in situ and in real time. Since the experiments are only 4 weeks ago and the data analysis is still in progress, we can only report the most important findings. Details will be seen in a careful fit of the experimental results.</p><p>In in situ and real time X-ray scattering provided information on the microscopic structure of the rubrene molecules as well as information about the film morphology. Anomalous growth with a delayed rougheneing during growth (that is delayed roughening with thickness) was found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of rubrene thin films:</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a GID scan on a 384 ± 2 Å thick rubrene film, probing the structure in the plane of the thin film. The absence of sharp Bragg reflections indicates that there are no crystallites in the film.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphology of the rubrene thin films:</head><p>The post-growth specular reflectivity of the same film, shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, again shows no sharp Bragg reflections but slight enhancements in reflectivity again around q = 0.65 Å-1 (as in GID). This confirms the above conclusions that there are no crystalline regions but at best some degree of short-range order. Importantly, the specular reflectivity shows pronounced finite thickness oscillations (Kiessig fringes). This is due to a very low film roughness of 10 ± 2 Å, as determined from a fit to the data using the Parratt formalism (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, inset).</p><p>0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 1E-10 1E-8 1E-6 1E-4 0.01 1 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 1E-5 1E-3 0.1 Counts [normalized]</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">q ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ [Å -1 ] Counts [normalized] q ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ [Å -1 ]</formula><p>0 400 800 1200 12 15 18 roughness [Å] film thickness [Å]</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Post growth X-ray reflectivity scan of a 1280 Å rubrene film. Pronounced finite thickness oscillations at low q indicate a very smooth surface (Inset: Zoom for low q range, solid line is a fit to the data).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Evolution of the root mean square roughness with film thickness during OMBD growth of rubrene at 10 ºC substrate temperature.</p><p>The absolute error bar is ±7 Å, while the relative uncertainty is ±2 Å. The film is very smooth and only starts to get rough at around 400 Å.</p><p>The evolution of the film roughness with film thickness is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. As we have only part of the specular reflectivity for fits, the absolute value of the roughness can only be determined with an accuracy of ± 7 Å. Importantly the relative uncertainty between successive fits of ± 2 Å, which is the relevant quantity for our analysis, is significantly smaller though. As seen in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> the roughening of the rubrene film shows a delay, with an increasing roughness starting only at around 400 Å. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> even suggests a certain degree of smoothening (that is a reduction of roughness with time) in the initial stage of the growth. In our experiments this behaviour of delayed roughening is universally found for a variety of growth conditions from 10 to 80 ºC substrate temperature and for unpurified as well as purified rubrene. For substrate temperatures of 100 ºC we find relatively rough films, possibly due to a dewetting tendency.</p><p>The most important finding, however, is the delayed roughening or even smoothening at T 80 ºC in the initial stage of the growth. This is in stark contrast to most other growth scenarios, where the roughness exhibits a monotonic increase with thickness D, and the difference between different systems is "only" the slope of (D). The comparison to a detailed study of another organic semiconductor diindenoperylene where even enhanced (rapid) roughening was found makes the present finding even more remarkable. The anomaly of delayed roughening, or even smoothening, in the beginning of rubrene growth may be related to structural or conformational changes of rubrene. According to a recent study by Käfer et al. 1 the energy required to bring rubrene from its twisted state to the planar state in which it crystallises, prevents the molecules to form crystallites near the surface. After a critical film thickness of 120 Å the molecular conformation changes, which may then start to induce roughening.</p><p>We are presently preparing a publication in Appl. Phys. Lett. We expect to publish other results later. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Grazing incidence scan on a 384 Å rubrene film, showing in-plane (parallel to the sample surface) correlation lengths of about 10 Å for rubrene.</figDesc></figure>
