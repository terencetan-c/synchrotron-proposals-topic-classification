<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Numerous tests involving a range of operating and abuse conditions were performed with the ultimate aim of comparing the behaviour of different cell types and chemistries over various conditions.</p><p>Abuse testing of Li-ion batteries can present significant risks to the operator. A test chamber is designed to minimise the risk to operators and beamline equipment during abuse testing (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.1). Table 1.1. Colour coded hazard levels. Green Calm No venting; no leakage; no fire; no rupture; no explosion, no exothermic reactions or thermal runaway. Orange Slightly Aggressive Leakage; venting; potentially small fire; no explosion; no thermal runaway Red Catastrophic Certain fire; thermal runaway; explosion An assortment of lithium-ion batteries were tested under extreme thermal and electrical abuse conditions during high frequency X-ray CT at ID15 (Table 1.2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Before testing each experiment is assigned a risk level to ensure the operator is aware of the outcome of the test and consider appropriate safety measures.

Each of the test conditions is given a label for future reference. Both fast imaging (F) at 0.8 s and 0.4 s per tomogram and slow imaging (S) at 40 s per tomogram was performed.</p><p>The most developed results to date are those of two commercial 18650 Li(NMC) batteries (LG 2.2 Ah NMC and LG 2.6 Ah NMC) undergoing thermal runaway which are currently under embargo by Nature Communications as we await publication. Preliminary results for each of the tests are included in the appendices. Appendices include unprocessed tomographs, thermal images and voltage-time plots for each of the abuse tests.</p><p>Thermal Abuse involved batteries subjected to high temperatures (ca. 250 Â°C) using the heat-gun (test label R1), which was activated when the batteries began to rotate. The continuous rotation helped to maintain a uniform circumferential temperature distribution around the batteries. Heating continued until thermal runaway occurred. The pco dimax camera stored 17 s at 1250 fps. The post-event triggering for recording the images was activated ca. 2 s after the catastrophic outcome of thermal runaway (explosion or violent venting).</p><p>Electrical Abuse tests were performed by including an electrical slip-ring to maintain electrical contact with the cell during fast rotations. A potentiostat was connected outside the ID15 hutch to control the current and voltage conditions of the cell. </p></div>

Rapid heat was observed after ca. 500 s potentially caused by exothermic electrolyte degradation reactions. The lack of internal support in the 2.2 Ah NMC cell allowed the inward collapse of the electrode material, an occurrence which may have been prevented by having an internal cylindrical support to keep the contents compressed. It is suspected that the PTC activated at the higher temperatures discontinuing the current flow and further overcharge.</p></div>

During rapid charging it is expected that electrode swelling would mostly occur nearest the surface causing uneven strain fields throughout the NMC electrode material. The magnitude of swelling being greater near the  Tomography: Fig. 22. Tomograph of 2.2 Ah NMC 18650 battery before thermal abuse test. Tomograph of 2.2   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>9 tomographies were taken. The dramatic changes occurred over a single tomography (where venting occurred). In the tomographies leading up to venting a thin radial-laminar gas pocket can be seen spreading between the electrode materials, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">25</ref>. DVC could be used to develop a strain profile on the electrode material over time which would highlight the initiation, propagation and effects of the gas pocket formation. The collapse of the electrode material into the centre could potentially have caused short-circuiting along the line of collapse.</p><p>The sudden pressure release during venting could have caused the structural collapse. With the sudden release of pressure, the radial-laminar gas pockets could have funnelled into a path of least flow resistance causing a rapid expansion in the region as the gaseous phase intrudes upwards along the delaminated regions, similar to the formation of a diapir in geology. For simplicity, this potential phenomenon will henceforth be referred to as the 'diapir effect'.</p><p>Again, this highlights an obvious design flaw of not keeping the electrode material compressed/constrained.</p></div>

The separator is expected to melt at ca. 120-150 o C which could have caused a short circuit opening a path for lithiation to occur. The consequent rapid swelling of the MnO 2 material may have been the cause of the crack propagation. The swelling would result in unravelling of the current collecting mesh causing detachment between the mesh and the MnO 2 .</p><p>A metallic liquid started to bubble out of the cell after reaching ca. 200 o C.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>A time dependent strain map could potentially be developed using DVC. The progression of gas pocket formation and electrode collapse could be linked to the temperature of the battery.</p><p>The radial laminar gas pockets appear to form between the FePO 4 and graphite electrodes indicating that the evaporating electrolyte delaminates the separator region from the electrode, reducing the ionic conductive area between the electrodes.</p><p>Unlike the 18650 LG NMC cells, the A123 has an internal cylindrical support which mitigates the potential 'diapir effect' due to the sudden release of pressure during venting.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>During overcharge abuse tests, it is expected that the oxidation of the electrolyte material will occur after ca. 4.7 V resulting in gas generation, pouch swelling and rupture. Delamination is seen between the electrode materials The generated gas appears to seep out at the ends of the rolled cell and expands the pouch. Initially, the gas pocket formation appears to be most severe around the straight regions whereas at the bends there is little evidence of electrode breakdown or gas pocket formation. At the bends in the cell, the rolled cell materials will be under higher tension than the straight regions which appears to help maintain structural integrity during electrical abuse.</p><p>The point of cell rupture can be seen from the sudden drop in temperature (ca. 5 o C) of the cell. This is expected to be as a result of the Joule-Thompson effect and can be seen for each of the battery types directly after venting. The Joule-Thomson effect for venting batteries has also been seen by Golubkov et al. <ref type="bibr">75</ref> .</p><p>When thermal runaway occurred, the pouch cell fell out of sight of the thermal camera and Xray. The cell was repositioned after the test for a post-mortem scan. Evidence of the copper electrode melting is seen. This indicates that local temperatures may have reached &gt; 1000 o C.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments:</head><p>The process of thermal runaway occurs over a short period of time, typically a few seconds 75 .</p><p>Fast tomography involved tomographies being taken every 0.4 s which was still not fast enough to capture the rapid break-down of materials associated with the propagation of thermal runaway, notably, the rapid formation of gaseous products from the thermally and electrochemically driven reactions. The tomographies taken during thermal runaway were spoiled by the extent of dynamic events which occured over the 0.4 s of imaging. The rapid formation of gases and high temperature gradients would result in significant perturbations in the structure of the surrounding materials. Thermal runaway occurred when the battery reached ca. 180 o C. The final temperature exceeded the set limit of the thermal camera. Golubkov et al. 75 reported surface temperatures of commercial NMC cells reaching in ca. 700 o C during thermal runaway. The post-mortem scans reveal what appear to be copper globules which indicate that internal temperatures may have reached in excess of 1085 o C, the melting point of copper.</p></div>

Post-mortem tomograph showing a focused region after overcharging at 7 A and heating above 150 o C. Comments: No noticeable change in the internal structure of the batter was noticed during the overcharging process. It's possible that lithium plating occurred but the high X-ray transparency of lithium may have prevented the occurrence from being observed. A similar post-mortem image to the overheating of a fully charged NMC cell was seen. There is evidence of copper globules indicating that internal temperatures reached in excess of 1085 o C. It's worth noting that thermal runaway occurred at a lower temperature than the fully charged NMC battery. Of all the experiments performed the failure conditions in this experiment are the most unlikely to occur in reality. The experiment was not repeated in the interest of time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comments :</head><p>The A123 FePO 4 battery reached a much higher temperature (ca. 60 -70 o C higher) than the NMC batteries before thermal runaway occurred. In addition, the presence of the internal cylindrical support appears to prevent the electrode collapse caused by the 'diapir' effect seen in the NMC cells. The A123 FePO 4 batteries appear to not only to have superior thermal stability but also superior structural support to the NMC cells, highlighting the importance of intelligent engineering.</p><p>The thermal runaway and ejection of contents appears to have occurred in &lt; 0.05 s. A clear view of this process in the radiographs was hindered by the brightness of the beam after the contents were removed from view, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">81</ref>. Both the aluminium and copper current collecting materials appear to be still intact after thermal runaway which when combined with the final temperature observed for the battery in Fig. <ref type="figure">72</ref>, provide evidence that the battery and it's internals did not reach as high of temperature during thermal runaway as the NMC cells.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 . 1 .</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Figure 1.1.
