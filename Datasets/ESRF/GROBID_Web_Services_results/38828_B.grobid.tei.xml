<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The influence of zirconia nanoparticles while shearing at two different temperatures on oriented structure formation is investigated by using high resolution time resolved wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) for high density polyethylene having broad molecular weight distribution (MWD). In the previous beamtime (26-02-398: 03 December 2007 to: 07 December 2007), our results indicated that it could be possible to generate initial structures at high temperature (142 0 C) just above equilibrium melting point (T m = 141.2 0 C) for linear polyethylene using time resolved small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). However, the result also suggested decrease in the intensity of the equatorial streak with the increasing amount of zirconia -i.e. the presence of zirconia inhibits chain orientation prior to crystallization. The pulse of shear (100/s for 1s) is applied to HDPE of broad molar mass distribution having four different concentration (0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%) of zirconia nanoparticles at two different temperatures: 136 0 C and 142 0 C, followed by cooling to crystallization temperature (T Cryst =125 0 C), where the sheared sample was kept at isothermal condition for 600s to monitor the structure development, subsequently followed by cooling to room temperature. The azimuthal offset between the maxima of 110 and 200 reflection suggest the overgrowth of twisted kebabs. It is noticeable that the highly oriented arc-like patterns are obtained at T cryst = 125 0 C which tends to become intense as a function of zirconia concentration while shearing at 136 0 C, thus favouring orientation, whereas, the arc like patterns becomes less intense as a function of zirconia concentration while shearing at 142 0 C, thus inhibiting the orientation. The striking observation of the experiments obtained at T cryst = 125 0 C, when sheared at 136 0 C is that 110 and 200 reflections in samples containing 2.0% zirconia, lies at equatorial regions as compared to those of neat HDPE and HDPE containing other concentrations of zirconia [0.25%, 0.5% and 1.0%], where 110 reflection appears at equatorial region while 200 reflection appears at meridional region. Thus increasing concentration of zirconia nanoparticles when sheared at 142 0 C, perturbs the chain orientation in the polymer.</p><p>The 2D-WAXS patterns at two different temperatures and azimuthal distributions of the intensities after shear at two different temperatures for HDPE in presence of zirconia nanoparticles are shown in the figures below.</p></div>
