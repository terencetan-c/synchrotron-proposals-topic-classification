<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this beamtime proposal was to investigate both Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) particles and zeolite containing extrudates, varying in level/species of poisoning, with non-invasive confocal micro-XANES, creating a 2-D and 3-D map of the distribution of poisoning in such materials. Ex-situ experiments were carried out to give unique insight into the distribution of metal poisons on these types of materials, combined with chemical information (oxidation and coordination state) about such elemental species, mimicking the conditions of the FCC process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">FCC particles</head><p>Ex-reactor FCC particles (containing high level of poisons) were used to obtain information about the distribution of Ni within not only a single particle, but in several particles. In order to perform novel confocal XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy)/XRF (X-ray Fluorecence) scans on a series of FCC particles, a single line of particles were carefully mounted on kapton tape, supported by an aluminium holder (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Particles were investigated by XRF spectroscopy, by scanning slices throughout the particles. In Ni containing particles, a XANES scan (confocal volume ~20x20x20 m 3 ) was performed in shell and core regions to determine Ni oxidation state and chemical species. It is clear that the distribution/content of the Ni poison is not identical in each partical. However, further detailed analysis was performed in order to clarify these discrepancies. The XRF chemical map (100 x 100 µm 2 ) of particle 1 is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>. The Ni content appears to be located just off centre of the particle, with a limited amount at the shell. The corresponding XANES scan attributes the Ni content at the shell and the core both to Ni 2+ , however the exact speices is unknown (did not correspond with reference compounds). The XRF maps of the five other particles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) displayed a much lower content of Ni, an example of which is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>, corresponding with particle 3. The Ni content was too low to attempt a XANES scan, however, it is clear the Ni distribution is different than in particle 1, where the most intense Ni seems to be at shell region. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Ni/zeolite based extrudates</head><p>Two Ni/zeolite extrudate cross-sections of ~300 µm thick (one calcined and one reduced), were investigated using XRF mapping followed by Ni XANES scans, to determine the distribution of Ni in each sample, and also the species present. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> presents the experimental setup of the XRF mapping, showing the extrudate mounted on kapton tape, supported by an Al holder. Firstly, the calcined Ni/zeolite was investigated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). It appears that elemental distribtion intensites drop off to the right hand side the extrudate, most probably due to thickness effects, however, some hot spots in Ni can be percieved. It can be stated tentitivley that Ni is pronounced at the shell region of the extrudate crosssection, although the data is rather noisy. The corresponding XANES line scan of the sample was compared with known reference compounds, Ni foil, NiSO 4 , NiCl 2 and NiO (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). Although the spectrum is particularly noisy, it seems to correlate mostly with NiCl 2 (or a similar compound), with the edge position pointing towards Ni 2+ . The XRF map and corresponding XANES scan of the reduced Ni/zeolite extrudate cross-section is observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>. It is evidently clear that although both reduced and calcined samples contain the same Ni content, that the Ni signal here is significanltly higher in intensity. This could be due to a heterogeneity between samples in the reduced batch, where some extrudates could contain a higher Ni content than the expected value. Also clear, is that a shell distribution of Ni is present, with the core containing a limited amount. The XANES spectrum is much more intense and can be assigned to NiSO 4 or a similar compound, with the edge poistion pointing interestingly to Ni 2+ . This suggests that although the sample has been reduced, its exposure to air has oxidised the sample.</p><p>In conclusion, it can be said that novel confocal XRF/XANES scans of several FCC particles is a promising method to evaluate poisoning in more than one particle simultaneously, showing that each particle contains a different distribution of Ni. Previous literature results focus only on one particle, where evidently, this is no longer accurate enough. XRF/XANES investigations of Ni disritbution and species present in milimeter sized extrudate cross-sections also showed that this technique can be applied to larger scale materials, observing clear differences in distribution of Ni between calcined and reduced samples.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure</head><figDesc>Figure1bdisplays the Ti and Ni XRF chemical maps for 6 FCC particles simultaneously.
