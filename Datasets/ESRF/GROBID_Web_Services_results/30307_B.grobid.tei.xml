<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Crystals of RC-PSII grown by counter-diffusion techniques in three different media have been test at BM16. Diffraction experiments were done at room temperature in the same capillary where the crystals have been grown avoiding crystal manipulation and at 100K using already known cryo-condition, after extracting the crystals from the capillaries. Assays of different cryo-solution were also carried out using MPD and PEG 400.</p><p>From our early experience we already knew that RC-PSII crystals are sensitive to age. Considering this the original proposal was submitted by the time our freshly purified batch of RC-PSII was ready. Unfortunately no crystals were obtained from this batch neither from a last minute purification one. Beside this unlucky situation we decide to keep on with the diffraction experiments using a big batch of crystals from which week diffraction were observed at a home source X-ray generator at he time the crystals were fresh (one/two weeks old).</p><p>As expected no diffraction or marginal spots were obtained for all studied crystals, 40 to 50 samples. The lack of diffraction can be attributed to the age of the crystals, more than two month old by the time they were diffracted at BM16.</p></div>
