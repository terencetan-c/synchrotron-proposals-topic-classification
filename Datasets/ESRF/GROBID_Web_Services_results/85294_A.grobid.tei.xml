<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the experiment</head><p>The main goal of the experiment was to study products of interaction of Cr(VI) in form of K2Cr2O7 into lipid bilayers composed of either pure 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) or mixed with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). Lipid bilayers which contained DOPE had certain amount of double C=C bonds in alyphatic chains. Using Proton Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) technique, we have already shown that when increasing amount of DOPE in membrane, more Cr is incorporated into this membrane after interaction with Cr(VI). Additionally, in literature there is strong evidence that Cr(VI) has large permeability ratio throughout lipid membranes and during interaction it reduces into Cr(III), although direct mechanism of this process is unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Samples were prepaed in form of liposomal suspensions and solid pellets. Liposomes composed of DMPC/DOPE in ratios of 100:1, 10:1, 5:1 and 1:1 as well as of pure DMPC were treated with 150 mM of K2Cr2O7 for 15 min in room temperature (RT). All samples were further dialysed in 55 °C for 19 h, to get rid of unbound Cr content. Half of samples were dried afterwards. Liquid samples were measured in RT in large volume, only in X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) region due to low concentration of samples, while solid samples were mesured in 10 K and in RT (to study any radiation damage) in XANES and Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) regions. Beam spot size was between 4 x 1.5 mm 2 (V x H) and 2 x 5 mm 2 , while beam spot was little out of focus in order to reduce radiation damage. X-Ray fluorescence was detected by 13-element HPGe Sirius (Sensortech) detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Differences in near-edge spectra were observed for all samples however for liquids, changes in spectra were discreet and all spectra have shown pronounced pre-edge peak characteristic for Cr(VI) compounds. Additionally edge shifted around 2 eV from DMPC +Cr to DMPC/DOPE (1:1) +Cr.</p><p>More pronounced differences were seen in spectra obtained from pellet measurement both in XANES and EXAFS regions. In the near -edge energy range it can be clearly seen that while sample contained more DOPE, the edge position was shifted more into low energy region. The total edge shift between K2Cr2O7 and sample DMPC/DOPE (1:1) + Cr is roughly 5 eV which corresponds to reduction of oxidation state from +6 to +3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>). EXAFS signal has good statistics up to k equal to 11-12 Å -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 C</ref>). It is clearly seen that, coordination environment around Cr atom significantly changed : while for DMPC and DMPC/DOPE (1:100) EXAFS signals are very similar to K2Cr2O7, the DMPC/DOPE (10:1) and (5:1) are similar to each other and completely different to reference. Comparison of this conclusion with XANES spectra on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A, shown it was becouse spectra of DMPC/DOPE (10:1) and (5:1) were combination of K2Cr2O7 and reduced form of Cr which was the most abundant in the DMPC/DOPE (1:1) + Cr sample. The LCF proved this statement and results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 D-E</ref>. The progressing reduction is clearly visible also in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>, where changes in pre-edge peak characteristics as well as in edge position are shown and are behaving in similar way to described above. The last spectrum of DMPC/DOPE (1:1) + Cr sample is for the most reduced Cr. Moreover there is no trace of Cr(VI) and this spectrum is completely different than any other. XANES spectrum of DMPC/DOPE (1:1) + Cr sample is however similar to some Cr XANES spectra reported for bacteria cells treated with Cr(VI), yet spectrum was not clearly identified 1 . Simultaneously, the only thing that was effectively varying in our experiment was amount of C=C bonds, thus we can rule out possibility of dominating factor of Cr binding to phispholipid heads. The double preedge peak for this spectrum indicates different ligands in 1 st coordiantion shell of Cr. Our initial FEFF calculations on model Cr-lipid structures have shown that each those maxima can originate from C -pDOS, O-pDOS contributions mixed with Cr d-DOS. Taking all together, this is a proof, that obtained results present increasing content of organochromium complexes. 1 D. Long, L. Zou, M.Z. Hashmi, K. Cai, X. Tang, G. Chen, and J. Shi, Chem. Eng.
