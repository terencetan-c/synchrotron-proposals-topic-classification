<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Simultaneous GIWAXS and in-situ electrical studies of nanofibers in thin film transistor Organic fiels effect transistors (OFETs) constitute a key component in organic electronics.</p><p>We have studied the microstructural changes and durability of 5,5'-bis(naphth-2-yl)-2,2'bithiophene (NaT2) in operando OFETs using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction.</p><p>The OFETs layout consisted of a highly n-doped Si carrier substrate as a back gate electrode with a thermally grown 200 nm thick SiO 2 layer as the gate dielectric. On top, interdigitated source and drain electrodes were fabricated using electron beam evaporation of titanium and gold followeb by photolithography and lift-off processes. NaT2 layers were deposited by vacuum sublimation. These samples were mounted on PCB slots to allow electrical connections and the slots were introduced into a nylon/metal 3D-printed chamber. In operando electrical measurements were carried out by biasing the transistor with programmable voltage supplies. Two types of in operando measurements were performed: a) Transistor on/off measurements for different voltages + GIXRD measurements; b) Ageing tests (continous cycling of transistor) + GIXRD. A typical diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 2 The electrical performance and the lattice parameter changes were monitored during these procedures. We have found out that NaT2 maintains its bulk monoclinic structure in operating OFETs, and shows alignment out-of-plane but not in-plane. The NaT2 film is essentially a mosaic of sincle crystals.</p><p>A manuscript has already been submitted for publication in Organic Electronics and another one is in preparation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Oier Bikondoa &amp; *Tom Hase -Univ.
