<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective</head><p>The microelectronics industry is actively looking for a CMOS-compatible material with a direct bandgap that could be used to fabricate an efficient monolithic laser source integrated on a Si platform, as alternative to the transfer of III-V based structures. Ge 1-x Sn x has been identified as a novel, viable candidate, with properties somewhere between its pure components : the direct bandgap of Ge is only slightly higher than its direct bandgap, while the direct bandgap of %alpha-Sn is negative.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>While so far the laser regime has only observed at cryogenic temperatures in GeSn structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, strain engineering enables modifiyng materials' properties and thus raising the operating temperature. The initial epitaxial growth of Ge 1-x Sn x layer on Ge substrates usually results in a detrimental compressive strain in the layer. Indeed, larger Sn concentrations are required to achieve a direct bandgap if the layer is compressed : a direct bandgap Ge 1-x Sn x layer under -0.5% compressive strain (relaxed) requires x &gt; 0.11 (0.08). Development of etching recipes selective against Ge and GeSn has allowed to consider suspended structures, that can relax the epitaxial strain. Laser effect with lower Sn content were thus recently achieved in suspended Ge 0.915 Sn 0.085 micro-disks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and in micro-disks made by the co-applicants at the CEA.</p><p>The data collected during the beamtime aim to qualify the relationship between the actual anisotropic strain distribution in the micro-disk and its optical properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>We studied four different samples, described in the table below. Each of them consists in patterns of several microstructures, repeated with different characteristic parameters such as stacking of layers (with step-graded GeSn for instance), lengths or Sn content. Two are composed of micro-disks amd the two other contain micro-bridges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>We used a monochromatic, KB-focused beam of size 400x175 (HxV) getting a flux of few 10 9 ph/s at 8keV. A maxipix detector was used during the entire experiment, although a bigger detector would have been more helpful as we expected to see very broad diffraction pattern but unfortunatly the Eiger of ID01 was not working at that time. For each sample we first measured the incident X-ray beam using a standard Siemens star target, performing 2D transmission ptychography on spiral-scans, which gives us an accurate estimation of the beam profile and focus position, key features for phase retrieval of Bragg Ptychography.</p><p>For each sample we used a microscope to get clear location of objects of interest, and then removed it to reach Bragg reflection of GeSn.</p><p>For the first sample, we tried to perform the experiment relying on this mapping, but the micro-disks are really difficult to align blindly i.e. with only angle scans and rocking curves : a 8 microns-diameter disk upon a 3 microns-wide pillar is almost impossible to align perfectly with the axis of rotation. This, combined with the wide scattering due to the mushroom-shape, leads to a high inaccuracy on the position of the beam relative to the sample, compromising the convergence of reconstruction.</p><p>For the two samples composed of micro-bridges, we were able to used the K-Map technique of ID01 to get mappings of the target bridge, in particular using the scattering at Ge &amp; GeSn (113) peak (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Plus we managed to install a fluorescence detector (via an APD) which was very helpful used at Sn edge to get a clear location of the target bridge's center, by orthogonal scans across and along the bridge (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A lot of efforts was put in measuring repeatedly (004) &amp; (113) rocking curves on a maximum number of bridges in order to assess the distribution of strain. After collecting data from timescan to evaluate the beam damage, we were able to perform spiral-scans (400 pts, 1s/pt) at both (004) and (113) GeSn Bragg peaks at several eta angles (~12) , and at different positions on the bridges : center (where there is the largest longitudinal strain), upstream and downstream, the last two in order to get as close as possible from the frontier between the bridge and the arms which present the highest inhomogeneous strains. The techniques of 3D Bragg Ptychography and Back-Projection multi-angles Bragg ptychography will be used to invert these datasets, but until now the algorithms are not robust enough to converge with our data. Figure 5 : diffraction at low etaangle, 'homogeneous' layer of GeSn</p><p>Last but not least, we studied the micro-disks with step-graded GeSn stacks (last sample). The challenging part was to align the disk with the center of rotation, while avoiding the incident beam to impinge on the Ge pillar which leads to parasitic scattering. We managed to perform some spiral-scans at different location on the disk but the window of the detector might has been too small to catch the entire diffraction pattern. (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>)  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This experiment was very successful as we collected data for numerous analysis, including average strain analysis and more precise measurement as 3D and Back-Projection Ptychography. However we were unlucky with the detector being too small to cover the all range of diffraction from the micro-disks, and the alignement was made very complicated because of the wide tilt of the mushroom-shape object. However, we succeed to perfom promising spiral scans on micro-bridges and to demonstrate that the less distrubed layer of GeSn in a step-graded sample can be isolated and thus reconstruct if the quality of data is sufficient.</p><p>The algorithms for data analysis are still being perfected, notably for Back-Projection Ptychography which should lead to the most robust reconstructions, and we hope for an other round of measurements in order to get wider diffraction pattern with the EIGER detector, both for micro-disks and micro-bridges.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Fluorescence map over a bridge Figure 2 : K-Map around (113) GeSn peak</figDesc><graphic coords="3,342.00,179.10,175.20,149.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
