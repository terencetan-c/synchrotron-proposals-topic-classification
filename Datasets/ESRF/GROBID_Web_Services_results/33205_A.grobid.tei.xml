<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The most successful piezoelectric ceramics, which is widely used in sensors, actuators and other electronic devices, is based on PbZr 1-x Ti x O 3 (PZT). Environmental concerns over PZT lead content could disappear with the advent of new lead-free ceramics. Recently Saito and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> have found such compounds based on K 1-x Na x NbO 3 (PSN) ceramics, whose piezoelectric properties are comparable to PZT. However, the mechanisms underlying the ultrahigh performance of these materials, and consequently the possibilities for further improvements, are not clear at present. The challenge of relating the PSNs piezoelectric properties to their microscopic structure is still open. The main goal of this work is refinement of the local atomic structure parameters and its change near phase transition points for PSN solid solution using the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The Nb K-spectra obtained for powder samples are analyzed using the combination of two techniques: i) fitting of the EXAFS signal in the R space, and ii) the "differential EXAFS" method, i.e. the analysis of Fourier transform of the difference between ) (k χ functions obtained for various temperatures or concentrations x. The last one allows finding out even the weak differences between local atomic structures, taking place with changes of temperatures or concentrations. Experimental: Powder samples of K 1-x Na x NbO 3 (PSN) solid solution were prepared for six different concentrations x=0.35, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.95 and 1.00 at the Institute of Physics at Rostov State University by standard solid-state reactions of Na 2 CO 3 , K 2 CO 3 and Nb 2 O 5 . Several grindings and firings in air at temperatures up to 1150 o C were performed. X-ray powder diffraction measurements confirmed that the solid solutions were single phase ones. The samples were prepared from grinded PSN ceramic diluted with carbon and pressed into tablets. XAFS Nb K-edge spectra were collected for all the samples. The temperature dependence of the spectra in the range from 10 K to 1023 K was studied also. The storage ring was run at energy 6.0 GeV with the electron current about 200 mA. Spectra were recorded in the transmission mode using a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator. Harmonic rejection is achieved with two Rh-coated mirrors, before and after the monochromator. The spectra were scanned in the range of 18.61-20.22 keV, with an energy depending step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>To study the local atomic structure of the NbO 6 octahedrons in PSN solid solution we performed the fitting of EXAFS signal using the iFEFFIT package. Scattering paths were determined by the FEFF7 code. The k-range for the Fourier transformation was 3.5-15.0 Å -1 , the R-range was 1.1-2.0 Å. Fitting of the EXAFS data was performed within different assumptions about the distribution of the Nb atom on the small sphere surface: eight-site model, six-site and 12-site ones. All these models are used to describe local atomic structure of perovskite-type crystals (see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and refs. therein). The radius of the small sphere r 0 and the average distance from the center of this sphere to oxygen atoms R 0 were determined from the results of EXAFS fitting.</p><p>The results of the EXAFS analysis for the temperature far from the phase transitions are shown at Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. As an example, the fitting results are presented for x = 0.5 (see also Table ). The results obtained for other x values are quite similar to these ones.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table. Best-fit parameters</head><p>We following results were obtained:</p><p>-in low temperature phase (10 K and 50 K) the eight-site model is the most suitable to describe the local structure of the NbO 6 octahedron, whereas fitting within six-site and 12-site models does not provide a reasonable R-factor. We also found out that in the orthorhombic phase (room temperature and 150 o C) the 12-site model is the only one providing a reasonable fitting. To describe the local structure of tetragonal (280 ˚C, 350 ˚C) and cubic (500 ˚C, 680 ˚C, 750 ˚C) phases we employed the anharmonic eight-site model.</p><p>-the value of Nb displacement r 0 is weakly depends on temperature and concentration x.

The distribution of the Nb atom on this surface changes during phase transitions.</p><p>-the EXAFS data reveal that the R 0 values are almost independent on x at each temperature. These results enable to conclude that at constant temperature the NbO 6 octahedrons in PSN are rigid.</p><p>The last assumption is supported by the results of differential EXAFS analysis. For this purpose we performed Fourier transformation of the difference between normalized EXAFS functions </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">k X χ</formula><p>is that obtained for the concentration x at the same temperature. As an example, the absolute values and imaginary parts of the differential Fourier transforms obtained at 10 K for different x values are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The differential EXAFS data obtained at other temperatures are close to these ones. It is clear that the differential signal in the 1 st shell range is very weak, thus providing an unambiguous proof for rigidity of the NbO 6 octahedrons in PSN. On the other hand the differential signal in the 3 d shell range is strong. The most probable reason for the latter result is strong relative rotation of neighboring NbO 6 octahedrons taking place when sodium concentration increases. Such effect changes the geometry of Nb-O-Nb atomic chains and, as a result, influences on focusing processes and the 3 d coordination shell signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>The local atomic structure of the lead free solid solution K 1-x Na x NbO 3 (x=0.35, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.95 and 1.00) is studied in the temperature range 10 K -1023 K using the Nb K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. To perform a precise investigation of small changes of local atomic structure during phase transitions we employed the combination of the fitting of all EXAFS spectra in the R-space, and the differential EXAFS method. It was shown that the: the Nb-O-Nb angles strongly depend on potassium concentration x at each temperature, but the NbO 6 octahedra keep rigid geometry. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the validity of new spherical model for phase transitions in piezoelectric ceramics K x Na 1-x NbO 3 . According to our previous investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> one can conclude that this model may be common for all perovskite-like crystals.</p><p>Publication: A short communication (Letter) has been submitted on August 2006 to Europhysics Letters. A full paper reporting the EXAFS analysis is under preparation. The work on XANES calculations is in progress.</p></div>

We have shown validity of new spherical model for phase transitions on the basis of both fitting of EXAFS signal in the R-space and differential EXAFS analysis. Within this model the Nb atoms are located on the surfaces of small spheres of constant radii surrounding centers of NbO 6 octahedrons in all phases. The distribution of the Nb atom on this surface changes during phase transitions. Besides the analysis of local structure revealed that the geometry of NbO 6 octahedra does not depend on x value at each temperature, but the octahedra rotation angles do.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>of the 1 st coordination shell of Nb atom for K 0.50 Na 0.50 NbO 3 .
