<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this project, we studied the structural and morphological stability of Pt nanoparticles supported on undoped and N-doped carbon supports under applied potential cycling using both in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD) and (anomalous) small angle X-ray scattering ((A)SAXS) simultaneously. We aimed for a better understanding regarding the structural and morphological stability of our support-modified electrocatalysts under potential cycling. To study our catalysts, we used our custom designed grazing incident cell filled with 0.1 M perchloric acid as electrolyte and equipped with PEEK foil acting as X-ray window. The samples were prepared by drop-casting the catalyst ink on a glassy carbon (GC) cylinder aiming for an RDE-like Pt loading of 12.5 µgPt cm -2 . X-ray attenuation due to the electrolyte film was reduced significantly thanks to the high-energy X-ray radiation. For each sample, we measured HE-XRD and SAXS scans in the dry state, after filling the cell with electrolyte (wet state) and after activation with cycling voltammetry (CV) of 50 times cycling between 0.05 and 1.0 V vs RHE at 100 mV s -1 . Finally we measured HE-XRD and SAXS scans while applying an accelerated stress test (AST) protocol every 250 cycles.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> indicates the investigated samples and the performed electrochemical protocols, which were adapted from the US Department of Energy 2020 targets, and arising electrochemcial problems during the beamtime (likely due to the capability of the counter/reference electrode or the limitations of the potentiostat ). A reference material (HISPEC3000, 20% Pt/C, Alfa Aesar) and three catalysts prepared in our lab (Pt/(unmodified) Vulcan, Pt/(N-doped Vulcan) N-V 400°C and Pt/N-V 800°C) were measured. The low potential "LP"-AST is investigating the Pt stability and the high potential "HP"-AST is investigating the carbon stability.</p><p>After performing the experiments and integration of the data, we noticed that the background scans measured for the subtraction of other diffraction and scattering responses (e.g. GC substrate, PEEK foil, electrolyte/water, cell body) were not beneficial for further analysis of the data as the background scans would overcorrect and tamper the data. Therefore, HE-XRD scans were background-corrected using a polynomial function and analyzed with the Scherrer approach on basis of the Pt (220) reflex as this reflex is mostly free of any interfering background reflexes. The Pt (220) reflex was fitted best when using two Pt phases, one for a major phase with smaller crystallite size, one minor phase with a larger crystallite size. This is supported by TEM images of the pristine powder. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows the resulting crystallite sizes of Pt phase 1 as extracted using the Scherrer equation. The results for the crystallite sizes of the ex situ pristine powder measured at our lab XRD and the in situ thin catalyst film dry state on the GC substrate measured at the ESRF show acceptable values. The results from the in situ after 50 CV and after LP-/HP-AST state show some variation. So far, the catalysts appear to show for both AST protocols a high structural and morphological stability. But using the simple Scherrer equation here, it is unclear yet if the results show a true trend of catalyst stability or are biased due to poor background subtraction. Finding an acceptable analysis procedure is ongoing work. shows the resulting radii during potential cycling.</p><p>Because the background subtraction and the anomalous contrast failed, SAXS data was analyzed without any further correction. This is acceptable because the background intereference is neglectable for SAXS. SAXS scans were analyzed using a combined model of spheres and the power law. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows the in situ SAXS curves during potential cycling for WSR07-LP-AST. Changes are observed only at low q values due to larger background objects, not due to the smaller Pt particles. The extracted radii of ~14.1-14.3 nm are in agreement with the HE XRD results (which itself are under debate). For WSR07-LP-AST no massive degradation is observed. The evaluation and fitting of the SAXS curves are ongoing work. In summary, we can say that in situ SAXS and HE-XRD are powerful tools to investigate the morphological and structural stability in a catalyst system. But an adequate background subtraction is essential for the correct analysis of such delicate measurements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Crystallite sizes for HISPEC20, WSR07, WSR11 and WSR12 extracted from TEM images, ex situ lab-based XRD and in situ synchrotron-based HE-XRD of the Pt phase 1.(b) In situ SAXS curves of WSR07-LP-AST.
