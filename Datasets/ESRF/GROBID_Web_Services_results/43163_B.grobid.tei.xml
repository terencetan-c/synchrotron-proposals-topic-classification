<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was aimed at the structural investigation of several perovskite-type compounds at different temperatures. Initially, we planned to study four compounds, (CuX)LaNb 2 O 7 with X = Cl, Br and Sr 3 MO 6 with M = Mo, W. However, the reduced beam time (6 shifts instead of 9) and the demand for exploring a wide temperature range (both above and below room-temperature), restricted our study to two out of the four compounds, (CuCl)LaNb 2 O 7 and Sr 3 WO 6 . We were also able to collect the preliminary data for (CuBr)LaNb 2 O 7 , but the detailed investigation of this material should be performed in future.</p><p>(CuCl)LaNb 2 O 7 is a quantum magnet with unusual low-temperature properties. These properties remain poorly understood due to the lack of accurate structural information. Previous X-ray and neutron diffraction studies proposed the tetragonal crystal structure with a sub = b sub ~ 3.87 Å and c ~ 11.87 Å. In this structure, the perovskite-type [LaNb 2 O 7 ] blocks and the flat [CuCl] layers have the four-fold symmetry and stack along the c direction. Electron diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance evidenced a lower symmetry and a larger unit cell. However, no structure determination was performed. Using the superior intensity of the beam and the high resolution avilable at ID31, we were able to observe the superstructure reflections (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and to refine the structure in the correct unit cell.</p><p>The room-temperature structure has the 2a sub × 2a sub × c unit cell and the Pbca symmetry. We found that the superstructure reflections originate from two types of the structural distortion. The NbO 6 octahedra tilt in the a -b -c + pattern, while the Cu and Cl atoms are displaced in order to achieve two shorter and two longer Cu-Cl bonds (in contrast to the four equivalent Cu-Cl bonds in the tetragonal crystal structure).</p><p>The two types of the distortion are, to a certain extent, independent. Upon heating the sample, we observed two successive phase transitions (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Above 500 K, the superstructure reflections with h + k = 2n disappeared, while above 640 K the remaining reflections with h + k = 2n + 1 vanished as well (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The two groups of the superstructure reflections are basically responsible for the tilting distortion of the octahedra and for the distortion in the [CuCl] layers, respectively. Above 500 K, the LaNb 2 O 7 blocks acquire the four-fold symmetry, the unit cell is reduced to a sub × 2a sub × c, and the symmetry is Pbmm. Above 640 K, the ordered arrangement of the short Cu-Cl bonds is destroyed, leading to the overall tetragonal P4/mmm symmetry and the a sub × a sub × c unit cell.</p><p>The phase transitions at 500 K and 640 K are clearly visible as kinks in the temperature dependence of unit cell parameters (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Both transitions are of the second-order. We have verified that the structural changes follow the symmetry rules and are consistent with the second-order phase transition. Below room temperature, the structure remains nearly unchanged. We have performed extensive band structure calculations and obtained a reliable microscopic spin model that is in good agreement with the experimental data and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the magnetic properties of (CuCl)LaNb  Fig. 2. Temperature dependence of the subcell parameters of (CuCl)LaNb 2 O 7 . The solid lines are guides-for-eye.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>2 O 7 . The results are published in Phys. Rev. B 82, 054107 (2010). Sr 3 WO 6 is an elpasolite-type compound. The Sr cations in the B-position break the connectivity of the WO 6 octahedra and allow for their free rotations, opening a new route to the design of ferroelectrics. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns at 300 K and 1173 K demonstrate that Sr 3 WO 6 has two polymorphs with the C-centered triclinic (LT) and monoclinic (2) Å, b t = 17.64750(5) Å, c t = 11.81400(3) Å, α = 89.5470(2) o , β = 125.4528(2) o , γ = 90.2889(2) o for the LT phase and a m = 10.21558(1) Å, b m = 17.87382(2) Å, c m = 11.95679(1) Å, β = 125.5911(1) for the HT phase). The transition between the LT and HT phases manifests itself by splitting of the reflections on going from the monoclinic to triclinic symmetry between 464 K and 506 K. We obtained the structural information on both LT and HT Sr 3 WO 6 phases and provided a consistent description of the temperature evolution of the crystal structure. These results are relevant for understanding other elpasolite-type compounds and for the design of new ferroelectric materials. Published in Inorg.Chem. 49, 6058 (2010).</figDesc></figure>
