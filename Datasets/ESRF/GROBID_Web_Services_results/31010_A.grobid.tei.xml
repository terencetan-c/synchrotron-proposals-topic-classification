<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>HE1927 experiment was devoted to the study of the evolution of magnetic configurations at the interface of an anti-ferromagnetically exchange coupled bilayer which exibits both positive and negative exchange bias depending on the cooling field <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The isotopic sensitivity of the Nuclear Resonant Scattering to 57 Fe has been used to probe only the interfacial magnetization of the hard TbFe layer. The experiment has been conducted in July 2005 at ID22 using a Glass/Tb 12 Fe 88 (15 nm)/Tb 12 57 Fe 88 (10 nm)/Gd 40 Fe 60 (50 nm)/Al (5 nm) sample. First, NRS was measured at room temperature for different applied magnetic fields. Those data are presented on figure1a and could be very well fitted. The two major parameters for simulating such NRS curves are the hyperfine field distribution inside the Tb 57 Fe and the orientation of the Tb 57 Fe layer's magnetization. The hyperfine field distribution chosen for the preliminary fits are close to the results found in literature but we will soon have the exact ones thanks to conventional Mössbauer measurements (CEMS). In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, we compare the magnetic configurations used in our actual best fits and the one obtained from a micromagnetic simulation. This micromagnetic calculation is performed supposing a spin chain and taking into account the exchange interaction between neighbour spins, the magnetocrystaline anisotropy and the effect of the applied field. The very good agreement between the two magnetic configurations confirm the presence of an interface DW mainly in the TbFe layer. The next step was to correlate the magnetic configuration inside the TbFe and the exchange bias phenomena (Exchange bias field, Coercive field, Training effect) observed at low temperature (T=5K). We then cooled down the sample from 300K to 5K under different fields cooling field (H cf ) and, for each H cf , measurements were done along the GdFe reversing minor loops between 200 Oe and -200 Oe, several loops were performed. The NRS measurements clearly showed "reversible" and "irreversible" changes in the TbFe during the GdFe magnetization reverses. The so call "irreversible" changes are evidence by the difference observed on two consecutive NRS spectra recorded at 200 Oe (one obtained just after the sample cooling and one after the first hysteresis loop 200 Oe -&gt; -200 Oe -&gt; 200 Oe). Such variation are at the origin of the training effects (evolution of the hysteresis loop depending on the number of cycle). After two to three hysteresis loops this effect is no more visible. However variation in the TbFe configuration while the field is swept from 200 Oe to -200 Oe is still detectable which characterised the so call "reversible" changes. This effect is at the origin of the coercivity observed in the sample. Those results show that our first hypothesis [1] of a perfectly frozen TbFe after the temperature cooling is not totally valid and that changes at the TbFe interface cause training effect and evolution in the coercivity. Effort are devoted to the spectra fitting and to the study of the results obtained at different temperatures. Those last results should give information on the role of thermal activation.</p><p>[1] S. Mangin, F. <ref type="bibr">Montaigne and A. Schuhl, Phys. Rev.
