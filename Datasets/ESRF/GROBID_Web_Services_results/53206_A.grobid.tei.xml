<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1/ Introduction:</head><p>This proposal aimed to study the conditions for growing an all-oxide Fe3O4/MgO/Fe3O4/CoO/Ag(001) MTJ with a perfect control of the epitaxial properties. As a first step, we optimized the growing conditions of Fe3O4 on Ag(001), got the epitaxial parameters and roughness and looked for possible surface/interface reconstructions. In a second step, we did a CoO/Fe3O4/Ag(001) bilayer film, elaborating then the exchange coupled counterpart of the MTJ. The MgO(001)/Fe3O4(001) bilayer has not been done, yet. Nevertheless, one of the CoO/Fe3O4/Ag(001) films was covered by an Al2O3 layer, instead of MgO, for further transport and magnetic studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3/ Experimental results:</head><p>In previous studies, we found the conditions for the growth of ultra-thin CoO(001) layers (~1 to 4 nm) on Ag(001) and on Fe/Ag(001) surfaces and derived their main structural parameters. We observed that, after depositing 4 ML Fe on Ag(001) and growing Co oxide on top by reactive thermal deposition, the Fe layer is completely oxidized, giving rise to a Fe3O4-like structure <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. The ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) character of such an interface oxide layer has been demonstrated by XMCD experiments at the Fe Ledges.</p><p>During this experimental session, the Fe3O4 films were grown by starting with a 4ML Fe film deposited at 300K (at 475K, in one case), with a rate of 0.2 -0.25 ML/min, followed by oxidization at an atmosphere of 1*10 -7 mbar &lt; p(O2) &lt; 5*10 -7 mbar of oxygen. The Ag(001) substrate was cleaned using the standard UHV tools (Ar + sputtering, followed by annealing at about 800 K).</p><p>The structure and morphology of the films were then improved by annealing at 2*10 -7 mbar of O2 to about 650-700 K. This initial growth procedure gives rise to a well-ordered seed layer of Fe3O4(001) with a thickness of about 1.5 -2.0 nm. In some films, after this initial growth, the deposition was followed by Fe (4 ML) reactive thermal deposition in O2 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), doubling the total thickness of the films.</p><p>The atomic structure of the Fe3O4 layer was studied using surface X-ray diffraction during growth (intermediate step and annealing) and after deposition of about a 2.0 to 3.0 nm thick films.Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the x-ray diffraction profile during the growth of the film. Normalized Intensity (arb. unit) (112) Ag Bragg peak Fe structural peak</p><p>The surface x-ray diffraction signal after Fe deposition (blue and red curves) is observed interfering with the crystal truncation rods (CTRs) of Ag(001). This is a clear demonstration that the film is in coherent epitaxy with the substrate. A structural peak appears at L=2,7 reflecting the 4 ML Fe well-ordered with an out-of-plane parameter equal to 3,026 Å. After oxydation, the signal (green and pink curves) is very similar as the (1 1) CTR of clean Ag(001). This means that Fe is completely oxydized and it is no more pseudomorph. The diffraction intensity has been shifted to another position in the reciprocal space.</p><p>After oxydation and during the annealing, we observed the growth of the spinel (Fe3O4) peaks, as can be seen in the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. It demonstrates the improvement of the layer order. A detailed analysis showed that these peaks correspond to the magnetite peaks.  Normalized Intensity (arb. unit) 300°C 350°C 400°C 430°C, after 15 minutes 450°C 430°C Magnetite peak Normalized Intensity (arb. unit) Magnetite peak</p><p>In total, during this experimental session, we were able to grow five different films on different substrates. A compilation of these samples is presented at the table 1. The growing conditions were very similar, but the final structure somehow different. Two samples have 4 ML Fe and three have 8 ML Fe. One of these former are not covered by a CoO film and one has in addition a capping layer of Al2O3.</p><p>We could check that the growth of the CoO layer did not affect the structure of the Fe3O4 films. Moreover, the surface and interfaces with the substrate of the final layer is extremely flat, as indicated by the oscillations observed along the layer rods (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: it is shown the growing conditions of five different samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4/ Discussion:</head><p>We obtained the conditions for growing Fe3O4 layers of good crystallographic quality on the Ag(001) surface and extracted relevant structural parameters. The preliminary analyzes of the structure factors shows that the phase is that of the Fe3O4 with a good stoichiometry. We get also the conditions for growing a bilayer of Fe3O4/CoO, which is an important building block for the production of an echange coupled system. The MgO/Fe3O4/Ag(001) bilayer has not been done and additional beamtime will be necessary to complete this study. One the samples that has been produced is being prepared for transport and magnetic properties measurements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1:(1 1) CTR (crystal truncation rod) of Ag(001), after Fe deposition and after exposure to oxygen.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,-85.50,429.70,538.60,336.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
