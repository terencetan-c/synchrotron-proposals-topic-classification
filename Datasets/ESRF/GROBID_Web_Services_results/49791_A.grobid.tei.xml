The aerogels were compared to the microporous xerogel analogue and Cu ZSM-5, the well-established deNOx catalyst at which poor hydrothermal stability inhibited its commercialization. We conducted three studies of redox cycling in dry and realistic feed (15 % H 2 O) in NO/O 2 (0.2 %/2 %) and C 3 H 6 (1.3 %). Water was added using a vapor saturator cooled to desired temperature by a chiller. Some remaining time was given a preliminary study on the formation of bimetallic Au-Cu clusters in silica aerogels and hierarchical SAPO-34 systems (H-SAPO-34) with XAS and powder diffraction. The samples were reduced in H 2 (5 %) to 450 °C using a ramp rate 5 °C/min. The Cu-Au aerogel was treated in alternating feed of C 3 H 6 (1.1 %) and O 2 (2.2 %) for speciation in different reaction stages of selective oxidation of propene to acrolein. Both parent materials were found to be highly active and selective for this reaction prior to this beamtime. However, due to time limitations we were not able to conduct the cycling procedure for the H-SAPO-34 system.</p></div>

However, the deactivation from the copper cation perspective has yet to be understood. We find an irreversible alteration of the redox pair Cu 2+ /Cu + in when cycling in wet feed, associated with cation migration to less active sites in the ZSM-5 structure. The Cu xerogel, the hydrophilic and less porous analogue perform poorly as a SCR-deNO x catalyst in wet feed as well, seen by reversible reoxidation to Cu 2+ in C 3 H 6 /H 2 O. The xerogel recovers upon return to dry feed and the active Cu 2+ /Cu + pair was restored, in contrast to Cu ZSM-5. In the Cu aerogel system, the Cu 2+ /Cu + redox pair and local surroundings remain unaffected in the wet feed, thus establishing this system as a promising candidate for further studies in realistic SCR-deNO x conditions.
