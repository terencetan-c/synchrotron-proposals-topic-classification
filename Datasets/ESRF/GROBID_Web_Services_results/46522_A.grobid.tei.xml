<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report on the formation of CaCO3 particles made with sc-CO2</head><p>Experiment SC3114 performed at ID02 -June 2011 Among complex hierarchical structures found in biological systems, calcium carbonate, i.e. CaCO 3 , is definitely one of the most fascinating one. In biological environment, it forms beautiful architectures that are controlled by the interaction of biomolecules with solutions containing the mineral precursors in a process known as biomineralization. Extensive research has been performed on this material to understand how biomineralization can promote specific functions such as mechanical properties or biological functionalities. Such fascinating investigations have encouraged many researchers to mimic the process of biomineralization.</p><p>So far, the biomimetization of these composite materials with the high levels of precision found in nature is still out of reach of engineering scientists. Nevertheless new routes to produce CaCO 3 particles that are not even stable in nature have been quite successful. Let us recall that calcium carbonate is the most abundant biomineral in nature and occurs in three main crystalline polymorphs (calcite, vaterite and aragonite), two hydrated crystal forms (calcium carbonate monohydrate and calcium carbonate hexahydrate), and also as amorphous material. The most stable polymorph, calcite, has a rhombohedral crystallographic unit cell and appears in the form of rhombohedral crystals. The next abundant form is the less stable aragonite which has an orthorhombic crystal structure and which crystallizes as clustered needles growing along the crystallographic c-axis. Vaterite is the least stable of the anhydrous polymorphs. It has a hexagonal unit cell and forms as hexagonal florets. Vaterite is generally not observed in nature and the reason for which one form is more predominant than others is still under debate. This highlights the fact that the understanding of the formation of CaCO 3 is far from being understood. The main reason is the complexity of reactions involved in the process of crystallization. In particular when starting with Ca 2+ solutions in which the source of carbonates originates from the dissolution of CO 2 , many parameters can influence the final state of the product. Among these parameters, one finds of course the pH of the solution, the Ca 2+ concentration, the nature of biomolecules and the partial pressure of CO 2 in contact with the solution. In this study, we use supercritical CO 2 (Sc-CO 2 ) to synthetize CaCO 3 particles according to a process patented by the group of F. Boury (University of Angers -INSERM U646). Sc-CO 2 is a perfect co-solvent for such experiments since it is not only a solvent but it also participates to the reaction since it is the source of carbonated species. The main drawback of this process is that it is difficult to monitor the synthesis since experiments are carried out at high pressure p&gt;80 bars and at T&gt;35°C. The mechanism of formation of micro particules is therefore more predictive than conclusive. In order to unravel the mechanism and to derive structural and morphological information simultaneously, our approach employs time-resolved in situ small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) combined to wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS), using a high brilliance synchrotron source (ID02, ESRF Source, Grenoble, France). The experiment consists in co-injecting the Ca 2+ solution with Sc-CO 2 into silica capillary that is irradiated by a highly brilliant x-ray beam. This allows us to understand and describe the dynamic interplay of the Ca 2+ solution with sc-CO 2 at any time during the pressurization of the solution. Recent experiments have been complemented by in-situ visualization of the solution during the injection of CO 2 at elevated pressures (see Experimental and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The difficult task before us is to understand how precisely microparticles consisting of hollow spheres of CaCO 3 having the vaterite structure are formed when the Ca 2+ solution buffered by biomolecules is exposed to Sc-CO 2 . The main issue is to answer opened questions such as i) when do particles form, what is the role of CO 2 pressure, what is the role of the initial pH and the one of the biomolecule used in the process. For this we carefully analyze the results of x-ray experiments, which at first seem to be quite erratic and we confirm the mechanism of formation by the analysis of the conditions of precipitation of CaCO 3 under pressurized CO 2 . The precipitation of CaCO 3 is achieved whenever the product of solubility of CaCO 3 is reached. As the concentration of bicarbonate ions strongly depends on the pH, which decreases when the pressure of CO 2 increases. Hence, a competition between the precipitation of CaCO 3 and its dissolution at elevated pressure takes place. As experiments were performed in Sc-CO 2 , the first part of the experiment was dedicated to the understanding of the scattering Sc-CO 2 at small angle. We then evidence that the formation of CaCO 3 particles occurs either at low pressure or alternatively during the depressurization of the vessel containing the solution. The signature of WAXS is mainly the one of amorphous particles, which crystallize as a function of time at normal pressure. We also evidence that the precipitation is a highly dynamical process which strongly depends on the pressurization of the cell. Calculation of the precipitation as a function of CO2 pressure is now in progress.</p></div>

The correlation peak is clearly seen in the gas phase at pressure close to the gas-liquid transition pressure. Its intensity increases drastically in the liquid state. The critical fluctuations on the other hand dominate the scattering at low q. The scattering by the fluctuations steadily increases until the transition pressure. They diminish on further compression while the correlation peak continues to increase. As reported several times it is possible to analyze the critical fluctuations by plotting 1/I(q) versus q 2 . The correlation peak can be analyzed by the Fourier transform of the radial intermolecular distribution function. Similar measurements were also made in the supercritical domain at 40°C and up to 100 bars.</p><p>They are basically very similar to the one obtained in the gas state at 22°C and shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formation of CaCO 3 particles</head><p>The experimental observations are strongly related to the procedure of pressurization and depressurization.</p><p>The first step consists in making a circulation of the Ca 2+ solution inside the capillary at a constant velocity of 3.5ml/min. At a given time, we co-inject simultaneously CO 2 at a tunable pressure with a constant flow of Ca 2+ solution. CO 2 first passes through vessel V1 before encountering the Ca 2+ solution in a tee-junction located just before the entrance of the capillary. During this phase x-ray data are collected in-situ. The mixture is collected inside the vessel V2 after passing through the capillary. This phase will be labelled FP1 (Flowing phase 1).</p><p>The second step consists in depressurizing the whole system by opening either quickly or at a slow rate the Depressurizing Valve (DV1) located at the top of vessel V1. In such a case all the liquid located at the bottom of vessel V2 flows back through the capillary before entering vessel V1. This phase will be further labelled FP2 (Flowing Phase 2).</p><p>Note that each vessel is equipped with a purging valve enabling the collection of the Ca 2+ solution after exposure to supercritical CO 2 either in vessel V1 or vessel V2 .</p><p>It is therefore possible to monitor the scattering by the fluid flowing inside the capillary either during compression (phase I) or depressurisation (phase II). The final state of the Ca 2+ solution after exposure to Sc-CO 2 can be monitored by purging vessels V1 or V2 once the system is depressurized. It is worth noting that if depressurization is made in V1 (resp. V2) nothing remains in vessel V2 (resp. V1).</p><p>The experimental results are now discussed for the two flowing phases FP1 and FP2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase FP1</head><p>At the beginning of FP1, i.e. prior to injecting CO 2 , we measure the scattering by the Ca 2+ solution. The scattering is mainly flat at low angle while a peak typical of intermolecular water molecules is seen at wide angle.</p><p>As soon as CO 2 is injected, we observe a strong signal at low angle, which proves that aggregates are forming. This signal vanishes almost immediately and it is replaced by the signal of CO 2 , i.e density fluctuations at low q and a peak characteristic of intermolecular CO 2 molecules located around 17nm -1 . This signal evolves with CO 2 pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase FP2</head><p>During this phase, the depressurization with the valve DV1 forces the aqueous solution and CO 2 stored in vessel V2 to flow back by the capillary. We observe immediately after the onset of depressurization, a strong signal coming from big aggregates. This signal is seen for a pressure going from 67 bars to 40 bars after which the CO2 signal is seen again.</p><p>Note that x-ray scattering performed on the collected solution after depressurisation yields a signal identical to the one of the aggregates at the beginning of depressurisation.</p><p>The interpretation of these results is not straightforward and several scenarios can be envisaged. The main issue is the observation of the aggregates at low pressure of CO 2 and their disappearance at higher pressure during the FP1 phase. This seems to indicate that aggregates do not exist at high pressure. Nevertheless aggregates are seen once again at high pressure during depressurization before vanishing at lower pressure in the FP2 phase. This observation is in favour of the appearance of aggregates during the depressurisation.</p><p>Observing that they are not seen at lower pressure can be easily interpreted by the fact that at the beginning of FP2, the liquid phase is at the bottom of vessel V2 because the aqueous phase is denser than the Sc-CO2. When the DV1 valve is opened, it is impossible to observe the CO 2 signal until the aqueous phase has completely transited through the capillary. It is therefore normal to observe first the signal of the aggregates before observing the signal of CO 2 . If one comes back to what was seen in the FP1 phase the fact that the signal of aggregates quickly vanishes is puzzling. Either they cannot exist at high pressure of CO 2 (which is contrary to what we observe at depressurisation) or the content of the aqueous phase during the flowing of both the CO 2 phase and the aqueous phase is not high enough to observe the signal of aggregates. This latter explanation is likely the right one and if it is the case this would also rule out the fact that aggregates preferentially form at depressurisation. This yields to the interrogation of the existence of aggregates at high pressure of CO 2 . This issue is again not so easy to sort out because aggregates formation is pH dependant.</p><p>It is well known that CaCO 3 can precipitate if the pH is high enough to allow the product of Ca 2+ by CO 3 2-concentrations to be bigger than the constant of solubility K SO . At high pH (pH&gt;10.3), the predominant carbonated species in the aqueous phase are CO 3 2-. Any adjunction of CO 2 in the initial solution of CaCl 2 is bound to favour the precipitation of CaCO 3 since the aqueous phase is controlled by a glycine buffer with pH=10. When CO 2 pressure is increased, CO 3 2-can become a minority in the aqueous solution because pH is Commentaire [BC6] : Au dessus de 67 bars ou en dessous de 40 bars ?</p><p>decreasing with CO 2 pressure. This effect can consequently favour the disappearance of aggregates at high pressure of CO 2 .</p><p>When the cell is depressurized, most of the CO 2 stored in the aqueous phase is released which in turn favours the increase of the pH. This effect can explain the reappearance of aggregates on depressurization.</p></div>
