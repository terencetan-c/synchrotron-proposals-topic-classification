The samples were deposited using cathodic arc evaporation (CAE) at [Ti]/[Al] ratios between 60:40 and 33:67 and at bias voltages (U B ) ranging from -40 to -120 V. Preliminary laboratory experiments revealed that the initial microstructure, especially the phase composition in the as-deposited state, was modified via [Ti]/[Al] ratio and U B [1]. At low U B , fcc-(Ti,Al)N formed as a single phase up to x≤0.5. In contrast, the coatings deposited at high U B contained fcc-(Ti,Al)N as major phase and AlN as minor phase. Our previous in-situ characterisation of the microstructure evolution of Ti 0.5 Al 0.5 N coatings deposited at U B =-40 V and U B =-80 V during annealing at ROBL BM 20 (proposal numer; 20-02-675) revealed differences in the thermal stability of the coatings depending on the initial microstructure [2]. The main goal of the continuation of the previous study (20-02-675) was the investigation of the microstructure development during annealing for a wider range of chemical compositions (x=0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.67) and bias voltages (U B =-40 V, U B =-80 V and U B =-120 V). Thus in-situ synchrotron HT-GAXRD experiments were done at 450°C, 650°C and 850 °C as well as at 100°C after each annealing step. From the analysis of the GAXRD patterns, the phase composition as well as the macroscopic lattice strain and the stress-free lattice parameter of the fcc-(Ti,Al)N phase were determined for all investigated temperatures. The results obtained from the GAXRD experiments are shown in figure 1 for the Ti 0.6 Al 0.4 N coatings deposited at U B = -40 V and stress-free lattice parameter of the fcc-(Ti,Al)N phase (a 0 ) of the originally single-phase Ti 0.6 Al 0.4 N coating (Fig. 1a) showed an increase of a 0 at 450°C and 650°C due to thermal expansion. After cooling from 650°C to 100°C a 0 returned to its starting value indicating that the coating remained singlephase up to 650°C. During annealing at 850°C, diffraction lines of w-AlN and fcc-AlN appeared in the GAXRD pattern. Rietveld analysis using the MAUD programme [3] yielded ~30 mol % fcc-AlN and ~10 mol % w-AlN. This onset of the decomposition was accompanied with an increase of both a 0 and macroscopic lattice strain in the fcc-(Ti,Al)N phase. Further annealing at 850°C for ~100 min did not change the phase composition significantly. After cooling to 100°C, a 0 was smaller than 0.42418 nm, which is the lattice parameter of TiN. This indicated that some of Al was still incorporated in the fcc-(Ti,Al)N host structure; the coating consisted of ~60 mol% Ti 0.9 Al 0.1 N, ~30 mol% fcc-AlN and ~10 mol% w-AlN. In contrast to the originally single-phase coating (U B =-40V), already ~ 30 mol% of w-AlN were formed and only ~10 mol% fcc-AlN could be observed in the dual-phase coating (U B =-120 V) at 850°C. Further annealing at 850°C did not change the phase composition. The analysis of a 0 after the 850°C annealing step revealed that Al fr om fcc-(Ti,Al)N in the dualphase coating Ti 0.6 Al 0.4 N (U B =-80V (not shown) and U B = -120V (Fig. 1b)) segregated after 850°C completely from the fcc-(Ti,Al)N host structu re, because a 0 observed at 100°C corresponds to Al-free fcc-TiN. The fraction of w-AlN and fcc-AlN in the Ti 0.6 Al 0.4 N coating deposited at U B =-80V was for both phases ~20 mol% and lay between the AlN fractions observed in the coatings deposited at U B = -40V and U B = -120V. The same tendency of the fraction of the decomposition products was observed in other investigated coatings.</figDesc></figure>
