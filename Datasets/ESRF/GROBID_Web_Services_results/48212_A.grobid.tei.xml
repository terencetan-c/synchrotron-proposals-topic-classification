<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>X ray diffraction measurements on single crystals of SmFeAsO were performed under high pressure and low temperature conditions. The major purpose of this beamtime was the investigation of the tetragonal-toorthorhombic phase transition of the compound with the increase of external pressure. For that reason we focused our interest on determining the structural phase transition temperature at various pressures, acquiring datasets with small temperature steps of 2K at each pressure value; given the big number of datasets required for such a detailed investigation and the time constraints imposed by the heating and cooling of the pressure cell, the highest pressure we could reach was limited to 85kbars. The mentioned structural phase transition is clearly mirrored in the temperature evolution of the tetragonal 220 Bragg reflection which splits into a doublet (040 and 400) in the orthorhombic phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>); therefore an estimation of the structural transition temperature could be given by the temperature evolution of the (220) T reflection's width. Based on a first stage analysis of our data, we detect the (200) T peak splitting for every studied pressure, a result which indicates the retention of the structural transition upon external pressure at least up to the highest reached value of 85kbars (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>); as expected, pressure suppresses the transition temperature towards lower values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> inset). Although the structural transition is present in the whole studied pressure range, it evidently broadens with pressure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) suggesting that with further increase of pressure the transition would be totally suppressed; additional XRD data at higher pressure values would be necessary to verify this and to accurately determine the pressure where the structural transition disappears.</p><p>However, correlating these results with our preliminary transport measurements under high pressure, it becomes clear that, at least up to 85kbars, superconductivity appears at the orthorhombic phase of the compound.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Selected region of the XRD profiles of SmFeAsO showing the temperature evolution of the (220) T Bragg reflection at P= 6kbars.</figDesc></figure>
