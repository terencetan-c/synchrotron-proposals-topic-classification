<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>B. Golinelli (research assistant), S. Mouilleron (student) (0.8 shift): Structural study of a pyridoxal-P catalytic antibody complexed with different substrates A 2.3 Å full data set of a pyridoxal-P catalytic antibody complexed with a D-ala-pyridoxal-P substrate analogue (space group <ref type="bibr">P21, a=63.1, b=81.1, c=79.3, β=90.</ref>3) was recorded. The completion is 99.9 % (99.9 % in the last shell), Rsym=9.1 % (59.2 % in the last shell). The structure has been solved by molecular replacement and contains the ligand. The structure has been refined to R=25% Rfree=29.8%. A 2.2 Å full data set of the same catalytic antibody complexed with a L-ala-pyridoxal-P substrate analogue was recorded. The crystal was partially twinned ans is currently being processed. Different types of crystals of glucosamine-6-P synthase in complex with two substrate analogs have also been tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L. Renault (1.05 shift) : Study of the GEF-catalysed activation of Arf small GTP-binding protein</head><p>Arf G proteins functions as binary switches in regulating transport vesicle budding in endocytosis and exocytosis and phospholipase D activation by cycling between inactive cytosolic GDP-bound and active membrane-anchored GTP-bound states. Like many other regulatory G proteins, the conversion of Arf-GDP to Arf-GTP is intrinsically very slow and is catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) along a complex multi-step reaction which is poorly understood at the molecular level. This reaction involves binary and ternary complexes between G protein, guanine nucleotide, and GEF, that we try to trap for structural studies by mutations. We have tested on ID14-EH3 different small crystals obtained in presence of different constructs of the small GTP-binding protein Arf1 and the Arf-GEF Sec7 domain of Arno and in different purification and crystallization conditions. We have collected two data sets to 1.86 Å and 1.46 Å on two different crystalline forms. The first crystal belongs to P2 1 2 1 2 1 space group and gives an overall Rsym=8.7% (an Rsym = 42.4% in the last resolution shell from 1.88 to 1.86 Å) with an overall completeness of 97.1% (83.6% in the last resolution shell from 1.88 to 1.86 Å). The second crystal belongs to P3 2 21 space group and gives an overall Rsym=5.9% (an Rsym = 46.2% in the last resolution shell from 1.47 to 1.46 Å) with an overall completeness of 99.3% (97.0% in the last resolution shell from 1.47 to 1.46 Å). Solutions for molecular replacement have been obtained with Arf1∆17 and the Sec7 domain of ARNO as search models confirming the presence of the proteins complex in both crystal forms. Refinement is in process.</p></div>		</body>
