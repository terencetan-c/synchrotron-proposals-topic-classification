<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have prepared responsive gels based on polyelectrolytes (polymethacrylic acid and polydiethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and a manganate-based reaction that oscillates pH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> A weak polyacid will, at low pH, be essentially charge-neutral, because the degree of dissociation of the carboxylic acid groups is relatively low. In these circumstances water is a poor solvent for the polyacid and the gel collapses. However, as the pH is increased the acid groups dissociate and the polymer acquires a net charge; mutual repulsion between the charged chains causes them to stretch away from each other. The opposite pH response is observed for a polybase. By oscillating the pH one can induce a macroscopic oscillation in the dimensions of a gel of a factor of 10 or more. Using triblock copolymers with hydrophobic end-blocks and polyelectrolyte mid-blocks we can make actuator systems that operate in one, two or three dimensions by use of lamellar, cylindrical and spherical gels, respectively. Previously, we have successfully studied the response of a polyacid triblock, which expands in 3 dimensions, in a pH oscillating chemical reaction both microscopically (SAXS) and macroscopically using an optical microscope. The change in volume was found to be affine over 5 orders of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p><p>Recently we have performed such experiments at Dubble using a polybase hydrogel, where we have monitored its pH-actuator behaviour. A sample of PMMA-b-PDEA-b-PMMA was held in the manganate-based pHoscillatory system and was analysed via optical microscopy and SAXS. Autonomous volume transitions of the polymer gel were observed over 7 pH-oscillations, with a typical macroscopic collapsed gel length of 1.5 mm and an expanded length of 3.5 mm. The corresponding microscopic lengths varied between 325 Å (collapsed) and 650 Å (swollen). A plot of the micro-and macroscopic expansion showed that the polybase system affinely changes shape throughout the oscillations (see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>The response of the polymer relies on the diffusion of [H + ] ions throughout its structure; therefore a larger surface area increases the rate of diffusion and thus induces a more rapid response. A more rapid response will lead to more powerful systems.</p><p>Electrospinning polymer fibres enables one to fabricate extremely small (diameter ~ 5 microns), aligned strands of pH-responsive materials, which can be intertwined or woven together to create "rope" like structures. Such bundles of fibres resemble muscle structures found in the body. Natures' approach to solving this problem is to use bundles of muscle fibres in a bath of chemical fuel (ATP) with the macroscopic contraction being the sum of small contractions by many microscopic fibres. Although the forces associated with synthetic pH-responsive polymer systems are many orders of magnitude lower than that of actin and myosin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , the fundamental principles are the same, fast diffusion by using small diameter fibres and macroscopic motion through the serial addition of many small contractions. The natural evolution of this research is therefore to move towards small gel pieces (fibres) that will give a faster response and therefore be more powerful.</p><p>Electrospun fibres however, do not microphase separate into distinct microdomains (due to instantaneous removal of solvent during their production) and therefore their microscopic length scale changes cannot be followed by SAXS. To overcome this, the fibres can be annealed in a solvent atmosphere to allow the polymer chains to flow amongst one another to adopt a more ordered conformation whilst still maintaining its fibre  0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 300 400 500 600 700 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 3 4 5 6 7 8 d-spacing/ Å Time/ minutes Gel Length/ mm pH structure. The annealing process was monitored by SAXS (at Dubble) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Figure 3).  The PMMA-b-PDEA-b-PMMA fibre annealing process, using THF or DMF, follows the same fundamental steps; going from individual fibres with random polymer chain morphology to a dissolved material via a gellike structure with a more ordered copolymer morphology. During annealing, the fibres coagulate as their external surface becomes dissolved, allowing the polymer chains to move around to adopt a lower energy conformation. The more the polymer is annealed, the more order is introduced (as confirmed by SAXS) until the material becomes close to a "holey" film-like structure, then the polymer starts to become dissolved. As the polymer dissolves the order is reduced until complete dissolution of the polymer chains is achieved. Using this information we can now optimise the morphology of the polymer fibre bundle to give an ordered microdomain structure with a large external surface area to allow the desired rapid pH-response.
