<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This was our first microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) experiment addressing a radiobiological question rather than pursuing a purely therapeutic goal. The focus was on the radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE), which are radiation-like responses in cells which have not been directly irradiated. The major portion of the radiobiological expertise for these experiments was contributed by our new collaborators from McMaster University.</p><p>Working in adult male Wistar rats, we conducted our experiments in one of the animal models which we had used previously for our therapeutic experiments. Since the goal of this first experiment was to study the interaction of MRT with brain tissue, the presence of a brain tumour was not required at this stage. A total of 61 adult male Wistar rats were used. All experiments were conducted with the animals under general anaesthesia (Ketamine-Xylazine mixture, intraperitoneal injection). Animals were assigned to one of 10 treatment groups (n = 5 per group) and 2 control groups (n = 4 per group). Gafchromic Film (Nuclear Associates, NY, U.S.A.) was used to verify applied irradiation doses and irradiation patterns (MRT vs. seamless irradiation). Irradiation was given always to the right cerebral hemisphere, while the lefts cerebral hemisphere served as non-irradiated control and potential field of study for bystander effects. MRT: MRT was administered at skin entry doses of either 35 or 350 Gy in one single treatment session, unilateral mode in anterior-posterior direction, with the animal prone on the goniometer. The beam array was 10 mm wide and 14 mm high, with a beam width of 15 µm and a center-to-center distance of 200 µm. In order to assure that irradiation was exclusively applied to the right cerebral hemisphere, the beam array was offset from the midline (sagittal) by 2 mm towards the right. Animals were killed at either 4, 8 or 12 hrs after MRT.</p><p>Seamless irradiation: Seamless synchrotron radiation was administered in one single treatment session, at the same skin entry doses as MRT (i.e. at 35 and 350 Gy), using the same size and location for the irradiation field as described for MRT. Animals were killed at either 4 or 12 hrs after radiotherapy. Non-irradiated controls: 1) Sham irradiation: anaesthesia and movememnt on goniometer, but no irradiation. 2) Cage controls (never left their cage). 3) To show that none of the parameters studied was affected by the expected scattering dose, an X-ray generator was used to generate low X-ray doses at an energy of 200 keV. The whole body of one animal each was exposed to 1, 2 and 3 mGy (Sc 1-3 group). Tissue harvest: The animals were beheaded in deep anaesthesia. The brains were quickly isolated from the skull and cut in the median dorsal sagittal plane, to separate the right and left hemispheres. Two blocks of brain tissue, cut mid-way along the right and left cerebral hemispheres and extending from the dorsal to the ventral surfaces, were acquired. Part of this brain tissue and the urinary bladders were used to set up explant cultures. The growth medium of both brain and bladder cultures was harvested about 48 hrs later. It was then shipped to the Mothersill lab in Canada, where reporter cells were exposed to establish clonogenic assays (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The remaining brain tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 º until processed for proteomics studies, which are presently under way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1:</head><p>Clonogenic survival of reporter cells, fed with growth medium collected 48 hrs after organ explants from irradiated animals and non-irradiated controls. Except in one experimental group, reporter cells did not survive when exposed to growth medium collected from bladder or left brain (non-irradiated brain) explants from animals irradiated with 350 Gy. After irradiation with 35 Gy, clonogenic survival from both left brain and bladder explants was higher after MRT than after broad beam irradiation.</p><p>We wish to thank Mr. Dominique Dallery for the preparation of our experiments and for his dedicated care to our animals, as well as Ms. Catherine Massart for her kind support in all matters concerning the cell culture facility. All members of our research team felt well supported and taken care of by the friendly reception at the ESRF and our new team members were delighted with their stay in Grenoble. Our special thanks goes to our local contact, Elke Bräuer-Krisch, for her energetic and knowledgable support before, during and after our experiments.</p><p>A first presentation of results from this experiment is planned for the upcoming radiotherapy meeting of the British Institut of Radiology.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,295.08,324.84,243.00,215.88" type="bitmap" /></figure>
