<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CM01</head><p>Date of experiment: from: 13 th March 2020 to: Local contact(s): Gregory Effantin Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Janesh Kumar* Anshul Assaiya* *National Centre for Cell Science, S. P. Pune University, Pune-411007, India Report:</p><p>For the allocated beamtime at CM01 beamline, we were able to collect a large dataset (8969 movies) for ligand bound form of mutant GluK3 receptor using the Krios Cryo-Electron Microscope. With the help of the local contact (Gregory Effantin), we loaded 8 grids in the grid loader containing ligand bound protein.</p><p>First we screened the prepared grids and selected the best grids with good ice thickness and particle distribution. We chose grid no.6 and marked good squares with intermittent ice thickness imaged. The following parameters were adjusted using grid hole of each square:</p><p>The grids were loaded on Titan Krios accelerated at 300keV and a total of 8969 multi-frame movies (40 frames/movie) were collected using a K2 detector with a physical pixel size of 1.052 in counting mode with a total dose of 43.72 e/Å 2 . Movies were motion-corrected using UCSF Motioncorr2 <ref type="bibr">(Zheng et al., 2017)</ref>. The contrast transfer function of the aligned micrographs was estimated using CTFFIND4, and particles were manually picked from a few micrographs in cryoSPARCv2 <ref type="bibr">(Punjani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015)</ref>. The picked particles were extracted and subjected to 2D classification. Class averages with good features were selected and used to train Topaz <ref type="bibr">(Bepler et al., 2019)</ref> for automated particle picking in cryoSPARCv3.1. 151525 particles were picked initially; however, after several 2D and 3D classification rounds, 56089 particles were used for final 3D reconstruction. The manuscript from this work is under preparation.</p></div>		</body>
