<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Specific-heat measurements of the recently discovered superconductor SrPt 3 P (T c = 8.4 K) reveal evidence for very strong coupling s-wave superconductivity (2Δ/k B T c ~ 5) [1], consistent with our ab initio calculations which yield a large electron-phonon coupling constant λ ~ 2. In order to test the lattice dynamical properties of SrPt 3 P and the possible strong electron-phonon coupling effects on the superconducting state, we have investigated this material via high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering experiments. The measurements were performed on a polycrystalline sample in 18 shifts of beam time at the inelastic x-ray scattering beamline ID28. The incident beam energy was set to 21747 eV, with an instrumental energy resolution of approximately 1.5 meV. Low temperatures were obtained using a continuous flow cryostat. A total of 153 energy (E) scans were performed at four temperatures: 300 K, 100 K, 10 K and 2.5 K. Typical counting times varied from 60 to 120 seconds using 0.5 meV energy steps.</p><p>Samples were grown at our intitute in Karlsruhe. X-ray diffraction revealed powders containing more than 90% of the desired SrPt 3 P superconducting phase. Diffraction scans (2θ) were performed before measurements to determine the position of elastic peaks. Preferable angles (Q-vectors) with low number of elastic counts were selected to match the initial position of one of the analyzers (analyzer #2 in our case). Elastic peaks were fitted with a pseudo-Voight function and substracted from the raw data to result in the inelastic contribution [Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref>].</p><p>At 300 K, data were collected with an array of 8 analyzers spanning ~ 5.3°, so a total of 7 scans were sufficient for covering the whole 2θ range (8° ≤ 2θ ≤ 45° or equivalently 1.5 Å -1 ≤ Q ≤ 8.5 Å -1 ). An E vs. Q intensity map was created with these data and compared with our calculations of the phonon density of states (PDOS). An initial analysis of the data yielded a rather different result, although this could be due to the different efficiencies of the 8 analyzers. Further analyis will be carried out to account for this effect.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1 -(a)</ref> A representative energy scan between 10 meV and 30 meV measured at 300 K and Q = 5.7 Å -1 (black circles). The inelastic component (red circles) is obtained after substracting the fit to the incoherent-elastic peak contribution (blue line). (b) Inelastic data from energy scans at Q = 5.7 Å -1 obtained at 300 K (red circles) and 10 K (blue diamonds). The black line corresponds to the DFPT calculation.</p><p>In order to avoid the problem arising from comparing data obtained with different analyzers, in the following we focused in the scans of analizer #2 alone. Data-sets measured at different temperatures were corrected with the corresponding Bose-factor. Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref> shows the combined data taken at 300 K for analyzer #2 at Q = 5.7 Å -1 . Our density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations describe the experimental data fairly well above 10 meV. A discrepancy of the data with the calculations exists at low energies. While theory predicts a phonon mode at 4.9 meV, the experiments at 300 K show a peak centered around 6.5 meV. If the calculations were adjusted to increase the energy of this phonon, then it would result automatically in a decrease in the strength of the estimated electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that our calculations underestimate the energy of the lowest band of phonon modes indicating that the coupling of these modes to the electronic subsystem is overestimated.</p><p>As a function of temperature, we observe an overall softening of the low temperature spectra with respect to the room temperature measurements. In particular, a pronounced transfer of spectral weight towards lower energies occurs below 10 meV when cooling from 300 K to 10 K [Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>].</p><p>As temperature is reduced from 10 K to 2.5 K, the inelastic data show no variation within the statistical error. For this reason, we conclude that no clear effects are observed upon entering the superconducting state.</p><p>[1] T. <ref type="bibr">Takayama et al., Phys. Rev.
