<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>α-, β-and λ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 Ca(BH 4 ) 2 is considered as an attractive hydrogen storage material due to high gravimetric capacity and expected thermodynamic properties suitable for mobile hydrogen storage applications. However, the decomposition route is still unclear. In this investigation, Ca(BH 4 ) 2 synthesized by two different wet-chemical methods giving different modifications in the assynthesized powder, were studied. One sample contained α-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 and the other contained a mixture of β-and λ-Ca(BH 4 ) 2. Due to earlier observed reaction between glass capillary and powder at elevated temperatures, the measurements were done using quartz capillaries, and the thermal decomposition of the two samples (α-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 and γ/β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ) were investigated using a heating rate of 2K/min. Bragg peaks from the previously observed intermediate phase, believed to be an unknown Ca(BH 4 ) 2 -modification ("δ"-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ), were observed in both measurements, but in significantly different amounts. Another previously observed unknown phase, believed to be a contamination phase, was not observed in this experiment. Ca(BH 4 ) 2 from ball milling A previously unknown modification of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 was obtained by ball milling CaCl 2 and LiBH 4 . LiCl is formed as a side product which indicates that the reaction proceeds till completion. Fig 2 shows comparison between diffraction patterns of β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 and the unknown modification. Thermal decomposition of this material was studied at MAR. The heating rate was 2 °C/min the phase undergoes decomposition at about 350 °C (Fig. 2). Preliminary temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements are showing that hydrogen release occurs at that temperature. 2D plot shows that in one stage of decomposition there is reaction with LiCl, as the LiCl peaks disappear. Also several phase transitions are observed. The work in determining the structure and the phase transition is in progress.</p><p>10 15 20 25 30 35 40 39729 19864 0 Pow der Cel l 2. 2 icsd_27981_LiCl 50.0% 13.82 15.98 22.67 26.65 27.86 32.27 35.26 36.21 39.80 al f aCa( BH 4) 2 50. 0% 7.83 11.19 11.76 12.39 12.61 14.41 15.36 15.70 17.11 17.70 18.69 19.05 19.53 20.87 21.67 22.05 22.49 22.96 23.64 24.28 24.79 25.37 25.85 26.57 27.08 27.85 28.25 28.76 29.63 30.31 30.93 31.29 31.70 32.22 32.68 33.11 33.53 33.95 34.62 35.28 35.78 36.38 36.98 37.34 37.78 38.29 38.66 39.03 39.54 39.93 40.31 40.67 41.15 Copy of b20_I N D EX_001. x_y </p></div>

Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of ball-milled Mg-Zn alloys Further investigations on ball milled Mg-Zn alloys were carried out. In-situ SR-PXD was performed under 18 bar H 2 up to 225 °C (heating rate 2K/min). This was done to see if the amorphous/nanocrystalline MgZn phase that forms upon ball milling absorbs hydrogen before precipitation of Mg 21 Zn 25 occurs (see previous report and [Deledda, S. et al. (2007). "Hsorption behaviour of mechanically activated Mg-Zn powders." Journal of Alloys and Compounds 446: 173-177]). As shown in the figure below, crystallization of the amorphous/nanocrystalline phase sets in below 200 °C, with no indication of any hydride phases precipitating. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 1 α-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 (left) and γ/β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 (right) heated under dynamical vacuum at 2K/min.</figDesc></figure>
