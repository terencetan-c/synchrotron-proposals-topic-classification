<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We are currently studying several high entropy alloys Ti0.30V0.25Zr0.10Nb0.25M0.10 with M = Mg and Cr, (ii) (TiVNb)100-xAlx (x = 0, 5, 10) and (iii) (TiVNb)100-x-yAlxMoy (x, y = 0, 5, 10) for hydrogen storage applications. These alloys can reversibly absorb hydrogen at room temperature and form interstitial hydrides with high storage capacity. However, the hydrogen absorption/desorption cycling of our materials in the laboratory showed several behaviours depending on the alloy's chemical concentration: several alloys can lose up to 10 % of their initial capacity in the second cycle, whereas others are constantly decreasing the uptake, and few are stable during cycling. The reason of such behaviour is not yet known despite several reports on cycling behaviour of HEAs. Moreover, laboratory X-ray diffraction before and after cycling did not allow us to conclude about a possible structural change nor phase segregation. Therefore, the main objective of the proposal was to study the local crystal structure in various high entropy alloys as well as the induced modification during hydrogen absorption/desorption cycling by in situ X-ray total scattering and associated PDF analysis.</p><p>During these two days, we experienced some beam technical issues that hindered us to measure our samples for several hours. For this reason, we have performed exclusively ex situ measurements of powder samples inside capillaries. We have attempted one in situ experiment on the TiVNbH2 hydride in the last 2 -2 ½ shifts. We could follow the phase transformation during the hydrogen desorption under secondary vacuum by heating from 25 to 400 °C. However, during this step the surface sample get passivated because of small leaks in the vacuum system. Unfortunately, the surface passivation made the rehydrogenation of the desorbed phase impossible at room temperature under 10 bar H2 pressure.</p><p>Therefore, the following results concern ex situ measurements carried out on capillaries.</p><p>We were able to measure the following samples: i) Ti0.30V0.25Zr0.10Nb0.25Cr0.10H2, Ti0.30V0.25Zr0.10Nb0.25Mg0.10H1.6, ii) (TiVNb)100-xAlxHy, (TiVNb)100-xAlx desorbed, (TiVNb)100-xAlxHy after 10 cycles (x = 0, 5 and 10), iii) (TiVNb)100-x-yAlxMoyHy, (TiVNb)100-x-yAlxMoy desorbed and (TiVNb)100-x-yAlxMoyHy after 10 cycles (x, y = 5, 10)</p><p>The figures below show the PDF profiles for the first hydrides, the desorbed phases, and the hydrides after 10 cycles:</p><p>0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 G(R) R TiVNb Al5-TiVNb Al10-TiVNb FIRST HYDRIDE : fcc lattice 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 G(R) R TiVNb Al5-TiVNb Al10-TiVNb 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 G(R) A TiVNb Al5-TiVNb Al10-TiVNb DESORBED: bcc lattice 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 G(R) R TiVNb Al5-TiVNb Al10-TiVNb 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 G(R) R TiVNb Al5-TiVNb Al10-TiVNb AFTER 10 CYCLES AS HYDRIDE: fcc lattice 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 G(R) R TiVNb Al5-TiVNb Al10-TiVNb</p><p>The first conclusions are: • Al addition in TiVNb (5 and 10 %) decreases the intensity of PDF peaks as fcc hydride (first and after 10 absorption/desorption cycles) but not as bcc desorbed phase,</p><p>• The cycling seems to broaden the PDF peaks for all alloys,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The PDF profile after 10 absorption/desorption cycles in TiVNb more rapidly decreases as compared to alloys with 5 and 10 % Al.</p><p>We have attempted to fit the PDF profiles for the TiVNbH2, TiVNb desorbed and TiVNbH1.7 after 10 cycles with the help of PDFgui program using a random distribution of metallic atoms within the fcc and bcc lattices. The fit results are shown below, and the refined parameters are given in the table below.</p><p>If the fit for the TiVNb desorbed is acceptable, there are some problems for the hydride phases, irrespective of the cycle number. Our local contact, Gavin Vaughan, is helping us to improve these fits by introducing defects into the description of the lattice.</p><p>The treatment of the rest of the data is in progress.</p><p>Sample Structure a (Å) Uiso (Å 2 ) Qbroad Qdamp χ 2 Rw Hydride 1 cycle fcc 4.448(1) 0.0105(3) 0.038 fixed 0,023 fixed 0.11 0.28 desorbed bcc 3.221(1) 0.0189(6) 0.04 0.18 Hydride 10 cycles fcc 4.438(1) 0.0189(7) 0.05 0.27</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): *Nayely Pineda-Romero, PhD student at ICMPE CNRS *Tales Ferreira, postdoctoral researcher at ICMPE CNRS *Claudia Zlotea, researcher at ICMPE CNRS</figDesc></figure>
