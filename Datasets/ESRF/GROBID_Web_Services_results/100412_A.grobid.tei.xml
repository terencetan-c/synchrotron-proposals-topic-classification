<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this work, the oxidation state of cerium in a series of Ca(+2) or Sr(+2) and Ce(+4) co-doped LaPO4 and GdPO4 monazites subjected to different syntheses procedures was investigated using high-energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) at the Ce L3-edge. Prior to the XANES measurements, different synthesis procedures to obtain pure phase Ca/Sr(+2)Ce(+4) co-doped monazites had been tested and optimized, followed by diffraction studies (XRD) and elemental mapping (EPMA) of the resulting solids. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (left and middle), selected lattice parameters from the diffraction studies of Ca(+2)Ce(+4) co-doped LaPO4 monazites synthesized via solid state synthesis (left) and coprecipitation (middle) have been compiled. The results indicate, that solid state synthesis produces Ce(+3)-doped LaPO4 without Ca incorporation. In contrast, the coprecipitation route yields solid phases that are clearly different from calculated Ce(+3)-doped LaPO4, implying successful synthesis of Ce(+4)Ca(+2)-doped LaPO4. Moreover, the elemental mapping via EMPA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, right) of a selected monazite composition following coprecipitation synthesis, shows the expected Ca+Ce and La contents for a pure phase Ce(+4)Ca(+2)-doped LaPO4 monazite.</p><p>XANES measurements were performed at the Ce L3-edge on powder samples of both solid solutions with various levels of doping as well as on doped LaPO4 single crystals. Surprisingly, in all samples cerium is mainly present in trivalent form. Powders of the GdPO4 -Ca0.5Ce0.5PO4 solid solution contain slightly larger amounts of tetravalent cerium than the solid solution containing lanthanum. The highest percentage of Ce(+4) in any of the measured samples was 27.6 %, more specifically, this was recorded from the powder sample of the composition Gd0.5(Sr,Ce)0.5PO4. In general the best ratio of Ce(+4)/Ce(+3) was found in powder samples with an intermediate degree of doping (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 left</ref> and <ref type="figure">middle</ref>). With the combined results form the EPMA analyses and the XANES data, the charge imbalance from incorporation of Ca/Sr(+2)+Ce(+3), rather than Ce(+4), must be compensated by the formation of oxygen vacancies.</p><p>Ce(+4) levels in the single crystals were expectedly lower than in the powders given the high temperatures necessary for single crystal growth that facilitate cerium reduction. Low levels of approximately 5 % Ce(+4) were found in highly doped crystals with the compositions La0.1(Sr,Ce)0.9PO4 and La0.3(Sr,Ce)0.7PO4 while the pre-edge region of intermediate crystals was congruent with the Ce(+3) standard. For further analysis of the reduction of cerium in co-doped powders during the coprecipitation synthesisespecially during the temperature induced phase transition from rhabdophane to monazite -a proposal for insitu XANES measurements has been submitted.</p><p>5712 5714 5716 5718 5720 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 normalised absorption [a.u] energy [eV] La00 La02 La05 La08 CeIV CeIII 5712 5714 5716 5718 5720 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 normalised absorption [a.u] energy [eV] Gd00 Gd02 Gd05 Gd08 CeIV CeIII 5712 5714 5716 5718 5720 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 normalised absorption [a.u.] energy [eV] La01_1 La01_2 La01_3 La03_1 La03_2 La03_3 La04_1 La04_2 La04_3 La05_1 La05_2 CeIV CeIII</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Selected lattice parameters from the diffraction studies of Ca(+2)Ce(+4) co-doped LaPO4 monazites synthesized via solid state synthesis (left) and coprecipitation (middle).
