<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The [URE3] phenotype in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is due to an altered form of Ure2p, a protein involved in nitrogen catabolism. To understand possible conformational changes at the origin of prion propagation, we previously solved the crystal structure of the Ure2p functional region <ref type="bibr">[Bousset et al. (2001) Structure 9, 39-46]</ref>. We showed the protein to have a fold similar to that of the‚ class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Here we report crystal structures of the Ure2p functional region (extending from residues 95-354) in complex with glutathione (GSH), the substrate of all GSTs, and two widely used GST inhibitors, namely, S-hexylglutathione and S-pnitrobenzylglutathione <ref type="bibr">[Bousset et al. (2001) Biochemistry. 40 :13564-7</ref>]. Ure2p assembles into fibrils. The protein looses its function upon assembly. X-ray fiber diffraction measurements allow us to access the packing of Ure2p molecules in the fibrils. Also, to determine the extent of changes in the conformation of Ure2p that lead to the loss of its function upon assembly.</p><p>X-ray fiber diffraction patterns of Ure2p fibrils assembled under different experimental conditions were collected. These patterns reveal in some cases cross beta sheet structures. This is part of an ongoing project <ref type="bibr">[L., Bousset et al., (2003) J. Struct. Biol. 141, 132-142]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P. Briozzo (0.26 shift) : Structural study of UMP kinase</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to check the diffracting power of crystals from a soluble variant of uridine monophosphate (UMP) kinase from E. coli., which catalyzes the reaction UMP + ATP -&gt; UDP + ADP. Whereas in eucaryotes phosphorylation of UMP and CMP is carried out by a same protein (UMP/CMP kinase), bacteria contain separate UMP and CMP kinase. The primary structure of UMP kinase is divergent from that of other nucleoside monophosphate kinases (AMP-, TMP-, GMP-, bacterial CMP-and eucaryotic UMP/CMP-kinases). UMP kinase is essential for bacterial survival, and is therefore a potential target for new antibiotics. So far there is no published structure of UMP kinase, which is due in part to the low solubility of this family of enzymes. We have grown small (0.16 x 0.03 x 0.03 mm) needle-like crystals of our variant of UMP kinase. A frozen crystals diffracted X rays up to 3 Å. A set of data was therefore collected (120° of rotation). The collect took 2 hours, including preliminary tries of 3 different crystals. As proteins of known structure which are somewhat homologous in sequence to UPM kinase share less than 20% identity with it, solving the structure of the protein will probably need further MAD experiments.</p><p>B. Gollinelli*, T. Bizebard* (0.9 shift) : Catalytic antibody First, several crystals of antibody 15A9 that uses pyridoxal-phosphate as a cofactor to catalyze transamination of aminoacids (Gramatikova &amp; Christen, J. <ref type="bibr">Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 9779)</ref> have been tested but they were twinned. Finally a 2.5 Å full data set (20s per image, space group P1, a=57.9, b=60.3, c=64.6 α=79.4, β=78.2, γ=80.8) could be recorded. The completion is 98.5 % (94.4 % in the last shell), Rsym=7.7 % (19.6 % in the last shell). The structure will be solved by molecular replacement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Llorens*, M. Graille* (1.03 shift) : yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Structural Genomics project</head><p>The systematic names of the genes are used. More details on every orf can be found on <ref type="url" target="http://genomics.eu.org:targets.html">http://genomics.eu.org:targets.html</ref> 1)YGR205w (target 43). Spacegroup P43212 a=b=65A; c=140A. Resolution 2.25A Completion 100% Rsym=4.1</p><p>The structure of this protein was previously solved by MAD data obtained from Se-Met crystals. The structure revealed an unexpected strong resemblance to the structure of a know enzyme. During this shift, three datasets were collected from crystals soaked with either triphosphate or diphosphate nucleotide. Unfortunately, analysis of the data did not reveal the presence of any nucleotide at the active site.</p><p>2)YDR533c (target 155 ). Spacegroup P21212 a=61A; b=166A; c=48A. Resolution 1.9A Completion 97.8% Rsym=8.1%</p><p>The structure and function of this orf are unknown. Structural similarity may exist with a protein from Methanococcus whose structure was recently solved in a structural genomics project at Berkeley. The protein is probably a protease but this has to be confirmed experimentally. As this orf contains no methionine with the exception of the N-terminal one for 237 residues, we constructed a quadruple methionine mutant. We have collected a dataset at 1.9A resolution from a crystal of this quadruple mutant. We need now to collect a full MAD dataset to solve the structure of this orf.</p><p>3)YGL148w (target 238) Spacegroup P1 a=58A; b=76A; c=91A; alpha=114°; beta=108°; gamma=90°. Resolution 2.9A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completion 90% Rsym=4%</head><p>This orf codes for the enzyme chorismate sythase, which is key step in the stynthesis of the essential aromatic amino acids: Tyr and Phe. The crystal used to collect these data was the first one of this project to diffract. Work is underway to produce SeMet crystals of this orf. 4)LicT from Bacillus subtilis. Spacegroup P3221 a=b=48A; c=162.5A. Resolution 1.9A. Completion 100% Rsym=3.7%.</p><p>LicT is involved in the regulation of polyglucane degradation in Bacillus subtilis. LicT functions as a transcriptional antiterminator protein composed of two structural and functional domains: one RNA binding domain and a regulatory domain. From the same crystal, we have collected two datasets: one at low and one at high resolution. These data are currently used for the refinement of the structure. 5)human VpreB receptor complexed to its stromal ligand : human galectin-1. Spacegroup P212121 a=44A; b=58A; c=112A. Resolution 2.1 A Completion 99 % R-fact_total 0.077 VpreB is a receptor protein which is expressed on the surface of developing B-cells at the preB stage. There has been a longstanding effort in the purification and crystallization of this atypical receptor. Crystals of the V preB receptor were obtained in presence of its natural stromal ligand : galectin 1, a protein of about 120aa belonging to the mammalian lectin family. Analysis of the solvent content of the crystals showed that the whole complex could not be present in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by Molecular Replacement showing that indeed only the galectin1 crystallized. The structure is refined and is very similar to previous determined mammalian galectin structures. Studies are underway to characterize biochemically the interaction between VpreB and galectin in order to helps us to get crystals of the complex.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Ronald Melki * (research director, CNRS), L.
