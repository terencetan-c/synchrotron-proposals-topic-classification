<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This has been a successful experiment in several aspects:</p><p>1. We have combined coherent diffraction imaging and nanodiffraction to obtain data that will allow us to characterise human enamel at the nanometre scale. 2. Diffraction data acquired from the (002) reflection (i.e., a reflection that is orthogonal to the c-axis of the hexagonal hydroxyapatite nanorods in enamel) using a fully coherent beam show interference fringes that with preliminary analysis we potentially ascribe (i.e. prior to full data analysis) to the enamel nanorods having a mosaic structure, instead of they being single crystals, as is generally assumed. 3. Due to the complexity of this mosaic structure that we have found, as a first instance we resorted to CDI instead to ptychography to study the individual small crystals within the larger nanorods.</p><p>4. The coherent diffraction data are of very good quality. We have obtained several sets of data of isolated small crystals. Thus, it should be possible to use phase retrieval techniques to determine the shape of the small units that form the mosaic structure of the nanorods and their strain distribution. 5. In the scattering volume probed, reflections with only the first Miller index being non-zero showed that the nanorods have a random (or at least not well defined) rotational orientation, where the rotation axis is pointing along the long direction of the rods (the c-axis). 6. Reciprocal space maps around the (002) Bragg reflection, using a partial coherent beam, have been acquired at different regions of interest on the sample and should allow us to evaluate an average strain distribution in these areas. Maps have been acquired in 4 m x 4 m areas at different points along a line that goes from the enamel-dentine junction to the tooth surface through enamel to ascertain the differences in texture between the tooth inner and outer regions. In particular, we have observed a marked difference between enamel and dentine.</p><p>7. In addition, using several test samples (patterned motives on silicon, enamel) and observing the evolution of speckles formed by a grainy crystalline structure, we have determined that the setup of ID01 during our experiment was not stable enough for a full ptychography study at the nanoscale. For example, we have estimated a mean drift of ~80 nm/h along the vertical direction. The origin of this drift is uncertain.</p><p>Despite the drift issues that have precluded us from using a ptychographic approach, we would like to note that the beamline is very well optimised, especially for the strain measurements and raster maps we have carried out. We would also like to highglight the technical support of our local contact, Dr. Steven Leake, who has been extremely helpful and has given us perfect assistance when needed.</p><p>Addendum: More recent experiments at ID01 (HC-2282) have shown that 3D Bragg ptychography was possible so we are confident that such an experiment should be fully successful in the near future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Oier BIKONDOA (University of Warwick Department of Physics West Midlands GB -CV4 7AL COVENTRY) * Virginie CHAMARD (INSTITUT FRESNEL -UMR 7249 SEMOX Campus Universitaire de Saint Jérôme Avenue Escadrille Normandie-Niemen FR -13397 MARSEILLE) * Maisoon AL-JAWAD, Mohammed AL-MOSAWI (Queen Mary University of London Dept of Oral Growth &amp; Dev Medical Sciences Building Mile End Road GB -E1 4NS LONDON) *,*Report:Dental enamel is a unique hierarchical material. The aim of this experiment was to visualize the mosaic 3D crystalline organisation of individual enamel nanorods (namely, the crystalline coherence, strain field and lattice rotation), using 3D Bragg nanodiffraction and ptychography. These results are fundamental in understanding the structural and mechanical properties of enamel and may further guide biomimetic models for synthetic reparative dentistry.</figDesc></figure>
