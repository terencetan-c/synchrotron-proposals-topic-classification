<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to control the dimensions of tungsten lines, SAXS experiments were performed using photon energy of 17 keV, to cross a 700 µm silicon wafer, and a beam focused at the sample position with horizontal and vertical widths equal to 300µm and 150µm. The SAXS patterns were recorded using a XPAD pixel detector (960*560 pixels, 130 µm pixel size) mounted on the SAXS bench and located at a distance of 3134 mm from samples.</p><p>In order to quantify precisely the precision of the CD-SAXS technic, two kinds of "reference" samples were studied. It consists of Tungsten line gratings deposed onto silicon membranes:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><p>"1D" lines (periodicity only along the transversal direction of lines, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), allowed us to determine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), from the position and the relative intensity of the diffraction spots, the periodicity of the array, i.e. from the structure factor (~100 nm), and the lines width, i.e. from the form factor (~35 nm). The values are in agreement with the one obtained by CD-SEM analysis. Moreover, the trapezoidal form of the lines were also determined thanks to CD-SAXS patterns obtained after rotation of array of line along the y axis, leading to form factor of lines in the qz direction of the reciprocal space, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>.</p><p> "2D" lines, with a controlled roughness along lines, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, were also studied. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, the periodicity along the y direction leads to the apparition of several lines of diffraction spots. Thanks to the method used for the D lines, a period of ~200 nm and a line width of ~90 nm were extracted. Moreover, the intensity ratio and the distance between two lines of spots allowed us to extract le roughness periodicity (~100 nm) as well as the amplitude (~10 nm).</p><p>Finally, we also performed CD-SAXS measurements on line grating generated with e-beam lithography spin coated on 700 µm Si wafers, samples more conventional in the domain of nanolithography. The period and line width were in good agreement with CD-SEM analysis. Therefore, a line roughness with very low amplitude (~ 2-3 nm), not detectable with conventional technic used in metrology, was measured. In order to treat and to simulate all the datas obtained during this experiment, a software is under devlopement. In parallel, we are also performing CD-SAXS measurments with laboratory equipements. These results will be presented at the "RX et Matière 2015" conference in Grenoble.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Clichés de contrôle dimensionnel par SEM (CD-SEM) sur des lignes: a) 1D et b) 2D. c) et d) sont les clichés CD-SAXS sur ces mêmes lignes. e) détermination du facteur de forme de lignes trapézoïdales.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,35.25,42.00,520.20,205.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
