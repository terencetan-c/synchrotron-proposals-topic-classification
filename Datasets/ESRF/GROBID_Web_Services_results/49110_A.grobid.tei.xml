<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the imaging campaign in 2012 at ESRF ID19, Grenoble, France in total 20 rock samples were imaged (Appendix 1). The cores were from a number of geological settings in Europe, South Africa and the US. The main purpose was to analyze the microstructure of samples under study and the porosity evolution during diagenesis. 2 samples of andesite (AND and ANDALT) were imaged to study how weathering process affects the internal structure of the rock. 8 of the samples were organic-rich shales (Green River Shales-GRS and Karoo shales-DP). They were exposed to gradual rising temperature under atmospheric pressure in the AET-oven while imaged with X-rays CT. A multi-resolution approach was applied to capture 3D volumes with 2.8 and 0.56 µm voxel size. This report will start with a brief summary of each experiment, continues with a review of the samples imaged and the obtained results and publications.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CT on the rock samples: andesite (AND and ANDALT)</head><p>This study was dedicated to processes operating during magma solidification and cooling. The pore structure of two samples, obtained from an andesitic sill intrusion, was determined by multi-scale resolution technique at 2.8 and 0.56 µm and the 3D data were used for transport modeling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Unaltered andesite has a power law distribution of pore volumes over a range of five orders of magnitude. The probability distribution function (PDF) scales with the inverse square of the pore volume (V). This scaling behavior is attributed to the coalescence of pores at crystal-melt boundaries. One scientific paper was published on these results in Earth and Planetary Science Letters (Papers: 1). 3. CT on the rock samples: organic-rich shales (GRS and Karoo)</p><p>In total 14 immature organic-rich shale samples (Karoo basin, South Africa which are denoted by "DP" and Green River Basin Shales, Utah represented by "GRS") were heated and imaged with multiresolutions setup at 2.8 and 0.56 µm.</p><p>Three experiments implying in-situ imaging during heating were conducted: 1) Three cores of 7 mm diameter were heated fast under atmospheric pressure in the oven at three different temperatures 390C, 335C and 290C -GRS_dot_II_npc1, GRS_dot_II_npc2, GRS_dot_II_pc4. 3D images were acquired before heating, during heating and an overview of the whole core after heating (Figure <ref type="figure">3 A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref> and <ref type="figure">C</ref>). Depending on temperature different fracture patterns were observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The higher was the temperature the denser crack network was formed. This data indicate interplay between rate of diffusion of produced hydrocarbons through the shale matrix to the fracture and the rate of organic matter maturation. These results can be used to predict the density of naturally formed fractures in an unconventional shale reservoir depending on the burial and heating history. We have presented this material at two international conferences. We plan to write a scientific publication on this topic. 2) Two cores of 7 mm and 2 mm diameter were placed in non-porous ceramic tubes and sealed from both ends with metal rods. They were gradually heated in the oven from 50 to 800C during 10-14 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Right). The sample GRS_dot_VI_2_heat, a core of 2 mm in diameter was imaged during heating from 50 to 750C and 75 scans were captured at 0.7 micron resolution.</p><p>A porosity network can be detected in all images from the sequence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). More detailed overview of this image sequence is provided further in the report. We have presented this material at two international conferences. We prepare a scientific publication on this topic.</p><p>The sample GRS_dot_II_npc3, a 7 mm diameter core, was heated from 50 to 750C and imaged using multi-resolution technique at 2.8 and 0.56 µm. 22 scans were acquired at each resolution (44 scans in total). At the end of the experiment the confining ceramic cell was broken (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). At some moment during heating sequence the center of rotation of CT was moved and 80% of the scans were featured artifacts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). Unfortunately this could not be corrected and these data were lost for subsequent analysis. 3) Two DP (Karoo) samples were heated at 290 C. One sample was confined in ceramic tube and metallic rods; another was heated under atmospheric pressure. Images of 2.8 and 0.56 µm resolution were acquired before heating, while heating and an overview of the whole sample was made after heating was complete (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>). The porosity structure, crack geometry and shape differ dramatically from the ones observed in GRS samples.       </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Porosity evolution in the sample GRS_dot_VI_2_heat</head><p>During the heating from 50C to 750C dynamics of pore structure evolution in the sample GRS_dot_VI_2_heat evolution was observed. 75 volume of 1900x1900x1000 size (0.7 µm voxel size) were obtained at the rate 8 min per scan. The volumes represent a 0.7 mm field of view in the middle of the sample, however the boundaries are not visible. The image sequence was analyzed using Avizo software and Matlab. TCL codes were written to apply the developed image analysis workflow to the entire image series. Images were filtered, thresholded and labeled (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>). A set of measurements was applied to characterize the porosity evolution with time. The variation of total porosity (volume of all pores in relation to the sample volume) indicates regime of fracture opening and closing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>).  5. Commercial campaign in June 22 nd , 2015 at ESRF ID19.</p><p>The purpose of this experiment was to acquire images of immature organic-rich GRS shale sample at 0.16 µm resolution. This sample was never imaged before with such high quality (Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). This technique enabled to see the micro grains of the shale matrix mixed with organic material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10 A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>). Separate kerogen patches are clearly resolved and their shape is reconstructed in 3D (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10 C</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref>). This data provide very valuable contribution to the understanding of the shale composition and proves that this experimental technique cam be used to investigate how organic material evolves during heating and how micro-cracks originate from the kerogen lenses. We will use this result to propose a future experiment at ESRF ID19. A B C D Figure 10: Mineral grains of the shale matrix with irregularly shaped kerogen lenses.
