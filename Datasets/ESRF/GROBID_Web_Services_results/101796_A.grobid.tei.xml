INTRODUCTION</formula><p>During the two experiments, we investigated the alteration products of the copper and arsenic-based pigments Emerald Green (Cu(CH3COO)2•3Cu(AsO2)2) and Scheele's Green (hereafter called "EM" and "SH", respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> in the oily medium after their exposure to artificially aging conditions (combination of humidity and light). The alteration phenomenon of these compounds, but in particular of EM, most widely used between impressionist and postimpressionist painters, have been observed in micro-samples taken from Théodore Rousseau's "Descente des Vaches" (1834-1835) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). FT-IR analyses and As K-edge XANES imaging of these samples have identified Cu 2+ -carboxylates and As +5 -compounds as possible degradation products of EM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Despite the research already done, understanding the degradation mechanism of EM and SH paints still remains limited and more systematic research is required on the intrinsic properties of the pigments and the role played by the additives/synthesis residues, the binding medium and environmental agents.</p><p>To understand how the additives/synthesis residues and environmental parameters (light and/or humidity) affect the chemistry of EM and SH oil paints, we have performed μ-XRF mapping and μ-XANES analysis at Cu K-edge (ID21) and at As Kedge (BM23) on a series of artificially aged model samples made with EM and SH synthesized powders and with historical EM powders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>The list of samples that we have analyzed at beamlines ID21 and BM23 is reported below: a) EM and SH-based model samples (24 in total): synthesized or historical powders mixed with linseed oil (4:1 weight ratio) before and after exposure to different aging conditions (combination of light and relative humidity); table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> below summarized all the samples analyzed.</p><p>b) set of Cu-, and As-reference powders and of pigment powders used to prepare mock-up samples (ca. 20 in total). All model paint mock-ups were investigated as embedded resin thin-sections (thickness of ca. 5 µm) both at beamline ID21 and BM23 Each reference powder was analyzed as a thin film (thickness&lt; 50 μm) fixed on sulfur-free tape.  ID21-experimental set-up. µ-XRF and μ-XANES measurements at Cu K-edge (8.978 *keV) were performed at the scanning X-ray microscope (SXM) end-station using a fixed exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator. The incident beam was focused with Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors down to a diameter of ca. 0.5×0.5 µm² (h×v). The energy calibration was performed at the Cu K-edge by setting the position of the peak maximum of the first order derivative spectrum of copper foil at 9.00545 keV. XRF signals were acquired in the horizontal plane and at 69° with respect to the incident beam direction using a single energy-dispersive silicon drift detector (Xflash 5100, Bruker).  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">EM-historical (x2)* X X X X EM-synthesized (x 3) X X X X SH-synthesized (x1)* * X X X X *EM= Emerald green; SH= Scheele's green</formula><p>Single point μ-XANES spectra were acquired in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy around the Cu K-edge (8.95-9.2 keV; energy step: from 0.5 to 1 eV). Full spectral XRF mode XANES mapping experiments were performed by tuning the energy of the incident beam around the Cu K-edge. Maps of the same region of interest were collected by employing 20-30 ms/pixel at ca. 120 different energies with a variable energy step (from 1 to 4 eV).  BM23-experimental set-up. µ-XRF and μ-XANES investigations at As K-edge (11.8667 keV) were performed using a fixed exit double-crystal Si(111) monochromator and an incident beam with a diameter of ca. 3×3 µm² (h×v). XRF signals were collected by means of both a 13-element Ge detector and Si drift-diode array detector. μ-XANES spectra were recorded in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy across the As K-edge (11.83-12 keV; energy step: 0.5 eV). The XANES spectra were recorded by following a line across the thin-section, with 5 µm step in the bottommost side of the paint (bulk area) and with 2.5 µm step in its uppermost part (i.e. closer to the surface). μ-XRF maps of the same region of interest were collected using 200 ms/pixel at the three following energies: (i) 11.8759 keV and (ii) 11.87961 keV to favor the excitation of As 3+ and As 5+ -species, respectively and (iii) 12.0 keV to obtain the XRF intensity of all As-species. ATHENA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> was employed to perform the normalization of the XANES spectra, while the processing of the elemental maps was performed using the PyMca software.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Artificially aged mock-ups.</head><p>As an example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the SR μ-XRF and μ-XANES results obtained from the EM-synthesized oil mock-up after photochemical aging with 95% of relative humidity (cf. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>),. Before aging (results not reported), Cu-and As-speciation investigations reveal that, as expected, only Cu 2+ and As 3+ -species are present in the sample. As a result of the aging, a strong discoloration of the original green color has taken place at the paint surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A-B</ref>). The As oxidation state maps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>) along with μ-XANES investigations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>) reveal that a complete conversion from As 3+ to As 5+ has occurred at the surface, while As 3+ -species, related to the unaltered EM pigment, are dominant in the bulk green paint. These As 5+ -containing alteration products are ascribable to arsenates, as outlined by the similarities with the spectral features of calcium arsenate reference powder (green line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>). On the other hand, no evident changes are observed in the oxidation state of copper, that is present across the paint stratigraphy in the bivalent state (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2E</ref>). Slight changes are only visible in the pre-edge region of the spectra recorded in the uppermost 5 µm of the paint surface (i.e. where also As 5+ -compounds were found; see red arrow in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2F</ref>), thus suggesting changes in the coordination of Cu 2+ . Comparable results were obtained from the EM paints aged with UVA-visible light and environmental relative humidity; in the EM mock-ups aged in the dark and with high relative humidity, no arsenic oxidation has occurs instead but the formation of As2O3 crystals was observed (data not reported).</p><p>Concerning SH mock-ups, they show a very similar reactivity with respect to EM samples, by revealing the formation of a superficial As 5+ -rich alteration layer (in general thicker than the one of EM mock-ups) after treatment both in the presence and absence of light. In addtion, in some of SH samples, the oxidation of As 3+ to As 5+ occurred along with the reduction of Cu 2+ to Cu + (data not reported).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
