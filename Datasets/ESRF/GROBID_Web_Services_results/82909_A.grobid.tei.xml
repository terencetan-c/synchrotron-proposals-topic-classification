<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diffraction techniques (neutron and synchrotron X-ray) are known as non-destructive methods to determine residual stresses in crystalline materials. The concept is based on directing a beam on a component and measuring the angular distribution of the radiation diffracted from the material. The relatively high energies involved lead to very low scattering angles, typically ranging from about 10° at moderate energies (25 keV) to about 4° at higher energies (~80 keV). This leads to the formation of an elongated diamond shape gauge volumes as opposed to the (almost) cubic gauge volume in neutron diffraction. Therefore, the synchrotron Xray diffraction is considered as a complementary technique to other non-destructive (and even destructive) methods to evaluate residual stresses.</p><p>The basic concept underlying the non-destructive measurement of residual strains (residual stresses) by synchrotron X-ray diffraction is fundamentally the same as for other diffraction techniques. The method utilises the Bragg's law to identify the relationship between the d-spacing (dhkl) of certain lattice planes to the diffraction angle (2θhkl), at which the radiation is scattered coherently and elastically for a given wavelength of the radiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>nλ=2θ_hkl.sinθ_hkl</head><p>According to the Planck-Einstein equation for photon energy, the wavelength can be calculated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E=h.f E=(h.c)/λ</formula><p>Where E is the photon energy, h is the Planck's constant (h = 6.626×10-34 J.s = 4.136×10-15 eV.s), f is the wave frequency, c is the speed of light in vacuum (c=3×108 m/s) and λ is the photon's wavelength.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">E (eV)=1.2398/(λ (μm))</formula><p>When the frequency is expressed in terms of radians per second (instead of cycles per second or hertz) the angular frequency is used which includes a factor of 2π into the Planck's constant. The resulting constant is called the reduced Planck's constant or Dirac constant:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h ̅ =h/2π</formula><p>Therefore, the values of the reduced Planck's constant are: 1.546×10-34 J.s/rad or 6.582×10-16 eV.s/rad. This experiment was designed as part of the research towards understanding the effect of Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) cladding on the evolution of residual stresses in parts made in an additive-layer process. The main aim was to obtain a thorough understanding of the stress distrbution in parts made by Ti-6Al-4V alloy and investigate the effect of process parameters.</p><p>The high energy synchrotromn X-ray was used at ID22 to scan PTA AM parts made out of Ti-6Al-4V on the subtsrate of the same material grade. The parts were scanned along multiple horizontal and vertical scanlines to gain an understanding of the stress distribution. The PTA AM parts and the scanlines are schematically shown in Figiure 1. Each scan point was scanned in two directions to determinie strain in two in-plane directons.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> -Schematic of the samples and the scanlines for the synchrotron X-ray diffraction</p><p>The energy of the X-ray beam was 60 KeV which gave a wavelenght of 0.20678 Å. The unit cell parameteres for α and β phases are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The α (101) peak has shown the strongest diffraction peak. This can be checked by considering the position of the α (101) peak in X-ray diffraction pattern from Cu-Kα (2θCu-Kα= 40.2035°), the position of the same peak, α (101), in synchrotron X-ray is determined to be 2θsync. X-ray=5.2846°.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference Point</head><p>Therefore, the scanning for each point was performed from 2θ=5.23° to 5.4° with a step angular displacement of 0.5°. Scanpoints were scanned from 5.10º to 5.40º to capture the α(101) peak. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the sample set-up and the schematic of the matchstick gauge volume acrsoss bthe width of the samples. In total, 6 samples were scanned, to study the cobination of the effects of process parameters. In this experiment, three main process parameters were considered to manufacture the samples; the energy input, the dwell time and the deposition strategy. The experiment investigated the distribution of residual strain/stress within the PTA Am parts manufactures using a set of different process parameters.</p><p>Q Incident beam Diffracted beam θ = ~2.65° Gauge volume Y Z X</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 -</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 -(a) the sample set-up on the Synchrotron X-ray beamline at ID22, ESRF and (b) the geometry of the gauge volume of the incident and diffracted beams throughout the width of the PTA AM samples</figDesc><graphic coords="4,345.47,101.15,172.20,181.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>
