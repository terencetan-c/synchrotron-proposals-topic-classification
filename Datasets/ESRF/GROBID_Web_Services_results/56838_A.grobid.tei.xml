At room temperature Eu prefers to be Eu(III), at 300-400 o C Eu prefers to be Eu(II).</p><p>2. The dehydration effect (decrease of the total number of ligands with temperature) is more pronounced for Eu(III) than Eu(II) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). 3. Preliminary fits indicate that Eu(III) can be fitted with a maximum of 3 Cl (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), while Eu(II) has less (still wrestling the data). However, this is using a single Debye-Waller factor (ie ssCl is constrained to be the same as ssO). When this constraint is released it is possible to get rather a lot more Cl into the first coordination shell, with rather large Debye-Waller factors. Still playing with the system to determine the best/most realistic model. Attempts to fit multiple-scattering peaks will hopefully pin down the coordination number.</p><p>4. The same dilema, that the number of Cl increased when the number of constraints were loosed, was observed with the preliminary fits of the Gd data. However, it appears that at 400 o C, there are about 7 ligands around the Gd (consistent with the dehydration effect observed by eg. <ref type="bibr">Mayanovic et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr">Mayanovic et al. , 2003))</ref>. When the data were fitted as GdO n Cl m with n=0-7 and m=7-0, n+m=7, the best fit was with GdO 3 Cl 4 ; however the fits with O ranging from 1 to 4 with Cl ranging from 6 to 3 were virtually (statistically) equally good. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Fig 1. R-space plot showing end-member salinities and temperature data collected for Eu(II) and Eu(III). The dehydration effect with temperature is more pronounced for Eu(III) than Eu(II). Fig. 2 Preliminary fits for Eu(III) in 16 m LiCl, results given below. Fig. 3 Eu(II) and Eu(III) E-space spectra, oxidation of Eu(II) at 35 o C is evident.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Eu(II) and Eu(III) k-space spectra. The peak at 1.6 Å -1 is related to the Eu(II) oxidation; this peak is shifted slightly for Eu(III) solutions (1.9 Å -1 ) and decreases with increasing temperature. There is no (obvious) evidence for the multi-electron excitation peak (between 6-8 Å -1 ) discussed by eg. <ref type="bibr">Moreau et al. (2002) and</ref><ref type="bibr">D'Angelo et al. (1996)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Data were collected at the Eu L 2 -edge (7617 eV) at the BM-30B (FAME) beam line, using the high T-P autoclave developed by the CNRS. Initial measurements were collected at the Eu L 3 -edge (6977 eV), however there was enough Fe in the Be windows of the autoclave to have a measurable Fe edge, which added substantial noise to the Eu-EXAFS. This was elimated by collecting data at the L 2 edge. An added bonus was that there appeared to be no discernable signal from muti-electron exictations which have given previous experimenters some headaches when collecting data at the L 3 edge. For comparison, 3 Gd solutions were measured at 0 and 2 m NaCl and 10 m LiCl.</p></div>
