<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p>We wanted to do a scanning 3DXRD experiment and wanted to study much smaller grains and their orientations than what has been studied before. The originally planned sample system was not prepared successfully, despite many attempts over the preceding year. Instead we did the S3DXRD experiment using Ni/YSZ. Our idea was to see grain coarsening effects as we heat the sample at 800C for a long time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment</head><p>We used fluorescence imaging to get an idea of which region we should measure on our sample. We performed the S3DXRD experiment on a 8*8*8 micron field of view as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The first experiment lasted for 12 hours.</p><p>We then changed samples and used a different sample to measure for 8 hours. During this time we performed heating in a controlled environment at 800 deg C for 12 hours.</p><p>We used fluorescence to roughly get to the same sample position and repeated the 18 hour e xperiment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We can confirm that the S3DXRD experiment worked and we could see orientation of grains as small as 300 nm. We also observed Ni coarsening with both the fluorescence imaging and diffraction imaging which would help us confirm our claims in this study.
