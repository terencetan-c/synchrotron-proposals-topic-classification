Obtained nanocrystal solids yield novel collective properties, which makes them interesting for many potential technological applications, such as solar cells, photodetectors, transistors, lightemitting diodes, etc. In situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) represent powerful techniques to study the real-time assembly of nanocrystal superlattices with subsecond temporal and micrometer spatial resolution.</p><p>In the allocated beamtime, we aimed to invesigate the detailed formation of crystalline superlattices of PbS nanocrystals from the colloidal suspension through controlled solvent evaporation using in situ SAXS/WAXS. The real-time evaporative assembly of PbS nanocrystals was monitored in a custom-built chamber equipped with two Kapton windows for the incident and scattered X-ray beam. This chamber included the inner sample cell, where the nanoparticle solution was injected through a thin capillary, which consisted of a copper holder with two silicon nitride membranes at 0.5 mm separation. The overall nanoparticle solution volume was approximately 24 µl. The size of X-ray-transparent silicon nitride windows was 5 mm x 5 mm with a membrane thickness of 0.5 or 1 µm. Before the sample was filled in, the chamber was evacuated and flushed with helium twice and then the corresponding amount of pure solvent was placed in the chamber to obtain the saturated vapor environment. In this way, the nanoparticle solution started to evaporate only after the helium flow was turned on. The typical helium flow rate was kept as low as 1-2 cm 3 /min to ensure slow solvent evaporation. In this way, the complete evaporation of 24 µl of the nanoparticle solution took up to 3 hours depending on the solvent used. During all measurements the cell temperature was kept constant at 25 °C.</p><p>The energy of the incident X-ray beam was set at 12.46 keV and the beam size was 100 µm (vertical) x 200 µm (horizontal). The SAXS data were recorded by a Rayonix MX-170HS charge-coupled device (CCD) area detector and the sample-to-detector distance was 1.735 m. Images were collected with exposure times ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 seconds. Background scattering of the solvent and the experimental setup were subtracted from data. It has to be noted that no beam damage of the sample was observed for the chosen exposure times.</p><p>Nearly monodisperse PbS nanocrystals were produced in our laboratory in a colloidal solution by a hot-injection method. We have studied the self-assembly of PbS nanocrystals with two sizes (3.9 and 7.8 nm in diameter), dispersed in different solvens (hexane, heptane, octane, toluene) at different concentrations (1 -25 mg/ml). We observed the real-time formation of highly ordered superlattices from the colloidal solution upon controlled evaporation in a solvent vapor saturated atmosphere. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the SAXS patterns of a colloidal suspension before the evaporation and the self-assembled crystalline phase of 3.9 nm particles. Further analysis is currently ongoing. The results are planned to be published in the near future. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1.
