<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of experiment CH-2826 was to investigate the process of photo-induced bond breakage and ionrelease from the tri-metallic compound AgIr 2 (dimen) 4 , see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in the beamtime application. Basic feasibility of the proposed experiment had been established previously, cf. The Beamtime Application for CH-2826, and indeed the first measurements of the non-encapsulating Ir 2 (dimen) 4 compound in acetonitrile yielded good results, as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows. -Of primary importance in this plot is the presence of clearly visible oscillations at high values of the scattering vector Q, indicating the posssiblity for good structural refinement.</p><p>To investigate the bond breakage and ion-release process, silver was added to the circulating solution as AgPF6. Upon restarting the data collection, it became evident that the promising preliminary results presented in the beamtime applications Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> were not reproduced, e.g. the expected drop in low-Q intensity in the difference scattering images was not observed. Following prolonged data acquisition, the lack of a signal indicating dissociation was confirmed and increasing instability of the sample flow and jet was becoming evident. Following extensive cleaning of the flow system, a good signal from the contraction of the Ir 2 (dimen) 4 host compound was recovered, but laser timing had been lost due to loss of mode-lock on the laser system, possibly due to faulty aircondition and thus lack of temperature control in the experimental hutch. Extensive work by the beamline staff on the laser system was not succesful in re-establishing the femtosecond laser system to adequate working conditions. On this background it was decided to use the DM50 530 nm pump-laser system, although the 1us pulse length would preclude studying the ultrafast ion-release process. However, it was felt that good data on the host compound could be acquired.</p><p>Experiment continued with the long laser pulse, but was significantly hampered by the lack of temperature control in the hutch, as this led to several instabilities in the beamline setup, such as occasional drop-out of the high-speed chopper, despite intense efforts on the part of the beamline staff. However, in spite of the instabilities, high-quality data were acquired under these somewhat unusual conditions on both solvent + inert chromophore (CH 3 CN/ KMnO 4 ) as well as on the Ir 2 (dimen) 4 compound; this is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>Based on the very good quality (S/noise and S/background) of the low-time-resolution data, it was decided in consultation with the beamline staff to attempt a liquid-state experiment using monochomatic radiation, as opposed to the usual polychromatic and exceptionally intense X-radiation from U17. This entails a drop of at least two orders of magnitude in the X-ray intensity, but may yield benefits in terms of increased structural resolution. As Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows, this trial experiment was succesful and has allowed some interesting considerations regarding optimum experiment design in terms of spectral X-ray intensity distribution and overall intensity.</p><p>In summary, technical difficulties ultimately due to faulty airconditioning in the experimental hutch and an unstable fs laser system precluded the acquisition of high-quality data on the originally proposed ion-release process, although basic feasibility was reconfirmed. However, discussions with the beamline staff resulted in a swith to experimental conditions with much lower time resolution, but higher signal strength, that led to data of high quality on the host compound, which is in itself of scientific interest.</p><p>As compensation for the beamtime lost due to technical difficulties, we were invited for additional beamtime at ID09B in September 2009. Unfortunately, an unexpected reaction between the Ag ions and a co-precipitate of one of the Ir 2 (dimen) 4 precursor compounds prevented us from obtaining good data on the ion-release process, but several related key experiments were succesful during this experimental run, most importantly very good 10 ps "time-slicing" data on the Ir host compound were obtained. We expect that the analysis of this and related data sets will result in the first determination of the excited-state structure of the Ir 2 (dimen) 4 compund in solution, and expect to submit these results for publication in 2010. These results will also provide a solid foundation on which to interpret later data on the ion-release process. We gratefully acknwledge the helpfulness and competence of the ID09B staff, especially when faced with difficulties of a technical nature beyond their control.
