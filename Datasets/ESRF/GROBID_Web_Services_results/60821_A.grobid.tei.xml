<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Carbon dioxide, CO 2 , is one of the most important chemicals in nature. It is also, after water, the second most abundant volatile in the Earth's interior. Despite the simple stoichiometry, CO 2 has quite a complex phase diagram consisting of a number of crystalline molecular polymorphs below 40 GPa. On further compression it starts to polymerize forming at moderate temperatures (up to 680 K) amorphous glass containing carbon in threefold and fourfold coordination, while the laser heating above 1800 K / 40 GPa yields an extended covalent crystal phase (CO 2 -V, space group I42d), described as a network of fourfold coordinated carbon atoms interconnected by oxygen bridges resembling structurally βcristobalite SiO 2 . Apparently the substantial kinetic barrier resulting from reconstruction of the bonding scheme may preclude further transformation at ambient temperature leading to quenching metastable states in the stability field of CO 2 -V, which has stirred major controversies. In this experiment we have tackled the problem of chemical and phase stability of carbon dioxide at megabar pressures, the range unexplored in previous studies. Liquefied CO 2 was loaded cryogenically at -25˚C and 23 bar into the diamond anvil cell, together with a tiny ruby sphere for controlling the initial pressure and several specks of MgCO 3 , which facilitated heating on the sample due to its laser absorbance. No thermal insulation of the diamonds was applied. The sample was subsequently compressed to about 85 GPa while monitoring the XRD pattern. A progressive broadening and eventual full disappearance of the Bragg peaks evidenced the formation of amorphous glass, in agreement with previous reports. Subsequently, the sample was laser-heated for 5-10 min to ~2700 K in two cycles (Figure). Magnesium carbonate served as a sufficient absorber of laser energy, allowing to reach much higher temperature than in previous studies. The diffraction pattern</p></div>

It should be emphasized that the minor broad features present at the both sides of the most intense CO 2 -V reflection disappeared after the second cycle of laser heating, while the peaks attributed to CO 2 -V became sharper and less textured. Hence, our experimental data demonstrate that the other forms of carbon dioxide, either amorphous or crystalline, reported previously within this pressure-temperature window, are actually kinetically trapped metastable states. Moreover, in contrast to earlier reports we did not find any proof for splitting carbon dioxide into its two component elements carbon and oxygen or the transformation to ionic carbonates above one megabar. On the other hand, our results are perfectly consistent with the recent calculations indicating that the polymeric CO 2 does not decompose up to at least 200 GPa and 10000 K (Boates et al., <ref type="bibr">PNAS, 2012, 109, 14808-14812)</ref>. Extension of the phase diagram of carbon dioxide is fundamental for pure chemistry and physics of matter, helping us to understand better the nature of the chemical bond. On top of that, this experiment expands our knowledge on the prototypical carbon-bearing system to yet more extreme high temperature and pressure conditions relevant to the geotherm, and therefore has profound implications to the deep carbon cycle.  <ref type="bibr">PNAS, 2012, 109, 14808-14812)</ref>. The conditions relevant to the geotherm are shown in green. The dashed line corresponds to isothermal compression up to ca. 85 GPa, the dotted lines show the tentative heating and cooling cycle, the dash-dot line follows the decompression run.
