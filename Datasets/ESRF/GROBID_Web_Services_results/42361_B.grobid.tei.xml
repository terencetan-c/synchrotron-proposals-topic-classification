<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Following a work done in 2008-2009 on the analysis of calcium antimonates used as opacifiers in ancient glasses technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> (report EC-281), our aim, in the present experiment, was to extend this research on the complex family of lead antimonates. These yellow compounds have a predominant role throughout history as they are found from the 3 rd millenium BC in Mesopotamia, until modern times. They were used as glass colorant and opacifier but also in the glazed decorations of ceramics and later as painting pigments. In this study, three opaque glass productions were analyzed: Egyptian glass of the 18th dynasty (1570-1292 BC), Roman mosaic tesserae and beads from Aquilea and Rome (2nd c. B.C -5th c. AD) and Nevers lampworking glass figures (18th c. AD) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Our objectives were to determine to which extent the crystal composition and the Sb and Sn speciation could be specific of the different productions. The possibility to get clues about the ingredients used for the glass manufacturing was also assessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples:</head><p>Were studied: Four Egyptian opaque decorated glass shards dating from the 18th dynasty (1570-1292 BC) and coming from the Louvre museum(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), for yellow roman mosaic tesserae -one coming from Aquilea (181 BC to 452 A.D), one from Rome (390 AD), and two from Saint-Romain en Gal (2nd-3rd AD), (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), two green opaque glasses from Nevers figurines dating from the 18th c. A.D and coming from the Museum of Decorative Arts of Paris are studied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). For all the samples, micro-sampling (0.2 x 0.5 cm 2 ) were taken, embedded in resin and polished. Additional SEM and Raman analyses were performed.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>The lead antimonate crystals are rather small (~20µm max), but, as observed, sometimes very heterogeneous (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). It was therefore essential to use a submicrometric beam. The beam size was reduced to 0.8×0.4 µm 2 (horizontal × vertical) thanks to Fresnel zone plates. The second technical challenge was related to the possible additional presence of tin, with lead and antimony in the crystals. Sb and Sn have emission L-lines which are quite close and which can hardly be differentiated with EDS detectors. Besides, the Ca present in glass matrix also complicate this lines identification as the Ca K-lines are falling in the same region (3.5-4keV). For this reason, the high spectral resolution provided by the WDS at ID21 was very useful (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). It was in particular necessary to determine with high accuracy to presence or absence of tin, and was also fully exploited for the acquisition of µXANES at the Sb and Sn Kedges (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). For this measurement, a Si(111) crystal was chosen, giving access to both Ca, K-, Sb, Sn Land to Pb M-lines. For data processing, we have exploited recent possibilities offered by the PyMCA software for statistical analysis. In particular, we wanted to extract relative composition (in Sb, Sn, Ca and Pb) of the different principal components identified in the crystals. This approach was useful in order to compare the composition of one sample with another, one production with another. µXANES spectra were collected at the Sb and Sn L 1 -edges. As demonstrated in previous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> , direct identification of the oxidation state can be obtained working at these edges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>One of the most important results is that lead antimonate production evolves throughout History. Differences between the three productions could be clearly highlighted and hypotheses about glass manufacturing are drawn <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . In particular, our results show that a very homogeneous process has been used to produce lead antimonate crystals in all the Egyptian yellow glasses studied whereas Roman glasses show various heterogeneities at different scales, indicating that no strict recipe was used. On the other hand, a more controlled process than in Roman time is used for Nevers modern glasses, likely based on the Muranese recipe books. In one atypical sample, it was even possible to observe Sb in 2 different oxidation states, which was interpreted as the result of a mixture of reactants and products in a single aggregate.</p><p>Specially for the Roman and Nevers glass productions, the heterogeneity observed from one sample to another, but also within the same sample, and even more within a single crystal aggregate (e.g. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) clearly shows that a production cannot be unequivocally associated to a single chemical composition. This work emphasizes the necessity of using high resolution micro analytical techniques to investigate this type of materials. Since tin is commonly found with a mixture of Pb and Sb, in other productions of opaque glass or in yellow glass-based pigments dating from the 16th-late 19th cent. AD [16, 18-27], this methodology can be applied to the study of yellow pigments for painting or glazed ceramics. Here we have seen that one cannot conclude about the raw materials, the recipe and the process used according to the measurement on a single area of the artefact. It is of main importance to collect data of this type to find out more on the original recipe and the raw materials employed.</p><p>Results have been presented to the SR2A 2010 conference and an article was submitted in Dec 2010 to JAAS.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1 Opaque coloured glass productions. a) Shard of the 18 th Egyptian Dynasty (inventory number AF12707 © C2RMF/ D.
