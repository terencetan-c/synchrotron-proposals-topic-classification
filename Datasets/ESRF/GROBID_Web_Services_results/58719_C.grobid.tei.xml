<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Role of the coupling between transition-metals and rare-earths in the metamagnetic behaviour of Ba 2 LnFeO 5 perovskite derivatives </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In oxides containing both transition-metal (3d) and rare-earth (4f) cations, the 3d-3d interaction is largely predominant in the overwhelming majority of cases. As a general rule, the 3d-4f and 4f-4f interactions only play a role at temperatures much lower than the magnetic spin ordering, which is itself dictated solely by the 3d-3d coupling. Recently, we synthesized a new family of perovskite derivatives in which the 3d-3d and 3d-4f interactions turn out to be of comparable strengths <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. These compounds of formulation Ba 2 LnFeO 5 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, as well as Y) exhibit a peculiar lattice structure in which isolated FeO 4 tetrahedra are linked by LnO 6 octahedra. As a result, the usually strong superexchange (SE) Fe-O-Fe coupling is absent and one is left in a situation where only a weaker super-superexchange (SSE) Fe-O-O-Fe mechanism competes with SE Fe-O-Ln. Magnetic and calorimetric measurements showed that each of these Ba 2 LnFeO 5 compounds exhibits a unique, antiferromagnetic transition involving both the 3d and 4f ions.</p><p>When applying magnetic field at T&lt;&lt;T N , the magnetization curves display puzzling behaviors depending on the 4f cation. It remains that the interpretation of the metamagnetic-like effects is hard to establish on the basis of bulk magnetometry only. XANES/XMCD experiments have been carried out at the Fe K-edge and Ln L 2,3 -edges in order to disentangle the transition-metal and rare-earth contributions in the global magnetic response of a few representative Ba 2 LnFeO 5 compositions. Corresponding X-ray magnetic circular dichrosim (XMCD) spectra.</p><p>The Fe K-edge XANES and XMCD spectra measured at T = 2.2 K are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. One can observe a great similarity of both the XANES and XMCD spectral shapes for all Ba 2 LnFeO 5 materials. The five selected compositions present an intense pre-peak on the XANES spectra particularly pronounced due to the tetrahedral environment of Fe. It is associated with the largest XMCD feature in Fig . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b</ref>). It should be highlighted that the XMCD spectral shape of the Ba 2 LnFeO 5 Ln= Yb, Tb, Ho, Er is similar to that of Ba 2 YFeO 5. This is a crucial point for further analysis, as it demonstrates that the Fe K-edge XMCD is not dominated by hybridization with rare-earth states, so that the Fe K-edge XMCD truly represents the Fe (4p,3d) moments. XANES and XMCD spectra were measured at the L 2,3 edges of Yb, Tb, Ho and Er in Ba 2 LnFeO 5 materials (an attempt has been done on Y, but unsuccessful due to diffraction peaks). From these XMCD spectra, an energy point has been selected, and its field dependence recorded from -17 to +17 T. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (b) to (f) shows the field dependence of the rare-earth XMCD in regards to that of Fe in the same conditions. One can clearly see that the rare-earth contribution mimics the bulk magnetization measurements shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (a), in particular it accounts for most the metamagnetic jump, while the change in curvature on Fe turns out to be rather small. In addition, Ba XMCD spectra were measured at L 2 and L 3 for Ba 2 ErFeO 5 . Besides being one of the first measurements of XMCD on barium, these data also show that the induced moments on Ba are dominated by hybridization with Fe states.</p><p>To sum up, element specific magnetic information were successfully obtained by XMCD as a function of the magnetic field.</p><p>At first sight, these data are well suitable to bring new insights into the metamagnetic behavior observed in bulk magnetometry experiments. Further analyses are in progess. REF: A. K Kundu, V. Hardy, V. Caignaert, and B. Raveau, J. Phys.: Condens.
