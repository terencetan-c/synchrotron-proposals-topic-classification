<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main goal of this study was to obtain the local crystal deformation induced by the implantation of antimony and to record these lattice deformations as a function of annealing conditions in order to evidence the dynamics of the diffusion/activation processes. This study provides us with all expected results and constitutes the chapter 4.2 of the successfully defended PhD thesis of A. Tuaz <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The ternary alloy Hg1-xCdxTe is of Zinc-Blende type and is constituted by 2 face-centred cubic sublattices (named A and B afterwards) offsetted by [¼,¼,¼] with the anion sub-lattice made of Tellurium while the cation sub-lattice hosts either Hg or Cd. Consequently, (hkl) reflections are only allowed if Miller indexes h, k and l have the same parity and their sum is either odd (odd indexes) or even (even indexes). Concerning their intensities, there is a major difference for even Miller indexes: (hkl) reflections with h+k+l=4n have an amplitude proportional to the square of the sum of atomic form factor (fA+fB) 2 while h+k+l=4n+2 have an amplitude proportional to the square of the difference of atomic form factor (fA-fB) 2 . Consequently, h+k+l=4n reflections are strong while 4n+2 reflections are weak.</p><p>As shown in table <ref type="table">1</ref> for as-implanted sample, the diffraction signal almost goes down to background level in a 500 nm deep and 8 µm wide zone situated at the centre of the image, thus perfectly localising the Sb implantation zone. Moreover, that zone is roughly 250-500 nm thick, perfectly corresponding to the expected penetration length of Sb ions: diffraction intensity reduces because of implantation-induced damages. A detailed comparison shows that the weak diffraction intensity is 1.5 time more reduced than the strong one. The proposed explanation is that misfit dislocations occur in the damaged zone, thus inducing stacking faults in the crystal that locally transform the AB atomic structure into BA structure. Therefore, the two cfc sub-lattices are no more exclusively made of cations or anions, but of a mixture of both in various proportions: fA and fB difference lowers. And whatever the proportion of anion/cation mixing, this does not affect strong reflections but specifically decreases weak reflections until -in the limit case where anions and cations are fully mixed-upweak reflection are zero since fA=fB.</p><p>After annealing, we observe a restoration of the diffraction signal in the implanted zone but this restoration looks incomplete. This clearly contrasts with the case of As implanted HgCdTe structures (object of a previous thesis <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>) where after annealing, the epilayer was completely cured. We think this may be linked to the apparition of nanometric voids in the last 500 nm epilayer with a 10 times larger density for Sb (65.5 µm -2 ) than for As (6.4 µm -2 ). Moreover, we specifically observe for the annealed sample in the 2 µm height surface zoom, that a triangular zone appears (shown in dashed white line) where we observe a 35% reduced diffraction intensity that exists both of weak and strong peak. This is quite a non-expected phenomenon since -contrary to all expected diffusion processes -it seems not to be isotropic and to the author's knowledge, it is an unknown phenomenon. We also see such an effect on the 2D strain repartition under the form of a weakened strain as illustrated. We think this non-isotropic phenomenon is worth developing a new axis of research.</p><p>Before annealing After annealing WEAK (-4 10 8) 17.5 keV 4 µm height Surface zoom STRONG (-2, 10, 8) 19.1 keV 4 µm height Surface zoom STRAIN 10 µm height strain range [-7;3.5]10 -4</p><p>Table 1: Comparison of strong and weak peak intensity repartitions in the 4 µm surface of the epilayer, both in the as-implanted and annealed case. The 2D strain mesh is also presented.</p><p>Another important aspect here is that this phenomenon is width limited by the implantation: despite SIMS, RBS and MEIS have much better adapted depth resolution in the 1 nm range, their millimetric beam size is a prohibitory drawback here because it would require making an as-large implantation, and we would probably loose the width limiting phenomena. This probably explains why this phenomenon has never been observed before and why only micro-probing experiments would be relevant here.</p><p>[1] A.
