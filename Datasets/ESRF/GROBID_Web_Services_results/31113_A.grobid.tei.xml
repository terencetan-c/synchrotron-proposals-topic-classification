<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment we planned to investigate the mechanism of the oxidation of [(en) 2 Co(SCH 2 CH 2 NH 2 )](ClO 4 ) 2 ] (CoSR 2+ ) by the catalyst CH 3 ReO 3 /H 2 O 2 at room temperature (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This oxidation reaction may lead to a convenient synthesis of organic sulfoxides, disulfides, or sulfonic acids. 1 Although this reaction has been studied by electronic spectroscopy to obtain kinetic data, no structural information on the reactive intermediates could be extracted. 2 In order to be able to attain such information we performed the experiment by means of complementary techniques (stopped-flow/UV-Vis/Dispersive-EXAFS (EDE)) synchronised at the millisecond range.</p><p>Figure1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Acetonitrile solutions of CH 3 ReO 3 and CoSR 2+ were prepared off-line. Final mixures in the stopped-flow cuvette contained 20mM of Re. EDE measures were monitored on the Re L III -edge <ref type="bibr">(10.535 KeV)</ref>. During this experiment we improved the normalisation method of the spectra by doing a tailored modification in the software, which allowed us to obtain the Io as the solvent in exactly the same spot where data was taken for the sample. This normalisation method improved significantly the quality of the data, and we could get reliable information down to 8mM of Re. The first reaction monitored was the CH 3 ReO 3 with H 2 O 2 . This was extreamily problematic because of bubble formation induced by the beam. This made this reaction impossible to follow by means of EDE experiments. As such, we decided to monitore another related reaction: the deactivation of CH 3 ReO 3 by competing pathways in basic acetonitrile solutions, in particular NaOH. 3 The time resolution of this experiment was 600 ms. Small but consistent changes in the XANES region could be observed. This could be attributed, in average, to a change in the type of Re-O bonding. We are planning to apply in the near future a fitting routine for the XANES region (MXAN program) to obtain quantitative structural information and compare it with FEFF8.2 simulations.</p><p>0 0.5 1 1.5 2 10.4 10.5 10.6 10.7 10.8 10.9 11 11.1 Abs Energy (KeV) 40 mM 28 mM 13 mM 8 mM 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 1.05 10 4 1.053 10 4 1.057 10 4 1.06 10 4 Starting material Final Product Abs Energy (eV)</p><p>During the last day of the experiment we changed energy to the Co K-edge (7.709 KeV) so we could obtain static spectra of all different reactants of the original reaction. In this case we tested new cuvettes (capillary with diameter of 1.5mm) in collaboration with ID02. These gave positive results and consequently these cuvettes are going to be used to study the soft edges on ID24, such as Cr, Mn and Fe, with this stoppedflow/UV-Vis/EDE facility.</p><p>1.
