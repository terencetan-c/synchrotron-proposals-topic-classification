<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Thin films (thickness of ~300 nm) were prepared by the sol-gel spin-coating method onto silica glass disk substrates (matrix composition: SiO 2 -TiO 2 , SiO 2 -TiO 2 -HfO 2 , SiO 2 -HfO 2 ), where Er, Ag and/or Yb are incorporated by ion implantation. Two sol-gel based bulk silica samples, where Ag and/or Er were incorporated by pore-doping, instead of ion implantation, were also analyzed (Sample A10 is doped with Er and sample A11 is doped with Er and Ag). The photoluminescence (PL) at ~1.54 µm was measured for all samples, heat treated at 900º C after implantation; however its signal is not very intense, probably due to the small thickness of the films. UV/Vis absorption was performed on samples containing silver.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions:</head><p>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed in grazing incidence geometry, in a dedicated experimental chamber operative at the GILDA-CRG beamline (ESRF beamline BM08), in fluorescence mode, at 6 GeV, at room temperature, by using a Si (111) monochromator and a 13elements high purity Ge detector. The spectra were recorded from 8100 to 9200 eV. An Er 2 O 3 compound powder was used as reference standard (obtained in transmission mode). The Er 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Er 2 Si 2 O 7 compounds were also taken into account at the fitting procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L III Er-edge measurements with grazing incidence in fluorescence mode:</head><p>For all samples, the average position of the first peak (ca. 1.90 Ǻ, without correction for the phase shift) appears similar to that of Er 2 O 3 , for which the first atomic polyhedron consists of six oxygen neighbors at an average value of 2.26 Ǻ. Thus, we can conclude that the erbium species are present as Er 3+ cations involved in Er-O bonds, since the first neighbor distance in metallic erbium is larger than 3 Ǻ [9].</p><p>(The model employed for the fitting procedure considers that the coordination number of Er-Si is the same as the CN of Er-O. Also, the fit was done in K space, k 2 , 2.0-7.7)</p><p>Below are some results and conclusions derived from this work:</p><p>1. Same results with different grazing incidence angles were obtained, which indicate that the Er 3+ ion environment remains similar as a function of film depth.</p><p>2. Different Er contents, as well as the presence of Yb, did not appear to modify the local structure around Er. In fact, its first neighbor was always found to be oxygen (CN~6, r~2.27Ǻ, σ~0.015).</p><p>Second neighbor fitting always resulted in Er-O-Si bondings (CN~6, r~3.58, σ~0.02). 3. The presence of ionic and metallic silver had no noticeable effect on the Er 3+ surroundings, regarding first and second neighbors (CN oxyg =6, r=2.28Ǻ, σ~0.015 and CN Si ~6, r=3.58, σ~0.02). 4. The Er 3+ environment was similar in all matrices analyzed: silica-titania (ST), silica-hafnia (SH) and silica-titania-hafnia (STH), when the heat treatment performed after ion implantation was at 600º C. However, significant differences arose in samples heat treated at 900º C, namely in the STH matrix, as shown in Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In fact, STHB sample (heat treated at 900º C) presents the first and second shells (especially the second one) shifted to longer distances, when compared to STHA, silica-titania and silica-hafnia samples, suggesting a more open structure with either a) Si as second neighbor, (b) a different 2 nd neighbor, such as Hf or, (c) eventually, a combination of Si and Hf, of the same type as the reported for SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 in reference <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>. For instance, second shell parameters are CN~6.12, r~3.600 Ǻ and σ~0.029, for STHA and CN~6.28, r~3.654 Ǻ, σ~0.016 for STHB. It should be noted also that the 2 nd shell region appears more well-defined and intense for sample STHB, which might suggest that the Er environment is more crystallized, more ordered, for this sample, when compared to sample STHA. Moreover, STHA seems to present an intermediate behavior, in terms of bonding distance, between STB or SH900B and STHB, as shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. 5. Heat treatment in SH900 samples also seems to have a minor influence in the Er environment, since the first shell becomes more intense with the heat treatment at 900º C (sample SH900B), which means higher Er-O coordination number (or lower structural disorder), whereas in the second shell this does not occur. In silica-titania matrices, two Er 3+ ions are likely to be bridged by a SiO 4 tetrahedron and, therefore, the increase in oxygen coordination number corresponds to an increase in CN of Si <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. However, in SiO 2 -HfO 2 samples the intensity of the second shell is not correlated with that of the first shell. This behavior could be related with the presence of Hf, that is known to disrupt the SiO 2 network [10]. 6. Sol-gel derived samples, where Ag and/or Er were incorporated by pore-doping (A10, with Er and A11, with Er and Ag), seem to exhibit a quite different radial-distribution of neighbors, as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows. However, such differences are not well depicted at the representation in K space, which brings some doubts to the previous observation. These samples have to be carefully studied, by repeating EXAFS analyses and/or by using other fitting programs. It should be noted that such a different environment around Er ions might explain the quite different photoluminescence peak shape in samples A10 and A11 at 1.5 µm, namely the much lower FWHM observed in sample A11 (~24 nm), when compared to sample A10 (~33 nm).
