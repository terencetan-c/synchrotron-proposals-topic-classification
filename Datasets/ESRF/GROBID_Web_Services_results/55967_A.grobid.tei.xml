<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Slip transfer through interfaces due to local stress concentration Experiment number: Beamline: BM32 Date of experiment: from: 28.04.2015 to: 04.05.2015 Date of report: Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): Jean-Sebastien Micha Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Christoph Kirchlechner* Nataliya Malyar* Dr. Jaya Balila Prof. Dr. Gerhard Dehm Report:</p><p>Aim of the underlying proposal was to measure the local stress concentration at the grainboundary by in situ µLaue diffraction in order to understand slip transfer through grainboundaries.</p><p>The beamtime was succesful in terms of (i) number of performed experiments (ii) quality of performed experiments (iii) beam stability One problem we had during the beamtime was the limited read-out time of the CCD detector system at BM32. A faster readout would thereby allow for strainrate sensitivity measurements, which we would like to vary in the 10 -2 -10 -5 s -1 regime.</p><p>Ad 1) we planned to deform 7 bi-crystalline micropillars and 10 single crystalline reference samples. The aforementioned amount of samples, and additional 3/5 "back-up" samples had been prepared by FIB techniques in our home laboratory and succesfully deformed.</p><p>Ad 2) Both, the initial Laue patterns (in terms of circular peak shape and residual strains) as well as the mechanical experiments (in terms of alignment and control of displacment) worked extraordinary well. After analyzing most of the data in early 2016 we are sure that we aligned all samples better 0.2°. Also, the aimed stress state was always reached precisely (+/-2%).</p><p>Ad 3) Compared to formed experiments the beam stability at BM32 (it´s position and size) considerable improved.</p><p>Data analysis and interpretation is still ongoing and simultaneously performed by one PhD candidate (Nataliya Malyar), one postdoctoral researcher (Dr. Anton Davydok) and one principal investigator (Dr. Christoph Kirchlechner). Even though the number of dislocations and the stresses could not simultaneously be analyzed yet, the experiments provide localized lattice strain measurement with an resolution better 10 -4 . Other insights into the dislocation grain-boundary interaction were additionally obtained. For instance, we were able to show the change of the grain-boundary angle during loading as the simplest measure for the grain-boundary character during in situ loading (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This change strongly depends on the grain-boundary character (transmission factor) -with some grain-boundaries beeing a strong sink for dislocations.</p><p>Based on the Laue experiments it could also been shown, that the pillar geometry used worldwide suffers from considerable constraints also in the bi-crystalline case. While they are weaker in the bi-crystal (compared to the single crystals), it is clear, that the upper and lower third of the compression pillar is dominated by lateral constraints. Only the center of the sample shows little constraints and thus, reveals the "intrinsic" material behaviour. To our knowledge this was only be prooven by such kinds of Laue experiments yet.</p><p>We expect major results during the next month beeing published in an leading peer reviewed journal of the field (we aim for Acta Materialia). In the future we want to extend our work by analyzing the grain-boundary character prior to deformation on the atomic scale and try to understand differences in the individual deformation behavior. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 (a) Post mortem SEM analysis of a general HAGB showing one family of slip steps in grain A and two kinds of slip steps in grain B.
