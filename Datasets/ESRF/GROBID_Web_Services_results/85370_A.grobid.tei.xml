<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This work focuses on TiO 2 :Sn and TiO 2 :N,Sn nanostructured powders for advanced photo-electrochemical applications. In the first part of the experiment, high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction patterns of a total of 22 samples were collected at the ID-22 beamline. This set of results will be complemented by XAS (XANES/EXAFS) data at the Sn L1 and Sn K edges, which will be collected at the LISA beamline (BM08) at a later date; the beamtime at LISA was postponed due to delays in the refurbishing of the beamline and was not yet rescheduled.</p><p>Analyzed samples. Both pristine, N-doped and N,Sn-copromoted TiO 2 samples were analyzed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Three different synthetic approaches were compared for the preparation of TiO 2 :N,Sn systems: the mechanical mixing of a titania xerogel and nanosized hydrothermal SnO 2 ; the seeded growth of TiO 2 using crystalline SnO 2 germs; a sol-gel approach using both titanium alkoxide and a Sn salt as precursors (bulk approach). All of the prepared samples were finally calcined at 400°C in oxygen flux. Commercial and ad hoc synthesized TiO 2 and SnO 2 samples were also analyzed as references. X-ray powder diffraction data were collected at RT from 3° to 48° in 2 in Debye-Scherrer capillary geometry using Si-111 monochromatized X-rays at 29 keV. A multianalyzer stage with nine Si(111) analyzer crystals was employed throughout. Each diffraction pattern was thus obtained from the weighted average of the signals recorded by each module of the detector array. The X-rays wavelength, the offsets of each channel and the corresponding efficiency were calibrated using the NIST 640c Si standard. The Rietveld method was exlpoited to fit experimental diffractograms thorugh the GSAS program as implemented in the EXPGUI package. Selected samples were measured also under in situ irradiation with UV light from a portable UV torch. Long acquisitions were also carried out on the pristine SnO 2 specimens, characterized by a low crystallinity degree, in order to carry out pair distribution function (PDF) analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head># sample name synthetic procedure N-doping Sn/Ti molar ratio</head><p>Main results. Most of the TiO 2 samples are composed of anatase (I4 1 /amd) as main phase and of a small amount of brookite (Pbca), whose specific signature is the (211) reflection at ≈ 8.4 deg (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). The different synthetic procedures exert a notable influence on the structural properties of the samples. In particular, in the bulk series, the Sn addition promotes the formation of rutile TiO 2 (P4 2 /mnm), as appreciable from the peak at ca. 7.5 deg, at the expenses of the other TiO 2 polymorphs. Moreover, for this series, segregated cassiterite SnO 2 (P4 2 /mnm, signature peak at ca. 9.2 deg) cannot be appreciated even at high Sn content. On the other hand, a rutile promotion effect is not observed for the seeded growth and mechanical mixing series, where instead cassiterite SnO 2 is clearly appreciable. The main difference between the two latter series is related to the SnO 2 content, which in one case is compatible with the nominal amount, whereas in the seeded growth accounts for a small part of the nominal content. In this respect, the structure of the nanosized SnO 2 germs adopted in both synthetic routes was investigated via PDF analyses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). In addition, XAS experiments will integrate this picture, providing information about the location of the Sn and N species, especially for the samples where no segregated SnO 2 phases are appreciable. a) b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Experiment title :</head><label>title</label><figDesc>Probing local and long-range structure of N-doped TiO 2 -based composite (TiO 2 , Sn/SnO 2 ) materials for advanced photo-electrochemical applications Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Daniela Meroni* , Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Silvia Ardizzone, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Luca Rimoldi* , Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Leonardo Lo Presti* , Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy Laura Loconte, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy</figDesc></figure>
