<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Powder neutron diffraction and resonant x-ray scattering measurements from a single crystal have been performed to study the low-temperature state of the 2D frustrated, quantum-Heisenberg system Li2VOSiO4. Both techniques indicate a collinear antiferromagnetic ground state, with propagation vector k = (½, ½, 0), and magnetic moments in the a-b plane. Contrary to previous reports, the ordered moment at 1.44 K, m = 0.63(3)  B , is very close to the value expected for the square lattice Heisenberg model (~0:6  B ). The magnetic order is three dimensional, with antiferromagnetic a-b layers stacked ferromagnetically along the c axis. Neither x-ray nor neutron diffraction shows evidence for a structural distortion between 1.6 and 10 K.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment was performed in the horizontal geometry, which implies incident photons with polarization parallel to the scattering plane (). The first part of the experiment was dedicated to the search of structural distortions with a better resolution (d=d = 0.005) than that allowed by powder neutron diffraction. The second part of the experiment was performed around the Vabsorption K edge (5.465 keV), to measure the temperature dependence of the magnetic signal. A pyrolitic graphite (004) reflection was used to analyse whether the polarization of the scattered beam was parallel or perpendicular to the scattering plane. RXS allows us to distinguish between the collinear and the noncollinear structures compatible with neutron powder-diffraction results and to probe directly the dimensionality of the magnetic structure. The results obtained by this experiment have been published by <ref type="bibr">A. Bombardi et al. in PRL 93, 027202 (2004)</ref>.</p><p>A. <ref type="bibr">Bombardi et al., PRL 93, 027202 (2004)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="1,133.26,540.18,327.84,163.57" type="bitmap" /></figure>
