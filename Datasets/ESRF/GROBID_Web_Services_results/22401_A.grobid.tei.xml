<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Previous experiments at -5°°°°C showed that the samples were completely ergodic at long time scales and there is a cross over between two diffusive motions corresponding to self-diffusion of the micelles within their cages and the mutual diffusion due to the rearrangement of the micellar cages [3]. Preliminary experiments were also attempted with cesium neutralised random ionomers based on polystyrene sulfonate at low charge fractions (&lt;3% charge fraction) and ferritin from horse spleen. The static characterisation of the random ionomers showed the scattered X-ray intensity to be too small to ensure reliable XPCS experiments, whereas in the case of the ferritin samples showed promising results. However, care would be required with the effects of beam damage with these sensitive biological samples. Regarding the ionomers, we are planning to repeat the experiments with samples in which the cesium content is higher to obtain better scattering and also investigate the possibility of different molecular weights and chemical groups in the polymer. In particular we would like to study the dynamic in semi-dilute and concentrated regimes of polystyrene-acrylate and polystyrene methacrylate ionomers. 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 1.525 1.530 1.535 1.540 1.545 1.550 1.555 1.560 1.565 g 2 (t) t(s)</p></div>

The aquisition of static frames in time has been performed using a CCD detector. These data have been consequently correlated in time with the Yorick based software. Yorick is a tool for analysing numerical data that has been found particularly useful in image analysis[2]. The experiment provided us with some unexpected results upon initial analysis. The correlation functions from the ionomer micelles shows a non-ergodic behaviour as the temperature was lowered to -17°°°°C. That is the long time intercept of the intensity correlation function is no longer equal to zero. It has been possible to collect correlation curves in a concentration range between 10% and 20% w/v. For concentrations below 10% the dynamic was too fast to be recorded with accuracy. In concentrations above 20% it seems that the dynamics are frozen in the glassy state. An example of the correlation curves obtained is given in figure1where a single exponential with a nonergodic offset has been used as a curve fit. The use of Yorick also enabled us to analyse the stability of the x-ray beam during the acquisition of the frames. We found that some fluctuations of the beam intensity are present and this behaviour can explain the noisy tail in the correlation curves.</figDesc></figure>
